 11:02 UT and occurred at a tailward distance of 7,800 km. The spacecraft                                                         
 was inside the bow wave for roughly 3 hours and in the main tail for about

 coordinate system, defined by the JPL group before launch. I is the unit                                                         
 vector in the direction of the ICE spin axis (positive in the northward                                                          
 direction), and S is the unit vector from the spacecraft to the Sun.  The                                                        
 z-axis is equal to I, the y-axis to the normalized cross-product I x S,                                                          
 and the x-axis to Y x Z.  The I,S coordinate system is approximately the                                                         
 same as the Solar Ecliptic (SE) system since the spacecraft z-axis is

 small number that do appear in these data. JPL does not hand-edit the high

 for noise spikes when doing averaging or other analyses. There is no

 The following information (and the table of noise spikes given above) has                                                        
 been provided by J. Wolf (JPL), after examining plots of the magnetic field                                                      
 data during the comet encounter: The highest legitimate value of Bmagnitude                                                      
 is 59.21 at 11:01:01.29 on Day 254, at the time of closest approach to the                                                       
 comet. On Day 254, one should eliminate points with Bmagnitude greater                                                           
 than 40 from 09:00 to 11:00 and from 11:10 to 13:00. During the interval                                                         
 11:00 to 11:10, points with Bmagnitude greater than 60 should be eliminated.                                                     
 For the rest of this 5 day interval, one should eliminate points with                                                            
 Bmagnitude greater than 20 nT.
