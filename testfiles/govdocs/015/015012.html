Canadian Hydro Developers, Inc.(TSX:KHD) today announced it has entered into a new contract for the sale of EcoLogo(TM) certified green power with the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, one of the world's premier hotels, located in Banff National Park. Under the new agreement, the Chateau will purchase 3,300,000 kilowatt hours per year for five years, or 40% of the hotel's power requirements, of certified low-impact, renewable green power from Canadian Hydro. This represents a 31% increase in green power over that purchased in 2001 by the Chateau from the Company, as well as a two year extension from the last contract. The use of green power by the Chateau will offset 3,300 tonnes per year of CO2 emissions that would have otherwise been created with conventional, coal-based power. The Chateau is the largest purchaser of green powerin Canada's National Parks. &quot;We are very pleased the Chateau has significantly increased their commitment to the environment by purchasing an impressive 40% of their power from low-impact, renewable energy,&quot; said John Keating, Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Hydro. &quot;The Chateau hopes to provide a powerful example of how one company can make a difference to the environment and provide leadership to other consumers of power,&quot; said David Huggill, environmental Systems Manager of Chateau Lake Louise. Canadian Hydro is a developer, owner and operator of thirteen generating facilities: nine &quot;run of river&quot; hydroelectric plants, three wind plants and one natural gas-fired plant, totalling 88.9 MW net to the Company's interest. In addition, the Pingston Hydroelectric Plant (15 MW net) is currently under construction and approximately 223 MW are in various stages of permitting for construction in the nextfive years. All of the Company's plants and projects are located in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. All of Canadian Hydro's wind and water plants are certified under the EcoLogo(TM) program. Canadian Hydro is committed to the concept of low-impact power generation. Through its wind, run-of-river hydro and biomass facilities, Canadian Hydro is demonstrating that commitment to the benefit of the environment and its shareholders. <em>Source: E-Wire May 2. 2002.</em>

<span id="hd">NACECGreen Mountain Power and Clean Air -- Cool Planet Team Up</span><br>
With a novel approach, Green Mountain Power (NYSE: GMP) and an environmental nonprofit Clean Air -- Cool Planet (CA-CP) have joined forces to enable Green Mountain Power's customers to help build new renewable energy resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through two programs called &quot;CoolHome(SM)&quot; and &quot;CoolBusiness(SM)&quot;, CA-CP will keep carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air for each participant by helping to build a new wind turbine and a Vermont farm methane system that will reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels is the primary source of the greenhouse gases - principally CO2 - that contribute to global warming. For a one-time donation of just $60, each coolHome(SM) participant will help to offset 6 tons of CO2 emissions - the amount of an average Vermont home's annual heating fuel and electricity use. With the CoolBusiness(SM) program, businesses learn how much CO2 emissions they cause and choose the amount they wish to offset. Green Mountain Power has taken the lead by offsetting a year's worth of CO2 emissions - 290 tons - from both powering and heating its corporate and operations facility in Colchester. &quot;Offering this program to our customers is a natural extension of our corporate commitment to protecting the environment,&quot; said Stephen C. Terry, Senior Vice President of Green Mountain Power. &quot;We already have an energy supply mix that is unusually low in emissions, and now our customers can choose to lessen the impact of the total energy use in their home. This program is much like the WARMTH support program, only here our customers can make donations to help fight global warming, in a similar way that our customers help low-income customers heat their homes,&quot; said Mr. Terry. &quot;We also hope that other electric utilities will consider this new voluntary program as they develop ways customers can fight global warming,&quot; he added.
</p>

<p>
&quot;The CoolHome(SM) and CoolBusiness(SM) programs provide a way for Green Mountain Power's customers to contribute to global warming solutions,&quot; says Adam Markham, Executive Director of CA-CP. &quot;By helping build new renewable energy sources, we can neutralize the impact of our own energy use by causing reductions in fossil fuel emissions. We believe that Green Mountain Power is the first utility in the Northeast to offer its customers a way to offset their total energy use by supporting the development of new renewable resources.&quot; CA-CP plans to work with Vermont-based NativeEnergy to acquire the emission reductions because NativeEnergy's services drive the construction of new renewable generators, nationally and locally, creating new environmental benefits. The CoolHome(SM) program will help build the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Wind Turbine Project in South Dakota, the first Native American owned and operated large-scale wind turbine. It will displace electricity that would otherwise come mostly from burning coal &quot;upwind&quot; from Vermont. About half of the CO2 emission reductions will come from a new farm- methane project in Bradford, Vermont that will eliminate lagoon storage of manure, and capture and use methane gas. The project will avoid direct emissions of methane gas and will displace fossil fuel use for the space and process heat. &quot;Even though Vermont's electricity mix is a relatively low CO2 emission source, we can help place wind turbines in other areas that are not as fortunate, and utilize those reductions to offset the CO2 emissions from our heating and other fossil fuel use. The Vermont farm project can directly address local farm waste and energy use right here at home,&quot; says Tom Boucher, President &amp; CEO of NativeEnergy. All money donated will go directly to CA-CP for renewable energy programs. Green Mountain Power will retain none of the donation proceeds. Green Mountain Power Corporation is a Vermont-based energy services company serving 87,000 electric customers. See more info at www.greenmountainpower.biz including the new CoolHome program information at www.greenmountainpower.biz/coolhome. Clean Air - Cool Planet is an action-oriented environmental group working directly with corporations, communities, and campuses to develop and implement voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. A 501(c)(3) qualified non-profit organization, CA-CP works throughout the Northeast to provide practical solutions that demonstrate the economic opportunities and environmental benefits associated with early actions on climate change. CA-CP works directly with a growing number of companies and institutions that exemplify leadership and social responsibility, including Shaw's Supermarkets, The Timberland Company, Tufts University, Middlebury College, and The University of New Hampshire. See www.cleanair-coolplanet.org. NativeEnergy is located in N. Ferrisburgh, VT, and offers individuals and businesses simple, effective, and verifiable ways to fight global warming and climate change. NativeEnergy's patent-pending business process offers a convenient alternative to buying green electricity and is dedicated exclusively to driving the construction of new wind farms and other renewables to create new environmental benefits.

<span id="hd">Green Mountain Expands To Include Central Power and Light Area in Texas</span><br>
Green Mountain Energy Co., the nation's largest and fastest-growing residential provider of cleaner energy, announced April 2 that effective immediately it is expanding its operations in Texas, saying that it would offer customers in the Central Power &amp; Light (CP&amp;L) service territory the opportunity to sign up for electricity generated from 100 percent pollution-free wind power. The company also unveiled its &quot;Easyrate&quot; pricing for CP&amp;L customers, which provides a flat rate designed to deliver the added benefit of protecting customers from seasonal rate fluctuations. The price for Green Mountain Energy service will be 8.8 cents/kWh for customers in the CP&amp;L service territory. Customers also will be charged a $4.95 per month customer service fee. The CP&amp;L service territory includes Corpus Christi, Victoria,
Harlingen, McAllen and parts of Brownsville. &quot;We are excited about offering CP&amp;L customers a simple way to purchase pollution-free electricity and help clean the air we breathe,&quot; said Gillan Taddune, president of the Texas region for Green Mountain Energy Company. &quot;As customers flip the switch on their lights, we hope they will consider that making electricity is the dirtiest industry in America in terms of air pollution. The Texas electric choice program gives people the opportunity to buy electricity that is 100% clean and pollution-free.&quot; Taddune explained that by purchasing Green Mountain Energy electricity, the average Texas household can avoid contributing over 20,000 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air each year. This is a significant reduction in the amount of CO2 an average household emits annually, she said-approximately equal to not driving round-trip from Corpus Christi to Brownsville 62 times. Green Mountain Energy electricity is generated exclusively by wind farms located within Texas, which produce no air pollution. It is also the only Green-e-certified product available in the state. Green Mountain has been signing up customers in the Reliant and TXU service territories since April of last year. The company said it has been encouraged by the call volume in the past months from customers in the CP&amp;L territory who want to sign up. &quot;Customers have been calling since the beginning of the pilot program last year asking when we were coming to the CP&amp;L territory, so they could sign up for our 100% pollution-free wind power,&quot; said Taddune. &quot;This customer demand, combined with our tremendous success in other territories, led us to the decision to expand our reach in Texas.&quot; Customers also can help support the development of new solar facilities in Texas by signing up for the &quot;Big Texas Sun Club&quot; in addition to their standard electricity service. For $5 a month customers can help promote education about solar energy in Texas, as well as the construction of new solar facilities in the state. Currently plans are under way to build 100 kW of solar in Texas this year, Green Mountain Energy said.

<span id="hd">ECD Installs BIPV Array at SFO</span><br>
Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) recently announced that the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) has installed an array of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roofing panels to produce clean energy for the airport and its operations. The 20-kilowatt (kW) array is capable of supplying a portion of the power needed at one of the airport's support buildings. The system was designed and installed by Renewable Energy Resources (RER) using ECD's UNI-SOLAR photovoltaic (PV) laminates. The peel-and-stick PV laminates were bonded to metal roofing pans and installed in modular units. &quot;What the customer loves about this type of installation is they get maintenance-free clean energy integrated into a beautiful new roof,&quot; said RER president and CEO Tibor Fischl. &quot;Our extensive research into existing solar technology led us to rely on UNI-SOLAR products as the backbone of our design.&quot; RER said the SFO system is grid-connected. A utility inverter was installed that changes the direct current (DC) generated by the array into a usable alternating current (AC). RER commissioned ISE Research to design the software and monitoring systems for the array. The system displays the daily energy output, emissions offset and total dollars saved by the energy system on a large display for the SFO engineering staff.

<span id="hd">More Warming to Use of Geothermal Heating</span><br>
A geothermal heat pump may not be keeping most metro Atlantans' homes cozy on chilly spring nights, but the system -- which uses the constant temperature of the earth to keep a home or office at a comfortable level -- gradually is gaining awareness across the nation. Now, there's a key Georgia connection to the spread of this decades-old heating and cooling method. Stone Mountain-based Ameriplast Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial PlasTech Inc. of Toronto, has entered a contract as primary supplier to Water Furnace International, which makes and distributes geothermal systems for residential, commercial and institutional heating applications. The company did not release terms of the deal. Ameriplast, which cites AT&amp;T as one of its biggest customers, manufactures high density polyethylene conduit. Its applications range from telecom to cable TV to high speed Internet access to geothermal systems. Widespread usage Geothermal systems are in every one of the 48 contiguous states as well as other countries, said Marvin Smith, director of geothermal heat pump research in the division of engineering technology at Oklahoma State University. The piping system goes into a &quot;loop&quot; field outside in one of three ways: Horizontally, which requires using a backhoe; vertically, using a drill rig to go straight down into the ground; or via a lake or pond loop which goes into the water. The heat pump transfers energy from the ground source. &quot;That's the one thing that makes it efficient,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It comes from a renewable source.&quot; And that's not all. &quot;The beauty of it is, it never needs replacement,&quot; said Kevin Winch, president of Ameriplast. Builder Julius Poston, founder and president of Certified Living of Atlanta, has put geothermal systems in 50 to 60 homes and is installing one in a new home in Brookhaven. Many homeowners are transplants from the north and &quot;are more conscious about environmental issues,&quot; he said. Jack Tysor, founder of Anchor Heating in Douglasville, decided he couldn't sell geothermal to heat homes if someone at the company didn't have it in his home. So Tysor, who is semi-retired from the company, had the system installed in his home seven years ago. He said he hasn't regretted it. &quot;I came out of a house that had gas heat and I can't tell any difference between the geothermal and the gas,&quot; he said. His house is about 2,000 square feet and he has a three-ton geothermal system in place. He said his monthly bill has never gotten higher than $140, and during mild months, it dips as low as $60 or $70. Tysor's son Barry, who is vice president of the company, said Anchor Heating installs about 50 geothermal systems a year, most of them for custom-built homes where the homeowner wants the system. Only a small percentage is builder-driven, he said. Billy Wise, project developer with Southern Co. Energy Solutions, an arm of the utility, said one of the geothermal installations it is involved in is at the residential units of the Navy Supply Corps School in Athens.
</p>

<p>
Limited awareness Geothermal systems got attention a couple of years ago during the electricity crisis in California and when natural gas prices were high. But despite slowly increasing awareness of geothermal, there's still a lot of people who don't know about it in Georgia. &quot;Here in Georgia, it's still an education process,&quot; said Tom Niesse, territory manager covering Georgia and Florida for Water Furnace International. &quot;There's just a small cadre of people that even know about it,&quot; Wise said. In addition, there's also the price tag: Initial costs for a geothermal system are estimated at two to three times the cost of the traditional heating and cooling system. But people interested in the system should look at the life-cycle cost -- taking into consideration the initial investment, operation and maintenance costs over a period of years -- before making a decision, Smith said. The savings can make a difference. For example, some schools in his state that put in geothermal systems have been able to buy educational necessities with their savings, he said. Ameriplast provides a crucial component to Water Furnace. Many years ago, some of the first geothermal systems were first put in with PVC pipe, which has a lower thermal conductivity than high density polyethylene. &quot;That material has helped a great deal,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It has a tremendously long life. The method of putting it together is very, very reliable.&quot; Ameriplast added a few more employees to help handle the additional workload of the Water Furnace deal. It now has 53 employees. &quot;That's a lot for us,&quot; Winch said. <em>Source: Atlanta Business Chronicle 5/6/2002.</em>

<span id="hd">Assistant Secretary David Garman Speaks at Two Midwestern Conferences</span><br>
Assistant Secretary of EERE, David Garman, attended two regional conferences in early April, and spoke in support of biomass energy as an important way to enhance our nation's energy security. At an energy meeting in Sioux Falls, SD, held on April 5, discussion covered topics such as ethanol, biodiesel, wind and solar power, making plastics and fibers out of corn, and ways to conserve energy at home. At the second annual Wind Power and Bioenergy Conference, held in Oklahoma City, OK on April 11, tutorial sessions were held on various biomass topics, such as ethanol, rural biopower and biomass gasification.

Julee Herdt, an assistant professor of architecture at the University of Colorado at Denver, is building a 4,700-square-foot home almost completely made with bio-based, recycled, and Earth-friendly materials. Herdt used as many bio-based materials as possible to build the house, including sunflower plants and soy adhesives for the cabinets and wall panels, wheat straw for particle board, and pressed wastepaper for drywall. The house cost Herdt roughly $65 per square foot, or about $305,000, compared to the average sales price of $141 per square foot for a new production home in Boulder.

<span id="hd">Fuel-cell Developers vie With Each Other to Grab Golden Ring</span><br>
Fuel-cell developers put their own spin on who is first out of the gate. UTC Fuel Cells of Connecticut said it is the first supplier of a fuel cell for a U.S.-manned space mission and the only company producing commercially available fuel-cell systems. H Power Corp. of New Jersey said it believes it was first to complete a commercial sale of a proton-exchange membrane fuel-cell system. And Latham-based Plug Power Inc. said it provided the fuel cell for the first home to be powered by a proton-exchange membrane fuel-cell system running on natural gas. &quot;Right now you don't need to be a first mover. It's still in the really early stage of the game,&quot; said Eric Prouty, an analyst following energy technology companies with Boston-based Adams Harkness &amp; Hill investment research firm. &quot;If you're a deep-pocket company, you can sit back and see how things shake out and jump in later if fuel cells are shown to be a very large market.&quot; Prouty said he expected there will be a shakeout in the industry in the next five to 10 years.
</p>

<p>
According to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the fuel-cell sector is just becoming commercial. Fuel cells use an electrochemical process rather than combustion to convert hydrocarbons such as hydrogen or natural gas into electricity, heat and water. &quot;The first thing I always point out is there's room for all of us now,&quot; said Roger Saillant, Plug's president and CEO. &quot;There's a tremendous market out there. &quot;The whole industry should collaborate like hell for 10 or 15 years and then after that compete like crazy. Right now there's a lot going on and we should just help each other get the technology out there,&quot; continued Saillant, who said he was echoing the sentiments of George McNamee, co-CEO of First Albany Cos. Inc. and chairman of Plug. Here's a look at a few of Plug's direct competitors:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>UTC Fuel Cells, based in South Windsor, Conn., is developing fuel cells for commercial, transportation, residential and space applications. UTC, formerly known as International Fuel Cells, is a unit of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX).

	<p>
The company began producing its commercial product, the PC25 fuel-cell power plant, in 1991. Each unit produces 200 kilowatts of electricity and 900,000 British thermal units of heat. UTC has delivered more than 235 of the systems to customers in 19 countries on five continents. The company also is teaming with United Technology's Carrier Corp., which makes air conditioners; Toshiba Corp.; and Buderus Heiztechnik, a heating system manufacturer, to develop a 5-kw proton-exchange membrane fuel cell for homes and small commercial buildings. It currently has a prototype for the residential and light commercial markets named Energy Center, and expects to have that product out by 2003. In March, UTC said it was selling seven PC25 power plants to Verizon Communication's calling route center in Long Island. Last year, the company sold eight PC25 units to the New York Power Authority.
</p>
</li>


	<li>H Power Corp. (Nasdaq: HPOW), based in Clifton, N.J., was founded in 1989 and has developed, owns or has exclusive rights to what it called significant patents, proprietary technology and trade secrets covering fuel cells. Its fuel cells are designed to provide electricity for stationary, portable and mobile applications.<br><br></li>


	<li>H Power said it has completed the development of residential cogeneration units that provide between 3 kw and 4.5 kw of continuous power. The company also has developed smaller portable and mobile units that operate on hydrogen and can produce 15 watts to 500 watts of power for such devices as highway message signs and special electronic vehicles. The company's target market for the residential cogeneration units will be rural homes. In April, H Power signed an $81 million contract with ECO Fuel Cells LLC, a company created by Energy Co-Opportunity Inc., an association of more than 300 rural electric cooperatives serving more than 18 million domestic customers.<br><br></li>


	<li>Ballard Power Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: BLDP), based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, was founded in 1979 under the name Ballard Research Inc. to conduct research and development in lithium batteries. In 1983, the company began developing proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.</li>


	<p>
Beginning in 1992, it developed prototype systems to demonstrate the technology. It currently has pre-commercial prototypes and is working with partners to develop commercial products for mass markets. The company is developing, manufacturing and marketing a zero-emission fuel cell. Ballard is commercializing fuel-cell engines for transportation applications and fuel-cell systems for portable and stationary products. Its products range from 1 kw to 250 kw. Ballard has partnerships with DaimlerChrysler, Ford and other auto manufacturers. The company has released its first commercial fuel-cell product--Nexa power module--for portable power.</p></li>
