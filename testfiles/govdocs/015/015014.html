          CHATEAU MARMONT ACCOUNTANT PLEADS GUILTY TO EMBEZZLEMENT</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A former accountant 
          for the Chateau Marmont hotel has pleaded guilty to charges that he 
          embezzled over nearly $14 million from the hotel between 1996 and 2002, 
          U.S. Attorney Debra W. Yang has announced today.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Kelly Timothy Ebert, 
          39, of Westlake Village, who has been held without bond since his arrest 
          in March 2003, pleaded guilty before United States District Court Judge 
          William Matthew Byrne, Jr. Wednesday morning to two counts of wire fraud. 
          Ebert, who had a criminal record before he began working at the Chateau 
          Marmont, also pleaded guilty to illegally possessing a number of firearms.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At his change of 
          plea, Ebert admitted to stealing nearly $14 million dollars between 
          1996 and 2002 from an account at the Bank of Orange County in Fountain 
          Valley, California, into which the Chateau Marmont's credit card receipts 
          were deposited. Ebert was hired as the controller of the Chateau Marmont 
          in 1993, and admitted that he did not tell the persons who hired him 
          that he had been convicted in Colorado of forgery in 1987. While he 
          worked at the hotel, Ebert directed the money from the Chateau Marmont 
          to a business account he controlled in the name &quot;CD-Rom Travel 
          Planners,&quot; and admitted when pleading guilty that he falsified 
          the hotel's accounting records to conceal his theft. Ebert then moved 
          funds from the CD-Rom Travel Planners business account to his personal 
          account and other accounts he controlled. Under questioning from Judge 
          Byrne, Ebert admitted that he used the money, among other things, to 
          purchase and improve a $2.3 million home near the Lake Sherwood country 
          club, and to purchase jewelry and collectibles. Ebert was eventually 
          fired from the Chateau Marmont in March 2002. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ebert's sentencing 
          has been set for August 11, 2003, at which time he faces a maximum of 
          twenty years imprisonment. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This case was investigated 
          by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </font></p>
