<H3>Introduction   
</H3> 
<p>The Summitville gold mine, located at ~3800 meters (11,500 ft)
  elevation in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, was the
  focus of extensive public attention in 1992 and 1993 for environmental
  problems stemming from recent open-pit mining activities.  Summitville
  catalyzed national debates about the environmental effects of modern
  mining activities, and became the focus of arguments for proposed
  revisions to the 1872 Mining Law governing mining activities on public
  lands.  In early 1993, the State of Colorado, U.S. Environmental
  Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and
  Wildlife Service (USFWS), Colorado State University, San Luis Valley
  agencies, downstream water users, private companies, and individuals
  began a multi-disciplinary research program to provide needed scientific
  information on Summitville's environmental problems and downstream
  environmental effects. Detailed results of this multi-agency effort were
  presented, along with legal and policy issues, at the  Summitville Forum
  in January, 1995, at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.

<p>This paper provides a scientific
  perspective on Summitville based on USGS study results as of early 1995.
   Further information on USGS studies are available in a separate general
  interest publication 
    <A HREF="#King.1995a"> (King, 1995a)</A> .  The results demonstrate
  that earth science information is needed to develop more effective
  techniques for the prediction, assessment, mitigation, and remediation
  of the environmental effects of mining.<BR clear="left">

<H3>Background
</H3>   
<p class="textindent">Gold was first discovered at Summitville in 1870.  Significant
  gold production from underground workings occurred prior to 1900.  In
  1903, the </p>

<p><A HREF="adit.gif"><IMG SRC="aditikon.gif" ALT="Reynolds Adit; green drainage" align="left"
></A></p>
<p><A HREF="adit.gif"><strong>Reynolds adit</strong></A><strong> </strong>was driven to drain the underground workings and serve
  as an ore haulage tunnel.  Production occurred sporadically through the
  1950's.  The district received some exploration attention in the 1970's
  as a copper prospect, but no mining for copper was pursued.   
</p>
<P></P>  
<p class="textindent">Similar to many historic gold mining districts in the western
  United States, Summitville received renewed interest in the early 1980's
  due to technological advances that allow extraction of low-grade ores
  with cyanide heap leach techniques.  In 1984, Summitville Consolidated
  Mining Company, Inc. (SCMCI), initiated open pit mining of gold ore from
  rocks surrounding the historic underground workings, where gold
  concentrations had been too low to be economic for the underground
  mining operations.  Ore from the pit was crushed and placed on a heap
  leach pad overlying a protective liner.  Cyanide solutions were
  sprinkled onto the heap and trickled down through the crushed ore,
  dissolving the gold.  The processing solutions were then collected from
  the base of the heap leach pile, and the gold was chemically extracted
  from the solutions. <BR clear="left">

<H4><I>Summitville CO, Oct. 1993, Aerial photo by IntraSearch Inc.</I></H4>
 <P></P>  
 <p class="textindent">Environmental problems
  developed soon after the initiation of open-pit mining.  Acidic, metal
  rich drainage into the Wightman Fork of the Alamosa River increased
  significantly from numerous sources on site, including the  Reynolds
  adit and the Cropsy waste dump <A HREF="#Pendleton.1995">(Pendleton and
  others, 1995)</A> .  Cyanide-bearing processing solutions began leaking
  into an underdrain system beneath the heap leach pad, where they then
  mixed with acid ground waters from the Cropsy waste dump. Cyanide
  solutions also leaked from transfer pipes directly into the Wightman
  Fork several times over the course of mining. 
 </p>
 <P></P>  
 <p class="textindent">SCMCI had ceased active mining and had begun environmental
  remediation when it declared bankruptcy in December 1992 and abandoned
  the mine site.  The bankruptcy created several immediate concerns. 
  Earlier in 1992, the company had brought a water treatment plant on line
  to begin treating the estimated 150 to 200 million gallons of spent
  cyanide processing solutions remaining in the heap; however, treatment
  was proceeding so slowly relative to influx of snowmelt waters that the
  waters were in danger of overtopping a containment dike and flowing
  directly into the Wightman Fork.  In addition, piping carrying the
  processing solutions to the treatment plant would have frozen within
  several hours, releasing cyanide solutions and stopping water treatment.
  
 </p>
 <P></P>  
 <p class="textindent">At the request of the State of Colorado, the U.S.
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) immediately took over the site
  under EPA Superfund Emergency Response authority and increased treatment
  of the heap leach solutions, thereby averting a catastrophic release of
  cyanide solutions from the heap. Summitville was added to the EPA
  National Priorities List in late May, 1994.  Ongoing remediation efforts
  include decommissioning of the heap leach pad, plugging of the Reynolds
  and Chandler adits,backfilling of the open pit with acid-generating mine
  waste material, and capping of the backfilled pit to prevent water
  inflow.   The total cost of the cleanup has been estimated to be from US
  $100 million to $120 million. 
 </p>
 <P></P> 
 <p class="textindent"><BR>  
   The environmental problems at Summitville have been of
  particular concern due to the extensive downstream use of Alamosa River
  water for livestock, agricultural irrigation, and wildlife habitat.
  Increased acid and metal loadings from Summitville are suspected to have
  caused the 1990 disappearance of stocked fish from Terrace Reservoir and
  farm holding ponds along the Alamosa River (Colo. Div. of Wildlife, oral
  comm., 1993).  The Alamosa River is used extensively to irrigate crops
  in the southwestern San Luis Valley.  Important crops include alfalfa
  (used for livestock feed), barley (used in beer production), wheat, and
  potatoes; there has been concern about potential adverse effects of the
  increased acid and metal loadings from Summitville on the metal content
  and viability of these crops.  The Alamosa River also feeds wetlands
  that are habitat for aquatic life and migratory water fowl such as ducks
  and the endangered whooping crane; there are concerns about
  Summitville's effects on these wetlands and their associated wildlife.</p>

<H3>Summitville Mine Site</H3> 
<p class="textindent">USGS efforts at the Summitville site
  since open pit mining began include detailed geologic mapping in the
  open pit <A HREF="#Gray.1994a">(Gray and Coolbaugh, 1994a)</A>,
  characterization of the site's environmental geology and geochemistry
  <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995a">(Plumlee and others, 1995 a and b),</A>
  studies of cyanide degradation <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995b">(Plumlee and
  others, 1995b)</A>, and geophysical resistivity surveys <A HREF="#Bisdorf.1995"
>(Bisdorf, 1995)</A>. 
</p>
<P></P>
<p class="textindent">The Summitville mine drainage waters are among the most acidic
  and metal-rich in Colorado <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995b">(Plumlee and
  others, 1995b)</A>, with pH generally below 3 and high to extreme
  concentrations of iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, and other
  metals. The acidic, metal-rich nature of the waters is a predictable
  consequence of the deposit's geologic and geochemical characteristics
  <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995a">(Plumlee and others, 1995 a;</A><A HREF="#Gray.1994b"
> Gray and others, 1994b).</A>  Prior to mineralization, the volcanic
  dome rocks that host the deposit were intensely altered by highly acidic
  volcanic gas condensates.  Sulfide-rich mineral assemblages containing
  pyrite, enargite, chalcopyrite, and other minerals were subsequently
  deposited in the altered host rocks by hydrothermal fluids.  Open-pit
  mining exposed large volumes of previously unoxidized sulfides to
  weathering.  Acid-mine drainage with high concentrations of metals forms
  by the reactions of these previously unoxidized sulfides with oxygenated
  groundwaters.  Further, the highly altered host rocks have very little
  capacity to react with and consume the acid generated by sulfide
  oxidation, thereby providing little or no mitigation of the acid
  drainage.  Evaporation further increases the concentrations of acid and
  metals in waters draining mine dumps and open-pit waters.  Soluble salts
  such as chalcanthite (a copper sulfate), jarosite (a potassium-iron
  sulfate), and halotrichite (an iron-aluminum sulfate) form by the
  extreme evaporation of acid waters during dry periods; dissolution of
  these salts during snowmelt or summer storm events leads to the
  transient release of even more acidic and metal-rich water pulses from
  the site <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995a">(Plumlee and others, 1995 a and b)</A>.

<p><A HREF="ph2oimag.gif"><strong>Acidic metal-rich puddles in the
  Summitville open pit</strong></A><strong> formed by dissolved secondary salts in rainwater.</strong></p>
<P></P>
<p class="textindent">The backfilling and capping of the open
  pit will help reduce acid drainage from Summitville by reducing water-
  and snow-catchment and by decreasing the amounts of exposed sulfides and
  soluble salts.  However, some level of acid discharge will likely
  continue from the site.  Significant volumes of unweathered sulfides and
  soluble salts are dispersed throughout the site on roadways, in soils,
  and in other surficial materials.  These solids are a long-term source
  of metals and acid that will be difficult to remediate.  In May, 1994,
  four months after the Reynolds adit was plugged, a plug on the Chandler
  adit (located 150 feet above and 2400 feet north of the Reynolds adit)
  failed and began leaking acidic, metal-rich waters into the Wightman
  Fork.  Although the Chandler is currently being re-plugged, the leak
  underscores the fact that it is difficult to prevent leakage of
  groundwaters from a highly fractured and mined mountain.  The plugging
  of the Reynolds adit also resulted in the predictable reactivation of
  acid seeps and springs that had drained the site prior to underground
  mining; these natural seeps had left behind extensive, mappable deposits
  of brown iron hydroxide minerals<A HREF="#Plumlee.1995b">(Plumlee and
  others, 1995b)</A>. Long-term leakage of acid groundwaters from these
  natural discharge points is unavoidable.</p>
<P></P> 
<p class="textindent">USGS studies show that
  the severe acid drainage problems at Summitville may have actually
  helped mitigate the effects of accidental cyanide releases.  Experiments
  in which Summitville heap leach solutions were mixed with acid-drainage
  waters from the site indicate that metal-cyanide complexes in the heap
  leach solutions react readily with acid in the drainage waters to form
  hydrogen cyanide, which then volatilizes into the atmosphere <A HREF="#Plumlee.1995b"
>(Plumlee and others, 1995b)</A>. </p>

<p><A HREF="cyanide.gif"><strong>Plot of cyanide concentration vs. time</strong></A><strong> in
  heap leach effluents reacting with acid mine drainage. </strong></p>
<P></P> 
<p class="textindent">In addition,
  copper cyanide in the heap leach solutions reacts with iron from the
  drainage waters to form solid copper-iron cyanide compounds, which are
  then degraded through reactions catalyzed by sunlight.  Thus, most
  cyanide species that were accidentally leaked into the Wightman Fork
  (Fig. 2) probably degraded rather rapidly due to mixing with the site's
  acid drainage, especially if the leaks occurred on sunny summer days
  optimal for maximum cyanide volatilization and photolytic degradation. 
  However, if leaks occurred in the winter, cyanide may have persisted
  considerably farther downstream due to reduced rates of volatilization. 
  Relatively high concentrations of thiocyanate may have persisted
  downstream due to its stability in acidic solutions.<BR clear="left">

<H3><B>Effects on the Alamosa River</B></H3>    
<p class="textindent">Increased acid and
  metal loadings from Summitville are suspected to have caused the 1990
  disappearance of stocked fish from Terrace Reservoir and farm holding
  ponds downstream on the Alamosa River (Colo. Div. of Wildlife, oral
  comm., 1993).  However, significant  natural contamination also enters
  the Alamosa from  unmined or minimally  mined   mineralized areas

<p class="textindent">Geologic studies <A HREF="#Bove.1995">(Bove and others, 1995)</A>
  of the mineralized areas south of Summitville have shown that
  hydrothermally-altered  and sulfide-mineralized rocks are the source for
  numerous acid springs and seeps.  In addition, physical erosion rates
  greatly exceed chemical weathering rates in the most highly altered
  areas.  In these areas, unoxidized sulfides are exposed at the ground
  surface and are transported as sediments into the Alamosa River, where
  they serve as further sources for acid and metals.<BR clear="left">

<p class="textindent">A regional geochemical survey of the San Luis

  southwestern San Luis valley contain anomalous concentrations of copper
  and other metals
    <A HREF="#Tidball.1995">(Tidball and others, 1995 in press)</A>. These
  metal anomalies largely reflect the pre-mining erosion of mineralized
  areas in the Alamosa River basin.  Effects of irrigation with Alamosa

  the effects of the mineralized source material for the soils <A HREF="#Erdman.1993"

<p class="textindent">Studies of San Luis valley irrigation waters taken from the
  Alamosa River show that degraded water quality can persist more than 60
  km downstream from Summitville <A HREF="#Smith.1995">(Smith and others,
  1995)</A>.  This results from (1) natural acid and metal contamination
  from other mineralized areas; (2) the lack of large diluting tributaries
  to the Alamosa River, and; (3) the lack of acid-buffering capacity of
  the volcanic rocks through which the Alamosa River and tributaries flow

<p class="textindent">There has been considerable concern about crops irrigated with
  Alamosa River water. Dominant crops include barley (used in the beer
  brewing industry) and alfalfa (used as livestock feed).  Results of 1993
  USGS studies show that irrigation with Alamosa River waters led to
  slightly increased concentrations of copper and other metals in the
  alfalfa and barley relative to levels of these metals in alfalfa and

  successful using this technique.  Ongoing studies are investigating
  whether mapped crop stress levels can be correlated with source of
  irrigation water. 
</p>
<P></P> 
<p class="textindent">Studies of wetlands in the San Luis Valley show that
  concentrations of copper and zinc in sediments and plants are greater in
  wetlands receiving Alamosa River water than in a wetland fed by water
  from other sources; this indicates that some copper from Summitville and
  zinc from Summitville and other sources are reaching the wetlands 
    <A HREF="#Balistrieri.1995">(Balistrieri and others, 1995 in press)</A>.
   However, the Alamosa River-fed wetland waters have basic pH values and
  very low metal concentrations.  Impacts on aquatic life and waterfowl
  are currently under evaluation. 
</p>
<P></P>
<p class="textindent">Tree-ring chemistry was also evaluated to help assess impacts of
  Summitville on plant ecosystems <A HREF="#Gough.1995">(Gough and
  others, 1995 in press)</A>: the metal content of sequential tree rings,
  spanning 30 years of growth, was measured in cottonwoods and aspens
  along the Alamosa River from the Wightman Fork downstream into the San
  Luis Valley.  Results for Cu and Zn show no clear effects from
  Summitville, and the limited number of analyses completed to date
  preclude a detailed interpretation of the results <A HREF="#Gough.1995">(Gough
  and others, 1995 in press)</A>.  
</p>
<P></P> <H3><B>Summary</B></H3>    
<p class="textindent">Although final scientific
  judgments about Summitville and its environmental effects await the
  outcome of ongoing research, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn:
  (1) Extreme acid rock drainage, rather than cyanide releases, is the
  dominant long-term environmental concern at Summitville.  Extensive
  remedial efforts will be required to minimize weathering and dissolution
  of unweathered sulfides and soluble metal salts.  Some level of
  long-term acid- and metal-release into the Wightman Fork will likely
  occur in spite of the remedial efforts, however, due to leakage from
  natural discharge points and the wide distribution of acid-generating
  material throughout the site. (2) It is likely that natural
  contamination adversely affected water quality and fish habitat in the
  Alamosa River prior to mining, and will continue to have adverse effects
  even when acid drainage from Summitville is remediated. Thus, realistic
  geochemical baselines for the Alamosa River basin must be defined in
  order to set realistic remediation standards for the Summitville site.
  (3) As of late 1993, Summitville apparently had no discernible
  short-term adverse effects on the barley or alfalfa crops irrigated with
  Alamosa River water.  However, increases in metal content of irrigation
  waters and alfalfa measured in the summer of 1994 underscore the need
  for prompt and effective remediation at the site to ensure that no
  adverse effects develop over the longer term.
</p>
<P></P> 
<p class="textindent">Results of Summitville research to date underscore the crucial
  need for geoscientific information in predicting, assessing, and
  remediating the environmental effects of mining.  For example,
  Summitville shows how geologic and geochemical information should be
  used in the future to more effectively anticipate and mitigate potential
  environmental effects of metal mining.  Similarly, a careful
  consideration of Summitville's geologic and geochemical characteristics
  (and their controls on hydrology and acid-drainage formation) is needed
  to help refine and anticipate the effectiveness of remedial measures at
  the site.  In the assessment of Summitville's downstream environmental
  effects, geoscience studies contribute much by: (1) providing a
  scientific evaluation of the actual, rather than perceived,
  environmental problems and their effects; (2) showing that natural
  environmental effects of other mineralized areas must also be
  considered, and; (3) showing that Summitville's effects on aquatic life,
  agriculture, and wetlands ecosystems can best be understood only when
  examined in an integrated geologic, geochemical, and biological context.</p>
