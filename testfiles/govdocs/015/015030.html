In this  trademark case  a                       _____________________<br><br>          French  wine grower and merchant seeks to modify a consent decree<br><br>          that bars him from using his family name  in his wine importation<br><br>          business because  of possible confusion with  products offered by<br><br>          the  current  owner  of his  late  father's  company.   After  an<br><br>          evidentiary   hearing,   the    district   court   accepted   the<br><br>          recommendation  of   the  magistrate  judge  that  the  requested<br><br>          modification  be denied.  The appeal requires us to consider both<br><br>          the  appropriate standard  and the  district court's  exercise of<br><br>          discretion in applying that standard.  We affirm.<br><br>                                 History of the Case                                 ___________________<br><br>               In 1946 Alexis Lichine began to import French wines into the<br><br>          United States.   In 1951 he purchased Chateau Prieure-Cantenac, a<br><br>          wine-growing  chateau  in  the Haut-Medoc  region  near Bordeaux,<br><br>          which  he renamed  Chateau  Prieure-Lichine (CPL).    In 1955  he<br><br>          founded  his  own wine-trading  company,  Alexis  Lichine &  Cie.<br><br>          (ALC),  and in 1964 ALC registered "Alexis Lichine" with the U.S.<br><br>          Patent Office.  Shortly thereafter, in October 1964, Lichine sold<br><br>          ALC  and  its  mark   to  a  company  affiliated  with   a  major<br><br>          organization  in  the  wine  industry,  Bass  Charrington.    Not<br><br>          involved in  the sale was  CPL or its  mark, which also  had been<br><br>          registered in the U.S. Patent Office in July 1964.1<br><br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               1  ALC  was a  "negociant," an enterprise  that chooses  and<br>          buys wines from  producers, and  then stores,  ages, bottles  and<br>          sells  them under  its own trademark.   A  chateau, on  the other<br>          hand, is  restricted  to  selling  only  wines  produced  on  its<br>          premises.<br><br>                                         -2-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               In  the early  1980s,  Alexis's  son  started his  own  wine<br><br>          brokerage company, Sacha A. Lichine Estates Selections, and began<br><br>          importing wines into the United States.  Predictably, ALC brought<br><br>          a trademark infringement suit.  The court granted partial summary<br><br>          judgment  for ALC, concluding  that the  similarity of  names was<br><br>          such as to render confusion among customers likely.<br><br>               In 1986, a  consent decree was  issued enjoining Sacha  from<br><br>          using  the words  Alexis  Lichine "or  any colorable  imitation,"<br><br>          including  Sacha  A.  Lichine,   S.A.  Lichine,  or  Lichine,  in<br><br>          connection with the sale  of any alcoholic beverage.   ALC waived<br><br>          several  causes  of action,  as well  as  claims for  damages and<br><br>          profits.   Both parties assumed  their own  costs and  attorney's<br><br>          fees, and waived appeal.<br><br>               In 1987,  Sacha,  who had  been estranged  from his  father,<br><br>          returned  to CPL.  Alexis  was by this  time widely recognized in<br><br>          the wine industry and  had written authoritative books  on French<br><br>          wines, as well  as his famous "Alexis Lichine's  New Encyclopedia<br><br>          of Wines and Spirits."   When Alexis died two years  later, Sacha<br><br>          inherited the chateau.  <br><br>               In early  1990, the Bass  Charrington interests sold  ALC to<br><br>          another giant, Pernod Ricard (Pernod).   ALC is now one of  three<br><br>          entities  managed by  a Pernod  subsidiary, Crus  et  Domaines de<br><br>          France.   Meanwhile, as shall  be detailed later,  Sacha had been<br><br>          improving  both the operations of CPL and his own reputation, and<br><br>          wanted  to expand his imports  into the United  States beyond the<br><br>          10,000 or 11,000 cases of his own chateau's wine.  In August 1991<br><br><br>                                         -3-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          he  requested relief from the  burdens of the  injunction, and in<br><br>          April 1992 was allowed to seek modification under Fed. R. Civ. P.<br><br>          60(b)(5).<br><br>                                  Proceedings Below                                  _________________<br><br>                  Appellant urged three reasons to modify the injunction to<br><br>          permit  him to use his name  on certain bottles of imported wine:<br><br>          the death of Alexis  Lichine and his inheritance of  his father's<br><br>          shares in  CPL; the decline in  the quality of wines  sold by ALC<br><br>          and in ALC's  reputation; and the improvements  in CPL's capacity<br><br>          and product and the rise in Sacha's own reputation.  He sought to<br><br>          demonstrate  that a  Sacha  Lichine wine  label  no longer  would<br><br>          infringe  on the  trademark  derived from  his father's  name and<br><br>          that, in fact, his  own name was now  of greater significance  in<br><br>          the wine world than ALC's.<br><br>               ALC, on the  other hand,  contended that there  had been  no<br><br>          unanticipated change of circumstances  since the injunction, that<br><br>          its reputation continued  to be  high, that its  reliance on  the<br><br>          exclusive right to use  of the Lichine name and  reputation still<br><br>          was strong, and that Sacha was  suffering no hardship and was not<br><br>          prohibited from  merchandising wines  in the United  States under<br><br>          other names.<br><br>               Appellant  presented evidence  during the  four day  hearing<br><br>          showing that he had invested  some $3,000,000 on improvements  to<br><br>          his chateau.   He added a new wine cellar,  a visitors' center, a<br><br>          sales  shop and  a helicopter  pad, and  also improved  the sales<br><br>          force, physical plant  and vineyards.   The harvest  of 1989  was<br><br><br>                                         -4-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          rated  as  particularly good.    Appellant also  had  exhibited a<br><br>          promotional  flair, had  been featured  in a  number of  magazine<br><br>          articles, had participated in  prestigious fetes and cruises, and<br><br>          now  enjoyed a reputation in the wine industry independent of his<br><br>          father's.   In contrast, appellant's  witnesses testified,  ALC's<br><br>          wines  had  sunk  in   recent  years  to  lesser  quality,   "vin<br><br>          d'ordinaire" status.  Moreover, ALC's sales  in the United States<br><br>          had declined  by some 50  percent between  1991 and 1993,  a much<br><br>          greater decline  than had affected  the general market  of French<br><br>          wine imports.<br><br>               ALC's evidence was  to the effect that  Pernod Ricard, world<br><br>          leader  in the  aperitif field  and owner  of some  50 companies,<br><br>          bought  ALC in 1990 before it was  aware of appellant's effort to<br><br>          modify  the injunction.    The purchase  was  part of  its  "main<br><br>          thrust" in  acquisitions to  increase its  presence  in the  wine<br><br>          industry.  Pernod  officials testified to  a current strategy  to<br><br>          "reconcentrate" on better wines and considered ALC to be basic to<br><br>          that strategy.<br><br>               As  early   as  1990,  an  ALC  official   in  Bordeaux  had<br><br>          recommended that table wine  should be "progressively erased from<br><br>          the entire ALC's  line" and that "A. LICHINE should return to its<br><br>          original concept initiated by ALEXIS."  A subsequent higher level<br><br>          recommendation  was  made  by  the vice  president  in  charge of<br><br>          marketing and  sales for Austin Nichols, the company charged with<br><br>          carrying  out the marketing plan involving ALC.  He described his<br><br>          recommended objective as effecting "a defined segmentation"  with<br><br><br>                                         -5-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          one entity (Cruse) representing  "the most popular-priced volume-<br><br>          oriented  table  wines"  and   Alexis  Lichine  representing  the<br><br>          "exclusive chateaus that we would have offered to us." <br><br>               This recommendation, he further testified, was  accepted and<br><br>          reflected in  a  document entitled  "Alexis Lichine  -- Cruse  --<br><br>          1993."  Under "Strategy" were these comments:<br><br>               Reposition Alexis Lichine to a portfolio of mid to high<br>               prices [sic] wines.<br><br>               Reposition  Cruse to  include  mainly low  priced table<br>               wines and  mid-priced varietals with a  limited line of<br>               Petits Chateaux.<br><br>               Notwithstanding  these  resolves,  Pernod  first  needed  to<br><br>          dispose  of  its existing  inventories  of wines  in  a declining<br><br>          market.  As a result,  little headway had been made with  the new<br><br>          strategy at  the time  of the  hearing on  Sacha's request  for a<br><br>          modification.   Certain  steps had been  taken, however.   Higher<br><br>          priced  wines were  being  marketed, promotional  literature  was<br><br>          being  pushed, wine  writers  were being  wooed,  ALC wines  were<br><br>          reaching  a  considerable  number   of  restaurant  wine   lists,<br><br>          participation in  important wine promotions had  taken place, and<br><br>          entry into the airline market was underway.<br><br>               The  magistrate  judge found  that ALC  had invested  in ALC<br><br>          wines,  though not  in large  amounts; that  the company  had not<br><br>          abandoned the mark, and indeed was dealing in wine "not devoid of<br><br>          quality";  that, nevertheless,  there had been a decline  in both<br><br>          quality and quantity of ALC wine  sold in the United States since<br><br>          1986; and  that Sacha Lichine now was  a well respected figure in<br><br>          the wine industry, known for producing high quality wine.<br><br>                                         -6-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               On  the  legal  standard,   however,  the  magistrate  judge<br><br>          specifically refused  to apply  the "more flexible"  approach for<br><br>          evaluating   requests   to  modify   consent  decrees   that  was<br><br>          articulated in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 112 S. Ct.                         ____    ______________________________<br><br>          748,  758 (1992), and  instead adhered to  the sterner ("grievous<br><br>          wrong")  standard of United States v.  Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106,                               _____________     ___________<br><br>          119 (1932).   Emphasizing the private  commercial nature of  this<br><br>          litigation, the weight to  be given the interest in  the finality<br><br>          of  decrees, and the lack  of extreme hardship  to appellant, she<br><br>          concluded  that  there was  insufficient  basis  to dilute  ALC's<br><br>          property rights in the Alexis Lichine name.<br><br>               The  district court,  in  reviewing the  magistrate  judge's<br><br>          report, faced two issues.   The first concerned the  testimony of<br><br>          an appellant's witness, one Aaron, who had testified that the use<br><br>          of a personal name  was not significant for retail  merchants but<br><br>          would  be  "very important"  for Sacha  Lichine.   The magistrate<br><br>          judge  mistakenly understood  the testimony  to be  the converse.<br><br>          The  court  observed  that the  fact  that  the  family name  was<br><br>          important to appellant nevertheless did not warrant  modification<br><br>          of  the injunction.    We  might  also  observe  that  there  was<br><br>          testimony  from   the  same  witness   and  two  others   that  a<br><br>          considerable number of "negociants" did business under other than<br><br>          personal or family names.<br><br>               The more important ruling by the district court was directed<br><br>          to the  issue of the appropriate  standard governing modification<br><br>          of decrees.  The court said:<br><br><br>                                         -7-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    Even   assuming  that  Rufo  has  liberalized  the                                           ____<br>               standards for the modification  of decrees as argued by<br>               the defendant, there is still  a valid public policy in<br>               favor of the  finality of dispute  resolutions.  In  my<br>               opinion,  the  defendant  has  not  offered  sufficient<br>               reason to overturn that policy.<br><br><br><br>                                     Discussion                                      __________<br><br>               Standard  governing  modification.   We  first  consider the               _________________________________<br><br>          issue  of   the   appropriate  standard   of   review   governing<br><br>          modification of  injunctions.  Rule 60(b)(5)  provides for relief<br><br>          from a judgment when "it is no longer equitable that the judgment<br><br>          should have prospective application."  In Swift, which dealt with                                                    _____<br><br>          a  request  from  meat-packers   convicted  of  manipulating  the<br><br>          industry to  soften an  injunction's proscriptions  against them,<br><br>          the  Supreme Court  stated that  a party  seeking release  from a<br><br>          consent decree must offer proof of "hardship so extreme .  . . as<br><br>          to justify . . . saying that they are the victims of oppression,"<br><br>          or,  in  other words,  the party  must make  "a clear  showing of<br><br>          grievous wrong."

It stated<br><br>          that  Rule  60(b)(5) "permits  a  less  stringent, more  flexible<br><br>          standard."   Rufo, 112  S. Ct.  at 758.   While  Rufo was a  case                       ____                                ____<br><br>          involving institutional  reform,  we  do  not read  it  as  being<br><br>          confined in principle  to such cases.  In our view, Rule 60(b)(5)<br><br>                                         -8-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          sets forth the  umbrella concept of  "equitable" that both  Swift                                                                      _____<br><br>          and Rufo apply to particular, widely disparate fact situations.              ____<br><br>               Indeed, the Rufo Court quoted the basic distinction drawn in                           ____<br><br>          Swift between decrees protecting "rights fully accrued upon facts          _____<br><br>          so nearly permanent as to be substantially  impervious to change"<br><br>          and  decrees involving  "the supervision  of changing  conduct or<br><br>          conditions and are thus  provisional and tentative."  Id.  at 758                                                                __<br><br>          (quoting  from 286 U.S. at 114-15).

We view this not as  a limited dualism but              ____<br><br>          as polar  opposites of  a continuum in  which we must  locate the<br><br>          instant case.<br><br>               We therefore agree with  cases like In re Hendrix,  986 F.2d                                                   _____________<br><br>          195, 198 (7th Cir. 1993), viewing Rufo's flexible standard as "no                                            ______<br><br>          less suitable  to  other types  of equitable  case[s]," but  also<br><br>          share  the concerns voiced in  cases like W.L.

Cir. 1992), about the          _______________<br><br>          importance of finality  when a  decree is based  on a  negotiated<br><br>          bargain  in a  commercial case  between private  parties.   Thus,<br><br>          rather than saying either that there is an "institutional reform"<br><br>          exception to Swift  or a "private commercial  party" exception to                       _____<br><br>          Rufo, we apply Rule 60(b)(5) having  in mind that we are  dealing          ____<br><br>          with a decree  arising from a commercial  dispute and based on  a<br><br>          bargain voluntarily  entered into  by businessmen  represented by<br><br>          lawyers.<br><br>               Such  a  decree is  shielded from  facile modification  by a<br><br>          rather formidable carapace.  The public interest noted in Rufo is                                                                    ____<br><br><br>                                         -9-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          not  a factor, see 112 S. Ct.  at 758-59, other than the interest                         ___<br><br>          of the public in general and the business community in particular<br><br>          in the stability of final agreements.  Nor  is it persuasive that<br><br>          "it  is no longer convenient to live  with the terms of a consent<br><br>          decree."  Id. at 760.  Therefore, in considering whether a decree                    __<br><br>          arising out of commercial  litigation between two private parties<br><br>          should be modified,2 a court  should look to such factors  as the<br><br>          circumstances  leading to the  decree (including the  nature of a<br><br>          party's  initial  wrongdoing), the  quantum  of  hardship on  the<br><br>          burdened  party,  the duration  of the  burden  thus far  and the<br><br>          prospect of its continuing, and the benefitted party's need for a<br><br>          continuation of  the decree.   Such inquiries, however,  must not<br><br>          cast  a  judge in  the  role  of umpire  in  a  contest over  the<br><br>          performance or popularity of companies.<br><br>               Of course, in reviewing  the actions of the trial  court, we<br><br>          may reverse only for error of law or abuse of discretion.

This  was<br><br>          followed by a lawsuit and a solemn consent decree, this also  for<br><br>          the substantial  consideration of  waiver of claims  for damages,<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               2 Arguably,  a different approach might  be appropriate when<br>          such cases involve issues more laden with a public interest, such<br>          as antitrust.<br><br>                                         -10-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          profits, costs, and  attorney's fees.   A fairly  short time  has<br><br>          transpired  since the  decree,  and an  even  shorter time  since<br><br>          Pernod acquired ALC.  And although Pernod and its subsidiary have<br><br>          made little  progress in  rebuilding the  fortunes of ALC,  there<br><br>          have been the obstacles of outside economic forces as well as the<br><br>          dead weight of existing  inventory.  We cannot say  that Pernod's<br><br>          incipient strategy for ALC is a fabrication or without substance.<br><br>          Finally,  appellant  cannot  be  said  to  be  suffering  to  any<br><br>          unconscionable degree.<br><br>               Reading the transcripts of the several days of testimony, we<br><br>          found ourselves in an  unreal world.  This seemed to  have turned<br><br>          into a  trial  of  the  efficacy of  ALC's  business  operations.<br><br>          Appellant could  tweak the  tail of  the lion  and boast his  own<br><br>          accomplishments.   Much  time was  spent  on sales  figures,  the<br><br>          amount spent  on promotion, the  number of people  hired, ratings<br><br>          and  image.  One was tempted to feel  that the issue was: who had<br><br>          done the  best job in  promoting oneself and  one's wines  in the<br><br>          past several years?      But that is not  the question.  Unlike a<br><br>          sporting event, the parties do not have the same starting points.<br><br>          The trademark  holder and his  decree occupy a  favored position.<br><br>          The  challenger  faces  a  considerable task  in  establishing  a<br><br>          balance of equities favoring him.<br><br>               There is  an understandable  paucity of cases  involving the<br><br>          modification of  consent decrees  entered into by  two commercial<br><br>          parties.    We have  found one,  Tetra  Sales (U.S.A.)  v. T.F.H.                                           _____________________     ______<br><br>          Publications,  Inc.,  727  F.

Although the court's decision  was issued<br><br>          before Rufo, it was required  to adhere to the teaching of  Judge                 ____<br><br>          Friendly's opinion in New York State Ass'n for Retarded Children,                                ___________________________________________<br><br>          Inc.  v.

Ct. at 758-59 & n.6.            ____   ___<br><br>               In   Tetra  Sales,   the  court   declined  to   follow  the                    ____________<br><br>          recommendation  of a magistrate that a consent decree be modified<br><br>          to allow  a publisher  to  adopt a  format for  book covers  that<br><br>          differed from that  required by the decree.   The court  noted an<br><br>          earlier  trademark  case,  King-Seeley  Thermos  Co.  v.

A  two year period<br><br>          since the  decree was held "not  such a long period  of time that<br><br>          the Court should rush to make changes in the carefully negotiated<br><br>          agreement  between the parties."  727 F.  Supp. at 96.  The court<br><br>          further noted the presence of contested evidence and the need for<br><br>          rigid  restrictions to  "bring  some peace  to  a highly  charged<br><br>          situation,"  id. at  97, and  held that  defendant had  failed to                       ___<br><br>          carry its considerable burden.<br><br>               We feel similarly about this case.<br><br>               We  conclude by noting  briefly appellant's  contention that<br><br>          the  district  court did  not  balance  ALC's trademark  interest<br><br><br>                                         -12-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          against his interest in using his own name.

Taylor Wine  Co. v.                                                        ________________<br><br>          Bully  Hill Vineyards, Inc., 590 F.2d 701, 703-04 (2d Cir. 1978),          ___________________________<br><br>          wound  up approving  a  very restrictive  injunction, which  also<br><br>          embodied  a  disclaimer.   The  same  court,  more recently,  has<br><br>          evidenced deep skepticism  of the utility of  disclaimers and, in<br><br>          any event, would  require empirical evidence demonstrating  their<br><br>          effectiveness  in  avoiding  confusion.

The only  "balancing"<br><br>          suggested was a request that appellant  be allowed to use his own<br><br>          full name in a different  label format.  In light of  the not-so-<br><br>          old decree, which found that the use of the Lichine name would be<br><br>          likely to cause confusion, we see no abusive lack of balancing on<br><br>          the part of the court.<br><br>               In sum, at this time, on this record, we cannot say that the<br><br>          district court abused its discretion.<br><br>               AFFIRMED.               ________<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         -13-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
