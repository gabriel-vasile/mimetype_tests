Dear U.S.  TTB,

Why is it that I have been told by experts to read the labels on everything I consume, but you don't allow those facts on the alcohol beverages I drink? I am writing to you today to urge you to allow alcohol beverage companies to include this information on their products' packaging. 

Putting Serving Facts labels on alcoholic beverages will enable me as a consumer to make more informed and responsible decisions about drinking. 

Consumers want the TTB to take action on this matter. Please, do your job and allow alcohol beverage companies to put nutritional information on their containers. 

Thank you very much for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Danielle Kelly
