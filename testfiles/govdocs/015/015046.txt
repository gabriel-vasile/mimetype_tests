 NOTICE  OF  APPARENT  LIABILITY  FOR  FORFEITURE 
 Adopted:  May  6,  2003  Released:  May  12,  2003 
 By  the  Commission:  Chairman  Powell  issuing  a  separate  statement. 
 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  this  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for  Forfeiture  (“  NAL”),  we  find  that  Western  Wireless  Corporation  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  WWC  Holding  Co.,  Inc.  (“  WWC”),  cellular  radio 
 licensee  in  CMA583  North  Dakota  4  –  McKenzie  RSA  (collectively  “Western”),  apparently  willfully  and  repeatedly  violated  Section  301  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (“  Act”),  1  by  operating 
 radio  transmitting  equipment  from  an  unauthorized  location  in  Medora,  North  Dakota  (“  Medora  Site”  or  “Medora  Tower”).  Specifically,  Western  unlawfully  constructed  and  continues  to  operate  a  facility  that 
 has  a  significant  environmental  effect  without  obtaining  Commission  authorization  following  preparation  of  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (“  EIS”).  2  We  conclude,  pursuant  to  Section  503(  b)  of  the  Act,  that 
 Western  is  apparently  liable  for  a  forfeiture  in  the  amount  of  two  hundred  thousand  dollars  ($  200,000).  3 
 2.  Western’s  unlawful  operation  here  stems  from  its  failure  to  comply  with  the  Commission’s  environmental  rules.  Continued  unlawful  operation  may  result  in  additional  enforcement 


 action,  e.  g.,  increased  forfeitures,  initiation  of  a  license  revocation  proceeding,  or  both.  In  this  regard,  we  order  Western  to  provide  a  sworn  statement  within  30  days  regarding  its  plan  to  cease  operation  from  the 
 Medora  Site  or  bring  that  site  into  compliance  with  our  environmental  rules.  We  also  remind  Western  of  its  obligation  to  file  an  Environmental  Assessment  (“  EA”)  if  any  of  its  actions  in  response  to  this  NAL  or 
 subsequent  orders  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  environment. 
 II.  BACKGROUND 


 3.  Under  the  Commission’s  rules  implementing  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended,  (“  NEPA”),  4  licensees  are  required  to  assess  proposed  facilities  to  determine  whether 
 the  facilities  may  significantly  affect  the  environment  as  defined  in  Section  1.1307  of  the  Commission’s 


 1  47  U.  S.  C.  §  301. 
 2  See  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.  1305.

 Rules  (“  Rules”).  5  The  rules  provide  that  licensees  must  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Commission  an  EA  for  an  action  that  may  have  a  significant  environmental  effect.  6  This  includes  actions  for  which  no  pre-construction 
 authorization  is  otherwise  required.  7  In  light  of  the  Commission’s  obligations  under  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966,  as  amended  (“  NHPA”),  8  Section  1.1307(  a)(  4)  of  the  Rules 
 requires  that  a  licensee  must  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Commission  an  EA  if  a  planned  facility  may  affect  one  or  more  properties  listed,  or  eligible  for  listing,  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (“  NRHP”) 
 (“  Historic  Properties”).  9  If  the  Commission  finds  after  submission  of  an  EA  that  a  proposed  action  will  not  have  a  significant  environmental  effect,  it  will  issue  a  finding  of  no  significant  impact  (“  FONSI”)  and 
 process  the  application.  10  If  a  proposed  action  will  have  a  significant  environmental  effect  and  the  applicant  does  not  choose  to  amend  its  application,  11  the  Commission  will  not  grant  the  application  unless 
 the  Commission  first  completes  an  EIS.  12 
 4.  In  August  1999,  Western  constructed  a  180-  foot  monopole  tower  on  a  bluff  overlooking  Medora,  North  Dakota,  for  use  by  WWC  in  connection  with  its  operation  of  Station  KNKN343  in 


 CMA583  -  North  Dakota  4  –  McKenzie.  In  November  1999,  the  State  Historical  Society  of  North  Dakota  (“  Historical  Society”),  which  is  the  State  Historic  Preservation  Officer  (“  SHPO”)  for  North  Dakota, 
 submitted  a  letter  to  the  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau  (“  WTB”)  regarding  the  tower.  13  The  letter  states  that  Western’s  tower  adversely  affects  properties  which  are  listed  in  the  National  Register  of 
 Historic  Places  and/  or  the  State  Register  of  Historic  Places.  14  The  letter  indicates  that  the  tower  affects  the  following  nearby  properties  through  a  visual  intrusion  into  their  setting:  the  Chateau  de  Mores  State 
 Historic  Site,  the  de  Mores  Packing  Plant  State  Historic  Site,  the  Theodore  Roosevelt  Maltese  Cross  Cabin,  the  Peaceful  Valley  Ranch,  and  various  other  historic  properties  in  and  around  Medora.  Several  of 
 the  Historic  Properties  are  within  one  quarter  mile  of  the  tower  15  and  the  tower  is  in  open  view  from  all  of  these  sites.  16

 such  as  the  Commission  “.  .  .  prior  to  the  issuance  of  any  license  .  .  .  [to]  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the  undertaking  on  any  district,  site,  building,  structure  or  object  that  [qualifies  as  a  Historic  Property].”

 to  Frank  Stilwell,  Commercial  Wireless  Division,  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau  (November  15,  1999)  (“  November  15,  1999  Letter”). 


 14  While  the  Commission’s  historic  preservation  rules  do  not  expressly  refer  to  properties  listed  on  state  or  local 
 registers  of  historic  properties,  such  local  registers  are  important  sources  of  information.  Where  such  locally-  listed  properties  are  found  in  the  area  of  potential  effects  (“  APE”),  they  should  be  evaluated  for  NRHP  eligibility.

 Bureau  (February  3,  2003)  (“  Western  February  2003  Letter”)  (stating  that  the  nearest  historic  site  to  the  tower  is  approximately  one  quarter  of  a  mile  away)

 5.  In  December  1999,  WTB  informed  Western  Wireless  that  Western’s  tower  “may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  historic  properties  .  .  .  .”  17  The  Bureau  also  informed  Western  that  “until  the 
 requirements  of  the  Commission’s  environmental  rules  are  met,  “construction  and  operation”  of  the  facilities  “may  be  in  violation  of  the  Commission’s  environmental  rules”  and  “[  a]  company  violating 
 these  rules  may  be  subject  to  forfeitures  .  .  .  .”  18  The  Bureau  also  directed  Western  to  meet  with  the  SHPO. 


 6.  Western  continued  to  operate  at  the  site.  For  several  years,  WTB  worked  with  Western  and  the  Historical  Society  to  attempt  to  resolve  the  matter  informally.  These  efforts  having  proved 
 unsuccessful,  WTB  referred  the  matter  to  the  Enforcement  Bureau  (“  EB”)  for  possible  enforcement  action.  19  On  October  17,  2002,  EB  sent  a  letter  of  inquiry  (“  LOI”)  to  Western,  requesting  information 
 concerning  Western’s  efforts  to  assess  whether  the  tower  might  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  environment  and  why  it  did  not  submit  an  EA  and  undergo  environmental  review  prior  to  constructing  the 
 tower.  20  Western  submitted  a  response  to  the  LOI  on  November  1,  2002.  21  In  its  response  to  the  LOI,  Western  states  that  it  complied  in  good  faith  with  the  Commission’s  rules  prior  to  constructing  its  tower. 
 Western  claims  that  it  is  now  able  to  provide  “high-  quality”  cellular  service  to  Medora  and  portions  of  I-94  adjacent  to  Medora.  Western  argues  that  prior  to  construction  of  the  tower,  the  Governor  of  North 
 Dakota  requested  that  Western  provide  cellular  service  in  Medora  for  the  Western  States  Governors’  Conference.  According  to  Western,  the  lack  of  cellular  coverage  highlighted  the  need  for  cellular  service 
 in  Medora,  and  with  the  support  of  the  Mayor  of  Medora,  it  sought  ways  to  improve  cellular  coverage  in  the  area.  Prior  to  the  submission  of  a  permit  application  for  the  current  tower,  argues  Western,  it  worked 
 with  the  City  and  consulted  with  the  National  Park  Service  to  develop  a  set  of  three  alternative  sites  for  a  possible  tower.  Western  contends  that  the  City  selected  the  third  alternative,  which  is  the  current 
 location,  and  that  this  land  was  made  available  by  the  Theodore  Roosevelt  Medora  Foundation,  a  local  historic  preservation  group.  Western  indicates  also  that  the  City  selected  the  tower  location  as  the 
 alternative  farthest  from  any  historic  properties  without  being  located  within  the  national  park,  and  that  according  to  Western’s  engineer,  the  nearest  historic  site  to  the  tower  is  approximately  ¼  mile  away. 
 Western  states  that  it  submitted  a  “City  of  Historic  Medora  Zoning  –  Development  Permit  and  Application  Form”  (“  Application”)  for  consideration  by  the  City  Council  proposing  a  cellular 
 communications  facility.  Western  also  indicates  that  it  submitted  a  scale  drawing  of  the  tower  and  tower  site  with  its  application. 


 7.  Western  claims  that  in  reviewing  zoning  applications  such  as  Western’s,  the  City  Council  is  charged  with  examining  the  possible  effects  of  any  proposed  construction  upon  the  historical  integrity 
 of  the  City.  Western  states  that,  under  the  City’s  Zoning  Articles,  the  City  Council  is  directed  “to  regulate  all  facets  of  construction  to  preserve  the  historical  integrity  of  the  City  of  Medora,”  and  “to  prevent

 Id.  (emphasis  added).  In  February  2000,  WTB  again  informed  Western  that  if  the  situation  was  not  resolved,  it  “may  be  subject  to  enforcement  action  by  the  Commission.” 


 19  Because  the  Commission  has  historically  focused  its  environmental  enforcement  efforts  on  the  kind  of  informal 
 resolution  attempted  by  WTB  in  this  case,  WTB  and  other  licensing  Bureaus  have  primary  responsibility  for  environmental  enforcement.  47  C.  F.  R.  §  0.111(  a)(  11)  Note.  The  rules  also  provide  for  referral  of  such  matters  from 


 the  licensing  bureaus  to  EB  upon  mutual  agreement  of  the  Bureaus.  Id.,  §  0.111(  a)(  14).  We  take  this  opportunity  to  state  our  strong  support  for  an  enforcement-  oriented  approach  in  the  protection  of  the  environment.  We  direct 
 referrals  to  EB  of  violations  by  licensees  or  tower  owners  where  appropriate  and  continued  strong  enforcement  action  by  EB  where  such  action  is  appropriate.

 structures  which  detract  from  the  aesthetic  harmony,  style,  form,  color,  proportion,  texture  or  materials  of  the  district.”  22  Further,  Western  claims  that  the  Zoning  Articles  state  that  “[  i]  n  order  to  protect  the  City’s 
 historical  integrity,  the  entire  City  and  the  areas  under  its  zoning  jurisdiction  are  hereby  zoned  as  a  Historical  Integrity  District.”  23  Western  states  that  this  includes  the  site  where  it  constructed  its  tower. 
 Western  indicates  that  its  zoning  application  was  placed  on  public  notice,  the  community  was  given  five  days  in  which  to  file  comments  against  the  proposed  tower  construction,  and  no  comments  were  received. 
 Western  states  that  subsequently,  the  Zoning  Board  unanimously  approved  its  application  on  June  1,  1999. 


 8.  Western  asserts  that  it  applies  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  Commission’s  rules  to  determine  whether  a  proposed  action  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  environment.  Western  also  states  that  one 
 of  these  criteria  states  that  an  EA  is  required  if  a  proposed  facility  “’may  affect’  a  historical  property  of  national  significance.”  24  Western  adds  that  although  the  rule  does  not  explicitly  prescribe  how  licensees 
 must  make  this  assessment,  a  note  following  the  rules  suggests  that  “inquiries  also  may  be  made  to  the  appropriate  State  Historic  Preservation  Officer,”  and  thus  such  inquiry  is  one  option  available  to 
 licensees.  25  Western  contends  that  in  light  of  the  foregoing,  and  particularly  the  city’s  review  and  approval,  it  believed  the  tower  to  be  categorically  excluded  from  FCC  environmental  processing  on 
 historic  preservation  grounds.  26  Western  states  that  after  its  tower  was  constructed,  it  learned  that  the  Historical  Society  had  raised  concerns  with  the  Commission  regarding  the  effect  of  the  tower  on 
 properties  listed  or  eligible  for  listing  in  the  NRHP.  Western  claims  that  when  it  became  aware  of  such  concerns  it  undertook  an  extensive  effort  to  obtain  public  comment  and  offered  various  mitigation 
 measures,  but  that  none  of  these  proposals  has  been  satisfactory  to  all  parties.  Western  also  states  that  it  remains  willing  to  prepare  an  EA  upon  Commission  request.  27 


 9.  On  January  14,  2003,  the  Enforcement  Bureau  sent  a  second  LOI  to  Western,  requesting  it  to  explain  under  what  authority  it  believes  it  may  provide  service  from  its  tower  in  Medora.  In  addition, 
 Western  was  directed  to  explain  what  steps  it  took  to  comply  with  Section  1.1307(  a)(  4)  of  the  Rules  and  what  efforts  it  made  to  determine  whether  the  Chateau  de  Mores,  the  de  Mores  Packing  Plant,  the 
 Theodore  Roosevelt  Maltese  Cross  Cabin  and  the  Peaceful  Valley  Ranch  are  listed,  or  are  eligible  for  listing,  in  the  NRHP.  28  Western  submitted  a  response  to  the  second  LOI  on  February  3,  2003.  29  Western 
 indicates  that  under  Section  22.165(  c)  of  the  Rules,  a  licensee  may  operate  “additional  transmitters  at  additional  locations  on  the  same  channel  or  channel  block  as  its  existing  system”  without  prior 
 Commission  approval  if  certain  conditions  are  met. 
 10.  Western  contends  that  although  its  five  year  build  out  period  in  the  McKenzie  RSA  expired  before  construction  of  the  Medora  Tower,  the  service  area  boundary  of  that  site  remained  within 


 Western’s  authorized  Cellular  Geographic  Service  Area  (“  CGSA”).  Also,  Western  argues  that  its

 requires  an  EA  where  a  proposed  facility  “may  affect  districts,  sites,  buildings,  structures  or  objects,  significant  in  American  history,  architecture,  archeology,  engineering  or  culture,  that  are  listed,  or  eligible  for  listing  in  the 


 National  Register  of  Historic  Places.”  25

 environmental  review  under  Sections  1.1301  through  1.1319  of  the  Rules  indicated  that  construction  and  operation  of  the  Medora  site  would  not  have  a  significant  environmental  effect.  Western  also  states  that  it 
 relied  on  the  City  Council’s  approval  process  to  determine  whether  its  tower  would  affect  historic  properties  listed  or  eligible  for  listing  in  the  NRHP.  Western  claims,  that  with  the  exception  of  the 
 Peaceful  Valley  Ranch,  the  historic  properties  listed  in  the  Commission’s  second  LOI,  as  well  as  several  other  historic  properties,  are  located  in  areas  under  the  City’s  zoning  jurisdiction.  Western  claims  that 
 potential  impacts  on  the  Peaceful  Valley  Ranch,  located  approximately  five  miles  from  the  tower,  had  not  previously  been  raised  as  an  issue  by  any  parties.  30  Western  notes  that  a  complete  listing  of  properties  in 
 the  NRHP  is  available  online,  but  argues  that  the  focus  of  its  review  has  been  whether  its  tower  affected  any  of  these  sites.  Finally,  Western  summarizes  the  information  it  provided  in  response  to  the  first  LOI. 


 III.  DISCUSSION 
 11.  Section  22.165  of  the  Rules  states  in  part  that  “a  [Public  Mobile  Services]  licensee  may  operate  additional  transmitters  at  additional  locations  on  the  same  channel  or  channel  block  as  its  existing 


 system  without  obtaining  prior  Commission  approval”  if  certain  conditions  are  met.  31  One  of  the  conditions  that  must  be  met  is  that  the  “additional  transmitters  must  not  have  a  significant  environmental 
 effect”  under  Sections  1.1301  through  1.1319  of  the  Rules.  32  Similarly,  under  Section  1.947(  a)  of  the  Rules,  “[  a]  ll  major  modifications  [of  wireless  licenses],  as  defined  in  §  1.929  of  [the  Rules]  .  .  .  ,  require 
 prior  Commission  approval.”  33  Section  1.929(  a)  classifies  the  following  as  a  “major”  modification  for  all  services:  “[  a]  pplication  or  amendment  requesting  authorization  for  a  facility  that  would  have  a  significant 
 environmental  effect  as  defined  by  §§  1.1301  through  1.1319  of  the  rules  .  .  .  .”  34 
 12.  Under  Section  1.1312(  b)  of  the  Rules,  an  EA  must  be  submitted  to  and  ruled  on  by  the  Commission  prior  to  the  initiation  of  construction  if  a  proposed  facility  that  is  not  otherwise  subject  to 


 pre-  construction  authorization  “may  have  a  significant  environmental  impact.”  35  Section  1.1307(  a)(  4)  specifies  as  one  criterion  of  potential  significant  environmental  effect  “[  f]  acilities  that  may  affect  districts, 
 sites,  buildings,  structures  or  objects,  significant  in  American  history,  architecture,  archeology,  engineering  or  culture,  that  are  listed,  or  are  eligible  for  listing,  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic 
 Places.”  36  Where  approval  of  an  application  requiring  an  EA  would  have  a  significant  environmental  effect  and  a  FONSI  therefore  cannot  be  issued,  Section  1.1305  of  the  Rules  requires  the  preparation  of  a 
 Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (DEIS)  and  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (FEIS)  (collectively  referred  to  as  EISs)  prior  to  Commission  action.  37 


 13.  Here,  Western’s  construction  of  the  Medora  Tower  not  only  may  have  had  a  significant  environmental  effect  but,  in  fact,  did  have  and  continues  to  have  such  an  effect.  It  is  undisputed  that 
 Western  constructed  its  tower  near,  and  in  plain  view  of,  sites  that  are  listed,  or  eligible  for  listing,  in  the  NRHP,  including  the  Chateau  de  Mores  State  Historic  Site,  the  de  Mores  Packing  Plant  State  Historic 
 Site,  and  the  Theodore  Roosevelt  Maltese  Cross  Cabin.  It  is  also  undisputed  that  the  Historical  Society 


 30  We  note  that  in  the  Historical  Society’s  November  1999  letter  to  the  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau,  it 
 asserted  that  Western’s  tower  adversely  affected  the  Peaceful  Valley  Ranch.  31

 did  not  conclude  prior  to  construction  that  the  tower  would  not  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Historic  Properties.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  construction  of  the  tower  may  have  had  a  significant 
 environmental  effect  under  Section  1.1307(  a)(  4)  of  the  Rules.  38  Our  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  the  Historical  Society,  which  is  the  relevant  SHPO,  concluded  after  the  fact  that  the  tower  has  an 
 adverse  effect  on  historic  properties.  Consequently,  at  a  minimum,  Commission  approval  following  the  filing  of  an  EA  was  required  prior  to  construction  and  operation.  As  a  result,  contrary  to  Western’s 
 assertion,  it  was  required  to  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Commission  an  EA,  and  receive  Commission  authorization,  prior  to  the  construction  of  its  tower  and  operation  from  that  location.  39 


 14.  Moreover,  in  this  instance  not  only  was  Western  required  to  file  an  EA  and  obtain  Commission  authorization  prior  to  construction,  but  because  the  constructed  tower  actually  has  significant 
 environmental  effects,  it  was  required  to  await  completion  of  an  EIS.  40  Based  on  the  Historical  Society’s  recommendation,  other  documents  in  the  record,  and  our  independent  assessment,  we  find  that  the 
 Medora  Tower  has  an  adverse  effect  on  at  least  four  sites  listed  in  the  NRHP  –  Saint  Mary’s  Church,  the  Medora  Doll  House,  the  Old  Billings  County  Courthouse,  and  the  de  Mores  Packing  Plant  Ruins  –  and  on 
 at  least  one  eligible  site,  the  Maltese  Cross  Cabin.  With  respect  to  each  of  these  sites,  all  of  which  are  located  within  approximately  one  half  mile  or  less  of  the  tower,  the  tower  on  the  bluff  presents  a  modern 
 intrusion  that  looms  over  these  Historic  Properties,  thus  introducing  an  obtrusive  incongruous  element  into  a  setting  that  otherwise  retains  largely  the  same  feel  that  it  had  at  the  time  the  structures  were  built. 
 Hence,  under  Section  800.5(  a)(  1)  of  the  ACHP  Regulations,  36  C.  F.  R.  §  800.5(  a)(  1),  41  the  tower  has  an  adverse  effect  on  Historic  Properties. 


 15.  In  view  of  our  finding  that  Western’s  Medora  tower  not  only  may  have,  but  has  had  and  continues  to  have,  a  significant  environmental  effect,  we  reject  Western’s  argument  that  it  has  authority 
 under  Section  22.165  of  the  Rules  42  to  operate  its  tower.  Specifically,  Section  22.165  provides  that  licensees  may  operate  additional  transmitters  for  existing  systems  only  if,  inter  alia,  the  additional 
 transmitters  do  not  have  a  significant  environmental  effect.  43  Thus,  under  Section  22.165,  a  licensee  may  not  operate  additional  transmitters  without  prior  Commission  approval  if  its  action  may  have  a  significant 
 environmental  effect.  Because  Western’s  tower,  in  fact,  has  a  significant  environmental  effect,  it  could  not  have  met  the  Commission’s  requirements  for  authorization  without  prior  approval  under  Section 


 38  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.1307(  a)(  4). 
 39  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  1.  1307(  a)(  4),  1.1308,  1.1311. 
 40  Where  construction  of  a  facility  is  deemed  a  Commission  action  and  that  facility  has  an  unmitigated  adverse 
 effect  on  one  or  more  Historic  Properties,  the  Commission  has  for  some  time  viewed  such  a  facility  as  having  a  significant  effect  on  the  environment.  For  example,  in  its  1974  Report  and  Order  implementing  NEPA,  the 


 Commission  determined  that  the  following  “classes  of  facilities”  would  be  classified  as  “major”  under  NEPA:  those  “[  f]  acilities  which  will  affect  districts,  sites,  buildings,  structures,  or  objects,  significant  in  American  history, 
 architecture,  archeology  or  culture  which  are  listed  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  or  are  eligible  for  listing.”  Implementation  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  49  FCC2d  1313,  1319-  1320  (1974) 
 recon.  granted  in  part  and  otherwise  denied,  56  FCC2d  635  (1975).  41 
 An  adverse  effect  is  found  when  an  undertaking  may  alter,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  of  the  characteristics  of  a  historic  property  that  qualify  the  property  for  inclusion  in  the  National  Register  in  a  manner  that  would  diminish  the 


 integrity  of  the  property's  location,  design,  setting,  materials,  workmanship,  feeling,  or  association.  Consideration  shall  be  given  to  all  qualifying  characteristics  of  a  historic  property,  including  those  that  may  have  been  identified 
 subsequent  to  the  original  evaluation  of  the  property's  eligibility  for  the  National  Register.  Adverse  effects  may  include  reasonably  foreseeable  effects  caused  by  the  undertaking  that  may  occur  later  in  time,  be  farther  removed  in 
 distance  or  be  cumulative.  Section  800.5(  a)(  1)  of  the  ACHP  Regulations,  36  C.  F.  R.  §  800.5(  a)(  1).  See  also  36  C.  F.  R.  800.  5(  a)(  2)(  v)  “Introduction  of  visual,  atmospheric  or  audible  elements  that  diminish  the  integrity  of  the 
 property’s  significant  historical  features.”  42

 22.165  of  the  Rules.  In  addition,  Western  has  violated  Section  1.947(  a)  of  the  Rules,  44  which  required  Western  to  secure  prior  Commission  approval  of  its  construction  of  the  Medora  Tower  because  that  tower 
 “would  have  a  significant  environmental  effect”  and  is,  therefore,  a  major  modification  of  Western’s  license  under  Section  1.929(  a)(  4)  of  the  Rules.  45  Thus,  Western  constructed  the  Medora  Tower  and 
 continues  to  operate  at  this  site  without  Commission  approval.  Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  Western  apparently  willfully  and  repeatedly  violated  Section  301  of  the  Act  by  operating  radio  transmitting 
 equipment  from  an  unauthorized  location.  We  note  that  this  violation  has  continued  into  the  one-  year  limitations  period  for  a  forfeiture.  46 


 16.  The  fact  that  the  City  Council  and  others  may  have  considered  historic  preservation  issues,  or  that  Western  may  have  worked  cooperatively  with  the  WTB  and  others  to  try  to  resolve  the 
 problem  after  construction  and  operation  of  the  Medora  tower,  has  no  bearing  on  the  underlying  violation  in  this  case,  which  occurred  before  any  such  cooperative  efforts  and  has  continued  since.  In  particular, 
 we  note  that  the  Zoning  Board’s  approval  of  Western’s  application  is  irrelevant  to  whether  the  tower  has  a  significant  environmental  effect  under  the  Commission’s  rules.  Section  1.1311(  c)  of  the  Rules  states  that 
 an  EA  should  be  accompanied  with  evidence  of  site  approval  obtained  from  local  or  Federal  land  use  authorities,  thus  recognizing  that  such  zoning  approval  does  not  preclude  the  need  for  an  EA  (or,  in 
 appropriate  cases,  an  EIS).  47  Further,  Section  1.1311(  e)  provides  that  an  EA  need  not  be  submitted  if  another  Federal  Government  agency  has  responsibility  for  deciding  whether  a  proposed  facility  will  have 
 a  significant  environmental  effect,  thus  recognizing  that  state  or  local  environmental  review  does  not  replace  the  need  for  FCC  or  other  federal  environmental  review.  48 


 17.  Similarly,  our  finding  that  Western  is  in  violation  of  the  Act  and  is  apparently  liable  for  forfeiture  is  not  affected  by  Western’s  claim  that  it  offered  to  file  a  post-  construction  EA  with  the 
 Commission  and  that  Commission  staff  discouraged  such  a  filing.  The  rules  require  Western  to  file  an  EA  before  construction  of  a  facility,  such  as  the  Medora  Tower,  that  may  significantly  affect  the 
 environment.  49  Accordingly,  a  post-  construction  EA  would  not  in  itself  end  Western’s  violation  of  those  rules.  Moreover,  because  this  tower,  in  fact,  does  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  environment,  the  filing 
 of  an  EA  for  the  existing  tower  would  not  have  led  to  a  FONSI  that  could  have  ended  the  violation.  Finally,  even  if  Western  would  have  benefited  from  the  filing  of  an  EA  but  chose  not  to  do  so  in  reliance 
 on  the  staff,  such  reliance  was  at  Western’s  risk.  50 
 18.  Because  the  Medora  Tower  has  a  significant  environmental  effect  under  the  Commission’s  rules,  Western  was  required  to  obtain  Commission  approval  following  preparation  of  an 


 EIS  prior  to  construction  of,  and  operation  at,  the  site.  Moreover,  because  the  construction  may  have  had  a  significant  environmental  effect,  Western  was  required  to  file  an  EA  and  obtain  a  FONSI  prior  to 
 construction  and  operation.  Thus,  Western  did  not  have  authority  to  operate  its  tower  under  Sections 
 44  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.947(  a). 
 45  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.929(  a)(  4).

 48  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.1311  (e).  With  respect  to  Western’s  “consultation”  with  the  National  Park  Service,  the  National 
 Park  Service  has  indicated  that,  at  the  time,  it  was  unaware  that  the  FCC  had  rules  relating  to  the  location  of  communications  towers.  Letter  from  Noel  R.  Poe,  Superintendent,  National  Park  Service,  U.  S.  Department  of  the 


 Interior,  to  RaeAnn  Kelsch,  Manager  of  External  Affairs,  Western  Wireless  Corporation  (July  6,  2000).  The  National  Park  Service  also  notes:  “It  is  not  the  National  Park  Service,  TRMF  [Theodore  Roosevelt  Medora 
 Foundation],  nor  the  City’s  responsibility  to  know  and  abide  by  FCC  Regulations.  That  responsibility  rests  solely  with  WW  [Western].”  Id.

 22.165  or  1.  947  of  the  Rules,  51  and  its  continued  unauthorized  operation  of  its  tower  violates  Section  301  of  the  Act. 
 Forfeiture  Amount 
 19.  Section  503(  b)  of  the  Act  provides  that  any  person  who  willfully  or  repeatedly  fails  to  comply  substantially  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  any  license,  or  willfully  fails  to  comply  with  any  of 


 the  provisions  of  the  Act  or  of  any  rule,  regulation  or  order  issued  by  the  Commission  thereunder,  shall  be  liable  for  a  forfeiture  penalty.  52  The  term  “willful”  as  used  in  Section  503(  b)  has  been  interpreted  to  mean 
 simply  that  the  acts  or  omissions  are  committed  knowingly.  53  The  term  “repeated”  means  that  the  violation  occurred  on  more  than  one  day.  54  Section  503(  b)(  2)(  B)  of  the  Act  authorizes  the  Commission  to 
 assess  a  forfeiture  of  up  to  $120,000  for  each  violation  by  a  common  carrier,  or  each  day  of  a  continuing  violation,  up  to  a  statutory  maximum  of  $1,200,000  for  a  single  act  or  failure  to  act.  55  In  determining  the 
 appropriate  forfeiture  amount,  we  must  consider  the  factors  enumerated  in  Section  503(  b)(  2)(  D)  of  the  Act,  including  “the  nature,  circumstances,  extent  and  gravity  of  the  violation,  and,  with  respect  to  the 
 violator,  the  degree  of  culpability,  any  history  of  prior  offenses,  ability  to  pay,  and  such  other  matters  as  justice  may  require.”  56 


 20.  The  Commission’s  Forfeiture  Policy  Statement  and  Amendment  of  Section  1.80(  b)  of  the  Rules  to  Incorporate  the  Forfeiture  Guidelines  (“  Forfeiture  Policy  Statement”)  57  and  Section  1.  80  of  the 
 Rules  sets  a  base  forfeiture  amount  of  $4,000  for  operation  at  an  unauthorized  location.  However,  a  significant  upward  adjustment  is  justified  in  this  case  since  Western’s  violation  continued  for  three  and  a 
 half  years  after  WTB  informed  Western  that  the  tower  “may  have”  a  significant  environmental  effect,  and  continues  to  this  date.  Western’s  tower  has  had  and  continues  to  have  a  significant  environmental  effect 
 on  Historic  Properties.  58  We  therefore  consider  this  to  be  a  very  serious  instance  of  a  Section  301  violation  for  which  a  sizable  increase  in  the  base  forfeiture  amount  under  the  upward  adjustment  criteria 
 contained  in  Section  1.80  and  the  Forfeiture  Policy  Statement  is  warranted.  59  Accordingly,  applying  the  Forfeiture  Policy  Statement  and  statutory  factors  to  the  instant  case,  we  conclude  that  Western  is 
 apparently  liable  for  a  $200,  000  forfeiture. 
 21.  It  is  important  that  Western  not  be  permitted  to  continue  to  benefit  from  its  failure  to

 comply  with  the  environmental  rules.  Accordingly,  Western  is  hereby  directed  to  file,  within  30  days  of  the  release  of  this  NAL,  a  sworn  statement  describing  its  plans  to  cease  operation  at  its  Medora  Tower  site 
 or  bring  that  site  into  compliance  with  our  environmental  rules.  The  statement  must  be  filed  either  with  Western’s  response  to  this  NAL,  or  separately  if  it  does  not  respond  (e.  g.,  if  it  pays  the  proposed 
 forfeiture).  Failure  to  cease  operation  will  constitute  an  apparent  further  continuing  violation  that  will  subject  Western  to  possible  increased  enforcement  action,  e.  g.,  higher  forfeitures  and/  or  potential 
 revocation  of  its  underlying  license  for  the  community.  We  note  that  simply  applying  for  authorization  or  applying  for  Special  Temporary  Authority  (“  STA”),  or  proposing  a  remedial  plan  would  not  bring 
 Western  into  compliance  and  would  not  insulate  Western  from  further  enforcement  action  for  operation  prior  to  receipt  of  authorization.  Finally,  should  Western  plan  any  changes  to  its  facilities  or  service  in 
 the  Medora  area  in  response  to  this  NAL  or  subsequent  Commission  orders,  we  remind  Western  of  its  obligation  under  Section  1.  1308(  a)  of  the  Rules  60  to  file  an  EA  if  any  of  those  changes  may  significantly 
 affect  the  environment  under  Section  1.1307(  a)  of  the  Rules.  61 
 IV.  CONCLUSION 
 22.  Accordingly,  IT  IS  ORDERED  THAT,  pursuant  to  Section  503(  b)  of  the  Act,  and  Section  1.80  of  the  Rules,  62  Western  Wireless  Corporation,  is  hereby  NOTIFIED  of  its  APPARENT 


 LIABILITY  FOR  A  FORFEITURE  in  the  amount  of  two  hundred  thousand  dollars  ($  200,000)  for  willfully  and  repeatedly  violating  Section  301  of  the  Act. 


 23.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  THAT,  pursuant  to  Section  1.80  of  the  Rules,  within  thirty  days  of  the  release  date  of  this  NOTICE  OF  APPARENT  LIABILITY,  Western  Wireless  Corporation 
 SHALL  PAY  the  full  amount  of  the  proposed  forfeiture  or  SHALL  FILE  a  written  statement  seeking  reduction  or  cancellation  of  the  proposed  forfeiture. 


 24.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  THAT,  within  30  days  of  the  release  of  this  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for  Forfeiture,  Western  file  a  sworn  statement  in  accordance  with  paragraph  21  above. 
 25.  Payment  of  the  forfeiture  may  be  made  by  mailing  a  check  or  similar  instrument,  payable  to  the  order  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  to  the  Forfeiture  Collection  Section,  Finance 
 Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.  O.  Box  73482,  Chicago,  Illinois  60673-  7482.  The  payment  must  include  the  FCC  Registration  Number  (FRN)  and  the  NAL/  Acct.  No.  referenced  in  the 
 caption. 
 26.  The  response,  if  any,  and  the  statement  referenced  in  paragraph  21  above,  must  be  mailed  to  the  Office  of  the  Secretary,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  445  12th  Street,  S.  W.,  Washington,

 27.  The  Commission  will  not  consider  reducing  or  canceling  a  forfeiture  in  response  to  a  claim  of  inability  to  pay  unless  the  petitioner  submits:  (1)  federal  tax  returns  for  the  most  recent  three-year 
 period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according  to  generally  accepted  accounting  practices  (“  GAAP”);  or  (3)  some  other  reliable  and  objective  documentation  that  accurately  reflects  the  petitioner’s 
 current  financial  status.  Any  claim  of  inability  to  pay  must  specifically  identify  the  basis  for  the  claim  by  reference  to  the  financial  documentation  submitted.

 STATEMENT  OF  CHAIRMAN  MICHAEL  K.  POWELL 
 Re:  Western  Wireless  Corporation  and  WWC  Holding  Co.,  Inc.,  Licensee  of  Cellular  Radio  Station  KNKN343,  CMA583  –  North  Dakota  4  –  McKenzie  RSA;  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for 
 Forfeiture 
 I  recently  announced  a  comprehensive,  proactive  approach  for  addressing  the  Commission’s  responsibilities  in  the  communications  tower-  siting  area.  Enforcement  action,  where  necessary,  will  be  an 
 integral  part  of  this  approach  as  demonstrated  by  our  action  today. 
 As  I  described  in  the  Action  Plan,  the  siting  of  communications  towers  places  a  number  of  worthy,  but  competing,  federal  interests  in  tension  --  widespread  deployment  of  advanced 
 telecommunications  networks,  the  protection  of  birds  and  endangered  species,  aviation  safety,  and  the  preservation  of  historic  and  cultural  sites,  to  name  a  few.  Balancing  these  interests  requires  cooperation 
 from  a  number  of  interested  parties  --  including  state  and  federal  agencies,  Indian  tribes,  environmental  groups,  and  the  communications  and  tower  industries.
