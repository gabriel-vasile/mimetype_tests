Research Experience: 
 MiniBooNE Experiment (E898), member 2001-present: MiniBooNE is a neutrino
experi- 
ment at Fermilab designed to look for oscillations from muon neutrinos to
electron neutri- 
nos. The Fermilab Booster provides an intense beam of protons onto a target
producing 
pions which decay and result in a beam of muon neutrinos. These neutrinos
are directed 
toward the MiniBooNE detector where a search for electron neutrinos is
performed. 
{ Participated in HARP experiment to measure pion production on MiniBooNE
target 
and reduce systematic uncertainties on MiniBooNE neutrino  
{ Led Columbia University HARP group and guided tasking of graduate
students. 
{ Supervised data taking at HARP for MiniBooNE. 
{ Tested and developed diagnostic system to monitor accelerator devices in
Booster 
and identify instabilities. 
{ Integrated new diagnostic system into permanent data logger to allow long
term 
machine performance studies. 
{ Participated in project to use ramped dipole correctors in Booster to
control beam 
motion. Used new correctors to reduce beam losses near sensitive equipment. 
{ Explored resonant extraction of beam halo as method to reduce uncontrolled
beam 
loss. 
{ Authored and edited technical documents using Latex, MS Powerpoint, MS
Word, 
and Adobe Illustrator. 
{ Experienced in UNIX, Microsoft Windows NT, VMS, Fortran, C++, JAVA, HTML, 
GEANT4, ICOOL, and data analysis languages (ROOT, PAW). 
 HARP (Hadron Production Experiment at CERN - PS214) member 2001-present:
HARP 
is a xed target experiment at the CERN PS. This large acceptance
spectrometer is used to 
systematically study hadron production for protons incident upon a large
range of target 
nuclei. Specically, pi + and pi production cross sections are measured
directly from the 
MiniBooNE target to reduce systematic uncertainties on the MiniBooNE
neutrino  
{ Enabled measurement of cross section backgrounds by identifying need for
empty 
target data for each HARP target. 
{ Ensured high data quality by calculating appropriate beam settings and
monitoring 
spectrometer detectors. 
{ Led HARP Production Group which provided data and Monte Carlo samples to
entire 
experiment for calibration and analysis purposes. 
{ Contributed to measurement of pi + production cross section in p-Al
collisions at 12.9 
GeV/c which will be used to reduce systematic error in K2K neutrino  
{ Coordinated data management on three continents while maintaining data
quality 
and consistency of production methods. 
{ Developed system to enable remote-site HARP analysis at Fermilab, Los
Alamos 
National Lab, and universities in Europe and Japan. 
{ Created accurate material geometries for HARP GEANT4 simulation code. 

Linda R. Coney 3 
{ Analyzed, tuned, and validated simulations of HARP threshold Cerenkov
detector. 
{ Developed particle momentum estimator to increase number of available
tracks in 
cross section calculation. 
 D^_ Experiment, member 1995-2004: D^_ is a collider experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron 
where studies are done on phenomena resulting from pp collisions at a center
of mass energy 
of nearly 2 TeV. The detector is geared primarily toward the investigation
of large p T 
phenomena. Top quark analyses, precision measurements of W and Z bosons,
perturbative 
QCD testing, and new hard di
raction studies are all done at D^_ . 
{ Identied rst di
ractive Z boson production in pp collisions. 
{ Measured di
ractive component of W and Z boson production in pp collisions. 
{ Developed extensive Monte Carlo (PYTHIA, POMPYT26) studies to investigate 
validity of pomeron exchange as driving mechanism for di
ractive W and Z pro- 
duction. 
{ Calculated di
ractive dijet production rates predicted by pomeron models using 
PYTHIA and POMPYT26 for the hard single di
raction analysis. 
{ Discovered miscalculation of reconstructed photon energies which degraded
calibra- 
tion of jet response. 
{ Implemented photon energy scale correction which dramatically improved D^_
jet 
response calculation. 
{ Directed Central Fiber Tracker(CFT) ber lightguide quality control
project. 
{ Developed testing procedure using X-ray source and scintillating ber
ribbons to 
measure production quality of lightguides fabricated for CFT. 
{ Performed light attenuation and radiation damage studies on scintillating
bers.
