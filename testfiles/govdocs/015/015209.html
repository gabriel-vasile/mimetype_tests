We have accumulated evidence across four studies that find the                 neurotic group of offenders to be of particular interest to correctional                 practitioners and policy makers. They have made poor adjustments                 to prison, had the highest long-term recidivism rates, performed                 poorly in a cognitive skills intervention and assist in differentiating                 child molesters. The findings also illustrate that personality                 is an important factor across a number of different samples, lending                 support for the reliability of the Jesness Inventory. </p>              <p>Psychological, personality-based classification systems have                 been used since the 1960s to develop differential treatment and                 supervision plans for offenders (Van Voorhis, 2000). This approach                 assumed that, even apart from their risk of re-offending, offenders                 were not all alike and that no single treatment modality worked                 with all types of offenders across the full spectrum of correctional                 settings (Warren, 1971; Palmer, 1974). In support, the early proponents                 of differential treatment found that offenders who were placed                 in treatment modalities matched to personality characteristics                 were more likely to perform better than those who were inappropriately                 placed (Jesness, 1971; Palmer, 1974; 2002; Warren, 1983). </p>              <p> More contemporary writings place personality among a larger                 group of offender <I>responsivity </I>factors (Andrews, Bonta,                 and Hoge, 1990), including learning styles, motivation levels,                 intellectual functioning, and other traits, which are likely to                 become barriers to the success of some types of interventions.                 Notwithstanding the promising results of studies conducted through                 the 1970s and 1980s, responsivity remains under-researched and                 seldom considered in correctional practice. Indeed, responsivity                 is a frequent topic of discussion in correctional policy meetings,                 non-empirical writings, and staff training, but it is seldom structured                 into current correctional practice or research.               <p> This article summarizes the results of four recent studies that                 employed an offender-based personality typology (using the Jesness                 Inventory, 1996) to examine the importance of personality in prison                 adjustment, long-term offender recidivism, success in cognitive                 programming, and dynamics of child molestation. Across these samples                 of male offenders, we found a consistent pattern suggesting that                 high-anxiety offenders, those referred to as neurotic offenders                 on the personality classification systems, are distinct from other                 offenders in extremely important ways. The findings urge renewed                 consideration not only of offender personality but also of a distinct                 type of offender who receives limited attention in contemporary                 correctional treatment.               <p> As noted in more detailed descriptions of the offender personality                 typologies (e.g., see Warren, 1971, Van Voorhis, 1994; Van Voorhis                 &amp; Sperber, 1999), the neurotic personality type is one of                 four offender personality types common to the various personality                 classification systems (Megargee &amp; Bohn, 1979; Quay, 1983;                 Jesness, 1988, 1996; Warren, 1983). The most common types and                 their descriptions are as follows:               <p> I-level, as measured by the Jesness Inventory, identifies nine                 personality types<sup>*</sup>                 Among adults, these can be collapsed into the following four types                 (Van Voorhis, 1994) that are of primary interest to the present                 study: a) antisocial, who are described as manipulative, hostile,                 and possessing antisocial values and peers; b) neurotic, or highly                 anxious, defensive, and insecure; c) dependent, described as dependent,                 followers, who do not evidence antisocial values/attitudes; and                 d) situational, who are prosocial, conforming, and, at times,                 na•ve. The pattern across various I-level studies finds that types                 comprising the antisocial offenders (e.g., Aa, CFC, MP) and the                 neurotic offenders (e.g., Na, Nx) most often differentiate offenders                 in terms of their success in programs (e.g. Heide, 1983; Jesness,                 1971; Palmer, 1974; 2002; Van Voorhis, Spruance, Ritchie, Listwan,                 Seabrook, &amp; Pealer, 2002; Warren, 1983), their offense patterns                 (e.g., Harris, 1979; Heide, 1992,1999), and their prison adjustments                 (Van Voorhis, 1994).               <p> In narrowing our focus to the neurotic offender, it is important                 to remember that anxiety can exist both as a state of mind and                 as a personality trait. The type of neuroticism discussed here                 does not relate to the general feeling of anxiety that most experience                 in response to situational pressures (e.g., anxiety over a licensing                 exam or a loved one's illness). Here we are concerned with anxiety                 as a trait, an enduring characteristic that more persistently                 influences individual perceptions and behavior. Studies conclude                 that individuals higher in trait anxiety are consistently more                 prone to perceive greater danger in their relationships and to                 respond with greater elevations of situational or state anxiety                 (Speilberger, 1985). Individuals with high trait anxiety, often                 called negative affectivity, tended to have a very negative view                 of themselves, to worry more often, and to dwell on frustrations                 and disappointments (Watson &amp; Clark, 1984). Moreover, individuals                 high in neuroticism were shown to be more distressed on average                 in comparison to low neuroticism subjects and to have lower thresholds                 for responding to stressful events (Bolger &amp; Schillings, 1991).                 Although some individuals may experience these feelings as a state                 of mind during times of stress, those high in negative affectivity                 manifest these feelings even in the absence of stress (Watson                 &amp; Clark, 1984).               <p> Although personality was neglected for many years in criminology,                 recent research finds it to be an important predictor of behavior.                 For example, research by Caspi, Moffitt, Silva, Stouthamer-Loeber,                 Kreuger, and Schmutte (1994) found that low constraint and negative                 emotionality were predictors of criminal behavior regardless of                 age, geographic location, race, and gender. Further, constraint                 and negative emotionality emerged as correlates among life-course                 persistent offenders (Kreuger, Schmutte, Caspi, Moffitt, Campbell,                 &amp; Silva, 1994). Traits pertaining to negative emotionality                 and low constraint were also implicated in relationship difficulties                 (Moffitt, 1993) and health risk behaviors (e.g., violent crime,                 alcohol dependence, sexual behavior, and dangerous driving habits)                 (Caspi, Harrington, Moffitt, Begg, Dickson, Langley &amp; Silva,                 1997). Finally, Agnew, Brezina, Wright &amp; Cullen (2002) found                 that "strain is more likely to lead to delinquency among                 those high in negative emotionality/low constraint" (p. 63).                 Importantly, the study also concluded that those high in negative                 emotionality and low in constraint did not engage in delinquency                 in the absence of strain.               <p> Since their inception, correctional, psychological classification                 systems have staked a clear position for the neurotic, high anxiety,                 offender. With youth in California, these delinquents were diagnosed                 as either neurotic anxious or neurotic acting-out according to                 the Interpersonal Maturity Level (I-level) classification system                 (Warren et al., 1966; Palmer, 2002). In the Federal Bureau of                 Prisons, the Quay Adult Internal Management System (Quay, 1983)                 identified a neurotic anxious type for adults. The Quay System                 for juvenile offenders put forward a similar type (Quay and Parsons,                 1971). Finally, the Megargee MMPI based Prison Typology (Megargee                 and Bohn, 1979) notes types Baker, George, and Jupiter. All are                 described as dealing with forms of trait anxiety.               <p> Early writings offered some concerns about these individuals,                 as exemplified by the type descriptions of the neurotic offender.                 For example, sources asserted that neurotic offenders made poor                 adjustments to prison settings; needed to be placed away from                 predatory inmates; did not improve without intervention; and were                 likely to amplify rather than resolve acting-out behaviors when                 confronted by staff. Warren described this group of individuals                 as having a "good deal of internal 'wear and tear' involving                 anxiety, guilt, a 'bad me' self image, 'negative life script'                 distorted perceptions, and dysfunctional behavior." Delinquency                 has some private meaning and is not intended simply for material                 gain or as a response to peer pressure. It may involve acting                 out of a family problem, an identity crisis, or a long-standing                 internal conflict. These individuals may also show symptoms of                 emotional disturbance, chronic or intense depression, or psychosomatic                 complaints.               <p> Both the Preston Topology Study (Jesness, 1971) and the Community                 Treatment Project (CTP) in California (Palmer, 1974; 2002; Warren,                 1983) reported that outcomes were better for these youth under                 conditions of differential treatment that accommodated anxiety                 and targeted it for treatment. Differential treatment also involved                 "matching" offenders to officers and staff trained to                 counsel issues related to anxiety. When anxiety was accommodated,                 the neurotic delinquents showed more impressive treatment gains                 than most of the other groups (Palmer, 1974). But the development                 of correctional strategies for these offenders ceased in the 1970s.               <p> Current thinking on offender therapy favors cognitive behavioral                 programs targeted to thinking skills, thinking errors, high risk                 situations, and coping strategies. This focus is well-supported                 by a large body of research, and confirmed by several meta analyses                 conducted in the 1990s. To facilitate consistent delivery, most                 current cognitive behavioral models are directed by manuals for                 facilitators. Some are scripted; most suggest activities such                 as role-playing exercises, thinking reports and group discussions.                 These are not intended to be confrontational, a well known difficulty                 for highly anxious offenders. One would think that an emphasis                 on how to think through difficult situations and to deal with                 emotions would be useful to such offenders; however the same models                 do not appear to have been developed with anxiety in mind.               <p> In referring to offender anxiety as a "responsivity trait"                 (Andrews and Bonta, 1998; Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge, 1990), it                 is assumed to affect one's ability to succeed in correctional                 programs and environments. A number of authors suggest that we                 should consider these attributes when screening offenders into                 programs, so that they are not "harmed" by the intervention                 or expected to participate in an intervention that does not work.                 Unfortunately, once we have screened neurotic offenders out of                 programs (if we do) there appear to be no contemporary alternatives.                 Consequently, the current generation of offender programming has                 little to say, directly, about anxiety. Research examining these                 concerns is summarized below.               <p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a><a name="studies"></a>              <p> <B>Description of the Studies</B>               <p> The four studies measured personality according to the Jesness                 Inventory (Jesness, 1996). In addition to 11 personality scales,                 the JI provides subtype scales, which correspond to earlier personality                 subtypes identified by the Interpersonal Maturity Classification                 System. Nine subtypes are put forward by the Jesness Inventory.                 For adults, these nine types may be collapsed further into four                 types (see Van Voorhis, 1994): a) antisocial, b) neurotic, c)                 dependent, and d) situational.              <p><I>Study 1: </I>The first study explored the comparative viability                 of several psychological classification systems for classifying                 adult male prison inmates. The relationship between the types                 identified by each classification system and prison adjustment                 emerged as an important issue. The study sampled two groups of                 federal inmates newly admitted to prison between September 1986                 and July 1988: a) 179 maximum custody inmates (response rate =                 76%); and b) 190 minimum custody inmates (response rate = 90%).                 At prison admission, the study participants completed detailed                 background interviews and several psychological inventories, including                 the Jesness Inventory. <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_table1.gif')">Table                 1</a> details the background characteristics of the sample. Inmates                 were tracked for 6 to 9 months. Follow-up data cited in this paper                 consisted of self report measures of prison misconducts and stress.                 The self-report and staff measures were cumulative scales and                 had internal consistency (alpha values) greater than 0.70. Stress                 was measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression                 Scale (Radloff, 1977). The study utilized bivariate analyses.                 See Van Voorhis (1994) for a more detailed account of the measures                 and methodology of the study.               <p><I>Study 2: </I>The second study explored whether personality,                 as measured by the Jesness Inventory, was related to recidivism.                 A longitudinal design examined long-term recidivism rates for                 the study 1 cohort of federal prison inmates (n=277) over a 10                 to 12 year period. <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_table2.gif')">Table                 2</a> details the background characteristics of the sample. Recidivism                 data, collected through NCIC in 1998, were available for approximately                 85 percent of the time 1 sample. Event history analysis was employed                 to determine the relationship between the four collapsed Jesness                 Inventory types and outcome. Failure was defined as any new arrest                 and arrest for a specific charge including drugs, property offenses,                 or violence. Control variables included race and a modified version                 of the Salient Factor Score (Hoffman and Beck, 1985). See Listwan                 (2001) for a more detailed account of the measures and methodology                 of the study.               <p> <I>Study 3: </I>The third study, Phase II of the Georgia Cognitive                 Skills Experiment, examined the effectiveness of the Reasoning                 and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) (Ross &amp; Fabiano, 1985) program                 on parolees across the State of Georgia. A focal issue of the                 study was whether some types of offenders responded differently                 to the cognitive skill intervention than others. Using an experimental                 design, male parolees were randomly assigned to either the R&amp;R                 program group (n=574) or the control group (n=581) that received                 standard parolee services without the R&amp;R program. <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_table3.gif')">Table                 3</a> illustrates the background characteristics of the individuals                 under study. Program effectiveness was determined, in part, by                 comparing experimental group and control group "failure"                 during a 30 month follow up period. Event history analysis was                 utilized and failure was defined as a return to prison. Control                 variables used in the study included risk, a history of violence,                 IQ, reading level, education, marital status, age, and race. See                 Van Voorhis, Spruance, Ritchie, Listwan, Seabrook, and Pealer                 (2003) for a more detailed account of the measures and methodology                 of the study.               <p> <I>Study 4: </I>This study examined whether an existing offender                 typology&#151;the Jesness Inventory&#151;could differentiate among child                 molesters on such characteristics as denial, empathy, endorsement                 of cognitive distortions, and self-esteem. The study sample was                 comprised of 85 men convicted of a sexual offense against a minor;                 all were involved in correctional treatment at the time of the                 study. Each participant completed the Jesness Inventory as well                 as four other validated assessments designed to measure the dependent                 variables: Sex Offence Information Questionnaire Revised (Hogue,                 1998), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983), the Abel                 and Becker Cognitions Scale (Abel, Gore, Holland, Camp, Becker,                 and Rathner, 1989), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg,                 1965). Additional data collected from each participant's program                 file measured offender demographics, offense characteristics,                 victim characteristics, and the offender's risk of re-offending                 as measured by the Static-99 (Hanson, 1997). <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_table4.gif')">Table                 4</a> summarizes the sample characteristics. The analysis used                 analysis of variance and analysis of covariance strategies. See                 Sperber 2003 for a more detailed discussion of the methodology                 and measures used in the study.               <p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a><a name="results" id="results"></a>              <p> <B>Results</B>              <p><I>Study 1: </I>Neurotic offenders had the highest proportion                 of self-reported aggression in both the maximum custody and minimum                 custody groups. Results were significant for the minimum custody                 sample (p &lt;0.01) but not the maximum custody group. More telling,                 perhaps, were findings for stress and depression experienced shortly                 into the prison term. As shown in <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_fig1.gif')">Figure                 1</a>, neurotic offenders scored the highest on the CESD scale.                 Results were statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) for both the                 minimum custody and maximum custody groups. On other measures,                 neurotic offenders performed similar to the antisocial type, or                 were not differentiated in any meaningful way from the other three                 personality types.               <p> <I>Study 2: </I>As shown in <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_fig2.gif')">Figure                 2</a>, the findings from the discrete-time, event history analysis                 of the effect of personality on recidivism indicated that personality                 contributed to the prediction of criminal behavior even when controlling                 for race and risk. More importantly, the highest probabilities                 for rearrest were among the neurotics, followed by the antisocials,                 situationals, and dependents. The neurotics and antisocials had                 a significantly higher probability of experiencing re-arrest than                 the dependents. Furthermore, as shown in <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_fig3.gif')">Figure                 3</a>, the neurotics alone were significantly different from the                 other three types when predicting drug offenses. They were more                 likely to become involved in substance abuse than the other personality                 types, and they incurred the offenses in closer proximity to their                 release than the other offenders. Personality was not significant                 in the models predicting property or violent offenses.               <p> <I>Study 3: </I>Phase II of the Georgia Cognitive Skills Experiment                 raised the question of whether offenders' personalities affected                 how they responded to a cognitive skills program, and the question                 was answered in the affirmative. Results from discrete-time, event                 history analysis indicated that neurotics responded adversely                 to the R&amp;R program; neurotic offenders who participated in                 the program were returned to prison at significantly higher rates                 than neurotic offenders in the control group. Although only 35.3                 percent of neurotic control group members recidivated, over half                 (54.8 percent) of neurotic experimental group members were reincarcerated                 by the end of the 30-month follow up period. The neurotic X experimental                 group interaction was significant (B = 0.80; p &lt;0.05), as was                 the event history analysis model which included controls for risk                 level, history of violence, IQ, reading level, education, marital                 status, age, and race (model chi square = 103.25; p &lt;0.001).                 In contrast to the detrimental effects of the program on neurotics,                 parolees classified as antisocial, dependent, or situational improved                 slightly, though not significantly, by participating in the program                 (see Van Voorhis et al., 2002).               <p> <I>Study 4: </I>While the results of this study supported the                 hypothesis that child molesters of varied personality types would                 differ on key psychological attributes, the extent to which the                 neurotic child molesters differed from the other personality types                 was of particular interest. For example, analysis of variance                 revealed that the personality subtypes differed significantly                 on three of the dependent measures&#151;self-esteem, personal distress                 (an affective component of empathy), and fantasy (an intellectual                 component of empathy). The post hoc comparisons, outlined in <a href="javascript:popUp('images/anxiety_table5.gif')">Table                 5</a>, revealed that it was the neurotic child molester that was                 significantly different from the other three personality types.                 For example, neurotic child molesters had the highest score on                 the personal distress scale, meaning that they were the most likely                 to feel emotional discomfort in the presence of another's suffering.                 In addition, the antisocial offenders, situationals, and dependents                 scored similarly on the fantasy scale. Neurotics scored significantly                 higher, however, indicating that they were significantly more                 likely to identify with others on an intellectual level. The neurotic                 child molesters also evidenced significantly lower self-esteem                 scores than the other three groups.               <p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a><a name="conclusions" id="conclusions"></a>              <p> <B>Conclusions</B>               <p> In sum, we have accumulated evidence across four studies that                 find the neurotic group of offenders to be of particular interest                 to correctional practitioners and policy makers. They have made                 poor adjustments to prison, had the highest long-term recidivism                 rates, and appeared to have been harmed by the most prevalent                 correctional intervention in use at the present time. Moreover,                 the neurotic child molesters are different from other child molesters                 (as well as from stereotypes pertinent to child molesters) in                 ways that should factor into their treatment and therapy.               <p> These findings are important for several reasons. First, they                 offer additional support to criminologists researching individual-centered                 theories of crime. The findings are in contrast to the earlier                 reviews of personality and crime (e.g., Schuessler &amp; Cressey,                 1950; Tennenbaum, 1977; and Waldo &amp; Dinitz, 1967) and claims                 by researchers such as Vold and Bernard (1986), who argue that                 personality provides no theoretical relevance to understanding                 criminal behavior. While accumulating studies are finding a relationship                 between personality and criminal behavior, many of these studies                 are conducted with adolescents and young adults (Caspi et al.,                 1994; Caspi et al., 1997; Krueger et al., 1996). The present studies                 note consistent results with respect to adult males.               <p> Three of the studies (study 1 and 2 were of approximately the                 same sample) used different samples of offenders to explore the                 utility of the Jesness Inventory in predicting or differentiating                 offenders and their behaviors. The consistency of findings across                 different samples, added to the results of studies cited above,                 lends strong support to the external validity of findings regarding                 neurotic offenders.               <p> Accumulating research carries implications for offender risk                 assessment, correctional management, and offender programming.                 Although research by Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge (1990) and Gendreau,                 Little, &amp; Goggin (1996) find that personality is among the                 strongest predictors of criminal behavior, the "at risk"                 personality attribute typically referred to involves dimensions                 associated with antisocial ideation and psychopathy (Andrews &amp;                 Bonta, 2003) rather than anxiety or neuroticism. Moreover, risk                 assessment instruments currently in use [e.g, Salient Factor Score                 (Hoffman &amp; Beck, 1985), Level of Service Inventory-Revised                 (Andrews &amp; Bonta, 1995), and Wisconsin Risk Assessment System                 (Baird, Heinz &amp; Bemus, 1979)] typically do not include measures                 of personality. Although there are good reasons for this, particularly                 against including anxiety, evidence is accumulating that anxiety                 may be a risk factor as well as a responsivity consideration.               <p> More importantly, it may be a risk factor that is exacerbated                 by the prevailing correctional treatment modalities. To be cautious,                 this assertion is based upon only one study, whereas anxiety's                 importance as a risk factor appears across several studies. Even                 so, the finding pertaining to the cognitive skills intervention                 is of particular concern (Van Voorhis et al., 2002). Unfortunately,                 we cannot determine precisely why neurotic offenders become more                 prone to recidivism following participation in the cognitive skills                 program. It is possible that a group setting is not appropriate                 for offenders with neurotic personalities. The pressure of performing                 skills in front of peers and coaches who routinely evaluate and                 provide feedback on the use of the skills may further exacerbate                 their anxiety. Perhaps these facilitators or group members were                 too confrontational. Consideration might be given to curricular                 modifications, which could help such offenders to better deal                 with negative emotions and to develop skills for coping with anxiety-provoking                 situations. Perhaps these individuals would be better suited to                 anger management programming (e.g., see Goldstein &amp; Glick,                 1987) or to more clinical forms of intervention, but the alternatives                 have not been researched in the context that we are addressing.               <p> Concerns might also be voiced for interventions that treat sex                 offenders as if they are all alike. It is not unusual, for example,                 for a sex offender program to target denial, empathy, and victim                 awareness. However, neurotic offenders often are not in denial                 and have capacity for empathy; they simply violate their own values.                 Again, programs that utilize a certain level of confrontation                 may be detrimental to, or at least less effective, with neurotic                 child molesters. Winn (1996), for example, notes that not all                 sex offenders respond well to confrontation. We may also need                 to revisit the issue of treating the self-esteem of these individuals.                 The correctional treatment literature abounds with warnings that                 self-esteem is not a risk factor and should not be the focus of                 offender therapy. However, to our knowledge, no studies attend                 to whether it might be a risk factor for some types of offenders.                 To further complicate matters, describing these child molesters                 as being introverted, insecure, and anxious yet possessing emotional                 empathy in no way suggests that they are "lower risk"                 offenders. Many of the neurotic child molesters in this study                 had previous convictions (63 percent). More specifically, many                 of them had a previous conviction for a sex offense (48.1 percent).                 Thus, it must not have been unusual for this group to violate                 their own values, which, for the most part, were prosocial.               <p>Whatever the chosen alternatives, we are reminded poignantly                 of three assertions that emerged from the earliest research on                 neurotic offenders. First, they "do not get better on their                 own; they do need treatment" (Warren, 1983). Second, their                 antisocial behavior is amplified by anxiety-provoking situations,                 including some types of staff confrontations intended to correct                 behavior (Warren et al., 1966; Palmer, 2002). Third, when matched                 to appropriate rather than inappropriate interventions, they achieved                 more favorable results than other delinquents (Palmer, 1974);                 when they were not treated for their anxiety, their failure rate                 was atypically high. Appropriate treatment goals for these offenders                 involved reduction or resolution of internal conflicts, comfort                 with one's own needs and feelings, reductions in the inappropriate                 use of defense mechanisms, appropriate disengagement from the                 dysfunctional family problems, increased sense of self worth and                 improved capacity for enjoyment (Warren, 1983). Arguably, such                 treatment goals have not seen the light of day for a long time                 in this field.               </div>            <div class="content"><p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>            </div></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td height="25"><div class="content"><a href="references.html#anxiety">References</a>               | <a href="endnotes.html#anxiety">Endnotes</a></div></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td height="25">&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td class="bgBorder"><img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td class="footer"><sup>*</sup> These types include: (a) Unsocialized aggressive                 (Aa on the original I-level system), characterized as negative                 toward authority and family, nonconforming, aggressive, with antisocial                 values and attitudes; (b) Unsocialized passive (AP), negative                 toward authority and family, negative self-concept, nonconforming,                 isolated, and low verbal aptitude; (c) Conformist (CFM), positive                 toward authority and family, conforming, dependent, uncritical                 self-concept; (d) Cultural conformist (CFC), low motivation, negative                 toward authority and family, distrustful, alienated, antisocial                 peers and attitudes; (e) Manipulator (MP), positive self-concept,                 manipulative, obtrusive; (f) Neurotic acting-out (NA), negative                 to authority, conflicted life with family, defensive, cynical;                 (g) Neurotic Anxious (NX), conform, positive toward authority,                 anxious, and insecure; (h) Situational (SE), prosocial attitudes,                 positive self-concept, good interpersonal relationships; (i) Adaptive                 (CI), motivated, prosocial, good interpersonal relationships.		  <br><br>		  The articles and reviews that appear in <i>Federal             Probation</i> express the points of view of the persons who wrote             them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations             with which these persons are affiliated.
