         NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE

     Adopted:  January 26, 2004         Released:  January 
27, 2004

By the Commission:  Chairman Powell, Commissioners Martin 
and Adelstein issuing separate statements; Commissioner 
Copps dissenting and issuing a separate statement.

I.  INTRODUCTION

     1.   In   this  Notice   of   Apparent  Liability   For 
Forfeiture (``NAL''),  issued pursuant to Section  503(b) of 
the Communications  Act of  1934, as amended  (the ``Act''), 
and Section  1.80 of the  Commission's rules,1 we  find that 
the captioned  licensees, all  of which are  subsidiaries of 
Clear  Channel  Communications,  Inc.  (``Clear  Channel''), 
apparently  violated  18  U.S.C.  § 1464  and  47  C.F.R.  § 
73.3999,  by   willfully  and  repeatedly   airing  indecent 
material  over the  captioned stations  during the  July 19, 
November 14, 19, 26 and 27 and December 27, 2001, broadcasts 
of the  ``Bubba the Love Sponge''  program.  Furthermore, we 
find that they each appear to have failed to maintain copies 
of certain required documents in the public inspection files 
of each of their  respective captioned stations, in apparent 
willful   violation  of   Section   73.3526(e)(10)  of   the 
Commission's rules.2  Based on  the totality of the evidence 
before  us and  Clear  Channel's  history of  transgressions 
relating to the broadcast of indecent material over stations 
licensed to its subsidiaries, we conclude that Clear Channel 
is apparently liable for a monetary forfeiture in the amount 
of Seven Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand Dollars ($755,000), the 
statutory  maximum   of  $27,500   each  for   26  indecency 
violations ($715,000),  and the base amount  of $10,000 each 
for four public file violations ($40,000).

II.  BACKGROUND

     2.   This proceeding  arises out of a  series of formal 
complaints  filed on  behalf of  Douglas Vanderlaan  against 
Clear Channel alleging: (1) indecency violations; (2) public 
inspection  file violations;  (3)  improper intimidation  by 
Clear Channel against the complainant; and (4) the promotion 
and  glorification of  the  use of  illegal  drugs in  Clear 
Channel's broadcasts and on its web site.3   The Enforcement 
Bureau  (the  ``Bureau'')  issued  a series  of  letters  of 
inquiry4 and the record includes responses by Clear Channel5 
and by the complainant, to Clear Channel's responses.6 

III.  DISCUSSION

A.  Indecency Analysis

     3.  The    Federal    Communications   Commission    is 
authorized  to   license  radio  and   television  broadcast 
stations and  is responsible for enforcing  the Commission's 
rules  and applicable  statutory  provisions concerning  the 
operation  of  those  stations.  The  Commission's  role  in 
overseeing  program  content  is very  limited.   The  First 
Amendment to the United  States Constitution and Section 326 
of the  Act prohibit  the Commission from  censoring program 
material and from interfering  with broadcasters' freedom of 
expression.7   The   Commission  does,  however,   have  the 
authority  to enforce  statutory  and regulatory  provisions 
restricting indecency and obscenity.   Specifically, it is a 
violation of  federal law  to broadcast obscene  or indecent 
programming.  Title  18 of  the United States  Code, Section 
1464, prohibits the utterance  of ``any obscene, indecent or 
profane  language by  means of  radio communication.''8   In 
addition,  consistent with  a subsequent  statute and  court 
case,9 Section  73.3999 of  the Commission's  rules provides 
that  radio  and  television stations  shall  not  broadcast 
indecent material during the period 6 a.m. through 10 p.m.

     4.  As  an  initial matter,  we  find that  all of  the 
seven segments  at issue in  this NAL were  broadcast during 
this prohibited time  period, at the time of day  and on the 
specific  dates  alleged  by  Mr. Vanderlaan  in  his  First 
Complaint,  10  albeit not  by  all  four of  the  captioned 
stations.  In  this regard,  Clear Channel  has acknowledged 
that segments 1, 2 and 7 were indeed broadcast, and that the 
transcripts for  these segments submitted by  Mr. Vanderlaan 
are  accurate. 11   Clear  Channel states  that  it did  not 
retain audio  recordings or transcripts  of its own  for the 
broadcasts  encompassed  by  the remaining  three  segments, 
segments 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Consequently, as to those segments, 
Clear  Channel refuses  to ``admit  or acknowledge  that the 
material in the transcripts provided by Mr. Vanderlaan aired 
as he alleges.''12  However,  based upon the evidence before 
us, including  Clear Channel's failure to  refute adequately 
Mr. Vanderlaan's allegations, we find  that Segments 3, 4, 5 
and  6 were  also broadcast  at the  time and  on the  dates 
indicated in  the First Complaint, and  that the transcripts 
for  those segments  accurately  depict those  broadcasts.13  
Clear Channel concedes that  Stations WXTB(FM), WRLX(FM) and 
WPLA(FM)  regularly  aired  the ``Bubba  the  Love  Sponge'' 
program during the entire period  of time encompassed by all 
seven segments and  does not claim that any  of the stations 
edited  the  show.  Consequently,   we  find  that  Stations 
WXTB(FM), WRLX(FM)  and WPLA(FM) broadcast all  seven of the 
segments,  as alleged.   Clear Channel,  however, represents 
that Station WCKT(FM) did not begin carrying the ``Bubba the 
Love  Sponge'' program  until October  29, 2001.14   Because 
segments 1  and 2  were broadcast before  WCKT(FM) commenced 
airing the program, we find  that the station broadcast only 
segments 3 through 7.  

     5.  Any  consideration  of  government  action  against 
allegedly indecent  programming must  take into  account the 
fact  that   such  speech  is  protected   under  the  First 
Amendment.15   The federal  courts consistently  have upheld 
Congress's authority  to regulate the broadcast  of indecent 
material,  as  well   the  Commission's  interpretation  and 
implementation  of the  governing statute.16   Nevertheless, 
the First Amendment is  a critical constitutional limitation 
that demands  that, in indecency determinations,  we proceed 
cautiously and with appropriate restraint.17  

     6.  The  Commission defines indecent speech as language 
that, in  context, depicts or describes  sexual or excretory 
activities or organs in terms patently offensive as measured 
by  contemporary  community   standards  for  the  broadcast 
medium.18  

         Indecency   findings  involve  at   least  two 
         fundamental    determinations.    First,   the 
         material  alleged  to  be indecent  must  fall 
         within   the  subject  matter  scope   of  our 
         indecency  definition -- that is, the material 
         must  describe or  depict sexual  or excretory 
         organs  or activities.  Second, the  broadcast 
         must  be  patently  offensive as  measured  by 
         contemporary   community  standards   for  the 
         broadcast medium.19

     7.  As  an  initial matter,  all of  the seven  program 
segments, in one manner  or another, unquestionably involved 
on-air discussions relating to descriptions or depictions of 
sexual  organs,  excretory  organs and/or  activities  of  a 
sexual nature.  The broadcasts involved  conversations about 
such things  as oral sex, penises,  testicles, masturbation, 
intercourse, orgasms  and breasts.   Clear Channel  does not 
dispute that  the broadcasts  involved such  descriptions or 
depictions.20   Accordingly, we  conclude that  each of  the 
segments that  were broadcast  satisfies the first  prong of 
our indecency analysis.  

     8.  Having  satisfied the first  prong, we now  turn to 
an analysis  of whether the  material in the  seven segments 
subject  to  this NAL  satisfies  the  second prong  of  the 
Commission's two-part indecency analysis  - that is, whether 
the  broadcasts  were  patently  offensive  as  measured  by 
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.21  
In our assessment of  whether broadcast material is patently 
offensive, ``the full context in which the material appeared 
is  critically important.''22  Three  principal factors  are 
significant   to   this   contextual   analysis:   (1)   the 
explicitness  or  graphic  nature of  the  description;  (2) 
whether  the  material  dwells   on  or  repeats  at  length 
descriptions of  sexual or  excretory organs  or activities; 
and (3) whether the material appears to pander or is used to 
titillate or shock.23  In  examining these three factors, we 
must  weigh  and  balance  them  to  determine  whether  the 
broadcast  material is  patently offensive  because ``[e]ach 
indecency case presents its own particular mix of these, and 
possibly,  other  factors.''24   In  particular  cases,  the 
weight of one or two of the factors may outweigh the others, 
either rendering  the broadcast material  patently offensive 
and consequently indecent,25 or, alternatively, removing the 
broadcast material from the realm of indecency.26  

     9.  We  turn now  to an  analysis of  these factors  as 
they  relate to  each  segment,27 to  determine whether  the 
material that  was broadcast, taken in  context, is patently 
offensive  as measured  by contemporary  community standards 
for the broadcast medium. 

     Segment 1  (aired July 19,  2001 between 6:30  and 8:30 
     a.m.):28  In this segment,29  skits in which the voices 
     of purported  cartoon characters  talk about  drugs and 
     sex  are inserted  between  advertisements for  Cartoon 
     Network's Friday night cartoons  that are identified as 
     ``provocative adult cartoons to help you get your freak 
     on.''  The  first skit begins when  Shaggy tells Scooby 
     Doo that he needs crack cocaine but has no money to buy 
     it.    Scooby   Doo    responds   that   Shaggy   could 
     ``su(bleep)ck d(bleep)ick''  to pay for the  drugs.  In 
     the next skit, Fat Albert, a/k/a Phat Diddy Daddy, gets 
     killed  in  a  drive-by shooting  after  bragging  that 
     Jennifer  Lopez had  been  ``s(bleep)ing Diddy  Daddy's 
     (bleep)ck the  previous night.   The third  skit begins 
     with the theme music from ``The Jetsons'' cartoon show.  
     George  Jetson  then begins  telling  Jane  that he  no 
     longer needs Viagra because he got a ``Spacely Sprocket 
     (bleep)ck  ring.''   After  George flips  a  switch  to 
     activate the  device, sound  effects indicate  that the 
     device  malfunctions, and  the  skit  ends with  George 
     calling for Jane  to turn off the  device.  Next, Alvin 
     the Chipmunk  complains that  he hasn't ``been  laid in 
     almost six weeks.''  Another chipmunk responds that his 
     problem is  due to  the ``f(bleep)cking pussy  music we 
     play''  and begins  to sing  a more  ``kick ass''  song 
     directing a ``filthy chipmunk-whore'' to ``[s]uck on my 
     (inaudible)  Chipmunk (bleep)s,''  ``[p]ut `em  in your 
     mouth and  (bleep)uck `em.''   He continues  by singing 
     ``They taste like pistachios.   They're warm and fuzzy. 
     Suck my (bleep).''  The song  is interrupted by a final 
     advertisement for ``Cartoons with Balls.''

     This segment contains sufficiently graphic and explicit 
     references   to  sexual   and   excretory  organs   and 
     activities  to  satisfy  the  first  criterion  of  our 
     contextual analysis.  Such  sexual references are found 
     in each  of the skits  and are repeated  throughout the 
     segment, satisfying the second factor of our contextual 
     analysis.  Finally,  the use  of cartoon  characters in 
     such a sexually explicit manner during hours of the day 
     when children  are likely  to be listening  is shocking 
     and  makes  this  segment patently  offensive.   It  is 
     foreseeable that  young children would  be particularly 
     attentive  listeners to  this  segment  because of  the 
     character voices  and the  cartoon theme music  used in 
     the segment.   The calculated and callous nature of the 
     stations' decision to impose this predictably offensive 
     material   upon   young,    vulnerable   listeners   is 
     particularly  compelling  and  weighs  heavily  in  our 
     analysis.  Thus,  the segment also satisfies  the third 
     factor of our  contextual analysis.  Consequently, this 
     segment is apparently indecent.      

     Segment 2 (July 19, 2001,  between 6:30 and 8:14 a.m.):  
     In this  segment,30 a  male applicant for  a job  as an 
     underwear  model calls  the  model  search hotline  and 
     describes  his as  the ``perfect  penis,'' so  gorgeous 
     that  ``[e]very f(bleep)ing,  every --  every ounce  of 
     f(bleep)cking  co(bleep)  purple  (inaudible)  of  it'' 
     ``should be hanging in  the f(bleep)cking Louvre,'' and 
     so strong  that it can  lift a 25-pound weight  and can 
     split his  pants like the Incredible  Hulk.  Such vivid 
     descriptions of  the caller's  penis satisfy  the first 
     criterion  of  our  contextual  analysis.   The  entire 
     segment   discusses  the   man's  penis,   and  graphic 
     descriptions  of  it   are  referenced  throughout  the 
     segment.  Thus, the second  criterion of the contextual 
     analysis is also satisfied.   The sole purpose of these 
     vivid descriptions apparently is to shock and titillate 
     listeners.  Thus, the third criterion of our contextual 
     analysis  is satisfied.   Because this  segment repeats 
     graphic and explicit descriptions  of a sexual organ in 
     an  effort to  titillate  listeners, it  appears to  be 
     patently offensive and indecent.

     Segment  3 (November  14, 2001,  between 7:00  and 8:55 
     a.m.):  In this segment,31 one of the men participating 
     in  the  on-air  discussion is  Ned,  a  self-described 
     ``loud masturbator.''  He views the act of masturbating 
     in public as a performance  and states that he looks as 
     though he's having a ``grand mal seizure'' when he does 
     it.   When  asked to  do  so  by  the host,  Ned,  with 
     increasing  drum  beat  rhythms  as  an  accompaniment, 
     reenacts masturbating and reaching orgasm.  Despite the 
     use of euphemisms such as ``wax[ing] your carrot'' when 
     referring   to   masturbation,  and   ``sparky''   when 
     referring  to a  penis,  the sexual  references in  the 
     segment are  unmistakable and sufficiently  explicit to 
     satisfy the first criteria  of our contextual analysis.  
     The entire  segment dwells  at length  on masturbation.  
     Thus, the  second criterion of our  contextual analysis 
     is   also   satisfied.   Finally,   the   participants' 
     discussions of masturbating  styles and techniques, and 
     Ned's simulation  of such a  sex act, make  it apparent 
     that the  segment was used  to titillate and  shock the 
     program's  listeners.    In  doing  so,   this  segment 
     satisfies  the   third  criterion  of   our  contextual 
     analysis.   Accordingly,  we  find  that  this  segment 
     appears to be patently offensive and indecent. 

     Segment  4 (November  19, 2001,  between 8:00  and 9:00 
     a.m.):   In this  segment,32  three  males interview  a 
     female   caller   about   her  sexual   exploits   with 
     ``Spider,'' another  man.  They  discuss the  length of 
     Spider's  penis,  the  length   of  time  their  sexual 
     encounter lasted, and the  sexual techniques they used.  
     After the  caller indicated  that she had  given Spider 
     oral sex, one  host responded that he  hoped Spider had 
     not given her oral sex because heavier women, like her, 
     have ``some cheese down  there.''  The hosts then began 
     ridiculing the  caller about  her size and  asked ``Are 
     you like a  Ball Park Plank -- Frank,  you p[l]ump when 
     we bang  ya?''  The conversation between  the hosts and 
     the  caller was  sufficiently explicit  and graphic  to 
     convey   unmistakably  the   sexual   meaning  of   the 
     euphemisms they used and to satisfy the first criterion 
     of our contextual analysis.  The participants talked at 
     length  about  sexual   and  excretory  activities  and 
     organs.   It was apparent that  the purpose of the call 
     was to discuss the sexual  organs and activities of the 
     caller and  Spider.  As  a consequence,  the discussion 
     dwelled  upon   the  subjects  of  sexual   organs  and 
     activities, and,  thus, satisfies the  second criterion 
     of our  contextual analysis.   Finally, it  is apparent 
     that the  discussion was titillating and  shocking with 
     respect to the audience.   Thus, this segment meets the 
     third and  final criterion of our  contextual analysis.  
     As a consequence,  we find that the  segment appears to 
     be patently offensive and indecent.

     Segment  5 (November  26, 2001,  between 7:00  and 9:00 
     a.m.):  In  this segment,33  a male  host and  two male 
     cohorts interview or talk with two female studio guests 
     who are participants in a contest to win breast implant 
     surgery.   The host  takes  pictures of  the women  and 
     directs and describes their  poses, e.g., directing one 
     to let  him ``get a  little more ass,'' in  the picture 
     and, later, to pose so that he can take a ``front panty 
     shot.''  A discussion of oral  sex begins when the host 
     tells Hillary, one of  the women, that long fingernails 
     like hers  ``feel so  good on my  boys,'' and  that his 
     genital area  is shaved.  In response,  Hillary states, 
     ``That's  good.   No  --  no hairs  in  the  teeth  and 
     stuff.''  She then discusses her preference for giving, 
     rather than  getting, oral sex and  declares herself to 
     be  a ``big  oral queen''  who could  ``go a  half-hour 
     solid,''  before   her  ``cheeks  would   hurt.''   She 
     discusses  her  sexual  escapades  with  two  men,  her 
     inability   to   reach    orgasm   and   her   frequent 
     masturbation.  During  the ensuing discussion  the host 
     encourages  Hillary  to  masturbate  on  air  while  he 
     watches and gives a ``play by play.''  To encourage her 
     to  cooperate, he  tells her  that masturbating  on air 
     would increase  her chances of winning  breast implants 
     and, when she continues to  refuse, he proposes that he 
     or the  other female guest  give her manual  sex during 
     the broadcast.

     The  graphic and  explicit  descriptions  of sexual  or 
     excretory  organs  and  activities  contained  in  this 
     segment satisfy  the first criterion of  our contextual 
     analysis.   The repetition  of  these descriptions  and 
     other sexual references  throughout the segment satisfy 
     the second  criterion of our contextual  analysis.  The 
     continued  and  repeated  explicit and  graphic  sexual 
     references   clearly  demonstrate   the  shocking   and 
     titillating nature of the material, thus satisfying the 
     third   criterion    of   our    contextual   analysis.  
     Consequently, we  find that this segment  appears to be 
     patently offensive and indecent. 

     Segment  6 (November  27, 2001,  between 7:30  and 9:00 
     a.m.):  In  this segment,34 a  male host and  a co-host 
     interview two female studio guests who are participants 
     in  the ``Twelve  Boobs of  Christmas'' contest  to win 
     breast implant  surgery.  The  segment begins  with the 
     host taking  pictures of the contestants'  ``boobs'' in 
     order to ``facilitate you  on some new boobies, baby.''  
     He then begins asking about their sexual activities and 
     is impressed that one of  the women, when giving ``oral 
     sex,'' does not ``recycle,'' or ``waste a drop.''  This 
     segment is  sufficiently explicit  and graphic  to meet 
     criteria one  of our contextual analysis.   Because the 
     sexual   descriptions  and   references  are   repeated 
     throughout the segment, criterion two of our contextual 
     analysis  is  also  satisfied.  Finally,  these  sexual 
     references and  discussions appear to be  inserted only 
     to titillate  the audience.   Thus, criterion  three of 
     our contextual analysis is  also met.  Consequently, we 
     find that this segment appears to be patently offensive 
     and indecent.

     Segment  7 (December  27, 2001,  between 8:00  and 9:00 
     a.m.):     In this  segment,35 Bubba  and two  male co-
     hosts  discuss   the  abnormally  large  size   of  his 
     ``balls,''  while a  singer and  chorus sing  about his 
     testicles   in  explicit   and  graphic   detail.   The 
     euphemism, ``balls,'' is a  common one, generally known 
     to mean testicles, a  sexual organ.  Descriptions, such 
     as those stating that  Bubba's ``balls,'' which are the 
     size of ``cantaloupes'' or ``coconuts,'' are ``firm and 
     meaty''  with   ``ingrown  hairs,''   are  sufficiently 
     graphic to  meet the  first contextual  criteria.  Such 
     descriptions are  repeated at length during  the entire 
     segment,  satisfying the  second contextual  criterion.  
     Finally, the material satisfies  the third criterion of 
     our  contextual  analysis   because  it  is  pandering, 
     titillating  and shocking  to the  program's listeners.  
     Thus, we find that this  segment appears to be patently 
     offensive and indecent.

     10. Based  on the foregoing, we find  that the material 
that  was broadcast  in these  seven segments  satisfies the 
second prong of our two-part test and, thus, appear patently 
offensive, as  measured by contemporary  community standards 
for the broadcast medium.  Because we have found these seven 
segments to have apparently satisfied both prongs of our two 
part  test,   we  conclude  that  the   material   contained 
apparently indecent speech.  

     11. Each  of the segments was broadcast  between 6 a.m. 
to 10 p.m., at a time  of day when the broadcast of indecent 
material is explicitly prohibited  by Section 73.3999 of the 
Commission's rules.   Because these segments appear  to have 
contained indecent speech and were broadcast at times of the 
day  when  indecent  speech   is  proscribed,  each  of  the 
broadcasts  appears to  be legally  actionable.36  We  find, 
therefore, that  three of  the captioned  stations (Stations 
WXTB(FM),  WRLX(FM)  and   WPLA(FM))  each  broadcast  seven 
apparently  indecent  segments,37  in apparent  willful  and 
repeated violation  of Title  18 U.S.C.  § 1464  and Section 
73.3999 of the Commission's  rules.  In addition, the fourth 
captioned station  (Station WCKT(FM)), which  began carrying 
the  ``Bubba the  Love  Sponge'' program  subsequent to  the 
other stations,  broadcast five  of the  apparently indecent 
segments (Segments  3, 4,  5, 6 and  7),38 also  in apparent 
willful and repeated violation of Title 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and 
Section 73.3999 of the Commission's rules.39  

B.  Public Inspection File

     12. Section  73.3526(e)(10) of  the Commission's  rules 
requires broadcast licensees to maintain a public inspection 
file  containing  specific  types of  information.   Section 
73.3526(e)(10) specifies that, among the documents that must 
be included in the file,  is ``material having a substantial 
bearing  on  a  matter  which  is  the  subject  of  an  FCC 
investigation  or  complaint to  the  FCC  . .  .''40   Such 
material must  be retained in a  station's public inspection 
file   pending  written   notification   that   it  may   be 
discarded.41  Where  lapses occur in maintaining  the public 
inspection file, neither the negligent acts nor omissions of 
station  employees or  agents, nor  the subsequent  remedial 
actions  undertaken by  the  licensee, excuse  or nullify  a 
licensee's rule violation.42 

     13. It  is  beyond dispute  that, on  August 22,  2001, 
each of the four captioned stations failed to include copies 
of documents relating to Mr. Vanderlaan's First Complaint in 
its  public inspection  file.  In  declarations accompanying 
the Second Complaint, Mr.  Vanderlaan, Dr. David D. Swanson, 
Kathy  Taunton and  Sally Oesch  each states  that, on  that 
date, he or she visited one of the captioned stations during 
normal business hours, reviewed  its public inspection file, 
and determined that  the file did not contain a  copy of the 
First Complaint or any  documents related to it.43  Although 
Clear Channel does not  dispute these allegations, it argues 
that Station  WXTB(FM) should  be relieved of  liability for 
its failure  to have maintained  the First Complaint  in its 
public inspection  file because a  copy of the  document was 
located  elsewhere in  the station  after the  requester had 
specifically identified  and requested it.44   This argument 
lacks merit.  The Commission requires that such documents be 
maintained in  the public  inspection file. 45   The obvious 
intent of  the rule is  to facilitate public access  to such 
documents.  To require an individual member of the public to 
examine a station's public inspection file and then identify 
for station  personnel what  is missing  from it  clearly is 
inconsistent with the intent of the rule section.  

     14. Based  on the information  before us, we  find that 
the  captioned   licensees  at  each  of   their  respective 
captioned  stations  failed  to  maintain  certain  required 
documents in  their respective  public inspection  files, in 
apparent willful violation of  Section 73.3526(e)(10) of the 
Commission's rules.

C.  Other Allegations

     15. In  his  First  Complaint, Mr.  Vanderlaan  alleges 
that  Clear  Channel  engaged in  intimidating  and  abusive 
conduct  after he  had filed  his First  Complaint with  the 
Commission,  by  threatening  him   with  legal  action  and 
complaining    to   his    employer.46     A   finding    of 
``[i]ntimidation or harassment of witnesses requires threats 
of reprisals  or some other unnecessary  and abusive conduct 
reasonably calculated to dissuade  a witness from continuing 
his or her  involvement in a proceeding.''47   In this case, 
Mr. Vanderlaan presents no evidence to corroborate his claim 
that Clear Channel contacted  his employer and provides only 
a copy  of his attorney's  response to a  letter purportedly 
from the attorney  for Todd ``Bubba'' Clem (the  host of the 
program)  to   corroborate  his   allegation  that   he  was 
threatened with legal action by Clear Channel.  In fact, Mr. 
Vanderlaan presents no evidence that the captioned licensees 
or Clear Channel  made, or were even aware  of, the contacts 
about   which   he   complains.   Consequently,   there   is 
insufficient  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  Clear 
Channel or  the captioned licensees engaged  in intimidation 
or abuse.  Accordingly, we find no merit to this allegation.

     16. In  both his  First Complaint  and Third  Complaint 
and Supplement,  Mr. Vanderlaan  alleges that  Clear Channel 
promotes the  use of  illegal drugs.48  Consistent  with the 
Commission's  limited  role overseeing  programming  content 
mandated  by the  First  Amendment and  Section  326 of  the 
Act,49 there  is no  rule or  statutory provision  barring a 
licensee from airing material referencing drug use.50  Thus, 
the  allegations concerning  this  material  do not  warrant  
enforcement action.

IV.  PROPOSED FORFEITURE

     17. Having  determined  that  the  captioned  licensees 
apparently willfully and/or repeatedly  violated 18 U.S.C. § 
1464  and   Sections  73.3999  and  73.3526(e)(10)   of  the 
Commission's rules, we  turn to an analysis  of whether, and 
to  what  extent,  we   should  propose  sanctions  in  this 
instance.  Under Section 503(b)(1)  of the Act,51 any person 
who is  determined by  the Commission  to have  willfully or 
repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or 
any  rule, regulation,  or  order issued  by the  Commission 
shall  be  liable to  the  United  States for  a  forfeiture 
penalty.52   In  order  to   impose  such  a   penalty,  the 
Commission must  issue a  notice of apparent  liability, the 
notice must  be received,  and the  person against  whom the 
notice has been issued must  have an opportunity to show, in 
writing,  why  no such  penalty  should  be imposed.53   The 
Commission will  then issue  a forfeiture if  it finds  by a 
preponderance of  the evidence that the  person has violated 
the Act or a Commission rule, regulation or order.54 

     18. In  the instant case, we have determined that three 
of the  captioned stations (Stations WXTB(FM),  WRLX(FM) and 
WPLA(FM)) each broadcast  seven apparently indecent segments 
of  the  ``Bubba  the  Love Sponge''  program,  in  apparent 
willful and repeated violation of Title 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and 
Section  73.3999 of  the  Commission's rules,  and that  the 
remaining captioned station  (Station WCKT(FM)), which began 
carrying  the ``Bubba  the Love  Sponge'' program  after the 
other stations, broadcast five apparently indecent segments, 
in  apparent  willful and  repeated  violation  of Title  18 
U.S.C. § 1464 and Section 73.3999 of the Commission's rules.  
Stated otherwise,  we conclude that the  captioned licensees 
apparently violated 18 U.S.C. §  1464 and Section 73.3999 of 
the Commission's rules on a  total of 26 separate occasions.    
Consequently, based  upon our review  of the record  in this 
case, we conclude that Clear  Channel, as the parent of each 
licensee, is apparently liable for forfeitures based upon 26 
willful and repeated violations of our indecency rules.55

     19. The  Commission's Forfeiture Policy  Statement sets 
a base forfeiture  amount of $7,000 for  the transmission of 
indecent material.56   The Forfeiture Policy  Statement also 
specifies  that the  Commission  shall  adjust a  forfeiture 
based  upon  consideration  of  the  factors  enumerated  in 
Section 503(b)(2)(D)  of the Act, 47  U.S.C. § 503(b)(2)(D), 
such as  ``the nature, circumstances, extent  and gravity of 
the violation, and, with respect to the violator, the degree 
of culpability,  any history  of prior offenses,  ability to 
pay, and such other matters as justice may require.''57

     20. Based  upon our review of the record  before us, we 
believe that  an upward adjustment to  the statutory maximum 
of $27,500 for each of  the 26 apparent indecency violations 
is warranted.  The large number of apparent violations here, 
combined  with Clear  Channel's repeated  broadcasts in  the 
past of apparently indecent  material over multiple stations 
licensed  to  its  subsidiaries,   evidences  a  pattern  of 
violations  that  justifies  a proposed  forfeiture  of  the 
statutory maximum.58    

     21. Because  we find  that Clear  Channel, through  its 
subsidiary captioned licensee companies, apparently violated 
18 U.S.C.  § 1464  and Section  73.3999 of  the Commission's 
rules on 26 separate occasions, and that each such violation 
is  subject  to an  apparent  forfeiture  in the  amount  of 
$27,500, we conclude that Clear Channel is apparently liable 
for a forfeiture in the amount of $715,000 for willfully and 
repeatedly  broadcasting  indecent material  during  various 
segments of the  ``Bubba the Love Sponge''  program over the 
captioned   stations.   Particularly   in  light   of  Clear 
Channel's history  of violations of the  indecency rules, we 
also  take   this  opportunity   to  reiterate   our  recent 
admonition  (which took  place after  the behavior  at issue 
here) that serious multiple violations of our indecency rule 
by broadcasters may well lead to the commencement of license 
revocation  proceedings.59   We   expect  Clear  Channel  in 
particular to take this admonition seriously. 

     22. We  also have  previously determined that  the four 
captioned  stations  failed  to  maintain  certain  required 
documents in  their respective  public inspection  files, in 
apparent willful violation of  Section 73.3526(e)(10) of the 
Commission's rules.   Based upon the factors  articulated in 
Section  503(b)(2)(D) of  the  Act and  the base  forfeiture 
amount  specified in  the  Forfeiture  Policy Statement  for 
violations  of  the our  public  inspection  file rules,  we 
conclude that a proposed forfeiture is warranted in the base 
forfeiture amount of  $10,000 for each of  the four apparent 
willful   violations  of   Section  73.3526(e)(10)   of  the 
Commission's rules, for a total of $40,000.

V.  ORDERING CLAUSES

     23. ACCORDINGLY,  IT  IS ORDERED,  pursuant to  Section 
503(b) of  the Communications Act  of 1934, as  amended, and 
Section 1.80 of the Commission's rules,60 that Clear Channel 
Communications,  Inc., the  parent  company of  each of  the 
above-captioned  licensees,   is  hereby  NOTIFIED   of  its 
APPARENT  LIABILITY FOR  FORFEITURE in  the total  amount of 
Seven  Hundred Fifty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($755,000), for 
willfully violating  18 U.S.C.  § 1464 and  Sections 73.3999 
and 73.3526(e)(10) of the Commission's rules.61

     24.   IT IS FURTHER  ORDERED, pursuant to  Section 1.80 
of the Commission's  rules, that within thirty  (30) days of 
the release  of this  Notice, Clear  Channel Communications, 
Inc. SHALL  PAY the full  amount of the  proposed forfeiture 
against  it  or  SHALL  FILE  a  written  statement  seeking 
reduction or cancellation of the proposed forfeiture.

     25. Payment  of the forfeiture may be made by mailing a 
check or  similar instrument,  payable to  the order  of the 
Federal   Communications  Commission,   to  the   Forfeiture 
Collection Section,  Finance Branch,  Federal Communications 
Commission,  P.O. Box  73482, Chicago,  Illinois 60673-7482.  
The  payment  MUST  INCLUDE  the  FCC  Registration  Numbers 
(``FRN'')  referenced   above  and  also  should   note  the 
NAL/Account Number referenced above.

     26. The  response, if any, must be mailed to William H. 
Davenport,  Chief,  Investigations  and  Hearings  Division, 
Enforcement Bureau,  Federal Communications  Commission, 445 
12th  Street, S.W,  Room 3-B443,  Washington D.C.  20554 and 
MUST INCLUDE the NAL/Acct. No. referenced above.

     27. The   Commission  will  not  consider  reducing  or 
canceling a forfeiture  in response to a  claim of inability 
to  pay  unless  the  respondent submits:  (1)  federal  tax 
returns for the most recent three-year period; (2) financial 
statements   prepared   according  to   generally   accepted 
accounting practices (``GAAP''); or  (3) some other reliable 
and  objective documentation  that  accurately reflects  the 
respondent's  current   financial  status.   Any   claim  of 
inability to  pay must  specifically identify the  basis for 
the  claim  by  reference  to  the  financial  documentation 
submitted.

     28. Requests  for payment  of the  full amount  of this 
Notice  of  Apparent  Liability under  an  installment  plan 
should be sent to: Chief, Revenue and Receivables Operations 
Group, 445 12th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.62 

     29. Under  the Small  Business Paperwork Relief  Act of 
2002, Pub L. No. 107-198, 116 Stat. 729 (June 28, 2002), the 
FCC is engaged in a  two-year tracking process regarding the 
size of entities involved  in forfeitures.  If Clear Channel 
qualifies as a  small entity and if it wishes  to be treated 
as  a  small entity  for  tracking  purposes, it  should  so 
certify to us within thirty (30) days of this NAL, either in 
its response to  the NAL or in a separate  filing to be sent 
to   the   Investigations   and  Hearings   Division.    The 
certification   should  indicate   whether  Clear   Channel, 
including its  parent entity and its  subsidiaries, meet one 
of the  definitions set  forth in the  list provided  by the 
FCC's  Office   of  Communications   Business  Opportunities 
(``OCBO'')  set forth  in  Attachment B  of  this Notice  of 
Apparent  Liability.   This  information will  be  used  for 
tracking purposes only.  Clear Channel's response or failure 
to  respond to  this question  will  have no  effect on  its 
rights and  responsibilities pursuant  to Section  503(b) of 
the  Communications Act.   If  Clear  Channel has  questions 
regarding any of the  information contained in Attachment B, 
it should contact OCBO at (202) 418-0990.

     30. Accordingly,   IT  IS   ORDERED,  that   the  First 
Complaint,   Second  Complaint   and  Third   Complaint  and 
Supplement filed  by Douglas  Vanderlaan ARE GRANTED  to the 
extent indicated  herein, AND ARE OTHERWISE  DENIED, and the 
complaint proceeding IS HEREBY TERMINATED.

     31. IT  IS FURTHER ORDERED, that copies  of this Notice 
of  Apparent  Liability For  Forfeiture  shall  be sent,  by 
Certified Mail  Return Receipt Requested, to  Mr. Kenneth E. 
Wyker,  Senior  Vice  President  &  General  Counsel,  Clear 
Channel Communications,  Inc., c/o Clear  Channel Worldwide, 
200 East Basse  Road, San Antonio, Texas  78209-8328, with a 
copy to Clear  Channel's counsel, John M.  Burgett, Esq., at

Washington, D.C., 20006, and to Mr. Douglas Vanderlaan, 8114 
Parkridge Circle South, Jacksonville,  Florida 32211, with a 
copy to his counsel, Arthur V. Belendiuk, Esq., at Smithwick

Re:  Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc., Licensee of

Charlotte, Florida (Formerly Station WRLR(FM)); Citicasters 
Licenses, L.P., Licensee of Station WXTB(FM), Clearwater,

     Seven broadcasts, twenty-six indecency violations, four 
public file violations and fines equaling $755,000.  By 
today's action, we provide yet another example of this 
Commission's commitment to enforce its rules and 
regulations¾especially as it relates to indecent programming 
engulfing our broadcast airwaves.

     As the Commission with the strongest enforcement record 
in decades, it should come as little surprise that this 
Commission's indecency enforcement has dwarfed its 
predecessors.  I am proud of the fact that over the past 
three years, we have proposed nearly twice the dollar amount 
of indecency fines than the previous two Commissions 
combined (over seven years) and ten times the amount of 
fines proposed by the last Commission.

     Now is not, however, a time to rest on our laurels and 
no broadcaster should believe that we will.  Indeed, due to 
the leadership on this issue from Commissioner Martin, the 
Commission will soon begin considering fines for each 
separate utterance found indecent in a broadcast.  In 
addition, we will continue to look to Congress to 
dramatically increase the enforcement penalties available to 
us to prosecute clear indecency violations.  I applaud 
Chairman Upton, Chairman Tauzin, Congressmen Dingell and 
Markey, Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings and the many 
others on both sides of the aisle in Congress for providing 
vital leadership on this issue.  

     As the Commission continues the challenging task of 
balancing the protections of the First Amendment with the 
need to protect our young, these increased enforcement 
actions will allow the Commission to turn what is now a 
``cost of doing business'' into a significant ``cost for 
doing indecent business.''


                    SEPARATE STATEMENT OF 
               COMMISSIONER MICHAEL J. COPPS,
                         DISSENTING

Re: Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc., Licensee of 
Stations WPLA(FM), Callahan, Florida, and WCKT(FM), Port 
Charlotte, Florida (Formerly Station WRLR(FM)); Citicasters 
Licenses, L.P., Licensee of Station WXTB(FM), Clearwater, 
Florida; Capstar TX Limited Partnership, Licensee of Station 
WRLX(FM), West Palm Beach, Florida, Notice of Apparent 
Liability for Forfeiture

     In this case, four Clear Channel stations aired on 
several occasions graphic and explicit sexual content as 
entertainment.  The extreme nature of these broadcasts and 
the fact that the show at issue has been the subject of 
repeated indecency actions gives the FCC the obligation to 
take serious action.  Instead, the majority proposes a mere 
$27,500 fine for each incident.  Such a fine will be easily 
absorbed as a ``cost of doing business'' and fails to send a 
message that the Commission is serious about enforcing the 
nation's indecency laws.  ``Cost of doing business fines'' 
are never going to stop the media's slide to the bottom.

     To fulfill our duty under the law, I believe the 
Commission should have designated these cases for a hearing 
on the revocation of these stations' licenses, as provided 
for by Section 312(a)(6) of the Communications Act.  I am 
discouraged that my colleagues would not join me in taking a 
firm stand against indecency on the airwaves.  

     If the Commission can't bring itself to go to a 
revocation hearing, at least the Commission should have used 
its current statutory authority to impose a higher and 
meaningful fine.  The Commission could have proposed a fine 
for each separate ``utterance'' that was indecent, rather 
than one fine for each lengthy segment.  As Commissioner 
Martin points out, such an approach would have led to a 
significantly higher fine.  

     Here, four Clear Channel stations ran several segments 
of the ``Bubba the Love Sponge'' show which contained 
graphic and explicit sexual content.  The majority admits 
that each of these stations appears to have egregiously and 
extensively violated the statutory ban on broadcast of 
indecent material numerous times.  But then the majority 
inexplicably determines that the appropriate recourse for 
this filth is a $27,500 fine for each violation.  

     The majority states that, in light of Clear Channel's 
history of violations of the indecency rules, other serious 
multiple violations ``may well lead to license revocation 
proceedings.''  The majority fails to acknowledge that not 
just Clear Channel, but the ``Bubba the Love Sponge'' show, 
has been the subject of at least three previous fines for 
violating our nation's indecency laws.  This is not even 
``three strikes and you are out'' enforcement.  How many 
strikes are we going to give them?

     This case may well lead broadcasters to believe that 
this Commission will never use the enforcement authority it 
currently has available to it.  The message to licensees is 
clear.  Even egregious repeated violations will not result 
in revocation of a license.  Rather, they will result only 
in a financial penalty that is merely a cost of doing 
business. 
      
     The time has come for this Commission to take a firm 
stand against the ``race to the bottom'' as the level of 
discourse on the public's airwaves gets progressively 
coarser and more violent.  Our enforcement actions should 
convince broadcasters that they cannot ignore their 
responsibility to serve the public interest and to protect 
children.  The FCC's action today fails to do so.
                    SEPARATE STATEMENT OF 
                COMMISSIONER KEVIN J. MARTIN

Re:  Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc., Licensee of 
     Station WPLA(FM), Callahan, Florida, WCKT(FM), Port 
     Charlotte, Florida; Citicasters Licenses, L.P., 
     Licensee of Station WXTB(FM), Clearwater, Florida; 
     Capstar TX Limited Partnership, Licensee of Station 
     WRLX(FM), West Palm Beach, Florida, Notice of Apparent 
     Liability for Forfeiture

     I agree with this Notice's conclusion that the 
licensees at issue apparently violated our indecency rule 
and public file requirements. 

     I write separately to emphasize again that we could, 
and should, be placing higher fines on those who broadcast 
indecent programming during the hours when children may be 
watching or listening, in violation of our rules and 
statute.  The governing statute targets ``whoever utters'' 
indecent or profane language, and the Commission should not 
continue to treat an entire program full of indecent 
``utterances'' as just one violation.63  We should not 
continue to give a broadcaster who violates our indecency 
rule at the beginning of a program a ``free pass'' for the 
next two hours.  

     In this case, I would have found numerous violations, 
for a total indecency fine significantly higher than that 
proposed (it appears there were at least 49 indecency 
violations, for a total forfeiture exceeding $1,000,000).

                    SEPARATE STATEMENT OF 
             COMMISSIONER JONATHAN S. ADELSTEIN

Re:  Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc., Notice of 
Apparent Liability for Forfeiture

     The Commission has a duty to enforce statutory and 
regulatory provisions restricting broadcast indecency.  The 
material broadcast by these four Clear Channel radio 
stations is undeniably graphic and explicit in its sexual 
content and clearly intended to shock listeners.  Clear 
Channel and, indeed, this particular ``Bubba the Love 
Sponge'' program have been the subject of repeated 
Commission indecency actions in the past.  Given the 
explicit nature of the broadcast material and the history of 
prior offenses, this is the type of serious repeated 
behavior that I believe would warrant initiation of license 
revocation hearings.  

     In fairness, however, this material was broadcast in 
2001.  The Commission clarified in an April 2003 order that 
it was broadening its range of enforcement approaches and 
tools to combat indecency on our nation's public airwaves.  
For this reason, I approve of today's Order as legally 
appropriate.  The egregious nature of the material clearly 
warrants the statutory maximum $27,500 fine per violation.  
While the Commission at all times has the authority to 
initiate license revocation hearings or sanction for 
multiple indecent utterances in a given program segment, it 
can be argued that the Commission was not employing these 
approaches at the time this material was broadcast.  
Nonetheless, as we made clear last year, broadcasters are 
now aware that the Commission will not hesitate to use its 
full range of enforcement sanctions for indecent material 
broadcast after April 2003.  

     I also acknowledge the importance of broadcasters 
adhering to the public inspection file rules.  Documents 
pertaining to an FCC investigation are clearly within the 
scope of the information that must be maintained in a manner 
accessible to the listening public.  In this case, each of 
the stations inexplicably failed to include complaints 
related to the airing of this material in their public 
files.    

     A broadcast license is a public privilege.  In return, 
broadcasters have a responsibility to serve the public.  
This public interest responsibility clearly encompasses 
protecting children from indecency on the airwaves and 
facilitating public access to documentation through which 
the station can remain accountable to its local community 
and listening public.  These stations exhibited a blatant 
disregard for both.

FCC  Rcd  21828  (MMB 1997)  (forfeiture  paid))  (extremely 
graphic  or  explicit  nature  of  references  to  sex  with 
children outweighed the fleeting  nature of the references);

(forfeiture paid) (same)). 

26  Id.  at  8010, ¶  20  (``the  manner  and purpose  of  a 
presentation  may well  preclude an  indecency determination 
even though other factors, such as explicitness, might weigh 
in favor of an indecency finding'').

27 See Attachment A passim.

28 The  complainant's transcript reflects bleeps  of certain 
offensive words.   A review of the  relevant tapes indicates 
that the letters  before the word ``(bleep)''  in many cases 
were  aired.   However,  although  the  transcript  suggests 
otherwise, a review of the  relevant tape indicates that the 
letters after the word  ``(bleep)'' were completely bleeped.  
In any event,  our indecency finding is not  based on airing 
of the specific bleeped words.

38 Id.

39  The   First  Complaint  also  included   allegations  of 
indecency with  respect to  three other  broadcast segments.  
We  conclude that  these  broadcasts  were not  sufficiently 
graphic and/or  sustained to be considered  indecent and are 
denying the First Complaint with respect to these segments.

43 Second Complaint at Exhibits 1, 4.  In the Declaration of 
Ms. Taunton,  who attempted  to inspect the  WXTB(FM) public 
file, she states that, after  specifically asking to see the 
First   Complaint,  ``[a]   copy   of   the  Complaint   was 
subsequently found in the  station manager's office and made 
available for my review.'' Id. at Exhibit 3.  However, it is 
clear that, had Ms. Taunton not been aware of that document, 
she would not have learned of  it from her inspection of the 
file, the purpose behind the requirement that it be included 
in the file.

52 47  U.S.C. §  503(b)(1)(B); 47  C.F.R. §  1.80(a)(1); see 
also 47 U.S.C. §  503(b)(1)(D) (forfeitures for violation of 
14 U.S.C.  § 1464).   Section 312(f)(1)  of the  Act defines 
willful  as ``the  conscious  and  deliberate commission  or 
omission  of  [any]  act,  irrespective  of  any  intent  to 
violate'' the  law.  47 U.S.C. §  312(f)(1). The legislative 
history to Section 312(f)(1) of  the Act clarifies that this 
definition  of  willful applies  to  both  Sections 312  and 
503(b) of the Act, H.R. Rep. No. 97-765, 97th Cong. 2d Sess. 
51 (1982), and the Commission has so interpreted the term in 
the  Section 503(b)  context.   See,  e.g., Application  for 
Review of  Southern California Broadcasting  Co., Memorandum 
Opinion and Order,  6 FCC Rcd 4387,  4388 (1991) (``Southern 
California  Broadcasting Co.'').   The  Commission may  also 
assess a forfeiture for violations that are merely repeated, 
and  not willful.   See,  e.g.,  Callais Cablevision,  Inc., 
Grand  Isle, Louisiana,  Notice  of  Apparent Liability  for 
Monetary  Forfeiture,  16 FCC  Rcd  1359  (2001) (issuing  a 
Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for, inter  alia,  a  cable 
television    operator's     repeated    signal    leakage).  
``Repeated''  merely means  that  the act  was committed  or 
omitted  more  than  once,  or  lasts  more  than  one  day.

for Forfeiture, Forfeiture Order, 17 FCC Rcd 7589, 7591, ¶ 4 
(2002) (forfeiture paid). 

55  7  broadcasts  x  3  stations  (WXTB(FM),  WRLX(FM)  and 
WPLA(FM)) =  21 violations +  5 broadcasts by WCKT(FM)  = 26 
violations.

Amendment of  Section 1.80 of  the Rules to  Incorporate the 
Forfeiture  Guidelines,  12  FCC Rcd  17087,  17113  (1997), 
recon. denied,  15 FCC  Rcd 303 (1999)  (``Forfeiture Policy 
Statement'');  47  C.F.R.  § 1.80(b).   The  Commission  has 
amended  its  rules to  increase  the  maximum penalties  to 
account  for  inflation since  the  last  adjustment of  the 
penalty rates.  The new rates apply to violations that occur 
or  continue  after November  13,  2000.   See Amendment  of 
Section 1.80(b) of the  Commission's Rules and Adjustment of 
Forfeiture  Maxima to  Reflect Inflation,  15 FCC  Rcd 18221 
(2000).

57 The maximum forfeiture amount  for a single violation for 
the broadcast  of apparently  indecent material  is $27,500.

61 Station  WXTB(FM), Station WRLX(FM) and  Station WPLA(FM) 
shall each be allocated the  sum of Two Hundred Two Thousand 
Five  Hundred   Dollars  ($202,500.00)  for   six  indecency 
violations and  one public inspection file  violation   (6 x 
$27,500 =  $192,500 + $10,000  = $202,500).  The sum  of One 
Hundred   Forty-Seven   Thousand    Five   Hundred   Dollars 
($147,500.00)  is allocated  to  Station  WCKT(FM) for  five 
violations  of  the  Commission's indecency  rules  and  one 
violation of the Commission's public inspection file rule [5 
x $27,500 = $137,500 + $10,000 = $147,500).
