 <P>In the continuing quest to provide optimal care for animals in captivity,  the issue of abnormal behaviors is a cause for concern.  Whether we call them  stereotypic, neurotic, nonadaptive, or atypical, behaviors of this kind are  problematic.  The co

n
 sequences of abnormal behaviors range from unpleasant sights for the zoo visitor, as in the case of coprophagy in a resident gorilla, to serious health problems for the animals themselves, such as self-biting in a singly housed rhesus macaque.  Animals e

x
 hibit abnormal behaviors in a variety of social and environmental contexts: naturalistic and purely functional, large social groupings and singly housed, enriched and sterile.  No zoo, laboratory, or breeding facility, it would seem, is exempt.  Neither 

i
 s any species.  One approach to dealing with abnormal behavior is through the use of behavioral management techniques.  Behavioral management refers to the combined use of positive reinforcement training and environmental enrichment techniques.</P>
 
 <P>A variety of strategies to address abnormal behavior have been reported, and they tend to fall into three main categories: feeding manipulations including types of food and methods of feeding (<A HREF="#r15">Ruempler, 1991</A>; <A HREF="#r2">Bloomsmit

h
 , 1988</A>); environmental manipulations and provisioning of toys and apparatus (<A HREF="#r4">Bryant, et al., 1988</A>; <A HREF="#r7">Fried, et al., 1993</A>); and social manipulations (<A HREF="#r14">Reinhardt, 1987</A>).  These various strategies have

 
 produced mixed results.  Unfortunately, even in the best case scenarios, abnormal behaviors are most often reduced, not eliminated.  References to the use of training as an intervention for abnormal behavioral problems are still fairly rare 
(<A HREF="#r12">Morgan, et al., 1993</A>; 
<A HREF="#r10">Kirtland, 1993</A>).</P>
 
 <P>There are good reasons why efforts to reduce or eliminate abnormal behavior have limited success.  First, the causes of abnormal behavior are often subtle and complex, and tracking down how and why the problem began can be a task worthy of Magnum P.I.

 
  Second, the relationship between real or perceived stressors and abnormal behavior can result in the behavior serving as a functional coping strategy for the animal (<A HREF="#r8">Gould and Bres, 1986</A>).  Once utilized as coping strategies, these beh

a
 viors are self-reinforcing and extremely tenacious in nature.  Finally, problem behaviors often occur when people are not present, limiting the opportunity for direct intervention.</P>
 
 <P>So, what benefits can behavioral management techniques offer personnel dealing with abnormal behavior problems?  The greatest benefit they provide is the means to systematically address abnormal behavior and the underlying behavioral issues.  In its p

u
 rest form, a behavioral management approach is a practical exercise in the scientific method.  The following steps illustrate the process.
 
 <OL>
 <LI><STRONG>Collect data</STRONG>.  This is the question-asking phase of the process.
 Discovering when, where, and how a behavior occurs, and in relation to what,
 will ultimately lead you to a best guess as to why it occurs, and provide
 the basis for effective intervention.  Relevant information includes:
 
 <UL>
 <LI>When does the behavior occur?;</LI>
 
 <LI>Under what circumstances?;</LI>
 
 <LI>Is there a pattern?;</LI>
 
 <LI>What outside factors affect the behavior such as feeding or cleaning
   schedules, medical procedures, the presence of unfamiliar people,
   activities involving animals other than the target animal, the presence or
   absence of cage or exhibit furniture, and so on?; and</LI>
 
 <LI>What impact do social dynamics have on the behavior such as the social
   status of the target animal, the lack of compatible conspecifics, the
   presence or absence of specific group members, and the level of positive
   and agonistic interactions within the group?  The more objective the data,
   the better.  Formal behavioral studies are ideal, but simple charts for
   when and how a behavior occurs, filled out by keepers or caregivers as
   they go about their daily activities, improve the quality of the
   information.<br><br></LI>
 </UL></LI>
 
 <LI><P><STRONG>Develop a hypothesis</STRONG>.  After a careful discovery process, a list of
 potential causes and contributing factors should be developed.  Then, it's
 possible to make a guess as to why the abnormal behavior is occurring.  For
 example, we could hypothesize that disruptive behavior by a chimpanzee, like
 throwing feces or trying to grab caregivers, is an attention-seeking
 behavior, whether the resulting attention is positive or negative.  Or, we
 could guess that social pressure by the dominant male sea lion coupled with
 a predictable feeding routine are the underlying causes for a low-ranking
 sea lion regurgitating for extended periods of time after regularly
 scheduled feeds.  The importance of a well-developed hypothesis is that it
 is the starting point from which your intervention plan is developed.</P></LI>
 
 <LI><P><STRONG>Identify specific behavioral goals and initiate training and enrichment
 strategies</STRONG>.  With a clear hypothesis, you can design and implement an
 intervention plan to address targeted behaviors from a behavioral management
 perspective.  For example, by definition, reinforcement increases the
 likelihood that a behavior will recur.  In the case of the primate that
 utilizes disruptive behavior as an attention-seeking measure, look at the
 situation and determine where the reinforcement is occurring.  More than
 likely, when the animal uses the disruptive behavior it receives a great
 deal of attention, probably negative, but attention none the less.  Indeed,
 &quot;displays&quot; put on by frustrated humans who have just been &quot;had&quot; can be quite
 entertaining.  But what is perhaps more relevant is what happens when the
 animal is <EM>not</EM> disruptive.  Chances are the human walks right by.</P>
 
 <P>According to the hypothesis, human attention is the reinforcement the
 animal is seeking.  So, when are the rewards occurring, and what are the
 results?  Ironically, feces throwing and arm grabbing are being continuously
 reinforced, while non-aggressive cooperation is not being reinforced at all.
 The resultant behavior is consistent with the reinforcement pattern.  The
 intervention strategy is then two fold.  First, reinforce the animal when it
 is not disruptive.  Stop for a moment, say a few words, offer a small treat
 or favored toy, <EM>reinforce</EM> cooperative behavior (<A HREF="#Fig1">fig. 1</A>). 
  Second, do not reinforce the disruptive behavior.  Turn around, count to 10, or walk away,
 and then look for any opportunity to reinforce the desirable behavior.  This
 is a straightforward, simplified example of the problem-solving process.
 However, it is amazing how often this pattern is repeated in a variety of
 contexts with similar <A NAME="Fig1">results</A>.</P>

 </CENTER>
 
 <P>In the case of the regurgitating sea lion, strategies must be devised to
 address both contributing factors identified in the hypothesis.  First, the
 socialization problem can be dealt with by utilizing a training technique
 called &quot;cooperative feeding.&quot; Operationally, it entails reinforcing two
 events simultaneously: dominant animals are reinforced for allowing
 subdominant animals to work and receive food or attention, while the
 subdominant animals are reinforced for being &quot;brave&quot; enough to work and
 accept food or attention in the presence of these more aggressive animals.
 In this case, training would focus on the target animal and the dominant
 male (<A HREF="#Fig2">Fig. 2</A>).  Second, the feeding schedule should be altered to make it
 less predictable.  If times of feeds are on a set schedule, extra
 cooperative feeding sessions should be added in-between.  Finally,
 enrichment strategies should be implemented in-between feeds to provide
 activity options other than <A NAME="Fig2">regurgitation</A>.</P>

 </CENTER>
 
 <LI><P><STRONG>Check the results</STRONG>.  There are no pat answers or guarantees in dealing
 with behavior, problematic or otherwise.  It is dynamic in nature, and so
 much of what we do is guesswork.  However, there are two processes that
 increase the likelihood of making the right guesses.  First: the quality and
 extent of information gathered prior to initiating any work--the data
 collection phase.  That, coupled with knowledge of the individual animal,
 makes a carefully developed <EM>hypothesis</EM> an educated guess.  Second: an
 on-going evaluation of information you get back from the activity.  Is a
 particular strategy achieving the results that are anticipated?  If the
 answer is yes, it's a good bet to stay with the current strategy.  If the
 answer is no, it's time to reevaluate and perhaps try something else.</P></LI>
 
 <LI><P><STRONG>Adjust strategies if necessary</STRONG>.  It is critical to maintain a realistic
 expectation of results, so a strategy is not abandoned too quickly, or
 sustained too long.  If that occurs, the result can be a great deal of
 frustration and confusion for the animal, which may worsen the problem.
 When one approach has been tried for a sufficient length of time (a critical
 judgment call) without the desired results, try something else.  Then, check
 results again, and continue to adjust strategies as necessary.  In tough
 cases, it may be necessary to try several different strategies before one
 works.  Or often, it will be a combination of strategies that finally
 achieves the desired results.  That's why good behavioral management skills
 include a heavy dose of creativity, innovation, and most important,
 flexibility.</P></LI>
 </OL>
 
 <P>The following are some specific examples of how behavioral management
 strategies have been used to decrease or eliminate abnormal behaviors.</P>
 
 <P>Over a period of 7 months, a pilot behavioral project was conducted with
 a group of drill baboons (<A HREF="#r6">Desmond, et al., 1987</A>).  The primary goal of the
 project was to increase positive social interactions and reproduction among
 the group members (<A HREF="#Fig3">fig. 3</A>).  There was also concern about a sub-adult male
 who had been introduced to the group 6 months previously and was shunned bythem.
 He often appeared stressed, and exhibited some abnormal behavior.
 Intervention was difficult due to the social dynamics within the group which
 made him and other subdominant animals inaccessible to the keepers for
 handling or husbandry <A NAME="Fig3">purposes</A>.</P>
 
 <CENTER>

 </TABLE>
 <P>Fig. 3.  Drill grooming behavior increased as a result of training.</P>
 </CENTER>
 
 <P>A thorough information-gathering process was conducted, which included
 interviews with relevant personnel and assessment of behavioral observation
 data conducted on the group for the previous 2 years.  Based on this
 information, a hypothesis was formulated.  The hypothesis was that a
 long-term moderate state of sensory deprivation had existed in the exhibit.
 This shortage of stimulation had resulted in subtle competition among group
 members which, in turn, inhibited breeding, other positive social
 interactions, and interest in interacting with the environment.  It also
 contributed to the presence of problematic behaviors by all group members
 including fence nibbling, self-biting, and examining and eating feces.</P>
 
 <P>Based on this hypothesis, the following behavioral goals and strategies
 were developed:</P>
 
 <OL>
 <LI>Increase overall sensory stimulation of the group through regular
 training sessions.</LI>
 
 <LI>Increase positive social interactions in the group by cooperatively
 feeding animals in different dyads and triads, reinforcing them for eating
 and relaxing in close proximity to one another.</LI>
 
 <LI>Increase keeper access to individual animals by establishing feeding
 stations and targets to control food intake, the movement of animals, and
 achieve voluntary separation.</LI>
 </OL>
 
 <P>Although reducing abnormal behaviors was a goal, the training strategies
 were developed to address the underlying <EM>causes</EM> of these behaviors -
 insufficient sensory stimulation, and socialization problems.
 Operationally, the young male was often paired with an adult female for
 cooperative feeding sessions.  She was reinforced for þstayingþ while he was
 given food and personal attention.  He learned to gently touch the trainer's
 hand and arm, approximating grooming.  He slowly became less nervous and
 agitated when eating with the female, and increasingly more relaxed.  Prior
 to this project, he had been observed biting his leg in a manner and
 frequency that indicated the potential onset of neurotic behavior.  Keepers
 familiar with the exhibit reported a significant reduction in the observance
 of the behavior throughout the training project.</P>
 
 <P>Documented results (table 1) showed significant increases in all forms
 of positive, social interactions during and following the project (<A HREF="#r5">Cox, 1987</A>).  Reduction in all forms of abnormal behavior was also achieved (table 2).</P>

 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>
 
 <P><EM>Note: Although aggressive behavior increased on an absolute level
 from before training to during training, it dropped from 34% to 25% of the
 total social interaction.</EM></P>
 
 <P>Another project illustrating the process of addressing abnormal
 behaviors involved a captive-born Bottlenose dolphin named Pepe (<A HREF="#r11">Laule,
 1984</A>).  Living with a couple of other young animals, two separate attempts
 were made to integrate him into a larger social grouping of show animals.
 These attempts were unsuccessful, and in the process he developed several
 abnormal and problematic behaviors.  These included an erratic appetite and
 attention span; biting people during unstructured play sessions; habitual
 regurgitation; and chronically swallowing objects that fell into the water.</P>
 
 <P>In researching Pepe's situation and history, several factors were
 identified which may have contributed to the development of these problem
 behaviors.  First there were health-related problems, including the presence
 of small ulcers which could have affected his appetite and energy level.  He
 had also sustained an injury to his peduncle area, which caused occasional
 swelling and which was under constant scrutiny.  This was later diagnosed to
 be osteomyelitis and a source of his chronically high white blood cell
 counts.</P>
 
 <P>Another factor was his submissive behavior.  Whenever he was introduced
 into the larger social group, despite his greater size, Pepe always aligned
 himself with the subdominant males and quickly became the lowest ranking
 animal.  In that weak position, pressures were placed on him that he was
 apparently unable to cope with.</P>
 
 <P>Differences in training regimen from one condition to the other may have
 also been a factor.  These changes included the loss of his one primary
 trainer and subsequent replacement by four new individuals.  Behavioral
 charts indicate that in the second condition he was worked inconsistently,
 less often, and with less challenging work.  In a period of almost 2 years,
 he learned only one new behavior while losing several others.  He also
 received less personal attention.</P>
 
 <P>One last factor concerns the age at which Pepe was separated from his
 mother, and the impact that may have had on his subsequent development.
 Compared to the other five dolphins born at the park, Pepe's separation from
 his mother, at 18 months, was at a substantially earlier age.  The average
 age of the other five animals was 29 months, with the youngest being 26
 months and the oldest 33 months.</P>
 
 <P>Although I found no definitive research or conclusions on optimal age of
 separation, Herman notes, in his book <EM>Cetacean Behavior</EM>, &quot;Close affiliation
 between the newborn and mother continues for an extended period of time and
 dependency may persist even into adulthood&quot; (<A HREF="#r9">Herman, 1980</A>).  Whether this
 had an impact on Pepe's later problems is uncertain.  Nonetheless, it is
 noteworthy, in light of the extensive research done by John Bowlby on early
 separation of young human children from their mothers and the far- reaching
 effects this has on personality and behavioral development (<A HREF="#r3">Bowlby, 1973</A>).</P>
 
 <P>Once the potential causes and contributing factors were identified, a
 variety of strategies were employed to address each of the problematic
 conditions.  Because of his delicate health, he was the first dolphin to be
 trained to present his tail flukes for blood sampling, and to accept a
 stomach tube and fecal tube insertion for sample collection.  With his
 voluntary cooperation, it was easier and less stressful to perform these
 procedures and monitor his health on a regular and frequent basis.</P>
 
 <P>To help stabilize his eating habits, and to curb his throwing up,
 different feeding schedules were employed.  For a period of 2 weeks, Pepe
 was fed twice nightly to increase his appetite and weight.  Little change
 was noted.  Next, a schedule of eight feeds per day was begun which
 continued for approximately 2 months.  His normal diet was fed in small
 amounts over the course of the day, with at least three of the feeds being
 training sessions.  Accurate charts were kept, listing the time of day,
 number of pounds fed, and the amount, if any, of regurgitation seen.  This
 provided a clear picture of Pepe's eating and regurgitating habits, and the
 evidence of change when it did occur.  Specific intervention for the
 regurgitation included using a verbal &quot;no&quot; and short time out when Pepe
 would regurgitate during or after his feeds.  Extra time was spent with him
 immediately following a feed, during which time he was rewarded with
 attention and play for not regurgitating.</P>
 
 <P>To address both the problem biting and his habit of swallowing foreign
 objects, desensitization work was initiated to train him to allow us to
 touch his mouth, tongue, and teeth, without biting.  At the same time, he
 was trained to retrieve safe objects like paper cups or paper towels, and
 then let us open his mouth and remove the objects from his mouth or throat.
 Third, with a trainer in the water with him, work was begun with Pepe,
 reinforcing him for gentle play and non-biting behavior.  The reinforcement
 was high at first, then slowly reduced until reinforcement was no longer
 necessary at all.</P>
 
 <P>To assist in his socialization, he was specifically worked with each of
 the dominant animals.  Pepe was encouraged and rewarded for participating in
 these sessions, while the dominant animal was rewarded for allowing him to
 do so.  Conversely, if Pepe did not work, reinforcement was withheld from
 the other male until he did.</P>
 
 <P>Other behavioral strategies included maintaining consistency of
 trainers, keeping the number of daily training sessions high, and balancing
 sessions between individual work and work with other animals.  Special care
 was also taken to provide Pepe with a lot of personal attention (<A HREF="#Fig4">fig. 4</A>).</P>

 </TABLE>
 <P>Fig. 4. Pepe received extra personal attention during interventions to address abnormal behaviors.</P>
 </CENTER>
 
 <P>Finally, Pepe was moved to a different show area with four other
 animals.  From the first day, consistency in trainers was maintained by
 having myself or another familiar trainer with him everyday.  For the first
 2 weeks, we spent all of our extra time with Pepe, just sitting with him,
 rubbing him down, or playing.  For 2 months, we were present during shows
 and training sets to work exclusively with him.  Concurrently, the other
 animals were reinforced for allowing Pepe to work, and any positive social
 interactions were reinforced.</P>
 
 <P>The results of these strategies were quite encouraging.  Pepe was
 successfully integrated into the show.  Socially, he appeared comfortable,
 interacting with all of the other animals and developing a strong bond with
 the female pilot whale, each displaying imitative behavior learned from the
 other.</P>
 
 <P>His biting stopped completely.  He would allow us to open his mouth and
 remove any objects.  Rubbing his mouth and tongue became his favorite
 tactile behavior.  In fact, Pepe's overall responsiveness to people increased tremendously. 
  He would now seek attention and interact gently and non-aggressively. 
  His retrieval work improved, so that he would voluntarily return an item he 
 found to the trainer, or retrieve a specific object we
 pointed to.</P>
 
 <P>His throwing up almost completely disappeared, with only an isolated
 occurrence being noted.  His appetite and attention span, although
 occasionally erratic, improved greatly overall.  He maintained his
 repertoire of behaviors and continued to learn others.</P>
 
 <P>The examples I described were ambitious attempts to address and resolve
 a complex set of problematic behavioral issues.  These efforts required an
 investment of time and effort that may not be practical or possible in many
 situations.  However, what is applicable to every situation is the <EM>process</EM>.
 It doesn't have to be complicated and tedious, but to some degree it has to
 be done.  Abnormal behavior is not a simple problem, and there are rarely
 simple solutions.  The greatest success in dealing with abnormal behavior
 will come from addressing the causes of the problem, not just the problem
 behavior itself.  With that approach, there are often simple things that can
 be done to positively impact the situation to some degree (<A HREF="#r1">Bayne, et al., 1993</A>).</P>
 
 <P>Behavior is an acknowledged indicator of well-being 
 (Petto et al., 1990).  When we strive to provide optimal care for captive animals by
 providing for their physical and psychological well-being, reducing or
 eliminating abnormal behavior is an issue that cannot be overlooked or
 shortchanged.
