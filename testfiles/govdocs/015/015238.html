     In the continuing quest to provide optimal care for animals in
 captivity, the issue of abnormal behaviors is a cause for concern.  Whether
 we call them stereotypic, neurotic, nonadaptive, or atypical, behaviors of
 this kind are problematic.  The consequences of abnormal behaviors range
 from unpleasant sights for the zoo visitor, as in the case of coprophagy in
 a resident gorilla, to serious health problems for the animals themselves,
 such as self-biting in a singly housed rhesus macaque.  Animals exhibit
 abnormal behaviors in a variety of social and environmental contexts:
 naturalistic and purely functional, large social groupings and singly
 housed, enriched and sterile.  No zoo, laboratory, or breeding facility, it
 would seem, is exempt.  Neither is any species.  One approach to dealing
 with abnormal behavior is through the use of behavioral management
 techniques.  Behavioral management refers to the combined use of positive
 reinforcement training and environmental enrichment techniques.
 
     A variety of strategies to address abnormal behavior have been reported,
 and they tend to fall into three main categories: feeding manipulations
 including types of food and methods of feeding (Ruempler, 1991; Bloomsmith,
 1988); environmental manipulations and provisioning of toys and apparatus
 (Bryant, et al., 1988; Fried, et al., 1993); and social manipulations
 (Reinhardt, 1987).  These various strategies have produced mixed results.
 Unfortunately, even in the best case scenarios, abnormal behaviors are most
 often reduced, not eliminated.  References to the use of training as an
 intervention for abnormal behavioral problems are still fairly rare (Morgan,
 et al., 1993; Kirtland, 1993).
 
     There are good reasons why efforts to reduce or eliminate abnormal
 behavior have limited success.  First, the causes of abnormal behavior are
 often subtle and complex, and tracking down how and why the problem began
 can be a task worthy of Magnum P.I.  Second, the relationship between real
 or perceived stressors and abnormal behavior can result in the behavior
 serving as a functional coping strategy for the animal (Gould and Bres,
 1986).  Once utilized as coping strategies, these behaviors are
 self-reinforcing and extremely tenacious in nature.  Finally, problem
 behaviors often occur when people are not present, limiting the opportunity
 for direct intervention.
 
     So, what benefits can behavioral management techniques offer personnel
 dealing with abnormal behavior problems?  The greatest benefit they provide
 is the means to systematically address abnormal behavior and the underlying
 behavioral issues.  In its purest form, a behavioral management approach is
 a practical exercise in the scientific method.  The following steps
 illustrate the process.
 
 1.  Collect data.  This is the question-asking phase of the process.
 Discovering when, where, and how a behavior occurs, and in relation to what,
 will ultimately lead you to a best guess as to why it occurs, and provide
 the basis for effective intervention.  Relevant information includes:
 
 - When does the behavior occur?;
 
 - Under what circumstances?;
 
 - Is there a pattern?;
 
 - What outside factors affect the behavior such as feeding or cleaning
   schedules, medical procedures, the presence of unfamiliar people,
   activities involving animals other than the target animal, the presence or
   absence of cage or exhibit furniture, and so on?; and
 
 - What impact do social dynamics have on the behavior such as the social
   status of the target animal, the lack of compatible conspecifics, the
   presence or absence of specific group members, and the level of positive
   and agonistic interactions within the group?  The more objective the data,
   the better.  Formal behavioral studies are ideal, but simple charts for
   when and how a behavior occurs, filled out by keepers or caregivers as
   they go about their daily activities, improve the quality of the
   information.
 
 2.  Develop a hypothesis.  After a careful discovery process, a list of
 potential causes and contributing factors should be developed.  Then, it's
 possible to make a guess as to why the abnormal behavior is occurring.  For
 example, we could hypothesize that disruptive behavior by a chimpanzee, like
 throwing feces or trying to grab caregivers, is an attention-seeking
 behavior, whether the resulting attention is positive or negative.  Or, we
 could guess that social pressure by the dominant male sea lion coupled with
 a predictable feeding routine are the underlying causes for a low-ranking
 sea lion regurgitating for extended periods of time after regularly
 scheduled feeds.  The importance of a well-developed hypothesis is that it
 is the starting point from which your intervention plan is developed.
 
 3.  Identify specific behavioral goals and initiate training and enrichment
 strategies.  With a clear hypothesis, you can design and implement an
 intervention plan to address targeted behaviors from a behavioral management
 perspective.  For example, by definition, reinforcement increases the
 likelihood that a behavior will recur.  In the case of the primate that
 utilizes disruptive behavior as an attention-seeking measure, look at the
 situation and determine where the reinforcement is occurring.  More than
 likely, when the animal uses the disruptive behavior it receives a great
 deal of attention, probably negative, but attention none the less.  Indeed,
 "displays" put on by frustrated humans who have just been "had" can be quite
 entertaining.  But what is perhaps more relevant is what happens when the
 animal is not disruptive.  Chances are the human walks right by.
 
     According to the hypothesis, human attention is the reinforcement the
 animal is seeking.  So, when are the rewards occurring, and what are the
 results?  Ironically, feces throwing and arm grabbing are being continuously
 reinforced, while non-aggressive cooperation is not being reinforced at all.
 The resultant behavior is consistent with the reinforcement pattern.  The
 intervention strategy is then two fold.  First, reinforce the animal when it
 is not disruptive.  Stop for a moment, say a few words, offer a small treat
 or favored toy, reinforce cooperative behavior (fig.  1).  Second, do not
 reinforce the disruptive behavior.  Turn around, count to 10, or walk away,
 and then look for any opportunity to reinforce the desirable behavior.  This
 is a straightforward, simplified example of the problem-solving process.
 However, it is amazing how often this pattern is repeated in a variety of
 contexts with similar results.
 <IMG SRC="./lauleb1.gif"><br>
 <EM>Fig. 1. Rewarding non-aggressive cooperation helps eliminate disruptive
 attention-seeking behaviors.</EM><br>
 
     In the case of the regurgitating sea lion, strategies must be devised to
 address both contributing factors identified in the hypothesis.  First, the
 socialization problem can be dealt with by utilizing a training technique
 called þcooperative feeding. Operationally, it entails reinforcing two
 events simultaneously: dominant animals are reinforced for allowing
 subdominant animals to work and receive food or attention, while the
 subdominant animals are reinforced for being þbraveþ enough to work and
 accept food or attention in the presence of these more aggressive animals.
 In this case, training would focus on the target animal and the dominant
 male (fig.  2).  Second, the feeding schedule should be altered to make it
 less predictable.  If times of feeds are on a set schedule, extra
 cooperative feeding sessions should be added in-between.  Finally,
 enrichment strategies should be implemented in-between feeds to provide
 activity options other than regurgitation.
 <IMG SRC="./lauleb2.gif"><br>
 <EM>Fig. 2. Training can address socialization issues which are often
 contributing causes to abnormal behavior.</EM><br>
 
 4.  Check the results.  There are no pat answers or guarantees in dealing
 with behavior, problematic or otherwise.  It is dynamic in nature, and so
 much of what we do is guesswork.  However, there are two processes that
 increase the likelihood of making the right guesses.  First: the quality and
 extent of information gathered prior to initiating any workþthe data
 collection phase.  That, coupled with knowledge of the individual animal,
 makes a carefully developed hypothesis an educated guess.  Second: an
 on-going evaluation of information you get back from the activity.  Is a
 particular strategy achieving the results that are anticipated?  If the
 answer is yes, it's a good bet to stay with the current strategy.  If the
 answer is no, it's time to reevaluate and perhaps try something else.
 
 5.  Adjust strategies if necessary.  It is critical to maintain a realistic
 expectation of results, so a strategy is not abandoned too quickly, or
 sustained too long.  If that occurs, the result can be a great deal of
 frustration and confusion for the animal, which may worsen the problem.
 When one approach has been tried for a sufficient length of time (a critical
 judgment call) without the desired results, try something else.  Then, check
 results again, and continue to adjust strategies as necessary.  In tough
 cases, it may be necessary to try several different strategies before one
 works.  Or often, it will be a combination of strategies that finally
 achieves the desired results.  That's why good behavioral management skills
 include a heavy dose of creativity, innovation, and most important,
 flexibility.
 
     The following are some specific examples of how behavioral management
 strategies have been used to decrease or eliminate abnormal behaviors.
 
     Over a period of 7 months, a pilot behavioral project was conducted with
 a group of drill baboons (Desmond, et al., 1987).  The primary goal of the
 project was to increase positive social interactions and reproduction among
 the group members (fig.  3).  There was also concern about a sub-adult male
 who had been introduced to the group 6 months previously and was shunned bythem.
 He often appeared stressed, and exhibited some abnormal behavior.
 Intervention was difficult due to the social dynamics within the group which
 made him and other subdominant animals inaccessible to the keepers for
 handling or husbandry purposes.
 <IMG SRC="./lauleb3.gif"><br>
 <EM>Fig. 3. Drill grooming behavior increased as a result of training.</EM>
 <br>
     A thorough information-gathering process was conducted, which included
 interviews with relevant personnel and assessment of behavioral observation
 data conducted on the group for the previous 2 years.  Based on this
 information, a hypothesis was formulated.  The hypothesis was that a
 long-term moderate state of sensory deprivation had existed in the exhibit.
 This shortage of stimulation had resulted in subtle competition among group
 members which, in turn, inhibited breeding, other positive social
 interactions, and interest in interacting with the environment.  It also
 contributed to the presence of problematic behaviors by all group members
 including fence nibbling, self-biting, and examining and eating feces.
 
     Based on this hypothesis, the following behavioral goals and strategies
 were developed:
 
 1.  Increase overall sensory stimulation of the group through regular
 training sessions.
 
 2.  Increase positive social interactions in the group by cooperatively
 feeding animals in different dyads and triads, reinforcing them for eating
 and relaxing in close proximity to one another.
 
 3.  Increase keeper access to individual animals by establishing feeding
 stations and targets to control food intake, the movement of animals, and
 achieve voluntary separation.
 
     Although reducing abnormal behaviors was a goal, the training strategies
 were developed to address the underlying causes of these behaviors -
 insufficient sensory stimulation, and socialization problems.
 Operationally, the young male was often paired with an adult female for
 cooperative feeding sessions.  She was reinforced for þstayingþ while he was
 given food and personal attention.  He learned to gently touch the trainer's
 hand and arm, approximating grooming.  He slowly became less nervous and
 agitated when eating with the female, and increasingly more relaxed.  Prior
 to this project, he had been observed biting his leg in a manner and
 frequency that indicated the potential onset of neurotic behavior.  Keepers
 familiar with the exhibit reported a significant reduction in the observance
 of the behavior throughout the training project.
 
     Documented results (table 1) showed significant increases in all forms
 of positive, social interactions during and following the project (Cox,
 1987).  Reduction in all forms of abnormal behavior was also achieved (table
 2).
 <IMG SRC="./lauleb4.gif"><br>
 <EM>Note: Although aggressive behavior increased on an absolute level
 from before training to during training, it dropped from 34% to 25% of the
 total social interaction.</EM><br>
 
     Another project illustrating the process of addressing abnormal
 behaviors involved a captive-born Bottlenose dolphin named Pepe (Laule,
 1984).  Living with a couple of other young animals, two separate attempts
 were made to integrate him into a larger social grouping of show animals.
 These attempts were unsuccessful, and in the process he developed several
 abnormal and problematic behaviors.  These included an erratic appetite and
 attention span; biting people during unstructured play sessions; habitual
 regurgitation; and chronically swallowing objects that fell into the water.
 
     In researching Pepe's situation and history, several factors were
 identified which may have contributed to the development of these problem
 behaviors.  First there were health-related problems, including the presence
 of small ulcers which could have affected his appetite and energy level.  He
 had also sustained an injury to his peduncle area, which caused occasional
 swelling and which was under constant scrutiny.  This was later diagnosed to
 be osteomyelitis and a source of his chronically high white blood cell
 counts.
 
     Another factor was his submissive behavior.  Whenever he was introduced
 into the larger social group, despite his greater size, Pepe always aligned
 himself with the subdominant males and quickly became the lowest ranking
 animal.  In that weak position, pressures were placed on him that he was
 apparently unable to cope with.
 
     Differences in training regimen from one condition to the other may have
 also been a factor.  These changes included the loss of his one primary
 trainer and subsequent replacement by four new individuals.  Behavioral
 charts indicate that in the second condition he was worked inconsistently,
 less often, and with less challenging work.  In a period of almost 2 years,
 he learned only one new behavior while losing several others.  He also
 received less personal attention.
 
     One last factor concerns the age at which Pepe was separated from his
 mother, and the impact that may have had on his subsequent development.
 Compared to the other five dolphins born at the park, Pepe's separation from
 his mother, at 18 months, was at a substantially earlier age.  The average
 age of the other five animals was 29 months, with the youngest being 26
 months and the oldest 33 months.
 
     Although I found no definitive research or conclusions on optimal age of
 separation, Herman notes, in his book Cetacean Behavior, þClose affiliation
 between the newborn and mother continues for an extended period of time and
 dependency may persist even into adulthoodþ (Herman, 1980).  Whether this
 had an impact on Pepe's later problems is uncertain.  Nonetheless, it is
 noteworthy, in light of the extensive research done by John Bowlby on early
 separation of young human children from their mothers and the far- reaching
 effects this has on personality and behavioral development (Bowlby, 1973).
 
     Once the potential causes and contributing factors were identified, a
 variety of strategies were employed to address each of the problematic
 conditions.  Because of his delicate health, he was the first dolphin to be
 trained to present his tail flukes for blood sampling, and to accept a
 stomach tube and fecal tube insertion for sample collection.  With his
 voluntary cooperation, it was easier and less stressful to perform these
 procedures and monitor his health on a regular and frequent basis.
 
     To help stabilize his eating habits, and to curb his throwing up,
 different feeding schedules were employed.  For a period of 2 weeks, Pepe
 was fed twice nightly to increase his appetite and weight.  Little change
 was noted.  Next, a schedule of eight feeds per day was begun which
 continued for approximately 2 months.  His normal diet was fed in small
 amounts over the course of the day, with at least three of the feeds being
 training sessions.  Accurate charts were kept, listing the time of day,
 number of pounds fed, and the amount, if any, of regurgitation seen.  This
 provided a clear picture of Pepe's eating and regurgitating habits, and the
 evidence of change when it did occur.  Specific intervention for the
 regurgitation included using a verbal þnoþ and short time out when Pepe
 would regurgitate during or after his feeds.  Extra time was spent with him
 immediately following a feed, during which time he was rewarded with
 attention and play for not regurgitating.
 
     To address both the problem biting and his habit of swallowing foreign
 objects, desensitization work was initiated to train him to allow us to
 touch his mouth, tongue, and teeth, without biting.  At the same time, he
 was trained to retrieve safe objects like paper cups or paper towels, and
 then let us open his mouth and remove the objects from his mouth or throat.
 Third, with a trainer in the water with him, work was begun with Pepe,
 reinforcing him for gentle play and non-biting behavior.  The reinforcement
 was high at first, then slowly reduced until reinforcement was no longer
 necessary at all.
 
     To assist in his socialization, he was specifically worked with each of
 the dominant animals.  Pepe was encouraged and rewarded for participating in
 these sessions, while the dominant animal was rewarded for allowing him to
 do so.  Conversely, if Pepe did not work, reinforcement was withheld from
 the other male until he did.
 
     Other behavioral strategies included maintaining consistency of
 trainers, keeping the number of daily training sessions high, and balancing
 sessions between individual work and work with other animals.  Special care
 was also taken to provide Pepe with a lot of personal attention (fig.  4).
 <IMG SRC="./laule5.gif"><br>
 <EM>Fig. 4. Pepe received extra personal attention during interventions to
 address abnormal behaviors.</EM><br>
 
     Finally, Pepe was moved to a different show area with four other
 animals.  From the first day, consistency in trainers was maintained by
 having myself or another familiar trainer with him everyday.  For the first
 2 weeks, we spent all of our extra time with Pepe, just sitting with him,
 rubbing him down, or playing.  For 2 months, we were present during shows
 and training sets to work exclusively with him.  Concurrently, the other
 animals were reinforced for allowing Pepe to work, and any positive social
 interactions were reinforced.
 
     The results of these strategies were quite encouraging.  Pepe was
 successfully integrated into the show.  Socially, he appeared comfortable,
 interacting with all of the other animals and developing a strong bond with
 the female pilot whale, each displaying imitative behavior learned from the
 other.
 
     His biting stopped completely.  He would allow us to open his mouth and
 remove any objects.  Rubbing his mouth and tongue became his favorite
 tactile behavior.  In fact, Pepe's overall responsiveness to people
 increased tremendously.  He would now seek attention and interact gently and
 non-aggressively.  His retrieval work improved, so that he would voluntarily
 return an item he found to the trainer, or retrieve a specific object we
 pointed to.
 
     His throwing up almost completely disappeared, with only an isolated
 occurrence being noted.  His appetite and attention span, although
 occasionally erratic, improved greatly overall.  He maintained his
 repertoire of behaviors and continued to learn others.
 
     The examples I described were ambitious attempts to address and resolve
 a complex set of problematic behavioral issues.  These efforts required an
 investment of time and effort that may not be practical or possible in many
 situations.  However, what is applicable to every situation is the process.
 It doesn't have to be complicated and tedious, but to some degree it has to
 be done.  Abnormal behavior is not a simple problem, and there are rarely
 simple solutions.  The greatest success in dealing with abnormal behavior
 will come from addressing the causes of the problem, not just the problem
 behavior itself.  With that approach, there are often simple things that can
 be done to positively impact the situation to some degree (Bayne, et al.,
 1993).
 
     Behavior is an acknowledged indicator of well-being (Petto et al.,
 1990).  When we strive to provide optimal care for captive animals by
 providing for their physical and psychological well-being, reducing or
 eliminating abnormal behavior is an issue that cannot be overlooked or
 shortchanged.

 <STRONG>Introduction</STRONG>
 
      Disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,
 earthquakes, severe winter weather, hazardous material spills or
 nuclear power plant accidents can occur any time. The event may
 occur suddenly or be anticipated for several days as with an
 approaching hurricane or flood. The time to prepare for these
 events is long before they occur. Even at the farm level,
 procedures should be written. They should be kept in a safe,
 fireproof, quickly accessible place with other important
 documents and taken along if it becomes necessary to evacuate the
 farm. Each member of the farm family and herd personnel should
 know of and practice the plan so that action may be taken even in
 the absence of key management personnel. 
 
      The first step in planning for a disaster is to determine
 what type of disaster could occur on the farm and with what
 frequency. It would be useless to spend time and money, for
 example, to plan for severe winter weather if the farm is located
 in a tropical environment. If the premises are near a nuclear
 power plant, even though the risk of an accident occurring is
 slim, the owners would want to consider how to protect their
 animals from radioactive fallout. If the farm is near a major
 highway, one might want to consider a hazardous material spill
 from a road accident in the planning. Living next to a river or
 stream would put planning for flooding or a barge accident in the
 forefront. 
 
      Only after farm owners have considered their risks can they
 prioritize the time, money, and other resources they wish to
 allocate to each potential hazard. An all-hazards plan is most desirable;
 however, plans should also be customized for specific
 situations. Once the risks are known, decisions can be made about
 what actions can be taken in advance and what actions would be
 required once the disaster occurs. Generally, the effects of a
 disaster on livestock are lessened by avoiding the disaster,
 mitigating its effect if it cannot be avoided, or sheltering the
 animals. The approach taken would depend upon the type of
 disaster anticipated. Sometimes only one approach may be
 appropriate such as sheltering. In some instances, combined
 approaches, such as mitigation and sheltering, may be required. 
 In events such as floods or firestorms, sheltering may be the
 wrong thing to do. 
 
 <STRONG>Mitigation</STRONG>
 
      Hazard mitigation is defined as any action taken to
 eliminate or reduce the long-term risk to life and property from
 natural or technological hazards.  Some examples of hazard
 mitigation might be hurricane seeding to reduce the intensity of
 a storm, tying down homes or barns with ground anchors to
 withstand wind damage, redirecting the impact away from a
 vulnerable location by digging water channels or planting
 vegetation to absorb water, establishing setback regulations so
 building is not allowed close to the water's edge, and
 constructing levees or permanent barriers to control flooding. 
 
      The farm and farm buildings should be surveyed to figure out
 what mitigation procedures should be followed based on the hazard
 risk.  These procedures include:
 
 building or repairing barns and outbuildings so they exceed building codes;<BR>
 constructing or moving buildings to higher ground;<BR>
 replacing or covering glass windows and doors with sturdier materials;<BR>
 keeping drainage furrows sodded;<BR>  
 cleaning or moving trash piles and burial sites (Many
 farms contain burial sites contaminated with lead-based paints,
 machinery grease, motor oil, lead-lined tanks, batteries, roofing
 nails, asphalt, shingles, caulking compounds, linoleum and
 plumbing lead. During flooding this material may leech into the
 crops or feed supply or be moved to a more accessible area where
 animals could consume them.);<BR> 
 moving or storing toxic chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and rodenticides
 in secured areas to prevent their washing onto pastures where animals may
 be exposed;<BR>
 securing loose items;<BR>
 and draining or building levees around ponds that could flood.<BR>
  
      A list of resources and people should be developed by the
 farmer and kept with important papers.  This list should contain
 emergency phone numbers, suppliers, truckers, and people that can
 help with the animals, especially if normal working conditions
 are disrupted.
 
      Supplies that may be needed during or after the disaster
 should be obtained. Many of these items may not be readily
 available after the disaster. By obtaining them in advance, more
 reasonable prices will be paid. Unfortunately, disasters attract
 individuals who gouge and prey on the misfortunes of victims. 
 Items that could be obtained are portable radios and TV's, extra
 batteries, flashlights, candles, portable generators, salt,
 gravel, litter, fuel, antifreeze, stored feed such as hay (the
 amount to store would depend on the hazard--after the Washington
 State flood, most producers vowed never to inventory large
 amounts of hay due to excessive flood damage and spoilage),
 ropes, halters and other animal restraint equipment, and medical
 supplies.  Once obtained they should be stored in such a manner
 that they will be usable after the disaster.  While in storage
 they should be checked at regular intervals--i.e., once a
 week--to assure that they do not spoil, and that electrical or
 mechanical appliances are still working.  They should also be
 rechecked and evaluated after the event to assure they are still
 usable.  A log should be kept to record when and how often the
 items were monitored.  Animals should be kept current on all
 appropriate vaccinations and booster shots before the disaster. 
 Keep a written record of the products given and the date of
 injection. Because the stress of the event and the disruption of
 the environment could cause an increase in infectious disease
 spread, proper vaccination could protect the animals. 
 
 <STRONG>Representation to Governmental Agency Managing the Disaster
 Response</STRONG> 
 
      As the disaster approaches or after it arrives, the most
 important thing the farmer needs is truthful, accurate, and
 current information.  Government's response to most disasters is
 coordinated by a county, State, or Federal emergency management
 agency.  Representation to this agency for the farmer is
 critical. In most instances, this is competently done by a member
 of the State or Federal Department of Agriculture.  It is
 strongly suggested that farm organizations lobby for veterinary
 representation either through their State or Federal Department
 of Agriculture or separately to the emergency management agency. 
 Often, the needs of animals during disasters are given low
 priority.  Veterinarians, who are aware of these needs and can
 also verify the validity of requests for help, are most suited to
 bring animal problems to the forefront. In many instances,
 actions required to protect animals, such as sheltering or
 evacuation, must be done before a similar action is taken for
 people. This is because moving animals to shelter from pasture or
 evacuating them to other locations takes considerable time and
 many workers. However, governmental agencies will not issue such
 directives for animals before similar instructions are issued for
 people.  They fear that a panic situation might occur and people
 might be critical about animals being protected before them.
 (Animals can always be released from the shelter or returned from
 their point of evacuation if the disaster does not materialize.)
 What they do not consider is that it must be done while it is
 still safe for people to do the task since animals cannot shelter
 or evacuate themselves.  After the disaster, government usually
 limits access to the disaster area. However,  animals have to be
 fed, watered, and milked.  Who is better suited to do this than
 the owner? Designation of farmers as emergency workers by
 government solves the problem of who will be responsible for this
 task. A veterinarian located in the emergency operating center
 can get these messages across. 
 
 <STRONG>Evacuation</STRONG>
 
      If evacuation of the animals is being considered, then
 evacuation procedures, places, and routes should be planned. 
 Since all animals may not be able to be evacuated, owners should
 decide ahead of time which are the most important ones to save. 
 Various decision criteria can be used such as sale value,
 breeding quality, stage of pregnancy, stage of production, or
 simply sentimental preference.  These animals should be
 identified ahead of time and a written list kept.  If the owner
 is not home when the disaster threatens, others would then know
 which animals to save. 
 
      Animal evacuation routes must not interfere with human
 evacuation routes. Alternate routes should be found in case the
 planned route is not accessible.  Places where animals are to be
 taken should be decided in advance and arrangements made with the
 owners of these places to accept the animals.  Trucks, trailers,
 and other vehicles should be obtained in advance and the animals
 acclimated to them so they are not frightened when they have to
 be used.  Restraint equipment, feed and water supplies should be
 available to use and move with the animals and sufficient people
 should be on hand to help move them.  The animals should be
 photographed and permanently identified by metal eartag, tattoo,
 brand, registration papers, or microchip.  A permanent record of
 the identification must be kept as this information is useful in
 resolving arguments of ownership in case animals gets loose. 
 Papers documenting the identification should be kept with other
 important papers.  Ultimately, the decision to evacuate will
 depend on the distance to be traveled, the amount of time before
 the disaster will affect the farm, and whether there is any
 advantage to moving the animals to the place selected.  Sometimes
 evacuation may be done after the disaster, provided the roads are
 passable and the equipment needed for travel usable. If this is
 the case, the accepting location must be contacted to find out
 its condition.
 
 <STRONG>Sheltering</STRONG>
 
      Whether to move farm animals to shelter or leave them
 outside will depend on the integrity and location of the shelter
 being used and the type of disaster.  During Hurricane Andrew,
 some horses left outside suffered less injury then those placed
 in shelters.  This was because some shelters selected did not
 withstand the high winds.  Horses were injured by collapsing
 structures and flying objects that may have been avoided on the
 outside.  Another reason for possibly leaving animals unsheltered
 is because flood waters that inundate a barn could trap animals
 inside, causing them to drown.  During severe winter weather,
 shelter animals from icy wind, rain, and snow.  Generally, if the
 structure is sound, the animals should be placed indoors.  Once
 they are inside, secure all openings to the outside.  As
 mentioned previously, the sheltering should be ordered and
 completed before similar action is taken for humans.
 
      Farm cats and dogs should either be placed in a
 disaster-proof place or turned loose, as they generally will stay
 close to their home in the immediate period following a disaster. 
 If they are loose, however, attempts must be made to immediately
 catch them after the threat is over to prevent these animals from
 becoming feral and a public health hazard. Some farm dogs are
 dangerously aggressive, and under normal circumstances should be
 kept chained.  These dogs cannot be kept chained or turned loose
 during a disaster. If an inside shelter cannot be found, then the
 only safe and humane thing to do is to euthanize these dogs as a
 last measure before evacuation.
 
 <STRONG>Human Evacuation</STRONG>
 
      What can be done with the animals if there is a need to
 evacuate the premises and the animals have to be left unattended?
 There is always the risk that animals left unattended for
 extended periods could die or suffer injury.  Sometimes, this may
 be the only option to protect human life.  Protecting human life
 should always take priority in planning.  Regardless, after the
 animals are secured in appropriate shelters, food and water
 should be left for them.  The amount necessary for survival is
 considerably less than for other purposes.  If the animals
 survive, then the decision can be made after the disaster whether
 it is worth the time and expense to bring them back to their
 previous condition. 
 
      Consult the table as a guide to the amount of food and water
 to leave. Every practical effort should be made to leave animals
 with sufficient food and water for their survival-- enough for 48
 hours should be left. Usually, within that time the initial
 effects of the disaster will be over.  During the recovery phase,
 the decision can then be made as to the best way to mount a
 rescue effort.
 
 <STRONG>Special Considerations</STRONG>
 
      Some practices that may be followed in planning for
 disasters, especially during the winter, require a special alert. 
 During winter weather it is common to use portable heaters,
 gritty substances on the floor to prevent slipping, and
 antifreeze. When using these heaters, be sure they are working
 properly and are located in an area where there is adequate
 ventilation.  Heaters not working correctly could be a source of
 carbon monoxide, a deadly, odorless, colorless gas.  Antifreeze
 used in vehicles is a deadly poison.  Animals seem attracted to
 it and will readily consume it because of its sweet taste.  Take
 care to properly label all containers.  Do not use containers
 previously filled with antifreeze for other purposes, especially
 feed and water.  Promptly clean up all leaks and spills.  Water
 supplies should be checked for freezing.  Many animals have died
 of thirst during the winter, even with abundant water sources,
 because they could not drink the water as it was frozen solid. 
 If gritty material is spread on floors to prevent slipping, use
 only approved nontoxic materials.  Recently, a farmer mistakenly
 used Furadan, a fungicide, for this purpose and  several cows who
 licked it off the floor died.
 
      Farms can be insured against catastrophic events.  Insurance
 policies are available for replacement of damaged materials,
 repair work for recovery, boarding of evacuated occupants and
 animals, lost production, and relocation.  These should be
 investigated and purchased before the disaster threatens.  For a
 farmer to claim compensation for lost production, which in many
 cases is the largest economic cost during a disaster, the farmer
 must have substantial records that document the level of
 production his/her herd has achieved in previous years.  This is
 generally only successful in herds with recognized herd
 monitoring programs, such as Dairy Herd Improvement or other
 programs that are available for various species.  To verify the
 validity of these records a herd health program, based on a valid
 veterinarian-client-animal relationship, should be in place.  A
 copy of all production records should be kept in a secure place
 so that the details are not lost during the disaster.  Many
 veterinarians are willing to keep copies of their clients'
 production records, if they are computerized and space efficient.
 
 <STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG>
 
      Depending upon the event, disaster preparation may or may
 not be successful. However, it is known that effects of disasters
 are lessened by proper planning.  Economically, it is cheaper to
 prevent the problem or lessen its effect than to pay the costs of
 recovery.  The time to do this is NOW, before the disaster
 occurs.

 October-December 1993)
  
      In the recent article "Applying Principles of Aseptic
 Surgery to Rodents" [<STRONG><EM>Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter</EM></STRONG>
 4(2):3-6], T. L. Cunliffe-Beamer gives comprehensive guidance on
 the topic of the paper and points the reader's attention to a
 number of little "know-how" techniques to minimize or prevent
 various complications of surgery and perioperative infection in
 laboratory rodents.  My letter focuses on one of the potential
 problems of any rodent surgery, i.e., on what Cunliffe-Beamer
 termed "hypothermia from anesthesia." 
 
      It is true that anesthesia often results in a decrease in
 body temperature (Tb).  In this situation, however, the term
 hypothermia does not explain the nature of the thermoregulatory
 disturbance during and after narcosis and, moreover, may easily
 direct someone to a wrong strategy of preventing this
 disturbance.  Such a mistake, as I will explain below, may result
 in the animal's death.  Therefore, this problem is worthy of
 being discussed.
  
      It is well documented that an important (if not the
 important) factor in the development of anesthesia-associated
 falls in Tb is the modification of the character of Tb regulation
 (Sessler, 1991).  In intact, unanesthetized animals, cold-defense
 effector mechanisms are activated as soon as a minimal decrease
 in Tb develops, and heat-defense effectors are activated as soon
 as Tb rises by a minimal value.  Therefore, under normal
 circumstances, the threshold Tbs for activation of cold- and
 heat-defense mechanisms practically coincide (the interthreshold
 zone varies from 0 to 0.5oC). As a result, an intact homeothermic
 animal precisely regulates its Tb by immediately reacting in the
 appropriate way to any slight downward or upward deviation of Tb.
 
      In anesthetized animals, a homeothermic type of Tb
 regulation changes to a poikilothermic one.  An animal becomes
 nonresponsive to either a decrease or an increase in its Tb,
 unless the magnitude of the Tb deviation is very large.  It has
 been reported that the interthreshold zone during anesthesia may
 easily reach 4oC and that such a widening of the interthreshold
 zone develops not only by decreasing the threshold Tb for
 activation of the cold-defense mechanisms, but also by increasing
 the threshold Tb for activation of heat-defense (Sessler, 1991). 
 Such factors as operation trauma (Stoner, 1991) and, at late
 stages of postoperative recovery, fever (Vyb¡ral, et al. 1987)
 may also contribute to the development of poikilothermia after
 surgery.  Under these circumstances, Tb becomes the result of the
 passive heat transfer between the organism and environment within
 a wide interthreshold zone, Tb dependency on ambient temperature
 becomes markedly stronger and fluctuations in Tb easily become
 enlarged.  In other words, anesthesia-associated poikilothermic
 Tb regulation may result in hypothermia (which usually happens
 due to multiple reasons, partly mentioned by Cunliffe-Beamer,
 i.e., ambient temperature below thermoneutral, exposed body
 cavities, increase in exposed body surface during operation,
 etc.). However, the same type of Tb regulation may easily result
 in hyperthermia (e.g., when the animal is heated after an
 operation).  Unfortunately, postoperative overheating constitutes
 more than hypothetical danger: I know  a colleague who has had
 the sad experience of losing a group of three guinea pigs during
 immediate postoperative recovery under a heating lamp after a
 relatively simple surgical procedure.  Cunliffe-Beamer's
 recommendation to position a heat source so that the rodents can
 move away from it as they recover from anesthesia may not be
 efficient in preventing overheating since anesthesia-associated
 poikilothermia is characterized not by the inability of the
 effectors to lose heat, but rather by the unwillingness of the
 animal to respond to a heat load.  Moreover, after an animal
 becomes hyperthermic, it has much less chance to escape since
 hyperthermia by itself may induce poikilothermia (Romanovsky and
 Blatteis, 1993).
  
      In conclusion, surgery in rodents is accompanied by the
 development of poikilothermia, which usually results in
 hypothermia.  To prevent or minimize the hypothermia, animals
 must be kept warm during and after surgery.  Depending on animal
 species, type of surgery, anesthetic(s) used, etc., different
 protocols of heating may be followed.  As a general rule,
 however, such heating must be very mild and controlled very
 carefully.  The animals must be, at least periodically, watched
 throughout the recovery.  Otherwise, there is a potential danger
 of overheating, which may lead to the animal's exitus letalis.
