Psychol. 1980;38(5):793-800.

Retest coefficients for temperamental traits measured by the Guilford-Zimmerman 
Temperament Survey were assessed at 6- and 12-yr intervals to determine the degree of 
stability in personality and to evaluate the hypotheses that (a) younger men will show lower 
stability than older men and (b) traits related to neuroticism will be less stable than traits 
related to extraversion. Ss were 460 male volunteers in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study 
of Aging, ranging in age from 17 to 85 yrs at the time of 1st testing. Results show 
uncorrected stability coefficients ranging from .59 to .87. No consistent evidence of lower 
stability in younger Ss was found, and neurotic and extraverted traits appeared comparably 
stable when corrected for unreliability. The replicated pattern of consistent stability across 
age groups and across traits is discussed.
