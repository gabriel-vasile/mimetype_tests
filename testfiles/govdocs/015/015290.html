<ul>
<li><b>astro-ph.CO</b> - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics</li>
<li><b>astro-ph.EP</b> - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics</li>

<p><b>Hardware and Software Upgrades:</b> Over the weekend of 1/2 Feb 2008 
we moved arXiv to new hardware. This should allow us to keep up with the
ever increasing traffic and make several improvements. One is that we now
have a cache large enough to store processed PDF versions for all papers -- there
should be far fewer &quot;...processing...&quot; responses. We have also put
online several software improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>arXiv now accepts <a href="/help/submit_docx">submissions in DOCX/OOXML format</a>
(from Word 2007 and other OOXML compliant applications).</li>
<li>We have implemented version control for papers submitted prior to November 1997
in the same way as for papers submitted later. In many cases the earlier versions
were not recorded and are marked as such in the comments (e.g. 
<a href="/abs/hep-th/9108006v1">arXiv:hep-th/9108006v1</a>). However, in some
cases the earlier versions are now available in the usual way (e.g.
<a href="/abs/hep-th/9108019v1">arXiv:hep-th/9108019v1</a>).</li>

There have been a number of upgrades to the arXiv interface and processing system since
April 2007. These include:
<ul>
<li><em>arXiv now supports <a href="/help/submit_tex#pdflatex">PDFLaTeX</a>.</em>
TeX submissions may now include PDF, JPG, or PNG figures using the standard <code>\includegraphics</code> 
command from the <code>graphics</code> or <code>graphicx</code> packages.</li>
<li>The article <em><a href="/help/arxiv_identifier">identifier system</a> has been updated</em>.
The new scheme (which does not include subject information in the identifier) not only 
allows for a greater number of submissions each month, but it makes reclassification
easier (old identifiers did not permit changes in primary classication after announcement).
We also hope that the removal of optional subject-class information from the identifier 
will lead to more consistent citation and linking.</li>
<li>To find a specific paper for which you know the identifier, you may now simply type or paste 
the identifier (e.g. <code>hep-th/0501001</code>, <code>0704.0001</code> or <code>arXiv:0704.0002</code>) 
into the <em>search box at the top of every arXiv page</em>. This facility replaces the
&quot;abs&quot; links for each archive that used to be on the main page.</li>
<li>The <em>abstract pages have been redesigned</em> to more cleanly present the most important
information (title, authors, abstract, etc.) and to allow more links to related services
to be added in column on the right. See, for example, <a href="/abs/0704.1252">arXiv:0704.1252</a></li>
<li>The <em>Statistics archive</em> was <a href="/new/stat_announce.html">introduced</a> on 
1 April 2007.</li>
<li>The category <code>math.IT</code> was created as an alias for <em>Information Theory</em> 
(<code>cs.IT</code>) so that these papers will show in both math and cs searches.</li>

<p><b>Change to arXiv identifiers:</b> 
The current form of arXiv identifiers (e.g. 
<b><code><a href="/abs/math/0307245">arXiv:math.DG/0307245</a></code></b>) 
permits only 999 papers per month in any archive -- in October
of this year we got to paper 
<a href="/abs/math/0610989">989</a> in math, just 11 short of difficulty.
We thus have an urgent need to extend the maximum number of submissions 
that can be handled in a month. We will certainly exceed 999 papers in 
some months for some archives next year.</p>
<p>To address this issue (and several others), we are going to change the
format of identifiers for new papers starting in early 2007
(original 1 December announcement said 1 January 2007, since
<a href="#ids_2006">postponed</a>) to use
the form <b><code>arXiv:0706.0001</code></b>.</p>

expect a scheduled outage for a planned hardware upgrade. Because
we need to synchronize the database and other files between the two
machines, we will need to disable incoming submissions for several
hours. People planning to submit papers on that day should either
submit them before noon or plan to submit them on the following
Monday. 

<p>If all goes as planned, it should be possible to browse papers
on arXiv during most of the upgrade. If you do have problems, we

<dd><b>Endorsement System:</b> ArXiv initiates an endorsement
system for new submitters. Initially, only a small fraction of
submitters will be asked to provide endorsement. As the system is
phased in, most new submitters will require endorsement. Existing
submitters may not require endorsement for topics in which they
have been active.<br />
ArXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly
papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to
arXiv is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those
disciplines.<br />
ArXiv was developed to be, and remains, a means for specific
communities of scientists to exchange information. Moderators and
the arXiv administrative team have worked behind the scenes to
ensure that content is appropriate to the user communities. The
growth in number of submissions to arXiv necessitates an automated
endorsement system. Current members of arXiv scientific communities
will have the opportunity to endorse new submitters. This process
will ensure that arXiv content is relevant to current research
while controlling costs so we can continue to offer free and open
Web access to all.<br />

<a href="http://arXiv.org/new/nlin.html">nlin info</a> for more
information). The intent is to bring these archives into conformity
with the format of the newer archives, and to facilitate further
expansion or reorganization. (Note that this also means these
archives will now be updated -- and abstract mailings issued --
every weekday, rather than just once per week.) Beginning 1 Jan
2000, chao-dyn submissions for example should be sent To:
nlin@arXiv.org with the added line (i.e. following Title:, Author:,
etc.):<br />
<b>Subj-class:</b> Chaotic Dynamics<br />
and analogously for the other above subsumed archives. Submissions
to chao-dyn@arXiv.org will be automatically rerouted as above, and
assigned numbers beginning with nlin.CD/0001001. As a replacement
for the cross-listing mechanism (between nlin archives), use
multiple Subj-class: entries separated by ;'s (the first is the
primary). It is also possible to subscribe to receive daily
abstract notifications for any subset of the nlin-sys subject
classes (see <a href="http://arXiv.org/new/nlinsub.html">nlin

<dd>New domain name arXiv.org registered. All of archive.org,

Since the word 'archive' has a Greek root, X indicates the Greek
Chi, imitating Donald Knuth's usage in the scientific typesetting
language TeX (pronounced Tech), also preserving at least one of the
original three x's. Note also that the word archive itself goes
back to the greek "archos" for ruler, or "arche" to begin or rule,
where "archeion" was the government house, and led to the latin
"archivum" as a place where public records or historical documents
were preserved -- hence it was natural for what is now arXiv to

Physics section of the archives will be reorganized to bridge the

archive will be subsumed into a new "Mathematical Physics" archive
math-ph@xxx.lanl.gov , to which future submissions should be sent.
(If you are not sure whether or not your submission is physics,
then it should be sent to math-ph). Submissions will also
automatically appear under a "MP = Mathematical Physics" subject
class of the math archive, and as usual can be cross-listed
elsewhere. Current e-mail subscribers to "Mathematical Methods in
Physics" will automatically be subscribed to the new archive.

<dd>In order to facilitate feeding the european mirrors each night
before the transatlantic links become congested, daily mailings and
update of the web interface will now commence at 22:00 U.S.
Mountain time Sunday through Thursday (currently 04:00 GMT Monday
through Friday), i.e. two hours earlier. The deadline for
submissions remains 18:00 US Mountain time (i.e., currently 00:00
GMT, and 01:00 GMT during the winter) Sunday through Thursday.</dd>

<dd>e-mail subscribers to the physics archives: note that by
subscribing to the corresponding subject classes of the new
"physics" archive, you have the option to receive a single combined
daily mailing (e.g. hep-th, gr-qc, and cond-mat). The option to
receive separate mailings will of course remain. For further
instructions, e-mail To: physics@xxx.lanl.gov, Subject:
subscribe<br />

keyword subject classification), see http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/</dd>

<dd>Experimental mirror sites are now operating in France, 
<a href="http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/">http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/</a>
(Paris VI) and the U.K., 
<a href="http://xxx.soton.ac.uk/">http://xxx.soton.ac.uk/</a> (Southampton)
joining the existing mirrors in Germany (
<a href="http://xxx.uni-augsburg.de/">http://physinfo.uni-augsburg.de/</a>)
and Italy (
<a href="http://xxx.sissa.it/">http://babbage.sissa.it/</a>) and Japan (
<a href="http://xxx.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/">xxx.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp</a>).
The latter two will soon be upgraded, and additional mirror sites
are anticipated within the next few months. The goal is a more
robust global server system (to avoid relapse to the medieval days
when hardcopy took days, weeks, or months to arrive...)</dd>

<dt>24 Sep</dt>

<dd>On 1 Oct '96, a new "physics" archive will go on-line, and is
intended to facilitate growth into areas not currently covered.
Submissions will be required to have a Subj-class: field that will
effectively keyword partition the archive (for subscriptions,
listings, and searches). Existing archives will for the most part
remain unaffected. A very provisional list of canonical
subject-classes be found at http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/physics.html ,
and can be modified as needed. Constructive suggestions
solicited.</dd>

<h4>August 1996</h4>

<dt>4 Aug</dt>

<dd>Minor policy change: the deadline for submissions to appear in
the daily mailings has been moved six hours earlier to 18:00 US
Mountain time (i.e., currently 00:00 GMT, and 01:00 GMT during the
winter) Sunday through Thursday. The mailings will continue to
commence (and web interface updated) shortly after midnight on
those days (i.e., currently 06:00 GMT Mon-Fri, and 07:00 GMT during
winter). Those few submissions received between 18:00 and midnight
mountain time will appear in the next day's mailing. For the most
part, this change will be invisible (and will primarily affect late
night submissions from the US east coast, sparing us all the 2 a.m.
typos...).</dd>
