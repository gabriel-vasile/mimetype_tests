<br><b>Notes:</b>
The reproductive system, karyotype and meiotic sequences of four species of cochineal insects (<b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> spp.), three wild <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> sp1, <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> and <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> sp.2) and one cultivated <b><i>D. coccus</i></b> were studied. Testis and ovaries were stained with lacto-acetic-orcein 2%. Chromosome preparations were made using the squash technique. The reproductive system is sexual with both sexes diploid but physiologically haploid males. The chromosomes number in the wild species is 2n=10; four pairs of short and one pair of large chromosomes, the latter about three times the length of the short ones. The chromosome number of <b><i>C. coccus</i></b> is 2n=16; all of which are relatively short. The sum of the length of the four shortest chromosomes of <b><i>D. coccus</i></b> is similar to the length of the longest chromosome of the wild species. The length of the chromosome complement is similar in the four species. The meiotic sequence observed in these four cochineal species is of the <b><i>Comstockiella</i></b> type.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
The habit of inducing plant galls has evolved multiple times among insects but most species diversity occurs in only a few groups, such as gall midges and gall wasps. This phylogenetic clustering may reflect adaptive radiations in insect groups in which the trait has evolved. Alternatively, multiple independent origins of galling may suggest a selective advantage to the habit. We use DNA sequence data to examine the origins of galling among the most speciose group of gall-inducing scale insects, the eriococcids. We determine that the galling habit has evolved multiple times, including four times in Australian taxa, suggesting that there has occurred on Myrtaceae, we found that lineages feeding on Myrtaceae are no more likely to have evolved the galling habit than those feeding on other plant groups. However, most gall-inducing eriococcid species occur on Myrtaceae, we found that lineages feeding on Myrtaceae are no more likely to have evolved the galling habit than those feeding on other plant groups. However, most gall-inducing species-richness is clustered in only two clades (<b><i>Apiomorpha</i></b> and <b><i>Lachnodius + Opisthoscelis</i></b>), all of which occur exclusively on <b><i>Eucalyptus</i></b> s.s. The Eriococcidae and large genus <b><i>Eriococcus</i></b> were determined to be non-monophyletic and each will require revision.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
[Ph.D. Thesis.] Field and laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the biology, ecology, and population dynamics of the native cochineal insect <b><i>Dactylopius confusus</i></b> (Cockerell) (Homoptera: Dactylopiidae) and the insect's potential as a biological control agent for pricklypear, <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> spp. (Cactaceae). Development, survivorship, and reproduction of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> were monitored at constant temperatures of 26(DEGREES) and 22(DEGREES)C. Development was more rapid and fecundity was greater at 26(DEGREES) than at 22(DEGREES), but percent survival was similar at both temperatures. Generation time, T(,c), was 61 days at 26(DEGREES) and 83 days at 22(DEGREES). Net reproductive rate, R(,o), was 201 at 26(DEGREES) and 141 at 22(DEGREES). Spatial distributions of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> and its hosts, <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> spp., were aggregated. Approximately one-third of the plants were infested by <b><i>D. confusus</i></b>. Colonies occurred more often near the plant base and in areas of dense grass cover. Both <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> and the similar native cochineal, <b><i>D. opuntiae</i></b> (Cockerell), exhibited distinct differences in survival and generation time on different <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> hosts. Of nine <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> species/semispecies evaluated, four were comparable hosts for <b><i>D. confusus</i></b>, one resulted in less survival, and four gave low survival or were not suitable hosts. <b><i>D. opuntiae</i></b> survived equally well on four hosts but also adequately utilized the other five hosts. Dactylopiid generation time was inversely related to host suitability for most insect/host relationships examined. The primary limiting factor to <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> density was predation. The most abundant predator was <b><i>Laetilia coccidivora</i></b> (Comstock) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and two common predators were <b><i>Leucopis bellula</i></b> Williston (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae) and <b><i>Hyperaspis trifurcata</i></b> Schaeffer (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). When predators were excluded, <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> density increased significantly, resulting in increases in <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> mortality and reductions in new growth. No parasites or pathogens of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> were found. Abundance of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> on a range site subjected to prescribed burning increased during the first postburn season but was similar to that on an unburned site in subsequent seasons. Reductions in pricklypear infestation during the first postburn season appeared to result more from fire damage than from increased <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> population density. Application of insecticides to deter predators had no effect on <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> density.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
[Special Issue: Proceedings of the ISSIS VIII International Symposium on Scale Insect Studies held at Wye College (U.K.), Aug. 31st - Sept. 6th, 1998.] Scale insects of the genus <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> Costa, which all feed on cacti, are commonly called cochineal insects. Currently there are nine described species placed in their own family, the Dactylopiidae, based on a few unique morphological features. Here we review available biological, morphological and karyotype information on <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> and report on cladistic analyses of morphological data (from first-instar nymphs plus adult females, and adult males separately) and molecular data (from the nuclear gene 18S rDNA and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase II) from <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> and its potential relatives. We suggest that <b><i>Dactylopius</i></b> belongs with the eriococcids and we discuss the nomenclatural implications of this placement.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
[Special Issue: Proceedings of the ISSIS VIII International Symposium on Scale Insect Studies held at Wye College (U.K.), Aug. 31st - Sept. 6th, 1998.] An evaluation of the haemocytes in the cochineal scale, <b><i>Dactylopius confusus</i></b> (Cockerell), was completed and compared with those found in the mealybugs <b><i>Phenacoccus gossypii</i></b> Townsend & Cockerell and <b><i>Pseudococcus longispinus</i></b> (Targioni Tozzetti) to assess the potential sites of the dye pigment source. Four basic cell types were found in the two pseudococcids and five in the cochineal scale. The cell types common to all species included: prohaemocytes, oenocytoids, typical granulocytes and plasmatocytes. In addition, a modified granulocyte (poly-glyco-based granulocyte) was found to be specific to the cochineal scale and this produced rough endoplasmic reticulum derived granules that may be the source for the synthesis of carminic acid.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
This paper reviews the status of the diversity of the Dactylopiidae family, its hosts and predators in Mexico. Six dactylopiids or carmine cochineals are cited to occur in Mexico: <b><i>Dactylopius bassi, D. ceylonicus, D. coccus, D. confusus, D. opuntiae</i></b> and <b><i>D. tomentosus</i></b>. However, the diversity of Mexican dactylopiids may be higher as more regions and hosts are surveyed, since more than 114 <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> species occur in Mexico. Approximately 30 <b><i>Opuntia</i></b> species are known as hosts and four insect orders are reported as entomophagous of the Dactylopiidae family in Mexico. The difficulty involved in the identification of dactylopiids using only morphologic keys, may be overcome with molecular studies.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
The waxy secretions of scale insects (Homoptera: Coccoidea) and their chemical composition are reviewed. The contents include: the main types of the wax covers of the scale insect; the major methods used for studying the chemistry of waxy secretions; the species of the scale insects whose waxes have been studied; the main chemical composition such as waxes, hydrocarbons, resinous materials or terpenoids, pigments and interior honeydew are emphasized. Finally, the significance and application prospects of the waxes of scale insects are discussed in three aspects, such as to further develop the waxes of the scale insects as an important biological resource; to search for some new pesticides active against the scale insects; to develop biological control through application of some chemical components as infochemicals for inducing the natural enemies and to study the chemical classification of the scale insects by using the waxes as chemical characters.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
The growth of the cochineal insect (<b><i>Dactylopius confusus</i></b>) in the hot, dry valley, southern subtropical zone and mid subtropical zone was studied by using life tables and sample testing. Results show that cochineal insects growing in the southern subtropical zone were the largest. The eggs and weight of female adults were intermediate and the population trend index was the highest. The mid subtropical zone was a good place for breeding the cochineal, and the insect bred in this zone was the largest and heaviest, the life cycle was the longest and there were fewer generations per year. Although the cochineal occurred in the hot, dry tropical zone, the female adult was very small and light, so the tropical zone was not the ideal place for breeding the cochineal. In every climate zone, the key factors that affected the size of the cochineal population were unhatched eggs and strong rain during the 1st and 2nd instar. Mass natural enemies were not in any of the zones.

<br><b>Notes:</b>
Cochineal (<b><i>Dactylopius confusus</i></b>) was cultured on cacti collected from 10 counties. The growth of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> was optimum on <b><i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i></b>, although <b><i>O. tuna</i></b> and <b><i>O. stricta</i></b> were also good hosts for the insect. Insect growth was observed on <b><i>O. ficus-indica</i></b> imported from Peru, but growth was more pronounced on native plants from Lufeng county, Yunnan, China. The spineless cacti were better hosts than the spiny cacti. Insect growth was negatively correlated with the thickness of the epidermis of the cacti. <b><i>D. confusus</i></b> stimulated the development of the vascular bundles of the plants. The protein and water contents of the plants had significant effects on the growth of <b><i>D. confusus</i></b>.
