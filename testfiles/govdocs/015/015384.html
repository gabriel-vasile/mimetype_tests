                        Summary</strong> </p>
                      <p align="left">Aquaculture has expanded rapidly in the 
                        Southern United States during the past two decades, especially 
                        the cultivation of catfish, crawfish, and bait fish. These 
                        fish usually are cultivated on farms with extensive systems 
                        of large shallow ponds that are highly susceptible to 
                        predation by birds. Double-crested cormorants (<em>Phalacrocorax 
                        auritus</em>), American white pelicans (<em>Pelecanus 
                        erythrorhynchos</em>), wading birds (e.g., <em>Ardea alba</em>, 
                        <em>Ardea herodius</em>), and scaup (<em>Aythya</em> spp.) 
                        are among the birds most frequently implicated. Well-documented 
                        problems associated with cormorant predation on catfish 
                        farms have coincided with the increase of this industry 
                        and the rapid growth of cormorant breeding populations 
                        on northern breeding grounds. From 1995 to 1998, the number 
                        of cormorants spending the winter in the catfish production 
                        region of Mississippi has more than doubled and now exceeds 
                        60,000 birds. Also in 1998, cormorants were discovered 
                        breeding in Mississippi and Arkansas for the first time 
                        in decades. Without human intervention, breeding populations 
                        in the Great Lakes will likely continue to increase, resulting 
                        in more habitat destruction, competition with other colonial 
                        waterbirds, competition with sport fishermen, and depredations 
                        on southern aquaculture farms. </p>
                      <p align="left">The nature and expansiveness of southern 
                        aquaculture and the continued growth of cormorant populations 
                        limit options for managing depredations on aquaculture 
                        farms. Most efforts rely on devices designed to frighten 
                        them from ponds and roosts, although the effectiveness 
                        of this strategy is limited and, due to expanding habitat 
                        utilization by cormorants, is becoming increasingly difficult 
                        to implement. In the long-term, further research may lead 
                        to the development of barriers, new fish-culturing practices, 
                        or other techniques that may help alleviate problems in 
                        certain situations. However, no such strategies seem promising 
                        at this time and may be limited in the future by the rapid 
                        proliferation of this species. In the short term, lethal 
                        control strategies under the current cormorant depredation 
                        order may need to be implemented to their fullest extent 
                        at aquaculture facilities and may need to be expanded 
                        to roosting sites to reinforce harassment strategies. 
                        Authority should also be pursued to manage southern breeding 
                        colonies at levels compatible with aquaculture to forestall 
                        future depredation problems. However, such localized population 
                        control efforts are unlikely to affect continental or 
                        flyway populations, and problems are likely to grow as 
                        long as the interior population grows. Managers should 
                        consider managing cormorant populations on a flyway basis, 
                        which will require setting biologically and socially acceptable 
                        population goals and evaluating management options for 
                        achieving these goals. Construction of a realistic, deterministic 
                        population model for cormorants would facilitate these 
                        ends. Increased dialog among public agencies and private 
                        organizations concerned about the management and conservation 
                        of cormorants is critical to the development of a realistic 
                        and effective plan for managing the depredations caused 
                        by this species. </p>

                      <p align="left">Populations of double-crested cormorants 
                        (<em>Phalacrocorax auritus</em>) have irrupted during 
                        the past two decades and are of increasing concern to 
                        commercial aquaculturists in the Southern United States, 
                        commercial and sport fishermen on the Great Lakes and 
                        in the Northeastern United States, and conservationists 
                        worried about habitat destruction and impacts to other 
                        waterbirds. In response to these concerns, this document 
                        was prepared for the Eastern Regional Office of USDA-WS 
                        based, in part, on a previous planning document that was 
                        a collaborative effort of the following current and former 
                        USDA-WS personnel: Keith Andrews, Jerry Belant, Travis

                        provide an overview of double-crested cormorant conflicts 
                        with southern aquaculture and concerns with cormorants 
                        elsewhere; 2) review the effectiveness and limitations

                        research needs and management actions: and 4) develop 
                        a systematic plan to meet research needs and set a course

                        From a research perspective we attempt to define what 
                        information is needed to formulate sound management decisions. 
                        It is intended to facilitate thought, discussion, and 
                        partnerships among wildlife and fishery biologists, aquaculturists, 
                        conservationists, and the public regarding how these conflicts

                      <p align="left">Various governmental agencies and private 
                        individuals share responsibility for managing wildlife 
                        damage problems, depending on the type of problem species 
                        involved and where the problems occur. The U.S. Fish and 
                        Wildlife Service (USDI-FWS) is the primary governmental 
                        agency responsible for managing migratory birds and federally 
                        threatened and endangered species. State agencies manage 
                        most other wildlife species and share in the management 
                        of migratory birds. State and federal wildlife management 
                        agencies often share responsibilities with other state 
                        and federal agriculture, land management, and health agencies. 
                        Private organizations and wildlife damage control businesses 
                        may receive authority from governmental agencies to directly 
                        manage specific wildlife problems. </p>
                      <p align="left">The USDI-FWS has statutory authority for 
                        enforcing the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712) 
                        and thus for managing cormorant populations. However, 
                        the agency exercises this authority in consultation with 
                        other federal, state, and provincial agencies. Under the 
                        Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931, as amended 
                        (7 U.S.C. 426-426c; 46 Stat. 1468), the USDA-WS program 
                        is responsible for protecting American agriculture and 
                        other resources from damage caused by wildlife, including 
                        cormorants. </p>
                      <p align="left">USDA-WS may implement localized depredation 
                        abatement actions, but must consult with USDI-FWS and 
                        state agencies to implement more far-reaching management 
                        actions. </p>
                      <p align="left">As part of their authority to manage cormorant 
                        populations, the USDI-FWS previously issued depredation 
                        permits that allowed individual aquaculture producers 
                        to shoot cormorants that were causing or about to cause 
                        damage on their farms. USDA-WS assisted in this process 
                        by certifying that cormorants were in fact causing damage 
                        and that nonlethal means were insufficient to reduce damages. 
                        In March 1998, the USDI-FWS issued a Standing Depredation 
                        Order (50 CFR, Part 21, Section 21.47) that eliminated 
                        the requirement that producers obtain individual permits 
                        and enabled fish farmers in 13 states to shoot double-crested 
                        cormorants that are committing or about to commit damage 
                        at their farms. Some states still require individual permits. 
                        The present cormorant depredation order does not restrict 
                        the number of cormorants that may be shot nor the methods 
                        that may be used to bring birds within shooting range. 
                        Under these provisions, farmers must keep a log of the 
                        numbers of cormorants killed each month and make these 
                        logs available to wildlife enforcement officials. </p>

                        Aquaculture </strong></p>
                      <p align="left">Aquaculture is the intensive commercial 
                        propagation of various fish, crawfish (crayfish) (<em>Procambarus 
                        clarkii, P. acutus</em>), or shrimp (<em>Family Pennaeidae</em>). 
                        Southern aquaculture is devoted primarily to the culture 
                        of catfish (<em>Ictaluridae</em>), bait fish (<em>Cyprinidae</em>), 
                        and crawfish in large (&gt; 2 ha) shallow (&lt; 2 m) ponds 
                        and is located primarily in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, 
                        Louisiana, and Mississippi. Most production of channel 
                        catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is concentrated in Mississippi, 
                        which has more than 41,000 ha of ponds and is responsible 
                        for 70 percent of the domestic commercial production. 
                        Arkansas ranks second, with over 9,000 ha of catfish ponds. 
                        Alabama and Louisiana rank third and fourth, respectively. 
                        More than 90 percent of all catfish production in the 
                        United States occurs in these four states (USDA 1998). 
                        Arkansas raises approximately 80 percent of all cultured 
                        bait fish in the United States, having almost 12,000 ha 
                        in production (Collins 1995). Almost all crawfish are 
                        produced in Louisiana, which has more than 40,000 ha of 
                        ponds in production (Avery and Lutz 1996). </p>
                      <p align="left">Although southern aquaculture farms vary 
                        greatly in size, a typical Mississippi catfish farm has 
                        20 ponds, each containing about 6 surface hectares of 
                        water. Because of the size of bait fish and crawfish and 
                        multi-batch cropping systems with catfish, almost all 
                        ponds are vulnerable to predation. Both bait fish and 
                        catfish ponds are stocked at extremely high densities 
                        ranging from 5,000 to 150,000 fish/ha with catfish and 
                        123,000 to almost 500,000 fish/ha with bait fish. Such 
                        crowding make fish highly susceptible to bird predation, 
                        particularly by cormorants. </p>
                      <p align="left">Southern aquaculture production has seen 
                        phenomenal growth in the past 30 years, due mostly to 
                        the expansion of the catfish industry. In both Mississippi 
                        and Arkansas, the first crops were raised in a few ponds 
                        in the early 1960s. The industry expanded in the delta 
                        region of Mississippi from the mid-1970s through the 1980s, 
                        when the acreage increased almost tenfold. In the early 
                        1990s this growth slowed due to low market prices but 
                        resumed again in 1996 when acreage increased by 4 percent 
                        in both Mississippi and Arkansas (USDA 1996). Continued 
                        increases were observed in 1997 (USDA 1997) in the four 
                        major production states. The additional acreage in recent 
                        times has come from expansion of existing farms in the 
                        delta region of Mississippi and rapid expansion of catfish 
                        farming in areas such as east Mississippi. Crawfish production 
                        has also increased. Between 1960 and 1996, commercial 
                        crawfish acreage in Louisiana increased from 800 ha to 
                        45,000 ha (J. Avery, Louisiana Coop. Ext. Service. Pers. 
                        Commun.). Overall, aquaculture is the fastest growing 
                        agricultural enterprise in the United States (Van Gorder 
                        1992) and by the year 2000, is predicted to account for 
                        $59 billion, or 40 percent of the world's fish production 
                        (Price and Nickum 1995). </p>

                      <p align="left">Historical trends reveal several factors 
                        affecting the fluctuation in cormorant populations. Cormorant 
                        populations were suppressed during the early 1900s due 
                        to egg collecting for human food and nest destruction 
                        by fishermen who considered the cormorant to be a competitor 
                        (Lewis 1929, Hatch 1984, Dolbeer 1990, Chapdelaine and 
                        B&eacute;dard 1995). From the 1920s through mid-1940s, 
                        population increases throughout the Great Lakes, New England, 
                        and Canada (Baillie 1947, Fargo and Van Tyne 1927, Hatch 
                        1984, Postupalsky 1978) were probably due to newly-created 
                        reservoirs that killed trees and created new islands for 
                        nesting (Markhan and Brechtel 1978). </p>
                      <p align="left">Cormorants are highly susceptible to pollutants 
                        bioaccumulated by prey fish species, and pesticide-related 
                        bill deformities continue to occur (Fox et al. 1991, Ludwig 
                        et al. 1996). From the mid-1940s through the early 1970s, 
                        human persecution, human competition for fish resources, 
                        but most importantly widespread use of environmental contaminants 
                        (e.g., organo-chlorine compounds) led to a decline of 
                        cormorant populations (Noble and Elliott 1986, Craven 
                        and Lev 1987, Ludwig et al. 1989, Dolbeer 1990, Weseloh 
                        et al. 1995). During this period, the Great Lakes cormorant 
                        population as a whole suffered a reduction in excess of 
                        80 percent (Postupalsky 1978) due to eggshell thinning 
                        and reproductive failure attributed to pesticide deposition 
                        (e.g., DDT/DDE) (Postupalsky 1978, Weseloh et al. 1983, 
                        Weseloh et al. 1995). In addition, between 1944 and 1952, 
                        the USDI-FWS incorporated cormorant egg-spraying into 
                        a herring gull (<em>Larus argentatus</em>) reduction effort 
                        in New England, primarily targeting cormorant colonies 
                        in Maine (Gross 1952). A cormorant control program was 
                        initiated on Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba, in 1945 that 
                        reduced the colony from 9,862 to 4,656 nests by 1951 (McLeod 
                        and Bondar 1953). </p>
                      <p align="left">Protected status was granted to cormorants 
                        in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
                        in 1972. That event, combined with DDT use restrictions 
                        implemented in the mid-1970s, contributed to the resurgence 
                        of cormorant populations (Bishop et al. 1992, Ludwig 1984, 
                        Noble and Elliott 1986, Tyson et al. 1999). A dramatic 
                        increase in food availability (e.g., alewife [Alosa pseudoharengus]), 
                        particularly in the Great Lakes, has also aided this recovery 
                        (Hobson et al. 1989, Price and Weseloh 1986, Weseloh et 
                        al. 1995). An annual increase in cormorant breeding pairs 
                        has been reported for the following areas: southern New 
                        England (20 percent), the Canadian lower Great Lakes (about 
                        40 percent from 1976-1990), and the entire Great Lakes 
                        (29 percent from 1970-1991) (Hatch 1984, Blokpoel and 
                        Tessier 1991, Weseloh et al. 1995). Cormorants also began 
                        to colonize areas south of their traditional range (Post 
                        and Seals 1991). Overall, the cormorant nesting population 
                        in the Great Lakes increased from 89 nesting pairs in 
                        1970 to about 93,000 pairs in 1997 (Tyson et al. 1999). 
                        Between 1986 and 1989, recently established breeding populations 
                        in South Carolina increased 310 percent from 60 nesting 
                        pair to 186 nesting pairs (Post and Seals 1991). Concurrent 
                        with the rapid growth of cormorant populations in North 
                        America, great cormorant (<em>Phalacrocorax carbo</em>) 
                        populations in Europe experienced a similarly dramatic 
                        resurgence largely due to increased protection and restrictions 
                        on persistent pesticides (Veldkamp 1997). The similar 
                        life history and conflicts caused by great cormorants 
                        provide insight into management issues with double-crested 
                        cormorants. </p>
                      <p align="left">Most double-crested cormorants that affect 
                        southern aquaculture breed in the Northern United States 
                        and Canada (Dolbeer 1991), although flocks of cormorants 
                        have been observed in the delta region of Mississippi 
                        during the summer and small breeding colonies have recently 
                        been documented in Mississippi (Reinhold et al. 1998) 
                        and Arkansas (Thurmond Booth, Wildlife Services, Pers. 
                        Commun.). Up to 70 percent of cormorants banded at nesting 
                        colonies from Saskatchewan through the Great Lakes prior 
                        to 1988 were recovered in the lower Mississippi River 
                        Valley (Dolbeer 1991). This breeding area encompasses 
                        most of what is referred to as the &quot;interior population,&quot; 
                        that makes up 61 percent of the total North American breeding 
                        population, recently estimated between 1 and 2 million 
                        birds (Hatch 1995, Tyson et al. 1999). Past band recovery 
                        analyses reveal no apparent &quot;focal point&quot; of 
                        breeding birds that conflict with southern aquaculture 
                        (Dolbeer 1991), but it seems clear that the conflict involves 
                        birds associated with the Mississippi flyway. A more up-to-date 
                        analysis of band recoveries is needed to begin to understand 
                        current movements along this flyway. </p>
                      <p align="left">Increased winter survival of juveniles due 
                        to a higher forage base provided by catfish may have contributed 
                        to this growth (Duffy 1995, Vermeer and Rankin 1984, Weseloh 
                        and Ewins 1994). A recent study has confirmed that premigratory 
                        cormorants from the delta region of Mississippi are in 
                        better body condition than cormorants from non-aquacultural 
                        areas (Glahn et al. 1999). Cormorant mortality has been 
                        estimated at 50 to 70 percent during the first year after 
                        hatching and 15 to 25 percent annually thereafter (Hickey 
                        1952, Palmer 1962, van de Veen 1973). Price and Weseloh 
                        (1986) suggest a pre-breeding mortality (up to age 3) 
                        of 70 percent in stable populations and 31 percent in 
                        expanding populations; van de Veen (1973) reports survival 
                        to breeding age as 30 percent in the stable western population. 
                      </p>
                      <p align="left">Historically, human activities have been 
                        the primary cause of cormorant population fluctuations, 
                        including the current population resurgence. Most notable 
                        has been the rise and fall of persistent pesticides in 
                        the environment, the protection afforded the species, 
                        and the recent increase of the food base on the wintering 
                        grounds provided by southern aquaculture. Although it 
                        is impossible to accurately predict future trends in cormorant 
                        populations, there is little evidence that populations 
                        will decline markedly without human intervention. Density-dependent 
                        factors could lead to eventual stabilization of the population, 
                        albeit at a high level. This has been demonstrated, in 
                        part, through population modeling of the great cormorant 
                        populations in Europe (Bregenballe et al. 1997). In North 
                        America, density dependent factors might limit the size 
                        of some individual breeding colonies, but available breeding 
                        habitat for further colonization remains abundant (Hatch 
                        and Weseloh 1998). Prey can become depleted for individual 
                        cormorant breeding colonies (Birt et al. 1987; Hatch and 
                        Weseloh 1998), but range-wide reduction in the availability 
                        of prey is unlikely. Although epizootic diseases may help 
                        regulate localized populations, additional research is 
                        needed to clarify the potential for diseases to limit 
                        population growth throughout the entire range. Recent 
                        outbreaks of Newcastle's disease (<em>avian paramyxovirus</em>) 
                        may have slowed the growth of some established breeding 
                        colonies (Hatch 1995); however, no viable cultures were 
                        isolated from exposed birds (M. Avery, NWRC, per. commun.) 
                        even though more than half of the wintering birds examined 
                        in a recent ongoing study had been exposed to this disease 
                        organism. </p>

                      <p align="left">The increasing conflict between cormorants 
                        and southern aquaculture has been chronicled through population 
                        trends of wintering cormorants in areas of intensive aquaculture. 
                        With the expansion of Mississippi aquaculture in the 1980s 
                        came a corresponding increase in the number of cormorants 
                        spending the winter in this region (Glahn and Stickley 
                        1995). Prior to 1980, few cormorants remained there for 
                        the winter (Glahn and Stickley 1995). However, during 
                        the 1980s, the number of cormorants recorded during Christmas 
                        bird counts increased dramatically (Glahn and Stickley 
                        1995, Jackson and Jackson 1995). Since 1990, mid-winter 
                        counts of this species doubled from approximately 30,000 
                        birds in 1990, when USDA-WS biologists began conducting 
                        roosts censuses, to 67,000 birds in 1998 (Glahn et al. 
                        2000). These counts have remained approximately at 1998 
                        levels through 2000 (USDA-WS files). Less is known about 
                        wintering cormorants in other aquaculture production areas, 
                        but recent midwinter counts suggest populations of approximately 
                        10,000 birds inhabit the rapidly expanding aquaculture 
                        region of East Mississippi and West Alabama. In the catfish 
                        production region of Arkansas, surveys in February 2000 
                        revealed 50,000 cormorants roosting in several different 
                        roost sites (M. Hoy, USDA-WS, Pers. Commun.). Despite 
                        the value of these counts as indices to potential conflicts, 
                        little is known about overall cormorant populations that 
                        might utilize southern aquaculture production areas over 
                        time. However, banding records indicate approximately 
                        120,000 birds were moving through the lower Mississippi 
                        valley in 1989 (Dolbeer 1990). Considering the increased 
                        breeding populations since that time, this number may 
                        have more than doubled. </p>
                      <p align="left">Cormorants traditionally arrive on their 
                        wintering grounds in November and depart by mid-April 
                        (Aderman and Hill 1995). However, appreciable numbers 
                        now arrive in September and do not depart until late April 
                        or early May (Reinhold and Sloan in press), thus extending 
                        the period of depredations. These wintering birds congregate 
                        at night in bald cypress (<em>Taxodium distichum</em>) 
                        or tupelo gum (<em>Nyssa aquatica</em>) trees that are 
                        typically over water in oxbow lakes or other naturally 
                        occurring wetlands associated with river drainages (Aderman 
                        and Hill 1995, Glahn et al. 1996). From a dynamic number 
                        of active night roost sites, cormorants travel only a 
                        mean distance of 16 km to forage on catfish ponds (King 
                        et al. 1995). Thus, depredations are temporarily highly 
                        concentrated on ponds in close proximity to active roost 
                        sites, but shifts in roosting activity (King 1996) cause 
                        depredations to be a widespread problem. </p>
                      <p align="left">The impact of cormorant foraging activity 
                        on the catfish industry has been well documented but their 
                        impact on bait fish and crawfish remains unclear. Most 
                        catfish producers in the Southern United States perceive 
                        cormorants as threats to their livelihood (Stickley and 
                        Andrews 1989, Wywialowski 1999). In a 1996 national survey 
                        of catfish producers, depredations by cormorants were 
                        the most commonly cited wildlife problem. Losses due to 
                        cormorants were cited by 77 percent of Mississippi producers, 
                        66 percent of Arkansas producers, and 50 percent of Alabama 
                        producers. The main problems reported were cormorants 
                        feeding on catfish, injuring catfish, and disturbing feeding 
                        patterns. Losses reported from all depredating species 
                        approximated 4 percent of catfish sales, or a 16 to 33 
                        percent loss of profits (Wywialowski 1999). </p>
                      <p align="left">Observational studies of cormorants foraging 
                        at catfish ponds were the first concrete evidence of their 
                        potential to impact catfish production. The smaller subspecies 
                        of Florida cormorants were observed feeding at a fingerling 
                        catfish pond at an estimated a consumption rate of 19 
                        fingerlings/bird/day, or approximately 304 g/bird/day 
                        (Schramm et al. 1984). Hodges (1989) only rarely observed 
                        cormorants on catfish ponds but concluded that they pose 
                        the greatest threat to catfish farmers because of their 
                        gregarious behavior and ability to dive for fish. It has 
                        been calculated that 30 cormorants feeding throughout 
                        the day would consume half of the fingerling population 
                        in an 8-ha pond in 167 days (Stickley et al. 1992). In 
                        a recent study, captive cormorants consumed 516 to 608 
                        g, or about 10 catfish, per day (Glahn unpubl. data). 
                        These findings are consistent with previous bioenergetic 
                        projections for these birds (Glahn and Brugger 1995) and 
                        based on replacement costs indicate that one cormorant 
                        subsisting exclusively on catfish would remove about $1 
                        worth of fingerlings per day. </p>
                      <p align="left">Food habits studies have also documented 
                        the prevalence of catfish in the diet of cormorants on 
                        their winter range. A 3-year study found that approximately 
                        half of the cormorant diet (wt/wt) in the delta region 
                        of Mississippi was composed of channel catfish (Glahn 
                        et al. 1995). Most of the remaining diet was gizzard shad 
                        (<em>Dorosoma cepedianum</em>). Catfish were most often 
                        consumed during the spring months in areas with the highest 
                        concentration of fish farms. Catfish consumed in this 
                        study averaged 16 cm in length, equivalent to the average 
                        size fingerlings stocked by producers. </p>
                      <p align="left">For the winters of 1989-90 and 1990-91, 
                        a bioenergetics model estimated cormorant-related production 
                        losses on catfish farms in the delta region of Mississippi 
                        at 18 to 20 million fingerlings per winter, or approximately 
                        4 percent of the available fingerling-class during the 
                        November to April study periods (Glahn and Brugger 1995). 
                        The annual cost of replacing these fingerlings was estimated 
                        at approximately $2 million. Cormorant populations in 
                        the delta region of Mississippi have more than doubled 
                        since this study, and the annual impact of cormorants 
                        on the catfish industry in the Mississippi delta may now 
                        exceed $5 million (Glahn et al. 2000). Based on the estimated 
                        value of these fish at harvest, actual production losses 
                        might be 10 times greater, but more study was needed to 
                        assess whether losses due to predation are additive or 
                        compensatory as related to density-dependent growth and 
                        mortality of catfish. To partially address these questions 
                        one study (QA-634, in progress) is examining catfish production 
                        at harvest with and without cormorant predation simulating 
                        average cormorant numbers seen foraging by Stickley et 
                        al. (1992) on catfish ponds (i.e., 30 cormorants foraging 
                        on a 6 ha pond for 100 days). Also to simulate field conditions, 
                        an ample supply of buffer prey was provided along with 
                        catfish fingerlings stocked at 12,355 fish/ha (5,000 fish/ac). 
                        Preliminary results suggest that despite the buffer prey 
                        reducing depredation on catfish by an estimated 33 percent, 
                        catfish population declines due to cormorant predation 
                        at harvest ranged from 26 to 33 percent where catastrophic 
                        disease problems did not occur. Because of density-dependant 
                        compensatory growth, actual biomass production loss ranged 
                        from 19 to 21 percent. Considering this 20 percent loss 
                        in production, losses at a commercial pond scale would 
                        be $10,500 or 5 times the value of the fingerlings lost. 
                        Because of small profit margins in the catfish industry, 
                        some agricultural economists suggest that a 20 percent 
                        loss in production would result in a 100 percent loss 
                        in profits (C. Engle University of Arkansas, Pers. Commun.).

                        Cormorant Conflicts </strong></p>
                      <p align="left">Controversy surrounding cormorants has polarized 
                        people (Shetterly 1986) whose views range from those who 
                        wish to declare cormorants a nuisance species in need 
                        of control (Arkansas Senate Bill 345 [1993], Arkansas 
                        Senate Concurrent Resolution 12 [1995], Bayer 1989, Oklahoma 
                        Senate Bill 362 [1991]) to those who feel that cormorant 
                        populations are causing no problems and have the right 
                        to recover to the fullest extent (Duffy 1995). Historically, 
                        animosity towards cormorants has been based on their perceived 
                        impact on fisheries (Lewis 1929, Mendall 1934, 1936) and 
                        has generated extended periods of intense persecution 
                        by commercial fishing interests (Baillie 1947, Craven 
                        and Lev 1987, Ludwig 1984, Omand 1947, Postupalsky 1978), 
                        at times leading to sanctioned efforts to reduce cormorant 
                        populations (Hatch 1995). Both sanctioned and unsanctioned 
                        reduction efforts have occurred at breeding colonies during 
                        the most recent build up of populations (Ewins and Weseloh 
                        1994, USDI-FWS 1998). These efforts have largely been 
                        justified by impacts on fisheries but have also been spurred 
                        by a growing concern about cormorant impacts on unique 
                        insular habitats and on other colonial nesting birds (B&egrave;dard 
                        et al. 1995). These latter concerns have recently lead 
                        natural resource managers in both the United States (Garland 
                        et al. 1998) and Canada (St. Martin and Loftus 2000) to 
                        express concern and either call for action or definitive 
                        studies to defend a control program. Consistent with these 
                        views, conservationists developing the North American 
                        Colonial Waterbird Conservation Plan have referred to 
                        cormorants as &quot;pests.&quot; Below, we briefly review 
                        the literature concerning these other cormorant conflicts. 
                      </p>
                      <p align="left">Research to clarify the impact of cormorants 
                        on sport or commercial fisheries has yielded mixed results. 
                        Most studies, principally in the Great Lakes region, indicate 
                        that cormorants feed primarily on abundant small forage 
                        fish in these ecosystems, namely alewife and shad (Lewis 
                        1929, Mendall 1936, Omand 1947, Craven and Lev 1987, Ludwig 
                        et al. 1989, Weseloh et al. 1995). More recent and detailed 
                        studies on Lake Erie (Bur et al. 1999) and Lake Ontario 
                        (Ross and Johnson 1999) concluded that cormorants usually 
                        did not have a significant impact on either game fish 
                        or their forage base. However, cormorants on Lake Champlain 
                        consumed primarily yellow perch, a preferred sport fish 
                        in Vermont (Garland et al. 1998). </p>
                      <p align="left">Cormorants can have a direct impact on fisheries 
                        during stocking, such as when trout or salmon are released 
                        into rivers (Blackwell et al. 1997, Derby and Lovvorn 
                        1997, Meister and Gramlich 1967, Ross and Johnson 1999). 
                        Cormorants can also reduce sports fisheries where forage 
                        prey such as alewife are less numerous. During a series 
                        of intensive investigations on the Eastern Basin of Lake 
                        Ontario (Schneider et al. 1998), cormorants shifted their 
                        diet to smallmouth bass when alewife and other prey species 
                        populations were low. Although smallmouth composed only 
                        a small percentage of the cormorant diet, specific age 
                        classes important to this fishery (primarily 3- to 5-year 
                        old fish) may have been significantly reduced. </p>
                      <p align="left">The resurgence in the interior cormorant 
                        population has spurred growing concern that migrating 
                        cormorants might adversely affect sport and commercial 
                        fisheries along the Upper Mississippi River, but limited 
                        data suggest that cormorants foraging in such areas take 
                        mainly gizzard shad (Kirsch 1995). Little scientific information 
                        is available on cormorant food habits on natural waters 
                        (e.g., rivers, lakes and reservoirs) in the Southern United 
                        States. Results of a study in Texas (Campo et al. 1993) 
                        indicated that most cormorants fishing in natural waters 
                        took mainly shad and sunfishes. Nonetheless, the researchers 
                        acknowledged that cormorants could have an impact on sport 
                        fish in some locations. Another study (Glahn et al. 1998) 
                        reported that cormorants foraging at lakes during winter 
                        in Mississippi and Alabama took mostly shad and sunfish, 
                        but recommended more in-depth studies of cormorant impact 
                        in southern waters. </p>
                      <p align="left">Based on a review of the literature and 
                        a survey of state agencies, Trapp et al. (1999) concluded 
                        that cormorants have only a minor impact on sport fish 
                        populations except in highly localized situations. This 
                        view may summarize the situation best as of now, but further 
                        research is needed to clarify this issue in areas where 
                        cormorants are concentrated. </p>
                      <p align="left">The impact of nesting cormorants on habitat 
                        and other colonial waterbirds is well documented in localized 
                        areas. Cormorants strip leaves, break branches, and deposit 
                        guano that ultimately kills the trees. The resulting habitat 
                        destruction is highly visible (Weseloh and Ewins 1994, 
                        B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, Jarvie et al. 1999, Shieldcastle 
                        and Martin 1999). Habitat destruction, combined with competition 
                        for nest sites, impacts black-crowned night herons (<em>Nycticorax 
                        nycticorax</em>) and other heron and egret species ( Jarvie 
                        et al. 1999, Shieldcastle and Martin 1999). Although these 
                        impacts seem localized at present, they are clearly density 
                        dependent and likely to be an increasing problem as cormorant 
                        populations continue to expand. </p>

                        Associated With Cormorants </strong></p>
                      <p align="left">The double-crested cormorant is a native 
                        species that is of intrinsic as well as esthetic value 
                        to humans. Cormorants are potential indicator species 
                        for environmental contaminants (Noble and Elliott 1986, 
                        Fox et al. 1991, Ludwig et al. 1995). Some aquaculture 
                        producers believe that cormorants are beneficial when 
                        they feed on undesirable fish such as gizzard shad (<em>Dorosoma 
                        cepedianum</em>) and sunfish (Lepomis sp.) that infest 
                        commercial ponds. Cormorants can increase species diversity 
                        on natural waters and reservoirs and may stabilize the 
                        relationship between predatory fish and their prey. Bird 
                        watchers enjoy viewing cormorants in their natural setting 
                        (B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, Mendall 1936, Vermeer 1970). 
                        Most aquaculturists recognize that some depredation is 
                        natural and to some degree is a cost of business (Thompson 
                        et al. 1995), but the threshold for acceptable depredation 
                        losses may have long since been exceeded. </p>

                        depends on the costs of deploying the strategy relative 
                        to the anticipated reduction in damage. Environmental, 
                        biological, social, physical, and legal considerations 
                        also influence the selection and application of management 
                        strategies (Owens and Slate 1991, Slate et al. 1992, USDA 
                        1994). Because each damage situation is unique, appropriate 
                        management actions must be determined on an individual 
                        basis. </p>

                        What are the behavioral traits of the wildlife? Is the

                      <p align="left">Alleviating wildlife damage entails employing 
                        one or a combination of three strategies: 1) managing 
                        the resource being impacted; 2) physically separating 
                        the wildlife from the resource; or 3) managing the wildlife 
                        responsible for, or associated with, the damage (USDA 
                        1994). Below we describe these strategies in more detail 
                        relative to catfish production and discuss research needs.

                      <p align="left">Managing a resource to reduce wildlife conflicts 
                        usually involves modifying cultural practices (e.g., animal 
                        husbandry or crop selection), altering the habitat to 
                        reduce its attractiveness to wildlife, or adjusting human 
                        behavior. In the case of aquaculture production, the objective 
                        would be to reduce the vulnerability of fish to predation 
                        by cormorants. </p>
                      <p align="left"><strong><em>Pond size and location</em></strong> 
                        - Smaller ponds would facilitate the installment and maintenance 
                        of bird exclusion structures, as well as improved management 
                        of fish diseases and water quality. However, production 
                        is typically reduced and levee maintenance costs are typically 
                        increased when smaller ponds are used. Pond construction 
                        costs, a major determinant of economic success in the 
                        industry, also increase as pond size decreases (Tucker 
                        and Robinson 1990). Changing pond depth probably would 
                        have no effect on cormorant foraging efficiency as the 
                        birds dive to depths &gt;20 m (Palmer 1962, Knopf and 
                        Kennedy 1981). Locating fingerling ponds or other ponds 
                        that are especially susceptible to predation near areas 
                        with human activity (e.g., warehouses, processing plants) 
                        or where they are easily accessible facilitates harassing 
                        birds and reduces susceptibility to predation (Mott and 
                        Boyd 1995). </p>
                      <p align="left"><em><strong>Cultural practices</strong></em> 
                        - Catfish ponds are managed either as multiple-cropping 
                        systems, which contain two or more size classes of fish 
                        and are selectively harvested over a period of years, 
                        or single-batch systems, which contain only one year class 
                        of fish and are completely harvested before restocking. 
                        All multi-crop ponds contain a fish size class that is 
                        vulnerable to predation by birds and must be protected. 
                        The vulnerability of single-crop ponds to predation varies 
                        depending on the size of fish. Thus, farms with the single-crop 
                        system usually have fewer ponds with vulnerable fish. 
                        The multi-cropping system was adopted by most catfish 
                        farmers to meet the needs of processors but has a number 
                        of disadvantages when compared to the single-batch system 
                        (Tucker and Robinson 1990). Although the industry is large 
                        enough now to assure year-round supplies of fish using 
                        single-batch culture (Tucker and Robinson 1990), most 
                        farmers continue to use the multi-batch culture so they 
                        can harvest fish throughout the year and improve their 
                        cash flow. </p>
                      <p align="left">Other modifications in fish stocking regimens 
                        have the potential to limit predation by cormorants. Barlow 
                        and Bock (1984), Brugger (1995), Glahn et al. (1995), 
                        and Mott and Boyd (1995) suggest that modifying stocking 
                        rates, size-class of fish stocked, or stocking times can 
                        reduce resource losses to birds. Reduced stocking rates 
                        might reduce the foraging success of cormorants and, in 
                        turn, reduce the attractiveness of catfish ponds (Mott 
                        and Boyd 1995). Conversely, the current industry trend 
                        is to use higher stocking rates that might compensate 
                        producers for production losses due to predation and other 
                        causes. Research is needed to determine optimal stocking 
                        rates with respect to bird predation that maintains acceptable 
                        profit margins. Delaying transfer of fingerlings into 
                        food-fish ponds would shorten the period when producers 
                        would need to protect these fish and allow more concentrated 
                        bird-control efforts at fewer fingerling ponds. By delaying 
                        restocking from late winter until mid-April, producers 
                        would miss the peak period of cormorant depredation (Glahn 
                        et al. 1995). However, delaying stocking is not consistent 
                        with the multi-batch cropping system and may increase 
                        the risk of stress-related mortality from disease due 
                        to water temperature changes. Also, because these fish 
                        are not expected to grow during the winter (Tucker and 
                        Robinson 1990), fall and winter stocking might not be 
                        cost-effective because it increases the period of exposure 
                        to cormorant predation in food-fish ponds. </p>
                      <p align="left">Other cultural practices to reduce cormorant 
                        predation might include the use of buffer prey and pond 
                        water dyes to reduce the visibility of fish to the cormorant 
                        (Mott and Boyd 1995). In studying the predation by cormorants 
                        on catfish ponds, Stickley et al. (1992) noticed that 
                        cormorants fed heavily on shad, which are more easily 
                        manipulated than catfish for swallowing. However, preliminary 
                        results of controlled captive cormorant studies suggest 
                        that over time, cormorants had no real preference for 
                        a more readily manipulated buffer prey (i.e. golden shiners) 
                        despite this prey having some desired effect in reducing 
                        overall production losses (Glahn unpubl. data). Even if 
                        preferred buffer prey could be identified, use of buffer 
                        prey to reduce damage on catfish remains controversial 
                        because of the possibility that more abundant prey will 
                        attract more cormorants to these ponds (Mott and Boyd 
                        1995). Along similar lines, some authors (Mott and Boyd 
                        1995, Erwin 1995) suggest the use of developing alternative 
                        foraging sites stocked with preferred buffer prey. However, 
                        even if such ponds could be developed, they would quickly 
                        be depleted by increasingly large cormorant populations 
                        exploiting these areas in southern aquaculture regions. 
                        Although pond dyes have never been evaluated, the natural 
                        turbidity (Secchi disk readings &lt;40 cm) of most catfish 
                        ponds would probably limit the utility of dyes for reducing 
                        the ability of cormorants to pursue and capture prey.

                      <p align="left">Exclusion, the physical separation of wildlife 
                        from the resource, usually entails erecting fences, nets, 
                        or other barriers. Although total separation might not 
                        be practical, various barrier techniques may serve to 
                        limit cormorant access to ponds or the fish in these ponds 
                        (Littauer et al. 1997). </p>
                      <p align="left"><strong><em>Complete enclosure</em></strong> 
                        - Supported netting is the only completely effective method 
                        of excluding cormorants from ponds but is physically and 
                        economically impractical for large (&gt;5 ha) catfish 
                        and bait fish ponds. Littauer et al. (1997) estimated 
                        that it would cost approximately $1 million to enclose 
                        a 40-ha farm. Furthermore, the levees on most catfish 
                        farms are not wide enough to accommodate support systems 
                        and vehicle access. Complete exclusion might be cost-effective 
                        and prudent for high-value fish like trout or ornamental 
                        fish in smaller ponds and raceways; however, complete 
                        exclusion of extensive (&gt;50,000 ha) aquaculture production 
                        areas is impractical and may negatively impact other waterbirds 
                        that currently use these wetlands. </p>
                      <p align="left"><strong><em>Partial enclosure</em></strong> 
                        - Plastic or wire grids suspended over ponds can deter 
                        cormorant flocks from landing or taking off but do not 
                        exclude cormorants from highly attractive aquaculture 
                        ponds (Barlow and Bock 1984, Moerbeek et al. 1987). Although 
                        some research continues with the use of overhead wires 
                        in Arkansas, May and Bodenchuk (1992) concluded that an 
                        overhead wire grid structure over a 3.7-ha pond was impractical 
                        under current catfish culture practices. Materials ($404 
                        per ha; $163/ac) and labor (15.5 person-days) costs were 
                        lower than full net-coverage, but the structural durability 
                        and functional design were not adequate for protecting 
                        large ponds. As with complete enclosure, benefit to cost 
                        ratio for using many partial enclosures may not justify 
                        their use. However, Keller (1999a) found that overhead 
                        wires, in conjunction with harassment efforts, might be 
                        cost-effective for protecting smaller (0.2 to 2.5 ha) 
                        ponds from great cormorants in Germany where the state 
                        of Bavaria subsidized 40 percent of the costs. Overhead 
                        wires can exclude and injure other nontarget waterbirds 
                        (Mott and Boyd 1995), but marking wires with flagging 
                        material can minimize this risk. </p>
                      <p align="left"><strong><em>Floating and underwater grids</em></strong> 
                        - Floating ropes can hamper cormorants from landing and 
                        taking off from ponds, depending on the prevailing wind 
                        direction. Mott et al. (1995) partially protected 2 catfish 
                        ponds from cormorant flocks (total of 10.6 ha; 26.17 ac) 
                        for 3 and 8 weeks, respectively. The ropes cost $97/ha 
                        ($39/ac) and took 57 hours to install and subsequently 
                        disassemble on the 2 ponds. Although floating ropes have 
                        practical advantages over overhead wires, they are similarly 
                        limited in effectiveness and would be less likely to deter 
                        cormorants in situations where few alternatives existed. 
                        Underwater barriers or baffle systems could theoretically 
                        interfere with cormorants' pursuit of fish (Barlow and 
                        Bock 1984), but studies using submerged nets as fish refugia 
                        to deter cormorant predation suggested no significant 
                        effects on predation rates (Gottfried 1998). Because of 
                        repeated harvesting with the multi-batch cropping system, 
                        most underwater barriers would have to be repeatedly removed 
                        and reinstalled, adding to overall costs of such systems.

                      <p align="left"><strong><em>At Aquaculture Facilities</em></strong> 
                        - Scare devices consist of auditory or visual stimuli 
                        intended to move or deter cormorants from a target site 
                        (Booth 1994, Draulans 1987, Littauer 1990a, Littauer 1990b, 
                        Mott and Boyd 1995). This category of harassment includes 
                        human activities, vehicles (truck, all-terrain vehicle, 
                        boat), propane exploders, pyrotechnics (exploding or whistling 
                        projectiles), cormorant distress calls, alarm units, sirens, 
                        and effigies (stationary or inflatable). Single devices 
                        or a combination of methods has thus far proven to alleviate 
                        depredation only temporarily (Draulans 1987, Moerbeek 
                        et al. 1987, Mott and Boyd 1995, Rodgers 1994). The typical 
                        practice is to patrol pond levees in a vehicle throughout 
                        daylight hours and shoot pyrotechnics or shotguns at birds. 
                        Human effigies have been used to augment this strategy 
                        (Stickley unpub. data). Altogether, 245 fish producers 
                        surveyed in the delta region of Mississippi by Stickley 
                        and Andrews (1989) claimed annual expenditures of $2.1 
                        million to harass all species of fish-eating birds. The 
                        cost-effectiveness of these efforts has not been determined. 
                        The expansive size of most catfish farms limits the effectiveness 
                        of harassment techniques (Reinhold and Sloan 1999). Because 
                        simultaneous harassment of all ponds is difficult on large 
                        farms, birds simply move to other ponds, resulting in 
                        no net decrease in predation. Even when birds can be dispersed 
                        from farms, they often return as soon as harassment ceases 
                        or simply move to other farms (Reinhold and Sloan 1999).

                        - Coordinated and simultaneous harassment of cormorants 
                        can disperse them from night roosts and reduce damage 
                        at nearby catfish farms (Mott et al. 1992, Hess 1994). 
                        Electronic noise generators, amplified recordings of cormorant 
                        alarm calls, propane gas exploders, pyrotechnics, and 
                        firecrackers can be used. During a 3-year study, Mott 
                        et al. (1998) evaluated a coordinated roost dispersal 
                        program of cormorants at all known roost sites in the 
                        delta region of Mississippi and observed fewer cormorants 
                        at catfish ponds near harassed roosts. Harassed cormorants 
                        temporarily shifted their roosting activity from the intensively 
                        farmed east-central delta to sites along the Mississippi 
                        River, where they foraged primarily on shad. </p>
                      <p align="left">Despite the partial success of this program, 
                        several factors limit its usefulness as a long-term solution 
                        to aquaculture predation problems. Roost harassment must 
                        be conducted on a regular basis to have a sustained effect 
                        (Mott et al. 1998) because harassed cormorants usually 
                        establish new roosts at the nearest suitable location, 
                        then return to previous roosting sites when harassment 
                        ceases. In 1993, when the roost dispersal program was 
                        initiated in the delta region of Mississippi, there were 
                        48 known cormorant roosts in this region. That number 
                        increased to 75 by 1999 (Glahn et al. 2000). If this number 
                        continues to increase, there eventually may not be enough 
                        producers to simultaneously harass cormorants at occupied 
                        roosts in the delta region of Mississippi. </p>
                      <p align="left">Another problem encountered with the roost 
                        dispersal program is that hunters increasingly express 
                        concerns about unintended effects of harassment on waterfowl 
                        (Mott et al. 1998). Although the use of low-power laser 
                        devices for dispersing cormorants may help alleviate these 
                        concerns (Glahn et al. unpub. data), an increasing number 
                        of hunting clubs and refuges are restricting cormorant 
                        harassment. Cormorant populations have increased at these 
                        sites to 15,000 birds (D. Reinhold, USDA-WS, pers. commun.), 
                        negating efforts to move cormorants out of the protected 
                        area. Repeated harassment with non-lethal frightening 
                        devices may become less effective as birds become accustomed 
                        to them. A recent study (Glahn in press) indicates that 
                        shooting cormorants in roosts is as effective as dispersing 
                        them with pyrotechnics and may not result in habituation. 
                        However, lethal control at roosts is not authorized under 
                        current regulations. </p>

                      <p align="left">Shooting a limited number of cormorants 
                        reinforces non-lethal harassment (EIFAC 1988, Hess 1994, 
                        Littauer 1990b, Mastrangelo et al. 1995, Rodgers 1988 
                        and 1994, Tucker and Robinson 1990, USDA [Vol.2, J-12; 
                        Vol. 3, P-32] 1994). This strategy can be part of an integrated 
                        damage management plan implemented at farms when non-lethal 
                        methods are ineffective (Mastrangelo et al. 1995). The 
                        USDI-FWS depredation order for the double-crested cormorant 
                        (50 CFR Part 21) allows for localized control of cormorant 
                        populations at aquaculture facilities (USDI-FWS 1998). 
                        However, most fish farmers can shoot only a small percentage 
                        of the cormorants feeding in their ponds (Hess 1994). 
                        Similarly, if shooting in roosts were restricted to daylight 
                        hours, only a small percentage of roosting birds would 
                        be killed (Glahn in press). Hess (1994) investigated the 
                        feasibility and potential impact of allowing farmers to 
                        shoot an unlimited number of cormorants on their farms. 
                        The producers at two facilities (1,920 ha) in the delta 
                        region of Mississippi spent more than 3,000 person-hours 
                        trying to shoot cormorants, yet killed only 290 birds, 
                        as the birds quickly learned to avoid the hunters. Glahn 
                        (in press) observed the same response when attempting 
                        to shoot cormorants in roosts, resulting in less than 
                        5 percent of the roosting population killed before the 
                        roost dispersed. Waterfowl exhibit similar behavior during 
                        the hunting season (Owens 1977). The cormorant depredation 
                        order allows fish farmers to implement strategies similar 
                        to those used by waterfowl hunters, such as using decoys, 
                        blinds, and camouflage clothing (USDI-FWS 1998). Employing 
                        such tactics might enable farmers to reduce the number 
                        of birds on their farms significantly without affecting 
                        continental or flyway populations. Under the old permit 
                        system, catfish farmers reported taking an average of 
                        only 42 cormorants per year, and the total number reported 
                        shot in any one year never exceeded 68 percent of the 
                        authorized take (Mastrangelo et al. 1995). Assuming an 
                        average take of 42 cormorants per catfish farm, the USDI-FWS 
                        predicted a total annual take of 92,400 cormorants under 
                        the depredation order (USDI-FWS 1998). However, Glahn 
                        et al. (2000) found that the take under the depredation 
                        order might exceed the reported take under the former 
                        depredation permit system and recommended more extensive 
                        monitoring of the number of cormorants taken under the 
                        depredation order. However, even doubling the take would 
                        represent only a small percentage of the annual recruitment, 
                        conservatively estimated at 612,000 cormorants per year 
                        (USDI-FWS 1998). </p>

                      <p align="left">Localized management efforts help to reduce 
                        cormorant depredations on southern aquaculture farms but 
                        have little effect on the flyway population (Belant et 
                        al. In press, Glahn et al. 2000, Mott et al. 1998). The 
                        objective of flyway management would be to help alleviate 
                        localized conflicts by managing the &quot;interior&quot; 
                        population of cormorants. Van Eerden et al. (1995) noted 
                        that local conflicts between human interests and great 
                        cormorants (P. carbo) in Europe seemed impossible to mitigate 
                        without managing the entire continental population. For 
                        instance, large-scale sanctioned shooting of great cormorants 
                        in Germany resulted in no reduction of the observed wintering 
                        population (Keller 1999b). This seems to parallel the 
                        lack of population decline of birds wintering in the delta 
                        region of Mississippi despite the large take of cormorants 
                        under the depredation order (Glahn et al. 2000). To some 
                        degree, the same difficulty has been observed in attempting 
                        to control breeding populations with egg oiling (Gross 
                        1952, McLeod and Bondar 1953). However, combining egg 
                        oiling and culling has been effective in controlling populations 
                        on a localized basis (Bedard et al. 1999). Thus, effective 
                        manage ment of cormorants for reducing depredation to 
                        southern aquaculture will likely require more intensive 
                        control (culling) on the wintering grounds, control on 
                        the breeding grounds, or a combination of both. In addition, 
                        preventing new breeding colonies from being established 
                        might be an effective way of controlling populations (Bregenballe 
                        et al. (1997). A recently initiated satellite telemetry 
                        study (QA- 742) will provide insight on where control 
                        may be best implemented but not the extent of control 
                        needed. For instance, if cormorants wintering in southern 
                        aquaculture regions have a strong fidelity for these foraging 
                        areas but come from a wide breeding area, then control 
                        might be best implemented on the wintering area, i.e. 
                        culling at winter roosts. Conversely, control on the breeding 
                        grounds may be important if most cormorants come from 
                        a rather narrow breeding range. However, science-based 
                        management of cormorants will require a thorough knowledge 
                        of population and density-dependant parameters that can 
                        be incorporated into a population dynamics model for determining 
                        the type and extent of control needed to reduce cormorant 
                        conflicts. </p>
                      <p align="left">Most wildlife management plans include species-specific 
                        population goals, plans for meeting those goals (e.g., 
                        hunting regulations, habitat management plans), guidelines 
                        for gathering information on important variables (e.g., 
                        population changes, natality, and mortality rates), and 
                        criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the plan 
                        (Williams and Nichols 1990, Nichols et al. 1995). As with 
                        waterfowl and other species, management of cormorants 
                        should be based on the ecology of the species on both 
                        the breeding and wintering grounds as well as on biologically 
                        realistic and socially acceptable population goals. </p>
                      <p align="left">Cormorant Life History - Double-crested 
                        cormorants are considered seabirds but are well adapted 
                        to life away from maritime regions. Like other Pelecaniformes, 
                        cormorants are relatively long-lived (Johnsgard 1993), 
                        an important consideration when deciding how to manage 
                        this species. Populations of long-lived species tend to 
                        be regulated by the mortality of juveniles, rather than 
                        by that of adults (Hickey 1952, Johnsgard 1993). Because 
                        cormorants are long-lived and mortality is highest among 
                        juveniles, management relying on egg-oiling and other 
                        reproductive control measures will likely be less effective 
                        and take longer to achieve the desired result (see also 
                        B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, 1999; Dolbeer 1998). Unlike 
                        most seabirds, cormorants have a relatively high annual 
                        reproductive rate of two to three fledglings per year 
                        (Price and Weseloh 1986, Weseloh and Ewins 1994, Weseloh 
                        et al. 1995). Birds usually reach sexual maturity and 
                        breed 3 years after hatching, although some breed during 
                        their second year (Palmer 1962, Weseloh and Ewins 1994, 
                        Weseloh et al. 1995). In addition, cormorants have several 
                        adaptations that help them avoid density-dependent mortality 
                        and maintain their population at or near the environmental 
                        carrying capacity (Johnsgard 1993). Based on great cormorant 
                        population modeling, these density dependant factors would 
                        tend to buffer the impact of management actions, but most 
                        management actions alone or in combination would lead 
                        to stabilization below the environmental carrying capacity 
                        (Bregnballe et al. 1997). In contrast to information available 
                        to generate population models for the great cormorant 
                        in Europe, very little information is available concerning 
                        the demographics of the double-crested cormorant (Erwin 
                        1995, B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, 1999). </p>
                      <p align="left">Setting Population Goals - Wildlife managers 
                        must have a clearly defined population goal and guidelines 
                        by which to meet that goal based on their understanding 
                        of the population status and dynamics of a species (even 
                        if limited) in order to justify and defend lethal or reproductive 
                        control measures (Dolbeer 1998). Precedence for such action 
                        is seen in the sustained increases in populations of herring 
                        (<em>Larus argentatus</em>) and lesser black-backed gulls 
                        (<em>L. fuscus</em>) which prompted wildlife managers 
                        in Britain to cull populations to reduce habitat damage 
                        and impacts on other colonial waterbirds (Duncan 1978, 
                        Wanless and Langslow 1983, Wanless et al. 1996). Also, 
                        biologists successfully implemented a 5-year plan in 1989 
                        to reduce numbers in a breeding colony of cormorants whose 
                        excreta was destroying unique insular habitats in the 
                        St. Lawrence Estuary (B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, 1999). 
                        In both Britain and the St. Lawrence Estuary, decisions 
                        to remove birds and the population goals established were 
                        assessed relative to reducing species-specific damage, 
                        while maintaining biodiversity within the ecosystem. </p>
                      <p align="left">Despite the marked increase in cormorant 
                        numbers in the United States and Canada since 1970 and 
                        a population now estimated at more than 1 million birds 
                        (Tyson et al. 1999), natural limits on further increase 
                        and peak population size cannot be accurately predicted. 
                        Nonetheless, such population increases on the breeding 
                        grounds will likely result in increased depredations at 
                        aquaculture facilities and other conflicts in the Southern 
                        United States, given recent band recovery analysis and 
                        satellite telemetry linking cormorants wintering in Louisiana, 
                        Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas with breeding populations 
                        in the Great Lakes. Although there are increasing concerns 
                        about the unchecked growth of cormorant populations, there 
                        is no consensus on the biological and social carrying 
                        capacities for cormorants on either the breeding or the 
                        wintering grounds. Although population goals in southern 
                        aquaculture regions are difficult to ascertain, studies 
                        that determine the economic threshold of cormorant predation 
                        may be an important step in helping define socially acceptable 
                        goals. In addition, projections of the extent of control 
                        needed from population modeling, coupled with a knowledge 
                        of the logistics for accomplishing these control efforts, 
                        may provide insight into setting biologically realistic 
                        population goals. </p>
                      <p align="left">Evaluating Management Options - Public sentiment 
                        has and will continue to spark debate about the lethal 
                        management of wildlife populations. Increasing public 
                        awareness and input on natural resource management issues 
                        demands that wildlife managers investigate thoroughly 
                        all options and stand ready to communicate and defend 
                        their decisions. The path of least resistance may be to 
                        base strategies on natural population regulatory mechanisms 
                        (e.g., limitations on breeding space, fluctuations in 
                        the prey base, or disease). However, such expediency will 
                        likely maintain the status quo and may even lead to increased 
                        in conflicts between cormorant and human activities for 
                        an extended period of time. For example, Bregnballe et 
                        al. (1997) predicted from population modeling that rapidly 
                        increasing great cormorant populations in 1995 would further 
                        increase from 108,700 birds to approximately 600,000 before 
                        stabilizing 14 years later and that most of this growth 
                        would occur during the last 5 years before stabilization. 
                        A variety of management scenarios can be evaluated and 
                        management decisions justified (given current knowledge 
                        of the species' population dynamics) by using population 
                        models that project the effects of various options relative 
                        to a range of realistic population variables (Bregnballe 
                        et al. 1997, see Crouse et al. 1987, Williams and Nichols 
                        1990, B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, Nichols et al. 1995, 
                        Wanless et al. 1996, Schmutz et al. 1997). For example, 
                        Bregnballe et al. (1997) used modeling to explore the 
                        efficiency of various control options for great cormorant 
                        populations and found that all strategies alone or in 
                        combination lead to stabilization of the population at 
                        lower levels. However, culling adults and preventing formation 
                        of new colonies were the most efficient means of stabilizing 
                        the population. With better demographic information, population 
                        modeling will help guide the planning process with double-crested 
                        cormorants. </p>
                      <p align="left">Models that have already been used successfully 
                        to plan the culling of cormorant colonies in the St. Lawrence 
                        Estuary (B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, 1999), to evaluate 
                        the growth rate of the cormorant population on Lake Ontario 
                        (Price and Weseloh 1986), and to evaluate the effectiveness 
                        of lethal versus reproductive control measures (Dolbeer 
                        1998) provide a basis for developing future plans to manage 
                        cormorant populations. Even with the limited demographic 
                        data available for cormorants, initial age-classified 
                        matrix models (Caswell 1989, McDonald and Caswell 1993) 
                        can be developed that will aid assessment of cormorant 
                        population growth thus far, and guide future management 
                        decisions. </p>
                      <p align="left">Assessing Results - Population models are 
                        most useful for developing testable hypotheses; confirmation 
                        of model predictions must still be obtained from the field. 
                        Censuses of managed populations should be conducted during 
                        and after control programs are implemented to judge effectiveness 
                        and prevent excessive losses (Duncan 1978, Wanless and 
                        Langslow 1983, B&eacute;dard et al. 1995, 1999, Wanless 
                        et al. 1996). Estimates of population indices following 
                        a management program provide the data necessary to refine 
                        management models important in predicting future population 
                        trends (see Wanless et al. 1996). For example, further 
                        monitoring of population trends and annual take under 
                        the depredation order could provide insight into culling 
                        adults as a regional management technique that might, 
                        if expanded, accommodate flyway-based objectives. Ultimately, 
                        the results of management programs should be assessed 
                        from the standpoint of resource economics (Werner in press) 
                        and reducing the costs or enhancing the effectiveness 
                        of other control strategies (Mott et al. 1998).</p>

                      </p>
                      <p align="left">Southern aquaculture, primarily devoted 
                        to the cultivation of catfish, crawfish, and bait fish, 
                        involves the extensive use of large shallow ponds that 
                        are highly susceptible to predation by cormorants. Previous 
                        research has clearly documented the resulting impact on 
                        the catfish industry. This problem has been exacerbated 
                        in recent years by the doubling of wintering cormorant 
                        populations in catfish production areas of Mississippi 
                        from 1995 to 1999. Future increases in cormorant wintering 
                        populations combined with growth of southern breeding 
                        populations will likely intensify the problem. Current 
                        damage abatement measures are of limited effectiveness 
                        and are becoming increasingly difficult to implement. 
                        Continued research is needed to evaluate cultural and 
                        barrier strategies to reduce depredations at aquaculture 
                        farms. Methods should also be explored for improving the 
                        implementation of the current standing depredation order 
                        for reducing local populations on aquaculture farms as 
                        well as expanding the depredation order for reinforcing 
                        harassment strategies at roosts. Authority should be sought 
                        to implement control of localized populations at southern 
                        breeding colonies, as needed, to forestall future depredation 
                        problems and population growth. </p>
                      <p align="left">Further, managers should continue to explore 
                        the factors ultimately affecting the growth of the cormorant 
                        population within the Mississippi flyway and management 
                        options necessary to meet preset population goals. We 
                        suggest that these investigations include the development 
                        of a goal-oriented population model to guide management 
                        decisions. Given suitable population models to guide its 
                        implementation, we suggest that cormorant populations 
                        be managed on a flyway basis, as part of an integrated 
                        strategy to reduce their conflicts to southern aquaculture, 
                        as well as elsewhere. </p>
                      <p align="left">Without human intervention, cormorant populations 
                        are likely to continue to grow and create increasing problems 
                        with southern aquaculture facilities, fisheries, and other 
                        colonial nesting species. Dialogue among public agencies 
                        and private organizations concerned about the conservation 
                        and management of cormorants would facilitate the development 
                        of realistic population goals that would ensure the continued 
                        well being of this species while mitigating the negative 
                        impacts associated with unbridled population growth.</p></td>
