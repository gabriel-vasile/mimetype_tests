Abstract

The Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) and Great Egret (Ardea alba) nested in
eight colonies along the Upper Mississippi River, USA, and individual birds
were followed by airplane to feeding sites during the nesting seasons in
1995-1998. Both species used braided channel/backwater habitats for feeding
more than expected, based on availability, and open pool and main navigation
channel less than expected. Most individuals of both species fed <5 km from
their breeding colony and avoided sites >10 km away. Habitat and distance
need to be considered simultaneously when assessing habitat quality for herons
and egrets. The Great Blue Heron flew farther to feeding sites during the
care-of-young period than during incubation and the Great Egret showed the
opposite pattern. The Great Blue Heron tended to feed solitarily; only 10% of
the feeding flights ended at a location where another heron was already present.
About one-third of Great Egret feeding flights ended at a location with another
egret already present. Colony placement on the landscape seemed to be a
function of the feeding radius of each colony.
