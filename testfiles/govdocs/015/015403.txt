  Description:
    Abstract:
      The conceptual model for this study is based on the idea that
      hydroperiod is a long-term process that primarily influences the
      abundance, body size, and species composition of the prey community
      whereas water depth has immediate effects on individual birds by
      influencing their ability to capture prey. This study seeks to
      determine through field experiments, the proximate effects of water
      depth, prey density, prey size, and prey species on wading bird
      foraging parameters.  The species of wading birds examined in this
      study are those in the ATLSS wading bird model: the Wood Stork, White
      Ibis, Great Egret, and Great Blue Heron.
    Purpose:
      The recovery of wading bird populations has been identified as a key
      component of successful Everglades restoration.  Proposed causes for
      the decline in wading bird numbers have in common the notion that
      current hydropatterns have altered the availability of prey.  Indeed,
      food availability may be the single most important factor limiting
      populations of wading birds in the Everglades.

      In the face of conflicting management scenarios, knowing the relative
      importance of each component of food availability is a precursor to
      understanding the effects of specific water management regimes on
      wading birds.  Ongoing modeling efforts in south Florida such as the
      ATLSS program, integrate such information and provide predictive power
      for future management decisions.  Currently, the biggest information
      gap limiting the wading bird model of ATLSS is foraging success as a
      function of prey availability.  The South Florida Water Management
      District (SFWMD) is currently conducting a series of experiments aimed
      at determining the effects of water management on the use of foraging
      sites by wading birds.  Site-use data are available immediately after
      each experiment and thus allow for quick analyses and write-up. 
      However, also as part of those experiments, we recorded on film,
      foraging behavior of wading birds at feeding sites with known prey
      availabilities.

      Process_Description:
        Field experiments were conducted in a set of 15 0.2-ha ponds
        directly adjacent to, and NW of, Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee
        National Wildlife Refuge in Palm Beach County, Florida. Three
        experiments (water depth and fish density, water depth and fish
        size, water depth and fish species) were conducted between March,
        1996 and March 1997 (contact Gawlik for detailed methods for the
        water depth and fish density experiment).  Each experiment began
        when ponds were stocked with fish and ended when bird-use nearly
        ceased (a period of approximately 2 weeks).  The maximum number of
        birds present in a day (all ponds pooled) was approximately 280. 
        For the fish density experiment, 2 treatments were assigned randomly
        among 12 ponds using a 3x2x2 factorial arrangement (water depth: 10
        cm, 19 cm, 28 cm; fish density: 3 fish/m2, 10 fish/m2; replicates:
        2). For the fish size experiment, 2 treatments were assigned
        randomly among 12 ponds using a 3x2x2 factorial arrangement (water
        depth: 19 cm, 28 cm, 37 cm; fish size: 3 cm, 8 cm; replicates: 2).
        All ponds were stocked at a density of 8 fish/m2.  For the fish
        species experiment, 3 treatments (water depth: 10 cm, 28 cm; fish
        density: 4 fish/m2, 16 fish/m2; fish species: bluegill, golden
        shiner; replicates: 2) were assigned randomly among 12 ponds.  This
        2x2x2x2 arrangement was more complex because the treatment of high
        fish density and low water was eliminated from the design.

        For all experiments, ponds were initially stocked at known fish
        densities; however, those densities decreased quickly as a result of
        bird predation.  Thus, we treated fish density as a continuous
        variable, which we monitored regularly.   We determined fish
        densities during at least 4 sampling periods based on 1-m2
        throw-trap samples (Kushlan 1974).  Sampling ceased in individual
        ponds if no stocked fish were captured in any of the throw-trap
        samples.  Throw-trap samples were distributed evenly within a pond
        by dividing each pond into 16 10x8 m plots and conducting one
        throw-trap sample in each plot during each sampling period. A test
        of sampling efficiency indicated the numbers of fish captured in
        throw traps represents an average of 55% of the actual fish density
        in the experimental ponds.  All fish density values reported are the
        number of fish captured in throw traps uncorrected for sampling
        efficiency.  A linear regression model was fitted to the data from
        each pond such that the response was the number of fish/m2
        transformed as y(ln +1).  The predicted values were back-transformed
        to get estimated densities of fish for each pond each day of the
        experiment with the constraint that no predicted value could be less
        than zero.  The estimated values were used in subsequent analyses of
        bird foraging success.

        To measure wading bird foraging responses, we filmed feeding
        flocksfor 5-45 minutes from a vehicle with a Hi-8 mm video camera
        and 8-120 mm zoom lens.  A pilot study indicated that filming from a
        parked vehicle with cloth-covered windows disturbed birds less than
        a portable blind.  Selection of a flock to film was based on where
        the largest group of birds were foraging and whether data were
        lacking for a given treatment combination.  Flocks were allowed
        several minutes to re-settle and resume feeding before filming was
        initiated.  Filming was concluded if flock size changed by more than
        25%.  Our aim was to get 15 min of film on each bird (with a minimum
        time limit of 5 min) and a maximum of 15 birds per species per film
        session.  If too few individuals in a film session met that
        criterion then the minimum time limit was reduced to 2 min.  During
        feeding activities, birds would sometimes travel to the edge of a
        pond or leave the pond momentarily.  Because of the sloped edge of
        the pond, water depths in those areas were less than treatment
        levels.  Thus, we excluded from time-activity budgets any period
        where a bird was at the edge or outside of a pond.  This criterion
        resulted in a further shortening of some time-activity budgets.
      Process_Date: 200001
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Following the field portion of the study, time-activity budgets of
        focal birds (Altmann 1974) were constructed from videotapes.  Tapes
        were viewed using a Hi-8 VCR connected to a high-resolution video
        monitor.  Data were entered into an Oracle database through a
        personal computer connected to an interoffice-network.

        To eliminate the possibility of constructing time-activity budgets
        on the same individual more than once in a session, we did not use
        as focal birds, individuals of the focal species that appeared in
        view after the first focal bird left the screen.  However, before a
        focal bird left the field of view, any new birds that appeared could
        have been used as focal birds.  A foraging bout ended when a focal
        bird left the field of view, became obscured in a flock, or the film
        session ended (usually about 15 minutes). Capture rates were
        calculated as the number of prey consumed divided by the length of
        time (min) of the time-activity budget.   Birds that never consumed
        a prey item were excluded from the analysis.

        From each time-activity budget, we calculated mean prey-intake rate
        as the response variable.  Descriptive statistics such as the mean
        and standard deviation are presented for each bird species at
        different treatment levels.  This is the format most useful for
        incorporating parameter values into the ATLSS wading bird model (W.
        Wolff, Univ. of Miami, pers. commun.).  For species of which we had
        adequate data to conduct statistical analyses, we determined the
        relative effects of the treatment variables on the response
        variables. Tests were conducted using PROC GLM in SAS version 6.12
        for Windowsâ with water depth, fish size, and fish species as class
        variables and fish density as a continuous variable.  We specified
        an initial full model containing main effects and interactions. 
        Non-significant (p > 0.05) interactions indicated that a model was
        over-specified and contained more terms than necessary (Littel et
        al. 1991, Freund and Wilson 1993).  In that case, we constructed a
        subsequent set of reduced models containing the main effects and
        significant interactions only.

      Process_Description:
        Thus far, only the water depth and fish density experiment has been
        completely analyzed.  The results from the water depth and fish size
         experiment are nearing completion.  Key results include the
        development and refinement of a conceptual model of wading bird
        foraging behavior.  This model provided the rules for quantifying
        time-activity budgets for all species, including tactile and visual
        foragers, under the circumstance encountered during the experiments.
         We calculated prey-intake rates and their associated variability
        for 2 prey densities and 3 water depths.  These numbers can be used
        to refine parameter estimates currently in the ATLSS wading bird
        model.  We reported foraging costs (giving-up densities of fish) and
        their associated variability for each species at 3 depths.  Note
        that fish density estimates and giving-up densities were not
        corrected for sampling efficiency thus resulting in an underestimate
        of true density.  The adjusted numbers can be used in the ATLSS
        model because it reflects the lower threshold of fish abundance
        where wading birds will no longer use the site.

      Process_Description:
        As part of the third experiment, the District (SFWMD) filmed
        foraging behaviors of wading birds at feeding sites with known fish
        species, water depths, and fish densities.  Current funding levels
        at the District dictate that the foraging data, which require
        thousands of hours to extract from the films, will not be available
        soon enough to be used in the ATLSS wading bird model.  This third
        experiment proposes to examine the effect of fish species, fish
        density, and water depth.  The species of wading birds examined in
        this study are those in the ATLSS wading bird model: Wood Stork
        (Mycteria americana), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), Great Egret
        (Casmerodius albus) and Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias). The
        species of fish being compared are the Bluegill and Golden Shiner,
        both of which are native to the Everglades.  The experimental
        hypotheses being tested are that fish species, fish density, and
        water depth, affect wading bird prey-intake rates and capture
        success.
