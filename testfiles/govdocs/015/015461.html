They<br><br>          posited  that  the provision  self-destructed  on  three separate<br><br>          bases,  viz., (1) the first amendment bars any attempt to mandate                  ____<br><br>          first  dollar disclosure  of political  contributors' identities;<br><br>          (2) Rhode Island's  first dollar disclosure  law, when placed  in<br><br>          its  statutory  context,  places   an  impermissible  burden   on<br><br>          associational rights;  and (3) the proviso  denies the plaintiffs<br><br>          equal  protection.

A disclosure statute may survive such scrutiny only<br><br>          if it satisfies a two-part test:  (1) the statute as a whole must<br><br>          serve a  compelling governmental interest, and  (2) a substantial<br><br>          nexus must exist  between the served interest and the information<br><br>          to  be revealed.

Thus,  forced disclosure may  be warranted<br><br>          when the spotlighted information enhances voters' knowledge about<br><br>          a candidate's possible allegiances and interests, inhibits actual<br><br>          and apparent corruption by exposing large contributions to public<br><br>          view, or  aids state officials in  enforcing contribution limits.<br><br>          See Brown, 459  U.S. at 92; Buckley, 424 U.S.  at 66-68.

As<br><br>          the  disclosure threshold drops toward zero, the bond between the<br><br><br>                                          11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          information  revealed and  the  governmental  interests  involved<br><br>          becomes weaker and, therefore, more tenuous.

Common sense suggests that information about<br><br>          the  source of  a $1  contribution does  not advance  the state's<br><br>          interest in deterring actual  or apparent corruption because such<br><br>          a donation has a limited (perhaps nonexistent) potential to exact<br><br>          an  illegal  or  unethical   quid  pro  quo.

We  find<br><br>          plaintiffs' analysis to be convincing.<br><br>                    The  first  amendment  frowns  upon laws  which  burden<br><br>          associational rights,  particularly  in the  sphere of  political<br><br>          speech.

First, any law that burdens the rights of<br><br>          individuals to  come together  for political purposes  is suspect<br><br>          and  must  be  viewed   warily.    Second,  burdens   which  fall<br><br>          exclusively on those who  choose to exercise their right  to band<br><br>          together, leaving  individual speakers unbowed,  merit heightened<br><br>          scrutiny.   Third,  measures which hinder  group efforts  to make<br><br>          independent expenditures  in  support  of  candidates  or  ballot<br><br>          initiatives are particularly vulnerable to constitutional attack.<br><br>          The  first two  precepts derive  in part  from the  importance of<br><br>          group  expression as a method  of amplifying the  voices of those<br><br>          with meager  means.

We  disagree.  While legislative judgments  must be<br><br>          given a wide  berth, judicial deference should  never be confused<br><br>          with outright capitulation.

And,<br><br>          in  any  event, judicial  deference  to legislative  line-drawing<br><br>          diminishes when  the lines are disconnected,  crooked, or uneven.<br><br>          So it  is here:   the  Rhode Island General  Assembly has  made a<br><br>          series  of conflicting  judgments  about  appropriate  disclosure<br><br>          thresholds without offering any legally  satisfactory explanation<br><br>          for its pererrations.<br><br>                    This  zigging  and  zagging  is  of  especial   concern<br><br>          because,   when  citizens  engage  in  first  amendment  activity<br><br>          affecting  elections,  the  state's  interest  in  disclosure  is<br><br>          generally  a constant, that is, the state's interest "is the same<br><br>          whether  or  not  [the  individual  actors]  are  members  of  an<br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               9Under Rhode Island  law, PACs  may form  for the  exclusive<br>          purpose of promoting or opposing ballot questions.

Rhode Island, in  one fell swoop, not only departed<br><br>          from the usual rule of constancy but also imported a particularly<br><br>          virulent strain of  unevenness into its  statutory scheme:   most<br><br>          PACs must disclose the  identity of every contributor, regardless<br><br>          of  amount,   while  individual  candidates   need  disclose  the<br><br>          identities only of contributors who donate upwards of $100.<br><br>                    This  imbalance   does  not  cater  to  any  cognizable<br><br>          government interest.  It  does not serve the state's  interest in<br><br>          combatting  corruption because  corruption can  as easily  spring<br><br>          from  direct  contributions to  candidates as  from contributions<br><br>          that  flow  through  PACs.     And,  if  the  danger   that  tiny<br><br>          contributions  will  foment corruption  is  not  great enough  to<br><br>          justify significant inroads on  first amendment rights, see supra                                                                  ___ _____<br><br>          Part II(A), it is certainly not great enough to justify disparate<br><br>          treatment  of PACs.  Similarly, the unevenness does not serve the<br><br>          state's interest in enforcing its contribution limits; after all,<br><br>          the district  court found no evidence that PAC contributors might<br><br>          try  to  subvert  the  $1,000 cap  by  an  endless  stream  of $1<br><br>          donations.

To  be  sure,  when<br><br>          contributors'  identities are  made  public, the  name of  a PAC,<br><br>          standing alone, could  in some  states have little  meaning to  a<br><br>          large segment of the electorate.

Gen. Laws    17-25-15(c)(1) has at  least<br><br>          three grave weaknesses.  First, by mandating public revelation of<br><br>          all  PAC contributors,  it burdens  the rights of  individuals to<br><br>          band  together  for  the  purpose of  making  either  independent<br><br>          election expenditures or direct political contributions.  Second,<br><br>          by  imposing  this burden  on  PACs  and PAC  contributors  while<br><br>          regulating  candidates  and certain  of  their  financial backers<br><br>          (viz.,  individuals who contribute  directly to candidates rather           ____<br><br>          than to PACs) more loosely, the statute compounds  the unfairness<br><br>          of the burden.  Finally, the disparity between the two disclosure<br><br>          thresholds  (one for PACs  and the  other for  individuals), and,<br><br>          hence,  the net  burden imposed  solely on  associational rights,<br><br>          bears no substantial relation to the  attainment of any important<br><br>          state interest.   Their cumulative effect  compels the conclusion<br><br>          that the statute abridges the first amendment.10<br><br>                    We  have  one more  stop  to make  before  leaving this<br><br>          subject.    The amici  invite us  to  limit any  determination of<br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               10In  light of  this determination,  we need  not  address a<br>          further statutory anomaly:   that,  while most PACs  are held  to<br>          first dollar disclosure under Rhode Island law, a select group of<br>          PACs  enjoys preferential treatment.  See R.I. Gen. Laws   17-25-                                                ___<br>          15(c)(1)  (exempting PACs  sponsored  by labor  unions and  those<br>          which are funded through payroll checkoff plans from first dollar<br>          disclosure requirements).    Similarly, because  we  decide  that<br>          Rhode  Island's first  dollar disclosure  provision impermissibly<br>          burdens the right  to association, we need not  determine whether<br>          it also violates the equal protection clause.<br><br>                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          unconstitutionality  to the  two  plaintiff PACs.   However,  the<br><br>          cases relied on  by the  amici, see, e.g.,  FEC v.

Laws   17-25-15(c)(1)  and the case proceeded below  on this<br><br>          theory.  Moreover, the reason we  invalidate the statute concerns<br><br>          the disparate treatment of PACs qua PACs, and, thus, obtains with                                          ___<br><br>          equal vigor regardless  of which particular PAC  may be involved.<br><br>          This  is a  salient consideration in  determining what  remedy is<br><br>          appropriate, see, e.g., Sec'y  of State v.

Her major theme is<br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               13Under  Rhode   Island  law,  contributions   to  political<br>          campaigns are customarily capped  at $1,000 per donor.   See R.I.                                                                   ___<br>          Gen. Laws   17-25-10.1.

This disparity                                 ___ ___<br>          constitutes the contribution cap gap of which Leonard complains.<br><br>                                          26<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          that  regulatory   disparities  of   this  type   are  inherently<br><br>          impermissible.   Her minor theme is that  the cap gap burdens her<br><br>          first   amendment   rights   without  serving   a   corresponding<br><br>          governmental   interest.     We   consider   these  asseverations<br><br>          sequentially, affording plenary review.

The  most immediate  barrier  to  the  success of  this<br><br>          argument is that the Supreme  Court has upheld a very direct  and<br><br>          tangible incentive:   the provision of public funds to candidates<br><br>          who  agree  to  place  decreased  reliance  on  private  campaign<br><br>          contributions.

She is fishing in an empty pond.<br><br><br>                                          27<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          For  one thing,  the distinction that  Leonard struggles  to draw<br><br>          between denying the  carrot and  striking with the  stick is,  in<br><br>          many  contexts,  more  semantic  than  substantive.    This  case<br><br>          illustrates  the  point.   The  question  whether Rhode  Island's<br><br>          system  of public  financing imposes  a penalty  on non-complying<br><br>          candidates  or, instead, confers a benefit on those who do comply<br><br>          is a non-issue,  roughly comparable to  bickering over whether  a<br><br>          glass is  half full or half  empty.  After all,  there is nothing<br><br>          inherently penal about a $1,000 contribution cap.<br><br>                    For another thing, to the degree that the question does<br><br>          have  a concrete answer, the  answer appears contrary  to the one<br><br>          Leonard suggests.  Leonard has adduced no legislative  history or<br><br>          other  evidence suggestive  of punitive  purpose.   Moreover, the<br><br>          Rhode Island statute sets up a $1,000 cap as the norm and doubles<br><br>          the  cap only  if a  candidate meets  certain conditions.   Logic<br><br>          suggests that the higher  cap is, therefore, a premium  earned by<br><br>          meeting statutory eligibility requirements rather  than a penalty<br><br>          imposed  on those  who  either cannot  or  will not  satisfy  the<br><br>          requirements.  <br><br>                    Third, the  blurred line  between  benefit denials  and<br><br>          penalties  is  singularly  unhelpful  in the  zero-sum  world  of<br><br>          elective politics.   Because a head-to-head election has a single<br><br>          victor, any benefit conferred on  one candidate is the  effective                  ___<br><br>          equivalent  of a penalty imposed  on all other  aspirants for the<br><br>          same  office.   In  the  last analysis,  then,  Leonard's fancied<br><br>          distinction proves too much.<br><br><br>                                          28<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    While these  three reasons  spell defeat  for Leonard's<br><br>          attempt to distinguish the public financing cases as different in<br><br>          kind from this case, Leonard also proffers a difference-in-degree<br><br>          distinction.     Even  if  some  regulatory   incentives  may  be<br><br>          permissible, she  says, Rhode  Island's incentives are  so strong<br><br>          that  they  destroy the  voluntariness  of  the public  financing<br><br>          system and, therefore, cannot be condoned.<br><br>                    We agree  with Leonard's  main premise:   voluntariness<br><br>          has  proven to be an important factor in judicial ratification of<br><br>          government-sponsored  campaign financing  schemes.    See,  e.g.,                                                                ___   ____<br><br>          Buckley, 424  U.S. at 95;  RNC I, 487  F. Supp. at  285.

Furthermore, there is  a point  at<br><br>          which  regulatory  incentives  stray beyond  the  pale,  creating<br><br>          disparities so profound that  they become impermissibly coercive.<br><br>          It is, however, pellucid that no such compulsion occurred here.<br><br>                    Rhode  Island's law  achieves  a rough  proportionality<br><br>          between   the  advantages   available  to   complying  candidates<br><br>          (including the cap gap) and the restrictions that such candidates<br><br>          must  accept to  receive  these advantages.14   Put  another way,<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               14Indeed,  the   specific  facts  of   Rhode  Island's  1992<br>          gubernatorial  contest support  the conclusion  that the  state's<br>          catalog  of  incentives  is  neither  overly  coercive  nor  even<br>          especially attractive.   Both  Leonard and Governor  Sundlun (who<br>          prevailed  in  the  Democratic  primary and  eventually  won  the<br>          general election)  resisted  the temptations  of  public  funding<br>          despite facing  (a) an opponent in the  primary who had opted for<br>          public funding and  (b) a substantial possibility that  the other<br>          party's candidate in the general election would be receiving such<br><br>                                          29<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          the  state exacts  a  fair  price  from complying  candidates  in<br><br>          exchange  for receipt of the challenged benefits.  While we agree<br><br>          with Leonard that Rhode Island's statutory scheme is not in exact<br><br>          balance    we suspect  that very  few campaign financing  schemes<br><br>          ever  achieve perfect equipoise   we disagree with her claim that<br><br>          the  law is unfairly coercive.   Where, as  here, a non-complying<br><br>          candidate  suffers no  more than  "a countervailing  denial," the<br><br>          statute does not go too far.

Rhode Island has done nothing more  than implement<br><br>          this  principle.  We see no sign  that the state has crossed into<br><br>          forbidden territory;  the contribution cap gap,  as structured by<br><br>          the  Rhode Island  General  Assembly,  neither penalizes  certain<br><br>          classes   of   office-seekers   nor   coerces   candidates   into<br><br>          surrendering their first amendment rights.  In short, Leonard has<br><br>          identified  no  inherent  constitutional  defect  in the  state's<br><br>          voluntary, choice-increasing framework.<br><br>                    2.

The assertion stalls.<br><br>                    In the first place, we have difficulty believing that a<br><br>          statutory  framework  which  merely  presents  candidates with  a<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>          funds.<br><br>                                          30<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          voluntary  alternative  to  an  otherwise  applicable,  assuredly<br><br>          constitutional,  financing option  imposes  any  burden on  first<br><br>          amendment rights.

Thus, it  seems likely  that the          _____<br><br>          challenged   statute  furthers,   rather  than   smothers,  first<br><br>          amendment values.<br><br>                    In the second place, even if the cap gap burdens a non-<br><br>          complying  candidate's  first  amendment  rights  to  some  small<br><br>          extent, and assuming for argument's sake that the state bears the<br><br>          devoir  of  persuasion  in   respect  to  whether  the  statutory<br><br>          framework  is  both  in  service  to  a  compelling  governmental<br><br>          interest and tailored  in a sufficiently narrow manner,  we would<br><br>          still  find Leonard's thesis unpersuasive.  The state need not be<br><br>          completely  neutral   on  the  matter  of   public  financing  of<br><br>          elections.   When, as now,  the legislature has  adopted a public<br><br>          funding  alternative, the  state  possesses a  valid interest  in<br><br>          having candidates  accept public financing because  such programs<br><br>          "facilitate communication  by  candidates with  the  electorate,"<br><br>          Buckley,  424 U.S. at 91,  free candidates from  the pressures of          _______<br><br>          fundraising, see id., and,  relatedly, tend to combat corruption.                       ___ ___<br><br>          See id.;  see also RNC I,  487 F.

Equally  important, the  gap<br><br>          appears to  reflect  a carefully  calibrated  legislative  choice<br><br>          anent the differential risk of quid pro quo corruption in the two                                         ____ ___ ___<br><br>          instances.     In   the  state's   view,  the   many  eligibility<br><br>          requirements  for  public financing  make it  less likely  that a<br><br>          given  contribution will  tend to  corrupt  a candidate.15   That<br><br>          view, too, is plausible.   Ergo, the contribution cap  gap stands<br><br>          on reasonably solid theoretical footing.<br><br>                    For these reasons, we find Rhode  Island's contribution<br><br>          cap gap narrowly tailored and logically related, in  scope, size,<br><br>          and  kind, to  compelling governmental  interests.16   That being<br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               15To  cite  an example,  once it  is  clear that  a publicly<br>          financed candidate's  campaign can reach  the overall fundraising<br>          limits, see R.I. Gen. Laws    17-25-20(2), any single contributor                  ___<br>          to that  campaign becomes less important  because the contributor<br>          can be  "replaced" at no marginal cost.  In other words, the fact<br>          that the campaign  seems bound to  reach the fundraising  ceiling<br>          means that a  given contributor is occupying  a contribution slot<br>          that could  as easily  be occupied  by someone  else.  With  this<br>          distinction in the importance  of individual contributors comes a<br>          corresponding  diminution   in  the   risk  of   corruption  and,<br>          therefore, a diminished justification for  stringent contribution<br>          limits.  See, e.g., Buckley, 424 U.S. at 91, 96.                   ___  ____  _______<br><br>               16We  add a caveat.   We  do not in  any way  imply that the<br>          contribution  cap  gap is  constitutionally  mandated.   A  state<br>          legislature could certainly conclude that a $2,000 contributor to<br>          a  campaign complying with  the spending limits  actually holds a<br>          greater sway with the candidate than does a $1,000 contributor to<br>          an unlimited campaign because the former contribution represents,<br>          in most cases, a greater percentage of the candidate's kitty than<br>          does the latter.  But, the legislature must have a certain amount<br>          of operating  room in this sphere.   The first amendment does not<br>          require  the   courts  to   choose  sides,  at   this  level   of<br>          particularity, in the flux and reflux of policy considerations.<br><br>                                          32<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          so,  it would  be  unduly meddlesome,  hence,  wrong, for  us  to<br><br>          substitute our own  assessment of either an  incentive's value or<br><br>          the perceived risks to  which it is addressed for  the considered<br><br>          judgment  of a state legislature.

Leonard argues that in explicitly guaranteeing state-<br><br>          controlled television  time to qualifying candidates  at no cost,<br><br>          the  state  intends to  exclude  all  other (non-publicly-funded)<br><br>          candidates  from receiving comparable  treatment.

When  a<br><br>          statute provides a benefit  to some, it does not  necessarily bar<br><br>          receipt of the benefit by others.  Cf., e.g., Bowen v.

We believe these          _____________<br><br>          principles apply full bore to R.I. Gen. Laws   17-25-30.<br><br>                    We refuse  to read Rhode Island's  provision of in-kind<br><br>          benefits  in  the   overbold  fashion  that   Leonard  envisions.<br><br>          Instead, we interpret the statute  to mean what it says and  only<br><br>          what  it says:   it  entitles publicly  funded candidates  to use<br><br>          state-controlled television channels without charge   but it does<br><br>          nothing to  interfere with, and does  not contemplate interfering<br><br>          with, the  rights of  privately financed  candidates who  wish to<br><br>          petition  for equal  time and  treatment under  47 U.S.C.    315.<br><br>          Contrary  to Leonard's  suggestion, this interpretation  does not<br><br>          emasculate  R.I.  Gen.  Laws     17-25-30(1)  &  (2); indeed,  by<br><br>          harmonizing  the  statutory  provisions   with  federal  law  and<br><br>          avoiding   possible   preemption,   the    interpretation   lends<br><br>          considerable vitality to the will of the state legislature.  What<br><br>          is  more, the  provisions,  so construed,  further a  substantial<br><br>          purpose:  subsidizing all publicly funded candidates by providing<br><br><br>                                          37<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          them with access to  free television time.   In other words,  the<br><br>          state law makes the public  financing program more attractive not<br><br>          because complying candidates  receive something which their  non-<br><br>          complying counterparts  do  not, but,  rather, because  complying<br><br>          candidates can  be confident that the  expenditure limits imposed<br><br>          in  consequence of  the acceptance  of public financing  will not<br><br>          prevent them from getting their message to the voters.<br><br>                    The bottom  line  reads  as  follows:    there  are  no<br><br>          indications    textual or otherwise    that Rhode  Island's free-<br><br>          television-time   provisions   aim   to  preclude   non-complying<br><br>          candidates  from seeking  either equal  time or  equal treatment;<br><br>          there is a plausible interpretation of the state  enactment which<br><br>          reconciles   it   with   overriding   federal   law;   and   this<br><br>          interpretation gives the statute meaning without jeopardizing its<br><br>          validity.   Because  we  read the  state  law in  this  way,21 47<br><br>          U.S.C.   315 does not preempt R.I. Gen. Laws   17-25-30(1) & (2).<br><br>                    3.   Excessive Entanglement.  Leonard has one last shot                    3.   Excessive Entanglement.                         ______________________<br><br>          in her  sling.  She urges that the provision of in-kind benefits,<br><br>          such  as  free  television  time,  has  a  dangerous  tendency to<br><br>          entangle   government  in  the  internal  workings  of  political<br><br>          campaigns.<br><br>                    The   electoral  process  is  guided  by  legislatively<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               21This interpretation of R.I.  Gen. Laws   17-25-30 requires<br>          that  we  reject   three  other  disparity-presuming  contentions<br>          advanced by  Leonard.  Read in  the manner that we  deem fitting,<br>          the statute neither (1) penalizes a  candidate for exercising his<br>          or her  right  to  boycott  public financing,  (2)  denies  equal<br>          protection  of the laws to such a candidate, nor (3) destroys the<br>          voluntariness of the public financing program.<br><br>                                          38<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          articulated  rules  designed to  ensure  fairness.   A  fine, but<br><br>          important,  line  exists  between this  salutary  rulemaking  and<br><br>          meddlesome  interference in the conduct of elections.  There is a<br><br>          point where government involvement  in the operation of political<br><br>          campaigns may become so pervasive  as to imperil first  amendment<br><br>          values.   Were  a  state to  loan  out  its workers  as  campaign<br><br>          consultants,   for   example,   voters   and   candidates   might<br><br>          legitimately complain that it had gone beyond laying down general<br><br>          rules  for  office-seekers  and  begun tampering  with,  or  even<br><br>          manipulating,  the  electoral process.   Such  entanglement could<br><br>          conceivably  prevent the first  amendment from  accomplishing its<br><br>          fundamental  mission in respect to political  speech:  "to secure<br><br>          the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and<br><br>          antagonistic  sources, and  to assure  unfettered  interchange of<br><br>          ideas for  the bringing  about of  political  and social  changes<br><br>          desired by the  people."  Buckley, 424 U.S. at  49 (citations and                                    _______<br><br>          internal  quotation marks  omitted).   In short,  entanglement of<br><br>          this  insidious  stripe  runs too  great  a  risk  of creating  a<br><br>          convergence of pro-government voices.<br><br>                    Mindful of these concerns, courts must carefully review<br><br>          legislative  enactments that  potentially entangle  government in<br><br>          partisan political  affairs.  In-kind incentives  carry the seeds<br><br>          of  potential  overinvolvement,  especially  when  they implicate<br><br>          access to  state-run organs of communication.   Nevertheless, the<br><br>          first amendment does  not rule out  all in-kind offerings  simply<br><br>          because some of them may be too entangling.  See, e.g., id. at 93                                                       ___  ____  ___<br><br><br>                                          39<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          n.127  (noting   that  the   government's  extension   of  postal<br><br>          privileges furthers first amendment  values).  Legislative bodies<br><br>          (and,  ultimately,  courts)  must  separate   wheat  from  chaff,<br><br>          recognizing that, while some  in-kind benefits may be excessively<br><br>          entangling,  others represent  valid  and innovative  attempts to<br><br>          confront new  concerns in  the ever-changing world  of democratic<br><br>          elections.<br><br>                    In  our  view,  there   is  a  spectrum  of  government<br><br>          subsidization  ranging from pure white  and light gray    a range<br><br>          that  would  include  such  relatively  unintrusive  measures  as<br><br>          supplying public  funding on politically  neutral terms    to jet<br><br>          black and navy blue   a range that would subsume such  relatively<br><br>          intrusive measures  as furnishing  campaign  workers to  specific<br><br>          candidates.   The  closer an  arrangement  trenches to  the  non-<br><br>          intrusive end of the spectrum, the less likely it is to fall prey<br><br>          to a facial  challenge grounded  in the first  amendment.   After<br><br>          all, so long as interference is slight, offering in-kind benefits<br><br>          actually   furthers   first   amendment  values   by   increasing<br><br>          candidates'  available choices  and  enhancing their  ability  to<br><br>          communicate.  See id. at 92-93.                         ___ ___<br><br>                    In this  case, Leonard has advanced  no concrete reason<br><br>          for  believing  that  the  free-television-time  provisions  will<br><br>          excessively  entangle the  state  in the  day-to-day details  and<br><br>          decisions of the campaign.   Because applicable federal laws  and<br><br>          regulations require  equal time  and treatment for  all competing<br><br>          candidates insofar  as the electronic media  are concerned, there<br><br><br>                                          40<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          is  no appreciable  danger of lopsided  state involvement  in the<br><br>          intricate process of scheduling  television appearances.  By like<br><br>          token, there  is  no  demonstrable  risk that  state  power  will<br><br>          influence  candidates'  speech in  a  way  that undermines  first<br><br>          amendment   values.     Accordingly,   there  is   no   excessive<br><br>          entanglement.  See, e.g., id. at 93 n.126 (concluding that claims                         ___  ____  ___<br><br>          of  excessive  governmental  involvement  in  respect  to  public<br><br>          funding  of  political  campaigns were  "wholly  speculative  and<br><br>          hardly a basis for [facial] invalidation").<br><br>          IV.  CONCLUSION          IV.  CONCLUSION<br><br>                    In its journey to ensure the integrity of the electoral<br><br>          process,  a  state legislature  must  march  across the  hallowed<br><br>          ground  on which  fundamental first  amendment rights  take root.<br><br>          The  terrain must  be  negotiated with  circumspection and  care:<br><br>          disparities, in whatever guise, are not casually to be condoned.<br><br>                    Here, the  Rhode Island General Assembly  traversed the<br><br>          minefield with mixed  results.  The disclosure threshold  for PAC<br><br>          contributors,  as   contrasted  with  the   different  disclosure<br><br>          threshold    for   contributors   to   candidates,   creates   an<br><br>          impermissible disparity  violative of  associational  rights.   A<br><br>          second claimed disparity, involving  the contribution cap gap is,<br><br>          in part due  to its relatively  small size, non-penalizing,  non-<br><br>          coercive,  justifiable,  and,  hence, constitutional.    For  all<br><br>          intents and  purposes, the  third claimed disparity  is virtually<br><br>          non-existent:  given the  imperatives of extant federal  law, the<br><br>          free-television-time  provisions  of  the  state  statute  do not<br><br>          produce  significant  differences in  the  benefits available  to<br><br>          various candidates for the same office.  Thus, we, like the court<br><br>                                          41<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          below,   find   that  R.I.   Gen.   Laws      17-25-15(c)(1)   is<br><br>          unconstitutional, but  that the  plaintiffs' challenges  to other<br><br>          portions of Rhode Island's campaign finance law are bootless.<br><br>                    Nihilo ulterius requiremus pergere.  The judgment below                    ______ ________ __________ _______<br><br>          will be<br><br><br><br>          Affirmed.          Affirmed.          ________<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                          42<br><br><br><br></pre>
