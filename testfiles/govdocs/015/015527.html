 1. Reflects actual required reserves, with no adjustments to eliminate the effects of discontinuities, or "breaks", associated with 
    regulatory changes in reserve requirements.
 2. Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks plus vault cash used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 3. The monetary base, not break-adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, consists of (1) total reserves plus (2) required clearing balances
    and adjustments to compensate for float at Federal Reserve Banks plus (3) the currency component of the money stock plus (4), for all 
    quarterly reporters on the "Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash" and for all those weekly reporters whose 
    vault cash exceeds their required reserves, the difference between current vault cash and the amount applied to satisfy current reserve 
    requirements. Currency and vault cash figures are measured over computation periods ending on Mondays.
 4. Excludes required clearing balances and adjustments to compensate for float and includes other off-balance sheet "as-of" adjustments.
 5. Vault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements. It includes only vault cash held by those banks and thrifts that are not exempt
    from reserve requirements. Dates refer to the maintenance periods in which the vault cash can be used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 6. All vault cash held during the lagged computation period by "bound" institutions (i.e., those whose required reserves exceed their vault 
    cash) plus the amount of vault cash applied during the maintenance period by "nonbound" institutions (i.e., those whose vault cash 
    exceeds their required reserves) to satisfy current reserve requirements.
 7. Total vault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements, held by depository institutions not exempt from reserve requirements, minus the
    amount used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 8. Consists of carryover only at depository institutions maintaining reserves on the basis of two-week maintenance periods. Reflects excess (+) 
    or deficit (-) reserves eligible to be carried forward into the two-week reserve maintenance period ending on the date shown.

 p--preliminary		pe--preliminary estimate
 1. Figures reflect adjustments for discontinuities, or "breaks", associated with 
    regulatory changes in reserve requirements.
 2. Break-adjusted total reserves equal break-adjusted required reserves (Table 3, 
    column 3) plus excess reserves NSA (Table 1, column 5).
 3. To adjust required reserves for discontinuities due to regulatory changes in 
    in reserve requirements, a multiplicative procedure is used to estimate what 
    required reserves would have been in past periods had current reserve 
    requirements been in effect. Break-adjusted required reserves are equal to 
    break-adjusted required reserves against transactions deposits.
 4. The break-adjusted monetary base equals (1) break-adjusted total reserves plus 
    (2) the (unadjusted) currency component of the money stock plus (3), for all 
    quarterly reporters on the "Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and 
    Vault Cash" and for all those weekly reporters whose vault cash exceeds their 
    required reserves, the break-adjusted difference between current vault cash and 
    the amount applied to satisfy current reserve requirements.
