  <h3>Export Control Program Description And Licensing Policy</h3>
  <p>On April 16, 1987, the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom created the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to limit the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Member countries agreed to further expand the MTCR controls in 1993 to include missile delivery systems for all types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The MTCR now has 34 member countries. See Appendix II for a complete list of MTCR member countries. In addition, several countries, including Israel, Romania, and Slovakia, unilaterally adhere to the MTCR Guidelines.</p>
  <p>The MTCR Guidelines and the Equipment, Software, and Technology Annex form the basis for U.S. missile technology controls. The MTCR Guidelines provide licensing policy, procedures, review factors, and standard assurances on missile technology exports. The Annex is the list of missile-related items and is divided into two categories. Category I items include missile systems and major subsystems, production facilities, and production equipment for missile systems capable of delivering a 500 kg payload to at least a 300 km range. Category II items include materials, components, and production and test equipment associated with Category I items, as well as missile subsystems, production facilities, and production equipment for missile systems with a 300 km range, regardless of payload.</p>
  <p>The Department of Commerce is responsible for administering controls on manufacturing equipment for Category I items, and all dual-use items in Category II. There are approximately 120 entries on the Commerce Control List (CCL) that are subject to missile technology controls. Category I items have a strong presumption of denial, and the transfer of production facilities for Category I items is prohibited. The Department of Commerce will approve the export of Category II items only after a case-by-case review. The United States observes the multilateral commitment to honor the denial of licenses by other members and to support such denials through a &ldquo;no undercut&rdquo; policy. This policy enhances efforts to prevent missile proliferation and prevents unfair commercial advantage among regime members.</p>
  <p>MTCR member countries seek to foster the cooperation of non-member countries in limiting the spread of delivery systems for WMD and have focused such efforts in an MTCR-sponsored series of workshops and seminars. This effort &ndash; begun in 1996 &ndash; allows MTCR members and invited non-members to explore different approaches to improve export controls and prevent missile proliferation. In June 2004, representatives from the Department of Commerce attended a seminar on missile technology and intangible technology transfers, hosted by Germany. </p>
  <h4>Licensing Requirements and Licensing Policy</h4>
  <p>In summary, the licensing requirements and policy for missile technology controls described in Parts 742.5 and 744.3 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>A. </strong>The U.S. Government requires a license for the export or reexport to all destinations except Canada of those dual-use items specifically identified on the CCL as controlled for missile technology reasons. This exclusion for Canada is currently under review.</p>
  <p>On May 4, 2004, the Department of Commerce revised the EAR to implement changes to the MTCR Annex that the member countries agreed to at the September 2003 Plenary in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The rule added a new control for unmanned aerial vehicles designed or modified for aerosol delivery. The rule also expanded controls to capture an additional compound used as a missile oxidizer. Also, this rule published clarified telemetry controls, existing controls on propellant mixers, and existing language on launch support equipment (69 FR 24508).</p>
  <p>The U.S. Government controls items subject to the EAR due to missile-related end-use or end-user concerns. These controls are part of the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI), announced by the President on December 13, 1990. The U.S. missile catch-all policy meets U.S. nonproliferation objectives and is consistent with the MTCR Guidelines.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On November 8, 2004, the Department published a rule that revises the end-use/end-user licensing requirements under section 744.3 of the EAR requiring a license for the export, reexport, or transfer of any commodity, software, or technology, if the exporter knows that the item will be:
      <ul>
        <li> Used in the design, development, production or use of rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles capable of a range of at least 300 kilometers in or by specific countries (Country Group D:4, EAR, Part 740, Supplement No. 1);</li>
        <li>Used, anywhere in the world, in rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles, regardless of range capabilities, for the delivery of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; or </li>
        <li>Used in the design, development, production, or use of any rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles in or by specific countries, when the exporter is unable to determine either the range capabilities or end use (69 FR 64657).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In addition, the U.S. Government may inform an exporter or reexporter that a license is required due to an unacceptable risk that the items may be used in, or diverted to, missile-related proliferation activities anywhere in the world. </li>
    <li>No U.S. person may knowingly &ldquo;support&rdquo; such an export, reexport, or transfer without a license. &ldquo;Support&rdquo; is defined as any action, including financing, transportation, or freight forwarding, that facilitates the export, reexport, or transfer of these items.</li>
    <li>In addition, no U.S. person may, without a license, perform any contract, service, or employment knowing that it will directly assist in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of missiles or missile-related projects in, or by, a country listed in Country Group D:4.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>B. </strong>The Department of Commerce will review applications for licenses on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. When the Department of Commerce determines that an export will make such a contribution, the Department will deny the application.</p>
  <h4>Analysis of Controls as Required by Section 6(f) of the Act</h4>
  <h4>A. The Purpose of the Controls</h4>
  <p>These controls curtail the availability of goods and technology and other support that could contribute to missile proliferation. U.S. export controls on specific types of missile-related equipment and technology, in coordination with other supplier countries, limit the proliferation of missile systems and related technology. These controls complement U.S. and international nuclear, chemical, and biological nonproliferation efforts by blocking the development of unmanned delivery systems for WMD. These controls provide U.S. support to the collective effort of the MTCR to address mounting international concern regarding missile proliferation.</p>
  <h4>B. Considerations and/or Determinations of the Secretary of Commerce</h4>
  <p><strong>1. Probability of Achieving the Intended Foreign Policy Purpose.</strong> The Secretary has determined that these controls are likely to achieve the intended foreign policy purpose, in light of other factors, including the limited foreign availability of these MT-controlled items from other countries; and that the foreign policy purpose has been in part achieved through negotiations. Although some controlled items are available from other countries, cooperation among the United States, its MTCR partners, and other like-minded countries, many of which are major producers of the items under control, has hindered the efforts of proliferators to develop or acquire militarily-effective missiles. The Secretary has determined that extending these controls is likely to limit the spread of missile delivery systems.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Compatibility with Foreign Policy Objectives.</strong> The Secretary has determined that these controls are compatible with U.S. foreign policy objectives and that the extension of these controls will not have any significant adverse foreign policy consequences. Halting the spread of missiles and related equipment and technology worldwide is a key U.S. national security and nonproliferation objective. Missile technology export controls are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving this objective. U.S. membership in the MTCR complements existing nuclear, chemical, and biological nonproliferation policies by curbing the spread of missile technology and equipment for the delivery of WMD.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Reaction of Other Countries.</strong> The Secretary has determined that any adverse reaction to these controls is not likely to render the controls ineffective, nor will any adverse reaction by other countries be counter-productive to U.S. foreign policy interests. The United States is confident that other members of and unilateral adherents to the MTCR, many of which are also the leading suppliers of missile-related technology, will continue to support and strengthen this control regime. MTCR partners share information regarding denials of Annex items and are committed to a &ldquo;no undercut policy.&rdquo; MTCR partners also share information about potential activities of proliferation concern, and have cooperated to interdict specific shipments of proliferation concern. The number of MTCR members and other countries willing to cooperate with the regime has increased over the past few years. Finally, the United States and its MTCR partners are actively engaged in an outreach program to encourage additional countries to adhere to the Guidelines and implement effective export controls on MTCR items.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Economic Impact on U.S. Industry.</strong> The Secretary has determined that any adverse effect of these controls on the U.S. economy, including on the competitive position of the United States in the international economy, does not exceed the benefit to U.S. foreign policy objectives. Only a narrow list of items is subject to missile controls, and the effect on overall U.S. trade is limited. The commitment by MTCR to a &ldquo;no undercut policy&rdquo; helps ensure that no member obtains an unfair commercial advantage in the international marketplace.</p>
  <p>In FY 2004, the Department of Commerce approved 592 applications, valued at $387 million, for the export or reexport of missile-technology controlled items. In addition, the Department denied 4 applications valued at $2 million, and returned without action 42 applications valued at $9.9 million. Of those license applications returned without action, the largest group was returned because regulations were revised and licenses were no longer required. Comparatively few licenses for missile technology items are denied because: (1) exporters do not generally pursue transactions they understand will be rejected (based on the applicable licensing policy); and (2) most of the transactions are to countries that do not pose missile proliferation concerns (e.g., MTCR partner countries). Under the missile EPCI control, the Department approved 347 applications, valued at $67.7 million. Additionally, the Department denied 41 licenses valued at $4.7 million, and returned without action 163 EPCI missile cases, valued at $18.3 million. Among the cases returned without action, a significant portion were returned to the applicant because a thorough review revealed no proliferation concerns with the transaction. </p>
  <p>On September 22, 2004, as part of the U.S.-India Next Steps in Strategic Partnership, the Department of Commerce published a rule that removed the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Headquarters from the Department of Commerce Entity List, and removed the licensing requirements for items subject to the EAR having a classification of EAR99 or a classification where the third through fifth digits of the Export Commodity Classification Number (ECCN) are &ldquo;999,&rdquo; e.g., XX999, for the seven ISRO subsidiaries on the Entity List. The Department of Commerce anticipates that this change should significantly reduce the number of EPCI missile license applications processed in the future (69 FR 56693).</p>
  <p><strong>5. Effective Enforcement of Controls. </strong>The Secretary has determined the United States has the ability to effectively enforce these controls. Multilateral controls on missile technology provide a strong framework for cooperative enforcement efforts overseas. However, there are challenges for the enforcement of controls on dual-use goods related to missile development. First, it is difficult to detect and investigate cases under the &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; standard set by the EPCI &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; provision. Second, some countries have different standards for &ldquo;catch-all,&rdquo; which complicates law enforcement cooperation. Third, identifying illegal exports and reexports of missile-related goods requires significant resources.</p>
  <p>To enforce these controls effectively, the Department of Commerce continues to focus on preventive enforcement, including an outreach program to educate companies about export controls and to increase awareness of &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; that may indicate risky transactions. This program is an important component of the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s efforts to prevent companies from illegally exporting dual-use products or equipment that could be used to make missiles. Recognizing the importance of export enforcement, the MTCR held its fourth Enforcement Experts meeting at the MTCR Plenary in Seoul, South Korea, in October 2004.</p>
  <h4>C. Consultation with Industry</h4>
  <p>The Department of Commerce normally holds discussions with industry representatives on issues involving the MTCR Annex through the Transportation Technical Advisory Committee (TransTAC), and other relevant TACs as appropriate. Further, the Department of Commerce participates in interagency working groups that review proposed changes to the Annex, and engages in discussions of the proposals with companies that have relevant expertise.</p>
  <p>In a September 28, 2004, Federal Register notice, the Department of Commerce solicited comments from industry on the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy-based export controls. Comments were solicited from all six of the Department&rsquo;s TACs, which advise the Department, as well as from the President&rsquo;s Export Council Subcommittee on Export Administration. Comments also were solicited from the public via the BIS Web page. The review period closed on November 19, and 12 comments were received. </p>
  <p>One comment addressed multilateral control regimes including the MTCR. The commentator asserted that the language in the EAR differs significantly from that in the multilateral texts and, therefore, these controls are properly considered unilateral controls rather than multilateral ones. He suggested numerous changes to bring the EAR into compliance with the various multilateral texts to eliminate these unilateral controls and make sure that the U.S. controls conform with commitments made to multilateral organizations. The commentator also argued that greater compliance by members of multilateral regimes could be achieved if the United States were to demonstrate a greater commitment to work cooperatively with other countries to reduce WMD. </p>
  <p>Another comment expressed concerns about controls on resins, which are listed in ECCN 1C111.b(2) as controlled for MT reasons. The company said the uncertainty and delay in the licensing process has a significant negative impact on their business. Such uncertainty and delay has led customers to seek the materials from other sources, including countries that are not MTCR members like China. To illustrate their point, the company cited the growth in the past 30 years of a number of facilities around the world that can produce items in this ECCN. A detailed review of all comments received can be found in Appendix I.</p>
  <h4>D. Consultation with Other Countries</h4>
  <p>Consultation with other MTCR members is a fundamental element of U.S. missile technology control policy. Consultations with non-MTCR countries also are essential to U.S. missile nonproliferation policy. The U.S. Government shares information about activities of concern with other countries and seeks to prevent or stop certain transactions of missile proliferation concern. The United States also shares denial information with its MTCR partners.</p>
  <p>As cited earlier, the Department of Commerce published an amendment to the EAR on May 4, 2004, to implement changes to the MTCR Annex that were agreed to by the United States and its MTCR partners at the September 2003 Plenary meeting.</p>
  <h4>E. Alternative Means</h4>
  <p>The missile sanction provisions in Section 73 of the Arms Export Control Act, and Section 11B of the Export Administration Act, provide for the imposition of export, import, and procurement sanctions on foreign entities engaged in certain kinds of activities relating to the transfer of MTCR Annex items to non-MTCR adherent countries. In the past, the United States has imposed missile sanctions on entities in China, Egypt, India, Iran, Macedonia, Moldova, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, and Syria. Missile sanctions are used to encourage the governments of the sanctioned entities to adopt responsible nonproliferation behavior and to send a clear message about the United States&rsquo; strong commitment to missile nonproliferation.</p>
  <p>The United States and its MTCR partners are continuing their diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to adhere unilaterally to the MTCR Guidelines. Such efforts are aimed at encouraging non-MTCR members to implement and enforce effective missile technology export controls. The United States has an obligation to maintain and renew its export controls based on its membership in the MTCR, yet has pursued alternative means to achieve the purpose of the controls through its consultations with non-MTCR countries.</p>
  <h4>F. Foreign Availability</h4>
  <p>Possible suppliers of missile technology that are not MTCR members include, but are not limited to, China (PRC), North Korea, Egypt, India, Israel, and Taiwan. Some of these countries, such as Israel, adhere unilaterally to the MTCR Guidelines and apply MTCR-type controls. The United States continues to approach other nations that produce MTCR Annex-controlled items to secure their cooperation in controlling the foreign availability of these items and to urge their vigilance in applying MTCR Guidelines to help prevent missile proliferation. The U.S. Government has imposed sanctions on entities in a number of countries when those entities have not altered their proliferation behavior.</p>
