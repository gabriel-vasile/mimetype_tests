                 THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION:  DECEMBER 1997


     Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially in December, following a
similar increase in November, and the unemployment rate was about unchanged
at 4.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Labor reported today.  Nonfarm payroll employment grew by 370,000, with
gains occurring in most industry divisions.

Unemployment (Household Survey Data)

     Both the number of unemployed persons, 6.4 million, and the
unemployment rate, 4.7 percent, were essentially unchanged in December,
after seasonal adjustment.  A year earlier the rate had been 5.3 percent.
The jobless rate for adult men returned to 4.1 percent in December after
falling to 3.9 percent in November.  The unemployment rates for other major
worker groups--adult women (4.0 percent), teenagers (14.3 percent), whites
(3.9 percent), blacks (9.9 percent), and Hispanics (7.5 percent)--showed
little or no change over the month.  (See tables A-1 and A-2.)

Total Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)

     Total employment was about unchanged in December, at 130.8 million
(seasonally adjusted), following a substantial increase in November.  The
number of employed persons has increased by 2.6 million since December
1996, after adjusting for the change in the population controls made in
January 1997.  The proportion of the population with jobs, the employment-
population ratio, was at an all-time high of 64.1 percent.  (See table A-1.)

     About 8.1 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) held more than one
job in December.  These multiple jobholders made up 6.2 percent of all
employed persons.  (See table A-9.)

     Both the civilian labor force, 137.2 million (seasonally adjusted),
and the labor force participation rate, 67.2 percent, were essentially
unchanged over the month.  (See table A-1.)

Persons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)

     About 1.5 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally
attached to the labor force in December.  These were people who wanted and
were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12
months but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for
work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.

     The number of discouraged workers--a subset of the marginally attached
who were not currently looking for jobs specifically because they believed
no jobs were available for them--was 345,000 in December, virtually the same
as a year earlier.  (See table A-9.)

Industry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)

     Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 370,000 in December to 123.9
million, after seasonal adjustment; over the year, payroll employment
increased by 3.2 million.  In December, services had the largest job gain,
and growth continued in most other industries, including manufacturing and
construction.  (See table B-1.)

     Manufacturing employment increased by 39,000 in December, bringing the
total job gain for 1997 to 230,000.  In December, growth continued for
industrial machinery and equipment, aircraft and parts, electronic
components and accessories, and fabricated metals.  These industries added
a total of 189,000 jobs over the year.  Several construction-related
industries also had notable increases in December; in fact, lumber and wood
products had the largest job gain in manufacturing.  Employment in motor
vehicles and equipment declined by 9,000 in December but increased by
25,000 over the year.

     The construction industry posted a substantial job gain for the second
straight month.  The increase of 50,000 jobs in December brought the total
gain for 1997 to 209,000, not quite as robust as the 289,000 added in the
prior year.  In December, special trade contractors showed the largest gain
(25,000), and heavy construction had its first increase (11,000) since
August.

     Within the service-producing sector, employment in the services
industry rose by 181,000 in December.  Business services accounted for
nearly half of this growth, with strong gains in both personnel supply
services (45,000) and computer and data processing services (17,000).  In
personnel supply, both help supply services and employment agencies
contributed to the increase.  Computer services accounted for 1 in every 20
jobs added in 1997.  In December, health services had an above-average gain
(26,000), as hospital employment rose by 12,000.  Engineering and
management services also showed a large increase (26,000) in December; like
computer services, this small industry accounted for a relatively large
share of job growth in 1997.

     Retail trade employment rose by 52,000 in December, with nearly all of
the growth occurring in eating and drinking places and miscellaneous retail
establishments.  Employment in department stores was essentially unchanged,
after seasonal adjustment, following a 34,000 increase in November.

     Employment in finance, insurance, and real estate increased by 23,000.
Commercial banks and security and commodity brokerages continued their
steady growth, and the insurance industry rounded out its strongest quarter
in over a decade by adding 12,000 jobs.  Employment growth also continued
in wholesale trade with widespread increases in durable goods distribution.
In the communications industry, job growth has picked up recently, with an
increase of 6,000 in December and gains totaling 22,000 in the fourth
quarter.  Telephone communications accounted for the recent strength.  In

                                  - 4 -

contrast, transportation employment declined in November and December,
following gains totaling 182,000 during the first 10 months of the year.
While the trucking industry has contributed to this recent weakness,
December's drop reflected an employment decline in air courier services.

     In December, state and local government employment continued to trend
upward, while federal employment continued its downward drift.

Weekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)

     The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory workers on
private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.2 hour in December to 34.6 hours,
seasonally adjusted, reversing most of the prior month’s increase.  The
manufacturing workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 42.3 hours, a post-World
War II high, and factory overtime remained at 4.9 hours.  (See table B-2.)

     The index of aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory
workers on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.2 percent to 142.5
(1982=100), seasonally adjusted.  The manufacturing index rose by 0.6
percent to 110.2.  (See table B-5.)

Hourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)

     Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on
private nonfarm payrolls edged up 1 cent in December to $12.48, seasonally
adjusted.  Average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5 percent to $431.81,
reflecting the decline in weekly hours.  Over the year, average hourly
earnings rose by 3.7 percent and average weekly earnings by 3.4 percent.
(See table B-3.)

                 ________________________________________

     The Employment Situation for January 1998 is scheduled to be released
on Friday, February 6, at 8:30 A.M. (EST).

           Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data

     At the end of each calendar year, BLS routinely updates the seasonal
adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the Current
Population Survey (also referred to as the household survey) to incorporate
the experience of that year.  This year, seasonally adjusted data for
January 1994-December 1997 are subject to revision.  (Seasonally adjusted
establishment data will be revised in June, concurrent with the
introduction of annual benchmark adjustments.)

     Table B summarizes the effects of the revisions on the overall
unemployment rate since January 1997.  Rates for 4 months were revised, in
each case by 0.1 percentage point.  Revised seasonally adjusted data for
major labor force series since December 1996 appear in table C.

     The January 1998 issue of Employment and Earnings will contain the new
seasonal adjustment factors for major series for the January-June 1998
period.  The publication also will contain a description of the current
seasonal adjustment methodology and revised data for the most recent 13
months or quarters for all regularly published tables containing seasonally
adjusted household survey data.  Historical seasonally adjusted monthly and
quarterly data also are available on the Internet.  Internet users can
access these data from the ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf
directory.  Historical data for the household series contained in the "A"
tables of this release also can be accessed at the end of the Employment
Situation news release on the BLS internet site.

               Planned Changes in the Household Survey Data
     Effective with the release of data for January 1998, improvements will
be introduced into the composite estimation procedures used in the
household survey.  These changes will simplify processing of the monthly
labor force data at BLS and will allow users of the survey microdata to
replicate more easily the official estimates released by BLS.  In addition,
there will be a slight decrease in the variance of some major estimates,
particularly employment levels and the over-the-month change in those
levels.  The new procedures are expected to produce somewhat lower
estimates of the civilian labor force and employment.  Also effective with
the release of January data, minor revisions will be introduced into the
population controls used for the household survey.  These changes and their
effect on the estimates of labor force change and composition will be
described in an article in the February 1998 issue of Employment and
Earnings.

     Next month's release also will introduce a new table showing labor
force data for persons 25 years and over by major educational attainment
categories.

Explanatory Note


 This news release presents statistics from two major surveys, the Current
Population Survey (household survey) and the Current Employment Statistics
survey (establishment survey).  The household survey provides the
information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment that appears
in the A tables, marked HOUSEHOLD DATA.  It is a sample survey of about
50,000 households  conducted by the Bureau of the Census  for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS).

 The establishment survey provides the information on the employment,
hours, and earnings of workers on nonfarm payrolls that appears in the B
tables, marked ESTABLISHMENT DATA.  This information is collected from
payroll records by BLS in cooperation with State agencies.  In June 1997,
the sample included about 390,000 establishments employing about 48 million
people.

 For both surveys, the data for a given month  relate to a particular week
or pay period.  In the household survey,  the reference week is generally
the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month.  In the
establishment survey, the reference  period is the pay period including the
12th, which may or may not correspond directly to the calendar week.

Coverage, definitions, and differences between surveys

 Household survey.  The sample  is selected  to reflect the entire
civilian noninstitutional population.  Based on responses to a series of
questions on work and job search activities, each person  16 years and over
in a sample household is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the
labor force.

 People are classified as employed if they did any work at all as paid
employees during the reference week; worked in their own business,
profession, or on their own farm; or worked without pay at least 15 hours
in a family business or farm.  People are also counted as employed if they
were  temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness, bad weather,
vacation, labor-management disputes, or personal reasons.

 People are classified as unemployed if they meet all of the following
criteria:  They had no employment during the  reference week; they were
available for work at that time; and they made specific efforts to find
employment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference
week.  Persons laid off from  a job and expecting recall   need not be
looking for work to be counted as unemployed.  The unemployment data
derived from the household survey in no way depend upon the eligibility for
or receipt of unemployment insurance benefits.

 The civilian labor force  is the sum of  employed and  unemployed
persons.  Those not classified as employed or unemployed are not in the
labor force.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a percent
of the  labor force.  The labor force participation rate is the labor force
as a percent of the population, and the employment-population ratio is the
employed as a percent of the population.

 Establishment survey.  The sample establishments are drawn from private
nonfarm businesses such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as
Federal, State, and local government entities.  Employees on nonfarm
payrolls are those who received pay for any part of the reference pay
period, including persons on paid leave.  Persons are counted in each job
they hold.  Hours and earnings data are for private businesses and relate
only to production workers in the goods-producing sector and nonsupervisory
workers in the service-producing sector.

 Differences in employment estimates.  The numerous conceptual and
methodological differences between the household and establishment surveys
result in important distinctions in the employment estimates derived from
the surveys.  Among these are:

 --The household survey includes agricultural workers, the self-employed,
unpaid family workers, and private household workers among the employed.
These groups are excluded from the establishment survey.

 --The household survey includes people on unpaid leave among the
employed. The establishment survey does not.

 --The household survey is limited to  workers 16 years of age and older.
The establishment survey is not limited by age.

 --The  household survey has no duplication of individuals, because
individuals  are counted only once, even if they hold more than one job. In
the establishment survey, employees working at more than one job  and thus
appearing on more than one payroll would be counted separately for each
appearance.

 Other differences between the two surveys are described in   "Comparing
Employment Estimates from Household and Payroll Surveys," which may be
obtained from BLS upon request.

Seasonal adjustment

 Over the course of a year, the size of the nation's labor force and the
levels of employment and unemployment undergo sharp fluctuations due to
such seasonal events as changes in weather, reduced or expanded production,
harvests, major holidays, and the opening and closing of schools.  The
effect of such seasonal  variation can  be  very large; seasonal
fluctuations may account for as much as 95 percent of the month-to-month
changes in unemployment.

 Because these seasonal events follow a more or less regular pattern each
year, their influence on statistical trends can be eliminated by adjusting
the statistics from month to month.  These adjustments make nonseasonal
developments, such as declines in economic activity or increases in the
participation of women in the labor force, easier to spot.  For example,
the large number of youth entering the labor force each June is likely to
obscure any other changes that have taken place relative to May, making it
difficult to determine if the level of economic activity has risen or
declined.  However, because the effect of students finishing school in
previous years is known, the statistics for the current year can be
adjusted to allow for a comparable change.  Insofar as the seasonal
adjustment is made correctly, the adjusted figure provides a more useful
tool with which to analyze changes in economic activity.

 In both the household and establishment surveys, most seasonally adjusted
series are independently adjusted.  However, the adjusted series for many
major estimates, such as total payroll employment, employment in most major
industry divisions, total employment, and unemployment are computed by
aggregating independently adjusted component series.  For example, total
unemployment is derived by summing the adjusted series for four major age-
sex components; this differs from the unemployment estimate that would be
obtained by directly adjusting the total or by combining the duration,
reasons, or more detailed age categories.

 The numerical factors used to make the seasonal adjustments are
recalculated twice a year.  For the household survey, the factors are
calculated for the January-June period and again for the July-December

                                  - 7 -

period.  For the establishment survey, updated factors for seasonal
adjustment are calculated for the May-October period and introduced along
with new benchmarks, and again for the November-April period.  In both
surveys, revisions to historical data are made once a year.

Reliability of the estimates

 Statistics based on the household and establishment surveys are subject
to both sampling and nonsampling error.  When a sample rather than the
entire population is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates
may differ from the "true" population values they represent.  The exact
difference, or sampling error, varies depending on the particular sample
selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the
estimate.  There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that
an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard
errors from the "true" population value because of sampling error.  BLS
analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence.

 For example, the confidence interval for the monthly change in total
employment from the household survey is on the order of plus or minus
376,000.  Suppose the estimate of total employment increases by 100,000
from one month to the next.  The 90-percent confidence interval on the
monthly change would range from -276,000 to 476,000 (100,000 +/- 376,000).
These figures do not mean that the sample results are off by these
magnitudes, but rather that there is about a 90-percent chance that the
"true" over-the-month change lies within this interval.  Since this range
includes values of less than zero, we could not say with confidence that
employment had, in fact, increased.  If, however, the reported employment
rise was half a million, then all of the values within the 90-percent
confidence interval would be greater than zero.  In this case, it is likely
(at least a 90-percent chance) that an employment rise had, in fact,
occurred.  The 90-percent confidence interval for the monthly change in
unemployment is +/- 258,000, and for the monthly change in the unemployment
rate it is +/- .21 percentage point.

 In general, estimates involving many individuals or establishments have
lower standard errors (relative to the size of the estimate) than estimates
which are based on a small number of observations.  The precision of
estimates is also improved when the data are cumulated over time such as
for quarterly and annual averages.  The seasonal adjustment process can
also improve the stability of the monthly estimates.

 The household and establishment surveys are also affected by nonsampling
error.  Nonsampling errors can occur for many reasons, including the
failure to sample a segment of the population, inability to obtain
information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness
of respondents to provide correct information on a timely basis, mistakes
made by respondents, and errors made in the collection or processing of the
data.

 For example, in the establishment survey, estimates for the most recent 2
months are based on substantially incomplete returns; for this reason,
these estimates are labeled preliminary in the tables.  It is only after
two successive revisions to a monthly estimate, when nearly all sample
reports have been received, that the estimate is considered final.

 Another major source of nonsampling error in the establishment survey is
the inability to capture, on a timely basis, employment generated by new
firms.  To correct for this systematic underestimation of employment growth
(and other sources of error), a process known as bias adjustment is
included in the survey's estimating procedures, whereby a specified number
of jobs is added to the monthly sample-based change.  The size of the

                                  - 8 -

monthly bias adjustment is based largely on past relationships between the
sample-based estimates of employment and the total counts of employment
described below.

 The sample-based estimates from the establishment survey are adjusted
once a year (on a lagged basis) to universe counts of payroll employment
obtained from administrative records of the unemployment insurance program.
The difference between the March sample-based employment estimates and the
March universe counts is known as a benchmark revision, and serves as a
rough proxy for total survey error.  The new benchmarks also incorporate
changes in the classification of industries.  Over the past decade, the
benchmark revision for total nonfarm employment has averaged 0.2 percent,
ranging from zero to 0.6 percent.

              NOTE: This range of alternative measures of labor underutilization replaces the U1-U7 range published in table A-7
          of this release prior to 1994.  Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking
          for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the recent past.
          Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently
          looking for a job.  Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available for full-time
          work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.  For further information, see "BLS introduces new range of
          alternative unemployment measures,"  in the October 1995 issue of the Monthly Labor Review.  Beginning in January 1997,
          data reflect revised population controls used in the household survey.  Seasonally adjusted data have been revised based
          on the experience through December 1997.
