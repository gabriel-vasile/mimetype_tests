Ricardo Davila-Bardales asks us<br>                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.<br>                           _____________<br><br>          to review a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in<br><br>          which the BIA affirmed  an Immigration Judge's (IJ's) deportation<br><br>          order.   The parties agree that the BIA's decision rests upon the<br><br>          IJ's  finding that in late July of 1989 Davila-Bardales, then age<br><br>          15,  entered this  country unlawfully,  without inspection  by an<br><br>          immigration  officer.  See 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(1)(B) (1988 & Supp.<br>                                 ___<br><br>          IV 1992).   The parties also agree that rules  of the Immigration<br><br>          and Naturalization Service (INS)  require "clear, unequivocal and<br><br>          convincing" evidentiary support for  such a finding.  8  C.F.R.  <br><br>          242.14(a) (1993).  They disagree about whether the INS, under its<br><br>          own  rules and  practices, could  properly consider  the evidence<br><br>          that  showed unlawful entry in this case   evidence that consists<br><br>          primarily of Davila-Bardales's own statements and admissions.<br><br>                    The proof before the  IJ  featured petitioner's answers<br><br>          to  questions  that  the IJ  posed  directly  to petitioner  (and<br><br>          several  other   individuals  then  before  the   judge)  at  the<br><br>          immigration  hearing.     These  questions  were   all  based  on<br><br>          information  in the  Order  to  Show  Cause  (the  OSC),  a  form<br><br>          indicating that  Davila-Bardales was  deportable.1  The  IJ asked<br><br>          the petitioner whether  he was  a "native and  citizen of  Peru,"<br><br>          whether he "entered the  United States near Laredo, Texas,  on or<br><br>          about July 27,  1989," and whether he did  so "through the river,<br><br>          through the  fence, or conceal[ing] [him]self in some way without<br><br>          presenting  [him]self to an  Immigration Officer" for inspection.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1The OSC is reproduced in Appendix A hereto.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Davila-Bardales answered all these questions affirmatively.<br><br>                    The problem with this evidence is that Davila-Bardales,<br><br>          then under the age of 16, was not represented by counsel, nor was<br><br>          a  guardian, relative,  or friend  present to  advise him  at the<br><br>          hearing.  An INS regulation says that an IJ<br><br>                    shall    not    accept   an    admission   of<br>                    deportability    from     an    unrepresented<br>                    respondent who is .  . . under age 16  and is<br>                    not  accompanied by  a guardian,  relative or<br>                    friend . . . .<br><br>          8 C.F.R.   242.16(b).  And, as the INS concedes,  this regulation<br><br>          removes the sting from these particular admissions.<br><br>                    A  second set  of  evidentiary items  contained in  the<br><br>          record of  the immigration  hearing consists of  the petitioner's<br><br>          answers  to further  questions that  the IJ  asked after  he (the<br><br>          judge) realized that petitioner's  age and lack of representation<br><br>          created  a potential legal problem.  At that point, the IJ showed<br><br>          Davila-Bardales  a   form,  called   a  form  I-213,2   which  is<br><br>          apparently a record of an officer's interview of Davila-Bardales,<br><br>          made  soon after the Border Patrol apprehended him near Laredo on<br><br>          the evening of his alleged entry.  After handing  Davila-Bardales<br><br>          a copy of the form, the IJ pointed out that it said  that Davila-<br><br>          Bardales  was "a native and  citizen of Peru,"  who "last entered<br><br>          the United States  on July 27, 1989,  near Laredo," and was  "not<br><br>          inspected at that time."  In response,  Davila-Bardales said that<br><br>          "everything is correct."<br><br>                    We are not certain  whether the INS means to  rely upon<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2This form is reproduced in Appendix B hereto.<br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          this  statement  ("everything  is  correct")  as  itself  showing<br><br>          deportability.   In any  event, the INS  cannot do so  due to the<br><br>          very   same  regulation   that  prevents   it  from   relying  on<br><br>          petitioner's  responses to the OSC.  Courts should not exalt form<br><br>          over  substance  without  compelling  reason,  particularly  when<br><br>          important rights  are at stake.   So it is here:   we perceive no<br><br>          functional  difference  between  asking  petitioner  whether  the<br><br>          allegations  in the OSC are true and asking him whether identical<br><br>          allegations  in  the  form  I-213 are  true;  and,  moreover,  we<br><br>          perceive   no   compelling  reason   for  making   an  artificial<br><br>          distinction.    Hence,  petitioner's  statement,   considered  as<br><br>          substantive evidence, would seem "an admission of  deportability"<br><br>          made  to  the  IJ  by   an "unrepresented  respondent . . . under<br><br>          age  16" who  was "not  accompanied by  a guardian,  relative, or<br><br>          friend,"  8 C.F.R.     242.16(b), and,  thus,  not admissible  as<br><br>          evidence at  the hearing.  Simply  asking Davila-Bardales whether<br><br>          the  same  allegations are  accurate,  but  reading  them from  a<br><br>          different  piece of paper, does  not cure the  basic legal defect<br><br>          that mars the initial questioning.<br><br>                    Little  daunted, the  INS  points to  a  third kind  of<br><br>          evidence admitted at the hearing:   the I-213 form itself.   That<br><br>          form purports to memorialize an interview between Davila-Bardales<br><br>          and a  Border  Patrol officer.    According to  petitioner,  this<br><br>          interview took place sometime after midnight at the "frontier" on<br><br>          the  day he entered this  country, before an  official who "spoke<br><br>          little  Spanish," and  who (petitioner  says)  "hit" him  "in the<br><br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          face."<br><br>                    We  agree with  the  INS that  the  regulation we  have<br><br>          quoted  does not explicitly apply  to this evidence.   After all,<br><br>          the regulation,  in context,  seems to  refer to the  immigration<br><br>          hearing   and  the   IJ's   acceptance  of   an  "admission"   of<br><br>          deportability at  that hearing.  It says nothing about admissions<br>                        ________________<br><br>          made  at other times and under other circumstances.  See 8 C.F.R.<br>                                                               ___<br><br>            242.16(b).3<br><br>                    Nonetheless, the  BIA, in  its case law,  has expressed<br><br>          considerable   skepticism  about  the  admissibility  of  similar<br><br>          statements made to Border Patrol officers by persons who are both<br><br>          unrepresented   and  under  the  age  of  sixteen.    By  way  of<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               3The regulation provides in pertinent part:<br><br>                    The special inquiry officer shall require the<br>                    respondent  to plead  to  the order  to  show<br>                    cause by stating whether  he admits or denies<br>                    the factual allegations and his deportability<br>                    under the charges contained therein.   If the<br>                    respondent admits the factual allegations and<br>                    admits  his  deportability under  the charges<br>                    and the special inquiry officer  is satisfied<br>                    that  no issues  of law  or fact  remain, the<br>                    special  inquiry  officer may  determine that<br>                    the   deportability   as  charged   has  been<br>                    established   by   the   admissions  of   the<br>                    respondent.    The  special  inquiry  officer<br>                    shall    not    accept   an    admission   of<br>                    deportability    from    an     unrepresented<br>                    respondent who is incompetent or under age 16<br>                    and   is  not  accompanied   by  a  guardian,<br>                    relative, or  friend . . . .   When, pursuant<br>                    to  this  paragraph,   the  special   inquiry<br>                    officer  may  not  accept  an   admission  of<br>                    deportability, he shall  direct a hearing  on<br>                    the issues.<br><br>          8 C.F.R.   242.16(b).<br><br>                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          illustration, it  has said  the following about  such "statements<br><br>          made to an arresting officer during a custodial interrogation":<br><br>                         On its face,  8 C.F.R.   242.16(b)  does<br>                    not  bar  statements  made  during  custodial<br>                    interrogation.

In adjudicating  Davila-<br><br>          Bardales's status, the  BIA appears  to have blazed  a new  trail<br><br>          that  veers significantly  from its  own  prior precedent.   This<br><br>          zigzag course is  not open to an agency when,  as now, the agency<br><br>          has failed to  explain why it is  changing direction (or  even to<br><br>          acknowledge in the  later decision  that it is  detouring from  a<br><br>          beaten path).  See Shaw's Supermarkets, 884 F.2d at 36.  In light<br>                         ___ ___________________<br><br>          of the unavowed, unexplained deviation, we shall remand this case<br><br>          to the BIA so that it may focus upon the matter and either adhere<br><br>          to its  position in Hernandez-Jimenez  and Garcia, or  relate the<br>                              _________________      ______<br><br>          reasons that make an alteration in that position appropriate.<br><br>                    We  mention  a  few  other  points.    For  one  thing,<br><br>          Hernandez-Jimenez and Garcia apparently are unpublished decisions<br>          _________________     ______<br><br>          and, thus, not  formally in the  category of "selected  decisions<br><br>          designated by the  Board," so they do  not constitute "precedent"<br><br>          in the technical  sense.  See 8 C.F.R.    3.1(g) (1993); see also<br>                                    ___                            ___ ____<br><br>          Leal-Rodriguez  v.

Because the INS has chosen not to rely on this argument,<br><br>          we  will  not  adopt  it as  a  basis  for  sustaining  the BIA's<br><br>          decision.  See, e.g.,  Sandstrom v.

Put  bluntly, we see<br><br>          no  earthly  reason why  the mere  fact of  nonpublication should<br><br>          permit  an agency to take a  view of the law in  one case that is<br><br>          flatly   contrary  to  the  view  it  set  out  in  earlier  (yet<br><br>          contemporary)  cases, without  explaining  why it  is doing  so.4<br><br>          Hence, we do  not believe that  the BIA, in the  circumstances at<br><br>          hand, can  take refuge behind  the determination  not to  publish<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               4In this vein, we note that the  Leal-Rodriguez court, while<br>                                                ______________<br>          stating that  it would  "not  bind the  BIA  with a  single  non-<br>          precedential,  unpublished  decision,"  also  observed  that  the<br>          unpublished   decision  there   at  issue   was  not,   in  fact,<br>          inconsistent with the BIA's  position in the case before  it, and<br>          that,  therefore,   the  unpublished  ruling  "would   not  help"<br>          petitioner even  if it  had precedential value.

See, e.g., 8  C.F.R.   242.17(e)<br>                                           ___  ____<br><br>          (stating  that  an  asylum  application "shall  not  be  held  to<br><br>          constitute a concession of alienage or deportability in any  case<br><br>          in  which  the   respondent  does  not  admit   his  alienage  or<br><br>          deportability").
