signalised and terminated as it was by such terrible
reprisals, it was because he recognised from the very
first that the tri-coloured flag was but a mask for the
imperial banner which followed in the track of the
foreigner, and that the existence of the republic was
menaced in the very first instance. We may well
believe that this unavowed aim was the principal cause
of the disguised support which was furnished by the
United States to the republican cause from the begin-
ning—a support which sufficed to hold in check, and
finally to ruin, the French influence in America. Cer-
tain documents, which were found in General Comon-
fort's baggage, abandoned in the foundry at San
Lorenzo, have come under our observation. They
leave no doubt whatever as to the co-operation of the
United States, and that the latter comprehended that
France desired to profit by the war which was inter-

to the Anglo-Saxon influence.     President Lincoln,
J whose honesty was so praised in France, wrote to
Juarez:—'We are not at open war with France, but
reckon on money, cannon, and voluntary enlistments,
all of which we shall countenance.' He kept his word.
Here, too, one cannot help being painfully impressed
by the vacillations of the imperial government, which
seemed as if it dared not adopt a decided character in
its trans-oceanic policy, and from the commencement
to the conclusion of the expedition resorted to little
else but half-measures. The idea of placing the
Latin race as a bulwark against the encroachments of
the .Anglo-Saxon, who probably half a century hence
»-~*~vn\l embrace the entire globe by joining hands with
the Russians, was certainly an imposing one, and well
worthy to tempt a bold heart and a great nation ; but
only on the condition that the means of its success
