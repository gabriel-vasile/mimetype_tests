102             THE  CHINESE FACTOR
impotence, absence of public spirit, and want of power to do harm.
When Mr. Hay's proposals fell like a bombshell in the diplomatic dovecote, there was a great fluttering among the doves. In view of the previous action of the United States, Russia was suspicious of the motive, while the friends of Japan only saw her deprived of an eventual and valuable coadjutor. There was hesitation and demur. History may say that the initiative of the United States was the most remarkable act of statesmanship of the opening years of the century, and let us hope it may add that it saved the world from one of the gravest dangers on the political horizon. Reflection will surely induce all men of sense to agree that not only was Mr. Hay in the right, but that, in the interests of the world's peace, neutrality should be imposed upon China, even though the ultima ratio has to be resorted to in the process. Neither of the combatants would have any reason to complain, since one would be saved from a danger that is obvious and imminent, and the other from an equal danger, though one superficially less obvious and more remote. China has, indeed, made a declaration of neutrality, which was published in the Peking Gazette on February 12 last; but it is distinctly stated in that document that the enforcement of the rules of neutrality will be impossible in Manchuria, and the reservation may serve to cover designs at present unavowed.

It would be most improper and unfair not to allow Japan full credit for this far-seeing and statesman-like decision. But she can hardly be expected to interpose and fight China, if China plunges recklessly into the struggle on her side; that is too much
