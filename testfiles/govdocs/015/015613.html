At 3:57 a.m. on the morning after Christmas Day
1979, a large area of northern England and southern
Scotland was shaken by an earthquake. In the
mesoseismal area, a few miles north of Carlisle, chimneys
toppled into the streets or fell through roofs, and
people ran in panic into the open. Over a much wider
area, including the densely populated industrial area
of central Scotland, people were awakened, and
ornaments and other small objects were disturbed. At
distances over 120 miles from the epicenter, only a
few people noted the tremor. Northern Ireland and the
Isle of Man also experienced the tremor but reportedly
at no very great intensity. The disturbed area covered
approximately 45,000 square miles.
<p>
Minutes after the earthquake struck, police forces
in the disturbed area were deluged with telephone
calls from the anxious public. Seismologists at the
Institute of Geological Sciences (IGS) were soon at work
making a preliminary analysis of the seismograms
obtained from the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph
Network station Eskdalemuir and from the large
network of seismometers, LOWNET, situated in the
Lowland Valley of central Scotland. It was soon
apparent that the epicenter lay close to four small
shocks that had been detected on LOWNET in early
October 1979. An epicenter location, with fairly small
errors, of about 16 miles was determined for the
December 26 shock at 55.00&deg;N., 2.88&deg;W.
<p>
Assessment of magnitude (M) proved difficult
because the seismograms of both Eskdalemuir and
LOWNET were so close to the epicenter that they
were saturated. It was not until the following day
that the first reliable magnitude measurement of MS=5.0
was made by Robin Adams of the International
Seismological Centre at Newbury in the south of
England using a seismogram recorded there. Shortly
afterwards, the European and Mediterranean
Seismological Centre (CSEM) in Strasbourg, France,
confirmed this value. However, by comparing the felt
area of the December 26 shock with previous strongly
felt British earthquakes of known magnitude, a
magnitude figure of between 4.5 and 5.0 was
estimated.
<p>
By 10 a.m. on December 27, a reasonably detailed
picture of the earthquake had emerged, and this
information was given to the press, radio, and television
networks to help allay people's fears. In turn, the
media responded by giving reports of where the
earthquake was felt. Questionnaires were circulated, and a
form was placed in a number of national and local
newspapers for the public to fill in and return to IGS.
These data will give a detailed picture of the shock's
effects throughout the shaken area.
<p>
As press interest in the earthquake was satisfied,
the task of complementing the preliminary data set
got under way. Magnetic tape recordings from the IGS
stations at Hereford, Leeds, Stoke-on-Trent,
Nottingham, and Leicester were sent to Edinburg for
analysis. Within a few days, station readings and
seismograms from other British stations started to
arrive in Edinburg together with data from other
European stations. Not only the seismograms of the main
shock but also those of the aftershock sequence were
interpreted, and locations and magnitudes for these
events were determined. The strongest of these,
to date, occurred on December 27 at 07 h 23m GMT
(ML=2.0) and 23 h 05 m GMT (ML=2.5) and on
January 1, 1980 (ML=3.5). The latter event was felt
over about 5,000 square miles.
<p>
The last comparable earthquake to occur in Britain
was in 1926 and had an epicenter near Hereford. The
degree of alarm felt by the public for the 1979 earthquake
may thus largely be ascribed to the rarity of
shocks of this magnitude in Britain. A few tremors
had been recorded from the Carlisle area prior to the
December 26 earthquake and were in keeping with the
historic seismic record in northwest England and
southern Scotland. Since 1786, 10 earthquakes are on
record as originating in the Carlisle area, the largest
being M=4.4 (estimated) shock on August 11, 1786.
There is no obvious tectonic feature within the
complex geology of this region that corresponds to the
focal depth of 19 miles for the Carlisle earthquake.
When all the data from this earthquake series are collected
and analyzed, it is hoped that a clearer picture of the
tectonic mechanism may emerge. The macroseismic
data, among other things, will be used to derive an
intensity attenuation law.
<p>
Although an unnerving experience for people
sleeping after their Christmas celebrations, the Carlisle
earthquake will provide British seismologists with a
rare opportunity for a rich field study for some time.
