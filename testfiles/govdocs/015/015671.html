<h4>Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, United States
Department of State</h4></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Thank you very much, Jessica.  Thank you all very much for being
here for this remarkable
gathering of great talents:  Jack Gibbons, who does such a superb
job of reminding us all of
the role and responsibilities of the scientific community Jack,
thank you very much for your
great work; and David Hamburg, who has been a cogent mentor, as
Jessica said, to so many
of us for such a long period of time.
<P>
It is a great pleasure for me to be with you all this morning to
share some thoughts about
several of the issues engaging this country and this
Administration, a set of new, cross-
cutting global issues we are confronting in the context of
profound change for our country
and the world.
<P>
All over the globe, nations are beginning to recognize their
opportunity and responsibility to
look beyond the crisis of the moment toward the underlying causes
that are making the world
ever more complex, and redefining the priorities for long-term
national security and global
stability.
<P>
With the Cold War ever more a distant reflection in the rear-view
mirror, there are those
who would suggest that the United States mission is domestic
only.  They argue that since
our interests and responsibilities around the world are greatly
diminished, we should simply
maintain a strong defense to guard against military threats and
traditional security concerns. 
This view ignores much more than the increasingly interdependent
nature of the world.  It
ignores the tremendous suffering and lost opportunities that
exist in today's world.  It ignores
our responsibility to ensure progress and hope for our children
and for the world of
tomorrow.
<P>
Passive isolation will not enable us to fulfill these
responsibilities.  Instead, the challenges of
the 21st century point us toward sustainable development, toward
the central concept agreed
at the Earth Summit of 1992.  Sustainable development
fundamentally means that the
economies of the world, including our own, should attempt to meet
the needs of today's
generation without compromising or stealing from future
generations.  It is a concept rooted
in the recognition of the mutually reinforcing nature of social,
economic, and environmental
progress.
<P>
Ecological systems are the very foundation of modern society in
agriculture, in social
organization, and in economic planning.  Over the long term,
living off of our ecological
capital is a bankrupt economic strategy.  At the same time, most
peoples and nations aspire
to economic growth and social, scientific, and technological
progress, which, in turn, are the
essential building blocks of environmental protection.
<P>
Understanding these new realities and stresses of economics and
the environment means
coming to grips with some difficult scientific information.  The
issues involved are devilishly
complex, ranging all the way from global warming and rapid
population growth to
biodiversity and international health.  Important for this city
and for public policy is the fact
that with knowledge comes responsibility, and if you do not know
or do not want to know,
you therefore do not have to act.
<P>
Central to these concerns and setting the pace for change all
over the world is the spiral of
population growth.  If every ten years we go on adding a China's
worth of human beings to
the planet, the human population will triple from today's 5.5 to
almost 15 billion by the end
of the next century.  To stand by and let that happen would be to
doom every hope of
economic progress in the developing world and most every
humanitarian endeavor.
<P>
I would suggest that this generation of leadership must embrace
the fact that global threats
are replacing Cold War confrontations as primary challenges and
catalysts for our common
purpose.  At the end of this century we will be measured by how
well we made the
transition, redirected our national efforts, and refocused our
scarce resources.  The
incorporation of global threats into the post-Cold War definition
of American national
security means that we have to break down barriers.  In the words
of Abraham Lincoln,
"...to disenthrall ourselves from old ideas."
<P>
We are accustomed to searching for the causes of international
instability in such factors as
ideology, geopolitics, economic inequity, or intense hatred
spawned by nationalism, race,
and religious fanaticism.  To these we must now add such
heterogeneous factors as soil
erosion, air pollution, overgrazing, fresh water supply, loss of
biodiversity, shortages of
firewood, infectious disease, and many others.
<P>
Compared even with the complex considerations that determined our
national security during
the Cold War, the new global threats to international stability
are bewildering in their
interplay of manmade and natural phenomena.  All of these factors
are linked through a
complex chain of cause and effect, resulting in issues that can
make even the arcane calculus
of nuclear deterrence seem like a simple proposition.  Climate
change calculations, for
example, challenge even the most complex and powerful computers
that were designed for
our Cold War weapons programs.
<P>
Complexity need not be the enemy of a coherent concept for policy
related to global issues. 
The Clinton Administration has emphasized a shift toward
preventive diplomacy,
incorporating support for democracies, sustainable development,
traditional diplomacy, and
military strength, aimed at preventing conflicts before they
happen, addressing underlying
factors that lead to undesirable political and economic
competition, and containing conflicts
that do occur.  These measures are, it seems to us, a wise
investment in our national security
because they offer the prospect of resolving problems with the
least human and material cost.<P>

I want to highlight some of the major components of our
prevention strategy, beginning with
the Administration's vigorous efforts to promote sustainable
development, both at home and
abroad.  Sustainable development is inextricably linked to the
notion of preventing global
threats before they occur.  It requires discipline,
sophistication, and a commitment to long-
term interests.  The indicators of success will not always be
trophies or victories.  They will
often be measures of undesirable events that did not happen.  
<P>
While the indicators are at times elusive, the tools,
particularly as they relate to science and
technology, are clear.  In addition to the traditional analytical
tools of the political, social,
economic and military sciences, decision makers must now
incorporate with increased
frequency the expertise that resides in the realm of the physical
and biological sciences. 
Science and technology are crucial to a safe and sustainable
future.  Indeed, given their
interdependent nature, global issues require rigorous application
of the basic principles of the
scientific method careful, informed and disciplined approaches.
<P>
Science is essential if we are to understand the causes,
characteristics, and consequences of
global problems, and in teasing apart the tangled relationships. 
In many cases, the scientific
course bears great responsibility and opportunity for alerting
the public and governmental
leaders to emerging problems and new understandings of long,
vexing trends.  For example,
scientists warned about the dangers of ozone depletion long
before the ozone hole developed
over the Antarctic and public policy moved dramatically forward.
<P>
Space science allows us to accumulate an invaluable record of the
state and evolution of the
basic components of the biosphere crop lands, forests, grass
lands, oceans, fresh
waterways, and grappling with global climate change.  Newly
emerging infectious diseases
and protecting the world's biodiversity require immense
scientific capabilities.  Precise
measurements and the development of predictive quantitative
models are essential tools for
policy making in the post-Cold War security environment.
<P>
While we are committed to helping ensure that scientists have the
resources they need, we
also recognize the limits of science in some of these areas. 
Rooted as it is in the irreducible
properties of the natural world, science does not and cannot
always provide a simple answer. 
Ranges of uncertainty, which we are accustomed to in economic
policy making, must be
accepted in these new elements of national security policy.  And,
after all, security was
equally apparent during the Cold War, when we did not know
precisely when or if the
Soviets might rush through the Fulda Gap.  We took a
precautionary approach and bought
insurance.
<P>
The parallels with the Cold War do not end here.  As we reach out
to expand the network of
allies in our generational struggle against communism, our new
international agenda must
also include development of appropriate technology for meeting
the needs of countries in the
developing world.  There is a great thirst in these countries for
the enormous economic,
health, and personal benefits that technology can bring.  We know
that it is impossible to
extend overnight the current technological standards of the
industrialized countries to the
entire population of the earth, but we have to continue to
cooperate.
<P>
While rapid technological change is taking place throughout much
of the world, we must be
concerned about countries that are falling further and further
behind, feeding dangerous gaps
between socioeconomic groups and between nations.  Successful
assimilation of the latest
technologies, on the other hand, may help us allow countries to
leap-frog certain investments
and stages of development, leading to less pollution, higher
productivity and, we hope, to
elimination of absolute poverty and some higher incomes.

Because the new threats are global, international science and
technology cooperation is
essential.  Often the research must be done in situ, as in the
case of assessing and preserving
biodiversity.  We also recognize that though we remain a world
leader in science and
technology expertise, some of the best scientific minds can be
found abroad.  Not only does
cooperation strengthen our talent through exposure to new ideas,
but it has built bridges
among nations, often when no other avenues were available.
<P>
Perhaps most important, during these times of severe budgetary
pressure, international
cooperation reduces the cost of scientific endeavor borne by any
one nation and helps to
ensure that scientific results are disseminated and used
worldwide.  The best way to promote
and achieve sustainable practices globally is through
participatory research, development, and
commercial partnerships among developed and developing countries.
<P>
Developing countries
need the opportunity to develop adequate science and technology
infrastructure to incorporate
and utilize sustainable technologies.
<P>
An honest appraisal of these issues must also include
acknowledgment that misuse of science
and technology, whether deliberate or not, and the unanticipated
consequences of
technological development, are often among the causes of
environmental stress and potential
global dangers.  It is ironic that many of the marvels of our
scientific age could in fact
imperil future generations.
<P>
Advances in medical equipment and procedures that prolong life
spans, development of
pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation systems, constructions of
dams and roads, introduction of
enormous oil tankers and logging equipment, and fish-processing
ships, wide-scale use of
gaseous refrigerants and aerosol propellants, nonrenewable energy
generation schemes, and
the ubiquitous automobile, not to mention the dazzling
sophistication of modern
weaponry all of these technologies can generate stress that
contributes to some degree of
global instability.
<P>
We should have learned an important lesson.  Our stewardship of
the earth implies a
responsibility to be stewards of manmade technology as well.  We
must routinely investigate
and evaluate the economic, social, and environmental costs of the
technologies that we
propose to use on a broad scale.  We must also accept that the
public's attitude toward
science and technology and support for federal research and
development expenditures is
often undermined by a perception of unexpected difficulties and
unfulfilled promises.
<P>
No doubt our efforts to anticipate and wisely direct the course
of science and technology will
only be partially successful.  When the transistor was first
developed during the late 1940s,
no one could have predicted the full impact of the technology
that would follow through
application of this century's perhaps most important invention. 
Similar surprises are in store
for us and for future generations.  Still, our legacy to those
generations must include our
utmost efforts to use our skill and knowledge in a responsible
and beneficial way.
<P>
I would like to close by highlighting just one example of the
tremendous importance and
promise of these new challenges.  I am increasingly convinced
that the biodiversity issue may
dwarf all others in the not-distant future.  The 21st century
will certainly be the century of
biology.  Compounds of undiscovered promise await us.  Already
more than 50 percent of
today's top-selling pharmaceuticals come directly from plant
biochemicals.  I need not
remind this distinguished audience of such a list:  Periwinkle,
foxglove, quinine,
penicillin the list goes on and on, providing immeasurable
assistance and comfort to
mankind and creating multibillion dollar markets, which are
overwhelmingly American.
<P>
Similarly, our food base comes from the reservoir of nature. 
Just three species of
grass rice, wheat, and corn have become humanity's principal
food, and as with plants
possessing medical potential, we have barely begun to understand
the abundance of the
natural world.  We can measure the distance to the moon to an
accuracy of centimeters, but
have not explored the wonder of our own world species.  Are there
10 million?  Fifty
million?  A hundred million?  What genetic wonders do they hold? 
Certainly this is the
overwhelmingly important frontier of the future in which we can
prospect for food, fuel,
pharmaceuticals and fiber as we once prospected for gold and
silver in our own back yard.  
<P>
Yet, there are forces afoot in our country bent upon crippling
our own nation's biological
survey, repealing the Endangered Species Act, ignoring the
International Biodiversity Treaty. 
One of the major challenges that we face is to change the terms
of the biological debate so
that it does not take the form of oppressive government
regulation, but rather is understood
as a phenomenal future dominated by United States scientific,
pharmaceutical,
biotechnological, agricultural advances.  Here, too, we can prove
that economic prosperity
and environmental preservation can be linked with enormous
promise for posterity.
<P>
In what is left of this century we together have the
responsibility to change much of the way
that the world does its business so that the earth, as we know it
and love it, can survive in
the century to come.  The partnership between the Administration
and the scientific
community is crucial in reaching this mission.  That is why we
are all here today and
tomorrow, and we deeply appreciate your coming.  Thank you ever
so much.</p>
