    <h1>The State of The Union Address, A Tradition Since 1790</h1>







  <p>Required By The Constitution</p><p>By David Pitts<br />Washington File Staff Writer</p><p>Washington -- On January 29, President George W. Bush is scheduled to<br />deliver his State of the Union address to Congress and to the American<br />people and the world. In view of the events of September 11, and the<br />resulting war against terrorism, this year's speech may be among the<br />more memorable ever delivered.<br /><br />The State of the Union is one of only a few presidential speeches that<br />are televised live in prime time on all major U.S. networks. This has<br />elevated its prominence enormously compared to earlier times. For over<br />a hundred years, it wasn't even delivered in person by the president.<br />Instead, it was sent to Congress as a written message.<br /><br />The tradition goes back to 1790 when George Washington, the first<br />president of the United States, delivered his &quot;Annual Message,&quot; as it<br />was known then, as required by the Constitution. Article II, Section<br />III states that the president shall &quot;from time to time give to the<br />Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their<br />consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and<br />expedient.&quot; These &quot;innocuous phrases conferred on the American<br />president what has become, after vicissitudes, a basic tool in his<br />management of Congress and a potent instrument of national<br />leadership,&quot; writes the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in his book,<br />&quot;The State of the Union Messages of the Presidents.&quot;<br /><br />Washington and his successor, John Adams, delivered addresses in<br />person surrounded by much pomp and ceremony, as was the custom under<br />the rule of the English kings before independence. But the nation's<br />third president, Thomas Jefferson, felt that such elaborate displays<br />ill befit the new democratic republic. He derided the practice as a<br />&quot;speech from the throne,&quot; and instead delivered a written message<br />rather than appearing in person. Jefferson's influence was such that<br />for more than a century thereafter, the Annual Message would be<br />written and sent to Congress rather than delivered in person.<br /><br />In the early decades, most State of the Union messages were laundry<br />lists of bills the president wanted the Congress to enact -- often<br />reflective of the tenor of the times and the practical problems<br />involved in building the young American nation. Until the Civil War<br />(1861-65), the speeches also often dealt with internal threats to the<br />union, reflecting a major concern of the Founding Fathers. During this<br />time, the annual reports &quot;were, understandably, preoccupied with how<br />tenuous were the ties of national union,&quot; writes Wayne Fields in his<br />book, &quot;Union of Words: A History of Presidential Eloquence.&quot;<br /><br />In addition, the speeches also dealt with the international situation<br />and America's place in the world, not least in this hemisphere. A<br />prime example is President James Monroe's Annual Message to Congress<br />in 1823 opposing European intervention in the Americas. Speaking<br />directly to the European powers of the day, Monroe wrote, &quot;We owe it,<br />therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between<br />the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider<br />any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of<br />this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.&quot; In the decades<br />that followed, the Monroe Doctrine often would be invoked by<br />presidents to indicate America's determination to keep this hemisphere<br />master of its own destiny.<br /><br />In particularly turbulent periods, some presidents used the State of<br />the Union as a vehicle to express their view of great issues then at<br />stake and their vision of the road ahead - speaking not just to<br />lawmakers but to their fellow citizens, to the world at large, and, in<br />some instances, to the ages. During the crisis that, more than any<br />other, threatened the very existence of the American union -- the<br />Civil War -- President Abraham Lincoln wrote perhaps the most eloquent<br />and memorable of all presidential messages sent to Congress.<br /><br />When the speech was delivered on December 1, 1862, it was clear that<br />the state of the union was not good, the outcome of the war still<br />uncertain, the defeat of the Confederate rebellion by no means a<br />foregone conclusion. But Lincoln rose to the occasion.<br />Characteristically, his words went to the heart of the struggle then<br />engulfing the nation -- framing for all Americans, and for the world,<br />the essential choice to be made.<br /><br />&quot;The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present,&quot;<br />he wrote. &quot;The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise<br />to the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act<br />anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our<br />country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this<br />Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of<br />ourselves.&quot; He added: &quot;In giving freedom to the slave, we assure<br />freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give and what we<br />preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of<br />earth. Other means may succeed. This could not fail. The way is plain,<br />peaceful, generous, just -- a way which if followed the world will<br />forever applaud and God must forever bless.&quot; It was, wrote historian<br />Arthur Schlesinger, &quot;the highest eloquence of all Annual Messages ...<br />profound and beautiful.&quot;<br /><br />In 1913, Woodrow Wilson revived the practice of delivering the Annual<br />Message in person that had been pioneered by Washington and Adams more<br />than a century earlier. &quot;A president is likely to read his own message<br />rather better than a clerk would,&quot; he quipped. The two-term president,<br />famous for championing the League of Nations, the precursor<br />organization to the United Nations, used the occasion to deliver a<br />wide-ranging speech, mostly centered on domestic policy. Wilson's<br />decision to appear in person was prescient. The United States was on<br />the eve of an electronic mass media revolution that would soon bring<br />presidents into the homes of Americans via radio, and, after World War<br />II, via television. Although Wilson's words were not heard by most<br />Americans, his moving image became familiar to them through silent<br />newsreels.<br /><br />With the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) as president in<br />1932, Americans would become accustomed to hearing their presidents on<br />radio as well as seeing them -- and now hearing them -- on the<br />newsreels at the movies. One of his most enduring speeches was the<br />Annual Message he delivered in 1941. With war raging across Europe, he<br />set forth his famous Four Freedoms.<br /><br />&quot;In the future days,&quot; he said, &quot;which we seek to make secure, we look<br />forward to a world founded upon four essential freedoms. The first is<br />freedom of speech and expression, everywhere in the world. The second<br />is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way, everywhere<br />in the world. The third is freedom from want ... everywhere in the<br />world. The fourth is freedom from fear...anywhere in the world.&quot; Later<br />that year, after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, Roosevelt<br />addressed a special joint session of Congress to ask for a declaration<br />of war against Japan.<br /><br />In 1945, the Annual Message formally became known as the State of the<br />Union address. It also was about to become a television as well as<br />radio staple as sales of television sets skyrocketed in the years<br />after World War II. In recognition of the power of television to<br />deliver the president's words to a huge audience, President Lyndon<br />Johnson shifted the time of the address from the traditional midday to<br />evening when more viewers would be watching.<br /><br />&quot;And now, in 1965, we begin a new quest for union,&quot; Johnson said in<br />his first State of the Union address that year. He detailed an<br />expansive vision of a &quot;Great Society,&quot; in which poverty would be<br />eliminated and the civil rights of all Americans would be protected.<br />Although his reports are not considered eloquent by most historians,<br />they are reflective of Johnson's sweeping agenda and the liberal ethos<br />then dominant in American society. His speeches were heir to a<br />generation of progressivism in American life - from Roosevelt's New<br />Deal beginning in the early 1930s to John F. Kennedy's New Frontier of<br />the early 1960s.<br /><br />A very different direction was charted by Ronald Reagan in his first<br />State of the Union address delivered in 1982. Reagan used the occasion<br />to detail an unambiguous, conservative agenda not only in domestic<br />affairs, but also foreign policy. &quot;Together, after 50 years of taking<br />power away from the hands of the people in their states and local<br />communities,&quot; he said, &quot;we have started returning power and resources<br />to them.&quot; Reagan articulated a new interpretation of limited, federal<br />power in the U.S. system of government, the influence of which was<br />enduring. Even Bill Clinton, a president with very different views to<br />those of Reagan, famously said in one of his state of the unions, &quot;the<br />era of big government is over.&quot;<br /><br />Although Reagan devoted most of his remarks to domestic policy in his<br />1982 speech, he did not neglect relations overseas, particularly with<br />the Soviet Union. &quot;In the last decade,&quot; he said, &quot;while we sought the<br />moderation of Soviet power through a policy of restraint and<br />accommodation, the Soviets engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their<br />military forces. The protection of our national security has required<br />that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military<br />forces.&quot; He added: &quot;A recognition of what the Soviet empire is about<br />is the starting point.&quot;<br /><br />The broadcast of the State of the Union address on television,<br />particularly when it was moved to prime time, has changed the<br />fundamental nature of the message, according to political observers.<br />&quot;As the audience has changed from inside the (Washington) Beltway to<br />outside,&quot; says Paul C. Light, a prominent political scientist with the<br />Brookings Institution, &quot;the State of the Union has changed from a<br />sometimes windy policy address to a major campaign event,&quot; one, it<br />might be added, in which the primary audience is now the American<br />voter, and the wider audience overseas, rather than the American<br />lawmaker.<br /><br />This will certainly be true when President George W. Bush delivers his<br />State of the Union address on January 29. Both domestic and overseas<br />observers will be looking to the president for an indication of how<br />the events of September 11 have reshaped the U.S. domestic and foreign<br />policy agenda.<br /></p><p />
