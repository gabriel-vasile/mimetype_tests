                            <p> Session VI</p>

       <p><strong>Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion</strong></p>

                        <p>by John Kenneth White<br />

                      Department of Politics, Catholic University of America<br />

                         Washington, D.C.</p> 

 

                           <p><strong> Introduction </strong></p>

         <p> Life is lived forward, but understood backward. <br />

                         <em>Soren Kierkegaard</em>  </p>

<p>     September 1968.  The presidential race had begun in earnest.  The major party 

nominees, Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey and Republican Richard M. Nixon, were energetically 

making their appeals for public support.  But behind closed doors another &quot;campaign&quot; was 

taking place. The power brokers in the Kremlin were taking their measure of the candidates, 

trying to determine which one could best manage the superpower relationship.  It was a 

difficult decision. Only a month before the Soviet Union had invaded Czechoslovakia, ending 

Alexander Dubcek's brief experiment with &quot;socialism with a human face.&quot;  After Dubcek's 

ouster, Communist party chief Leonid Brezhnev enunciated the &quot;Brezhnev Doctrine,&quot; the guise 

under which the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could correct its fraternal neighbors by 

military invasion whenever they deviated from Moscow's hard-line.  Both the Czech invasion and 

the Brezhnev Doctrine met with widespread condemnation.  Oleg Kalugin, the KGB station chief 

in Washington, D.C., found his informants were keeping mum.  Instead of recruiting spies 

through ideological solidarity, large sums of cold hard cash were needed to lure greedy 

Americans into snooping for Moscow--as it was later disclosed in the spy cases involving John 

Walker and Aldrich Ames.  In his view, American-Soviet relations were at an impasse and 

something &quot;drastic&quot; was required to break the <a name="01"></a>deadlock.

<a href="#1"><sup>Note 1</sup></a></p>

 

<p>     That drastic step was electing Richard Nixon president.  While Kalugin thought Nixon

&quot;unpredictable,&quot; he also believed that Nixon's long-time anti-communism might be the needed

catalyst &quot;to improve relations between our countries, for no one would ever dare accuse Nixon 

of being soft on <a name="02"></a>communism.<a href="#2"><sup>Note 2</sup></a>&quot;  Cloaked with 

a veil of secrecy, Kalugin and his KGB colleagues spun a web of intrigue.  They established a 

back-channel to the Nixon campaign, using HarvardUniversity professor Henry Kissinger as an 

intermediary.  Through a series of letters addressed to Kissinger, Nixon was informed that 

Brezhnev and the KGB would welcome his election.</p>

<p>     But Kalugin did not speak for a unified Soviet leadership.  The Soviet ambassador to 

the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, already had done some politicking on his own.  Believing 

that Hubert Humphrey would never initiate World War III and fearing Nixon was too staunch an

anti-communist (and a scoundrel besides), Dobrynin told Humphrey that the decision-makers in

the Politburo looked favorably upon him and he offered to help the cash-starved Democratic

campaign.  Humphrey refused, saying it was &quot;more than enough for him to have Moscow's good

<a name="03"></a>wishes.<a href="#3"><sup>Note 3</sup></a>&quot;  After the ballots were counted 

and Nixon finished a hair's breadth ahead of Humphrey, the Kremlin sent a secret missive via 

Kissinger congratulating Nixon.  Remembering the pro-Humphrey views of the Soviet ambassador, 

the KGB never told him about the letter.  Days later an &quot;official&quot; communique from the Soviet 

embassy offered Moscow's best wishes to the <a name="04"></a>president-elect.

<a href="#4"><sup>Note 4</sup></a></p>

<p>     The point of this story is not to argue that these behind-the-scene actions affected 

the outcome of the 1968 contest.  The Vietnam War and public disillusionment with Lyndon  

Johnson took care of that.  Rather, it is to assert that with the end of the Cold War the 

scales have been removed from our eyes.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, we have 

been learning much about what transpired on both sides of the Iron Curtain.  For example, a 

recent search of the Soviet archives produced a 1987 plea from U.S. Communist Party chief 

Gus Hall to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev:  &quot;I don't like to raise the question of 

finances, but when the wolf' is at the door, one is forced to cry <a name="05"></a>out.

<a href="#5"><sup>Note 5</sup></a>&quot;  Gorbachev ordered KGB couriers to stuff their suitcases 

with $2 million in cash. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, Americans learned in 1994 

that thousands of their fellow citizens had been treated as human guinea pigs during the Cold 

War by their own government.  Milton Stadt, the son of one of these unwitting subjects, 

described how his mother had been hospitalized for a duodenal ulcer and found herself in a 

U.S. government-sponsored lab where, he claimed, &quot;these monsters were.&quot;  He remembered: &quot;My 

mother, Jan Stadt, had a number HP-8.  She was injected with plutonium on March 9, 1946.  She 

was forty-one years old, and I was eleven years old at the time.  My mother and father were 

never told or asked for any kind of consent to have this done to <a name="06"></a>them.

<a href="#6"><sup>Note 6</sup></a>&quot;  Jan Stadt subsequently died from the &quot;non-therapeutic&quot; 

radiation experiments performed upon her.</p>

 

<p>     Reflecting on the Cold War years later, schoolteacher John Driscoll recalled:  &quot;It 

seems surreal now.  Every summer, when I heard [sic] heat lightning over the city and the sky 

would light up, I was convinced that it was all over.  My whole childhood was built on the 

notion the Soviets were the real <a name="07"></a>threat.<a href="#7"><sup>Note 7</sup></a>&quot;  

Like John Driscoll, I, too, am a baby-boomer.  Born on October 10, 1952, the Cold War shaped 

my childhood and spanned most of my adult life, as the front-page headlines from the New York 

Times on that day illustrate:  &quot;South Korean Unit, Bayoneting Reds, Regains Key Peak&quot;; &quot;Work 

Completed on U.N. Buildings&quot;; &quot;Stevenson Taunts Rival for Backing McCarthy, Dirksen&quot;; and 

&quot;U.S. to Give France $525,000,000 in Aid and Hints at <a name="08"></a>More.

<a href="#8"><sup>Note 8</sup></a>&quot;  Like so many of my generation, I accepted the Cold War as 

a fact of life.  But the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the cascade of 

events that resulted in the demise of the Soviet Union two years later caught nearly everyone 

unawares.  For example, a June 1989 poll found two-thirds disagreed with the proposition that 

&quot;communism is dying <a name="09"></a>out.<a href="#9"><sup>Note 9</sup></a>&quot;  

But Soviet-style communism did die--except in China, Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea--and with 

it expired the political order and public attitudes that were profoundly influenced and shaped 

by the Cold War.</p>

   <p><strong> The Structure of American Public Opinion During the Cold War</strong> </p>

<p>     In 1949, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., wrote of the Cold War:  &quot;In its essence this 

crisis is <a name="010"></a>internal.<a href="#10"><sup>Note 10</sup></a>&quot;  Although 

Schlesinger believed that the external communist threat was real, he believed that its real 

danger was the fear it engendered in the minds of most Americans. Schlesinger proved 

prescient, as and the resultant politics of fear prompted many to contrast their own 

ideological thinking with communism.  As Richard Nixon once observed, &quot;People respond more to 

fear than love.  They don't teach you that in Sunday school, but it's <a name="011"></a>true.&quot;

<a href="#11"><sup>Note 11</sup></a></p>

<p>     Fear is a powerful political weapon, especially in such a highly ideological nation as 

the United States.  Political Scientist Louis Hartz once hypothesized that Americans were so

ideologically straight-jacketed that a philosophy that did not espouse individualism, equality 

of opportunity, and freedom would be seen as <a name="012"></a>alien.

<a href="#12"><sup>Note 12</sup></a>  Alexis de Tocqueville held a similar view, writing in 

Democracy in America (1835):  &quot;I know of no country in which there is so little independence 

of mind and real freedom of discussion as in <a name="013"></a>America.&quot;

<a href="#13"><sup>Note 13</sup></a>  In 1848, Lewis Cass, the 

Democratic nominee for president, told a Tammany Hall audience that he was &quot;opposed to all the 

isms of the day. . .to communism and socialism, and Mormonism; to polygamy and concubinage, 

and to all the humbugs that are now rising among <a name="014"></a>us.&quot;

<a href="#14"><sup>Note 14</sup></a></p>

<p>     As the decades passed and with no end of the Cold War in sight, communism became the

antithesis to the American creed.  In 1964, the World Book Encyclopedia drew a bright line

between communism and American-style democracy:  &quot;In a democratic country, the government

rules by consent of the people.  In a communist country, the dictator rules by force and stays 

in power by force.  A democratic government tries to act in a way that will benefit the 

people. . .Under communism, the interests of the government always come first. . . .Communism 

violently opposes democracy and the democratic way of <a name="015"></a>life.&quot;

<a href="#15"><sup>Note 15</sup></a>  These views were shared by the vast majority of 

Americans.  According to a 1983 survey, 92 percent said that in a communist country &quot;you only 

hear news the government wants you to hear&quot;; 91 percent agreed that &quot;if you speak your mind, 

you risk going to jail&quot;; 84 percent rejected the notion that life for the average communist 

&quot;is pretty much the same as in the United States&quot;; 80 percent said &quot;you can't move or relocate 

without permission from the government&quot;; 75 percent maintained that &quot;you always have to be 

afraid of the police&quot;; 75 percent agreed that &quot;you can't pick your own job or change jobs&quot;; 69 

percent believed &quot;there is no freedom of religion&quot;; 65 percent disagreed that &quot;there's less 

stress and tension&quot; for the &quot;average&quot; communist; 61 percent said &quot;you can't get a fair trial&quot;; 

60 percent rejected the idea that &quot;men and women are treated <a name="016"></a>equally.&quot;

<a href="#16"><sup>Note 16</sup></a>  Thus, when Ronald Reagan dubbed the Soviet Union the 

&quot;evil empire,&quot; most Americans (and many Russians) agreed with <a name="017"></a>him.

<a href="#17"><sup>Note 17</sup></a></p>

           <p> <strong>The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research</strong> </p>

<p>     Given the preceding discussion, it is no surprise that American hostility toward

communism was an enduring feature of the Cold War.  Public opinion polling from the 1930s 

until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 documents the public antipathy toward communism, even 

as the Cold War alternatively waxed hot and cold.  The Roper Center for Public Opinion 

Research, located on the campus at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, was the place 

where I went to find much of the data that formed Still Seeing <a name="018"></a>Red.

<a href="#18"><sup>Note 18</sup></a>  Founded in 1947, the Roper Center holds the world's 

largest archive of survey data.  Polling organizations, both public and private, regularly 

contribute to the Center's archive.  These organizations include ABC News, Associated Press, 

CBS News, Cambridge Reports, CNN, the Daniel Yankelovich Group, the Gallup Organization, 

Gordon S. Black and Associates (a Republican-oriented polling firm), Greenberg Research (a 

Democratic firm that initially served as President Clinton's polltaker), Louis Harris and 

Associates, Peter D. Hart Research Associates (a long-standing Democratic firm that did the 

polling for Walter Mondale in 1984), The Los Angeles Times, Luntz Research Companies (a 

Republican-based firm that has done polling for Newt Gingrich), Marttila and Kiley (a 

Democratic firm), Mellman and Lazarus (a Democratic firm), NBC News, National Opinion Research 

Center, Newsweek, The New York Times, Opinion Research Corporation, Penn and Schoen (a 

Democratic firm), The Pew Center for the People and the Press, Public Opinion Strategies, 

Roper Starch Worldwide, Scripps-Howard News Service, The Tarrance Group (a Republican firm), 

Time, USA Today, U.S. News and World Report, Voter Research and Surveys (a multi-media effort 

that conducts election day exit polls), The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Wirthlin 

Worldwide (Richard Wirthlin was the poll-taker for President Reagan), and Zogby Group 

International (a Republican-based firm).</p>

<p>     These and other polls have been integrated into POLL, an online source for public 

opinion information.  The POLL database is a question-level retrieval system that permits 

direct access to the Roper Center's holdings.  Containing more than 250,000 questions asked in 

the United States from 1936 to the present, POLL offers complete question-wordings and full 

survey-level citation, such as the organizations conducting and sponsoring the work, interview 

dates, and sample sizes. Access to questions can be obtained by key subject areas or by using 

key words and phrases.  In 1995, POLL integrated a new cross-tab dimension to the existing 

system.  Today more than 40,000 questions from selected surveys conducted since 1990 are 

available with complete major subgroup breakdowns (e.g., gender, race, age, education, income, 

region, political party preference and political ideology).</p>

     

<p>     For Still Seeing Red, I wanted to see all questions that pertained to &quot;communism&quot; or

&quot;communist(s)&quot;, &quot;Russia&quot;, &quot;Russian,&quot; &quot;Soviet,&quot; or &quot;Soviet Union,&quot; and &quot;communism and

Russia&quot;or various combinations of the words cited above.  The number of questions by decade is

reflected in Table 1.</p>

     <p><strong>A Sampling of Early Public Opinion Polling on Communism</strong></p>

<p>     Table 2 is a sampling of some of the earliest soundings of American anti-communism 

from 1937-1949.  As these results suggest, polltakers quickly found a unanimity of opinion 

about communism: it was bad--so bad that sometimes Americans were willing to sacrifice sacred

principles in order to retain ideological solidarity against an &quot;unseen&quot;enemy at home.  This

consensus persisted even while Americans and Russians fought side-by-side against Adolf Hitler

and Nazism during World War II.</p>

<p>     The public hatred of anything that smacked of being labeled communist persisted during

the 1950s.  When the Korean War erupted in 1950, Americans were so hostile toward

communism that they were willing to put their fellow citizens who might belong to the U.S.

Communist party into interment camps if necessary.  As Table 3 shows, a mere one percent stood

firm by the Bill of Rights guaranteed under the Constitution.</p>

<p>Source: Gallup poll, July 30-August 4, 1950.  Text of question: &quot;What do you think should 

be done about members of the Communist Party in the United States in the event we get into a 

war with Russia?&quot;</p>

<p>*Note: Percentages total more than 100 because some respondents gave more than one 

answer.</p>

<p>     Even as late as the 1980s when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed a new era

of glasnost, Americans applauded even as they continued to blame communism for many of their

country's problems.  A 1989 Gallup poll found 52 percent held the communists responsible &quot;for 

a lot of the unrest in the United States <a name="019"></a>today.&quot;

<a href="#19"><sup>Note 19</sup></a>  Of course, the power of the U.S. Communist Party was 

never evidenced in massive numbers of proletarians rising in protest against capitalists. 

Rather, the fear of communism was mostly in our collective consciousness.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Gallup Data, 1936-1991</strong></p>

 <p>    The Gallup polling data illustrates the consistency of public thinking on the subject 

of communism and provides an interesting case study.  Gallup is selected because it is one of 

the oldest public opinion research firms in the United States.  The first question Gallup 

asked on the subject was on April 4, 1936:  &quot;Should schools teach the facts about communism 

and socialism?&quot; The results were yes, teach the facts, 62 percent; no, don't teach the facts, 

38 <a name="020"></a>percent.<a href="#20"><sup>Note 20</sup></a>  During the 1930s, many of 

the questions asked about communism had to do with the Dies Committee (a precursor to the 

House Committee on Un-American Activities).  In 1939, 83 percent had heard or read about the 

Dies <a name="021"></a>Committee.<a href="#21"><sup>Note 21</sup></a>  Of these, 52 percent 

thought it was more important for the committee to investigate communist activities in this 

country; only 25 percent wanted it to investigate Nazi activities in the <a name="022"></a>U.S.

<a href="#22"><sup>Note 22</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><em>The 1940s</em></strong></p>

<p>     In the 1940s, questions about communism in the Gallup polls revolved around the

following issues:</p>

<ol type="square">

 <li>(1) Should members of the U.S. Communist Party have &quot;equal time&quot; on the radio or be

     permitted to obtain government employment?<br />

	 <br /></li>

 <li>(2) What were the suspected ties between communists and union leaders and the

     willingness of both to perpetuate crippling labor strikes?<br />

	 <br /></li>

 <li>(3) Do members of the U.S. Communist Party exhibit greater loyalty to their native

     country or to Moscow?<br />

	 <br />
</li>
 <li>(4) What should be done about members of the U.S. Communist Party in this 

     country--especially whether or not Congress should require members of the U.S. Communist

     Party to register with the Justice Department?<br />

	 <br /></li>

 <li>(5) How did the House Committee on Un-American Activities conduct itself with regard

     to the so-called &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;?<br />

	 <br />
</li>
 <li>(6) What should the United States do about Mao Zedong's communist takeover in China

     and could such a takeover have been prevented?</li>

</ol>

<p>     A sampling of public opinion in each of these six areas reveals a remarkable degree of

consistency.  For example, two-thirds of Americans opposed allowing communists equal time on

the radio.  A typical result was obtained to this September 1940 question: &quot;Should Communist

party candidates be allowed the same amount of free time on the radio as the Democratic and

Republican candidates?&quot;  Yes, 22 percent; no, 67 percent; no opinion, 11 

<a name="023"></a>percent. <a href="#23"><sup>Note 23</sup></a>  A July 1946 poll found 69 

percent opposed to any member of the U.S. Communist Party, or anyone professing to be a 

communist, holding a civil service <a name="024"></a>job.<a href="#24"><sup>Note 24</sup></a> 

A March 1949 survey found 87 percent stating that all communists should be immediately removed 

from industries that would be vital to any wartime <a name="025"></a>effort.

<a href="#25"><sup>Note 25</sup></a>  Americans applied a similar standard to the academic 

community.  A July 1949 poll asked the following: &quot;The University of California recently said 

it would require all its teachers to take an oath that they are not communists.  Some other 

colleges oppose this idea because they feel it is an insult to teachers to require 

them to take such an oath.  How do you, yourself, feel about this?&quot;  Seventy-two percent 

agreed with the oath, just 22 percent were opposed, and 6 percent had no 

<a name="026"></a>opinion. <a href="#26"><sup>Note 26</sup></a></p>

<p>     Americans also saw a close connection between labor unrest and the communists.  An

April 1941 Gallup poll found 78 percent stating that &quot;communists in unions are responsible for 

the strikes in defense <a name="027"></a>industries&quot;<a href="#27"><sup>Note 27</sup></a> and 

an October 1941 Gallup poll reported that 61 percent of the respondents believed that labor 

union leaders were <a name="028"></a>communists.<a href="#28"><sup>Note 28</sup></a>  Not 

surprisingly, a January 1949 found 82 percent opposed to the idea of changing the Taft-Hartley 

Act which required officers of labor unions to swear that they are not communists before they 

can plead their case before the National Labor Relations <a name="029"></a>Board.

<a href="#29"><sup>Note 29</sup></a></p>

<p>     As in the 1930s, Americans harbored strong doubts about the loyalties of members of 

the U.S. Communist Party.  A July 1946 poll found 48 percent saying that members of the U.S.

Communist Party placed their first allegiances to Russia, 23 percent thought they were loyal 

U.S. citizens, and 29 percent had no <a name="030"></a>opinion.

<a href="#30"><sup>Note 30</sup></a>  

However, with the fall of Eastern Europe and China to communism and the emergence of the Alger 

Hiss Case, opinion on this subject hardened. An April 1947 poll found 61 percent stating that 

American communists were loyal to Russia first, 18 percent thought they remained loyal to 

America, and 21 percent had no <a name="031"></a>opinion.<a href="#31"><sup>Note 31</sup></a>  

An October 1947 survey found 62 percent agreeing with the statement: &quot;Communists in this 

country actually take orders from <a name="032"></a>Moscow.&quot;

<a href="#32"><sup>Note 32</sup></a>  An August 1948 poll found 73 percent stating that 

communists in this country &quot;would work against the United States if we should get into a war 

against <a name="033"></a>Russia.&quot;<a href="#33"><sup>Note 33</sup></a></p>

<p>     During the 1940s, Americans continued to hold harsh opinions about what, if anything,

should be done with communists in this country.  An April 1941 Gallup poll found 64 percent

saying that &quot;repressive measures&quot; should be used; 5 percent wanted them placed in prison; just 

8 percent said &quot;do <a name="034"></a>nothing.&quot;<a href="#34"><sup>Note 34</sup></a>  A June 

1946 survey evoked even harsher responses: 36 percent said &quot;kill or imprison them&quot;, 16 percent 

wanted to &quot;curb them or make them inactive&quot;, 7 percent said &quot;do nothing&quot;, and 25 percent had 

no <a name="035"></a>opinion.<a href="#35"><sup>Note 35</sup></a>  Two years later Gallup 

asked another open-ended question about what should be done with American communists.  This 

time the answers were &quot;nothing, this is a democracy,&quot; 8 percent; &quot;should not be encouraged, 

should be taught differently,&quot; 3 percent; &quot;let them rave, but watch them,&quot; 1 percent; &quot;curb 

them,&quot; 14 percent; &quot;keep them out of the offices of government,&quot; 3 percent; &quot;try to get rid of 

them,&quot; 12 percent; &quot;deport them,&quot; 22 percent; &quot;shoot them, hang them,&quot; 4 percent; &quot;jail them,&quot; 

3 percent; &quot;outlaw them, take away their rights,&quot; 8 percent; &quot;miscellaneous,&quot; 5 percent; 

&quot;don't know, no answer,&quot; 16 <a name="036"></a>percent.<a href="#36"><sup>Note 36</sup></a></p>

 

<p>     The actions of the House Committee on Un-American Activities remained controversial

throughout the 1940s.  A November 1947 Gallup poll found nearly 80 percent had heard or read

about the committee's investigations of suspected communists in <a name="037"></a>Hollywood.

<a href="#37"><sup>Note 37</sup></a>  But opinion was evenly split about the committee's 

handling of the issue: 37 percent approved, 36 percent disapproved, and 27 percent had no 

<a name="038"></a>opinion.<a href="#38"><sup>Note 38</sup></a> Still, 47 percent of Americans 

did believe that those Hollywood writers (the so-called &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;) who refused to say 

whether they were members of the U.S. Communist Party should be punished; 39 percent favored 

no sanction; and 14 percent had no <a name="039"></a>opinion.

<a href="#39"><sup>Note 39</sup></a>  In 1949, 55 percent stated that the chief argument for 

continuation of the Un-American Activities Committee was &quot;to expose communism, keep bad 

elements out of government&quot;; &quot;has done a good job so far,&quot; 8 percent; &quot;no good arguments,&quot; 13 

percent; &quot;miscellaneous,&quot; 3 percent; &quot;no opinion,&quot; 22 <a name="040"></a>percent.

<a href="#40"><sup>Note 40</sup></a>  Sixty-four percent wanted 

the committee to continue its work; only 17 percent favored its <a name="041"></a>abolition.

<a href="#41"><sup>Note 41</sup></a></p>

<p>     The advent of the Chinese Revolution in 1949 worried many Americans, even as they

believed that there was little the United States could do to stop <a name="042"></a>it.

<a href="#42"><sup>Note 42</sup></a>  Forty-six percent wanted trade with China discontinued 

if the communists seized power, and 55 percent opposed recognizing the Mao Zedong 

<a name="043"></a>government. <a href="#43"><sup>Note 43</sup></a>

Although Americans were hostile to the new communist regime in China, they believed that the 

Truman administration had few options to prevent Mao's rule.  When asked in August 1949 what 

the U.S. should do to stop China from turning red, 8 percent said &quot;send aid in general,&quot; 7 

percent favored sending military aid, 4 percent wanted economic aid, 2 percent said &quot;use 

propaganda&quot;, and 36 percent replied that there was nothing the U.S. could 

<a name="044"></a>do.<a href="#44"><sup>Note 44</sup></a></p>

<p><em><strong>The 1950s</strong></em></p>

<p>     During the 1950s, the Gallup Organization responded to new issues and personalities as

they related to the ongoing superpower struggle.  Joseph McCarthy entered the public opinion

polls for the first time, and won initial approval.  Fifty percent agreed with McCarthy in a 

March 1950 survey that there were communists working in the State 

<a name="045"></a>Department.<a href="#45"><sup>Note 45</sup></a>  A June 1950 poll found 45 

percent expressed unqualified approval of McCarthy saying &quot;he is anxious to rid us of 

communists and he is right&quot;; 16 percent expressed qualified approval with remarks such as 

&quot;there must be some foundation for his charges, but they are greatly exaggerated&quot;; 31 percent 

disbelieved McCarthy saying he is &quot;a rabble-rouser seeking personal glory who is trying to get 

reelected&quot;; 8 percent were unsure what to make of <a name="046"></a>McCarthy.



<a href="#46"><sup>Note 46</sup></a>  

About the same time, Gallup introduced a question that would be asked repeatedly in the 


decades that followed: &quot;Here's an interesting experiment.  You will notice that the squares on 

the chart go from one extreme of plus 5 to the other extreme of minus 5.  Will you put your 

finger on the square which best expresses your felling about communism?&quot;  Not surprisingly, 

minus 5 was the overwhelming choice selected: 78 percent in <a name="047"></a>1951,

<a href="#47"><sup>Note 47</sup></a> 81 percent in 1952, <a name="048"></a>89

<a href="#48"><sup>Note 48</sup></a> percent in <a name="049"></a>1953,

<a href="#49"><sup>Note 49</sup></a> 

and 94 percent in <a name="050"></a>1954.<a href="#50"><sup>Note 50</sup></a></p>

<p>     Communist China also remained a persistent issue for survey research questioning. 

Following the successful coup by Mao Zedong, Americans were queried whether they favored the

admission of the new People's Republic of China into the United Nations.  Not surprisingly, 

they were steadfastly opposed.  In 1955, 53 percent said the United States &quot;should not go 

along if a majority of the members of the United Nations decides to admit Communist China to 

the United <a name="051"></a>Nations,&quot;<a href="#51"><sup>Note 51</sup></a> and 71 percent were 

opposed to admitting Communist China to that <a name="052"></a>body.

<a href="#52"><sup>Note 52</sup></a></p>

<p>     An underlying theme of the Gallup studies done during the 1950s was a widespread 

belief that there were many communists in the country who were well-placed in the government 

and in defense industries.  In 1954, 74 percent said that there were communists in the 

government in <a name="053"></a>Washington<a href="#53"><sup>Note 53</sup></a> and 72 percent 

believed &quot;it is a good idea for people to report to the FBI any neighbors or acquaintances 

whom they suspected of being <a name="054"></a>communists.&quot;

<a href="#54"><sup>Note 54</sup></a>  

Such beliefs left many Americans altogether willing to suspend constitutional protections as 

the Cold War became hotter.  In 1954, the Gallup Organization and the National Opinion 

Research Center joined forces to commission a major study on American attitudes toward basic 

civil liberties when communism was at issue.  The results, as shown in Table 4, were not 

especially heartening.</p>

<p>Source: Gallup Organization and the National Opinion Research Center, May-July 1954.</p>

<p><strong><em>The 1960s</em></strong></p>



<p>     During the 1960s, three issues emerged in the Gallup data, each with its own unique

connection to the challenges communism posed to the American democracy: (1) what to do in the

event of a nuclear war, (2) the connection some Americans made between turmoil over the civil

rights issue and communist involvement in stirring up racial trouble, and (3) the challenges 

posed by communist advances in South Vietnam.  As to the first issue, when asked if they had 

to make a decision between fighting an all-out nuclear war or living under communist rule, 

Americans were near-unanimous: fight.  Eighty percent said they would fight a nuclear war, 

just 6 percent said they would prefer living under communism given this Hobson's 

<a name="055"></a>Choice.

<a href="#55"><sup>Note 55</sup></a></p>

<p>     The civil rights issue became linked to the Cold War in the minds of many Americans.  

In September 1964, 46 percent agreed with the statement: &quot;Most of the organizations pushing 

for civil rights have been infiltrated by the communists and are now dominated by communist

trouble-makers.&quot;  Thirty-five percent disagreed and 19 percent professed not to know.  A

November 2, 1965 survey found 48 percent believing that communists had taken a large part in 

civil rights demonstrations, and an additional 27 percent said communists had some role in 

organizing these public protests.  Only 16 percent said communists had either a minor role or 

no role at all in organizing these public <a name="056"></a>outbursts.

<a href="#56"><sup>Note 56</sup></a>  (There is much more additional work needed to examine 

the connections between progress in the civil rights area and the Cold War.)</p>

<p>     But it was the Vietnam War, and the ever-growing U.S. involvement in it, that were the

subject of most Gallup inquiries.  Fifty-eight percent in a November 1965 survey said that the

communists had been involved in organizing protests over the Vietnam <a name="057"></a>War.

<a href="#57"><sup>Note 57</sup></a>  As the war dragged on without a decisive conclusion, 

Americans perceived that U.S. national interests were at stake.  An interesting November 1967 

Gallup survey asked: &quot;Which country do you regard as the greater threat to the United 

States--a communist-controlled Cuba or a communist-controlled Vietnam?&quot;  Cuba narrowly edged 

out Vietnam, 43 percent to 42 percent--this despite the fact that Cuba is located a mere 

ninety miles from the U.S. mainland, while Vietnam is thousands of miles 

<a name="058"></a>away.<a href="#58"><sup>Note 58</sup></a>  The so-called &quot;domino theory,&quot; 

advocated by the Johnson Administration, was shared by a large segment of the vox populi.</p>

<p><strong><em>The 1970s</em></strong></p>

<p>     During the 1970s, three aspects of the Cold War were the focus of the Gallup surveys: 

(1) What to do about the stalemate in Vietnam and how would Americans react to a communist

victory there? (2) How should U.S. foreign policy be re-calibrated in light of the defeat in

Vietnam? and (3) Did Americans still believe that containing communism should be the

preeminent goal of U.S. foreign policy?  As to the first, Americans were willing to accept a

settlement of the Vietnam War, even if it meant a communist takeover.  An April 1971 Gallup

survey asked the following: &quot;Suppose the U.S. were confronted with a choice of only the two

alternatives listed on this card, which one would you rather have the U.S. follow?: (1) End 

the war by accepting the best possible compromise settlement even though it might sooner or 

later allow the Vietnamese Communists do take over control of South Vietnam or (2) Fight on 

until a settlement can be reached which will insure that the communists to not get control of 

South Vietnam.&quot;  End the war won 54 percent backing, 37 percent chose to fight on, and 9 

percent had no <a name="059"></a>opinion.<a href="#59"><sup>Note 59</sup></a>  However, the 

same poll found that 58 percent would be more upset if the communists took over in South 

Vietnam; a mere 18 percent would be more bothered by the fact that the U.S. would suffer a 

humiliating military <a name="060"></a>defeat.<a href="#60"><sup>Note 60</sup></a></p>

<p>     On the heels of the North Vietnamese entry into Saigon in 1975, the Gallup 

Organization examined where and to what extent Americans would be willing to place U.S. 

military forces should the communists threaten other nations.  The question designed to test 

such reactions went like this: &quot;In the event a nation is attacked by communist-backed forces, 

there are several things the U.S. can do about it.  As I read the name of each country, tell 

me what action you would want to see us take if that nation is actually attacked--send 

American troops, or send military supplies but not send American troops, or refuse to get 

involved at all.&quot;  Several countries were read to the respondents with the following results 

depicted on Table 5.</p>

<p>Source: Gallup Organization, survey, April 18-25, 1975.  Text of question: &quot;In the event a 

nation is attacked by communist-backed forces there are several things the U.S. can do about 

it.  As I read the name of each country, tell me what action you would want to see the U.S. 

take if that nation is actually attacked--send American troops, or send military supplies but 

not send American troops, or refuse to get involved at all.  What action would you want to see 

if [name of country] is attacked?&quot;</p>

<p>     Despite the increased reluctance of Americans to John F. Kennedy's 1961 Inaugural

commitment to &quot;bear any price&quot; in order to defend freedom, the public was still reluctant to

denounce the containment policy that guided U.S. policymakers following World War II.  The

same Gallup poll that examined when and where Americans were willing to place U.S. forces

abroad found 53 percent believing that the U.S. should continue to pursue a containment 

policy, 37 percent wanted it abandoned, and 10 percent had no <a name="061"></a>opinion.

<a href="#61"><sup>Note 61</sup></a>  But the nation no longer had JFK's sense of 

invincibility.  A 1976 Gallup poll found Americans evenly split as  to whether the U.S. 

&quot;should take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to prevent the spread of 

communism to any other party of the free world&quot;: 44 percent agreed, 43 percent disagreed, and 

13 percent had no <a name="062"></a>opinion.<a href="#62"><sup>Note 62</sup></a>  But 

containing communism remained an important objective to 60 percent of the 

<a name="063"></a>public.

<a href="#63"><sup>Note 63</sup></a> The 

disagreement was over how, where, and what means to use.</p>

<p><strong><em>The 1980s-1991</em></strong></p>

<p>     The 1980s found relatively little change in public attitudes toward communism--despite

the increased signs of political and economic disintegration within the Soviet Union.  

Fifty-nine percent mentioned &quot;containing communism&quot; as a &quot;very important&quot; U.S. foreign policy 

<a name="064"></a>goal<a href="#64"><sup>Note 64</sup></a> (a figure that held steady at 56 

percent in <a name="065"></a>1990),<a href="#65"><sup>Note 65</sup></a> and 60 percent held fast 

to the belief that there was &quot;an international communist conspiracy to rule the

<a name="066"></a>world.&quot;

<a href="#66"><sup>Note 66</sup></a>  Moreover, 56 percent believed that &quot;communists are 

responsible for a lot of the unrest in the United States <a name="067"></a>today.

<a href="#67"><sup>Note 67</sup></a>  In these three areas, public opinion had 

not changed much from the earliest days of the Cold War.</p>

<p>     During the 1980s, Americans were read a list of countries and asked whether a 

communist takeover would threaten U.S. interests overseas.  In nearly every case, the answer 

was yes.  Some examples: 74 percent said a communist takeover in Saudi Arabia would constitute 

a threat; Mexico, 80 percent; Iran, 59 percent; Taiwan, 54 percent; El Salvador, 70 percent; 

France, 68 percent; Phillippines, 72 percent; and South Africa, 61 <a name="068"></a>percent.

<a href="#68"><sup>Note 68</sup></a>  Close to home, Americans were divided over the Reagan 

administration's policy of helping the Contras in Nicaragua and fighting communist 

insurgencies in Angola and Afghanistan.  A 1987 Gallup poll found just 24 percent wanting to 

give economic and military aid to those rebel groups opposing communism, 32 percent favored 

only economic aid, and 39 percent wanted no aid given to these rebel <a name="069"></a>groups.

<a href="#69"><sup>Note 69</sup></a></p>

<p>     The ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev to power in the Soviet Union and his institution of

the perestroika and glasnost reforms gave rise to a series of polling questions.  In 1989,

Americans were asked if they believed the problems in Russia (and China after the Tiananmen

Square uprisings) were indications of the basic weakness of the communist system: 62 percent

answered yes; 26 percent said these were typical of the upheavals that all nations experience 

from time to <a name="070"></a>time.<a href="#70"><sup>Note 70</sup></a>  Even as Americans 

thought communism was corroding, they did not expect it to end and disbelieved it when it did.  

In 1989, Gallup wondered whether Soviet communism would have vanished by the year 2000.  

Sixty-eight percent said they did not expect this to happen or ventured no opinion; just 32 

percent believed Soviet-style communism would be no <a name="071"></a>more.

<a href="#71"><sup>Note 71</sup></a>  

After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, respondents were divided over its meaning: 46 percent 

thought it signified &quot;the beginning of the end of communism in the world&quot;; 47 percent 

<a name="072"></a>disagreed.<a href="#72"><sup>Note 72</sup></a>  The attempted coup against 

Gorbachev in August 1991 also saw Americans divided over its significance: 47 percent said it 

marked the end of communism, an equal number <a name="073"></a>disagreed.

<a href="#73"><sup>Note 73</sup></a></p>

                    <p><strong>The Cold War Party System</strong></p>

<p>     The political order the Cold War created gave the Republican party a much-needed 

respite from the devastating electoral defeats that threatened its existence during the 1930s.  

Back when Franklin D. Roosevelt won re-election in 1936 carrying every state except Maine and 

Vermont (two states that Bill Clinton won in 1996), his was more than a personal victory--it 

was a partisan triumph that nearly ended the two party system.  Democrats held 333 seats in 

the House and 75 in the Senate.  The Phoenix Republican editorialized that Roosevelt's 

&quot;present position is comparable only with that of Joseph <a name="074"></a>Stalin.&quot;

<a href="#74"><sup>Note 74</sup></a>  Yet less than two decades after Roosevelt's 1936 win, 

Republicans had persuaded a large segment of public opinion that the Democratic party was 

&quot;soft on communism.&quot;  When the National Opinion Research Center asked in 1950 which groups of 

Americans were more likely to be communists, the leading answers were 

labor union members (28 percent), poor people (21 percent), people in the government in 

Washington (18 percent), Negroes (14 percent), college students (13 percent), New Yorkers (12 

percent), Jews <a name="075"></a>(11 percent).<a href="#75"><sup>Note 75</sup></a>  Thus, less 

than five years after Franklin Roosevelt's death, his acclaimed New Deal coalition was already 

giving way to a xenophobic Republicanism whose leaders occupied the White House for much of 

the Cold War.  In the ten presidential elections held from 1952 to 1988, Republicans won seven 

of them.  Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, along with Barry Goldwater, are 

the founders of a modern Republicanism rooted in the Cold War. Anti-communism became the glue 

that bound all factions of the Republican party from Pat Robertson to Pat Buchanan.</p>

<p>     Survey research for Still Seeing Red reveals the strong advantage Republican 

presidential candidates held over their Democratic counterparts in presidential elections from 

1952-1988. Only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 held a sizable lead over his Republican opponent on the 

question of who best would handle the superpower relationship.  Johnson's lead was spurred by 

a series of rash Goldwater comments, including Goldwater's fabled answer that he would &quot;lob 

one into the men's room of the Kremlin&quot; if needed in order to win the Cold War.  Jimmy Carter 

had a narrow advantage over Ronald Reagan in 1980 as to which man could better manage 

U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations.  That lead, however, was initially the result of a perception that 

Reagan would be a trigger-happy president--a perception that Reagan effectively dissipated in 

his lone debate with Carter and later as president.</p>

                            <p><strong> What Comes Next? </strong></p>

<p>     The end of the Cold War has been no panacea.  Republicans have lost two presidential

elections (in 1992 and in 1996), while a Democratic president currently finds himself subject 

to a serious impeachment inquiry.  It is too soon to say what the shape of the post-Cold War 

party system will be, but it is apparent that everywhere one looks change is evident.  Shortly 

after the Cold War ended, Richard Nixon wrote:  &quot;We live in a new world--a world we helped 

<a name="076"></a>create.&quot;<a href="#76"><sup>Note 76</sup></a> But in this &quot;new world&quot; much 

that was once familiar has disappeared:  the old arrangements; the old way of doing things; 

indeed, the old order itself has collapsed.  In Moscow, for example, guardians of Lenin's tomb 

no longer rely on the Communist Party to pay the bills and have instead turned to a department 

store located across from Lenin's remains to defray the rent.  In effect, Russia's burgeoning 

capitalists are now preserving the corpse of the communist <a name="077"></a>founder.

<a href="#77"><sup>Note 77</sup></a></p>

<p>     Overseas, the absence of a serious communist threat (with the exception of North 

Korea) has not resulted in a safer world.  President Clinton has reminded his fellow 

countrymen that American leadership remains a foreign policy prerequisite: &quot;The disintegration 

of the former Soviet Union eliminated the preeminent threat but exposed many others: an 

increasingly tangled and dangerous web of international terrorism, crime, and drug 

trafficking; the aggression of rogue states and vicious ethnic and religious conflicts; the 

spread of dangerous weapons, including nuclear, biological, and chemical ones, and 

transnational threats like disease, overpopulation, and environmental degradation. . . .Just 

as fascism and then communism attacked the one clear and true idea that defines us and 

embodies the promise we represent to the world, today's threats attack the idea of a safe and 

open society of a free <a name="078"></a>people.&quot;<a href="#78"><sup>Note 78</sup></a></p>

<p>     But when reminded that John Kennedy won broad public backing for his activist foreign

policy, Clinton half-joked, &quot;Gosh, I miss the Cold War,&quot; adding: &quot;I envy Kennedy having an

enemy.  The question now is how to persuade people they should do things when they are not

immediately <a name="079"></a>threatened.&quot;<a href="#79"><sup>Note 79</sup></a>  Clinton's 

lament was understandable since the Cold War offered American presidents a useful enemy in 

communism.  As one White House chief-of-staff said: &quot;You tell [Congress] that they're helping 

no one but Brezhnev by their stubbornness, and they cave <a name="080"></a>fast.&quot;

<a href="#80"><sup>Note 80</sup></a>  But ethnic hatreds in 

Bosnia, the generals' coup in Haiti, and tribal conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda 

lack a similar compelling moral appeal.  Republican Patrick J. Buchanan espoused a return to 

the pre-World War II &quot;America First&quot; isolationism:  &quot;Every nation to rise to industrial power 

in modern times did so by first protecting the home market.  Perhaps [cities are in crisis] 

because the good jobs that were once there have been exported to Mexico, Taiwan, Korea, and 

<a name="081"></a>China.&quot;<a href="#81"><sup>Note 81</sup></a></p>

  

<p>      After the Cold War, Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., claimed:  &quot;[The Cold War]

distorted our politics, and foreign policy became the obsessive concern of our presidents, and 

that is going to return to normal <a name="082"></a>now.&quot;<a href="#82"><sup>Note 82</sup></a>  

But what is &quot;normal?&quot;  Americans seemed to be rushing backward and forward simultaneously:  

backward into an age of heightened nationalism, old-fashioned conservatism, and an evocation 

of &quot;traditional values,&quot; and forward into an era where the global economy makes a mockery of 

nationalism and computers link the individual to a vast panoply of data on the &quot;information 

superhighway.&quot;  Political analyst Michael Barone saw &quot;normalcy&quot; in a return to Tocqueville's 

America where the United States was even more egalitarian, individualistic, decentralized, 

religious, property-loving, and lightly <a name="083"></a>governed.

<a href="#83"><sup>Note 83</sup></a> Agreeing with Barone, the 1996 Republican 

platform proposed eliminating the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, 

Education, and Energy.  Republicans also advocated the defunding or privitazation of agencies 

that had become, in their view, obsolete. Among these were the National Endowment for the 

Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation.  In 

addition, some Republican congressmen backed a measure that would require proponents of  

proposed federal legislation to cite the specific constitutional authority for the 

<a name="084"></a>proposal.

<a href="#84"><sup>Note 84</sup></a></p>

<p>     Others saw &quot;normalcy&quot; in a resurgent Congress and a weakened presidency.  During the

Cold War, political scientists extolled the presidency--even as they decried the excessive 

burdens the atomic bomb and accompanying destruction of people placed on it.  Clinton Rossiter 

in his book, The American Presidency (penned long before the Watergate scandal), celebrated it 

as an &quot;office of freedom&quot; in the struggle against communism:  &quot;The presidency is a standing 

reproach to those petty doctrinaires who insist that executive power is inherently 

undemocratic; for, to the exact contrary, it has been more responsive to the needs and dreams 

of giant democracy than any other office or institution in the whole mosaic of American life. 

. . .The vast power of this office has not been  poison,' as Henry Adams wrote in scorn; 

rather, it has elevated often and corrupted never, chiefly because those who held it 

recognized the true source of the power and were ennobled by the <a name="085"></a>knowledge.&quot;

<a href="#85"><sup>Note 85</sup></a></p>

<p>     Yet Rossiter acknowledged that the Cold War had extracted an enormous toll on each

White House occupant.  In an epigraph, Rossiter borrowed lines from William Shakespeare's

Macbeth:  &quot;Methought I heard a voice cry  Sleep no more!'&quot;  A few days before his 

assassination Rossiter sent President Kennedy an autographed copy of his work.  Kennedy 

replied that he enjoyed the book, but thought the epigraph wrong.  Instead of MacBeth, Kennedy 

suggested other Shakespearean lines from King Henry IV in which Glendower boasts:  &quot;I can call 

spirits from the vasty deep,&quot; to which the reply is given:</p>

<blockquote>

          Why, so can I, or so can any man;

          But will they come when you do call for <a name="086"></a>them?

		  <a href="#86"><sup>Note 86</sup></a>

</blockquote>

<p>     The Cold War gave American presidents many opportunities to summon spirits from the

&quot;vasty deep.&quot;  As Woodrow Wilson noted in Congressional Government, when it came to foreign

policy matters congressional supremacy inevitably yielded to presidential authority:  &quot;When

foreign affairs play a prominent part in the politics and policy of a nation, its Executive 

must of necessity be its guide:  must utter every initial judgment, take every first step of 

action, supply the information upon which it is to act, suggest and in large measure control 

its <a name="087"></a>conduct.&quot;<a href="#87"><sup>Note 87</sup></a>  Thirteen years after 

Wilson published Congressional Government William McKinley's successful war with Spain in 1898 

made Wilson's picture of congressional supremacy, in his words, &quot;hopelessly out of 

<a name="088"></a>date.&quot;

<a href="#88"><sup>Note 88</sup></a></p>

<p>     Following the Cold War, Wilson's portrait of Congress as the first among equals has 

been refurbished.  After the demise of the Soviet Union, columnist George Will presciently 

wrote: &quot;Peace is going to be hell for presidents, at least for those not reconciled to the 

restoration of what is, when viewed against the sweep of American history, normal:  

congressional <a name="089"></a>supremacy.&quot;<a href="#89"><sup>Note 89</sup></a>  Issues such 

as health care, welfare reform, and the state of the economy encroached on precious committee 

provinces.  The president had become, in effect, the Governor of the United States--leading, 

but responsive to legislative assertions of authority. This was not an especially exciting 

role, however. Confiding to his staff late one evening in January 1995 Clinton lamented that 

there was no longer an air of crisis surrounding the White House: &quot;I would have much preferred 

being president during World War II.  I'm a person out of my <a name="090"></a>time.&quot;

<a href="#90"><sup>Note 90</sup></a></p>

<p>     Nonetheless, Clinton sought to reclaim his precious powers by finding a new &quot;enemy&quot; in

Congress itself--no matter which party controlled it.  Presidential polltaker Stanley B. 

Greenberg found that respondents were not measuring Clinton by his management of foreign 

affairs or how he played the commander-in-chief role, but whether or not he could tame 

Congress.  In a report titled The Presidential Project dated August 11, 1993, Greenberg 

advised Clinton that the Democratic Congress had become &quot;the new Soviet Union,&quot; adding that 

John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan had made opposing communism the &quot;moral 

imperative of their presidencies&quot; and that Clinton should make controlling Congress his moral 

<a name="091"></a>imperative.<a href="#91"><sup>Note 91</sup></a>   In other words, Clinton 

should restrain Congress while also peacefully coexisting with it--i.e., a domestic 

Soviet-style containment recipe with a dash of detente.  But Clinton believed managing 

Congress could not be &quot;the sum and substance of this <a name="092"></a>presidency.&quot;

<a href="#92"><sup>Note 92</sup></a>  Instead, he relied on amorphous 

references to traditional values such as &quot;opportunity, community, and responsibility&quot; to be 

his guides.</p>

<p>     Clinton's public ruminations about the nature of the post-Cold War presidency did not

prevent Congress from asserting its &quot;traditional&quot; peacetime powers.  House Speaker Newt

Gingrich observed that a succession of chief executives, including Clinton, had become

excessively dependent on the first person personal pronoun:  &quot;We'll try to educate the 

president and his staff that the use of  I' is not helpful,&quot; adding that the presidency was no 

longer &quot;towering over the <a name="093"></a>land.&quot;<a href="#93"><sup>Note 93</sup></a>  

Following in the footsteps of Henry Cabot Lodge and Robert Taft, Gingrich advocated a return 

to the Wilsonian idea of &quot;congressional government.&quot;  In a book titled To Renew America, 

Gingrich declared:  &quot;With the end of the Cold War, the case for a strong central government 

has been dramatically weakened.  The time has come for a revision to first principles. In 

America, one of those first principles is that power resides first and foremost with the 

individual <a name="094"></a>citizen.&quot;<a href="#94"><sup>Note 94</sup></a>  Many of Gingrich's 

fellow Republicans said they were &quot;citizen-politicians,&quot; sent to Washington for a short period 

before returning <a name="095"></a>home.<a href="#95"><sup>Note 95</sup></a>  But Gingrich's 

idea of a Congress populated with &quot;citizen-politicians&quot; contains a profound irony:  ceding 

much legislative authority to the states, from welfare reform to health care, in the form of 

block grants.</p>

<p>     Thus, in the intrigues between the president and Congress following the Cold War, 

there is evidently no &quot;normalcy&quot; to which to return.  Faced with such profound philosophical 

and institutional revisionism, an exasperated Bill Clinton declared:  &quot;We are debating things 

now we thought were settled for decades.  We are back to fundamental issues that were debated 

like this fifty, sixty, seventy years <a name="096"></a>ago.&quot;<a href="#96"><sup>Note 

96</sup></a>  In many ways, the end of the Cold War recalls Abraham Lincoln's famous words 

during the dark days of the Civil War:  &quot;The dogmas of the past are inadequate to the stormy 

present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.  As 

our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.  We must disenthrall ourselves, and then 

we shall save our <a name="097"></a>country.&quot;<a href="#97"><sup>Note 97</sup></a>  As with 

Lincoln, disenthralling ourselves from first principles often follows a prolonged conflict (or 

can occur during wartime as with Lincoln). Turning back the pages of history one discovers 

that after the Revolutionary War Americans directed their energies to the first principles of 

nation-building and creating the necessary constitutional arrangements to sustain these 

efforts.  Likewise, after the War of 1812 taming a big country (substantially enlarged after 

the Louisiana Purchase) provided a sense of &quot;manifest destiny.&quot;  Economic expansion and the 

creation of a party system also tapped into these energies, especially after the collapse of 

the Federalist Party.  The post-Civil War years saw the reconstruction of the Old Confederacy 

and the assembling of a great industrial engine that resulted in what Herbert Croly aptly 

called &quot;the promise of American <a name="098"></a>life.&quot;<a href="#98"><sup>Note 98</sup></a>  

In 1907, an energetic President Theodore Roosevelt bragged that the United States had become 

&quot;the mightiest republic on which the sun ever <a name="099"></a>shone.&quot;

<a href="#99"><sup>Note 99</sup></a>  But following World War I, the country wandered 

aimlessly before Theodore Roosevelt's jaunty cousin Franklin restored America's mission and 

confidence.</p>

<p>     From the mid-twentieth century to 1991, war and near-war gave Americans a fixed sense

of who the enemy was and who we were.  Ever since 1941 the United States has been on a

war-footing--either in a general war, such as World War II--or at various times during the 

Cold War on the brink of World War III.  The fall of Soviet communism may mark the &quot;end of 

history&quot; of a kind.  But in reality, the 1990s represent a caesura as one era closes and 

another opens.  Historian Eric Hobsbawm noted that the war-filled and state enhancing &quot;short 

twentieth century&quot; that began in 1914 ended in 1991 and has become part of the history books.  

On all planes, he argues, &quot;we are moving into a radically different twenty-first century a 

decade <a name="0100"></a>early.&quot;<a href="#100"><sup>Note 100</sup></a>  How Americans will react is 

certainly worthy of additional study.  As this paper has sought to demonstrate, opinion 

surveys are a useful tool to examine how Americans arrive at important public and policy 

judgments.</p>
