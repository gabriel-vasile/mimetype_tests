<h3><em>Acknowledgments</em></h3>
</center>
<p>
As with most works, many have had a hand (or, better said, a brain) in the preparation of this Newport Paper. Members of my &quot;Board of Directors&quot; helped clarify ambiguities. This Board included:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vice Admiral Vernon E. Clark, formerly Commander Second Fleet, currently Director for Operations (J-3), Joint Staff
<li>Vice Admiral John J. Mazach, Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
<li>Vice Admiral Richard W. Mies, Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
<li>Vice Admiral Henry C. Giffin, III, Commander Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
My staff also provided invaluable help, especially the more senior and experienced members:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Roger N. Whiteway, Director for Warfare Requirements and Program Planning, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
<li>Rear Admiral John M. Luecke, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
<li>Rear Admiral David R. Ruble, Director, Logistics/Fleet Supply Officer, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
<li>Rear Admiral Arthur Clark (Retired), former Fleet Maintenance Officer, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
And, finally, I acknowledge the assistance of Lieutenant John Freymann, USNR, a Navy junior and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago. I suspect he deeply enjoyed giving advice to an admiral and to his father, and having them follow it. Without his writing and thinking ability, and his frequent judicious challenges, this Paper would be less readable and less intelligible.
<p>
All these people have my admiration for their patience and my deep appreciation for their assistance.
