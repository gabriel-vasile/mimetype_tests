           IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THAT IS THE PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY
           AND THE MEDICARE SURPLUS. NOW MY LEGISLATION REASSURES THE
           AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT
           SPEND A PENNY OF THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE MONEY AND
           IT CREATES A MECHANISM TO ENFORCE OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING
           THESE SURPLUSES. THIS LOOK BACK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS SIMPLE

           MONEY WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE

           GRAMM-RUDMAN HOLLINGS, BUT A PLACE TO SPENDING OF SOCIAL
           SECURITY AND MEDICARE SURPLUS FUNDS. NOW I STRESS THE SEQUESTER
