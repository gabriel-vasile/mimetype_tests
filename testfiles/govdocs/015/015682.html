      HIGHLIGHTS </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> More than half of 
        Guatemalans are descendants of Mayan Indians. Westernized Mayans and <i>mestizos</i> 
        (mixed European and Indian) are known as ladinos. Most of Guatemala's 
        population is rural, though urbanization is accelerating. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The predominant religion 
        is Roman Catholicism, into which many Indians have incorporated traditional 
        forms of worship. Protestantism and traditional Mayan religions are practiced 
        by an estimated 30% of the population. Though the official language is 
        Spanish, it is not universally understood among the indigenous population. 
        However, the peace accords signed in December 1996 provide for the translation 
        of some official documents and voting materials into several indigenous 
        languages (see summary of main substantive accords). </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Mayan civilization 
        flourished throughout much of Guatemala and the surrounding region long 
        before the Spanish arrived, but it was already in decline when the Mayans 
        were defeated by Pedro de Alvarado in 1523-24. During Spanish colonial 
        rule, most of Central America came under the control of the Captaincy 
        General of Guatemala. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first colonial 
        capital, Ciudad Vieja, was ruined by floods and an earthquake in 1542. 
        Survivors founded Antigua, the second capital, in 1543. In the 17th century, 
        Antigua became one of the richest capitals in the New World. Always vulnerable 
        to volcanic eruptions, floods, and earthquakes, Antigua was destroyed 
        by two earthquakes in 1773, but the remnants of its Spanish colonial architecture 
        have been preserved as a national monument. The third capital, Guatemala 
        City, was founded in 1776, after Antigua was abandoned. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala gained 
        independence from Spain on September 15, 1821; it briefly became part 
        of the Mexican Empire and then for a period belonged to a federation called 
        the United Provinces of Central America. From the mid-19th century until 
        the mid-1980s, the country passed through a series of dictatorships, insurgencies 
        (particularly beginning in the 1960s), coups, and stretches of military 
        rule with only occasional periods of representative government. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1944 to 1986</b> 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1944, Gen. Jorge 
        Ubico's dictatorship was overthrown by the &quot;October Revolutionaries&quot;--a 
        group of dissident military officers, students, and liberal professionals. 
        A civilian president, Juan Jose Arevalo, was elected in 1945 and held 
        the presidency until 1951. Social reforms initiated by Arevalo were continued 
        by his successor, Col. Jacobo Arbenz. Arbenz permitted the communist Guatemalan 
        Labor Party to gain legal status in 1952. By the mid-point of Arbenz's 
        term, communists controlled key peasant organizations, labor unions, and 
        the governing political party, holding some key government positions. 
        Despite most Guatemalans' attachment to the original ideals of the 1944 
        uprising, some private sector leaders and the military viewed Arbenz's 
        policies as a menace. The army refused to defend the Arbenz Government 
        when a group led by Col. Carlos Castillo Armas invaded the country from 
        Honduras in 1954 and eventually took over the government. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In response to the 
        increasingly autocratic rule of General Ydigoras Fuentes, who took power 
        in 1958 following the murder of Col. Castillo Armas, a group of junior 
        military officers revolted in 1960. When they failed, several went into 
        hiding and established close ties with Cuba. This group became the nucleus 
        of the forces that were in armed insurrection against the government for 
        the next 36 years. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Three principal left-wing 
        guerrilla groups--the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP), the Revolutionary 
        Organization of Armed People (ORPA), and the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR)--conducted 
        economic sabotage and targeted government installations and members of 
        government security forces in armed attacks. These three organizations, 
        plus a fourth--the outlawed communist party, known as the PGT--combined 
        to form the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) in 1982. At 
        the same time, extreme right-wing groups of self-appointed vigilantes, 
        including the Secret Anti-Communist Army (ESA) and the White Hand, tortured 
        and murdered students, professionals, and peasants suspected of involvement 
        in leftist activities. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Shortly after President 
        Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro took office in 1966, the army launched a 
        major counterinsurgency campaign that largely broke up the guerrilla movement 
        in the countryside. The guerrillas then concentrated their attacks in 
        Guatemala City, where they assassinated many leading figures, including 
        U.S. Ambassador John Gordon Mein in 1968. Between 1966 and 1982, there 
        were a series of military or military-dominated governments. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In March 1982, army 
        troops commanded by junior officers staged a coup to prevent the assumption 
        of power by former Defense Minister Gen. Anibal Guevara, whose electoral 
        victory was marred by fraud. The coup leaders asked Brig. Gen. Efrain 
        Jose Rios Montt to negotiate the departure of presidential incumbent General 
        Lucas Garcia. Rios Montt had been the candidate of the Christian Democratic 
        Party in the 1974 presidential elections and was also widely believed 
        to have lost by fraud. Rios Montt formed a three-member junta that annulled 
        the 1965 constitution, dissolved the Congress, suspended political parties, 
        and canceled the election law. Shortly thereafter, Rios Montt assumed 
        the title of President of the Republic. Responding to a wave of violence, 
        the government imposed a state of siege, while at the same time forming 
        an advisory Council of State to guide a return to democracy. In 1983, 
        electoral laws were promulgated, the state of siege was lifted, political 
        activity was once again allowed, and constituent assembly elections scheduled. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guerrilla forces 
        and their leftist allies then denounced the new government and stepped 
        up attacks. Rios Montt sought to combat the threat with military actions 
        and economic reforms, in his words, &quot;rifles and beans.&quot; The 
        government formed civilian defense forces which, along with the army, 
        successfully contained the insurgency. However, on August 8, 1983, Rios 
        Montt was deposed by the Guatemalan army, and Minister of Defense, Gen. 
        Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, was proclaimed head of state. General Mejia 
        claimed that certain &quot;religious fanatics&quot; were abusing their 
        positions in the government and that corruption had to be weeded out. 
        Constituent assembly elections were held on July 1, 1984. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On May 30, 1985, 
        after nine months of debate, the constituent assembly finished drafting 
        a new constitution, which took immediate effect. Mejia called general 
        elections. The Christian Democratic Party (DCG) candidate, Vinicio Cerezo, 
        won the presidency with almost 70% of the vote and took office in January 
        1986. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1986 to 1996</b> 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon its inauguration 
        in January 1986, President Cerezo's civilian government announced that 
        its top priorities would be to end the political violence and establish 
        the rule of law. Reforms included new laws of habeas corpus and amparo 
        (court-ordered protection), the creation of a legislative human rights 
        committee, and the establishment in 1987 of the office of Human Rights 
        Ombudsman. The Supreme Court also embarked on a series of reforms to fight 
        corruption and improve legal system efficiency. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With Cerezo's election, 
        the military returned to its more traditional role of fighting against 
        the insurgents. The first two years of Cerezo's Administration were characterized 
        by a stable economy and a marked decrease in political violence. Two coup 
        attempts were made in May 1988 and May 1989 by dissatisfied military personnel, 
        but military leadership supported the constitutional order. The government 
        was heavily criticized for its unwillingness to investigate or prosecute 
        cases of human rights violations. The final two years of Cerezo's Government 
        also were marked by a failing economy, strikes, protest marches, and allegations 
        of widespread corruption. The government's inability to deal with many 
        of the nation's problems--such as infant mortality, illiteracy, deficient 
        health and social services, and rising levels of violence--contributed 
        to popular discontent. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Presidential and 
        congressional elections were held on November 11, 1990. After a runoff 
        ballot, Jorge Serrano was inaugurated on January 14, 1991, thus completing 
        the first transition from one democratically elected civilian government 
        to another. Because his Movement of Solidarity Action (MAS) party gained 
        only 18 of 116 seats in Congress, Serrano entered into a tenuous alliance 
        with the Christian Democrats and the National Union of the Center (UCN). 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Serrano Administration's 
        record was mixed. It had some success in consolidating civilian control 
        over the army, replacing a number of senior officers and persuading the 
        military to participate in peace talks with the URNG. He took the politically 
        unpopular step of recognizing the sovereignty of Belize. The Serrano Government 
        reversed the economic slide it inherited, reducing inflation and boosting 
        real growth from 3% in 1990 to almost 5% in 1992. On May 25, 1993, Serrano 
        illegally dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court and tried to restrict 
        civil freedoms, allegedly to fight corruption. The &quot;autogolpe&quot; 
        (or autocoup) failed due to unified, strong protests by most elements 
        of Guatemalan society, international pressure, and the army's enforcement 
        of the decisions of the Court of Constitutionality, which ruled against 
        the attempted takeover. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the face of this 
        pressure, Serrano fled the country. On June 5, 1993, the Congress, pursuant 
        to the 1985 constitution, elected the Human Rights Ombudsman, Ramiro De 
        Leon Carpio, to complete Serrano's presidential term. De Leon, not a member 
        of any political party and lacking a political base, but with strong popular 
        support, launched an ambitious anti-corruption campaign to &quot;purify&quot; 
        Congress and the Supreme Court, demanding the resignations of all members 
        of the two bodies. Despite considerable congressional resistance, presidential 
        and popular pressure led to a November 1993 agreement brokered by the 
        Catholic Church between the government and Congress. This package of constitutional 
        reforms was approved by popular referendum on January 30, 1994. In August 
        1994, a new Congress was elected to complete the unexpired term. Controlled 
        by the anti-corruption parties--the Populist Republican Front (FRG) headed 
        by ex-General Efrain Rios Montt, and the center-right National Advancement 
        Party (PAN)--the new Congress began to move away from the corruption that 
        characterized its predecessors. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Under De Leon, the 
        peace process, now brokered by the United Nations, took on new life. The 
        government and the URNG signed agreements on Human Rights (March 1994), 
        Resettlement of Displaced Persons (June 1994), Historical Clarification 
        (June 1994), and Indigenous Rights (March 1995). They also made significant 
        progress on a Socio-economic and Agrarian Agreement. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> National elections 
        for President, the Congress, and municipal offices were held in November 
        1995. With almost 20 parties competing in the first round, the presidential 
        election came down to a January 7, 1996 runoff in which PAN candidate 
        Alvaro Arzu defeated Alfonso Portillo of the FRG by just over 2% of the 
        vote. Arzu won because of his strength in Guatemala City, where he had 
        previously served as mayor, and in the surrounding urban area. Portillo 
        won all of the rural departments. The biggest surprise of the election 
        was the strong showing of the newly formed New Guatemala Democratic Front 
        (FDNG), the first legitimate party of the left to compete in 40 years. 
        The FDNG presidential candidate won almost 8% of the vote, and six FDNG 
        deputies, including several internationally known human rights advocates, 
        were elected to Congress. In the other November races, the PAN won 43 
        of the 80 seats in Congress and leadership of one-third of the municipal 
        governments. The FRG won 21 seats to become the principal opposition party. 
        The formerly powerful but discredited DCG and UCN elected only seven deputies 
        between them. </font></p>

        in the unicameral structure, from 116 to 80, and an increase in the number 
        of Supreme Court justices from nine to 13. The terms of office for president,

        to the Rio Pact and is a member of the Central American Defense Council 
        (CONDECA). The president is commander-in-chief. The Defense Minister is 
        responsible for policy. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of 
        the chief of staff and the national defense staff. An agreement signed 
        in September 1996 (which is one of the substantive peace accords), mandated 
        that the mission of the armed forces change to focus exclusively on external 
        threats, although President Arzu has ordered the army to support the police 
        in response to public concern about a nationwide wave of violent crime. 
        The accord calls for a one-third reduction in the army's authorized strength 
        and budget, and for a constitutional amendment to permit the appointment 
        of a civilian Minister of Defense. </font>

      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon taking office, 
        the Arzu Administration made resolution of the 36-year internal conflict 
        before the end of 1996 its highest priority. President Arzu took the bold 
        steps necessary to breathe life into the peace process and to increase 
        civilian control over the military. He traveled to Mexico and El Salvador 
        to meet with guerrilla leaders, thus adding impetus to the peace process 
        and leading to subsequent agreements on: socio-economic/agrarian issues 
        which were signed in May; the strengthening of civil society and the role 
        of the military in a democracy in September; a definitive ceasefire, constitutional 
        and electoral reforms, and an agreement on the reinsertion of the URNG 
        into political life in Guatemala in December. The final agreement, signed 
        on December 29, 1996, contributed significantly to an improvement in Guatemala's 
        human rights (see last page for summary of main substantive accords). 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Within two weeks 
        of taking office, President Arzu initiated a major shakeup of the military 
        high command and oversaw the firing of almost 200 corrupt police officials. 
        In September 1996, the government uncovered a large smuggling scheme involving 
        a number of government officials and military and police officers. The 
        case, which is expected to take a number of years to resolve, resulted 
        in the dismissal of several additional military, police, and customs officials. 
        The Arzu Administration also began a series of actions to boost the economy, 
        including a reform of the tax system, and demonopolization and privatization 
        of the electricity and telecommunication sectors. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> President Alvaro 
        Arzu has strongly and publicly condemned human rights abuses. Positive 
        political developments and the demobilization of 200,000 members of the 
        Civilian Defense Patrols were major factors in the positive change. In 
        contrast to past years, there was a marked decline in new cases of human 
        rights abuse, but problems remain in some areas. Common crime, aggravated 
        by a legacy of violence and vigilante justice, presents a serious challenge 
        to the government. Impunity remains a major problem, primarily because 
        democratic institutions, including those responsible for the administration 
        of justice, have developed only a limited capacity to cope with this legacy. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The human rights 
        accord signed in March 1994 called for the immediate establishment of 
        a UN Human Rights Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), which began 
        to operate in November 1994. The presence of MINUGUA has been a highly 
        positive factor in improving respect for human rights. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala's GDP for 
        1997 is estimated at $16 billion, with real growth of approximately 4%. 
        The government has initiated a number of programs aimed at liberalizing 
        the economy and improving the investment climate. After the signing of 
        the final peace accord in December 1996, Guatemala is well-positioned 
        for rapid economic growth over the next several years. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala's economy 
        is dominated by the private sector, which generates about 85% of GDP. 
        Agriculture contributes 24% of GDP and accounts for 75% of exports. Most 
        manufacturing is light assembly and food processing, geared to the domestic, 
        U.S., and Central American markets. Over the past several years, tourism 
        and exports of textiles, apparel, and non-traditional agricultural products 
        such as winter vegetables, fruit, and cut flowers have boomed, while more 
        traditional exports such as cotton, sugar, and coffee continue to represent 
        a large share of the export market. The United States is the country's 
        largest trading partner, providing 44% of Guatemala's imports and receiving 
        31% of its exports. The government sector is small and shrinking, with 
        its business activities limited to public utilities (which are to be privatized) 
        and several development-oriented financial institutions. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Current economic 
        priorities include: </font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liberalizing the 
          trade and foreign exchange regimes; </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simplifying the 
          tax structure, enhancing tax compliance, and broadening the tax base. 
          At less than 8% of GDP, Guatemala's tax burden is among the lowest in 
          the Western Hemisphere; </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Restraining growth 
          of domestic credit, especially to the public sector; </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonopolizing 
          the electricity and telecommunications sectors and opening them to full 
          private sector participation; </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liberalizing the 
          market for petroleum products; and </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Improving the investment 
          climate through procedural and regulatory simplification and adopting 
          a goal of concluding treaties to protect investment and intellectual 
          property rights. </font> 
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Import tariffs have 
        been lowered in conjunction with Guatemala's Central American neighbors 
        so that most now fall between 1% and 20%, with further reductions planned. 
        Responding to Guatemala's changed political and economic policy environment, 
        the international community has mobilized substantial resources to support 
        the country's economic and social development objectives. The United States, 
        along with other donor countries--especially France, Italy, Spain, Germany, 
        Japan, and the international financial institutions--have increased development 
        project financing. Donors' response to the need for international financial 
        support funds for implementation of the peace accords is expected to be 
        good. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Problems hindering 
        economic growth include illiteracy and low levels of education; inadequate 
        and underdeveloped capital markets; and lack of infrastructure, particularly 
        in the transportation, telecommunications, and electricity sectors. The 
        distribution of income and wealth remains highly skewed. The wealthiest 
        10% of the population receives almost one-half of all income; the top 
        20% receives two-thirds of all income. As a result, more than half the 
        population lives in poverty, and two-thirds of that number live in extreme 
        poverty. Guatemala's social indicators, such as infant mortality and illiteracy, 
        are among the worst in the hemisphere. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala's major 
        diplomatic interests are regional security and, increasingly, regional 
        development and economic integration. The Central American Ministers of 
        Trade meet on a regular basis to work on regional approaches to trade 
        issues. In March 1997, Guatemala hosted the second annual Trade and Investment 
        Forum, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The two-day 
        event highlighted the growing relationship that Guatemala has with its 
        closest trading partners and offer regional opportunities to foreign investors. 
        In March 1998, Guatemala joined its Central American neighbors in signing 
        a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). Guatemala also originated 
        the idea for, and is the seat of, the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN). 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala participates 
        in several regional groups, particularly those related to the environment 
        and trade. For example, President Clinton and the Central American presidents 
        signed the CONCAUSA (Conjunto Centroamerica-USA) agreement at the Summit 
        of the Americas in December 1994. CONCAUSA is a cooperative plan of action 
        to promote clean, efficient energy use; conserve the region's biodiversity; 
        strengthen legal and institutional frameworks and compliance mechanisms; 
        and improve and harmonize environmental protection standards. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guatemala long laid 
        claim to Belize; the territorial dispute caused problems with the United 
        Kingdom and later with Belize following its 1981 independence from the 
        U.K. Relations have since improved. In 1986, Guatemala and the U.K. re-established 
        commercial and consular relations; in 1987, they re-established full diplomatic 
        relations. In December 1989, Guatemala sponsored Belize for permanent 
        observer status in the Organization of American States (OAS). In September 
        1991, Guatemala recognized Belize's independence and established diplomatic 
        ties, while acknowledging that the boundaries remained in dispute. Although 
        Belize has recognized Guatemalan diplomatic representation at the ambassadorial 
        level for several years, the Guatemalan Government did not accredit the 
        first ambassador from Belize until December 1996. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While Belize continues 
        to be a difficult domestic political issue in Guatemala, the two governments 
        have quietly maintained constructive relations. The Arzu Administration 
        has indicated its intent to resolve the dispute with Belize, making it 
        the number one priority now that the final peace accord has been signed. 
        In anticipation of an effort to bring the border dispute to an end, in 
        early 1996, the Guatemalan Congress ratified two long-pending international 
        agreements governing frontier issues and maritime rights. </font></p>

        as a member of &quot;the Friends of Guatemala,&quot; with Colombia, Mexico, 
        Spain, Norway, and Venezuela, played an important role in the UN-moderated 
        peace accords, providing public and behind-the-scenes support. The U.S. 
        strongly supports the six substantive and three procedural accords, which, 
        along with the signing of the December 29, 1996 final accord, form the 
        blueprint for profound political, economic, and social change. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Costa Rica in 
        May 1997, President Arzu met with President Clinton and his counterparts 
        from Central America, Belize, and the Dominican Republic to celebrate 
        the remarkable democratic transformation in the region and reaffirm support 
        for strengthening democracy, good governance, and promoting prosperity 
        through economic integration, free trade, and investment. The leaders 
        also expressed their commitment to the continued development of just and 
        equitable societies and responsible environmental policies as integral 
        elements of sustainable development. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Tangible support 
        for the implementation of the accords will come from a number of sources. 
        Development assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development 
        (USAID) is concentrated in programs to strengthen democratic institutions, 
        improve health and education, and protect the environment. The U.S. will 
        also provide up to $25 million dollars in FY 1998 Economic Support Funds, 
        including an immediate grant of $5 million, focused on the most immediate 
        needs associated with the implementation of the peace accords, such as 
        demobilization of the ex-combatants. The U.S. hopes to be able to continue 
        this level of support for another two years. To address the issue of impunity, 
        USAID and the Department of Justice are funding programs to strengthen 
        the courts, the public prosecutor's office, and the civilian police. Other 
        federal agencies such as the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and the 
        Treasury have programs either in place or in the planning stages to support 
        specific aspects of the peace accords. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The U.S. Government 
        suspended military aid to Guatemala in 1977 following an upsurge in death 
        squad activity and the publication of the Department's first human rights 
        report. Modest training assistance was reinstated in 1983, but suspended 
        again in 1990 in response to the murder of U.S. citizen Michael Devine 
        and the Guatemalan military's lack of cooperation in that investigation. 
        The U.S. Government eliminated access to IMET funds in 1995 over human 
        rights concerns. Currently, Guatemala is eligible for expanded IMET and 
        a program began in 1997. </font>

        Guatemala since 1986 totals about $965 million, and in 1997, the U.S. 
        provided $65 million in bilateral economic development assistance. </font>

        years, 1997 has seen a marked increase in incidents involving American 
        citizens.&quot; When visitors have problems, their first contacts are 
        often with the U.S. Embassy. Whether it is replacing a lost passport, 
        arranging for additional funds to be wired to a visitor in distress, or 
        assisting in locating a lost loved one, the embassy is prepared to help 
        American citizens traveling in Guatemala. Likewise, American businesses 
        find a relatively open and accommodating market in Guatemala, which is
