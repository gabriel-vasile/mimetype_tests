Never before, in all the annals of the world's history, did a
nation of abject and chattel slaves arise in the terriffic might
of their resuscitated manhood, and regenerate, redeem, and
disenthrall themselves : by taking their station at one gigan-
tic bound, as an independent nation, among the sovereignties
of the world.
It is, therefore, the unparalelled incidents that led to this
wonderful event, that I now intend to review rapidly, in order
to demonstrate thereby, the capacity of the negro race for
self-government and civilized progress, to the fullest extent
and in the highest sense of these terms.
PRELIMINARY INCIDENTS OF THE REVOLUTION.
I shall proceed to develop the first evidence of the compe- *
tenoy of the negro race for self-government, amid the histor-
ical   incidents   that preceded   their   terrible   and   bloody
revolution ; and in the events of that heroio struggle itself.
When the cosmopolitan ideas of " Liberty, Fraternity, and
Equality," which swayed the mighty minds of France, to-
ward the close of the 18th century, reached the colony of St.
Domingo, through the Massaic club, composed of wealthy
colonial planters, organized in the French capitol ; all classes
in that island, except the black slave and the free colored
man, were instantly wrought up to the greatest effervescence,
and swayed with the deepest emotions, by the startling doc-
trines of the equal political rights of all men, which were
then so boldly enunciated in the face of the tyrannical des-
potisms and the immemorial assumptions of the feudal
aristocracies of the old world.
The colonial dignitaries, the military officers, and other
agents of the government of France, then resident in St.
Domingo, the rich planters and the poor whites, (these latter
called in the parlance of that colony "Les petits blancs,)
were all from first to last, swayed with the intensest and the
most indescribable feelings, at the promulgation of these
bold and radical theories.
