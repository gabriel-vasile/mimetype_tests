beings to adequately use them. It becomes then an impor-
tant question for the negro race in America to well consider
the weighty responsibility that the present exigency devolves
upon them, to contribute to the continued advancement of
this negro nationality of the New World until its glory and
renown shall overspread and cover the whole earth, and re-
deem and regenerate by its influence in the future, the be-
nighted Fatherland of the race in Africa.
Here in this black nationality of the New World, erect-
ed under such glorious auspioes, is the stand point that
must be occupied, and the lever that must be exerted,
to regenerate and disenthrall the oppression and igno-
rance of the race, throughout the world. We must not
overlook this practical vantage ground which Providence has
raised up for us out of the depths of the sea, for any man-

us, to send us across the ocean, to rummage the graves of our
ancestors, in fruitless, and ill-directed efforts at the wrong end
of human progress. Civilization and Christianity is passing

coil backward to its fountain head. God, therefore in per-
mitting the accursed slave traffic to transplant so many mil-
lions of the race, to the New World, and educing therefrom
such a negro nationality as Hayti, indicates thereby, that we
have a work now to do here in the Western World, which in his
own good time shall shed its orient beams upon the Fatherland
of the race. Let us see to it, that we meet the exigency now
imposed upon us, as nobly on our part at this time as the Hay-
tians met theirs at the opening of the present century. And
in seeking to perform this duty, it may well be a question
with us, whether it is not our duty, to go and indentify our
destiny with our heroic brethren in that independent isle of
