worsened as a result of 11 September."  The March 22 memo addressed to
Secretary of State Straw from political director Peter Rickets notes that "even
the best survey of Iraq's WMD programmes will not show much advance in recent
years on the nuclear, missile, or CW/BW [chemical and biological weapons]
fronts."  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>These concerns are
echoed by other sources.  The original "Downing Street Memo" of July 23 stated,</span><span
style='font-family:Helvetica'> "the case was thin.  Saddam was not threatening
his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea
or Iran."  Carne Ross, a former British diplomat who worked closely with U.N.
inspectors in Iraq, recently undermined the pre-war WMD case even further,
saying, "I'd read the intelligence on WMD for four and a half years, and
there's no way that it could sustain the case that the government was
presenting.  All of my colleagues knew that, too." (<i>Guardian</i>, 6/20/05) 
And the British intelligence service MI6 reportedly delivered a Joint
Intelligence Committee Assessment on March 15, 2002, during the same time frame
that many of the newly leaked memos were written, asserting that intelligence
was "sporadic and patchy" and that </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>"[w]e

chemical warfare agent precursors, and may have hidden small quantities of

to look at evidence of that meeting.  And it's just more of a picture that is
emerging that there may well have been contacts between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Undersecretary
of Defense Paul Wolfowitz appears to have played a significant role in
developing the claim that the meeting between Atta and Iraqi intelligence
officials did occur.   In August 2002, <i>Newsweek</i> reported that "Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, an Iraq hawk, summoned two FBI officials to
brief him on claims by Czech intelligence that 9-11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had
met last year in Prague with an Iraqi intelligence agent.  Wolfowitz wanted the
FBI to endorse the Czech account to show ties between Saddam Hussein and Al
Qaeda.  But when FBI counterterrorism chief Pat D'Amuro and a case agent
expressed skepticism, Wolfowitz vigorously challenged them, says one source."
(8/19/02)  <i>Time</i> magazine later confirmed that, while certain officials
denied that Wolfowitz pressured the FBI for confirmation of the meeting, "the
FBI says the Pentagon team tried, with success, to persuade the bureau to
concede that reports of the meeting are at least possible." (9/2/02)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Wolfowitz
himself admitted to British officials, however, that this intelligence was uncertain. 
Reporting on his conversation with Wolfowitz in the March 18, 2002 memo,
Ambassador Christopher Meyer wrote, "Wolfowitz said that it was absurd to deny
the link between terrorism and Saddam.  There might be doubt about the alleged
meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker on 9/11, and Iraqi
intelligence (did we, he asked, know anything more about this meeting?)."  The
memo, along with reports that Czech president Vaclav Havel expressed doubts
about the meeting to the Bush Administration in the spring of 2002 (<i>New York
Times</i>, 10/23/02), adds further confirmation that the Bush Administration
was well aware of doubts about the meeting's occurrence even while selling it
as evidence of a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Unfortunately,
the British assessment was that the Bush Administration either did not
understand the strong possibility that such a complex post-war situation would
emerge, or did not engage in sufficient planning for such a contingency, or
both.  The July 21 memo states, "the US military plans are virtually silent"
about the possibility of a long nation-building operation.  The March 14 memo
from foreign policy advisor David Manning about his conversation with National
Security Advisor Rice says, "from what she said, Bush has yet to find the
answers to the big questions," including, "what happens on the morning after?" 
He further notes, "I think there is a real risk that the Administration
underestimates the difficulties.  They may agree that failure isn't an option,
but this does not mean that they will avoid it."  </span></p>

the Overseas and Defence Secretariat's March 8 "Options Paper" states that, for
a democratic regime replacing Saddam Hussein "to survive it would require the

operations in Iraq "could last six days, six weeks.  I doubt six months."

Congress.</span></b><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>  In the March 18 memo
recapping his conversation with Undersecretary Wolfowitz, British Ambassador
Meyer demonstrates a marked uneasiness about the close contact between the Bush
Administration and the Iraqi National Congress (INC), led by Ahmad Chalabi. 
Ambassador Meyer notes that Wolfowitz "said that he found himself between the
two sides (but as the conversation developed, it became clear that Wolfowitz
was far more pro-INC than not)."   Ambassador Meyer also reports Wolfowitz
being "strongly opposed" to any coalition excluding the INC, defending the INC
against concerns that it was infiltrated by Iraqi intelligence, and brushing
off those opposed to the coalition, including the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).  Finally, Ambassador Meyer notes that "Wolfowitz brushed over my
reference to the absence of Sunni in the INC."  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>As
has been well documented, the concerns expressed by Ambassador Meyer and others
about the INC proved to be well founded.  In the aftermath of Iraq's invasion,
Chalabi has been investigated for fraud, grand theft, and counterfeiting.  Even
more troubling are allegations that Chalabi leaked critical information about
U.S. intelligence operations to Iran.  The INC itself was found to have
provided the CIA, the Department of Defense, and Administration officials with
defectors who routinely lied, fabricated stories, and exaggerated the nature of
Iraq's threat to the United States in order to push the Bush Administration
toward war.  Admiral Lowell Jacoby, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
admitted to Congress that at least some of the intelligence provided by the INC
</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>"was either fabricated or embellished"</span><span
style='font-family:Helvetica'> (Senate Armed Services Committee, 3/9/04), and
the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation of pre-war intelligence was
sharply critical of a source provided by the INC, code-named "Curveball," who
provided inaccurate intelligence   Nevertheless, the Bush Administration paid
the INC over $1 million for flawed intelligence, and continued making payments
until May 2004 -- over a year after the war began and months after the
intelligence it provided had been called into serious question by the absence
of WMD in Iraq.  </span></p>

Administration preoccupied with military option for regime change, not
diplomatic solution to disarm Iraq.</span></b><span style='font-family:Helvetica'> 
The British memos demonstrate a clear preoccupation within the Bush
Administration with invading Iraq, already evident in March 2002.  British Foreign
Affairs advisor David Manning reported in his March 14 memo that, based on his
meeting with National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, "Condi's enthusiasm
for regime change is undimmed."  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's March 25 memo
likewise asserted that "most of the assessments from the US have assumed regime
change as a means of eliminating Iraq's WMD threat."  And the July 21 Cabinet
Office memo states that "the US Government's military planning for action
against Iraq is proceeding apace."  In fact, that memo presented military
action as a foregone conclusion, with timing dependent only on the length of
debate in Congress:  "although the US military could act against Iraq as soon
as November, we judged that a military campaign is unlikely to start until
January 2003, if only because of the time it will take to reach consensus in
Washington."   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>What
is striking about these statements and others in the memos, however, is not
just that they mention that the Bush Administration was focused on regime
change, it is that there an absolute absence of discussion about what the
Administration presented to the public as its main objective:  disarming Iraq
of its WMD.  In fact, the July 21 Cabinet Office memo drew attention to this
fact, stating, "US military planning unambiguously takes as its objective the
removal of Saddam Hussein's regime, followed by elimination [of] Iraqi WMD."  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>If
disarming Iraq of its WMD was the Administration primary objective, why would
regime change be the first goal of military planning?  More to the point, if it
were true that disarmament were the first objective, one would expect to see a
series of memos that questioned the best course of action to pursue this
objective, whether it be diplomatic, military, or otherwise.  Instead, the
memos are singularly focused on determining the best course of action to secure
regime change, and there is an assumption from the beginning that the best
course of action was, in fact, U.S. military invasion.  The centering of the
discussion in these seven memos on military action for the purpose of regime
change lends credence to the July 23 "Downing Street" memo's assertion that "m</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>ilitary action was now seen as inevitable... 
It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if
the timing was not yet decided."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:
Helvetica'>Finding</span></u></b><b><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>:  The diplomatic
process prior to invasion was used as a pretext for war, not as a genuine effort
to avoid sending U.S. troops into battle.</span></b><span style='font-family:
Helvetica'>  The memos clarify two additional questions about the Bush
Administration's commitment to diplomacy.  First, they make clear that the
Administration was not willing to pursue the diplomatic track long enough to
maximize chances for international support for military action and showed very
little concern for international participation at all.  Second, they reveal
that the British government invented the insertion of weapons inspectors prior
to the invasion as a pretext to legally justify British participation in the
U.S. war effort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Several
memos hint at the Bush Administration's disdain for diplomacy and international
cooperation.  The March 8 "Options Paper" states, "the US may be willing to
work with a much smaller coalition than we think desirable."  Ambassador
Meyer's March 18 memo recounts him telling Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, "the US
could go it alone if it wanted to.  But if it wanted to act with partners,
there had to be a strategy for building support for military action against
Saddam."  And Foreign Secretary Straw's March 25 memo states, "the US are
likely to oppose any idea of a fresh mandate" from the United Nations
sanctioning military action.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Even
more disturbing, the memos reveal that the insertion of weapons inspectors
prior to the invasion was only a pretext for war, not a good faith effort at
diplomacy.  The plan is stated most clearly in the July 21 Cabinet Office memo:
"it is just possible that an ultimatum could be cast in terms which Saddam
would reject (because he is unwilling to accept unfettered access) and which
would not be regarded as unreasonable by the international community.  However,
failing that (or an Iraqi attack) we would be most unlikely to achieve a legal
base for military action by January 2003."  Other memos make mention of this strategy
as well:  the March 14 memo from foreign policy advisor David Manning states
"[renewed refusal] by Saddam to accept unfettered inspections would be a
powerful argument," and the March 18 memo from Ambassador Meyer says, "I then
went through the need to wrongfoot Saddam on the inspectors."  These memos make
clear that the weapons inspections were not, as President Bush claimed, "one
last chance to disarm." (1/14/03)  Rather, they were simply a tool to weaken
international resistance to the military invasion of Iraq. </span></p>

pressure on the regime."  The July 21 Cabinet Office memo expresses concern
that such combative activities in the "No Fly Zones" could goad Saddam
