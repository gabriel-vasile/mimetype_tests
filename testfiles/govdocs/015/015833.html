<H1>BLAZEFORK SERIES </H1>
<BR>
The Blazefork series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium on floodplains in the Central Loess Plains (MLRA 75). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual air temperature is 54 degrees F (12 degrees C). <P>
