NWS SAN DIEGO CA<br>
 200 PM PST THU MAR 6 2008

.SYNOPSIS...DRY GENERALLY NORTHERLY FLOW PATTERN WILL PERSIST
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH WEAK OFFSHORE FLOW AT TIMES FOR
INLAND AREAS AND WEAK ONSHORE NEAR THE COAST BRINGING PATCHY LOW
CLOUDS AT TIMES.


&&

.DISCUSSION...FOR EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ORANGE...
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO
COUNTIES...

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
THE SPLITTING OF THE UPPER TROUGH MOVING TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA
COAST SHOWN IN RECENT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES MODELS ARE ON
TRACK WITH TAKING THIS TROUGH SOUTHEAST ALON THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
COAST TONIGHT AND DEVELOPING A CUTOFF LOW FRIDAY OFF THE SOUTHWEST
CALIFORNIA COAST WHICH CONTINUES TO SLIDE SOUTHEAST DOWN THE BAJA
CALIFORNIA COAST THROUGH SATURDAY. CIRRUS CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO
INCREASE FROM THE NORTHWEST THROUGH TONIGHT AS THE COL ALOFT
TRANSLATES ACROSS THE AREA...OTHERWISE AIR MASS REMAINS QUITE DRY.
WITH OFFSHORE FLOW INCREASING AGAIN FRIDAY DUE TO THE LOW MOVING
SOUTHEAST OFFSHORE...SEVERAL DEGREES OF WARMING ANTICIPATED OVER
TODAY WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS...DESPITE THE SLIGHTLY LOWER 1000-500 MB
THICKNESS VALUES.  SOME COOLING AND MOISTENING OVER COASTS AND
VALLEYS ON SATURDAY FROM RETURN OF ONSHORE FLOW AS UPPER LOW MOVES
FURTHER SOUTHEAST AND ANOTHER TROUGH MOVES INLAND ACROSS THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST REGION AND PUSHES A COLD FRONT INTO THE GREAT BASIN. THIS
ONSHORE FLOW QUICKLY REVERSES BACK TO OFFSHORE BY SUNDAY MORNING
FROM A BUILDING RIDGE ALOFT ALONG THE WEST COAST AND SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN.

&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY INTO THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND...
ONE MORE ROUND OF WEAK SANTA ANA WINDS DURING THIS PERIOD. THE ONE
THAT BEGINS ON SUNDAY WANES ON MONDAY AS THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
ALOFT AND THE SURFACE HIGH OVER THE GREAT BASIN SHIFT EASTWARD AND
BREAKDOWN DUE AS A STRONGER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST
REGION. THE 12Z RUNS OF THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DO NOT SHOWN ANY
PRECIPITATION FROM THIS TROUGH REACHING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT DO
INCREASE THE ONSHORE PRESSURE GRADIENTS SIGNIFICANTLY TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...6 TO 8 MB FROM THE COASTAL WATERS TO THE DESERTS...
AFTER THE TROUGH HAS DRAGGED ACROSS THE REGION. THIS SHOULD  CAUSE
GUSTY WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS...DESERTS...AND
COASTAL AND OFFSHORE WATERS...AND DEEPEN THE MARINE LAYER TUESDAY
NIGHT. STAYED WITH DEPTH AROUND 2100 FEET AND INCREASED LOW LAYER
SKY GRIDS TO REFLECT SCATTERED TO BROKEN STRATUS. THIS ONSHORE FLOW
IS A LITTLE SLOWER TO END AND MAY NOT FULLY VEER TO OFFSHORE ON
WEDNESDAY...BUT SHOULD DO SO BY THURSDAY. AFTER NEXT THURSDAY MODELS
ARE INDICATING A RETURN TO A WET PATTERN. NOT READY TO FULLY ACCEPT
THE MONSTER LOW COVERING THE ENTIRE WESTERN UNITED STATES THAT THE
GFS HAS ADVERTISED BY SUNDAY MARCH 16...BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING LIKE
AN END TO THE DRY PATTERN WE HAVE BEEN IN FOR TWO WEEKS BY THEN.

&&

.AVIATION...
061915Z...<b>MDCRS</b> SOUNDINGS NEAR KSNA SHOW THE MARINE LAYER DEPTH
AROUND 300 FEET. EXPECT SOME DEEPENING THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT
BUT THE DEPTH SHOULD REMAIN 1000 FEET OR LESS. SOME FOG COULD REFORM
ALONG THE COAST AND LOCALLY INTO COASTAL VALLEYS TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY
MORNING BUT ANY FOG SHOULD DISSIPATE BY 16Z ON FRIDAY.

ABOVE THE MARINE LAYER...VARIABLE CLOUDS AT OR ABOVE FL250 SHOULD
LOWER TO AROUND 15000 FEET TONIGHT. OTHERWISE OFFSHORE FLOW WILL
BRING UNRESTRICTED CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES THROUGH FRIDAY.  HORTON

ONSHORE NEAR THE COAST BRINGING PATCHY LOW CLOUDS AT TIMES.

&&

.DISCUSSION...FOR EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ORANGE...
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO
COUNTIES...

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
THE 1200 UTC SOUNDING FROM KNKX WAS TOO MOIST...POSSIBLE
MALFUNCTIONING HYGRISTOR ELEMENT...COMPARED WITH ADJACENT
SOUNDINGS...CONTINUED SUBSIDENCE ALOFT...AND NO MOISTURE
ADVECTION...YET. ALSO RAWS MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS SHOWED DEWPOINT DROPS
OF 15 TO 35 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT DURING PAST 24 HOURS. NCEP SAID
QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS CAUGHT THIS BEFORE DATA GOT INTO MODEL RUNS.
SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA STILL UNDER WEAK SANTA ANA PATTERN TODAY. THE
UPPER SUPPORT AND SUBSIDENCE ALOFT PEAKED THIS MORNING BASED ON THE
EXITING 100 KT NORTHERLY JET STREAK IN THE 30000-40000 FT LAYER AND
THE DRYING SHOWN ON THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. THE MODELS FIRST GUESS
ON THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN IS ABOUT 5 TO 7 MB TOO STRONG OVER
THE GREAT BASIN BUT STILL GETTING GUSTS IN THE 28 TO 42 MPH RANGE IN
THE WIND PRONE LOCATIONS THIS MORNING AND THE MARINE LAYER IS LESS
THAN 500 FEET NOW. THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS IS BEING NUDGED EASTWARD IN
RESPONSE TO WEAK TROUGH MOVING TOWARDS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. MODELS
ARE STILL IN AGREEMENT IN SLIDING THE TROUGH SOUTHEAST
TONIGHT/FRIDAY AND DEVELOPING A CUTOFF LOW OFF THE SW CALIFORNIA
COAST WHICH THEN CONTINUES TO SLIDE SOUTHEAST DOWN THE BAJA
CALIFORNIA COAST THROUGH SATURDAY. CIRRUS CLOUDS INCREASING FROM THE
NORTHWEST TODAY/TONIGHT AS COL ALOFT TRANSLATES ACROSS THE
AREA...OTHERWISE AIR MASS REMAIN QUITE DRY AND WARM THROUGH FRIDAY
WITH SOME MINOR COOLING AND MOISTENING OVER COASTS AND VALLEYS ON
SATURDAY FROM INCREASE IN ONSHORE FLOW...HOWEVER MARINE LAYER DEPTH
EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW 1500 FEET WITH THE MEAN LAYER RELATIVE
HUMIDITY AT LESS THAN 60 PERCENT SO SIGNIFICANT LOW CLOUDS.

&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
CONTINUED DRY SUNDAY WITH RIDGE ALOFT REBUILDING. THE RIDGE BREAKS

NWS SAN DIEGO CA<br>
 410 AM PST WED MAR 5 2008

.SYNOPSIS...
GENERALLY NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN WILL BRING DRY...MOSTLY FAIR
WEATHER THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH PATCHY LOW CLOUDS NEAR THE
COAST AT TIMES AND BRIEF PERIODS OF GUSTY OFFSHORE WINDS FOR INLAND
AREAS.

&&

.DISCUSSION...FOR EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ORANGE...
SAN DIEGO...WESTERN RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHWESTERN SAN BERNARDINO
COUNTIES...

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE COASTAL WATERS WILL
BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDS EARLY THIS MORNING. PATCHY STRATUS HAS ALSO
RETURNED FROM THE COAST INLAND TO THE LOWER COASTAL VALLEYS BENEATH
AN INVERSION NEAR 1500 FEET. A STRONGER SHORTWAVE IS ALSO PASSING
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE GREAT BASIN AND THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES
TODAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN AND NORTH FLOW
ALOFT BEHIND THIS SHORTWAVE WILL BRING GUSTY OFFSHORE WINDS TO
NORTHERN AREAS FOR MID MORNING THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON WITH A WIND
ADVISORY POSTED FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS
AND FOOTHILLS FROM 8 AM TO 2 PM TODAY. OTHERWISE...A DRY NORTHWEST
FLOW PATTERN WILL PERSIST TROUGH FRIDAY. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVING
SOUTHEASTWARD IN THIS PATTERN THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY COULD
BRING COME MORE HIGH CLOUDS. WILL LEAVE STRATUS OUT FOR NOW...BUT
SOME PATCHY RETURN IS ALSO POSSIBLE FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY
FRIDAY.

&&

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL CONTINUE FAIR...DRY WEATHER THROUGH MONDAY
WITH A RETURN OF THE MARINE LAYER POSSIBLE FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.
FOR TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...MODELS ARE TRENDING FARTHER NORTH WITH
A SHORTWAVE MOVING INLAND ALONG THE WEST COAST. WHILE THIS WOULD
STILL BRING COOLING AND SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS...THE MORE NORTHERN
TRACK WOULD KEEP PRECIPITATION TO THE NORTH OF SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA.

&&

.AVIATION...
051030Z...LATEST OBSERVATIONS AND <b>ACARS</b> SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THE MARINE
LAYER IS NEAR 1500 FT DEEP. STRATUS COVERAGE REMAINS PATCHY THIS
MORNING WITH CIGS CONFINED TO THE COAST AND SOME INLAND VALLEYS OF
SAN DIEGO COUNTY. EXPECT PATCHY MVFR/IFR CIGS AND VIS RESTRICTIONS
ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST AND SAN DIEGO VALLEYS TO CONTINUE THROUGH
17Z...THEN ANY LINGERING CIGS SHOULD BECOME SCATTERED WITH COASTAL
AREAS RETURNING TO VFR FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

LOCALLY GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS WILL DEVELOP IN AND BELOW MOUNTAIN
PASSES AND CANYONS NEAR KONT BY 14Z AND SPREAD INTO SAN DIEGO CO
AFTER 18Z... PRODUCING AREAS OF MODERATE TURBULENCE...UP/DOWNDRAFTS
AND LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR.

ABOVE THE MARINE LAYER...VFR CONDITIONS WITH UNRESTRICTED CEILINGS
AND VISIBILITY WILL PREVAIL...WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS AT TIMES.

&&

.SGX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

 930 PM PST TUE MAR 4 2008

.SYNOPSIS...A SHALLOW MARINE LAYER WILL CAUSE AREAS OF COASTAL LOW
CLOUDS AND FOG DURING THE NIGHTS AND MORNINGS. OTHERWISE...HIGH
PRESSURE WILL KEEP THE WEATHER FAIR THIS WEEK. UPPER LEVEL LOW
PRESSURE WILL BRING MORE CLOUDS AND COOLING EARLY NEXT WEEK.

&&

.DISCUSSION...FOR SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA INCLUDING SAN DIEGO...
ORANGE...SOUTHWEST SAN BERNARDINO AND WEST RIVERSIDE COUNTIES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT-FRI)...SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR THIS EVENING
EXCEPT FOR A FEW HIGH CLOUDS AND PATCHY STRATUS OFFSHORE AND NEAR
THE SAN DIEGO COAST. THE 00Z NKX SOUNDING SHOWED THE HIGH LEVEL
MOISTURE IN NW WINDS ALOFT. WEAK ONSHORE GRADIENTS.

A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL SHIFT SLOWLY INLAND THROUGH
FRI. AT THE SAME TIME...A WEAK UPPER LOW WILL UNDERCUT THE RIDGE
BRINGING MORE HIGH CLOUDS THU. A SHALLOW MARINE LAYER AND A WEAK
EDDY WILL CAUSE AREAS OF COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND FOG TONIGHT AND WED
MORNING. THE MARINE LAYER WILL BE SHALLOW ENOUGH FOR PATCHY DENSE
FOG SLIGHTLY INLAND FROM THE IMMEDIATE COAST. BRIEF OFFSHORE FLOW
WILL CAUSE LOCAL GUSTY WINDS...MAINLY BELOW THE CAJON PASS AND INTO
THE SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS WED MORNING. WEAK GRADIENTS WILL MAINTAIN
WEAK OFFSHORE DRIFT AT NIGHT WITH ONSHORE SEA BREEZES IN THE
AFTERNOONS THU AND FRI. A SHALLOW MARINE LAYER SHOULD PERSIST
THROUGH FRIDAY FOR PATCHY COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND FOG DURING THE
NIGHTS AND MORNINGS. SLIGHT LOCAL COOLING IN MOST AREAS WED FROM A
WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING S ALONG THE E SIDE OF THE RIDGE. A LITTLE
WARMER THU AND FRI.

&&

.LONG TERM (SAT-TUE)...MINOR CHANGES INTO SAT. EXTENDED PROGS REMAIN
INCONSISTENT ON THE DETAILS EARLY NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER LOW SHOULD
MOSTLY MOVE PAST TO THE N EARLY NEXT WEEK BRINING MORE CLOUDS AND
COOLING. THERE COULD BE A LITTLE PRECIP TOWARD LATE TUE BUT CHANCES
ARE TOO SMALL AND UNCERTAINTY TOO LARGE TO MENTION IN THE ZONES THAT
FAR OUT.

&&

.AVIATION...
050422Z...CONFIDENCE LOW REGARDING CIGS/VIS FOR COASTAL AIRPORTS
TONIGHT AND EARLY WED AS A SHALLOW MOIST LAYER OFF THE PACIFIC
FLIRTS WITH THE COAST. PRESSURE GRADIENTS ARE WEAK...AND IT HAS BEEN
HARD TO DEFINE A TREND ON SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH 04Z. LATEST
OBSERVATIONS AND <b>ACARS</b> SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THE MARINE LAYER IS NEAR
1200 FT DEEP OVER COASTAL SAN DIEGO COUNTY...BIT CONSIDERABLY MORE
SHALLOW TO THE NORTH. EXPECT SOME BROKEN IFR CIGS AND VIS
RESTRICTIONS AT THE IMMEDIATE COAST...BUT FEEL DENSITY GRADIENTS AND
AN OVER ALL TREND FOR SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS TO BECOME OFFSHORE
TOWARD MORNING WILL LIMIT MUCH INLAND PENETRATION. AFTER 17Z ANY
LINGERING CIGS SHOULD BECOME SCATTERED WITH COASTAL AREAS RETURNING
TO VFR FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

ON WEDNESDAY...LOCALLY GUSTY OFFSHORE NORTHEAST WINDS WILL DEVELOP
NEAR THE MOUNTAIN PASSES AND CANYONS...BUT WEAKER THAN THE RECENT
OFFSHORE WINDS FROM SUNDAY/MON. THE GUSTY WINDS SHOULD DEVELOP NEAR
CAJON PASS BY 14Z WED AND SPREAD INTO SAN DIEGO CO BY 18Z...
PRODUCING AREAS OF MODERATE TURBULENCE...UP/DOWNDRAFTS AND LOW LEVEL
WIND SHEAR.

ABOVE THE MARINE LAYER...VFR CONDITIONS WITH UNRESTRICTED CEILINGS
AND VISIBILITY WILL PREVAIL...WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS AT TIMES.

MAIN FCST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE ARE SN CHCS/AMTS TDAY ASSOCIATED

FOR TDAY...SHRTWV NOW OVER NRN MN FCST BY NAM/GFS TO SHEAR OUT TO

MOISTENING THRU THE DAY...SO PREFER THE HIER NAM MOS POPS...
ESPECIALLY GIVEN FAIRLY WDSPRD NATURE OF SN NOW IN SW MN THAT SHOULD
OVERSPREAD THE FA W-E. WL CARRY LOWER CHC POPS OVER THE E/SE BECAUSE
BETTER UPR DYNAMICS EXIT AFT 18-21Z AND WHERE GFS FCST SDNGS SHOW
MORE RESILIENT LLVL DRY AIR. OTRW...ARRIVAL OF ARCTIC COLD FNT LATE

DEEP MSTR DEPARTING ONLY SLOWLY AHEAD OF THE FROPA. SO SCT -SHSN WL
CONTINUE THRU THE EVNG ACRS THE ENTIRE FA AND UNTIL FROPA. FOLLOWING
THE FROPA...ACTIVITY WL TRANSITION TO PURE LES IN THE NW WIND SN
BELTS AND TEND TO END ELSEWHERE AS LLVLS WITHIN THE ARCTIC AIRMASS
ARE QUITE DRY. THERE COULD BE A PD OF ENHANCED SN IN THE EVNG OVER
THE W AS FNT ARRIVES WHILE GFS FCST SHOW MSTR EXTENDING TO H75. IN
THE PURE LES REGIME THAT FOLLOWS THE DEPARTURE OF THE MSTR...LES
CHART SUGS 3-6"/12HRS. BUT DRY NATURE OF AIRMASS...DCRSG SN GROWTH

CHART FCST. THERE MAY ALSO BE A BRIEF PD OF LK ENHANCED SN OVER THE
E IN THE NW SN BELTS WITH ARRIVAL OF THE FNT BEFORE DEPARTURE OF
DEEP MSTR...BUT THIS WL BE LATE.

AS ARCTIC BRANCH TROF AMPLIFIES INTO THE GRT LKS DURING THE LATE
WEEK PD...COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUOUSLY POUR INTO THE FA...GENERATING
LES. GFS/UKMET SHOW H85 TEMPS VARYING FM -20C AT ERY TO -24C AT IWD
AT 00Z FRI. GFS SHOWS H85 TEMPS BOTTOMING OUT AS LO AS -28C OVER THE
W AT 12Z FRI...BUT UKMET IS A BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE WITH -26C.
ALTHOUGH THESE MODELS SHOW THE LLVL FLOW VEERING MORE NNW WITH TIME
AS THE ARCTIC HI PRES CENTER REACHES SRN MN BY 00Z SAT...EXPECT THIS
LES EVENT TO BE PREDOMINANTLY A NW SN BELTS EVENT. OTRW...DRYNESS OF
AIRMASS...INCRSGLY NEGATIVE SN GROWTH WITH ARRIVAL OF EVER COLDER
AIR...SFC HTG OVER LAND DURING THE DAY...AND LOWERING INVRN BASE WL

3"/12 HRS SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR EXPECTED CONDITIONS. THERE MAY BE A
PD OF SOMEWHAT HEAVIER LES THU EVNG AS GFS/UKMET SHOW A REINFORCING
SHRTWV SWINGING THRU THE UPR LKS...WITH FCST INVRN BASE ON GFS FCST
SDNGS RISING TO ARND 7K FT AT CMX WITH SOME MID LVL MOISTENING.

GFS IS THE MOST PROGRESSIVE WITH BLDG SFC RDG INTO THE UPR LKS ON
SAT...BUT 00Z CNDN/ECMWF SHOW MORE UPR TROF AMPLIFICATION AND THE
RETURN OF A MORE NLY CYC FLOW ON THE WRN FLANK OF DEEPENING LO OVER

AS FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO LOWER GOING FCST HI TEMPS A FEW DEGREES TO
MATCH MIXING TO H85 ON GFS FCST SDNGS. ALSO LOWERED FCST MIN TEMPS
OVER THE INTERIOR W HALF THRU THE FCST WITH EXPECTATION OF MORE WNW
FLOW/LESS LK MODIFICATION. TEMPS LOOK LO ENUF THU NGT TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT WIND CHILL HEADLINES WITH ARRIVAL OF H85 THERMAL
TROF...BUT WIND SPEEDS MAY NOT BE HI ENUF TO JUSTIFY A HEADLINE
WHERE TEMPS WL BE LOWEST OVER THE INTERIOR W HALF.

.AVIATION (FOR THE 12Z TAF ISSUANCE)...

OBS OVER WISCONSIN SUGGEST IFR VISBILILITIES AND CEILINGS WITH THE
STEADY SNOW IMMEDIATLY BEHIND THE FRONT. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE AT
CMX AFTER FROPA. NAM SEEMS TOO FAST BRINING IN PCPN WITH DRY AIR IN
PLACE AND HAVE OPTED TO KEEP TIMING SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS FORECASTS
WITH TEMPORARY IFR CONDITIONS AT CMX BY LATE MORNING WITH 2SM
VISIBILITY...ALTHOUGH IF THE SNOW GRAINS ARE FINE VISIBILITIES COULD
BRIEFLY DROP TO 1SM. WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE AND DIMINISHING UPPER
MOTION AS THE FRONT MOVES EAST...IT IS UNCLEAR IF SAW WILL SEE SNOW
ESPECIALLY WITH WESTERLY FLOW. REGARDLESS...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
SHOULD BRING MVFR CIGS TO SAW IF NOTHING ELSE. COLDER AIR GRADUALLY

DEEP MSTR DEPARTING ONLY SLOWLY AHEAD OF THE FROPA. SO SCT -SHSN WL
CONTINUE THRU THE EVNG ACRS THE ENTIRE FA AND UNTIL FROPA. FOLLOWING
THE FROPA...ACTIVITY WL TRANSITION TO PURE LES IN THE NW WIND SN
BELTS AND TEND TO END ELSEWHERE AS LLVLS WITHIN THE ARCTIC AIRMASS
ARE QUITE DRY. THERE COULD BE A PD OF ENHANCED SN IN THE EVNG OVER

DEEP MSTR...BUT THIS WL BE LATE.

AS ARCTIC BRANCH TROF AMPLIFIES INTO THE GRT LKS DURING THE LATE
WEEK PD...COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUOUSLY POUR INTO THE FA...GENERATING
LES. GFS/UKMET SHOW H85 TEMPS VARYING FM -20C AT ERY TO -24C AT IWD

ALTHOUGH THESE MODELS SHOW THE LLVL FLOW VEERING MORE NNW WITH TIME
AS THE ARCTIC HI PRES CENTER REACHES SRN MN BY 00Z SAT...EXPECT THIS
LES EVENT TO BE PREDOMINANTLY A NW SN BELTS EVENT. OTRW...DRYNESS OF
AIRMASS...INCRSGLY NEGATIVE SN GROWTH WITH ARRIVAL OF EVER COLDER

TEND TO LIMIT SN AMTS BLO THAT SUGGESTED BY LES CHART...GOING UP TO
3"/12 HRS SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR EXPECTED CONDITIONS. THERE MAY BE A

AS FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO LOWER GOING FCST HI TEMPS A FEW DEGREES TO
MATCH MIXING TO H85 ON GFS FCST SDNGS. ALSO LOWERED FCST MIN TEMPS
OVER THE INTERIOR W HALF THRU THE FCST WITH EXPECTATION OF MORE WNW
FLOW/LESS LK MODIFICATION. TEMPS LOOK LO ENUF THU NGT TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT WIND CHILL HEADLINES WITH ARRIVAL OF H85 THERMAL

.AVIATION (FOR THE 06Z TAF ISSUANCE)...

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE GOING AVIATION FORECAST. OBS OVER MN SUGGEST
IFR VSBYS AND CIGS WITH THE STEADY SNOW IMMEDIATLY BEHIND THE FRONT.
THIS SEEMS REASONABLE AT CMX AFTER FROPA. NAM SEEMS TOO FAST BRINING
IN PCPN WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE AND HAVE OPTED TO KEEP TIMING SIMILAR
TO PREVIOUS FCSTS WITH TEMPORARY IFR CONDITIONS AT CMX BY LATE
MORNING WITH 2SM VSBY...ALTHOUGH IF THE SNOW GRAINS ARE FINE VSBYS
COULD BRIEFLY DROP TO 1SM. WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE AND DIMINISHING
UPPER MOTION AS THE FRONT MOVES EAST...IT IS UNCLEAR IF SAW WILL SEE
SNOW ESPECIALLY WITH WESTERLY FLOW. REGARDLESS...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
SHOULD BRING MVFR CIGS TO SAW IF NOTHING ELSE. COLDER AIR GRADUALLY
MOVES IN WED EVENING AND SOME LAKE EFFECT SHOULD DEVELOP AT CMX IN
THE W-NW FLOW.

NWS MARQUETTE MI<br>
 1130 PM EST TUE MAR 4 2008

.UPDATE...
NO MAJOR CHANGES ARE PLANNED IN THE UPDATE. LATEST REGIONAL RADAR
LOOP AND OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT LIGHT SNOW CONTINUES TO SPREAD
EAST ACROSS NORTHERN MN AHEAD OF THE WEAKENING COLD FRONT. SNOW
STILL WELL WEST OF DULUTH...AND THE MOVEMENT EAST CONTINUES TO BE
SOMEWHAT SLOW. AM NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE DYNAMICS AND LIFT WITH
THE SYSTEM AT THIS TIME...HOWEVER THERE MAY BE A LITTLE ENHANCEMENT
WED MORNING AS THE UPPER JET BACKBUILDS AND STRENGTHENS...LEADING TO
A BRIEF PERIOD OF ENHANCED UPPER DIVERGENCE AND ASSOCIATED UPWARD
MOTION ACROSS WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN JUXTAPOSED WITH THE MOISTURE
AND LOW LEVEL LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONTAL ZONE. IT WILL PROBABLY
TAKE A LITTLE TIME FOR SNOW TO DEVELOP IN FAR WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN
DUE TO THE DRY LOW LEVEL AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION. HOWEVER...ONCE
IT DOES EXPECT A PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON ACROSS
WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN. WILL THEREFORE KEEP LIKELY POPS ON WED
ACROSS WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN AND TAPERING TO CHANCE POPS INTO
CENTRAL UPPER MICHIGAN...THEN DRY ACROSS THE EAST.

OTHERWISE...FCST TEMPS MAY BE A LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE WITH THE
CLOUDS AND HAVE ADJUSTED UPWARD SLIGHTLY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE
WEST. EASTERN UPPER MICHIGAN MAY SEE FCST LOWS AND HAVE NOT ADJUSTED
THAT AREA MUCH.

&&

.SYNOPSIS...

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A TROF DOMINATING MUCH OF
NAMERICA. TROF IS ANCHORED BY A POLAR VORTEX OVER NORTHERN HUDSON
BAY. IN THE BROAD CYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE CONUS...A SHORTWAVE/CLOSED
MIDLEVEL LOW IS LIFTING NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WHILE ANOTHER
SHORTWAVE TROF IS DROPPING SE THRU THE ROCKIES. A WEAKER SHORTWAVE
OVER ND/NW MN IS SUPPORTING SOME -SN OVER NW MN IN ASSOCIATED
WAA/ISENTROPIC ASCENT REGIME. CLOSER TO HOME...CONVERGENCE ZONE
SWEEPING E ACROSS ERN LAKE SUPERIOR IS PRODUCING SOME -SN/FLURRIES
FROM NEAR MARQUETTE N TO STANNARD ROCK. FLURRIES SHOULD AFFECT AREAS
FROM NRN MARQUETTE COUNTY TO THE KEWEENAW THRU ABOUT 00Z.

&&

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WED)...

SHORTWAVE OVER NE ND/NW MN WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES ENE TONIGHT.
ASSOCIATED ISENTROPIC ASCENT REGIME AHEAD OF IT ALSO WEAKENS WITH
FOCUS SHIFTING NE TO THE N OF THE FCST AREA. GIVEN THE DRY AIRMASS
OVER THE FCST AREA PER AFTN T<b>AMDAR</b> SOUNDINGS FROM KSAW/KCMX...SFC
HIGH PRES RIDGE LINGERING ACROSS UPPER MI...AND INDICATION OF ASCENT
WEAKENING...HAVE PUSHED BACK TIMING OF CHC POPS FOR -SN TO LATE
TONIGHT AND ALSO TRIMMED BACK EASTWARD EXTENT TO JUST
ONTONAGON/GOGEBIC COUNTIES. AS FOR TEMPS...SINCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR
THAT A SOLID CLOUD DECK WILL BE THE RULE FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT...
THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DECENT COOLING WITH SFC HIGH PRES
RIDGE OVER THE FCST AREA. NOT SURE TEMPS WILL FALL BLO ZERO AS GFS
MOS GUIDANCE INDICATES OVER SOME OF THE INTERIOR...BUT READINGS
SHOULD FALL INTO THE LWR SINGLE DIGITS.

SFC LOW PRES TROF WILL SLOWLY DRIFT E TO LAKE SUPERIOR/UPPER MI WED.
FORCING REALLY IS QUITE WEAK...SO NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF
SNOW. EVEN SO...OPTED FOR LIKELY POPS OVER PORTIONS OF THE W ALONG
SLOW MOVING TROF...BUT SNOW WILL BE LIGHT (ACCUMULATIONS UNDER 1
INCH). DUE TO THE WEAK FORCING...ALSO CONTINUED TO DELAY ONSET OF
CHC POPS FARTHER E...INLINE WITH SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESS TONIGHT.
IN FACT...DECIDED TO KEEP THE ERN FCST AREA DRY THRU THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...

WED NIGHT INTO THU...

THE NAM AND GFS DEPICT WEAK TO MODERATE 800-600 QVECTOR CONV AND
FGEN AHEAD OF THE MID LEVEL TROUGH WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT
POTENTIAL FOR AREAS OF LIGHT SNOW. THE WEAK SYNOPTIC SCALE UPWARD
MOTION AND LINGERING DEEP MOISTURE COMBINED ALONG WITH CAA
DROPPING 850 MB TEMPS FROM AROUND -13C TO -19C WILL BRING INCREASING
CHANCE FOR LAKE EFFECT SNOW OVERNIGHT OVER THE NW CWA. H8 TEMPS
FALLING TO -18C TO 23C WILL SUPPORT LES GOING THU FOR ALL AREAS
FAVORED BY NW FLOW BUT THE INFLUX OF DRY ARCTIC AIR AND DEPARTURE OF
DEEPER MOISTURE...SHOULD KEEP ACCUMULATIONS GENERALLY LIGHT...1-3
INCHES PER 12 HOURS. SHORTER FETCH AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL ICE COVER
OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR WILL FURTHER REDUCE ACCUMULATION POTENTIAL
INTO NW UPPER MI.

THU NIGHT AND FRI...NW FLOW LES WILL CONTINUE BUT DRY ARCTIC AIR
WITH  850 MB TEMPS FALLING INTO THE -23C TO -28C RANGE WILL NOT BE
FAVORABLE FOR DECENT SNOWFLAKE GROWTH. SO...ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS
SHOULD REMAIN AOB ADVY LEVELS...STILL IN THE 1-3 INCH/12 HOUR RANGE.

FRI NIGHT...DIMINISHING WINDS MAY LEAD TO FORMATION OF MESO-LOW OR
ISOLATED DOMINANT BANDS THAT COULD BRING LCLY HIGHER SNOWFALL
RATES/AMOUNTS TO LOCATIONS NEAR THE SHORELINE IN ALGER COUNTY.

SAT-TUE...UNCERTAINTY INCREASES AS MODEL DIFFERENCES EMERGE IN
HANDLING SPEED OF LONG WAVE PROGRESSION AND POTENTIAL FOR SHORTWAVES
AFFECTING THE AREA IN NW FLOW BY SUN. FCST GENERALLY LEANED TOWARD
THE 00Z ECMWF/CANADIAN GLBL...PER HPC. HOWEVER WITH TRENDS TOWARD A
FASTER PROGRESSION OF THE MID LEVEL TROF...PER 12Z ECMWF AND 12Z
GFS...THERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SNOW EITHER WITH A
CLIPPER SHORTWAVE OR FOR SOME LES BEHIND ANY CLIPPER SYSTEM. WITH
LIMITED MOISTURE AND MARGINAL TEMPS FOR LES...ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
WOULD BE LIGHT. A WARMING TREND STILL LOOKS ON TRACK FOR EARLY NEXT
WEEK WITH WAA PATTERN AND RISING HEIGHTS AS MID LEVEL RIDGING FROM
THE EXPANDS EASTWARD AND A MORE ZONAL PATTERN DEVELOPS.

&&

.AVIATION (FOR THE 06Z TAF ISSUANCE)...

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE GOING AVIATION FORECAST. OBS OVER MN SUGGEST
IFR VSBYS AND CIGS WITH THE STEADY SNOW IMMEDIATLY BEHIND THE FRONT.
THIS SEEMS REASONABLE AT CMX AFTER FROPA. NAM SEEMS TOO FAST BRINING
IN PCPN WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE AND HAVE OPTED TO KEEP TIMING SIMILAR

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION<br>
NWS BUFFALO NY<br>
 1203 AM EST WED MAR 5 2008

.SYNOPSIS...
AN ICY MIX WILL CONTINUE TO FALL ACROSS ALL OF WESTERN AND NORTH
CENTRAL NEW YORK OVERNIGHT...WITH WINTER STORM WARNINGS REMAINING
IN EFFECT. WHILE POWER OUTAGES WERE SPOTTY AS OF THE WRITING OF
THIS DISCUSSION...MORE WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES ARE EXPECTED
OVERNIGHT. DRIER WEATHER WILL RETURN LATER WEDNESDAY INTO
THURSDAY.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN HAVE BEEN FALLING ACROSS ALL OF WESTERN
NEW YORK SINCE NIGHTFALL...WITH ICE ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH 1000 PM
GENERALLY RANGING FROM A TENTH TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF AN INCH.

THE 00Z KBUF SOUNDING IS VERY SIMILAR TO NEARLY A DOZEN <b>AIRCRAFT</b>
SOUNDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN EXAMINED FROM ACROSS WESTERN NEW YORK
THIS EVENING. A FAIRLY DEEP...5 TO 7K FOOT DEEP LAYER OF +0C AIR
IS SHOWN ON THE AREA SOUNDINGS WITH THE `WARM LAYER` EXTENDING
FROM ABOUT H85 TO H70.

A 50-60KT JET BELOW H7 HAS HELPED TO PUSH THIS WARM TONGUE ALL THE
WAY TO THE NORTH COUNTRY...AND WILL KEEP THE WARM LAYER IN PLACE
THROUGH THE NIGHT. AS A RESULT...THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PCPN FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE OVERNIGHT WILL FALL AS ZR- WITH ONLY A SMALL
PERCENTAGE EXPECTED TO FALL AS SLEET.

IN TERMS OF QPF...STRONG UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE HAS ENABLED PCPN
TO BLOSSOM ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE PAST HOUR OR TWO. THIS
STEADY PCPN WILL MOVE ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT WITH THE
STRONGEST AREA OF UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE MOVING ACROSS OUR REGION.
USING RADAR QPF ESTIMATES AND RUC13 PCPN FORECASTS...AM EXPECTING
THE BULK OF OUR FORECAST AREA TO PICK UP ANOTHER ONE HALF OF AN
INCH OF PCPN. GIVEN THE INTENSITY OF THE RAINFALL... WOULD EXPECT
LESS THAN HALF OF THIS TO `STICK` AS FREEZING RAIN ON WIRES AND
TREES.

NEVERTHELESS...ANOTHER QUARTER INCH OR SO OF ICE ON TOP OF THE
ALREADY ICE ACCUMULATION WILL LEAD TO MORE WIDESPREAD POWER
OUTAGES. TRAVEL CONDITIONS ON UNTREATED SECONDARY ROADS WILL
LIKELY BE TREACHEROUS THROUGH DAYBREAK.

AM STILL EXPECTING THE ICY PCPN TO START TO DIMINISH IN COVERAGE
AND INTENSITY FROM THE SOUTHWEST AFTER ABOUT 08Z...WITH LEFTOVER
PCPN THEN CHANGING OVER TO LIGHT SNOW AROUND DAYBREAK IN THE FAR
WEST.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY/...
PRECIPITATION SHOULD WIND DOWN WEDNESDAY MORNING. THERE MAY BE A
BURST OF BACKWASH SNOW...MAYBE 1 TO 2 INCHES FOR A FEW HOURS IN
MID-LATE MORNING...THEN WILL LOWER POPS IN AFTERNOON. THURS LOOKS
TRANQUIL...WEAK TROF LOOKS VERY MINOR NOW...WILL HOLD LOW CHC 30
POP FOR R/S SHOWER. MODELS DEVELOPING A COASTAL LOW LATER
FRI...CLOSE ENOUGH TO INCR OUR POPS TO LIKELY FOR SNOW FOR THE
AFTERNOON. COULD SEE SOME ACCUM BUT DOESNT LOOK MAJOR AT THIS
TIME.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
IN GENERAL...THE MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THAT
LARGE SCALE TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY OVER THE
WEEKEND WILL GRADUALLY TRANSITION TO MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW EARLY NEXT
WEEK.

THE ABOVE SAID...THE VARIOUS MODELS ALSO CONTINUE TO SHOW
CONSIDERABLE DISAGREEMENT BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERALL TIMING OF
THIS CHANGE...AND THE CORRESPONDING EVOLUTION OF THE SMALLER-SCALE
FEATURES. GIVEN THE RATHER DEGREE OF DISCREPANCIES THAT
REMAINS...CONFIDENCE IN THIS PERIOD IS LOW AND AS SUCH HAVE
CONTINUED TO LEAN MORE TOWARD FORECAST CONTINUITY AND HPC
GUIDANCE...WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE
GUIDANCE ENVELOPE AND AWAY FROM THE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER 06Z/12Z GFS
AND SLOWER 00Z ECMWF SOLUTIONS.

IN TERMS OF THE FORECAST DETAILS...A SURFACE LOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE
AFOREMENTIONED UPPER TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NORTHWARD ALONG OR A
BIT INLAND OF THE ATLANTIC COAST EARLY IN THE PERIOD...BRINGING THE
LIKELIHOOD OF A GENERAL SYNOPTIC SNOWFALL FRIDAY NIGHT INTO
SATURDAY...PARTICULARLY ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY COLDER THAN NORMAL CONDITIONS AND A
GENERAL CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS PERSISTING FROM LATER SATURDAY
INTO SUNDAY...THEN BROAD SURFACE RIDGING WILL BRING A RETURN TO
DRIER WEATHER MONDAY AND TUESDAY ALONG WITH TEMPERATURES MODERATING
BACK TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS.

&&

.AVIATION /05Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A STRONG LATE WINTER STORM OVER SOUTHERN PENNSYLVANIA WILL LIFT
NORTHEAST TO BGM AROUND 12Z AND THEN TO VERMONT BY 18Z AND TO
NORTHERN MAINE BY 00Z THURSDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT
ICING TO THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH MAINLY FREEZING RAIN AND
SLEET. THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE MODERATE AT TIMES WITH UP TO A HALF
TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH OF ICE ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. THIS WILL
HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON AVIATION OPERATIONS THROUGH THE NIGHT.
CONDITIONS WILL BE LOWERING TO MAINLY IFR FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT WITH
LIFR/IFR CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER. THE PRECIPITATION IS
EXPECTED TO CHANGE BACK TO SNOW BETWEEN 10 AND 12Z ACROSS AREAS FROM
THE FINGER LAKES WEST AND BY 15Z ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY WITH MVFR
TO IFR CIGS IMPROVING TO MVFR CIGS BY 15Z-17Z. BY AROUND 00Z
CONDITIONS SHLD BECOME VFR IN THE WEST, 03Z IN THE ROC AREA AND BY
04Z ACROSS THE NORTH COUNTRY.

OUTLOOK...
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...MVFR CONDITIONS IMPROVING TO VFR AS WEAK RIDGING
BUILDS ACROSS THE AREA.
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER LOW MOVING FROM THE GREAT
LAKES ACROSS ONTARIO WILL LIKELY BRING A RISK OF MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS
IN SNOW SHOWERS.
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST
COAST WILL BRING A RISK OF IFR CONDITIONS IN SNOW.
SATURDAY...RIDGING BUILDING BACK ACROSS THE AREA WITH VFR CONDITIONS.
SUNDAY...ANOTHER WEAK LOW MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL BRING A
RISK OF SNOW SHOWERS AND MVFR CONDITIONS.

&&

.MARINE...
A GALE WARNING WILL BE CONTINUED FOR LAKE ONTARIO TONIGHT AS STRONG
LOW PRESSURE LIFTS FROM KENTUCKY ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL NEW YORK
STATE...AND RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION OF THE LOW-LEVEL
NORTHEAST FLOW ACROSS THE LAKE. AT THIS POINT...GALES TO NEAR 40
KNOTS APPEAR LIKELY AT THE PEAK OF THE WINDS...WITH GUSTS
APPROACHING OR REACHING STORM FORCE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

WINDS WILL DIMINISH RATHER QUICKLY LATER TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
MORNING AS THE LOW MOVES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST...BUT WILL THEN BACK
TO WESTERLY AND INCREASE AGAIN DURING THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY
AFTERNOON. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL THUS LIKELY BE NECESSARY ON
LAKE ONTARIO DURING THIS PERIOD...THOUGH HAVE HELD OFF ON ISSUING
THESE FOR NOW GIVEN THE GALE WARNINGS CURRENTLY IN EFFECT.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
WE SHOULD BE IN GOOD SHAPE HYDROWISE DESPITE THE COPIOUS QPF. ONE
AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE WATCHED HOWEVER ARE THE ALLEGHENY AND UPPER
GENESEE BASINS AS THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE THE PCPN WILL CHANGE TO
RAIN. IF SO THERE WILL BE ISSUES WITH RUNOFF. THE 1.5 INCH QPF
WOULD CAUSE FLOODING IF TEMP WAS 33 OR 34...BUT NO PROBS IF TEMPS
ARE 30 OR 31. WILL LEAN TWD THE LATTER AT THIS TIME...SO FLOOD
ISSUES SHOULD BE MINIMAL....BUT WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DEGREE OR TWO
MAKES!

&&

.BUF WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
NY...WINTER STORM WARNING UNTIL NOON EST TODAY FOR NYZ001>008-
     010>014-019>021-085.

<hr><!--  436 AM CST WED MAR 5 2008 -->
AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION<br>
NWS GREEN BAY WI<br>
 436 AM CST WED MAR 5 2008

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY. SURFACE TROUGH MOVES EAST
ACROSS THE STATE TODAY. LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION...WEAK MOISTURE
CONVERGENCE AND THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF AN UPPER JET TO OUR SOUTH
ARE COMBINING TO PRODUCE SOME LIGHT SNOW IN MINNESOTA AND IOWA AT
09Z. T<b>AMDAR</b> SOUNDINGS FROM LATE LAST EVENING SHOWED MOISTENING IN
THE LOW LEVELS AT RHINELANDER AND WAUSAU THOUGH IT WAS STILL QUITE
DRY.

MODELS SUGGEST THAT UPPER FORCING WILL SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST BY
LATE THIS AFTERNOON WHILE COVERGENCE AND LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION
WEAKEN. THEREFORE...EXPECT ONLY LIGHT SNOW IN CENTRAL WISCONSIN
TODAY AND SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES IN THE EAST LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

ARCTIC BOUNDARY COMES THROUGH LATE TONIGHT AND 850MB TEMPERATURES
FALL TO -20C OR COLDER IN THE NORTH THURSDAY. WINDS HAVE TOO MUCH
WESTERLY COMPONENT FOR SIGNIFICANT LAKE EFFECT SNOW...THOUGH
THERE COULD BE SOME FLURRIES IN THE FAR NORTH. HIGHS WILL BE
MOSTLY IN THE TEENS.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

THE MAIN CONCERN DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST IS WHETHER THE
SHORT WAVE...EXPECTED TO REACH THE STATE SATURDAY
NIGHT/SUNDAY...WILL BRING ANY PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA. THE 00Z
ECMWF KEEPS THE FORECAST AREA DRY WHILE THE 00Z GFS BRINGS A LARGE
AREA OF SNOW TO WISCONSIN. THE 00Z NAM...THROUGH THE END OF ITS
RUN...APPEARED MORE SIMILAR TO THE 00Z ECMWF THAN THE 00Z GFS AND
THE HPC MANUAL MAX/MIN/POP GRAPHICS...ISSUED AROUND 18Z ON TUESDAY
KEPT THE AREA DRY. FOR THOSE REASONS THE 00Z ECMWF WAS FOLLOWED MORE
CLOSELY THAN THE GFS.

ECMWF QPF THURSDAY NIGHT...ASSOCIATED WITH A DEPARTING
SYSTEM...APPEARED OVERDONE COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS SO POPS WERE
REMOVED IN MOST AREAS AND CHANCE POPS WERE ONLY USED FOR PARTS OF
DOOR COUNTY. COLD AIR IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE TO PUSH SOUTH INTO
THE REGION DURING THE WEEKEND. KEPT CLOSER TO THE COLDER 00Z GFSX
MOS FOR MAX AND MIN TEMPERATURES.
&&

.AVIATION...VFR WILL GIVE WAY TO MVFR CONDITIONS AT AUW/ISW/CWA/RHI/EGV
AND SURROUNDING AIRPORTS TODAY AS AN AREA OF LIGHT SNOW APPROACHES
FROM THE WEST. ATW/GRB/MTW/SUE/PCZ/IMT SHOULD BE VFR FOR MOST OF
THE DAY...THOUGH MVFR POSSIBLE BY DUSK.

&&

.GRB WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
NONE.
