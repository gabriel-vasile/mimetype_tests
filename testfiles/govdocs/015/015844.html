<P><B><I>Patchy stunting of wheat and barley in Tanzania.</I></B></P>

<P>Catherine A. Kuwite.</P>

<P>Patchy stunting of cereals has been observed on wheat farms
of the Hanang Wheat Complex, Tanzania, since the early 1970s and
recently also on farms at West Kilimanjaro and Karatu. Estimated
yield losses amount to approximately 5-30 %, but could be as high
as 40-50 % during drier years on newly broken land. A survey was
conducted to determine the incidence of the patchy stunt pathogen
(<I>Rhizoctonia solani</I> AG-6) and other pathogenic fungi in
the main production areas and in different soil types. Potentially
pathogenic fungal species commonly isolated from the roots and
crowns of wheat and barley include<I> Bipolaris sorokiniana</I>,
<I>Fusarium equiseti, F. nygamai, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Periconia
macrospinosa</I>, and <I>Rhizoctonia</I> spp. Roots yielded mainly
<I>Fusarium </I>spp., whereas <I>B. sorokiniana</I> was predominantly
and almost exclusively isolated from crowns. The incidence of
fungi in the various soil types and production areas did not differ
significantly. Contrary to crater disease of wheat in South Africa,
patchy stunt occurs not only in black montmorillonitic clay soils,
but also in clay, clay loam, and sandy clay soils. However, the
disease is more pronounced in the predominating black clay soils.
Chemical analysis of the different soil types revealed significantly
higher levels of Ca, Mg, and Na, and a lower K content in the
black soil as compared to the other soil types. Accordingly, in
vitro growth of <I>R. solani</I> AG-6 was stimulated by increasing
levels of Ca, Mg, and Na, whereas high concentrations of K inhibited
the organism. [Work conducted together with K. van Dyk, J.J. du

Pathology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa.]</P>

<P><B><I>Quality attributes of Tanzanian bread wheat cultivars.</I></B></P>

<P>M.A. Shelembi, J.S. Noll, B.B. Chubey, and E.J. Maeda.</P>

<P>Commercial bread wheat cultivars grown in Tanzania in the past
were selected and promoted on the merit of high yield potential
and resistance to disease. Very little, if any, work was done
on the industrial quality of those varieties. At that time, quality
of wheat products was not as important to producers, consumers,
or processors as it is now. The present study was initiated to
determine in detail the quality attributes of 10 commercial cultivars
and classify them for their utilization in the baking industry.
Ten commercial bread wheat cultivars were evaluated in the field
for agronomic characteristics and in the laboratory for quality
attributes between 1991 and 1993. The cultivars were evaluated
for grain yield, test weight, kernel weight, and nine quality
parameters. The analysis of variance performed on the data revealed
differences between cultivars for grain yield, flour yield, mixograph
dough development time, farinograph water absorption, farinograph
stability, and loaf volume with and without the addition of bromate.
Significant positive relationships also were found among seven
characteristics, whereas four relationships were significant and
negative.
