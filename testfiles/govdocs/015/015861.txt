.DISCUSSION...WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO OVERNIGHT WORDING TO REMOVE              
THE MENTION OF EVENING PRECIP CHANCES...OTHERWISE...CURRENT ZFP                 
ON TARGET.                                                                      
LATEST IR LOOP CONTINUES TO SHOW A DECREASE IN CLOUD COVER ACRS                 
CNTRL IL THIS EVENING AND THIS TREND SHOULD CONTINUE. 00Z RUC                   
SUGGESTING RIDGE AXIS TO BE WELL WEST OF CNTRL IL WITH BEST                     
GRADIENT SHIFTING OFF TO OUR EAST BY 12Z. ENOUGH DECOUPLING TAKING              
PLACE BY MORNING TO ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP TO AROUND 35 DEGREES FOR                
AN HOUR OR SO. JUST ENOUGH WIND THRU MOST OF THE NIGHT ALONG WITH               
PATCHY CLOUDINESS TO KEEP TEMPS FROM GETTING TOO COLD AND KEEPING               
WDSPREAD FROST POTENTIAL LOW. CURRENT "PATCHY" FROST WORDING LOOKS              
GOOD AND WL NOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS.                                           
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...AREA TO REMAIN UNDER INFLUENCE OF                        
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION FOR MOST              
OF THE WEEK. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BRING BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES              
TO THE AREA WITH THE CHANCE FOR AT LEAST PATCHY FROST. A WARMING                
TREND SEEN TOWARD THE END OF THE WORK WEEK AND OVER THE WEEKEND.                
MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS STEM AROUND OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPS...CHANCES FOR            
PATCHY FROST AND RAIN CHANCES ON TUE AND FRI. MODELS VERY SIMILAR IN            
THE SHORT TERM SO NO REAL PREFERENCE TODAY.                                     
SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...KILX 88D SHOWING THAT               
FEW SHRA'S HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWERS ARE              
FORMING ALONG A SFC TROFF/LOW LEVEL BOUNDARY AND ARE MOVING SE IN               
THE CYCLONIC FLOW. WILL CARRY CHC POPS INTO THE EVENING HOURS. MAIN             
CONCERN TONIGHT IS DEGREE OF CLEARING AND OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPS. WENT             
WITH LOWS IN THE MID 30S NORTHERN-EASTERN ZONES BUT THIS WILL BE                
HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER. LIKEWISE...PATCHY FROST TONIGHT                
WILL ALSO DEPEND ON CLOUD COVER AND SFC WINDS. MODELS HINT AT SOME              
CLEARING...ESP AFTER MIDNIGHT AND WINDS DROPPING OFF. WILL MENTION              
PATCHY FROST IN THE NORTHERN ZONES. FROST MAY EXTEND EASTWARD INTO              
THE CMI/DAN AREA. DONT FEEL THE FROST WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENUFF FOR              
AN ADVISORY. BEST CHANCE FOR FROST APPEARS TO BE ALONG AND NORTH OF             
I-74.                                                                           
SHOULD SEE A LITTLE MORE SUN TOMORROW THAN TODAY AND TEMPS ALOFT                
SHOULD WARM A DEGREE OR TWO. BUT WITH STEEP AFTERNOON LAPSE RATES               
CLOUDS WILL AGAIN INCR AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. COULD BE A SPRINKLE OR            
TWO IN THE AFTERNOON BUT PRETTY ISOLATED AND WONT MENTION AT THIS               
TIME. CLOUDS INCR AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT SO OVERNIGHT LOWS NOT                    
EXPECTED TO BE QUITE AS LOW AS TONIGHTS (PLUS MILDER AIR ALOFT                  
WORKING INTO THE REGION AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONT). MOS NUMBERS VERY              
SIMILAR FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS BUT BOUNCING AROUND QUITE A BIT FOR HIGH             
TEMPS. MET MOS SEEMS A LITTLE HIGH FOR DAYTIME TEMPS WHILE NGM/MAV              
SEEM A LITTLE LOW. WILL USE A BLEND.                                            
LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...KEPT CHC POPS GOING FOR TUE AS             
NEXT FRONT MOVES INTO AND THROUGH THE AREA. APPEARS THAT THE FRONT              
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE NORTHERN ZONES EARLY ON SO ONLY MADE MENTION              
OF MORNING POPS IN THE NORTH...KEPT CHC POPS MOST ALL DAY ELSEWHERE.            
KEPT THE LINGERING POPS TUE NIGHT FOR THE SE.                                   
QUIET BUT COOL WEATHER THEN IN STORE FOR WED-THU. OVERNIGHT LOWS                
AGAIN DIPPING INTO THE MID 30S NORTH AND CENTRAL-EAST SO MADE                   
MENTION AGAIN OF PATCHY FROST. LATER SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE              
NEED FOR AN ADVISORY OR NOT.                                                    
LATEST MODELS BEGINNING TO SHOW A LITTLE MORE PUNCH TO THE NEXT                 
FRONT ON FRIDAY. DECIDED ALONG WITH IND TO PUT IN CHANCE POPS TO                
COVER FROPA. LEFT MENTION OF THUNDER OUT FOR NOW. MODELS SHOWING                
SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE FRONT (ECMWF FASTER-GFS A LITTLE               
SLOWER) SO WILL NOT MENTION ANY TIMING FOR NOW.                                 
TROFF ALOFT TO FINALLY EASE OUT OF THE PICTURE OVER THE WEEKEND WITH            
THE FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL AND THUS MILDER TEMPS. GFS HINTING AT              
RAIN CHANCES AGAIN BY SUNDAY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 1/2 OF THE CWA                 
BUT IT LOOKS A LITTLE OVERDONE TO ME SO I LEFT THE ZONES DRY FOR                
NOW. I RAISED TEMPS A FEW DEGREES FOR SAT-SUN DESPITE FROPA ON                  
FRIDAY AS AIRMASS WILL BE MORE OF A PACIFIC ORIGIN RATHER THAN FROM             
NORTHERN CANADA. HPC/MEX ENSEMBLE NUMBERS LOOK CLOSE AND FOLLOWED               
FAIRLY CLOSELY.

AVIATION DISCUSSION FOR 00Z...                                                  
LAKE EFFECT/DIURNAL CELLULAR RAIN SHOWERS CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN               
COVERAGE/INTENSITY THIS EVENING. HOWEVER RUC40 AND MESOETA ANALYSIS             
INDICATE SHRA ACTIVITY LIKELY TO INCREASE AS 1000-850 MB LAKE AXIS              
CONVERGENCE DRAMATICALLY INCREASES 02Z-04Z. DELTA T'S STILL QUITE               
HIGH IN UPPER TEENS AND DECENT MOISTURE TO 500 MB WITH LAKE/5H TEMP             
DIFFERENCES APPROACHING MID 40S C OVERNIGHT. MAY STILL BE A FEW                 
HOURS FOR BEST SHRA ACTIVITY TO ORGANIZE BUT WITH ANTICIPATED                   
INTENSITY HAVE INDICATED BEST IFR TEMPO CONDITIONS IN 04Z-08Z                   
TIMEFRAME AT KSBN...OTHERWISE VFR VSBY/MVFR CIGS SHOULD PREVAIL                 
UNTIL COLUMN DRIES BY LATE MORNING AT BOTH KSBN AND KFWA. 15KT                  
INCLOUD WINDS SHOULD KEEP ACTIVITY FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE LAKE HOWEVER             
SOME STRONGER BANDS COULD NEAR KFWA AND HAVE ADDED A VCSH TO

INDUCED EQUILIBRIUM TO 15KFT AND LAKE INDUCED CAPE AROUND 1000 J/KG

RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE LAKE              
EFFECT RAIN EVENTS PERSONALLY SEEN. KIWX WSR88D ALREADY INDICATING              
STORM TOTAL PCPN ABOVE AN INCH IN MICHIGAN. WHAT RAIN GAGES WE COULD            
FIND WERE OUTSIDE THE HEAVIEST BANDS BUT THEY DID INDICATE 88D

TOTALS FOR SOME AREAS COULD BE AROUND 2 INCHES. AWAY FROM                       
LAKE...SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH AND BE             
CONFINED CLOSER TO LAKE EFFECT AREAS AS EVENING PROGRESSES. CLOUDS              
WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM TAKING MUCH OF A FALL. KEPT ALL AREAS IN            
THE LOWER 40S...WARMER NEAR THE LAKE.                                           
MOISTURE PULLS OFF MONDAY MORNING BUT WITH COLD 850MB AIR AND FLOW              
BECOMING WESTERLY...SHOULD STILL SEE SOME LINGERING LIGHT SHOWERS

TRIES TO WORK IN FROM SOUTHWEST DURING THE DAY AWAY FROM LAKE AND

TEMPS FALL TO AROUND -6C BY LATE WEDNESDAY...SO AREAS AWAY FROM THE             
LAKES WITHOUT CLOUDS MAY DROP AT LEAST INTO THE MID 30S. DIURNAL                
TEMPERATURES RANGES WILL STAY BELOW NORMAL...ESPECIALLY OVER                    
NORTHERN AREAS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MAJOR UPPER LEVEL BLOCKING               
PATTERN OVER THE N ATLANTIC WITH HEIGHTS UP TO 5950 METERS WILL                 
REMAIN IN PLACE INTO NEXT WEEKEND. ANOTHER STRONG RIDGE OVER WESTERN            
N AMERICA WILL STAY INTACT THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY...BUT SOME                 
QUESTION REMAINS AS TO HOW MUCH ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERCUT THE             
RIDGE LATER IN THE WEEK OR IF THE RIDGE WILL BE ABLE TO FLATTEN AND             
WEAKEN. GFS SHOWING 5700 METER HEIGHTS EXTENDING NORTH OF 60N INTO              
FRIDAY MORNING. CANADIAN ENSEMBLES KEEP THE ATLANTIC RIDGE IN

CONSISTENCY OF STRENGTHENING THE RIDGE IN THE WEST...WILL NOT BUY               
INTO THE GFS MEX MOS WARM UP ADVERTISED FOR THIS COMING WEEKEND. GFS            
SHOWING ANOTHER REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR JUST N OF THE MN BORDER            
FRIDAY MORNING. EXPECT THE WILL BRING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY             
AND WILL KEEP TEMPS FROM RECOVERING MUCH UNTIL AFTER SUNDAY. HAVE               
KEPT SUNDAY DRY AS TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS TO WHETHER COLD               
AIR AND LAKE EFFECT SHOWERS WILL LINGER.                                        
AVIATION DISCUSSION FOR 18Z TAFS...                                             
LAKE EFFECT RAIN SHOWERS QUITE WIDESPREAD THIS AFTERNOON NEAR KSBN              
AND APPROACHING KFWA. SHOWERS ARE MAKING A LITTLE FURTHER PROGRESS              
SOUTHWARD TOWARD KFWA AS SMALL DIURNAL HEATING AND UPPER COLD POOL              
INTERACT TO AID INSTABILITY. THUS HAVE A TEMPO FOR SHOWERS AT KFWA              
THIS AFTERNOON FOLLOWED BY MVFR CIGS TONIGHT THROUGH 18Z MON AS                 
CLOUD BASES LOWER AND PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STAYS ACROSS                 
AREA. CLOSER TO KSBN...WSR88D SHOWING LAKE EFFECT SHOWERS ALL AROUND            
TAF SITE. LATEST OBSERVATION INDICATES SOME ACTIVITY OCCURING AT                
KSBN. EXPECT THROUGH REMAINDER OF AFTERNOON...MAINLY HIGH MVFR AND              
VFR CONDITIONS WITH AN OCCASIONAL SHOWER THAT BRIEFLY DROPS                     
VISIBILITIES. TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR BEST TIME THIS AFTERNOON...THEN              
AGAIN TONIGHT WITH NOCTURNAL INCREASE AND BETTER FLOW AND DELTA T               
VALUES. CONFINED VISIBILITY RESTRICTION TO MVFR CATEGORY BUT THERE              
SHOULD BE SOME HEAVY SHOWERS SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT MOVED THROUGH

228 PM MDT SUN SEP 28 2003                                                      
.DISCUSSION...FORECAST PROBLEMS WILL BE TEMPERATURES AND CHANCE OF              
PRECIPITATION...ESPECIALLY IN THE MONDAY TO TUESDAY TIME FRAME.                 
SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW AN AMPLIFIED PATTERN FROM THE CENTRAL               
PACIFIC INTO NORTH AMERICA. FLOW LOOKS TO BE ANCHORED BY STRONG                 
RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.                 
AT JET LEVEL...MODELS INITIALIZED WELL ON STRONG NORTHERN JET.                  
AT MID LEVELS...MODELS HAVING THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THE RIDGE OUT                 
WEST. IN GENERAL...THE ETA HAS THE HEIGHTS TOO HIGH BUT DOES A                  
BETTER JOB AT 500 MB THAN AT 700 MB. GFS IS DOING BETTER...ESPECIALLY           
ON THE POSITION OF THE RIDGE. THE GFS IS A LITTLE BETTER ON THE                 
SOUTHERN END OF THE RIDGE WITH ETA LOOKING A LITTLE BETTER ON THE               
NORTHERN END. GFS IS NOT BROAD ENOUGH WITH THE HIGHER HEIGHTS OVER              
THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WHERE THE ETA MAY BE A LITTLE BETTER. THE ETA              
HAS THE NOSE OF THE HIGHER HEIGHTS INTO THE PACIFIC NORTH TOO FAR               
WEST WITH THE GFS TOO LOW.                                                      
AT LOW LEVELS...MODELS ARE NOT FAR ENOUGH NORTH WITH THE MOISTURE               
RETURN. GFS DOING A LITTLE BETTER HERE AND WITH THE TEMPERATURES.               
ETA HAS THE WINDS A LITTLE BETTER. WILL GO MOSTLY WITH THE GFS WITH             
SOME TWEEKING TO IT BASED ON ITS BIASES AND WHERE THE RUC/ETA ARE               
DOING BETTER WITH IT.                                                           
FOR TONIGHT/MONDAY...LOOKS LIKE SOME LIFT MOVES INTO SOUTHERN AND               
EASTERN SECTIONS LATE TONIGHT. HIGHER 700 MB MOISTURE MOVES INTO THE            
SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 06Z            
AND 12Z. THIS MOISTURE RIBBON AND THE ABOVE MENTIONED LIFT THEN                 
PUSHES INTO THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THE MIDDLE OF           
THE DAY AND THEN MOVES TO THE EAST BY THE END OF THE DAY. WEAK                  
ISENTROPIC LIFT STARTS AFTER 21Z. DURING THIS ENTIRE PERIOD...THE               
BIGGEST LIFT IS JUST TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. THE ETA AND             
THE RUC INDICATE LIGHT PRECIPITATION GRAZING SOUTHERN SECTIONS LATE             
TONIGHT AND THE SOUTHEAST PORTION FROM 12Z TO 18Z. WILL PUT IN                  
SLIGHT CHANCE IN THOSE AREAS. THINK THE ETA POPS ARE THE MOST                   
APPROPRIATE WITH THE NGM/GFS RUSHING THINGS A LITTLE. STABILITY                 
PARAMETERS SAY SHOWERS.                                                         
BECAUSE OF THE PRECIPITATION AND LIFT...LOOKS LIKE MORE CLOUDS IN               
THE EASTERN SECTIONS TOMORROW. THINK GFS IS OVERDOING CLOUDS A                  
LITTLE. WILL GO WARMER WEST AND COOLER EAST AND PROBABLY A LITTLE               
ABOVE GUIDANCE.                                                                 
FOR MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY...RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF JET MOVES                     
OVER/CLOSE TO THE AREA BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z. JET DYNAMICS LINGER INTO            
EARLY AFTERNOON. FAIRLY STRONG SHORTWAVE ALSO MOVES THROUGH ROUGHLY             
DURING THIS SAME TIME PERIOD WITH STRONG UPWARD MOTION INDICATED.               
LIFT CONTINUES INTO THE AREA INTO THE AFTERNOON. AT THIS TIME...WILL            
GO HIGH CHANCE POPS...AND THEN OVERNIGHT SHIFT CAN TAKE IT EITHER               
WAY BUT THEY WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE RAISED. WILL CONTINUE TO GO               
WITH SHOWERS.                                                                   
LOOKS LIKE NOW THAT WILL HAVE THICK LOW LEVEL CLOUD COVER ON                    
TUESDAY. THE NEW MET MOS HAS PICKED UP ON THIS ON THE MAV GUIDANCE              
DID YESTERDAY. WILL GO WARMER THAN GUIDANCE FOR THE MINS AND HAVE A             
SMALL RANGE FOR THE DAY AND GO CLOSER TO THE COOLER GUIDANCE.                   
FOR TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY...CLEARING WILL OCCUR BEHIND SHORTWAVE              
DURING THE NIGHT WITH DOWNWARD MOTION INDICATED. WITH COOL MAXES                
WILL GO WITH THE COOLER MINS. SECONDARY JET AXIS GETS CLOSE LATE IN             
THE DAY. SHORTWAVE APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE IN THE DAY.               
HOWEVER...NO LIFT IS INDICTATED. MOISTURE ALS LOOKS DEFICIENT SO ONLY           
EXPECT CLOUDS. FOR MAXES...SINCE WILL NOT HAVE VERY MUCH CLOUDS WILL            
GO WARMER THAN THE GFS.                                                         
IN THE 4 TO 7 TIME FRAME...HOW MODELS HANDLE THE PROGRESSION/BREAK              
DOWN OF THIS RIDGE AND UPPER LOW ALONG THE WEST COAST WILL BE THE KEY           
TO THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. MODELS LOOK TO BE DOING WELL AS OF 12Z            
THIS MORNING. HOWEVER ALL THE MODELS APPEAR TO NOT BE BROAD ENOUGH              
WITH THE RIDGE/HIGHER HEIGHTS OF THE UPPER RIDGE...AND ALSO NOT                 
HIGH ENOUGH WITH THE HEIGHTS IN WESTERN CANADA. GFS IS VERY                     
CONSISTENT WITH ITS PREVIOUS RUN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE THING.               
IT IS DEVELOPING A CLOSED LOW/STRONGER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT BASIN              
WHICH IS WHAT THE ECMWF WAS HINTING AT YESTERDAY. THE ECMWF                     
CONTINUES ITS TREND FROM YESTERDAY IN DEVELOPING A STRONG SYSTEM AND            
THEN DIGGING IT INTO OUR AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST. THE UKMET HAS NOW             
TRENDED TOWARD THE ECMWF.                                                       
IF GO BY STRENGTH IN NUMBERS...IT WOULD SAY FOLLOW THE ECMWF. HOWEVER           
THE RIDGE IS CURRENTLY STRONGER THAN THE MODELS INDICATE. CONSIDERING           
CURRENT AND EXPECTED JET POSITION/STRENGTH...TREND TOWARD HAVING THE            
RIDGE FURTHER WEST FROM PREVIOUS RUN...AND ABOVE REASONING...BELIEVE            
THE ECMWF/UKMET ARE PUNCHING SYSTEM THROUGH STRONG RIDGE TOO FAST.              
THINK THE SLOWER GFS SOLUTION IS THE WAY TO GO. BASED ON THAT...WILL            
NOW HAVE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY DRY. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE ON FRIDAY           
NIGHT/SATURDAY WITH EVEN THE ECMWF AGREEING ON THAT. HOWEVER WILL               
NEED TO WATCH THIS TIME PERIOD CLOSELY FOR FURTHER SLOWING AND                  
INTENSIFICATION. WILL HAVE SUNDAY DRY. WILL NOT GO TOO FAR FROM                 
GUIDANCE BUT WILL PROBABLY CUT GUIDANCE A LITTLE ON SATURDAY DUE TO             
CLOUD COVER.

COLD FRONT THAT CROSSED THE REGION ON SATURDAY HAS REACHED THE LEE SIDE OF      
THE APPALACHIANS. A SFC TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH A SW/V MOVING THROUGH THE OH     
VALLEY THIS MORNING CROSSED MUCH OF THE CWA AFTER MIDNIGHT. DRIER AIR HAS       
BEGUN TO PUSH IN AND HELP CUT DOWN ON FOG. ANOTHER UPSTREAM SW/V WAS OVER IA.   
REGION REMAINS IN CYCLONIC NW FLOW AROUND A RELATIVELY ABNORMAL WINTER-LIKE     
TROUGH.                                                                         
WITH DEWPOINTS STILL NEAR 50 DEGREES TODAY AND DAYTIME HEATING COMBINING WITH   
SW/VS MOVING BY IN NW FLOW AND 500 MB TROUGH APPROACHING THE AREA...EXPECT AN   
EXTENSIVE CU FIELD TO DEVELOP AROUND NOON OR SO TODAY...WITH SOME SCATTERED     
SHOWERS...MAINLY OVER THE NE 2/3RDS OF THE CWA. 8H TEMPS WILL FALL THROUGHOUT   
THE DAY. SINCE THEY SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY COOLER OVER THE NW AND FAR W...WENT      
WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER HIGHS THERE IN GRIDS. GUIDANCE HIGHS WERE IN FAIRLY GOOD    
AGREEMENT AND WENT WITH A BLEND...LEANING MORE TOWARD THE MAV. SOME SPOTS WILL  
STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE 50S. HELD ONTO THE CHANCE OF SPRINKLES INTO THE      
EVENING HOURS UNTIL THE TROUGH PASSES BY. FOR LOWS TONIGHT AGAIN LEANED A BIT   
MORE TOWARD THE AVN. DEPENDING ON DEGREE OF CLEARING TONIGHT...                 
THERE COULD BE A RIDGE VALLEY SPLIT. WENT WITH A RANGE ATTM. THE COOLER SPOTS...
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE SW UNDER AXIS OF SFC RIDGING COULD SEE THE UPPER        
30S TONIGHT.                                                                    
SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD TOWARD THE REGION ON MONDAY. MODEL FORECAST        
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT SOME SHALLOW CU WILL BE POSSIBLE SO OPTED FOR PARTLY    
SUNNY VS. MOSTLY SUNNY. HIGHS WILL BE SIMILAR TO TODAY'S AS MORE SUN SHOULD     
OFFSET THE SLIGHTLY COOLER AIRMASS THAN TODAY. WITH THE SFC HIGH WORKING ACROSS 
THE AREA ON MON NIGHT...EXPECT SKIES TO BE CLEARER LONGER AND FOR MON TO BE     
COLDER THAN TONIGHT. THE COOLER SPOTS COULD REACH THE MID 30S...WITH MAYBE EVEN 
SOME PATCH FROST. ATTM...WILL MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE HWO.              
ON TUE...ANOTHER SW/V AND ACCOMPANYING SFC LOW AND COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE GREAT LAKES AND THE OH VALLEY. WARM ADVECTION AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM SHOULD   
ALLOW ALL AREAS TO GET INTO THE 60S...TEMPORARILY. THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP   
ALTHOUGH SMALL LOOKS TO BE TUE NIGHT INTO WED AM.                               
EXTENDED...THE EXTENDED PERIOD STILL LOOKS COLD AND SEEMS TO BE TRENDING COLDER.
A SW/V SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THIS TROUGH ON TUE NIGHT INTO WED AND BRING A CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR. MEAN TROUGH REMAINS OVER THE    
EASTERN US THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD...WITH A RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. WITH 8H TEMPS 
AROUND -3C PROGGED BY GFS BY 0Z FRI. THIS MAY BE A BIT OVERDONE...BUT           
NEVERTHELESS...WITH COLD ADVECTION ALL DAY TEMPS WILL NOT RISE FAR ON THURSDAY. 
FRIDAY MORNING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE COLDEST SO FAR THIS SEASON WITH      
THE POSSIBILITY OF A WIDESPREAD FROST. THIS POTENTIAL WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN    
THE HWO. A MOISTURE STARVED SYSTEM SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES FRI      
NIGHT/SAT...BUT WITH EAST TO WEST ORIENTED SFC HIGH OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES... 
GULF MOISTURE SHOULD BE LIMITED. CUT BACK POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LATE        
FRI INTO SAT WITH THIS SYSTEM. MEX 24 HR POPS ARE ONLY AROUND 20. TEMPS SHOULD  
MODERATE AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT PROBABLY REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THE ENTIRE     
WEEK.

EVENING UPDATE WILL CONSIST OF BUMPING TEMPS UP JUST A COUPLE OF                
DEGREES.  VARIABLE CLOUDINESS AND DEWPOINTS LINGERING IN THE UPPER              
50S...WON'T LEAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DROP TEMPS TO THE LOWER END OF MID             
40S TONIGHT.  EXPERIENCING PATCHY FOG AT THE AIRPORT HERE...VIS                 
VARYING FROM 1/2SM TO P6SM AS FOG COMES AND GOES.  FOG WILL BE                  
ENHANCED ALONG CREEKS AND RIVERS.  BUMPED POPS UP FOR THE REMAINDER             
OF THE NIGHT INTO THE SLIGHT CHANCE CAT FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS

COLD FRONT THAT CROSSED THE REGION ON SATURDAY HAS REACHED THE LEE SIDE OF      
THE APPALACHIANS. A SFC TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH A SW/V MOVING THROUGH THE OH     
VALLEY THIS MORNING CROSSED MUCH OF THE CWA AFTER MIDNIGHT. DRIER AIR HAS       
BEGUN TO PUSH IN AND HELP CUT DOWN ON FOG. ANOTHER UPSTREAM SW/V WAS OVER IA.   
REGION REMAINS IN CYCLONIC NW FLOW AROUND A RELATIVELY ABNORMAL WINTER-LIKE     
TROUGH.                                                                         
WITH DEWPOINTS STILL NEAR 50 DEGREES TODAY AND DAYTIME HEATING COMBINING WITH   
SW/VS MOVING BY IN NW FLOW AND 500 MB TROUGH APPROACHING THE AREA...EXPECT AN   
EXTENSIVE CU FIELD TO DEVELOP AROUND NOON OR SO TODAY...WITH SOME SCATTERED     
SHOWERS...MAINLY OVER THE NE 2/3RDS OF THE CWA. 8H TEMPS WILL FALL THROUGHOUT   
THE DAY. SINCE THEY SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY COOLER OVER THE NW AND FAR W...WENT      
WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER HIGHS THERE IN GRIDS. GUIDANCE HIGHS WERE IN FAIRLY GOOD    
AGREEMENT AND WENT WITH A BLEND...LEANING MORE TOWARD THE MAV. SOME SPOTS WILL  
STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE 50S. HELD ONTO THE CHANCE OF SPRINKLES INTO THE      
EVENING HOURS UNTIL THE TROUGH PASSES BY. FOR LOWS TONIGHT AGAIN LEANED A BIT   
MORE TOWARD THE AVN. DEPENDING ON DEGREE OF CLEARING TONIGHT...                 
THERE COULD BE A RIDGE VALLEY SPLIT. WENT WITH A RANGE ATTM. THE COOLER SPOTS...
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE SW UNDER AXIS OF SFC RIDGING COULD SEE THE UPPER        
30S TONIGHT.                                                                    
SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD TOWARD THE REGION ON MONDAY. MODEL FORECAST        
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT SOME SHALLOW CU WILL BE POSSIBLE SO OPTED FOR PARTLY    
SUNNY VS. MOSTLY SUNNY. HIGHS WILL BE SIMILAR TO TODAY'S AS MORE SUN SHOULD     
OFFSET THE SLIGHTLY COOLER AIRMASS THAN TODAY. WITH THE SFC HIGH WORKING ACROSS 
THE AREA ON MON NIGHT...EXPECT SKIES TO BE CLEARER LONGER AND FOR MON TO BE     
COLDER THAN TONIGHT. THE COOLER SPOTS COULD REACH THE MID 30S...WITH MAYBE EVEN 
SOME PATCH FROST. ATTM...WILL MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE HWO.              
ON TUE...ANOTHER SW/V AND ACCOMPANYING SFC LOW AND COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE GREAT LAKES AND THE OH VALLEY. WARM ADVECTION AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM SHOULD   
ALLOW ALL AREAS TO GET INTO THE 60S...TEMPORARILY. THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP   
ALTHOUGH SMALL LOOKS TO BE TUE NIGHT INTO WED AM.                               
EXTENDED...THE EXTENDED PERIOD STILL LOOKS COLD AND SEEMS TO BE TRENDING COLDER.
A SW/V SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THIS TROUGH ON TUE NIGHT INTO WED AND BRING A CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR. MEAN TROUGH REMAINS OVER THE    
EASTERN US THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD...WITH A RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. WITH 8H TEMPS 
AROUND -3C PROGGED BY GFS BY 0Z FRI. THIS MAY BE A BIT OVERDONE...BUT           
NEVERTHELESS...WITH COLD ADVECTION ALL DAY TEMPS WILL NOT RISE FAR ON THURSDAY. 
FRIDAY MORNING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE COLDEST SO FAR THIS SEASON WITH      
THE POSSIBILITY OF A WIDESPREAD FROST. THIS POTENTIAL WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN    
THE HWO. A MOISTURE STARVED SYSTEM SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES FRI      
NIGHT/SAT...BUT WITH EAST TO WEST ORIENTED SFC HIGH OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES... 
GULF MOISTURE SHOULD BE LIMITED. CUT BACK POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LATE        
FRI INTO SAT WITH THIS SYSTEM. MEX 24 HR POPS ARE ONLY AROUND 20. TEMPS SHOULD  
MODERATE AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT PROBABLY REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THE ENTIRE     
WEEK.

CWA BY DAYBREAK...BUT HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF MIXING WITH SNOW LATER              
IN THE DAY. CORRESPONDING COLD AIR ADVECTION DURING THE DAY SHOULD              
LIMIT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 30S TO AROUND 40 INLAND...BUT SHOULD SEE               
LOWER 40S NEAR THE LAKE SHORES...ESPECIALLY NEAR LAKE MICHIGAN. THE             
SOUTHERN CWA MAY SEE MORE RAIN THAN SNOW...MAINLY NEAR THE SHORE                
WHERE INFLUENCE FROM WATER IS GREATEST. ANY PRECIP IS BOUND TO BE

WITH THE SURFACE LOW REMAINING POSITIONED JUST NORTH AND EAST OF                
LAKE SUPERIOR...A STRONG NORTHERLY FLOW WILL PUSH -8C TO -10C 850MB             
TEMPS ACROSS CWA. THIS COLD AIR WILL KEEP HIGHS SLIGHTLY COLDER THAN            
TUESDAY...AND ANY CLEARING MAY ALLOW FOR LOWER TEMPS WEDNESDAY                  
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE SLIDING DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS FROM                  
SOUTHERN MANITOBA MAY BRING WEAK SURFACE RIDGING BY THURSDAY                    
AFTERNOON. THIS MAY ALLOW PRECIP TO COME TO AN END ACROSS THE                   
WESTERN PORTIONS AT THIS TIME...HOWEVER GIVEN CONTINUING NORTH TO               
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL CONTINUE CHANCES FOR

THE EXTENDED FORECAST FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY IS BECOMING MORE               
TRICKY AS INFLUENCE FROM 500MB LOW OVER HUDSON BAY STILL PERSISTS.              
MODELS IN AGREEMENT OF A SLIGHT BACKING OF WINDS AND WARM AIR                   
ADVECTION DURING FRIDAY...AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING SHORTWAVE OVER                  
NORTHERN CANADA THAT SLIDES DOWN THE BACKSIDE OF THE RIDGE OVER THE             
WESTERN CONUS. HOWEVER...THE MODELS DO DIFFER IN THE TIMING OF THIS             
SYSTEM...WITH ECMWF AND UKMET ABOUT 24 HOURS QUICKER THAN MRF                   
SOLUTION. AT THIS POINT...WILL INTRODUCE INCREASING CLOUDS ON

PRESSURE RISES HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS OVER NW               
MT FROM CUTBANK TO HELENA WEST TO THE DIVIDE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN              
NEARLY DOUBLING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT FROM SPOKANE TO KALISPELL                 
SINCE THIS AFTERNOON. THE RUC SUGGESTS THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD              
THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE COOL AIR CONTINUE TO FILTER DOWN FROM                  
CANADA. ONCE ENOUGH COOL AIR PILES IN...IT WILL BEGIN TO SURGE OVER             
THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE AND THROUGH THE PURCELL TRENCH...BRINGING                
STRONG NE WINDS FROM SANDPOINT TO COEUR D'ALENE. THE LATEST RUC AND             
MESOETA SUGGEST THIS SURGE WILL BEGIN SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE               
COOL AND DRY AIR WILL CONTINUE TO INVADE THE REGION ON MONDAY AS                
THE CENTER OF THE SURFACE-850MB ANTICYCLONE MOVES FROM ITS CURRENT              
POSITION OVER CENTRAL ALBERTA INTO NORTHERN MT. MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR             
TOMORROW INDICATE THE CORE OF THE STRONGEST COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL             
HIT THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE IDAHO PANHANDLE AND NE WASHINGTON. 24              
HOUR CHANGES INDICATE AT LEAST 5C OF COOLING FROM 850 MB ON DOWN IN             
THIS AREA...WITH LESSER AMOUNTS ACROSS OTHER PORTIONS OF THE CWA.               
THIS COOLING SUGGEST THE PREVIOUS MAX TEMP FORECASTS MAY BE A BIT               
TOO WARM FOR TOMORROW FROM SPOKANE TO SANDPOINT. GRIDS AND TEMPS                
WILL BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY. ASIDE FROM THE COOLING...WE LOOK FOR A             
DECENT EPISODE OF NE WINDS...ESPEICALLY OVER THE EASTERN RIDGES AND             
THROUGH THE PURCELL TRENCH. WE COULD SEE WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 30             
MPH IN THESE AREAS AS 850 MB WIND PROGS SHOW A DECENT AREA OF 25+               
KT WINDS. FORECAST WILL BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY. THE WIND COMBINED               
WITH LOW MIN RH VALUES FOR MONDAY ALSO RAISES A FIRE CONCERN...                 
HOWEVER...WE THINK THE COOLING COULD PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO THE RH              
VALUES TO KEEP THEM ABOVE CRITICAL LEVELS. FX

140 PM MON SEP 29 2003                                                          
.DISCUSSION...                                                                  
FCST AREA WILL REMAIN IN THE GRIPS OF THIS PNA PTRN, WITH COLD ERN              
U.S TROF TO AMPLIFY BY MIDWEEK. S/WV'S ROTATING ARND THIS TROF,                 
ENHANCED BY LAKE INFLUENCES, WILL BE THE MAIN MECHANISM FOR ROUNDS              
OF -SHRA ACTIVITY.                                                              
.SHORT TERM...                                                                  
SCT -SHRA CRNTLY DOT THE FCST AREA. NXT S/WV, EVIDENT IN WATER VAPOR            
IMAGERY AND RUC 500 MB ANYLS MOVG INTO SRN WI/NRN IL, IS FCST TO PASS           
THE RGN TNGT. THE MDLS ALSO SHOW SFC RIDGING LATER TNGT ACRS CNTRL              
NY AND NE PA. MOST ACTIVITY IN THIS TYPE OF PTRN IS DIURNALLY                   
FORCED, BUT THE LOW LVL FLOW FAVORS INPUT OF MSTR ACRS THE SRN TIER             
FROM LAKE ERIE, AND INTO FAR NRN ZONES FROM LAKE ONTARIO UNTIL THE              
FLOW BEGINS TO BACK LATER THIS EVNG. ATTM THINK THE MAIN THREAT FOR             
-SHRA WILL BE BEFORE MDNGT, SO WILL CALL FOR SOME EVENING SHOWERS,              
THEN GO WITH PC/MC SKIES FOR THE OVERNGT PD. AS FOR MINS, WE MAY SEE            
A FEW SPOTS GET INTO THE M30S, AND I WOULD NOT BE SUPRISED TO SEE               
ISOLD SPOTS OF LGT FROST ACRS THE TWIN TIERS IF WE GET A DECENT                 
BREAK IN THE CLDS. CRNT TD'S ARE IN THE M/U40S AND AM NOT CONFIDENT             
ENOUGH TO ISSUE AN ADVISORY, SO WE'LL LET EVNG SHIFT MONITOR CLD                
TRENDS/TEMPS AND MAKE THE DECISION IF A LOCALIZED FROST ADVISORY IS             
REQUIRED.                                                                       
LOW LVL FLOW BCMS MORE SWLY TMRW. TMRW'S PROFILES ARE QUITE SIMILAR             
TO TDA'S, ALTHO LOW LVLS ARE A LTL DRIER. THEY STILL INDICATE SOME              
MID LVL INSTABILTY WHICH COULD LEAD TO A FEW LOW TOP -SHRA IN THE               
AFTN. WILL INTRODUCE A LOW CHC POP FOR TMRW AFTN ACRS UPSTATE NY.               
THIS ACTIVITY MAY BE AIDED BY ANOTHER S/WV WHICH NOSES INTO UPSTATE             
AFTER 18Z. THIS SHOWER ACTIVITY MAY PERSIST INTO TUES EVNG. ALL IN              
ALL THINK TMRW NGT WILL BE GNRLY DRY, AS THE SRN STREAM S/WV WHICH              
TRACKS ACRS PA LOOKS LIKE IT WILL ONLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MID               
AND HIGH LVL CLD, AND LOW LVL FLOW SHUD KEEP ANY LAKE PCPN N AND W              
OF THE BGM CWA. ON WED, A SIG S/WV WILL BE ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE             
TROF AND MOVG INTO THE LOWER GTLAKES. BEST CHC FOR SHOWERS APPEARS              
TO BE IN THE AFTN ACRS THE CNTRL SRN TIER AND FINGER LAKES WITH                 
PS/MC SKIES ACRS NE PA.                                                         
.LONG TERM...

XTNDD PD MARKED BY A LONG WV TROF. MODELS HAVE AGAIN ADJUSTED THE               
TIMING OF THE SHRT WV/S IN THE FAST FLOW...BUT WITH THE CYCLONIC                
NWLY FLOW AND CAA...LAKES WILL BE ACTIVE BLURRING END AND BEGIN                 
TIMES OF PCPN. H8 AIR DROPS TO -6C AND LAKES ARE STILL QUITE WRM                
...SO THERE/S PLENTY OF INSTABILITY AVBL. AIR IS COLD ENUF TO                   
CONSIDER PCPN TYPE FOR THE FIRST TIME. LOOKS LIKE SOME FORM OF FRZN             
PCPN PSBL...ESP OVER NRN ONEIDA AT NGT...BUT COLD AIR DOESN/T SEEM              
DEEP ENUF TO GET ANY REAL SNOW GOING...ESP WHEN THE LOW LVLS WILL BE            
STRONGLY MODIFIED BY THE LAKE.                                                  
LOOKS LIKE A BRIEF BRK IN THE ACTION LATE THU EARLY FRI AS A STRONG             
SHRT WV VEERS WIND AND BRINGS SLGTLY WRMR AIR. NEXT BRK OCURRS SUN              
AHD OF A STRONG SRN SHRT WV.                                                    
.AVIATION...NEXT 24 HRS DOMINATED BY W TO NW FLOW PTRN WITH CAA.                
THIS TIME OF YEAR...THAT MEANS VFR TO MVFR CONDS UNDER A SOLID SC               
DECK. SCT SHWRS PSBL...BUT SHEAR AND MRGN LAKE CAPES WILL LIMIT LAKE
