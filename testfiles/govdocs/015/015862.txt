OVER THE SAN LUIS VALLEY. WENT ABOUT 3-5 DEGREES BELOW MOS AT PUB

TONIGHT...ANOTHER STRONG RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHT FOR THE LOW LYING            
AREAS LIKE THE AR RIVER VALLEY AND SAN LUIS VALLEY CENTER FLOOR.                
WENT A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW MOS AT ALS...PUB...LHX...AND LAA. THE               
NEW NAM MOS HAS BEEN PERFORMING A LITTLE BETTER DURING THESE STRONG             
RADIATIONAL COOLING EVENTS. THERE MIGHT BE SOME CI CLOUDS...SO                  
HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN`T TEMPER THE COOLING TOO MUCH. METZE

...SIGNIFICANT WINTER WEATHER POSSIBLE THURSDAY OR FRIDAY...                    
MAIN WEATHER OF INTEREST IN THE EXTENDED WILL BE ON AND AROUND THE              
THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY. BEFORE THEN...PATTERN REMAINS RATHER TRANQUIL.            
A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH NE CO ON SUNDAY. THIS FEATURE IS                  
LOOKING A LITTLE STRONGER THAN IN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS...SO MIGHT                
ACTUALLY SEE A FEW SNOWFLAKES OVR THE NRN MTS....AROUND KLXV. HAVE              
INTRODUCED LOW POPS FOR THE MTS...BUT LIKELY WILL ONLY AMT TO                   
FLURRIES IF ANYTHING. HAVE ALSO COOLED THINGS DOWN JUST A BIT FOR               
SUN AND SUN NIGHT WITH TEMPS ALOFT LOOKING A BIT LOWER. THE UPPER               
RIDGE WILL REBUILD MON AND TUE...AND TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE 10 DEG OR              
SO HIGHER THAN AVG FOR THE PLAINS. CLEAR SKIES WILL PREVAIL.                    
BIG CHANGES IN THE WX BEGIN ON WED...AS A DISTURBANCE IN THE SRN                
BRANCH OF THE JET TAKES SHAPE OVR SRN CA OR BAJA REGION. THIS FEATURE           
WILL PHASE WITH A STRONG NRN BRANCH ON WED...AND THEN FOLLOW THE                
JET THRU THE SRN ROCKIES ON THU AND FRI. THERE IS STILL QUITE A SPREAD          
BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE STRENGTH AND THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM.               
THE TREND IS FOR A SLOWER SYSTEM...WHICH WOULD PLACE THE GREATEST               
IMPACTS FOR SE CO FOR LATE THU INTO FRI. IF THE LATEST MODEL RUNS               
VERIFY...EVEN THE CENTRAL MTS MAY NOT SEE ANY PRECIP UNTIL THU MORNING.         
DGEX IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT                     
SNOWFALL FOR THE MTS AND PLAINS BY FRI. GFS REMAINS A BIT MORE                  
CONSERVATIVE. EC AND CANADIAN ARE A COMPROMISE. WITH THE STRONG                 
SRN BRANCH OF THE JET...THE MORE SRN TRACK SEEN IN THE DGEX                     
SOLUTION HAS SOME APPEAL...ALTHOUGH QPF MAY BE A BIT EXCESSIVE IN               
THAT MODEL. BOTTOM LINE...THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR HIGH IMPACT                    
WINTER WX FOR MUCH OF THE AREA THU THRU FRI. HOLIDAY TRAVELERS                  
SHOULD PLAN FOR ADVERSE CONDITIONS AND BE PREPARED TO CHANGE OR                 
MODIFY PLANS ACCORDINGLY. IN GRIDS...CURRENTLY HAVE PRECIP                      
STARTING AS RAIN OVR THE PLAINS ON THU...BUT WOULD NOT BE                       
SURPRISED TO SEE AN ALL SNOW EVENT. WILL TAKE A COUPLE MORE DAYS

REGION FROM THE W...IN RESPONSE TO WEAKENING SHORTWAVE PASSING                  
THROUGH...AS WELL AS INTENSIFYING MID LEVEL WARM                                
ADVECTION/ISENTROPIC LIFT. THE RUC13 DEPICTS THIS MOISTURE RATHER               
WELL...ESP AROUND 700 MB...AND ALSO INDICATES THAT THE ASSOCIATED               
CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE N/E WELL AFTER MIDNIGHT.                   
THUS...WE HAVE INCREASED THE CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING              
HOURS...AND ALSO HAVE SLOWED THE TEMP FALL OVERNIGHT...AS TEMPS                 
SHOULD HOLD NEARLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS AS THE THICKEST MID              
LEVEL CLOUDS PASS THROUGH. THE TEMPS SHOULD ACCELERATE DOWNWARD ONCE            
AGAIN JUST PRIOR TO DAYBREAK...AS SOME BREAKS DEVELOP...ESP FROM                
ALBANY SOUTH AND WEST. THEREFORE...WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE EXPECTED             
MIN TEMPS MUCH...JUST THE TEMP CURVE FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD.

EXTREME NORTHERN HERKIMER/NW HAMILTON COS OVER THE NEXT FEW                     
HOURS...AS LATEST KTYX RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW SOME WEAK

THREAT OF ANY SNOW SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

ADVECTION...SO EVEN WITH INCREASING HIGH AND MID CLOUDS THROUGH                 
THE DAY...TEMPERATURES SHOULD REACH WELL INTO THE 30S TO MID 40S                
FOR HIGHS. MONDAY NIGHT...ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES AND                         
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING INCREASES SUPPORTING PRECIPITATION SPREADING              
ACROSS THE REGION. GENERAL CONSENSUS FROM MOST SOURCES OF                       
GUIDANCE/ENSEMBLES SUGGEST AREAS WEST OF THE HUDSON VALLEY COULD                
SEE MOSTLY SNOW MONDAY NIGHT...WHILE AREAS ALONG AND EAST OF THE                
HUDSON VALLEY COULD SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF SNOW/MIX BEFORE CHANGING              
TO A COLD RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH THE RAPID WARMING ALOFT...SOME              
AREAS COULD SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF FREEZING RAIN AROUND                          
SUNRISE...BEFORE SURFACE TEMPERATURES CAN RESPOND TO THE WARM                   
ADVECTION LATER IN THE MORNING. HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE GREENS                 
AND BERKSHIRES COULD SEE A DECENT PERIOD OF SNOW MONDAY NIGHT AS                
WELL. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE IN THE 20S TO MID 30S...AND MAY                 
OCCUR DURING THE EVENING WHEN PRECIPITATION BEGINS AND                          
TEMPERATURES FALL A BIT TOWARD WET BULBS...THEN COULD RISE A                    
COUPLE/FEW DEGREES TOWARD SUNRISE.

TEXT FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY NORNING WILL INDICATE                
QUITE THE MIX AND TRANSITION OF PRECIPITATION TYPES IN SOME                     
AREAS...BUT VARIOUS PRECIPITATION TYPES SHOULD BE OBSERVED AT                   
DIFFERENT ELEVATION LEVELS...AND BE CHANGABLE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND             
MORNING.  COLD GROUND COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OBSERVATIONS OF FREEZING              
RAIN AS WELL.  SUGGESTING 2-4" OF SNOW IN SOME OF THE ADIRONDACKS               
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AND 3-6" IN OTHER PARTS OF THE                           
ADIRONDACKS...JUST AS A STARTING POINT...AS AMOUNTS WILL CERTAINLY              
NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AS THE EVENT GETS CLOSER.

ON TUESDAY...SCREAMING H8 JET BLASTS QUICKLY THROUGH NEW ENGLAND                
AND HEADS INTO CANADA BY LATER TUESDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MUCH OF THE              
STRONG WINDS SHOULD NOT MIX TO THE SURFACE. HOWEVER...IN THE HIGHER             
ELEVATIONS OF THE GREEN MOUNTAINS AND BERKSHIRES SHOULD SEE SOME                
HIGH WIND GUSTS...AND MAY ENTERTAIN WIND ADVISORIES AS THE EVENT                
GETS CLOSER. SNOW SHOULD CONTINUE IN THE NORTHERN CATSKILLS AND                 
ADIRONDACKS...WITH SOME POTENTIAL MIXING WITH RAIN...AND HIGHS IN               
THE MID 30S. OTHERWISE...MOST AREAS WILL SEE A COLD RAIN TUESDAY                
WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S.                                         
THE UPPER LOW SLOWS AND DRIFTS NORTH AND WEST OF OUR REGION LATER               
TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WIND ANOMALIES (-4 SD TO -6 SD U WIND                
ANOMALIES AT 850 MB AND -2.5 SD TO -3.5 SD AT 250 MB) STILL                     
SUGGEST A SLOW MOVING SYSTEM WITH STRONG FORCING FOR A PROLONGED                
PERIOD OF HEAVY PRECIPITATION...BUT GUIDANCE SOURCES SEEM TO LIFT               
THE UPPER LOW INTO CANADA FAIRLY QUICKLY. STRONGEST FORCING NOW                 
LOOKS TO BE IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND POINTS NORTH AND EAST.                  
BOUNDARY LAYER THERMAL GRADIENT NOT AS STRONG AS SOME SIMILAR                   
HISTORICAL STORMS...AND LOW/MID LEVEL MOISTURE FROM ATLANTIC AS                 
GULF OF MEXICO LARGELY CUT OFF FROM THIS SYSTEM...ALTHOUGH UPPER                
JET AND MOISTURE PLUME SEEN ALOFT. SO THIS STORM MAY HAVE MUCH                  
MORE OF AN IMPACT OUTSIDE OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT STILL                         
RESPECTABLE SNOWS SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITHIN

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT AS UPPER LOW GRADUALLY DRIFTS INTO                      
CANADA...DEEP WEST FLOW TAKES OVER...AND PRECIPITATION WILL BE                  
LIMITED TO SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY...AND LAKE ENHANCED PRECIPITATION.

GOOD CLIP BY FRIDAY.  THE SYNOPTIC EVENT WILL BE OVER WITH AT THE               
START OF THANKSGIVING DAY...BUT LAKE EFFECT WILL COMMENCE ON ITS                
HEELS...AS THE VERTICAL PROFILE OF THE ENSUING WESTERLY FLOW ON THE             
BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM REMAINS LOW ON SHEAR COMPARED WITH

WELL-CONFINED BAND AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN ADIRONDACKS...            
AND THIS WILL PROBABLY PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY AND MUCH OF THE                  
OVERNIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WHEN THE WESTERLY FLOW BREAKS DOWN...AS DOES

THAT`S HAD AT MOST LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE BELT.  THE WEAKENING COLD

CAPE COD SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH SIMILAR CIRCULATION PATTERNS BETWEEN             
THE SURFACE AND 500 MB...SO HAVE CHC -RA/-SN SAT NGT...THEN BACK TO             
A LAKE EFFECT FLOW FOR SUNDAY.                                                  
TEMPERATURES SHOW LITTLE DAY-TO-DAY VARIATION IN PATTERN UNTIL                  
SUNDAY...WHEN THE DEPARTING LOW DRAWS IN MORE COLDER AIR ACROSS THE             
CWA.  MERCURIES SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING TO 40 DEGREES EACH               
DAY IN THE HUDSON VALLEY.  LOWS IN THE 20S WITH SOME ADIRONDACK                 
UPPER TEENS EACH NIGHT BECOME LOWS MOSTLY AROUND 20 SUNDAY NIGHT...             
WITH SOME LOW TO MID TEENS IN THE ADIRONDACKS.  THE MEX MOS VALUES              
ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE FCST VALUES...WITH THE MODEL EFFECTIVELY

TUESDAY. SOME PARTS OF THE CATSKILLS...TACONICS AND BERKSHIRES                  
COULD SEE LOCALLY HEAVIER RAINFALL...AN INCH OR MORE.                           
AT THIS POINT...IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE FLOODING WILL BE A PROBLEM                
ASIDE FROM PAVED AREAS WHERE DRAINAGE MAY BE BLOCKED BY PILES OF                
SNOW OR DEBRIS. HOWEVER A POTENTIAL EXISTS THAT THE STORM COULD                 
BRING MORE RAIN THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE BAY AND ATLANTIC ZONES. ADDED THE BAY

DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE WILL PULL AWAY FROM THE MID ATLANTIC                 
COAST TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...RESULTING IN OUR PREVAILING WINDS                
TURNING MORE EASTERLY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY...THOUGH                 
BELIEVE THE GFS/NAM ARE A BIT TOO BULLISH ON THIS. KEPT SLIGHT                  
CHANCE POPS NEXT FEW DAYS FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST...BUT OTHERWISE                
MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.                                     
MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE FCST IS AGAIN ON THE LAND BREEZE AND               
ITS EFFECTS ON TEMPS AGAIN TONIGHT...AND MONDAY NIGHT AS WELL.                  
GFS/NAM AND EVEN THE WRF DO NOT SHOW THE LAND BREEZE DEVELOPING                 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE PATTERN IS NOT CHANGING MUCH AND SO WE                   
BELIEVE IT WILL OCCUR. THE NAM/WRF LOOK WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH                 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...AND THEY START THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND                    
BREEZE EARLY ON BEFORE THE WINDS SURGE TAKES OVER SWITCHING WINDS               
BACK NE. SINCE THIS SURGE LOOKS TO AGGRESSIVE...DECIDED TO                      
DISCOUNT THIS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING IS                  
AGAIN EXPECTED IN A STILL RATHER DRY AIRMASS...DECIDED TO BRING                 
THE LAND BREEZE ACROSS MUCH OF THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS AGAIN                 
TONIGHT...BUT NOT QUITE TO THE COAST...REASON BEING THAT IT MADE                
IT TO THE COAST JUST FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING...AND ANY SLIGHT                  
INCREASE IN THE NE-E WIND OVERNIGHT WOULD HOLD IT AT BAY. SHOULD                
MENTION THAT THE RUC IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR                 
EXPECTATIONS TONIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACT THE FCST ON THE LAND BREEZE               
HAS IS WITH REGARDS TO TEMPS...AS IT CAN FLUCTUATE 5-10F DEGREES                
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY...AS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW                      
MORNING`S.                                                                      
KEPT PATCHY FOG IN THE FCST TONIGHT AND MON NIGHT. MON NIGHT LOOKS              
TO BE MOST OPTIMAL...AHEAD OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH.                             
GFS/ECMWF STILL SHOW THE COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY              
NIGHT INTO WED MORNING...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVING BY ON                 
TUESDAY. AFTER TEMPS WARM FINALLY TO NEAR 80 AHEAD OF THE FRONT                 
TUESDAY...A SLIGHT COOL DOWN WILL OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE                 
FRONT. MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED...SO MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS                  
ANTICIPATED.                                                                    
MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FCST. THE DRY NOVEMBER WEATHER                  
PATTERN LOOKS TO CONTINUE. BOTH GFS/ECMWF SHOW A GRADUAL WARMING                
TREND LATE IN THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND...WITH YET ANOTHER                 
COLD FRONT EXPECTED EITHER SUNDAY OR MONDAY...DEPENDING ON THE                  
MODEL...AND JUST TOO EARLY TO TELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME...BUT THE              
PARADE OF FRONTS LOOK TO CONTINUE.                                              
MARINE...DECIDED TO EXTEND THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR THE                     
ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING...AS GULF STREAM SEAS WILL                 
LIKELY NOT START SUBSIDING UNTIL LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT DUE TO              
THE FACT THAT WINDS WILL REMAIN FROM A MORE NE DIRECTION BEFORE                 
BECOMING EASTERLY LATER TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...WINDS OVER THE NEXT                
FEW DAYS WILL SLACKEN LEADING TO IMPROVING MARINE CONDITIONS. THE               
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY...SWITCHING                
WINDS TO W-NW...AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE                  
AREA TUE NIGHT INTO EARLY WED MORNING...WITH A BRIEF WIND SURGE                 
EXPECTED BEHIND IT...BUT GUIDANCE SUGGESTS ONLY 15-20 KT AND NOT                
TOO PROLONGED.                                                                  
FIRE WEATHER...RH`S HAVE BEEN DOWN AGAIN TO NEAR 40 PERCENT AS                  
SOME DRY AIR HAS MIXED DOWN. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE JUST A TAD                  
ON MONDAY. SLIGHT DRYING IS EXPECTED TUESDAY BEHIND A PRE-FRONTAL               
TROUGH...BUT NOT EXPECTED TO BE DRY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO RESULT               
IN CRITICAL RH`S. HOWEVER...WILL MONITOR TRENDS...BECAUSE TUE WILL              
BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK...AND IF MORE DRYING OCCURS BETWEEN              
THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT...THEN RH`S COULD              
FALL LOWER THAN FCST. THE DRIEST AIR WILL ADVECT IN ACROSS THE                  
AREA BEHIND THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. TRENDED DEW POINTS/RH`S                     
DOWN...THOUGH NOT AS LOW AS THE NAM AT THIS TIME...WHICH DROPS DEW              
POINTS TO THE LOWER 30S NW INTERIOR TO THE LOWER 40S SE. WE LIKELY

FORECAST.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 234 PM EST SUN NOV 23 2008/                         
DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE WILL PULL AWAY FROM THE MID ATLANTIC                 
COAST TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...RESULTING IN OUR PREVAILING WINDS                
TURNING MORE EASTERLY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY...THOUGH                 
BELIEVE THE GFS/NAM ARE A BIT TOO BULLISH ON THIS. KEPT SLIGHT                  
CHANCE POPS NEXT FEW DAYS FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST...BUT OTHERWISE                
MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.                                     
MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE FCST IS AGAIN ON THE LAND BREEZE AND               
ITS EFFECTS ON TEMPS AGAIN TONIGHT...AND MONDAY NIGHT AS WELL.                  
GFS/NAM AND EVEN THE WRF DO NOT SHOW THE LAND BREEZE DEVELOPING                 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE PATTERN IS NOT CHANGING MUCH AND SO WE                   
BELIEVE IT WILL OCCUR. THE NAM/WRF LOOK WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH                 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...AND THEY START THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND                    
BREEZE EARLY ON BEFORE THE WINDS SURGE TAKES OVER SWITCHING WINDS               
BACK NE. SINCE THIS SURGE LOOKS TO AGGRESSIVE...DECIDED TO                      
DISCOUNT THIS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING IS                  
AGAIN EXPECTED IN A STILL RATHER DRY AIRMASS...DECIDED TO BRING                 
THE LAND BREEZE ACROSS MUCH OF THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS AGAIN                 
TONIGHT...BUT NOT QUITE TO THE COAST...REASON BEING THAT IT MADE                
IT TO THE COAST JUST FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING...AND ANY SLIGHT                  
INCREASE IN THE NE-E WIND OVERNIGHT WOULD HOLD IT AT BAY. SHOULD                
MENTION THAT THE RUC IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR                 
EXPECTATIONS TONIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACT THE FCST ON THE LAND BREEZE               
HAS IS WITH REGARDS TO TEMPS...AS IT CAN FLUCTUATE 5-10F DEGREES                
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY...AS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW                      
MORNING`S.                                                                      
KEPT PATCHY FOG IN THE FCST TONIGHT AND MON NIGHT. MON NIGHT LOOKS              
TO BE MOST OPTIMAL...AHEAD OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH.                             
GFS/ECMWF STILL SHOW THE COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY              
NIGHT INTO WED MORNING...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVING BY ON                 
TUESDAY. AFTER TEMPS WARM FINALLY TO NEAR 80 AHEAD OF THE FRONT                 
TUESDAY...A SLIGHT COOL DOWN WILL OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE                 
FRONT. MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED...SO MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS                  
ANTICIPATED.                                                                    
MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FCST. THE DRY NOVEMBER WEATHER                  
PATTERN LOOKS TO CONTINUE. BOTH GFS/ECMWF SHOW A GRADUAL WARMING                
TREND LATE IN THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND...WITH YET ANOTHER                 
COLD FRONT EXPECTED EITHER SUNDAY OR MONDAY...DEPENDING ON THE                  
MODEL...AND JUST TOO EARLY TO TELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME...BUT THE              
PARADE OF FRONTS LOOK TO CONTINUE.                                              
MARINE...DECIDED TO EXTEND THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR THE                     
ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING...AS GULF STREAM SEAS WILL                 
LIKELY NOT START SUBSIDING UNTIL LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT DUE TO              
THE FACT THAT WINDS WILL REMAIN FROM A MORE NE DIRECTION BEFORE                 
BECOMING EASTERLY LATER TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...WINDS OVER THE NEXT                
FEW DAYS WILL SLACKEN LEADING TO IMPROVING MARINE CONDITIONS. THE               
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY...SWITCHING                
WINDS TO W-NW...AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE                  
AREA TUE NIGHT INTO EARLY WED MORNING...WITH A BRIEF WIND SURGE                 
EXPECTED BEHIND IT...BUT GUIDANCE SUGGESTS ONLY 15-20 KT AND NOT                
TOO PROLONGED.                                                                  
FIRE WEATHER...RH`S HAVE BEEN DOWN AGAIN TO NEAR 40 PERCENT AS                  
SOME DRY AIR HAS MIXED DOWN. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE JUST A TAD                  
ON MONDAY. SLIGHT DRYING IS EXPECTED TUESDAY BEHIND A PRE-FRONTAL               
TROUGH...BUT NOT EXPECTED TO BE DRY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO RESULT               
IN CRITICAL RH`S. HOWEVER...WILL MONITOR TRENDS...BECAUSE TUE WILL              
BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK...AND IF MORE DRYING OCCURS BETWEEN              
THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT...THEN RH`S COULD              
FALL LOWER THAN FCST. THE DRIEST AIR WILL ADVECT IN ACROSS THE                  
AREA BEHIND THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. TRENDED DEW POINTS/RH`S                     
DOWN...THOUGH NOT AS LOW AS THE NAM AT THIS TIME...WHICH DROPS DEW              
POINTS TO THE LOWER 30S NW INTERIOR TO THE LOWER 40S SE. WE LIKELY              
WILL NEED TO CONTINUE A DECREASING TREND IN COMING FCSTS.

19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS CONTINUE TO SHOW A RATHER                   
COMPLEX UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA THIS AFTERNOON.                  
TWO LARGE UPPER LOWS SPINNING ACROSS WEST-CENTRAL CANADA AND OVER               
EASTERN QUEBEC REMAIN THE DOMINANT STEERING MECHANISMS FOR THE                  
NORTHERN STREAM. THIS FLOW DIVES INTO SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING ACROSS            
THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE                 
FIRST MENTIONED UPPER LOW. THE FLOW THEN BRIEFLY RIDGES UP THROUGH              
THE GREAT LAKES STATES BEFORE DIVING SOUTHEAST TO THE MID-ATLANTIC              
AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE UPPER LOW ACROSS EASTERN                   
CANADA. ABUNDANT SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE IS SEEN ON WV IMAGERY                 
CONTINUING TO STREAM NORTHWARD OVER MEXICO AND INTO THE SOUTHERN                
PLAINS. THIS MID-UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL HELP FUEL THE EVOLUTION              
OF THE SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS AS IT                       
AMPLIFIES INTO THE MS VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY.                                    
IN THE LOWER LEVELS...SURFACE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS FROM THE CAROLINA              
COAST SOUTHWEST INTO THE FORECAST AREA KEEPING THE GRADIENT RELAXED             
AND OUR WINDS LIGHT FROM THE EAST AND NORTHEAST THIS AFTERNOON. A               
MID-LEVEL AC DECK OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA EARLY THIS                  
MORNING RESULTED FROM AN IMPRESSIVE RIDGE OF ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE                 
BELOW 10KFT ARCHING FROM SOUTHERN LA ACROSS SOUTHERN MS/AL. THIS AC             
DECK HAS BROKEN UP SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE SUNRISE AND RETREATED BACK TO            
OUR FAR WESTERN SE AL ZONES AS THE BEST UPGLIDE FROM THIS MORNING               
HAS WEAKENED AND DRIFTED FURTHER NORTH. WITH PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY             
SKIES NOW IN CONTROL REGION-WIDE TEMPERATURES HAVE RESPONDED TO THE             
LOWER 60S NORTH AND INTO THE MIDDLE/UPPER 60S SOUTH.                            
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...                                  
SURFACE RIDGE WILL STILL BE IN CONTROL OF THE AREA TONIGHT...HOWEVER            
IT WILL BE WEAKENING. EASTERLY FLOW WILL SLOWLY COME AROUND TO THE              
SOUTHEAST ALLOWING FOR A SLOW INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. THIS              
MOISTURE ADVECTION COMBINED WITH A SLOW INCREASE IN CLOUDS FROM THE             
WEST SHOULD RESULT IN A WARMER OVERNIGHT PERIOD THAN HAS BEEN                   
EXPERIENCED THE PAST SEVERAL NIGHTS. IN FACT LOW TEMPERATURES                   
TONIGHT SHOULD BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOWER 40S FOR THE COLDEST LOCATIONS            
WITH UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S ALONG THE COAST FROM FRANKLIN COUNTY TO            
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.                                                          
THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY WILL BE WATCHING SHORTWAVE ENERGY                     
CURRENTLY OVER THE HIGH PLAINS DIVE SOUTHEAST. THIS ENERGY WILL BE              
RE-ENFORCED BY ANOTHER STRONG SHORTWAVE DROPPING OUT OF CENTRAL                 
CANADA TO PRODUCE A FAIRLY HIGH AMPLITUDE TROUGH ALONG THE MS VALLEY            
BY THE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. DEEP SYNOPTIC LIFT AHEAD OF THIS                
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL INTERACT WITH A WEAK LOW LEVEL FRONTAL              
BOUNDARY TO CONSOLIDATE LOW PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES               
THROUGH THE DAY. THIS WILL ALSO WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE TRAILING COLD            
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWARD TO THE LOWER MS VALLEY. AS THIS FRONT                 
PROGRESSES EASTWARD INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS...RAIN CHANCES IN THE              
FORM OF SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE INCREASING ACROSS             
THE NORTHWEST THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. AT THIS TIME THE BULK OF              
THE SHOWERS OVER THESE FAR WESTERN ZONES SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL THE              
LATER AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING HOURS. FURTHER EAST WILL SEE                   
INCREASING CLOUDS THROUGH THE DAY AFTER SOME MORNING SUN. COOLEST               
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED IN THE NORTHWEST ZONES WITH THE THICKER CLOUDS            
WHERE LOWER TO MIDDLE 60S WILL BE COMMON. FURTHER SOUTHEAST THERE               
WILL BE MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SIGNIFICANT WARMING AND TEMPS                
AROUND 70 ARE EXPECTED. DO ANTICIPATE ANOTHER COOLER POCKET DOWN                
ALONG THE FRANKLIN COUNTY COAST AS EASTERLY FLOW BRINGS COOLER AIR              
OFF THE SHELF WATERS OF APALACHEE BAY.                                          
COLD FRONT WILL CROSS THE FORECAST AREA FROM WEST TO EAST MONDAY                
NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL ENERGY ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE MAIN TROUGH IS               
SHEARED RAPIDLY OFF TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE NIGHT WITH ONLY A               
WEAK BAND OF DEEP LAYER SYNOPTIC LIFT CROSSING THROUGH. MAIN                    
SYNOPTIC LIFT WITH THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN MUCH FURTHER TO THE                 
NORTH ACROSS NORTHERN GA...THE CAROLINAS...AND MID-ATLANTIC STATES.             
GFS/NAM ALSO SHOWING A RATHER THIN MOISTURE AXIS AHEAD OF THE FRONT             
MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE AREA. THEREFORE...WILL FORECAST A                     
WEAKENING AND THINNING BAND OF SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ALONG             
AND AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. IN FACT ANY THUNDERSTORM ARE LIKELY TO BE              
CONFINED TO AREAS WEST OF THE APALACHICOLA RIVER...AND MAINLY                   
DURING THE EVENING HOURS. AFTER MIDNIGHT THUNDER SHOULD BE CONFINED             
TO THE COASTAL WATERS...IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE BEST INSTABILITY.            
WITH THIS IN MIND...THE HIGHEST POPS (LIKELY RANGE) ARE ACROSS THE              
WEST DURING THE EVENING HOURS AND THEN TAPER TO CHANCE POPS AFTER               
MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE EAST. AS THE BAND REACHES THE SUWANNEE RIVER                
VALLEY TOWARD SUNRISE TUESDAY...THIS BAND OF SHOWERS MAY BE                     
ESPECIALLY BRIEF IN NATURE WITH VERY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS.                       
ANY SHOWERS/SPRINKLES OVER THE SOUTHEAST BIG BEND WILL END EARLY                
TUESDAY MORNING AS THE FRONT PUSHES FURTHER SOUTH. HIGH PRESSURE                
WILL TAKE CONTROL EARLY AND THEN BUILDS OVERHEAD TUESDAY NIGHT INTO             
WEDNESDAY. LOOKING FOR A BREEZY AND COOL AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPS AROUND            
60 NORTH AND THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 60S SOUTH. WITH THE HIGH IN CLOSE              
PROXIMITY TUESDAY NIGHT AND DRY AIR ONCE AGAIN IN PLACE...THE STAGE             
SEEM SET FOR ANOTHER DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING EVENT. COLDER                   
INTERIOR SPOTS...ARE ONCE AGAIN ANTICIPATED TO APPROACH FREEZING                
WITH AREAS OF FROST DURING THE LATE NIGHT HOURS.                                
&&                                                                              
.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...                                        
THE VERY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN CONTINUES ACROSS THE SE U.S....AND                 
ANOTHER COLD AND DRY CANADIAN SFC RIDGE WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE CWA            
FOR WED AND THU...AS CONFIDENCE CONTINUES TO INCREASE THAT PORTIONS             
OF THE INTERIOR WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE A LIGHT FREEZE ON WED AND THU            
MORNINGS. THIS RIDGE WILL THEN MOVE QUICKLY OFF THE SE U.S.                     
COASTLINE ON FRIDAY...ALLOWING THE NEXT COLD FRONT TO PUSH THROUGH              
FRI NIGHT AND SAT MORNING. THIS SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO LOOK A BIT               
MORE POTENT WITH TIME...AND ALTHOUGH WE KEPT JUST SHOWERS IN THE                
GRIDS ON LAST NIGHT`S PACKAGE ...THIS LOW MAY HAVE JUST ENOUGH                  
RETURN FLOW MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS TO WORK WITH TO ALLOW SCT TSTMS TO            
BE INTRODUCED INTO THE FCST OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. THE 12 UTC             
RUN OF THE ECMWF HAS MORE OF A SPLIT FLOW SOLUTION WITH THIS                    
EVENT...AND THEREFORE HAS A WEAKER SFC SYSTEM AND LAGS THE COLD                 
FRONTAL PASSAGE UNTIL SAT NIGHT-SUN MORNING. BELIEVE THAT THE MORE              
CONTIGUOUS GFS EVOLUTION LOOKS BETTER AT THIS TIME...SO AM HOPING               
THE 00 UTC RUN OF THE ECMWF CONVERGES TOWARDS THIS PREFERRED                    
SOLUTION. IF NOT...WE`LL RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE SOME END OF SHIFT            
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END OF THE FCST PERIOD.

SURFACE RIDGE WEAKEN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST GULF TONIGHT ALLOWING                 
WINDS TO COME AROUND TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST BY MONDAY MORNING. A             
COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST DURING MONDAY AFTERNOON            
AND CROSSING THE FORECAST WATERS MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY                 
MORNING. EXPECT A SHARP SHIFT IN THE WINDS TO THE NORTH WITH AND                
INCREASE IN SPEED TO NEAR ADVISORY LEVELS AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE WILL PULL AWAY FROM THE MID ATLANTIC                
COAST TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...RESULTING IN OUR PREVAILING WINDS                
TURNING MORE EASTERLY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY...THOUGH                 
BELIEVE THE GFS/NAM ARE A BIT TOO BULLISH ON THIS. KEPT SLIGHT                  
CHANCE POPS NEXT FEW DAYS FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST...BUT OTHERWISE                
MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.                                     
MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE FCST IS AGAIN ON THE LAND BREEZE AND               
ITS EFFECTS ON TEMPS AGAIN TONIGHT...AND MONDAY NIGHT AS WELL.                  
GFS/NAM AND EVEN THE WRF DO NOT SHOW THE LAND BREEZE DEVELOPING                 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE PATTERN IS NOT CHANGING MUCH AND SO WE                   
BELIEVE IT WILL OCCUR. THE NAM/WRF LOOK WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH                 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...AND THEY START THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND                    
BREEZE EARLY ON BEFORE THE WINDS SURGE TAKES OVER SWITCHING WINDS               
BACK NE. SINCE THIS SURGE LOOKS TO AGGRESSIVE...DECIDED TO                      
DISCOUNT THIS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING IS                  
AGAIN EXPECTED IN A STILL RATHER DRY AIRMASS...DECIDED TO BRING                 
THE LAND BREEZE ACROSS MUCH OF THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS AGAIN                 
TONIGHT...BUT NOT QUITE TO THE COAST...REASON BEING THAT IT MADE                
IT TO THE COAST JUST FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING...AND ANY SLIGHT                  
INCREASE IN THE NE-E WIND OVERNIGHT WOULD HOLD IT AT BAY. SHOULD                
MENTION THAT THE RUC IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR                 
EXPECTATIONS TONIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACT THE FCST ON THE LAND BREEZE               
HAS IS WITH REGARDS TO TEMPS...AS IT CAN FLUCTUATE 5-10F DEGREES                
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY...AS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW                      
MORNING`S.                                                                      
KEPT PATCHY FOG IN THE FCST TONIGHT AND MON NIGHT. MON NIGHT LOOKS              
TO BE MOST OPTIMAL...AHEAD OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH.                             
GFS/ECMWF STILL SHOW THE COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY              
NIGHT INTO WED MORNING...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVING BY ON                 
TUESDAY. AFTER TEMPS WARM FINALLY TO NEAR 80 AHEAD OF THE FRONT                 
TUESDAY...A SLIGHT COOL DOWN WILL OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE                 
FRONT. MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED...SO MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS                  
ANTICIPATED.                                                                    
MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FCST. THE DRY NOVEMBER WEATHER                  
PATTERN LOOKS TO CONTINUE. BOTH GFS/ECMWF SHOW A GRADUAL WARMING                
TREND LATE IN THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND...WITH YET ANOTHER                 
COLD FRONT EXPECTED EITHER SUNDAY OR MONDAY...DEPENDING ON THE                  
MODEL...AND JUST TOO EARLY TO TELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME...BUT THE              
PARADE OF FRONTS LOOK TO CONTINUE.

.MARINE...DECIDED TO EXTEND THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR THE                    
ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING...AS GULF STREAM SEAS WILL                 
LIKELY NOT START SUBSIDING UNTIL LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT DUE TO              
THE FACT THAT WINDS WILL REMAIN FROM A MORE NE DIRECTION BEFORE                 
BECOMING EASTERLY LATER TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...WINDS OVER THE NEXT                
FEW DAYS WILL SLACKEN LEADING TO IMPROVING MARINE CONDITIONS. THE               
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY...SWITCHING                
WINDS TO W-NW...AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE                  
AREA TUE NIGHT INTO EARLY WED MORNING...WITH A BRIEF WIND SURGE                 
EXPECTED BEHIND IT...BUT GUIDANCE SUGGESTS ONLY 15-20 KT AND NOT                
TOO PROLONGED.

.FIRE WEATHER...RH`S HAVE BEEN DOWN AGAIN TO NEAR 40 PERCENT AS                 
SOME DRY AIR HAS MIXED DOWN. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE JUST A TAD ON               
MONDAY. SLIGHT DRYING IS EXPECTED TUESDAY BEHIND A PRE-FRONTAL                  
TROUGH...BUT NOT EXPECTED TO BE DRY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO RESULT               
IN CRITICAL RH`S. HOWEVER...WILL MONITOR TRENDS...BECAUSE TUE WILL              
BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK...AND IF MORE DRYING OCCURS BETWEEN              
THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT...THEN RH`S COULD              
FALL LOWER THAN FCST. THE DRIEST AIR WILL ADVECT IN ACROSS THE                  
AREA BEHIND THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. TRENDED DEWPOINTS/RH`S                      
DOWN...THOUGH NOT AS LOW AS THE NAM AT THIS TIME...WHICH DROPS                  
DEWPOINTS TO THE LOWER 30S NW INTERIOR TO THE LOWER 40S SE. WE                  
LIKELY WILL NEED TO CONTINUE A DECREASING TREND IN COMING FCSTS.

(TODAY AND TONIGHT) 13Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS SHOWING A               
RATHER COMPLEX UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA THIS MORNING.             
TWO LARGE UPPER LOWS SPINNING ACROSS WEST-CENTRAL CANADA AND OVER               
EASTERN QUEBEC ARE THE DOMINANT STEERING MECHANISMS FOR THE NORTHERN            
STREAM. THIS FLOW DIVES INTO SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING INTO THE UPPER             
PLAINS STATES AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE FIRST MENTIONED              
UPPER LOW. THE FLOW THEN BRIEFLY RIDGES UP THROUGH THE UPPER                    
MS/VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES STATES BEFORE DIVING SOUTHEAST TO THE                 
MID-ATLANTIC AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE EASTERN CANADIAN              
UPPER LOW. ABUNDANT SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE IS ALSO SEEN ON WV                 
IMAGERY STREAMING NORTHWARD FROM THE BAJA PENINSULA INTO THE                    
SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS MID-UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL HELP FUEL THE               
EVOLUTION OF THE SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY APPROACHING THE UPPER PLAINS AS            
IT AMPLIFIES INTO THE MS VALLEY DURING MONDAY.                                  
IN THE LOWER LEVELS...SURFACE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS FROM THE CAROLINA              
COAST SOUTHWEST INTO THE FORECAST AREA KEEPING THE GRADIENT RELAXED.            
WITH THE RIDGE AXIS IN PLACE AND COMBINED WITH DRY LOW LEVELS...                
EARLY MORNING TEMPERATURES WERE ABLE TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S TO              
MIDDLE 30S OVER A LARGE PORTION OF THE REGION BEFORE INCREASING                 
MID-LEVEL CLOUDS EXPANDED SOUTHEASTWARD AND DISRUPTED THE                       
RADIATIONAL COOLING PROCESS. THIS MID-LEVEL DECK IS RESULTING FROM A            
ZONE OF LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION TO OUR WEST AND CHARACTERIZED BY A             
RATHER IMPRESSIVE RIDGE OF ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE ALONG THE 290-300K                
SURFACES. REGIONAL RADARS ARE INDICATING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS/DRIZZLE             
FALLING OUT OF THIS MID-LEVEL DECK OVER SE ALABAMA AND SOUTHWEST                
GEORGIA...HOWEVER WITH SURFACE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS BETWEEN 10 AND              
15 DEGREES...WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MEASURABLE RAINFALL REACHING              
THE SURFACE. GFS/NAM IS AGREEMENT SHOWING THIS FEATURE SLOWLY                   
WEAKENING THROUGH THE DAY WHILE KEEPING THE RESULTING LIFT AND BEST             
CLOUD COVERAGE OVER THE NW HALF OF THE AREA.                                    
WITH THE SUN NOW UP...TEMPERATURES ARE ON THE RISE AREA-WIDE. UNDER             
THE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY MID-LEVEL DECK OVER THE NW ZONES TEMPS              
WILL BE A BIT COOLER TOPPING OUT IN THE UPPER 50S TO NEAR 60.                   
FURTHER SOUTHEAST UNDER PARTLY SUNNY SKIES...AFTERNOON HIGHS SHOULD             
EASILY REACH THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 60S.                                          
SURFACE RIDGE WILL STILL BE IN CONTROL OF THE AREA TONIGHT...HOWEVER            
IT WILL BE WEAKENING. EASTERLY FLOW WILL BE SLOWLY COMING AROUND TO             
THE SOUTHEAST WITH TIME ALLOWING FOR A STEADY INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL             
MOISTURE. THIS MOISTURE ADVECTION COMBINED WITH AT LEAST PARTLY                 
CLOUDY SKIES SHOULD RESULT IN A MUCH WARMER OVERNIGHT PERIOD THAN               
HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED THE PAST SEVERAL NIGHTS. IN FACT LOW                       
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT SHOULD BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOWER 40S FOR THE                 
COLDEST LOCATIONS WITH UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S ALONG THE COAST FROM

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS TO OUR NORTHEAST THROUGH THE NEXT 24

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FROM THE NORTHEAST IN ROUGHLY THE 10 TO 15 KNOT            
RANGE ALTHOUGH EXPECT WINDS TO DECREASE DURING THE AFTERNOON OVER               
APALACHEE BAY TO THE 5 TO 10 KNOT RANGE. SEAS REMAIN IN THE 2 TO 3              
FOOT RANGE AWAY FROM THE COAST. AS THE HIGH WEAKENS OVERNIGHT SHOULD            
SEE THE FLOW COME AROUND TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST. A COLD FRONT                
WILL THEN APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON MONDAY CROSSING THE FORECAST                
WATERS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING WITH A SHARP WIND SHIFT TO              
THE NORTH. A PERIOD OF ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS IS POSSIBLE TUESDAY AND             
TUESDAY NIGHT IN THE WAKE OF THIS FRONT BEFORE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS             
SOUTH TOWARD THE AREA WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

CENTERED NORTHEAST OF THE LOCAL FORECAST AREA WITH A RIDGE AXIS                 
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE REGION. IR2 IMAGERY AND                          
OBSERVATIONS SHOW A MID-LEVEL CLOUD DECK AROUND 10 KFT SHIFTING                 
SOUTHEAST TOWARD OUR SOUTHEAST ALABAMA COUNTIES THIS EVENING. AS A              
RESULT...WE DID AN UPDATE TO THE ZONES/GRIDS TO REFLECT THIS                    
COVERAGE OVER SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND PORTIONS OF THE EASTERN                     
FLORIDA PANHANDLE AROUND MIDNIGHT. ALSO DECREASED THE AREAS OF                  
FROST TO PATCHY OVER THESE AREAS AND SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE                     
OVERNIGHT LOWS OVER THESE COUNTIES. THE NAM12 PICKED UP ON THIS                 
INCREASE IN MID-LEVEL MOISTURE LATER TONIGHT AS WELL. KTLH                      
TEMPERATURE DROPPED FROM 49 TO 34 DEGREES OVER A TWO HOUR PERIOD                
THIS EVENING...WHICH IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST.               
THERE IS A DECENT DEWPOINT GRADIENT ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN BIG                 
BEND AND TEMPERATURES AT PERRY AND CROSS CITY ARE STILL IN THE MID              
40S. THE RUC SHOWS THESE HIGHER DEWPOINTS SPREADING NORTHWEST                   
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. THEREFORE...EXPECT THE

WELL...THIS CLOUDINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BELOW-MENTIONED                      
SHORTWAVE IS COMING IN A LITTLE MORE THAN EXPECTED. WILL SEND OUT               
AN UPDATE FOR BOTH SKY GRIDS AND MIN TEMPERATURE GRIDS. AM NOT                  
QUITE SURE HOW EXACTLY TO HANDLE MIN TEMPERATURES. TEMPS ALREADY                
DROPPING FAIRLY RAPIDLY BUT THE CLOUD COVER...WHICH ACCORDING TO                
BOTH THE RUC AND NAM12 SHOULD STAY IN A GOOD PORTION OF THE AREA                
ALL NIGHT...WOULD INHIBIT THE AMOUNT OF RADIATIONAL COOLING THAT                
WAS EARLIER EXPECTED. TOOK A GENERAL BLEND OF THE MAV AND THE MET               
FROM EARLIER TODAY ALONG WITH SOME NEW TEMPERATURE DATA...                      
HOPEFULLY IT ISN`T TOO MUCH OF A BUST ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. DIDN`T                
DO MUCH ADJUSTING OF SOUTHERN ZONES AS IT`LL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE               
CLOUDS TO GET THERE AND BY THAT POINT THE CLOUDS MAY BREAK UP.

SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...                                    
COLD...DRY HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE OVER THE REGION. ANOTHER COLD                 
NIGHT IN STORE FOR THE AREA...THOUGH AS THE AIRMASS IS MODIFYING                
SOMEWHAT IT SHOULDN`T BE QUITE AS COLD AS LAST NIGHT. NONETHELESS               
HAVE GONE ON THE COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE...GENERALLY WITH EITHER THE              
MAV OR FWC (AS A NOTE...FWC BEAT THE TAR OUT OF BOTH THE MAV AND                
MET LAST NIGHT). LIMITING FACTOR WILL BE THE WEAK SHORTWAVE IN THE              
FLOW ALOFT THAT MIGHT BRING SOME MID-LEVEL CLOUDINESS TO THE                    
REGION...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTH GEORGIA. AM NOT TOO EXCITED ABOUT              
THIS BUT JUST THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE SHORTWAVE STIRRING UP SOME               
MID-LEVEL MOISTURE...THE LACK OF COMPLETE SUBSIDENCE WILL KEEP US               
FROM BEING AS FRIGID AS LAST NIGHT.                                             
THE HIGH BEGINS TO PUSH OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST ON MONDAY AND WE                
GET SOME RETURN MOISTURE...NOT A WHOLE LOT THOUGH...TO THE REGION               
LATE ON SUNDAY. UPPER TROUGH PUSHES OFF THE ROCKIES DURING THE DAY              
ON SUNDAY AND WILL BEGIN TO WORK ITS WAY EAST. SHOULD WARM UP A                 
BIT DURING THE DAY...STILL BELOW NORMAL BUT AT LEAST IN THE 50S                 
JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE...PUSHING 60 IN SOUTHERN ZONES.                           
MONDAY NIGHT STARTS GETTING TRICKY AS FAR AS PRECIP GOES. CLOUD                 
COVER MOVING IN AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL PREVENT US FROM GETTING AS              
COLD AS PREVIOUS NIGHTS...AND PRECIP SHOULD NOT MOVE INTO                       
NORTHWEST GEORGIA UNTIL CLOSE TO SUNRISE. HOWEVER...AT LEAST IN                 
THE MOUNTAINS...TEMPS SHOULD STILL DROP BELOW FREEZING. IT IS                   
POSSIBLE...AS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GRIDS WITH THIS PACKAGE...               
THAT RAIN MAY MIX WITH SNOW OR SLEET IN THE MOUNTAINS EARLY MONDAY              
MORNING. GFS BUFR SOUNDINGS DO INDICATE A SLIGHT WARM NOSE SO AM                
INCLINED TO LEAN TOWARD SLEET...HOWEVER IF THE PROFILE HUGS THE                 
FREEZING LINE ENOUGH OR IF PRECIP RATES ARE HIGH ENOUGH IT`S                    
POSSIBLE IT COULD BRIEFLY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. TOO EARLY TO TELL                
AND IN ANY CASE NO ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE GROUND                   
TEMPS TOO WARM FOR NOW...BUT WILL ADJUST AS NECESSARY AS THE                    
FORECAST WARRANTS.                                                              
THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY                    
NIGHT. NOT SEEING A HUGE CHANCE OF WRAPAROUND SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY               
NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS AS THIS SHOULD MOVE THROUGH MONDAY EVENING               
BEFORE TEMPERATURES DROP. BUT IF ANY PRECIP ENDS UP LINGERING                   
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING THIS COULD CHANGE. HAVE LEFT IT OUT FOR                 
NOW. OVERALL NOT A HUGE RAIN MAKER...BUT WE`LL TAKE ANYTHING WE                 
CAN GET AT THIS POINT.                                                          
LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...                                         
PRECIP LINGERS IN SOUTHERN ZONES THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE                 
THE FRONT COMPLETELY MOVES THROUGH. UPPER LOW SPINS OVER NEW                    
ENGLAND FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVING US IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS              
ANOTHER COOL HIGH MOVES INTO PLACE. TEMPS BELOW NORMAL FOR MOST OF              
THE WEEK. ANOTHER UPPER SYSTEM DIGS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS LATE                
INT HE WEEK AS A LEE LOW DEVELOPS...DRAGGING A FRONT ACROSS THE                 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. AS MENTIONED YESTERDAY...THIS LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY              
INTERESTING SETUP FOR THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AS                
FAR AS WINTER WEATHER GOES. GFS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE ECMWF AND A            
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH THAN ITS PREVIOUS RUN. CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH IN              
THE EXACT SOLUTION BUT THE PATTERN SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT A FRONT               
WILL BE SWEEPING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH AND INTO OUR AREA OVER THE

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...                                   
COLD...DRY HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE OVER THE REGION. ANOTHER COLD                 
NIGHT IN STORE FOR THE AREA...THOUGH AS THE AIRMASS IS MODIFYING                
SOMEWHAT IT SHOULDN`T BE QUITE AS COLD AS LAST NIGHT. NONETHELESS               
HAVE GONE ON THE COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE...GENERALLY WITH EITHER THE              
MAV OR FWC (AS A NOTE...FWC BEAT THE TAR OUT OF BOTH THE MAV AND                
MET LAST NIGHT). LIMITING FACTOR WILL BE THE WEAK SHORTWAVE IN THE              
FLOW ALOFT THAT MIGHT BRING SOME MID-LEVEL CLOUDINESS TO THE                    
REGION...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTH GEORGIA. AM NOT TOO EXCITED ABOUT              
THIS BUT JUST THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE SHORTWAVE STIRRING UP SOME               
MID-LEVEL MOISTURE...THE LACK OF COMPLETE SUBSIDENCE WILL KEEP US               
FROM BEING AS FRIGID AS LAST NIGHT.                                             
THE HIGH BEGINS TO PUSH OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST ON MONDAY AND WE                
GET SOME RETURN MOISTURE...NOT A WHOLE LOT THOUGH...TO THE REGION               
LATE ON SUNDAY. UPPER TROUGH PUSHES OFF THE ROCKIES DURING THE DAY              
ON SUNDAY AND WILL BEGIN TO WORK ITS WAY EAST. SHOULD WARM UP A                 
BIT DURING THE DAY...STILL BELOW NORMAL BUT AT LEAST IN THE 50S                 
JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE...PUSHING 60 IN SOUTHERN ZONES.                           
MONDAY NIGHT STARTS GETTING TRICKY AS FAR AS PRECIP GOES. CLOUD                 
COVER MOVING IN AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL PREVENT US FROM GETTING AS              
COLD AS PREVIOUS NIGHTS...AND PRECIP SHOULD NOT MOVE INTO                       
NORTHWEST GEORGIA UNTIL CLOSE TO SUNRISE. HOWEVER...AT LEAST IN                 
THE MOUNTAINS...TEMPS SHOULD STILL DROP BELOW FREEZING. IT IS                   
POSSIBLE...AS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GRIDS WITH THIS PACKAGE...               
THAT RAIN MAY MIX WITH SNOW OR SLEET IN THE MOUNTAINS EARLY MONDAY              
MORNING. GFS BUFR SOUNDINGS DO INDICATE A SLIGHT WARM NOSE SO AM                
INCLINED TO LEAN TOWARD SLEET...HOWEVER IF THE PROFILE HUGS THE                 
FREEZING LINE ENOUGH OR IF PRECIP RATES ARE HIGH ENOUGH IT`S                    
POSSIBLE IT COULD BRIEFLY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. TOO EARLY TO TELL                
AND IN ANY CASE NO ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE GROUND                   
TEMPS TOO WARM FOR NOW...BUT WILL ADJUST AS NECESSARY AS THE                    
FORECAST WARRANTS.                                                              
THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY                    
NIGHT. NOT SEEING A HUGE CHANCE OF WRAPAROUND SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY               
NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS AS THIS SHOULD MOVE THROUGH MONDAY EVENING               
BEFORE TEMPERATURES DROP. BUT IF ANY PRECIP ENDS UP LINGERING                   
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING THIS COULD CHANGE. HAVE LEFT IT OUT FOR                 
NOW. OVERALL NOT A HUGE RAIN MAKER...BUT WE`LL TAKE ANYTHING WE                 
CAN GET AT THIS POINT.

THE FRONT COMPLETELY MOVES THROUGH. UPPER LOW SPINS OVER NEW                    
ENGLAND FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVING US IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS              
ANOTHER COOL HIGH MOVES INTO PLACE. TEMPS BELOW NORMAL FOR MOST OF              
THE WEEK. ANOTHER UPPER SYSTEM DIGS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS LATE                
INT HE WEEK AS A LEE LOW DEVELOPS...DRAGGING A FRONT ACROSS THE                 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. AS MENTIONED YESTERDAY...THIS LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY              
INTERESTING SETUP FOR THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AS                
FAR AS WINTER WEATHER GOES. GFS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE ECMWF AND A            
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH THAN ITS PREVIOUS RUN. CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH IN              
THE EXACT SOLUTION BUT THE PATTERN SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT A FRONT

TREASURE VALLEY STARTING AT 18Z BEFORE LIFTING OUT BY AFTER 21Z.                
THIS IS BASED ON PLACEMENT OF THE SURFACE HIGH WHICH IS FORECASTS TO            
MOVE INTO CENTRAL IDAHO BY 18Z THIS AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD SETUP A              
SE/NW PRESSURE GRADIENT FOR SOUTHEAST WINDS IN THE VALLEY.

CENTERED EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS...EXERTING ITS                       
INFLUENCE OVER MUCH OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. MEANWHILE...LOW               
PRESSURE AND AN ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM WAS BEGINNING TO COME                 
TOGETHER OVER THE HIGH PLAINS. A BROAD AREA OF SOUTHERLY FLOW WAS               
EVIDENT BETWEEN THESE TWO PRESSURE AREAS. ALOFT...A VIGOROUS SHORT              
WAVE WAS PULLING AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE OHIO VALLEY...            
WITH SHORT WAVE RIDGING BUILDING ACROSS THE MIDWEST IN ITS WAKE.                
NOT TOO MANY FORECAST CONCERNS THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS LOCAL                   
WEATHER PATTERN WILL GENERALLY BE QUIET BUT COOL. HOWEVER...THE                 
COMPLEX APPROACHING HIGH PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM...AND THE DRIVING                
UPPER WAVES...HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BRING PRECIPITATION TO THE                  
REGION LATER TONIGHT INTO MONDAY.                                               
00Z MODELS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH RESPECT               
TO FEATURES EXPECTED TO IMPACT FORECAST AREA. DESPITE THE GENERAL               
AGREEMENT IN THE OVERALL PATTERN...THERE IS SPREAD EVIDENT IN THE               
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES. FOR THE MOST PART...HAVE FOLLOWED A BLEND                
OF MODEL SOLUTIONS.                                                             
SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY...STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW               
IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE REGION TODAY INTO TONIGHT WITH THE APPROACH              
THE PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM...AS WELL AS THE PASSAGE OF SHORT WAVE                
RIDGE ALOFT. AS THESE UPSTREAM FEATURES MOVE CLOSER BY LATER                    
TONIGHT...A QUICK SHOT OF RELATIVELY STRONG WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT                 
WILL LIKELY PRODUCE SOME LIGHT RAINS. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS                 
SUGGEST MOISTURE DEPTH WILL BE LACKING...MAINLY BELOW 800 MB...SO               
EXPECT PRECIPITATION TOTALS TO BE MINIMAL.                                      
COLD FRONT AND DRIVING UPPER WAVE WILL CROSS THE REGION EARLY                   
MONDAY...QUICKLY BRINGING THE MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION THREAT TO                
AN END. SOUNDING PROFILES DRY OUT QUICKLY BEHIND THE FRONT...SO DO              
NOT REALLY EXPECT ANY POST FRONTAL PRECIPITATION MONDAY. HOWEVER...             
IF ANY DOES OCCUR...IT SHOULD FALL AS FLURRIES.                                 
ANOTHER UPPER WAVE...AND REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR...WILL CROSS              
THE REGION LATE MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY TUESDAY. NOT MUCH MOISTURE IS                
EXPECTED WITH THIS IMPULSE...BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A                
FEW FLURRIES AS THE ASSOCIATED THERMAL TROF SWINGS THROUGH.                     
LONG TERM...TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...QUIET/COOL CONDITIONS              
APPEAR LIKELY THROUGH THE PERIOD...THOUGH MODEL/ENSEMBLE SPREAD                 
SUGGESTS THIS IS FAR FROM A FORGONE CONCLUSION. SOME DEGREE OF                  
TROFFING IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ACROSS EASTERN CANADA/NORTHEAST UNITED           
STATES...WITH THE PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT HELPING TO                    
PROVIDE CHILLY AIR. A SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE...ARRIVING ANYWHERE                  
FROM THURSDAY INTO SATURDAY...MAY PHASE WITH THE EASTERN TROF OR                
LIFT ACROSS REGION IF TROFFING ENDS UP LIKE ONE OF THE WEAKER                   
MODEL SOLUTIONS. THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ULTIMATE                         
TIMING/TRACK OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE PRECLUDES A MENTION OF                 
PRECIPITATION IN THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

THIS SHORT WAVE WHILE SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WERE OVER THE                
WESTERN HALF OF IA FROM I-35 WEST. TEMPERATURES OVER CENTRAL IL                 
WERE IN THE UPPER 20S AND LOWER 30S...WITH PONTIAC UP TO 36F. LOW               
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER TEENS. SSE WINDS 8 TO 15 MPH WITH

DISSIPATE IT BY THE TIME THE SHORT WAVE MOVES INTO IL DURING THIS               
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING DUE TO VERY DRY LOW LEVELS. BUT

WEAKEN AS IT SWINGS SE ACROSS CENTRAL IL DURING THIS AFTERNOON AND

MAIN CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE WILL BE CHANCE AND TYPE OF PCPN TODAY                
AND THEN AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. CURRENTLY MODELS IN                    
FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH CURRENT SITUATION AND ARE CONSISTENT AT              
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.                                                        
NO REAL LONG TERM CONCERNS EXCEPT FOR TEMP FORECAST. LONG TERM                  
MODELS SEEM OK THROUGH WED NIGHT BUT THEN DIFFER TOWARD THE END OF              
THE WEEK. WILL LIKELY FOLLOW CURRENT LONG TERM FORECAST AND LET                 
NEXT SHIFT TAKE A LOOK AT LATER PERIODS.                                        
SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT                                         
CURRENT CLIPPER SYSTEM...LOCATED IN S.D. IS PRODUCING WAA CLOUD                 
COVER AHEAD OF IT AND ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER TO ITS SOUTH. RETURNS              
SHOWING UP ON RADAR LOOPS...BUT THIS LIKELY JUST MID CLOUDS AND                 
NOT PCPN...THOUGH CAN`T RULE OUT FLURRIES. OTHER PCPN IS OCCURRING              
NEAR THE SFC LOW IN S.D. AND AHEAD OF IT IN MN AND NRN IOWA.                    
BOTH GFS AND NAM-WRF MODELS FORECAST THIS SYSTEM TO DROP SOUTHEAST              
TOWARD THE AREA AND WEAKEN...BUT BOTH STILL BRING A 500MB TROUGH                
THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING. MODELS ALSO INDICATE GOOD                        
ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WITH CONDENSATION PRESSURE                 
DEFICITS OF LESS THAN 10. SO SHOULD BE PLENTY OF LIFT TO PRODUCE                
CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY PCPN. ONLY NEGATIVE IS MODEL SOUNDINGS LACK                 
THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NEEDED. HOWEVER...BELIEVE THIS TIME OF YEAR              
WITH TEMPS COLD...STRONG DYNAMIC SYSTEMS CAN STILL SQUEEZE OUT                  
PCPN DESPITE LACK OF MOISTURE. SO ACCOUNT OF THIS AND THE LACK OF               
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...WILL INCLUDE FLURRIES IN FORECAST FOR THIS                 
MORNING AND THEN CHANGE TO SPRINKLES AS TEMP WARM UP BY THIS                    
AFTERNOON. WEAKENED SYSTEM...CLOUD COVER AND ANY PCPN WILL BE EAST              
OF THE AREA TONIGHT AND AREA WILL REMAIN DRY THROUGH SUNDAY.                    
A STRONGER SFC SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP IN THE PLAINS SUNDAY AND MOVE                
INTO THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH HIGH PRSS TO THE SOUTHEAST                     
THROUGH TOMORROW...SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW SHOULD ADVECT PLENTY OF LOW               
LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE DEEPENING AS IT               
MOVES INTO THE AREA AND DYNAMICS WILL BE INCREASING. TEMPS WILL                 
ALSO BE WARMING IN THE UPPER LEVELS SO MOST PCPN SUNDAY NIGHT                   
SHOULD START AS RAIN. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDING INDICATE THE                     
POSSIBILITY OF A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY                 
NIGHT IN THE NORTH. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT AND 500MB TROUGH                  
WILL QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON.                         
HOWEVER...WITH THIS SYSTEM DEEPENING AS IT MOVES EAST...WRAP                    
AROUND CLOUDS WILL BE LIKELY AND WITH AREA BEING IN CYCLONIC FLOW               
WILL HAVE TO KEEP MENTION OF SLIGHT CHC OF RAIN/SNOW IN THE GRIDS.              
THIS WILL NOT APPEAR IN WORDING AT THIS TIME...BUT MAY GET                      
INCLUDED IN LATER FORECAST. REMAINDER OF SHORT TERM WILL BE DRY AS              
COLD HIGH PRSS BUILDS INTO THE PLAINS. WITH THIS SYSTEM DEEPENING               
ON MONDAY WILL HAVE TO INCREASE WIND GUSTS DURING THE DAY. BUFKIT               
MOMENTUM TRANSFER INDICATES POTENTIAL FOR GUSTS TO BETWEEN 25 AND               
30 MPH...SO WILL BE ADJUSTING WIND GUSTS GRIDS TO REFLECT THIS.                 
TEMPS WILL BEGIN TO WARM UP SOME TODAY BUT STILL REMAINING BELOW                
NORMAL. NORMAL TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS CAN BE EXPECTED                   
SUNDAY WITH STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW FORECAST. BELOW NORMAL TEMPS              
WILL BE SEE AGAIN ON MONDAY AFTER THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH.                      
LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY                                              
COLD HIGH PRSS WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE PLAINS AT THE BEGINNING                
OF THE PERIOD AND WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGH MOST OF THE                 
WEEK. THE SFC RIDGE WILL BE JUST TO THE EAST OF ILLINOIS THROUGH                
THURSDAY. SO TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW NORMAL AS THE FLOW REMAINS               
OUT OF THE NORTH. LATE IN THE PERIOD A SYSTEM DEVELOPS IN THE                   
SOUTH THAT MOVES TOWARD THE LOWER MISS VALLEY. GFS AND ECMWF SHOW               
SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THIS...BUT WILL LET NEXT FORECAST SHIFT TAKE              
A LOOK AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES AT THIS TIME. THEREFORE...DRY              
WEATHER EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR NOW. MEX GUIDANCE NUMBERS

SNOWS...AROUND A COUPLE INCHES...ARE EXPECTED IN THE POCAHONTAS-FORT            
DODGE-SAC CITY AREAS...WITH LESSOR AMOUNTS GENERALLY AN INCH OR LESS            
ELSEWHERE. CROSS SECTIONS INDICATE A 1-3 HOUR PERIOD OF DECENT LIFT             
IN THE DENDRITIC LAYER ACROSS THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE CWA AND              
SOME WEAK INSTABILITY ALOFT. THIS AREA IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED BY A                 
POSITIVE PV PRESSURE ADVECTION MAX THROUGH THE MORNING INTO EARLY               
AFTERNOON. FORCING WILL QUICKLY EXIT THE CWA TO THE EAST BY LATE                
AFTERNOON.

THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL LOOSE ITS IDENTITY BY THIS EVENING                
WITH THE STATE REMAINING UNDER SOUTHERLY FLOW ALONG WITH VERY DRY               
MID LEVELS IN PLACE. SOME STRATUS MAY PERSIST ESPECIALLY THIS                   
EVENING THOUGH IT SHOULD SCATTER BY MIDNIGHT. SUNDAY WILL WARMER                
WITH ABOVE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED. A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS WILL             
BE CONVERGING ON CENTRAL IOWA BY LATE SUNDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL                 
ENTER NORTHWEST IOWA WITH AND WILL BE MOISTURE STARVED. AT THE SAME             
TIME...A SURGE OF GULF MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTING NORTHWARD AND WILL              
REACH THE FAR SOUTHEAST SUNDAY EVENING. A STRATUS SHIELD WILL LIKELY            
BE LIFTING NORTH ALONG WITH THE MOISTURE WITH A MOISTURE DEPTH OF               
AROUND 5 KFT. DECENT LIFT IN THE MOIST LAYER WOULD SUGGEST SOME                 
DRIZZLE OR LIGHT RAIN IS POSSIBLE SUNDAY EVENING FOR A BRIEF PERIOD             
OVER THE SOUTHEAST. THE BOUNDARY FROM THE NORTHWEST WILL PUSH THE               
MOISTURE QUICKLY TO THE EAST ENDING PRECIPITATION CHANCES. HAVE                 
MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCES ALONG THE BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH WITH RAIN             
OR SNOW. LOW LEVELS REMAIN RELATIVELY WARM AND WET BULBS ABOVE 0 C              
THROUGH THE PERIOD OF PRECIPITATION CHANCES THEREFORE SNOW CHANCES              
WILL BE LIMITED.                                                                
NUMEROUS STRONG SYSTEMS PASSING SLOWING THROUGH THE FLOW NEXT WEEK.             
A STRONG CLOSED LOW WILL DROP SOUTH OUT OF MANITOBA AND THROUGH THE             
WESTERN GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN WINDY CONDITIONS             
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AND COLDER AIR SPILLING SOUTH. COULD                    
APPROACH WIND ADVISORY CONDITIONS OVER THE NORTHEAST MONDAY                     
AFTERNOON. FALLING TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO POSSIBLE BY MONDAY                     
AFTERNOON. THIS SYSTEM WILL THEN LINGER OVER THE NORTHEASTERN CONUS             
THROUGH MID WEEK. AS THIS OCCURS...ANOTHER STRONG SYSTEM WILL MOVE              
INTO THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST AND MOVE SLOWLY EAST. CURRENT FORECAST              
FOR MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH THANKSGIVING STILL ON TRACK THOUGH            
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THE WESTERN SYSTEM WILL BRING PRECIPITATION              
TO PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY. NO CHANGE TO THE

TONIGHT AND MONDAY...AT 20Z LEADING EDGE OF A COLD FRONT WAS PUSHING            
INTO THE NORTHWESTERN CORNER OF THE CWA.  THIS FRONT WILL CONTINUE              
TO PUSH SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING AND                    
OVERNIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL             
PLAINS THIS AFTERNOON.  DO NOT EXPECT ANY PRECIPITATION TO DEVELOP              
ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH OVERNIGHT AS DEEPER LOW                
LEVEL MOISTURE WAS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF THE CWA.  SHALLOW MOISTURE              
HAS ADVECTED INTO NORTHEASTERN KS...BUT DEEPER MOISTURE LOOKS FAIRLY            
WELL DEFINED BY STRATUS DECK EXTENDING FROM EASTERN OK THROUGH                  
SOUTHEASTERN KS AND INTO CENTRAL MO.  H850 PROFILER WINDS REMAIN                
VEERED AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD                    
FRONT...SO BELIEVE THE DEEPER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN                    
SOUTHEAST OF THE CWA.  CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AS THE                    
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES OVER THE CWA TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD CLEAR OUT              
QUICKLY DURING THE MORNING HOURS TOMORROW AS UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE             
BUILDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS THE WAVE EXITS TO THE SOUTHEAST.               
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT COOLER TOMORROW BEHIND THE COLD                      
FRONT...BUT THE COOLER AIRMASS IS EXPECTED TO BE MODIFIED BY THE

LOWER 50S FOR MOST LOCATIONS.

LO LVL FLOW TO THE AREA AND A NICE WARM UP FOR MID WEEK. NAM/EC ARE             
WARMER THAN THE GFS WITH H85 TMPS...AND GIVEN MOSTLY SUNNY

DURING THIS PERIOD.                                                             
NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE CWA WL COME IN THE THUR/FRI TIME FRAME.               
LARGE SPREAD IN GUIDANCE REMAINS WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT THERE ARE               
SOME NOTABLE TRENDS. GFS HAS BEEN TRENDING DRIER FOR OUR CWA DUE                
TO A STRONGER NRN STREAM INFLUENCE WITH THE UPPR LVL TROF OVR THE               
HUDSON BAY. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED IN THE CANADIAN...GEFS...AND                 
MANY OF THE GFS ENSEMBLES. IN ADDITION...THE 12Z EC IS ALSO                     
STRONGER WITH THIS NRN STRM INFLUENCE AND THUS DRIER. SINCE THE                 
UPSTRM ENERGY MOVG INTO THE WRN US LATE IN THE WEEK IS EXPECTED TO              
FORCE A RETROGRESSION OF THE UPPR AIR PATTERN...A STRONGER NRN                  
STRM INFLUENCE APPEARS REASONABLE. THUS WL GO MORE WITH THE GFS                 
MODEL DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AND START TO TREND DOWN                           
POPS...ESPECIALLY OVR THE NRN CWA. WL ALSO GO WITH AN ALL RAIN                  
EVENT WITH A LACK OF ANY REAL COLD AIR UNTIL FRI INTO SAT.                      
ONCE SYSTEM MOVES BY...THE WEEKEND FORECAST ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT              
AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINLY. IT APPEARS THE CWA SHLD BE MAINLY DRY                    
THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT TEMPERATURES ARE THE MAIN QUESTION. GIVEN              
THE STRONGER INFLUENCE OF THE NRN STRM...WLD PREFER TO TREND DOWN

ALTHOUGH LIKE LAST NIGHT THE GFS APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE WETTER AND              
FASTER THAN THE NAM. THUS HAVE TIMED THE PREVAILING POPS IN THE

08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED A SOMEWHAT            
PROGRESSIVE FLOW FROM THE PACIFIC ACROSS THE NORTHERN U.S....WHICH              
THEN SLOWS DOWN IN SE CANADA AND THE NORTHEAST U.S. WHERE A FAIRLY              
DEEP TROUGH EXISTS. WITHIN THE PROGRESSIVE FLOW...THERE ARE TWO                 
SHRTWV TROUGHS TO NOTE...ONE OVER IDAHO AND A SECOND MORE WRAPPED UP            
ONE CROSSING NRN SASKATCHEWAN. A THIRD...BUT MUCH WEAKER SHRTWV IS              
MAKING ITS WAY SE INTO NRN LAKE SUPERIOR...ON THE EAST SIDE OF AN               
UPPER RIDGE BEING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE SRN CANADA SHRTWV TROUGH.               
THIS WEAK SHRTWV IS NOT HAVING MUCH IMPACT BESIDES A FEW HIGH CLOUDS            
CROSSING THE EASTERN CWA...DUE TO DRY LOW TO MID-LEVEL AIR SEEN ON              
THE 00Z SOUNDINGS FROM APX AND GRB. THIS DRY AIR AND SOME CLEAR                 
SKIES...ALONG WITH LIGHT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE RIDGE...               
ALLOWED LOCATIONS IN DELTA COUNTY TO DROP TO NEAR ZERO DURING THE               
EVENING. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE HAS MOVED EAST...ALLOWING RETURN                   
SOUTHERLY FLOW TO BRING READINGS BACK UP. THE SOUTHERLY FLOW IS ALSO            
BRINGING SOME STRATUS WITH IT...NOW COVERING ALL OF MN INTO WRN WI              
AND WRN UPPER MI. 00Z INL SOUNDING SHOWS THE STRATUS WITH A                     
SATURATED LAYER BTWN 800-925MB...WHILE THE REST OF THE SOUNDING IS              
DRY. SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE EVEN OCCURRED AT GFK AT 03Z...BUT NO                 
OTHER FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED. OTHERWISE...THE WARM ADVECTION                
AHEAD OF THE SHRTWV IN CENTRAL CANADA IS NOT PRODUCING MUCH PCPN.               
850MB TEMPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADVECTION ARE DEFINITELY WARMER THAN            
THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE CWA...3C AT BIS AND 1C AT CYQD...COMPARED TO            
-8C AT CWPL AND -7C AT APX. FARTHER TO THE WEST WITH THE OTHER                  
SHRTWV TROUGH...SOME -SN IS CROSSING ERN MT.                                    
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... ISSUED AT 408 AM EST                                             
TODAY...UPPER TROUGH OVER SASKATCHEWAN IS PROGGED TO DEEPEN AND MOVE            
INTO MANITOBA BY 00Z MON. AS THE TROUGH MOVES EAST...THE BUILDING               
RIDGE OVER THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL MOVE OVER UPPER MI.                
SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE CWA DRY.               
HOWEVER...THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF SOME WARM ADVECTION LIGHT SNOW               
OCCURRING OVER LAKE SUPERIOR...POSSIBLY CLIPPING THE KEWEENAW...                
ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN GOING CHC POPS. OTHERWISE...LOW CLOUDS WILL MOVE             
OVER THE REST OF THE CWA. HAVE DECLINED TO MENTION ANY FREEZING                 
DRIZZLE AS SOUNDINGS DO NOT INDICATE MUCH LIFT WITHIN THE LOW                   
CLOUDS...AND THE FACT THAT VERY FEW FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED                  
UPSTREAM. WITH THE WARM ADVECTION...HIGHS SHOULD BE A BIT WARMER                
TODAY EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CLOUDS. HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV                   
GUIDANCE...WHICH SEEMS A BIT MORE REALISTIC GIVEN READINGS SEEN                 
UPSTREAM.                                                                       
TONIGHT...MODELS TAKE THE UPPER TROUGH IN MANITOBA SOUTHWARD AS IT              
BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH THE OTHER SHRTWV TROUGH COMING OUT OF THE               
NRN ROCKIES. BY 12Z MON...THE UPPER TROUGH IS IN FAR WRN ONTARIO AND            
MN...WHILE THE NRN ROCKIES TROUGH SHIFTS INTO IOWA AND NRN IL. WITH             
THE UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING THE CWA...MID-LEVEL HEIGHTS FALL (500MB            
DROP OF 90-120 METERS). MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE MORE AHEAD OF THE              
TROUGH AS WELL...SO THE HEIGHT FALLS ARE EXPECTED TO BREAK OUT LIGHT            
PCPN OVER THE CWA. SINCE THE OVERALL MOISTURE IS NOT PROGGED TO BE              
THAT GREAT...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 0.40 OF AN INCH              
OR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF LIQUID                 
EQUIVALENT IS EXPECTED. PCPN ON LAND SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF                   
SNOW...BUT WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS FROM THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW/GFS                 
SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SOME RAIN TO MIX IN...ESPECIALLY ON EASTERN               
SUPERIOR WHERE GREATER HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER OCCURS. SOME              
LAKE ENHANCEMENT COULD OCCUR LATE OUT WEST...WITH 850MB TEMPS SHOWN             
TO DROP TO -8 TO -10C AND WINDS TURNING NW BEHIND A SFC LOW CROSSING            
EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS...TEMPS WILL BE                    
DICTATED BY THE COLD ADVECTION OCCURRING DURING THE NIGHT. AGAIN...             
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MET/MAV GUIDANCE.                                             
MONDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF FAR WRN ONTARIO AND             
MN IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO INTERACT WITH THE SHRTWV TROUGH...WITH             
AN UPPER LOW SITUATED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE IWD AREA BY 00Z TUE. IT                
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SHRTWV TROUGH CROSSING NRN IL IS STILL                 
PRESENT...OVER INDIANA AND OHIO BY 00Z...SUGGESTING THAT THE TWO                
TROUGHS HAVE NOT PHASED YET. NONETHELESS...THE SFC LOW THAT WAS                 
CROSSING INTO ERN LAKE SUPERIOR REDEVELOPS AND STRENGTHENS TO AROUND            
1005MB NEAR DTX AT 00Z. THE TRACK OF THE LOW MEANS AN INCREASING NW             
TO NORTH WIND THROUGH THE DAY...ALLOWING CONTINUED COOLING OF THE               
AIR OVER THE CWA. HOWEVER...850MB TEMPS GENERALLY ONLY DROP TO                  
AROUND -8C ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA. BETTER COOLING...DOWN TO -12 TO               
-14C...STAYS OUT TO THE WEST OVER MN...THOUGH -8C IS SUFFICIENT                 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SOME LAKE EFFECT CLOUDS OR LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. THE            
GREATEST PROBABILITY FOR THAT TO OCCUR WOULD BE IN THE EASTERN CWA              
WHICH WILL STILL BE IN A HEIGHT FALL SCENARIO EAST OF THE UPPER LOW.            
IN FACT...HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO LIKELY IN THIS AREA.                     
ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR TWO SHOULD BE THE RULE WITH                  
SOUNDINGS SUGGESTING WET SNOW. SOME OF THE SNOW AGAIN COULD MIX WITH            
RAIN OVER THE WATER AND EVEN ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR                    
SHORELINE...WITH THE INCREASING WIND PRODUCING MORE HEAT FLUX. GIVEN            
THE COLD ADVECTION AND PLENTY OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER               
LOW AND OFF LAKE SUPERIOR...TEMPS MAY STRUGGLE TO RISE MUCH...MAYBE             
ABOUT 10 DEGREES. WARMEST AREAS EXPECTED IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL WITH              
NW WINDS DOWNSLOPING AND ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR SHORELINE.             
MON NIGHT INTO TUE...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER              
LOW QUICKLY TO THE SE...REACHING LAKE ERIE BY 12Z TUE AND THEN TO               
NEW YORK STATE BY 00Z WED. THIS MEANS GRADUAL HEIGHT RISES ALOFT                
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH IS NOTED BY RH FIELDS SHOWING DRY                    
ADVECTION ALOFT AS SUBSIDENCE INCREASES. HOWEVER...MOIST COOL LOW               
LEVEL AIR BEING DRIVEN SOUTH MON NIGHT WILL MEAN A FAVORABLE LAKE               
ENHANCED/UPSLOPE SETUP. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY IN THE FAVORED            
NORTHERLY FLOW AREAS...IN ADDITION TO THE SE U.P. SINCE THE WINDS               
ARE PROGGED TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DRIVE ENHANCED BANDS INLAND. PCPN            
SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW...THOUGH POSSIBLY MIXED WITH RAIN IN              
THE EVENING NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR UNTIL ENOUGH COOLING CAN TAKE PLACE              
TO SWITCH IT ALL TO SNOW. GREATEST AMOUNT OF PCPN EXPECTED IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL U.P....BUT LOW SNOW TO WATER                 
RATIOS (10 TO 1 OR POSSIBLY EVEN LESS) SUGGESTS ONLY AN INCH OR TWO             
OF ACCUMULATION. PCPN SHOULD DIMINISH WEST TO EAST SOMEWHAT THROUGH             
THE DAY ON TUE...ENOUGH THAT POPS REMAIN IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY...              
THOUGH STILL HIGH IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF MQT/ALGER COUNTIES.                   
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM MAY DRY OUT ENOUGH...                  
PARTICULARLY FROM THE NAM...THAT THE SNOW COULD CHANGE TO DZ IN THE             
AFTN. DAY SHIFT WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN TO SEE IF MODELS                
TREND TOWARDS THIS IDEA. TEMPERATURE WISE...READINGS SHOULD NOT GET             
TOO CHILLY MON NIGHT THANKS TO CLOUDS AND WIND. MOST LOCATIONS                  
SHOULD FALL INTO THE 20S...AND THOSE NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR MAY ONLY                
BOTTOM OUT AT 30. THE CLIMB ON TUE EXPECTED AGAIN OF 5 TO 10                    
DEGREES...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING.                               
TUE NIGHT INTO WED...MAIN CONCERN FOR THIS PERIOD IS FZDZ. UPPER                
TROUGH/LOW REMAIN GENERALLY IN PLACE OVER NEW YORK STATE OR JUST                
MOVING SLIGHTLY NORTH INTO EASTERN ONTARIO DURING THIS PERIOD. RH               
PROFILES SHOW CONTINUED DRY ADVECTION ALOFT AND LOWERING                        
INVERSIONS...WHICH RESULTS IN TRAPPED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DURING THIS            
PERIOD. AT THE SFC...THE AREA IS STUCK BETWEEN A RIDGE BUILDING IN              
FROM MN AND A LOW IN EASTERN ONTARIO ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER                  
LOW...RESULTING IN CONTINUED NORTH TO NW WINDS OVER THE CWA. WITH               
THE LOW CLOUDS AND THE WIND DIRECTION...ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT                
900MB TEMPS AROUND -8C ARE FAVORABLE FOR LAKE ENHANCEMENT...SOME                
LIGHT PCPN IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN UPSLOPE AREAS. SOUNDINGS                 
SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM WILL DRY OUT...WHICH MEANS EITHER                
FZDZ OR -SHSN ARE POSSIBLE. HAVE INCLUDED THE FZDZ NOW ONLY IN                  
UPSLOPE AREAS WHERE THE GREATER PROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING EXISTS.             
FUTURE SHIFTS WILL NEED TO SEE IF FZDZ IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE. THE                 
CHANCES FOR -SHSN/FZDZ ARE CONFINED TO TUE NIGHT THROUGH WED                    
MORNING. AFTER WED MORNING...IT APPEARS THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH                  
DRYING BOTH BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ALOFT TO END THE NEED FOR CHANCE               
POPS. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW...WITH SUGGESTIONS BY             
THE ECMWF OF IT ROTATING BACK FARTHER WEST FOR THE NEED TO INCLUDE              
POPS FOR THE EASTERN CWA. TEMPS TUE NIGHT EXPECTED TO BE A FEW                  
DEGREES COOLER THAN MON NIGHT...COLDEST IN FAR WRN UPPER MI CLOSER              
TO THE SFC RIDGE. HIGHS ON WED SHOULD BE CLOSE TO NORMAL.                       
BEYOND WED...NO CHANGES MADE. LOOKS LIKE IN THE MEAN FROM THE 00Z               
ECMWF/GFS/GFS ENSEMBLES THAT THE CWA WILL REMAIN IN UPPER TROUGH                
THROUGH THE NEXT 7 TO 10 DAYS. OVER TIME...THE TROUGHING GETS                   
COOLER...BUT REALLY NOTHING TOO COLD EVIDENT.

OTHER THAN VFR CONDITIONS TO START THE PERIOD AT SAW...MVFR CIGS                
SHOULD PREVAIL AT KCMX/KSAW THROUGH THIS FORECAST PERIOD. A TROUGH              
WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE CWA TONIGHT...POSSIBLY BRINGING IFR TO LOW END            
MVFR -SN. THEN...AS NORTHWEST TO NORTHERLY FLOW SETS UP AND COLD AIR            
MOVES IN ALOFT...-SHSN WILL BECOME POSSIBLE...MAINLY AT CMX AFTER               
15Z.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
WITH LOW PRES DROPPING SE TOWARD THE UPPER LAKES TODAY...EXPECT                 
SWRLY WINDS ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR IN THE 15-25KT RANGE WITH GUSTS TO             
30KT. AS THE LOW SETTLES SE TOWARD THE LOWER LAKES...REORGANIZES AND            
STRENGTHENS SOME...EXPECT NRLY WINDS IN THE 15-30KT RANGE LATE MON              
AFTN THRU TUE WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF OF THE LAKE.             
IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS COULD                   
OCCUR...BUT SINCE COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK...WILL HOLD OFF ON A               
MENTION OF GALES AT THIS TIME. WINDS WILL VERY SLOWLY DIMINISH                  
WED/THU AS PROGRESSION OF SYSTEMS SLOWS TO A CRAWL. STRONGEST WINDS

UPDATED AVIATION DISCUSSION FOR 12Z TAF ISSUANCE                                
.SYNOPSIS... ISSUED AT 408 AM EST                                               
08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED A SOMEWHAT            
PROGRESSIVE FLOW FROM THE PACIFIC ACROSS THE NORTHERN U.S....WHICH              
THEN SLOWS DOWN IN SE CANADA AND THE NORTHEAST U.S. WHERE A FAIRLY              
DEEP TROUGH EXISTS. WITHIN THE PROGRESSIVE FLOW...THERE ARE TWO                 
SHRTWV TROUGHS TO NOTE...ONE OVER IDAHO AND A SECOND MORE WRAPPED UP            
ONE CROSSING NRN SASKATCHEWAN. A THIRD...BUT MUCH WEAKER SHRTWV IS              
MAKING ITS WAY SE INTO NRN LAKE SUPERIOR...ON THE EAST SIDE OF AN               
UPPER RIDGE BEING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE SRN CANADA SHRTWV TROUGH.               
THIS WEAK SHRTWV IS NOT HAVING MUCH IMPACT BESIDES A FEW HIGH CLOUDS            
CROSSING THE EASTERN CWA...DUE TO DRY LOW TO MID-LEVEL AIR SEEN ON              
THE 00Z SOUNDINGS FROM APX AND GRB. THIS DRY AIR AND SOME CLEAR                 
SKIES...ALONG WITH LIGHT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE RIDGE...               
ALLOWED LOCATIONS IN DELTA COUNTY TO DROP TO NEAR ZERO DURING THE               
EVENING. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE HAS MOVED EAST...ALLOWING RETURN                   
SOUTHERLY FLOW TO BRING READINGS BACK UP. THE SOUTHERLY FLOW IS ALSO            
BRINGING SOME STRATUS WITH IT...NOW COVERING ALL OF MN INTO WRN WI              
AND WRN UPPER MI. 00Z INL SOUNDING SHOWS THE STRATUS WITH A                     
SATURATED LAYER BTWN 800-925MB...WHILE THE REST OF THE SOUNDING IS              
DRY. SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE EVEN OCCURRED AT GFK AT 03Z...BUT NO                 
OTHER FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED. OTHERWISE...THE WARM ADVECTION                
AHEAD OF THE SHRTWV IN CENTRAL CANADA IS NOT PRODUCING MUCH PCPN.               
850MB TEMPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADVECTION ARE DEFINITELY WARMER THAN            
THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE CWA...3C AT BIS AND 1C AT CYQD...COMPARED TO            
-8C AT CWPL AND -7C AT APX. FARTHER TO THE WEST WITH THE OTHER                  
SHRTWV TROUGH...SOME -SN IS CROSSING ERN MT.                                    
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... ISSUED AT 408 AM EST                                             
TODAY...UPPER TROUGH OVER SASKATCHEWAN IS PROGGED TO DEEPEN AND MOVE            
INTO MANITOBA BY 00Z MON. AS THE TROUGH MOVES EAST...THE BUILDING               
RIDGE OVER THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL MOVE OVER UPPER MI.                
SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE CWA DRY.               
HOWEVER...THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF SOME WARM ADVECTION LIGHT SNOW               
OCCURRING OVER LAKE SUPERIOR...POSSIBLY CLIPPING THE KEWEENAW...                
ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN GOING CHC POPS. OTHERWISE...LOW CLOUDS WILL MOVE             
OVER THE REST OF THE CWA. HAVE DECLINED TO MENTION ANY FREEZING                 
DRIZZLE AS SOUNDINGS DO NOT INDICATE MUCH LIFT WITHIN THE LOW                   
CLOUDS...AND THE FACT THAT VERY FEW FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED                  
UPSTREAM. WITH THE WARM ADVECTION...HIGHS SHOULD BE A BIT WARMER                
TODAY EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CLOUDS. HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV                   
GUIDANCE...WHICH SEEMS A BIT MORE REALISTIC GIVEN READINGS SEEN                 
UPSTREAM.                                                                       
TONIGHT...MODELS TAKE THE UPPER TROUGH IN MANITOBA SOUTHWARD AS IT              
BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH THE OTHER SHRTWV TROUGH COMING OUT OF THE               
NRN ROCKIES. BY 12Z MON...THE UPPER TROUGH IS IN FAR WRN ONTARIO AND            
MN...WHILE THE NRN ROCKIES TROUGH SHIFTS INTO IOWA AND NRN IL. WITH             
THE UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING THE CWA...MID-LEVEL HEIGHTS FALL (500MB            
DROP OF 90-120 METERS). MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE MORE AHEAD OF THE              
TROUGH AS WELL...SO THE HEIGHT FALLS ARE EXPECTED TO BREAK OUT LIGHT            
PCPN OVER THE CWA. SINCE THE OVERALL MOISTURE IS NOT PROGGED TO BE              
THAT GREAT...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 0.40 OF AN INCH              
OR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF LIQUID                 
EQUIVALENT IS EXPECTED. PCPN ON LAND SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF                   
SNOW...BUT WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS FROM THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW/GFS                 
SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SOME RAIN TO MIX IN...ESPECIALLY ON EASTERN               
SUPERIOR WHERE GREATER HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER OCCURS. SOME              
LAKE ENHANCEMENT COULD OCCUR LATE OUT WEST...WITH 850MB TEMPS SHOWN             
TO DROP TO -8 TO -10C AND WINDS TURNING NW BEHIND A SFC LOW CROSSING            
EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS...TEMPS WILL BE                    
DICTATED BY THE COLD ADVECTION OCCURRING DURING THE NIGHT. AGAIN...             
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MET/MAV GUIDANCE.                                             
MONDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF FAR WRN ONTARIO AND             
MN IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO INTERACT WITH THE SHRTWV TROUGH...WITH             
AN UPPER LOW SITUATED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE IWD AREA BY 00Z TUE. IT                
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SHRTWV TROUGH CROSSING NRN IL IS STILL                 
PRESENT...OVER INDIANA AND OHIO BY 00Z...SUGGESTING THAT THE TWO                
TROUGHS HAVE NOT PHASED YET. NONETHELESS...THE SFC LOW THAT WAS                 
CROSSING INTO ERN LAKE SUPERIOR REDEVELOPS AND STRENGTHENS TO AROUND            
1005MB NEAR DTX AT 00Z. THE TRACK OF THE LOW MEANS AN INCREASING NW             
TO NORTH WIND THROUGH THE DAY...ALLOWING CONTINUED COOLING OF THE               
AIR OVER THE CWA. HOWEVER...850MB TEMPS GENERALLY ONLY DROP TO                  
AROUND -8C ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA. BETTER COOLING...DOWN TO -12 TO               
-14C...STAYS OUT TO THE WEST OVER MN...THOUGH -8C IS SUFFICIENT                 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SOME LAKE EFFECT CLOUDS OR LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. THE            
GREATEST PROBABILITY FOR THAT TO OCCUR WOULD BE IN THE EASTERN CWA              
WHICH WILL STILL BE IN A HEIGHT FALL SCENARIO EAST OF THE UPPER LOW.            
IN FACT...HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO LIKELY IN THIS AREA.                     
ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR TWO SHOULD BE THE RULE WITH                  
SOUNDINGS SUGGESTING WET SNOW. SOME OF THE SNOW AGAIN COULD MIX WITH            
RAIN OVER THE WATER AND EVEN ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR                    
SHORELINE...WITH THE INCREASING WIND PRODUCING MORE HEAT FLUX. GIVEN            
THE COLD ADVECTION AND PLENTY OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER               
LOW AND OFF LAKE SUPERIOR...TEMPS MAY STRUGGLE TO RISE MUCH...MAYBE             
ABOUT 10 DEGREES. WARMEST AREAS EXPECTED IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL WITH              
NW WINDS DOWNSLOPING AND ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR SHORELINE.             
MON NIGHT INTO TUE...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER              
LOW QUICKLY TO THE SE...REACHING LAKE ERIE BY 12Z TUE AND THEN TO               
NEW YORK STATE BY 00Z WED. THIS MEANS GRADUAL HEIGHT RISES ALOFT                
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH IS NOTED BY RH FIELDS SHOWING DRY                    
ADVECTION ALOFT AS SUBSIDENCE INCREASES. HOWEVER...MOIST COOL LOW               
LEVEL AIR BEING DRIVEN SOUTH MON NIGHT WILL MEAN A FAVORABLE LAKE               
ENHANCED/UPSLOPE SETUP. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY IN THE FAVORED            
NORTHERLY FLOW AREAS...IN ADDITION TO THE SE U.P. SINCE THE WINDS               
ARE PROGGED TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DRIVE ENHANCED BANDS INLAND. PCPN            
SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW...THOUGH POSSIBLY MIXED WITH RAIN IN              
THE EVENING NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR UNTIL ENOUGH COOLING CAN TAKE PLACE              
TO SWITCH IT ALL TO SNOW. GREATEST AMOUNT OF PCPN EXPECTED IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL U.P....BUT LOW SNOW TO WATER                 
RATIOS (10 TO 1 OR POSSIBLY EVEN LESS) SUGGESTS ONLY AN INCH OR TWO             
OF ACCUMULATION. PCPN SHOULD DIMINISH WEST TO EAST SOMEWHAT THROUGH             
THE DAY ON TUE...ENOUGH THAT POPS REMAIN IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY...              
THOUGH STILL HIGH IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF MQT/ALGER COUNTIES.                   
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM MAY DRY OUT ENOUGH...                  
PARTICULARLY FROM THE NAM...THAT THE SNOW COULD CHANGE TO DZ IN THE             
AFTN. DAY SHIFT WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN TO SEE IF MODELS                
TREND TOWARDS THIS IDEA. TEMPERATURE WISE...READINGS SHOULD NOT GET             
TOO CHILLY MON NIGHT THANKS TO CLOUDS AND WIND. MOST LOCATIONS                  
SHOULD FALL INTO THE 20S...AND THOSE NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR MAY ONLY                
BOTTOM OUT AT 30. THE CLIMB ON TUE EXPECTED AGAIN OF 5 TO 10                    
DEGREES...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING.

FROM MN AND A LOW IN EASTERN ONTARIO ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER                  
LOW...RESULTING IN CONTINUED NORTH TO NW WINDS OVER THE CWA. WITH               
THE LOW CLOUDS AND THE WIND DIRECTION...ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT                
900MB TEMPS AROUND -8C ARE FAVORABLE FOR LAKE ENHANCEMENT...SOME                
LIGHT PCPN IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN UPSLOPE AREAS. SOUNDINGS                 
SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM WILL DRY OUT...WHICH MEANS EITHER                
FZDZ OR -SHSN ARE POSSIBLE. HAVE INCLUDED THE FZDZ NOW ONLY IN                  
UPSLOPE AREAS WHERE THE GREATER PROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING EXISTS.             
FUTURE SHIFTS WILL NEED TO SEE IF FZDZ IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE. THE                 
CHANCES FOR -SHSN/FZDZ ARE CONFINED TO TUE NIGHT THROUGH WED                    
MORNING. AFTER WED MORNING...IT APPEARS THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH                  
DRYING BOTH BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ALOFT TO END THE NEED FOR CHANCE               
POPS. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW...WITH SUGGESTIONS BY             
THE ECMWF OF IT ROTATING BACK FARTHER WEST FOR THE NEED TO INCLUDE              
POPS FOR THE EASTERN CWA. TEMPS TUE NIGHT EXPECTED TO BE A FEW                  
DEGREES COOLER THAN MON NIGHT...COLDEST IN FAR WRN UPPER MI CLOSER              
TO THE SFC RIDGE. HIGHS ON WED SHOULD BE CLOSE TO NORMAL.                       
BEYOND WED...NO CHANGES MADE. LOOKS LIKE IN THE MEAN FROM THE 00Z               
ECMWF/GFS/GFS ENSEMBLES THAT THE CWA WILL REMAIN IN UPPER TROUGH                
THROUGH THE NEXT 7 TO 10 DAYS. OVER TIME...THE TROUGHING GETS                   
COOLER...BUT REALLY NOTHING TOO COLD EVIDENT.

IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS COULD                   
OCCUR...BUT SINCE COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK...WILL HOLD OFF ON A               
MENTION OF GALES AT THIS TIME. WINDS WILL VERY SLOWLY DIMINISH

08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED A SOMEWHAT            
PROGRESSIVE FLOW FROM THE PACIFIC ACROSS THE NORTHERN U.S....WHICH              
THEN SLOWS DOWN IN SE CANADA AND THE NORTHEAST U.S. WHERE A FAIRLY              
DEEP TROUGH EXISTS. WITHIN THE PROGRESSIVE FLOW...THERE ARE TWO                 
SHRTWV TROUGHS TO NOTE...ONE OVER IDAHO AND A SECOND MORE WRAPPED UP            
ONE CROSSING NRN SASKATCHEWAN. A THIRD...BUT MUCH WEAKER SHRTWV IS              
MAKING ITS WAY SE INTO NRN LAKE SUPERIOR...ON THE EAST SIDE OF AN               
UPPER RIDGE BEING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE SRN CANADA SHRTWV TROUGH.               
THIS WEAK SHRTWV IS NOT HAVING MUCH IMPACT BESIDES A FEW HIGH CLOUDS            
CROSSING THE EASTERN CWA...DUE TO DRY LOW TO MID-LEVEL AIR SEEN ON              
THE 00Z SOUNDINGS FROM APX AND GRB. THIS DRY AIR AND SOME CLEAR                 
SKIES...ALONG WITH LIGHT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE RIDGE...               
ALLOWED LOCATIONS IN DELTA COUNTY TO DROP TO NEAR ZERO DURING THE               
EVENING. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE HAS MOVED EAST...ALLOWING RETURN                   
SOUTHERLY FLOW TO BRING READINGS BACK UP. THE SOUTHERLY FLOW IS ALSO            
BRINGING SOME STRATUS WITH IT...NOW COVERING ALL OF MN INTO WRN WI              
AND WRN UPPER MI. 00Z INL SOUNDING SHOWS THE STRATUS WITH A                     
SATURATED LAYER BTWN 800-925MB...WHILE THE REST OF THE SOUNDING IS              
DRY. SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE EVEN OCCURRED AT GFK AT 03Z...BUT NO                 
OTHER FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED. OTHERWISE...THE WARM ADVECTION                
AHEAD OF THE SHRTWV IN CENTRAL CANADA IS NOT PRODUCING MUCH PCPN.               
850MB TEMPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADVECTION ARE DEFINITELY WARMER THAN            
THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE CWA...3C AT BIS AND 1C AT CYQD...COMPARED TO            
-8C AT CWPL AND -7C AT APX. FARTHER TO THE WEST WITH THE OTHER

TODAY...UPPER TROUGH OVER SASKATCHEWAN IS PROGGED TO DEEPEN AND MOVE            
INTO MANITOBA BY 00Z MON. AS THE TROUGH MOVES EAST...THE BUILDING               
RIDGE OVER THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL MOVE OVER UPPER MI.                
SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE CWA DRY.               
HOWEVER...THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF SOME WARM ADVECTION LIGHT SNOW               
OCCURRING OVER LAKE SUPERIOR...POSSIBLY CLIPPING THE KEWEENAW...                
ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN GOING CHC POPS. OTHERWISE...LOW CLOUDS WILL MOVE             
OVER THE REST OF THE CWA. HAVE DECLINED TO MENTION ANY FREEZING                 
DRIZZLE AS SOUNDINGS DO NOT INDICATE MUCH LIFT WITHIN THE LOW                   
CLOUDS...AND THE FACT THAT VERY FEW FZDZ REPORTS HAVE OCCURRED                  
UPSTREAM. WITH THE WARM ADVECTION...HIGHS SHOULD BE A BIT WARMER                
TODAY EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CLOUDS. HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV                   
GUIDANCE...WHICH SEEMS A BIT MORE REALISTIC GIVEN READINGS SEEN                 
UPSTREAM.                                                                       
TONIGHT...MODELS TAKE THE UPPER TROUGH IN MANITOBA SOUTHWARD AS IT              
BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH THE OTHER SHRTWV TROUGH COMING OUT OF THE               
NRN ROCKIES. BY 12Z MON...THE UPPER TROUGH IS IN FAR WRN ONTARIO AND            
MN...WHILE THE NRN ROCKIES TROUGH SHIFTS INTO IOWA AND NRN IL. WITH             
THE UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING THE CWA...MID-LEVEL HEIGHTS FALL (500MB            
DROP OF 90-120 METERS). MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE MORE AHEAD OF THE              
TROUGH AS WELL...SO THE HEIGHT FALLS ARE EXPECTED TO BREAK OUT LIGHT            
PCPN OVER THE CWA. SINCE THE OVERALL MOISTURE IS NOT PROGGED TO BE              
THAT GREAT...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 0.40 OF AN INCH              
OR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF LIQUID                 
EQUIVALENT IS EXPECTED. PCPN ON LAND SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF                   
SNOW...BUT WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS FROM THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW/GFS                 
SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SOME RAIN TO MIX IN...ESPECIALLY ON EASTERN               
SUPERIOR WHERE GREATER HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER OCCURS. SOME              
LAKE ENHANCEMENT COULD OCCUR LATE OUT WEST...WITH 850MB TEMPS SHOWN             
TO DROP TO -8 TO -10C AND WINDS TURNING NW BEHIND A SFC LOW CROSSING            
EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS...TEMPS WILL BE                    
DICTATED BY THE COLD ADVECTION OCCURRING DURING THE NIGHT. AGAIN...             
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MET/MAV GUIDANCE.                                             
MONDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF FAR WRN ONTARIO AND             
MN IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO INTERACT WITH THE SHRTWV TROUGH...WITH             
AN UPPER LOW SITUATED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE IWD AREA BY 00Z TUE. IT                
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SHRTWV TROUGH CROSSING NRN IL IS STILL                 
PRESENT...OVER INDIANA AND OHIO BY 00Z...SUGGESTING THAT THE TWO                
TROUGHS HAVE NOT PHASED YET. NONETHELESS...THE SFC LOW THAT WAS                 
CROSSING INTO ERN LAKE SUPERIOR REDEVELOPS AND STRENGTHENS TO AROUND            
1005MB NEAR DTX AT 00Z. THE TRACK OF THE LOW MEANS AN INCREASING NW             
TO NORTH WIND THROUGH THE DAY...ALLOWING CONTINUED COOLING OF THE               
AIR OVER THE CWA. HOWEVER...850MB TEMPS GENERALLY ONLY DROP TO                  
AROUND -8C ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA. BETTER COOLING...DOWN TO -12 TO               
-14C...STAYS OUT TO THE WEST OVER MN...THOUGH -8C IS SUFFICIENT                 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SOME LAKE EFFECT CLOUDS OR LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. THE            
GREATEST PROBABILITY FOR THAT TO OCCUR WOULD BE IN THE EASTERN CWA              
WHICH WILL STILL BE IN A HEIGHT FALL SCENARIO EAST OF THE UPPER LOW.            
IN FACT...HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO LIKELY IN THIS AREA.                     
ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR TWO SHOULD BE THE RULE WITH                  
SOUNDINGS SUGGESTING WET SNOW. SOME OF THE SNOW AGAIN COULD MIX WITH            
RAIN OVER THE WATER AND EVEN ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR                    
SHORELINE...WITH THE INCREASING WIND PRODUCING MORE HEAT FLUX. GIVEN            
THE COLD ADVECTION AND PLENTY OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER               
LOW AND OFF LAKE SUPERIOR...TEMPS MAY STRUGGLE TO RISE MUCH...MAYBE             
ABOUT 10 DEGREES. WARMEST AREAS EXPECTED IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL WITH              
NW WINDS DOWNSLOPING AND ALONG THE EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR SHORELINE.             
MON NIGHT INTO TUE...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER              
LOW QUICKLY TO THE SE...REACHING LAKE ERIE BY 12Z TUE AND THEN TO               
NEW YORK STATE BY 00Z WED. THIS MEANS GRADUAL HEIGHT RISES ALOFT                
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH IS NOTED BY RH FIELDS SHOWING DRY                    
ADVECTION ALOFT AS SUBSIDENCE INCREASES. HOWEVER...MOIST COOL LOW               
LEVEL AIR BEING DRIVEN SOUTH MON NIGHT WILL MEAN A FAVORABLE LAKE               
ENHANCED/UPSLOPE SETUP. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY IN THE FAVORED            
NORTHERLY FLOW AREAS...IN ADDITION TO THE SE U.P. SINCE THE WINDS               
ARE PROGGED TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DRIVE ENHANCED BANDS INLAND. PCPN            
SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW...THOUGH POSSIBLY MIXED WITH RAIN IN              
THE EVENING NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR UNTIL ENOUGH COOLING CAN TAKE PLACE              
TO SWITCH IT ALL TO SNOW. GREATEST AMOUNT OF PCPN EXPECTED IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL U.P....BUT LOW SNOW TO WATER                 
RATIOS (10 TO 1 OR POSSIBLY EVEN LESS) SUGGESTS ONLY AN INCH OR TWO             
OF ACCUMULATION. PCPN SHOULD DIMINISH WEST TO EAST SOMEWHAT THROUGH             
THE DAY ON TUE...ENOUGH THAT POPS REMAIN IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY...              
THOUGH STILL HIGH IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF MQT/ALGER COUNTIES.                   
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM MAY DRY OUT ENOUGH...                  
PARTICULARLY FROM THE NAM...THAT THE SNOW COULD CHANGE TO DZ IN THE             
AFTN. DAY SHIFT WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN TO SEE IF MODELS                
TREND TOWARDS THIS IDEA. TEMPERATURE WISE...READINGS SHOULD NOT GET             
TOO CHILLY MON NIGHT THANKS TO CLOUDS AND WIND. MOST LOCATIONS                  
SHOULD FALL INTO THE 20S...AND THOSE NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR MAY ONLY                
BOTTOM OUT AT 30. THE CLIMB ON TUE EXPECTED AGAIN OF 5 TO 10                    
DEGREES...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING.

PROFILES SHOW CONTINUED DRY ADVECTION ALOFT AND LOWERING                        
INVERSIONS...WHICH RESULTS IN TRAPPED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DURING THIS            
PERIOD. AT THE SFC...THE AREA IS STUCK BETWEEN A RIDGE BUILDING IN              
FROM MN AND A LOW IN EASTERN ONTARIO ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER                  
LOW...RESULTING IN CONTINUED NORTH TO NW WINDS OVER THE CWA. WITH               
THE LOW CLOUDS AND THE WIND DIRECTION...ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT                
900MB TEMPS AROUND -8C ARE FAVORABLE FOR LAKE ENHANCEMENT...SOME                
LIGHT PCPN IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN UPSLOPE AREAS. SOUNDINGS                 
SUGGEST THAT THE -10C ISOTHERM WILL DRY OUT...WHICH MEANS EITHER                
FZDZ OR -SHSN ARE POSSIBLE. HAVE INCLUDED THE FZDZ NOW ONLY IN                  
UPSLOPE AREAS WHERE THE GREATER PROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING EXISTS.             
FUTURE SHIFTS WILL NEED TO SEE IF FZDZ IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE. THE                 
CHANCES FOR -SHSN/FZDZ ARE CONFINED TO TUE NIGHT THROUGH WED                    
MORNING. AFTER WED MORNING...IT APPEARS THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH                  
DRYING BOTH BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ALOFT TO END THE NEED FOR CHANCE               
POPS. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW...WITH SUGGESTIONS BY             
THE ECMWF OF IT ROTATING BACK FARTHER WEST FOR THE NEED TO INCLUDE              
POPS FOR THE EASTERN CWA. TEMPS TUE NIGHT EXPECTED TO BE A FEW                  
DEGREES COOLER THAN MON NIGHT...COLDEST IN FAR WRN UPPER MI CLOSER              
TO THE SFC RIDGE. HIGHS ON WED SHOULD BE CLOSE TO NORMAL.                       
BEYOND WED...NO CHANGES MADE. LOOKS LIKE IN THE MEAN FROM THE 00Z               
ECMWF/GFS/GFS ENSEMBLES THAT THE CWA WILL REMAIN IN UPPER TROUGH                
THROUGH THE NEXT 7 TO 10 DAYS. OVER TIME...THE TROUGHING GETS                   
COOLER...BUT REALLY NOTHING TOO COLD EVIDENT.

THE E AND THE LOW LEVEL WINDS SHIFTING FROM THE S TO THE WSW LATE IN            
THE NIGHT AND SUNDAY...EXPECT STRATOCU OVER THE NRN PLAINS/MN TO                
GRADUALLY OVERSPREAD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. THE CLOUD BASE WILL                 
INITIALLY BE VFR BUT SHOULD GRADUALLY TREND TOWARD MVFR IN THE

SWRLY WINDS ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR IN THE 15-25KT RANGE WITH GUSTS TO             
30KT. AS THE LOW SETTLES SE TOWARD THE LOWER LAKES...REORGANIZES AND

AFTN THRU TUE WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF OF THE LAKE.             
IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS COULD                   
OCCUR...BUT SINCE COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK...WILL HOLD OFF ON A

PLAINS AND INTO WRN MN. 12Z BIS SDNG SHOWS QUITE A BIT OF LLVL MSTR             
BLO INVRN BASE AT H825. BUT SINCE AIRMASS IS DRY ABV H8 THERE...NO              
PCPN IS NOTED UNDER THE CLD COVER EVEN THOUGH THERE IS SOME FOG. THE            
TEMP OF THE MOIST LYR AT BIS WAS ENTIRELY ABV -10C. ANOTHER SHRTWV              
WAS NOTED OVER NRN MANITOBA AND DIGGING INTO NW ONTARIO E OF THE UPR            
RDG AXIS IN THE PLAINS. COVG OF DEEPER CLD COVER/PCPN ACCOMPANYING

FALLS OVER SCNTRL CAN. WITH LLVL FLOW VEERING FM S LATE TODAY TO THE            
WSW BY SUN MRNG...THE CLDS NOW OVER THE DAKOTAS/WRN MN ARE LIKELY TO            
ADVECT INTO THE UPR GRT LKS LATER TNGT AS INDICATED BY FCST RH SHOWN            
ON THE F18-24 GFS/NAM 280-285K ISENTROPIC SFCS (H9 THRU H775).

DIMINISH DESPITE INCRS IN SPECIFIC HUMIDITY SHOWN ON THE ISENTROPIC

.LONG TERM DISCUSSION...(SUN NIGHT THRU THURS)                                  
LOW PRESSURE DROPPING SOUTHEAST FROM NORTHERN MANITOBA WILL BRING               
SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO THE FA STARTING LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. BEST              
MOISTURE THOUGH REMAINS SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FA...TIED TO A LEE                
TROUGH THAT LATER BECOMES ABSORBED BY THE MANITOBA LOW. WILL NEED TO            
KEEP AN EYE ON THIS THOUGH AS LATEST GFS GUIDANCE HAS SHIFTED                   
OVERALL MOISTURE FIELDS FURTHER NORTH AND WEST WHICH WOULD BE MORE              
IN LINE WITH THE 12Z/00Z ECMWF. CURRENT FCST HAS HIGH END CHANCE                
POPS OVER SOUTHEASTERN CWA WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS ACROSS THE                  
CENTRAL ZONES. AS THIS SYNOPTIC SNOW IS GOING ON...LIGHT LAKE EFFECT            
SNOW SHOWERS WILL BEGIN FOR NORTHWEST LAKE SUPERIOR LES BELTS ACROSS            
THE WEST AS THE LOW SHIFTS TO LAKE ERIE MONDAY AFTERNOON. AS WINDS              
TURN NORTH...SHIFTED HIGHEST POPS OVER NORTH CENTRAL UPPER MICHIGAN             
AND INTO WESTERN GOGEBIC COUNTY. OVERALL AIRMASS BEHIND THE LOW                 
ISN/T VERY COLD...THOUGH QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR LES PROCESSES TO                  
BEGIN...850MB TEMPS -10C/LS TEMPS AOB 8C. INVERSION HEIGHTS ARE                 
PROGGED TO BE POOR AS WELL...AOB 3KFT...WHICH ALONG WITH SHALLOW                
MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE WHY WE WON/T BE SEEING MUCH SNOW THIS WEEK.              
AS THE LOW MOVES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES TUESDAY MORNING...IT              
SLOWS AND BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH THURSDAY. AS A                      
RESULT...LINGERED LES INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. FUTURE SHIFTS               
MAY NEED TO LINGER LES LONGER ACROSS EASTERN ZONES...THOUGH RIGHT               
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS NORTHERLY FLOW WILL JUST TRANSLATE INTO                  
STRATUS. A BRIEF INFLUX OF MOISTURE ON THURSDAY MORNING ACROSS THE              
WESTERN ZONES...AS SEEN ON THE 295K SFC...MAY WARRANT THE ADDITION              
OF SOME LES POPS...KEPT FCST DRY FOR NOW THOUGH.

.AVIATION (FOR THE 06Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AT BOTH SITES AS DRY AIRMASS LINGERS            
EVEN AS THE SFC RIDGE SLIDES TO THE EAST. WITH THE RIDGE SHIFTING TO            
THE E AND THE LOW LEVEL WINDS SHIFTING FROM THE S TO THE WSW LATE IN            
THE NIGHT AND SUNDAY...EXPECT STRATOCU OVER THE NRN PLAINS/MN TO                
GRADUALLY OVERSPREAD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. THE CLOUD BASE WILL                 
INITIALLY BE VFR BUT SHOULD GRADUALLY TREND TOWARD MVFR IN THE MORNING          
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF GREATER MOISTURE BELOW THE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION.            
LIGHT SNOW THAY MAY REDUCE VSBY IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AFTER 06Z/MON

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 PM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
LOOK FOR A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE GREAT LAKES TODAY TO MOVE               
EASTWARD AND WEAKEN THROUGH SUNDAY.  FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND...A LOW             
WILL MOVE INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES FROM NORTHERN MANITOBA AND                 
PRESS INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES BY EARLY TUESDAY. NORTH WINDS IN             
THE WAKE OF THIS LOW MAY REACH 30 KNOTS. EXPECT THE LOW TO THEN                 
SLOWLY SHIFT NORTHEAST...REACHING THE EAST END OF LAKE ONTARIO BY               
LATE WEDNESDAY. ALSO ON WEDNESDAY...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE FROM THE

.LONG TERM DISCUSSION...(SUN NIGHT THRU THURS)                                  
LOW PRESSURE DROPPING SOUTHEAST FROM NORTHERN MANITOBA WILL BRING               
SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO THE FA STARTING LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. BEST              
MOISTURE THOUGH REMAINS SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FA...TIED TO A LEE                
TROUGH THAT LATER BECOMES ABSORBED BY THE MANITOBA LOW. WILL NEED TO            
KEEP AN EYE ON THIS THOUGH AS LATEST GFS GUIDANCE HAS SHIFTED                   
OVERALL MOISTURE FIELDS FURTHER NORTH AND WEST WHICH WOULD BE MORE              
IN LINE WITH THE 12Z/00Z ECMWF. CURRENT FCST HAS HIGH END CHANCE                
POPS OVER SOUTHEASTERN CWA WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS ACROSS THE                  
CENTRAL ZONES. AS THIS SYNOPTIC SNOW IS GOING ON...LIGHT LAKE EFFECT            
SNOW SHOWERS WILL BEGIN FOR NORTHWEST LAKE SUPERIOR LES BELTS ACROSS            
THE WEST AS THE LOW SHIFTS TO LAKE ERIE MONDAY AFTERNOON. AS WINDS              
TURN NORTH...SHIFTED HIGHEST POPS OVER NORTH CENTRAL UPPER MICHIGAN             
AND INTO WESTERN GOGEBIC COUNTY. OVERALL AIRMASS BEHIND THE LOW                 
ISN/T VERY COLD...THOUGH QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR LES PROCESSES TO                  
BEGIN...850MB TEMPS -10C/LS TEMPS AOB 8C. INVERSION HEIGHTS ARE                 
PROGGED TO BE POOR AS WELL...AOB 3KFT...WHICH ALONG WITH SHALLOW                
MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE WHY WE WON/T BE SEEING MUCH SNOW THIS WEEK.              
AS THE LOW MOVES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES TUESDAY MORNING...IT              
SLOWS AND BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH THURSDAY. AS A                      
RESULT...LINGERED LES INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. FUTURE SHIFTS               
MAY NEED TO LINGER LES LONGER ACROSS EASTERN ZONES...THOUGH RIGHT               
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS NORTHERLY FLOW WILL JUST TRANSLATE INTO                  
STRATUS. A BRIEF INFLUX OF MOISTURE ON THURSDAY MORNING ACROSS THE              
WESTERN ZONES...AS SEEN ON THE 295K SFC...MAY WARRANT THE ADDITION              
OF SOME LES POPS...KEPT FCST DRY FOR NOW THOUGH.

.AVIATION (FOR THE 00Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS TONIGHT AT BOTH SITES WITH SFC RDG AND DRY                
AIRMASS DOMINATING THE REGION. AS THE RIDGE SHIFTS TO THE E AND THE             
LOW LEVEL WINDS SHIFT FROM THE S TO THE WSW LATE TONIGHT AND                    
SUNDAY...EXPECT SC OVER THE NRN PLAINS/MN TO GRADUALLY OVERSPREAD               
THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. THE CLOUD BASE WILL INITIALLY BE VFR BUT                 
SHOULD GRADUALLY TREND TOWARD MVFR SUN MORNING WITH THE ARRIVAL OF              
GREATER MOISTURE BELOW THE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 PM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
LOOK FOR A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE GREAT LAKES TODAY TO MOVE               
EASTWARD AND WEAKEN THROUGH SUNDAY.  FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND...A LOW             
WILL MOVE INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES FROM NORTHERN MANITOBA AND                 
PRESS INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES BY EARLY TUESDAY. NORTH WINDS IN             
THE WAKE OF THIS LOW MAY REACH 30 KNOTS. EXPECT THE LOW TO THEN                 
SLOWLY SHIFT NORTHEAST...REACHING THE EAST END OF LAKE ONTARIO BY               
LATE WEDNESDAY. ALSO ON WEDNESDAY...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE FROM THE

OVERALL MOISTURE FIELDS FURTHER NORTH AND WEST WHICH WOULD BE MORE

POPS OVER SOUTHEASTERN CWA WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS ACROSS THE

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A DEEP TROF EXTENDING S               
INTO NEW ENGLAND AND THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. RIDGE IS TO THE LEE OF            
THE ROCKIES AND EXTENDS WELL N TO THE NW TERRITORIES. A WELL-DEFINED            
SHORTWAVE HAS CUT THRU THE RIDGE AND IS NOW OVER ERN SD. IT`S ON A              
TRACK TO PASS S OF UPPER MI AND HAVE NO AFFECT ON THE WEATHER HERE.             
FARTHER UPSTREAM...TROF HAS MOVED ONSHORE IN WRN CANADA WITH STRONG             
SHORTWAVE IMPACTING WA/BRITISH COLUMBIA (12HR HEIGHT FALLS WERE                 
UPWARDS OF 140M AT 500MB). THIS TROF WILL BE THE NEXT SYSTEM TO                 
AFFECT THE AREA AS IT DROPS INTO THE GREAT LAKES SUN/MON. CLOSER                
TO HOME...LES CONTINUES OFF LAKE SUPERIOR...BUT HAS WEAKENED                    
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FEW HRS. STRENGTHENING LAND BREEZES ARE               
FOCUSING MAIN BANDS OF -SHSN INTO MAINLY ALGER COUNTY. OTHERWISE...             
-SHSN/FLURRIES LINGER FROM THE KEWEENAW TO ERN UPPER MI. OVER SW                
UPPER MI...SKIES CLEARED EARLIER IN THE NIGHT AND TEMPS HAVE                    
NOSE-DIVED UNDER CLEAR SKIES/CALM WIND/FRESH SNOW COVER. AS OF                  
09Z...LOWEST TEMP IS -15F AT THE WAKEFIELD RAWS SITE.                           
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... (ISSUED AT 5 AM EST)                                             
WITH SFC RIDGE AXIS ACROSS CNTRL LAKE SUPERIOR AND CNTRL UPPER MI               
DRIFTING E...ONGOING LES WILL SHIFT OFFSHORE BY MID MORNING UNDER               
DEVELOPING SRLY FLOW ENHANCED BY LAND BREEZE. OTHERWISE...AREAS THAT            
START THE DAY MOSTLY SUNNY SHOULD GENERALLY REMAIN THAT WAY WHILE               
AREAS WITH STRATOCU SHOULD TREND MOSTLY SUNNY BY AFTN. ONLY                     
EXCEPTION WILL BE DOWNWIND OF LAKE MICHIGAN (SRN SCHOOLCRAFT/LUCE               
COUNTIES) WHERE DEVELOPING SRLY FLOW SHOULD BRING STRATOCU AND SOME             
FLURRIES DURING THE AFTN. THERE WILL BE SOME CI SPILLING DOWN THE               
FRONT SIDE OF MID/UPPER RIDGE TO THE W...BUT AT THE MOMENT IT DOES              
NOT APPEAR THAT THE CI WILL BE TOO THICK OR WIDESPREAD. FAVORED THE             
LOWER END OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS BASED ON UPSTREAM HIGHS                
YESTERDAY.                                                                      
NAM/GFS ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON DEVELOPING WAA PATTERN                   
TONIGHT/SUN AHEAD OF TROF EMERGING TO THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. WITH              
TIGHTER THERMAL GRADIENT TO THE N IN ONTARIO...BEST ISENTROPIC                  
ASCENT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL OF MEASURABLE PCPN WILL                 
REMAIN N OF THE FCST AREA AS WELL. INHERITED FCST HAD A MENTION OF              
-FZDZ LATE TONIGHT/SUN MORNING OVER ROUGHLY THE W HALF OF THE FCST              
AREA WITH EXCEPTION OF AREAS WHERE SWRLY FLOW DOWNSLOPES...                     
MINIMIZING THREAT. NAM FCST SOUNDINGS STILL LEND SUPPORT TO THIS                
POSSIBILITY AS TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE -10C IN DEVELOPING LOW-LEVEL                 
SATURATION...AND THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF UPWARD MOTION STILL                  
OCCURRING AFTER SATURATION IS ACHIEVED. LOCAL REG-WRF RUN PROVIDES              
SOME SUPPORT...BUT GFS IS LESS SUPPORTIVE OF THE POTENTIAL OF -FZDZ.            
AT THIS POINT...SEE NO REASON TO PULL THE MENTION OF PATCHY                     
-FZDZ...BUT WILL PUSH BACK TIMING TO LATE TONIGHT DUE TO SLOWER                 
ARRIVAL OF MOISTURE. ONLY OTHER MINOR ISSUE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A             
LITTLE SW FLOW LAKE ENHANCED SNOW OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR AND NRN                
LAKE MICHIGAN AS 850MB TEMPS ARE SUFFICIENTLY LOW ENOUGH. OVER LAKE             
SUPERIOR...WINDS IN THE CLOUD LAYER MAY HAVE ENOUGH OF A WRLY                   
COMPONENT THAT IF SHSN DEVELOP...THEY MAY BRUSH THE KEWEENAW LATE               
TONIGHT/SUN. WILL ONLY UTILIZE SLIGHT CHC POPS DUE TO                           
UNCERTAINTY IN WIND DIRECTION...AND ALSO BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT MAY                
ONLY OCCUR N OF THE KEWEENAW WHERE FETCH IS MAXIMIZED. OVER NRN LAKE            
MICHIGAN...IT APPEARS BY THE TIME ANY DEVELOPMENT OCCURS...WINDS                
WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF A WRLY COMPONENT TO KEEP ANY -SHSN E OF                     
SCHOOLCRAFT/LUCE COUNTIES. MINOR HEIGHT FALLS BEGIN SUN AFTN AS TROF            
EDGES E ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND SCNTRL CANADA. HOWEVER...HAVE A            
HARD TIME FINDING ANY FORCING SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT A MENTION OF                
PCPN. SO...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE KEWEENAW...EXPECT A DRY AFTN               
ACROSS THE FCST AREA.                                                           
BETTER HEIGHT FALLS DEVELOP SUN NIGHT INTO MON AS TROF REACHES THE              
GREAT LAKES WITH MID LEVEL LOW SETTLING SE INTO THE UPPER LAKES BY              
MON EVENING. AS BROAD SFC LOW BEGINS TO ORGANIZE OVER THE UPPER                 
LAKES...NWRLY FLOW AND CAA WILL BEGIN SUN NIGHT. GFS IS QUICKEST                
WITH THE COOLING...DROPPING 850MB TEMPS TO -9/-10C OVER THE W HALF              
OF LAKE SUPERIOR BY 12Z MON WHICH WOULD SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF LES.             
NAM IS CONSIDERABLY WARMER...ONLY AROUND -4C. UKMET/ECMWF/REG-WRF               
FALL BTWN THE NAM/GFS...BUT CLOSER TO THE GFS AND STILL MARGINALLY              
COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LES. SO...WITH LIMITED FORCING...PCPN SUN NIGHT            
MAY BE TIED MOSTLY TO LAKE EFFECT. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHC POPS.                 
PER ECMWF/GFS...AS NW FLOW BECOMES N WITH SFC LOW PRES CONSOLIDATING            
TOWARD THE LOWER LAKES...EXPECT -SHSN TO EXPAND ACROSS NRN UPPER MI             
MON. WITH LIMITED OVERLAKE INSTABILITY (850MB TEMPS AROUND -9C) AND             
WITH MUCH OF THE UPWARD MOTION OCCURRING BELOW THE DENDRITIC SNOW               
GROWTH TEMP ZONE...EXPECT MAINLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW.                   
CONSOLIDATING LOW TO THE SE MAY ALSO SPREAD A GENERAL -SN INTO THE              
ERN FCST AREA MON. -SHSN WILL CONTINUE UNDER NRLY FLOW MON NIGHT                
THEN DIMINISH TUE.

.AVIATION (FOR THE 18Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS THIS AFTN/TNGT AT BOTH SITES WITH DRY AIRMASS             
SHOWN ON THE 12Z GRB RAOB/SFC HI PRES RDG DOMINATING. AS THE RDG                
SHIFTS TO THE E AND THE LLVL WINDS SHIFT FM THE S TO THE WSW LATE               
TNGT/SUN...EXPECT SC OVER THE NRN PLAINS/MN TO GRDLY OVERSPREAD THE             
UPR LKS. THE CLD BASE WL INITIALLY BE VFR GIVEN DRYNESS OF

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL                
MOVE EAST TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY AS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS                
ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA. VARIABLE WINDS UNDER 25 KTS TODAY WILL                  
BECOME SW TONIGHT AS THE LOW APPROACHES...WITH SPEEDS UP TO 30 KT               
POSSIBLE THROUGH SUNDAY. LOOK FOR THE LOW TO DROP SE INTO THE                   
EASTERN GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY WHILE MERGING WITH ANOTHER LOW MOVING             
NE OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY. THE RESULT WILL BE TO SHIFT WINDS TO THE             
WEST AND THEN NW ON MONDAY...STAYING GENERALLY IN THE 15 TO 25 KT               
RANGE. EXPECT WINDS TO SWING AROUND TO THE NORTH AT 30 KT MON NIGHT             
INTO TUE AS THE LOW DEEPENS AND LIFTS INTO NEW ENGLAND. THE                     
STRONGEST WINDS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. THE LOW            
WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE...WHILE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE PLAINS            
TOWARDS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. DUE TO THIS MOVEMENT... NORTHERLY                
WINDS OF 15 TO 25 KT SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE EAST HALF OF SUPERIOR               
FOR TUE NIGHT INTO WED...WHILE WINDS DIMINISH BELOW 20 KT OVER                  
WESTERN SUPERIOR.

UPDATED AVIATION DISCUSSION FOR 12Z TAF ISSUANCE                                
.SYNOPSIS... (ISSUED AT 5 AM EST)                                               
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A DEEP TROF EXTENDING S               
INTO NEW ENGLAND AND THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. RIDGE IS TO THE LEE OF            
THE ROCKIES AND EXTENDS WELL N TO THE NW TERRITORIES. A WELL-DEFINED            
SHORTWAVE HAS CUT THRU THE RIDGE AND IS NOW OVER ERN SD. IT`S ON A              
TRACK TO PASS S OF UPPER MI AND HAVE NO AFFECT ON THE WEATHER HERE.             
FARTHER UPSTREAM...TROF HAS MOVED ONSHORE IN WRN CANADA WITH STRONG             
SHORTWAVE IMPACTING WA/BRITISH COLUMBIA (12HR HEIGHT FALLS WERE                 
UPWARDS OF 140M AT 500MB). THIS TROF WILL BE THE NEXT SYSTEM TO                 
AFFECT THE AREA AS IT DROPS INTO THE GREAT LAKES SUN/MON. CLOSER                
TO HOME...LES CONTINUES OFF LAKE SUPERIOR...BUT HAS WEAKENED                    
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FEW HRS. STRENGTHENING LAND BREEZES ARE               
FOCUSING MAIN BANDS OF -SHSN INTO MAINLY ALGER COUNTY. OTHERWISE...             
-SHSN/FLURRIES LINGER FROM THE KEWEENAW TO ERN UPPER MI. OVER SW                
UPPER MI...SKIES CLEARED EARLIER IN THE NIGHT AND TEMPS HAVE                    
NOSE-DIVED UNDER CLEAR SKIES/CALM WIND/FRESH SNOW COVER. AS OF                  
09Z...LOWEST TEMP IS -15F AT THE WAKEFIELD RAWS SITE.                           
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... (ISSUED AT 5 AM EST)                                             
WITH SFC RIDGE AXIS ACROSS CNTRL LAKE SUPERIOR AND CNTRL UPPER MI               
DRIFTING E...ONGOING LES WILL SHIFT OFFSHORE BY MID MORNING UNDER               
DEVELOPING SRLY FLOW ENHANCED BY LAND BREEZE. OTHERWISE...AREAS THAT            
START THE DAY MOSTLY SUNNY SHOULD GENERALLY REMAIN THAT WAY WHILE               
AREAS WITH STRATOCU SHOULD TREND MOSTLY SUNNY BY AFTN. ONLY                     
EXCEPTION WILL BE DOWNWIND OF LAKE MICHIGAN (SRN SCHOOLCRAFT/LUCE               
COUNTIES) WHERE DEVELOPING SRLY FLOW SHOULD BRING STRATOCU AND SOME             
FLURRIES DURING THE AFTN. THERE WILL BE SOME CI SPILLING DOWN THE               
FRONT SIDE OF MID/UPPER RIDGE TO THE W...BUT AT THE MOMENT IT DOES              
NOT APPEAR THAT THE CI WILL BE TOO THICK OR WIDESPREAD. FAVORED THE             
LOWER END OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS BASED ON UPSTREAM HIGHS                
YESTERDAY.                                                                      
NAM/GFS ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON DEVELOPING WAA PATTERN                   
TONIGHT/SUN AHEAD OF TROF EMERGING TO THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. WITH              
TIGHTER THERMAL GRADIENT TO THE N IN ONTARIO...BEST ISENTROPIC                  
ASCENT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL OF MEASURABLE PCPN WILL                 
REMAIN N OF THE FCST AREA AS WELL. INHERITED FCST HAD A MENTION OF              
-FZDZ LATE TONIGHT/SUN MORNING OVER ROUGHLY THE W HALF OF THE FCST              
AREA WITH EXCEPTION OF AREAS WHERE SWRLY FLOW DOWNSLOPES...                     
MINIMIZING THREAT. NAM FCST SOUNDINGS STILL LEND SUPPORT TO THIS                
POSSIBILITY AS TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE -10C IN DEVELOPING LOW-LEVEL                 
SATURATION...AND THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF UPWARD MOTION STILL                  
OCCURRING AFTER SATURATION IS ACHIEVED. LOCAL REG-WRF RUN PROVIDES              
SOME SUPPORT...BUT GFS IS LESS SUPPORTIVE OF THE POTENTIAL OF -FZDZ.            
AT THIS POINT...SEE NO REASON TO PULL THE MENTION OF PATCHY                     
-FZDZ...BUT WILL PUSH BACK TIMING TO LATE TONIGHT DUE TO SLOWER                 
ARRIVAL OF MOISTURE. ONLY OTHER MINOR ISSUE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A             
LITTLE SW FLOW LAKE ENHANCED SNOW OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR AND NRN                
LAKE MICHIGAN AS 850MB TEMPS ARE SUFFICIENTLY LOW ENOUGH. OVER LAKE             
SUPERIOR...WINDS IN THE CLOUD LAYER MAY HAVE ENOUGH OF A WRLY                   
COMPONENT THAT IF SHSN DEVELOP...THEY MAY BRUSH THE KEWEENAW LATE               
TONIGHT/SUN. WILL ONLY UTILIZE SLIGHT CHC POPS DUE TO                           
UNCERTAINTY IN WIND DIRECTION...AND ALSO BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT MAY                
ONLY OCCUR N OF THE KEWEENAW WHERE FETCH IS MAXIMIZED. OVER NRN LAKE            
MICHIGAN...IT APPEARS BY THE TIME ANY DEVELOPMENT OCCURS...WINDS                
WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF A WRLY COMPONENT TO KEEP ANY -SHSN E OF                     
SCHOOLCRAFT/LUCE COUNTIES. MINOR HEIGHT FALLS BEGIN SUN AFTN AS TROF            
EDGES E ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND SCNTRL CANADA. HOWEVER...HAVE A            
HARD TIME FINDING ANY FORCING SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT A MENTION OF                
PCPN. SO...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE KEWEENAW...EXPECT A DRY AFTN               
ACROSS THE FCST AREA.                                                           
BETTER HEIGHT FALLS DEVELOP SUN NIGHT INTO MON AS TROF REACHES THE              
GREAT LAKES WITH MID LEVEL LOW SETTLING SE INTO THE UPPER LAKES BY              
MON EVENING. AS BROAD SFC LOW BEGINS TO ORGANIZE OVER THE UPPER                 
LAKES...NWRLY FLOW AND CAA WILL BEGIN SUN NIGHT. GFS IS QUICKEST                
WITH THE COOLING...DROPPING 850MB TEMPS TO -9/-10C OVER THE W HALF              
OF LAKE SUPERIOR BY 12Z MON WHICH WOULD SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF LES.             
NAM IS CONSIDERABLY WARMER...ONLY AROUND -4C. UKMET/ECMWF/REG-WRF               
FALL BTWN THE NAM/GFS...BUT CLOSER TO THE GFS AND STILL MARGINALLY              
COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LES. SO...WITH LIMITED FORCING...PCPN SUN NIGHT            
MAY BE TIED MOSTLY TO LAKE EFFECT. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHC POPS.                 
PER ECMWF/GFS...AS NW FLOW BECOMES N WITH SFC LOW PRES CONSOLIDATING            
TOWARD THE LOWER LAKES...EXPECT -SHSN TO EXPAND ACROSS NRN UPPER MI             
MON. WITH LIMITED OVERLAKE INSTABILITY (850MB TEMPS AROUND -9C) AND             
WITH MUCH OF THE UPWARD MOTION OCCURRING BELOW THE DENDRITIC SNOW               
GROWTH TEMP ZONE...EXPECT MAINLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW.                   
CONSOLIDATING LOW TO THE SE MAY ALSO SPREAD A GENERAL -SN INTO THE              
ERN FCST AREA MON. -SHSN WILL CONTINUE UNDER NRLY FLOW MON NIGHT                
THEN DIMINISH TUE.                                                              
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION (FOR THE 12Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
LK EFFECT CONTINUES TO DIMINISH WITH A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER                 
UPPER MICHIGAN AND THE PRESENCE OF DRY AIR. VSBYS ARE NOW VFR AT                
BOTH SITES AND WILL STAY THAT WAY THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. CIGS             
ARE ANOTHER ISSUE. MVFR LAKE EFFECT CLOUDS PERSIST AT BOTH SITES                
WITH NW WINDS. AS THE WINDS TURN SW THIS MORNING...THE CLOUDS SHOULD            
EXIT BOTH TAF SITES BY EARLY AFTERNOON. TONIGHT...A SURGE OF WARM               
AIR WILL HELP SPREAD A VFR STRATUS DECK INTO UPPER MI. THERE ARE                
SOME HINTS THAT IT COULD LOWER TO MVFR AT CMX LATE...BUT GIVEN ITS              
LATE TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY...HAVE DECLINED TO MENTION THE LOWER                
CIGS. ANY LOWERING TO MVFR MORE LIKELY AFTER 12Z SUNDAY.                        
&&                                                                              
.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL                
MOVE EAST TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY AS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS                
ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA. VARIABLE WINDS UNDER 25 KTS TODAY WILL                  
BECOME SW TONIGHT AS THE LOW APPROACHES...WITH SPEEDS UP TO 30 KT               
POSSIBLE THROUGH SUNDAY. LOOK FOR THE LOW TO DROP SE INTO THE                   
EASTERN GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY WHILE MERGING WITH ANOTHER LOW MOVING             
NE OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY. THE RESULT WILL BE TO SHIFT WINDS TO THE             
WEST AND THEN NW ON MONDAY...STAYING GENERALLY IN THE 15 TO 25 KT               
RANGE. EXPECT WINDS TO SWING AROUND TO THE NORTH AT 30 KT MON NIGHT             
INTO TUE AS THE LOW DEEPENS AND LIFTS INTO NEW ENGLAND. THE                     
STRONGEST WINDS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. THE LOW            
WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE...WHILE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE PLAINS            
TOWARDS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. DUE TO THIS MOVEMENT... NORTHERLY                
WINDS OF 15 TO 25 KT SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE EAST HALF OF SUPERIOR               
FOR TUE NIGHT INTO WED...WHILE WINDS DIMINISH BELOW 20 KT OVER                  
WESTERN SUPERIOR.

MICHIGAN...IT APPEARS BY THE TIME ANY DEVELOPMENT OCCURS...WINDS                
WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF A WRLY COMPONENT TO KEEP ANY -SHSN E OF                     
SCHOOLCRAFT/LUCE COUNTIES. MINOR HEIGHT FALLS BEGIN SUN AFTN AS TROF            
EDGES E ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND SCNTRL CANADA. HOWEVER...HAVE A            
HARD TIME FINDING ANY FORCING SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT A MENTION OF                
PCPN. SO...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE KEWEENAW...EXPECT A DRY AFTN               
ACROSS THE FCST AREA.                                                           
BETTER HEIGHT FALLS DEVELOP SUN NIGHT INTO MON AS TROF REACHES THE              
GREAT LAKES WITH MID LEVEL LOW SETTLING SE INTO THE UPPER LAKES BY              
MON EVENING. AS BROAD SFC LOW BEGINS TO ORGANIZE OVER THE UPPER                 
LAKES...NWRLY FLOW AND CAA WILL BEGIN SUN NIGHT. GFS IS QUICKEST                
WITH THE COOLING...DROPPING 850MB TEMPS TO -9/-10C OVER THE W HALF              
OF LAKE SUPERIOR BY 12Z MON WHICH WOULD SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF LES.             
NAM IS CONSIDERABLY WARMER...ONLY AROUND -4C. UKMET/ECMWF/REG-WRF               
FALL BTWN THE NAM/GFS...BUT CLOSER TO THE GFS AND STILL MARGINALLY              
COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LES. SO...WITH LIMITED FORCING...PCPN SUN NIGHT            
MAY BE TIED MOSTLY TO LAKE EFFECT. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHC POPS.                 
PER ECMWF/GFS...AS NW FLOW BECOMES N WITH SFC LOW PRES CONSOLIDATING            
TOWARD THE LOWER LAKES...EXPECT -SHSN TO EXPAND ACROSS NRN UPPER MI             
MON. WITH LIMITED OVERLAKE INSTABILITY (850MB TEMPS AROUND -9C) AND             
WITH MUCH OF THE UPWARD MOTION OCCURRING BELOW THE DENDRITIC SNOW               
GROWTH TEMP ZONE...EXPECT MAINLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW.                   
CONSOLIDATING LOW TO THE SE MAY ALSO SPREAD A GENERAL -SN INTO THE              
ERN FCST AREA MON. -SHSN WILL CONTINUE UNDER NRLY FLOW MON NIGHT

LK EFFECT DIMINISHES AT CMX THROUGH THE NIGHT AS WINDS BECOME SRLY              
WITH ARRIVAL OF HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE. EXPECT MVFR CIGS AND OCCASIONAL

FLURRIES AT SAW UNTIL LATE TONIGHT BUT CLEARING SKIES TAKE OVR AFTER

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL                
MOVE EAST TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY AS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS                
ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA. VARIABLE WINDS UNDER 25 KTS TODAY WILL                  
BECOME SW TONIGHT AS THE LOW APPROACHES...WITH SPEEDS UP TO 30 KT               
POSSIBLE THROUGH SUNDAY. LOOK FOR THE LOW TO DROP SE INTO THE                   
EASTERN GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY WHILE MERGING WITH ANOTHER LOW MOVING             
NE OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY. THE RESULT WILL BE TO SHIFT WINDS TO THE             
WEST AND THEN NW ON MONDAY...STAYING GENERALLY IN THE 15 TO 25 KT               
RANGE. EXPECT WINDS TO SWING AROUND TO THE NORTH AT 30 KT MON NIGHT             
INTO TUE AS THE LOW DEEPENS AND LIFTS INTO NEW ENGLAND. THE                     
STRONGEST WINDS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. THE LOW            
WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE...WHILE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE PLAINS            
TOWARDS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. DUE TO THIS MOVEMENT... NORTHERLY                
WINDS OF 15 TO 25 KT SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE EAST HALF OF SUPERIOR               
FOR TUE NIGHT INTO WED...WHILE WINDS DIMINISH BELOW 20 KT OVER

.UPDATE... (ISSUED AT 1015 PM EST FRI NOV 21)                                   
BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET A GOOD HANDLE ON THE LK EFFECT THIS EVENING.              
BASED ON RADAR IMGRY...LOCALIZED BANDS ARE QUITE STRONG...LIKELY                
PRODUCING OVR AN INCH PER HOUR SNOW RATES...AS STRONG OVERWATER                 
INSTABILITY COMBINES WITH WEAKENING GRADIENT WINDS AS HIGH PRESSURE             
APPROACHES. RESULT IS NW WINDS ON ERN LK SUPERIOR CONVERGING WITH               
LAND BREEZES OFF BOTH UPR MI AND ONTARIO...LEADING TO SHARP                     
CONVERGENCE. PRIMARY BAND DUMPED A QUICK 5 TO 9 INCHES OF SNOW OUT              
AT SAULT STE MARIE THIS EVENING BUT BASED ON SPOTTER REPORT ALONG LK            
SUPERIOR IN FAR NRN LUCE COUNTY AND THE OBSERVATION AT ERY IT                   
APPEARS NOT MUCH IS HAPPENING IN LUCE COUNTY. MEANWHILE                         
...CONVERGENCE BAND HAS IMPACTED FAR NRN MQT COUNTY FROM HALFWAY                
VILLAGE NORTH TO BIG BAY AND SE INTO MAINLY NW ALGER COUNTY THIS                
EVENING. DESPITE RADAR SHOWING PERSISTENT BANDING IN THESE                      
AREAS...AVILABLE WEB CAMERAS DO NOT INDICATE MUCH IN WAY OF VERY BAD            
VSBY OR HEAVY SNOW. OVR FAR WRN UPR MI...CLEARING SKIES HAVE ALLOWED            
TEMPS TO PLUMMET TO AT OR BLO ZERO ALREADY THIS EVENING IN GOGEBIC              
COUNTY. MADE EARLIER ADJUSTMENT TO LOWER TEMPS FROM ROUGHLY 5 TO 10             
BELOW ZERO IN THE INTERIOR SW WHERE CLEAR SKIES RULE THROUGH THE                
NIGHT. BASED ON LAST NIGHTS OBS BENEATH THE RIDGE IN MANITOBA AND               
FACT THAT PWAT MINIMUM MOVING ACROSS ONLY ENHANCES RADIATIONAL                  
COOLING AND FRESH SNOW PACK...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE MINS AS             
LOW AS 15 BLO IN FAVORED COLD SPOTS IN GOGEBIC/SOUTHERN ONTONAGON/NW            
IRON COUNTY.                                                                    
FOLLOWING THE RUC13 MODEL FOR THE UPDATE AS ITS 18Z/00Z RUNS HAD                
GOOD HANDLE ON THE INCREASINGLY MESOSCALE DOMINANTED LOW LEVEL WIND             
FIELD. RUC13 INDICATES CONVERGENCE AREA NEAR SSM AND JUST TO THE                
NORTH SINKS INTO NRN LUCE COUNTY THROUGH 06Z AND THEN MERGES WITH               
THE ONGOING CONVERGENCE AREA OVR ALGER INTO NRN SCHOOLCRAFT THROUGH             
12Z. ADDITIONAL SNOW AMOUNTS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT IN THE                   
HIGHEST CONVERGENCE AREA WILL LIKELY BE UP TO AN INCH PER HOUR.                 
WARNING FOR THESE TWO ZONES RUNS THROUGH 12Z SATURDAY...WHICH SEEMS             
FINE. THOUGHT LUCE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING OUT TOO WITH THE POTENTIAL             
FOR LOCALLY HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS TO SHIFT THROUGH TIL SHORTLY AFTER               
MIDNIGHT...SO HAVE ISSUED A LK EFFECT SNOW ADVY FOR THE REST OF THE             
NIGHT THERE. INCREASING LAND BREEZE EVENTUALLY PUSHES STRONGER SNOW             
SHOWERS OUT OF THE BIG BAY AREA IN MARQUETTE COUNTY AFTER MIDNIGHT.             
LOW CLOUDS SHOULD LINGER THOUGH AS 925MB-900MB WINDS VEER NRLY WITH             
THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA BUILDING ACROSS NRN LK SUPERIOR. GOING FCST              
HAD THIS HANDLED WELL.

AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL WAA PATTERN DEVELOPING ACROSS THE WRN                
GREAT LAKES. 280K-290K ISENTROPIC LIFT (900-750 MB) MAY PROVIDE                 
ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTENING...PER MDL RH FOR POTENTIAL OF SOME                  
PATCHY -FZDZ OVER THE WEST HALF OF THE CWA BTWN 06Z-18Z/SUN AS THE

SHRTWV TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO DROP SE FROM MANITOBA THROUGH THE GREAT            
LAKES. FALLING HEIGHTS AND MODERATE QG FORCING WITH THE MID LEVEL               
LOW WILL SUPPORT LIGHT SNOW CHANCES ACROSS THE AREA SUN NIGHT INTO              
EARLY MON. BEHIND THE LOW...SOME LAKE ENHANCED SNOW MAY BE POSSIBLE             
WITH CYCLONIC NRLY FLOW DEVELOPING AND 850 MB TEMPS DROPPING TO                 
AROUND -8C. WITH ONLY MARGINAL INSTABILITY/LIFT FCST...MAINLY LIGHT             
ACCUMULATIONS WOULD BE EXPECTED.                                                
TUESDAY...AS THE DEEPER MOISTURE DEPARTS AND 850 MB TEMPS ONLY                  
REMAIN NEAR -10C...PER ECMWF/GFS BLEND...ANY LES SHOULD REMAIN ON

WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY...MID LEVEL AND SFC RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE WRN                
LAKES BRINGING MAINLY DRY WEATHER. UNCERTAINTY BY THE END OF THE                
WEEK INCREASES WITH THE PATH/SPEED OF ANOTHER MID LEVEL LOW DROPPING            
SSE TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES. FOR NOW...THE GLOBAL MDLS AND GFS

WINDOW OF IFR POSSIBLE. WINDS WILL SLOWLY PICK UP TONIGHT... THEN               
PICK UP IN EARNEST ON MONDAY AS THE MAIN COLD FRONT DROPS SOUTH

IMPRESSIVE SHORTWAVE WHICH CAN CURRENTLY BE SEEN DIVING SOUTHEAST

CHANNEL IMAGERY SHOWS FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN IN PLACE AT THE                
CURRENT TIME BUT IT IS STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF AMPLIFYING. WEAK               
UPPER RIDGE HAS PASSED OVERHEAD WITH TROUGHING MOVING IN ON ITS                 
HEELS. MAIN UPPER LOW CIRCULATION IS SAGGING SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS              
LAKES WINNIPEG AND MANITOBA WITH TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING                          
SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. A VORTICITY MAXIMA IS              
QUICKLY MOVING EAST-NORTHEAST TOWARDS CENTRAL MN AND NORTHERN WI                
THIS AFTERNOON EXHIBITED BY NARROW CHANNEL OF SHARP DRYING WORKING              
ALONG THE ND/SD BORDER. SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS WELL ORGANIZED SFC LOW               
OVER NORTHERN MANITOBA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE CLOSED UPPER LOW.                
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS TO ITS SOUTHEAST ACROSS                           
WESTERN/CENTRAL ONTARIO. A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS SOUTHWARD              
ALONG THE MN/DAKOTAS BORDER AND MEETS UP WITH A WEAK SFC LOW ACROSS             
EASTERN NEBRASKA.                                                               
SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA AT 21Z WILL CONTINUE              
EAST-NORTHEAST THIS EVENING. UPPER JET ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSED               
LOW OVER MANITOBA APPEARS TO BE FURTHER WEST THAN EARLIER FORECASTS             
/AS IS THE LOW ITSELF/ RESULTING IN A DECREASED AFFECT FROM THE LEFT            
EXIT REGION. UPPER JET CURRENTLY INCREASING ACROSS IOWA SHOULD                  
PROVIDE A BRIEF WINDOW OF LEFT FRONT QUAD ASCENT EARLY THIS EVENING             
BEFORE THAT SHIFTS TO THE EAST. NONETHELESS FORCING FOR ASCENT IS               
EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH ENCOUNTERS THE SFC                 
INVERTED TROUGH. CURRENT RADAR MOSAIC SHOWS BANDS OF MID LEVEL                  
RETURNS WITH LITTLE SHOWING UP IN SFC OBS DUE TO LOW LEVEL DRY AIR              
THAT IS STILL BEING OVERCOME. THIS WILL BE THE CHALLENGE THROUGH THE            
EVENING AS DECENT FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING IN THE H7-H6 LAYER SAGS               
SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA. MUCH OF THE FORCING WILL GO TOWARDS               
SATURATION EARLY ON...WITH A LARGE DRY WEDGE STILL SHOWING UP ON                
RECENT AIRCRAFT SOUNDINGS FROM KMSP. DO EXPECT SNOW TO FALL TO THE              
SURFACE DURING THE EARLY EVENING ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL CWA BEFORE            
SHIFTING SOUTHEAST. DUE TO THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM DURATION OF SNOW             
WILL BE SHORT LIVED...PROBABLY JUST A COUPLE HOURS...WHICH WILL                 
LIMIT AMOUNTS. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE FORCING BRIEF PERIODS OF                 
MODERATE SNOW ARE EXPECTED AND A QUICK COUPLE TENTHS MAY BE                     
RECEIVED. GENERALLY ABOUT A HALF INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM NEW ULM             
TO THE TWIN CITIES TO RICE LAKE AND POINTS SOUTHEAST. SOME ISOLATED             
LOCATIONS MAY SEE AROUND AN INCH. AREAS ALONG THE IA BORDER MAY SEE             
LITTLE PRECIP WITH DRY AIR MOVING IN ALOFT AS SEEN ON LATEST WATER              
VAPOR IMAGERY. A BRIEF WINDOW OF RAIN/SNOW MIX MAY OCCUR BETWEEN                
NOW AND 01Z OR SO WITH WARM LOW LEVEL TEMPS BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS              
SHOW WET BULB TEMPS TO BE BELOW ZERO THROUGH THE COLUMN ALLOWING                
EVAPORATIVE COOLING DURING THE TOP DOWN SATURATION TO YIELD JUST                
ABOUT ALL SNOW AT ONSET. THE WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE TO THE SOUTHEAST            
SO MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL END BY MIDNIGHT. SKIES MAY EVEN SCATTER              
OUT FOR A PERIOD PRIOR TO DAYBREAK AS SUBSIDENCE FILLS IN BEHIND THE            
WAVE.                                                                           
THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL/NORTHERN MANITOBA WILL CONTINUE            
TO DROP SOUTHEASTWARD ENTERING THE ARROWHEAD BY MIDDAY. CYCLONIC                
VORTICITY ADVECTION WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF ATTENDANT VORT MAX WHICH             
SWINGS FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN                      
TWO-THIRDS OR SO OF THE AREA. COLD ADVECTION WILL ALREADY BE                    
UNDERWAY BUT A SECONDARY SHOT OF COLD AIR WILL ARRIVE WITH THE VORT             
MAX BY AFTERNOON. MOISTURE WILL BE FAIRLY MEAGER WITH PWATS AROUND A            
QUARTER INCH WITH A MODEST INCREASE AHEAD OF THE WAVE. WITH THE COLD            
ADVECTION /H85 TEMPS FALLING FROM -6 C TO -12 C DURING THE DAY/ THE             
DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE LOWERS INTO THE LAYER OF HIGHER MOISTURE                  
CONTENT AND ASCENT. EXPECT MOISTURE AND FORCING WILL BE SUFFICIENT              
FOR SNOW SHOWERS TO BE WRUNG OUT FROM MID/LATE MORNING THROUGH THE              
AFTERNOON. WITH THE COLD ADVECTION SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SHOULD BE               
ELEVATED AND FEEL THAT UP TO A HALF INCH MAY ACCUMULATE ACROSS THE              
EAST CENT WI COUNTIES AND A DUSTING TO A QUARTER INCH ACROSS THE                
FAR EAST CENT MN CWA.                                                           
BY TUESDAY THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN WILL BE MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED THAN              
IT IS CURRENTLY WITH A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND A             
BROAD RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVERHEAD                
TUESDAY MORNING. THE PRESENCE OF THE HIGH COMBINED WITH THE COLD AIR            
BROUGHT BY THE PASSING FRONT WILL SUPPORT TUESDAY MORNING TEMPS IN              
THE TEENS TO AROUND 20 DEGREES. THE FLOW PATTERN WILL FAIRLY BLOCKED            
UP SO THE HIGH WILL TAKE ITS TIME CROSSING THE AREA INTO WEDNESDAY.             
WEDNESDAY CONTINUES TO LOOK QUIET ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION.                    
THINGS GET MORE COMPLEX INTO THANKSGIVING DAY AND THROUGH THE                   
HOLIDAY WEEKEND. GFS AND ECMWF ARE AT ODDS WITH THE HANDLING OF THE             
FLOW COMING INTO THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. THIS AFTERNOONS               
WATER VAPOR SHOWS A VERY SHARP AND DEEP LONGWAVE TROUGH STRETCHING              
FROM ALASKA SOUTHWARD ALONG AREAS BETWEEN 140W AND 145W AND                     
EXTENDING AS FAR SOUTH AS 30N AND BEYOND. ANOTHER DEEP TROUGH IS                
RACING INTO THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THIS TROUGH FROM THE ALEUTIANS             
WITH ANOTHER WAVE ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE TROUGH NEAR 30N. BOTH THE            
GFS AND ECMWF CLOSE THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE TROUGH OFF BY MONDAY            
MORNING. THIS OCCURS AS THE ALEUTIAN TROUGH ROUNDS THE SOUTHERN                 
PERIPHERY OF THE CIRCULATION OVER ALASKA AND DIGS TOWARDS THE                   
BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST. THE HANDLING OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED NORTHERN            
AND SOUTHERN STREAMS...WITH A REX BLOCK OVER THE WESTERN                        
ROCKIES...IS THE SOURCE OF DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS FROM                   
THURSDAY ONWARD. THERE ARE OTHER AFFECTS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY              
BUT THE IMPACT ON SENSIBLE WEATHER IS ESSENTIALLY NIL DURING THOSE              
DAYS.                                                                           
HAVE NOT MADE MANY CHANGES TO THE FORECAST BEYOND THURSDAY GIVEN THE            
LACK OF CONTINUITY AMONG THE SOLUTIONS THUS FAR. THE 12Z/23 GFS CAME            
IN WITH QUITE A CHANGE...BRINGING A SHORTWAVE SOUTHWARD IN THE                  
NORTHERN STREAM THURSDAY. THE 12/23 ECMWF HAS COME AROUND TO THIS               
TYPE OF EVOLUTION AS WELL...BUT IS A BIT SLOWER. THE IDEA OF A                  
TROUGH RIDING DOWN THE RIDGE PORTION OF THE REX BLOCK IS                        
REASONABLE...ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE CURRENT INTENSITY OF THE                 
UPPER LOW WHICH SPAWNS THIS TROUGH. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE NEXT FEW             
RUNS BUT THE CHANCE OF ADDING OF POPS FOR THANKSGIVING DAY AND

HEELS. MAIN UPPER LOW CIRCULATION IS SAGGING SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS              
LAKES WINNIPEG AND MANITOBA WITH TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING                          
SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. A VORTICITY MAXIMA IS              
QUICKLY MOVING EAST-NORTHEAST TOWARDS CENTRAL MN AND NORTHERN WI                
THIS AFTERNOON EXHIBITED BY NARROW CHANNEL OF SHARP DRYING WORKING              
ALONG THE ND/SD BORDER. SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS WELL ORGANIZED SFC LOW               
OVER NORTHERN MANITOBA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE CLOSED UPPER LOW.                
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS TO ITS SOUTHEAST ACROSS                           
WESTERN/CENTRAL ONTARIO. A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS SOUTHWARD              
ALONG THE MN/DAKOTAS BORDER AND MEETS UP WITH A WEAK SFC LOW ACROSS             
EASTERN NEBRASKA.                                                               
SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA AT 21Z WILL CONTINUE              
EAST-NORTHEAST THIS EVENING. UPPER JET ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSED               
LOW OVER MANITOBA APPEARS TO BE FURTHER WEST THAN EARLIER FORECASTS             
/AS IS THE LOW ITSELF/ RESULTING IN A DECREASED AFFECT FROM THE LEFT            
EXIT REGION. UPPER JET CURRENTLY INCREASING ACROSS IOWA SHOULD                  
PROVIDE A BRIEF WINDOW OF LEFT FRONT QUAD ASCENT EARLY THIS EVENING             
BEFORE THAT SHIFTS TO THE EAST. NONETHELESS FORCING FOR ASCENT IS               
EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH ENCOUNTERS THE SFC                 
INVERTED TROUGH. CURRENT RADAR MOSAIC SHOWS BANDS OF MID LEVEL                  
RETURNS WITH LITTLE SHOWING UP IN SFC OBS DUE TO LOW LEVEL DRY AIR              
THAT IS STILL BEING OVERCOME. THIS WILL BE THE CHALLENGE THROUGH THE            
EVENING AS DECENT FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING IN THE H7-H6 LAYER SAGS               
SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA. MUCH OF THE FORCING WILL GO TOWARDS               
SATURATION EARLY ON...WITH A LARGE DRY WEDGE STILL SHOWING UP ON                
RECENT AIRCRAFT SOUNDINGS FROM KMSP. DO EXPECT SNOW TO FALL TO THE              
SURFACE DURING THE EARLY EVENING ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL CWA BEFORE            
SHIFTING SOUTHEAST. DUE TO THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM DURATION OF SNOW             
WILL BE SHORT LIVED...PROBABLY JUST A COUPLE HOURS...WHICH WILL                 
LIMIT AMOUNTS. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE FORCING BRIEF PERIODS OF                 
MODERATE SNOW ARE EXPECTED AND A QUICK COUPLE TENTHS MAY BE                     
RECEIVED. GENERALLY ABOUT A HALF INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM NEW ULM             
TO THE TWIN CITIES TO RICE LAKE AND POINTS SOUTHEAST. SOME ISOLATED             
LOCATIONS MAY SEE AROUND AN INCH. AREAS ALONG THE IA BORDER MAY SEE             
LITTLE PRECIP WITH DRY AIR MOVING IN ALOFT AS SEEN ON LATEST WATER              
VAPOR IMAGERY. A BRIEF WINDOW OF RAIN/SNOW MIX MAY OCCUR BETWEEN                
NOW AND 01Z OR SO WITH WARM LOW LEVEL TEMPS BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS              
SHOW WET BULB TEMPS TO BE BELOW ZERO THROUGH THE COLUMN ALLOWING                
EVAPORATIVE COOLING DURING THE TOP DOWN SATURATION TO YIELD JUST                
ABOUT ALL SNOW AT ONSET. THE WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE TO THE SOUTHEAST            
SO MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL END BY MIDNIGHT. SKIES MAY EVEN SCATTER              
OUT FOR A PERIOD PRIOR TO DAYBREAK AS SUBSIDENCE FILLS IN BEHIND THE            
WAVE.                                                                           
THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL/NORTHERN MANITOBA WILL CONTINUE            
TO DROP SOUTHEASTWARD ENTERING THE ARROWHEAD BY MIDDAY. CYCLONIC                
VORTICITY ADVECTION WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF ATTENDANT VORT MAX WHICH             
SWINGS FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN                      
TWO-THIRDS OR SO OF THE AREA. COLD ADVECTION WILL ALREADY BE                    
UNDERWAY BUT A SECONDARY SHOT OF COLD AIR WILL ARRIVE WITH THE VORT             
MAX BY AFTERNOON. MOISTURE WILL BE FAIRLY MEAGER WITH PWATS AROUND A            
QUARTER INCH WITH A MODEST INCREASE AHEAD OF THE WAVE. WITH THE COLD            
ADVECTION /H85 TEMPS FALLING FROM -6 C TO -12 C DURING THE DAY/ THE             
DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE LOWERS INTO THE LAYER OF HIGHER MOISTURE                  
CONTENT AND ASCENT. EXPECT MOISTURE AND FORCING WILL BE SUFFICIENT              
FOR SNOW SHOWERS TO BE WRUNG OUT FROM MID/LATE MORNING THROUGH THE              
AFTERNOON. WITH THE COLD ADVECTION SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SHOULD BE               
ELEVATED AND FEEL THAT UP TO A HALF INCH MAY ACCUMULATE ACROSS THE              
EAST CENT WI COUNTIES AND A DUSTING TO A QUARTER INCH ACROSS THE                
FAR EAST CENT MN CWA.                                                           
BY TUESDAY THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN WILL BE MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED THAN              
IT IS CURRENTLY WITH A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND A             
BROAD RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVERHEAD                
TUESDAY MORNING. THE PRESENCE OF THE HIGH COMBINED WITH THE COLD AIR            
BROUGHT BY THE PASSING FRONT WILL SUPPORT TUESDAY MORNING TEMPS IN              
THE TEENS TO AROUND 20 DEGREES. THE FLOW PATTERN WILL FAIRLY BLOCKED            
UP SO THE HIGH WILL TAKE ITS TIME CROSSING THE AREA INTO WEDNESDAY.             
WEDNESDAY CONTINUES TO LOOK QUIET ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION.                    
THINGS GET MORE COMPLEX INTO THANKSGIVING DAY AND THROUGH THE                   
HOLIDAY WEEKEND. GFS AND ECMWF ARE AT ODDS WITH THE HANDLING OF THE             
FLOW COMING INTO THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. THIS AFTERNOONS               
WATER VAPOR SHOWS A VERY SHARP AND DEEP LONGWAVE TROUGH STRETCHING              
FROM ALASKA SOUTHWARD ALONG AREAS BETWEEN 140W AND 145W AND                     
EXTENDING AS FAR SOUTH AS 30N AND BEYOND. ANOTHER DEEP TROUGH IS                
RACING INTO THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THIS TROUGH FROM THE ALEUTIANS             
WITH ANOTHER WAVE ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE TROUGH NEAR 30N. BOTH THE            
GFS AND ECMWF CLOSE THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE TROUGH OFF BY MONDAY            
MORNING. THIS OCCURS AS THE ALEUTIAN TROUGH ROUNDS THE SOUTHERN                 
PERIPHERY OF THE CIRCULATION OVER ALASKA AND DIGS TOWARDS THE                   
BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST. THE HANDLING OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED NORTHERN            
AND SOUTHERN STREAMS...WITH A REX BLOCK OVER THE WESTERN                        
ROCKIES...IS THE SOURCE OF DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS FROM                   
THURSDAY ONWARD. THERE ARE OTHER AFFECTS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY              
BUT THE IMPACT ON SENSIBLE WEATHER IS ESSENTIALLY NIL DURING THOSE              
DAYS.                                                                           
HAVE NOT MADE MANY CHANGES TO THE FORECAST BEYOND THURSDAY GIVEN THE            
LACK OF CONTINUITY AMONG THE SOLUTIONS THUS FAR. THE 12Z/23 GFS CAME            
IN WITH QUITE A CHANGE...BRINGING A SHORTWAVE SOUTHWARD IN THE                  
NORTHERN STREAM THURSDAY. THE 12/23 ECMWF HAS COME AROUND TO THIS               
TYPE OF EVOLUTION AS WELL...BUT IS A BIT SLOWER. THE IDEA OF A                  
TROUGH RIDING DOWN THE RIDGE PORTION OF THE REX BLOCK IS                        
REASONABLE...ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE CURRENT INTENSITY OF THE                 
UPPER LOW WHICH SPAWNS THIS TROUGH. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE NEXT FEW             
RUNS BUT THE CHANCE OF ADDING OF POPS FOR THANKSGIVING DAY AND                  
PERHAPS INTO FRIDAY IS INCREASING.  ..MDB..

THE FORECAST CHALLENGE CENTERS ON THE SNOW POSSIBILITIES                        
TONIGHT...MAINLY IN SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST MN.                             
EARLY MORNING GOES SATELLITE CHANNELS AND OBS INDICATING LOW                    
CLOUDS GRADUALLY ADVECTING NEWARD...WITH BACK-EDGE LIKELY TO CLEAR              
SOUTH CTRL MN IF NOT MUCH OF THE MN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA                
THROUGH THE MORNING. HIGH CLOUDS BEGINNING TO STREAM IN FROM THE                
WEST ORIGINATING FROM NEXT SYSTEM. WILL BE A WINDOW FOR SOME SUN                
IN SRN AND POSSIBLY ERN COMMUNITIES INTO THE EARLY AFTN. THIS                   
SHOULD ALLOW FOR WARMER AND POSITIVE 925-850MB TEMPS TO BE MIXED                
DOWN...WITH HIGHS TODAY STILL FORECASTED TO BE IN THE LOWER 40S                 
ACROSS SRN MN INTO WRN WI. THESE HIGHS AND OTHERS ACROSS THE AREA               
TODAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN NORMAL AND OVERALL THE WARMEST               
DAY SINCE THE 14TH.                                                             
INTEREST TURNS TO SYSTEM COMING OUT OF WY LATER THIS AFTN. THIS IS              
ANOTHER PACIFIC/ALBERTA-CLIPPER LIKE SYSTEM IN WNW FLOW. THE 06Z                
NAM HAS TRENDED FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE 00Z NAM...AND MORE IN LINE               
WITH THE SHORT RANGE FORECAST ENSEMBLE AND 00Z GFS. COMPARED TO                 
THE FRI NIGHT SYSTEM WHICH DROPPED WIDESPREAD LIGHT SNOW ACROSS                 
THE AREA...THIS ONE IS NOT AS DEEP IN THE H5 HEIGHTS AND TEMPS OR               
OVERALL PV ANOMALY. HOWEVER...THIS HAS MUCH BETTER MOISTURE TO                  
WORK WITH AND WILL BE IN THE DEEPENING PHASE AS IT PASSES JUST                  
SOUTH OF MN THIS EVE. THIS SYSTEM WILL PHASE OVER THE GREAT LAKES               
ON MON WITH A STRONGER ONE DIVING IN FROM THE NW. BUT AS IT BEGINS              
TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THAT UPSTREAM SYSTEM IT WILL DEEPEN THIS                 
EVE...PLACING SRN MN IN DEFORMATION ZONE OF THIS SYSTEM. THIS                   
CORRELATES WELL WITH A LEFT EXIT REGION OF A PREDICTED 95 KT JET.               
GREATEST PRESSURE ADVECTION ON THE ISENTROPIC SURFACES IS FOCUSED               
OVER SOUTH CTRL MN THIS EVE WHERE MOISTENING OCCURS FAIRLY RAPIDLY              
ACCORDING TO CROSS SECTIONS. MIXING RATIOS ON THE SURFACES OF                   
UPGLIDE ARE 2 TO 2.5 G/KG WITH PRECIPITABLE WATERS NEAR 150                     
PERCENT OF NORMAL. THESE VALUES ARE GREATER THAN THE FRI NIGHT                  
SYSTEM. DENDRITIC GROWTH LAYER IS FAIRLY DEEP /50-70MB/ AND OMEGA               
IS FOUND WITHIN THAT LAYER. PROFILE BELOW THIS QUICKLY WARMS                    
HOWEVER AND SOME PARTIAL TO COMPLETE MELTING IS EXPECTED AT                     
FIRST...ESPECIALLY GIVEN BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS IN THE UPPER 30S                  
EARLY THIS EVE ACROSS SRN MN. FRONTOGENESIS FOR FOCUS SNOW BANDS                
DEVELOPS AS EARLY AS THIS AFTN BUT CORRELATES WITH THE                          
AFOREMENTIONED FORCING AND MOISTENING MAINLY DURING THE EVE IN SRN              
MN. SO POTENTIAL FOR BRIEF MODERATE SNOW DOES THEREFORE EXIST.                  
BRIEF THOUGH IS THE KEY...AS SYSTEM IS ON THE MOVE FAIRLY QUICKLY               
EAST. A BAND OF ONE TO TWO INCHES APPEARS LIKELY TO SET-UP                      
SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH CTRL MN...WITH A BROADER AREA OF UP TO ONE INCH              
ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF SRN AND ERN MN AND INTO WRN WI.                         
MERGING SYSTEMS IN THE GREAT LAKES WILL OFFER BACK-SIDE COLD AIR                
ADVECTION BY MON AFTN WITH CLOUDS AND SOME ISOLD SNOW SHOWERS AND               
FLURRIES. H8 TEMPS NOT AS LOW AS IN RECENT DUMPS OF COLD AIR. SO                
TEMPS TO DROP TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL FOR MON INTO TUES AND THEN               
BACK TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE INTO THE HOLIDAY. FOR THE HOLIDAY TRAVELERS              
ON WEDS AND INTO THANKSGIVING...QUIET WEATHER LOOKS TO CONFIDENTLY              
PREVAIL IN THIS REGION. FRI THE PATTERN BECOMES MORE                            
UNSETTLED...WITH THE WRN LAKES SURROUNDED BY SYSTEMS OF DECENT                  
MAGNITUDE. ALL OF THEM THOUGH SEEM TO BE BLOCKING THE                           
FLOW...LIKELY PREVENTING ANY MAJOR PRECIP ON FRI AND KEEPING TEMPS              
FROM CLIMBING OR DROPPING MUCH INTO NEXT WEEKEND.

THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS SNOWFALL POTENTIAL               
ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...IN ASSOCIATION WITH A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE               
AND COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE.                                                       
IN THE MEANTIME...LOW CLOUDS OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN CWA WILL                     
LINGER THIS EVENING...WITH EXPANSION NORTH/EAST AS LOW LEVEL WINDS              
SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING TROUGH. EXPECT THE                
STRATUS TO KEEP TEMPERATURES ELEVATED TONIGHT...WITH LOWS                       
GENERALLY IN THE LOW/MID 20S. COOLER READINGS IN THE UPPER TEENS                
WILL BE POSSIBLE IN WEST CENTRAL WI...WHERE CLOUD COVER WILL BE                 
LESS EXTENSIVE. AS THE CLOUDS EXPAND NORTH/EAST...SOME SCATTERING               
MAY OCCUR IN WEST/SOUTH CENTRAL MN. THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE                      
OPPORTUNITY FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT. HAVE NOT INCLUDED IT IN THE GRIDS              
AT THIS POINT...AS ATTENDANT VISIBILITY REDUCTIONS ARE ONLY                     
EXPECTED TO FALL INTO THE 3SM-5SM RANGE.                                        
THE TROUGH PASSES ACROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH 290K UPGLIDE                 
AND LOWERING CONDENSATIONAL PRESSURE DEFICITS PROGGED TO BE                     
SITUATED OVER THE CWA. A PV ANOMALY ALSO COMES INTO PLAY ON SUNDAY              
NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING...AND INTERACTS WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL              
RH ACROSS CENTRAL MN AND WEST CENTRAL WI. SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE                
PRECIP TYPE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON WOULD LIKELY BE A RAIN/SNOW                     
MIX...WITH A TRANSITION TO SNOW ON SUNDAY EVENING. SNOWFALL                     
AMOUNTS CIRCA ONE INCH OR LESS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH MONDAY. LIGHT               
SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE MN/WI BORDER               
INTO WEST CENTRAL WI THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY               
ROUNDS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE GREAT LAKES LOW.                            
A RATHER BENIGN WEATHER PATTERN IS IN STORE FROM TUESDAY THROUGH                
NEXT FRIDAY...AS A QUASI-OMEGA BLOCKING PATTERN DEVELOPS OVER THE               
CONUS. THIS WILL YIELD PREDOMINATELY DRY WEATHER AND SLIGHTLY                   
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THE THANKSGIVING                 
HOLIDAY. THE PATTERN BREAKS DOWN TOWARD NEXT WEEKEND...BUT TIMING               
IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT. HAVE THEREFORE STAYED THE COURSE WITH               
A DRY FORECAST THROUGH NEXT SATURDAY.

LATEST RUC HAS BACKED OFF ON ERODING THE CLOUDS OVERNIGHT AND THIS              
LOOKS REASONABLE BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS. EROSION IS OCCURRING IN               
NERN NEBRASKA AND HAVE INDICATED SCATTERING OUT MID TO LATE

THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH ENTERING THE WESTERN DAKOTAS PER 20Z WATER VAPOR           
IMAGERY WILL BE THE FOCUS LOCALLY OVER THE NEXT 18 HOURS...AS IT                
CLOSES OFF AND SLIDES EAST/SOUTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHERN MN. ASSOCIATED             
850-700MB OMEGA AND 2D FRONTOGENESIS BLOSSOM OVER THE SOUTHERN CWA              
AROUND 03Z...BUT EXPECT THE BULK OF THE SNOWFALL TO OCCUR BETWEEN               
06Z AND 12Z WHEN THE LOW LEVEL SATURATION OCCURS. THE DYNAMICS...WHILE          
BRIEFLY IMPRESSIVE...ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF SYNC WITH THE ARRIVAL OF               
THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...SO SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF ONE INCH OR               
LESS STILL APPEAR REASONABLE ALONG/SOUTH OF THE MN RIVER VALLEY.                
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY NAM/GFS/RUC PROGGED COBB OUTPUTS FOR KFRM AND              
KRWF.                                                                           
TEMPERATURES AT WESTERN CWA LOCATIONS WILL LIKELY REMAIN ELEVATED IN            
THE LOW 20S TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE CLOUD COVER AND WARM           
AIR ADVECTION. EASTERN AREAS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DIP INTO THE            
SINGLE DIGITS AGAIN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WEST CENTRAL WI. LOW/MID CLOUDS         
WILL LINGER ON SATURDAY...BUT TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE TO AROUND              
FREEZING.                                                                       
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM EVEN MORE ON SUNDAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING              
TROUGH...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 30S AND LOWER 40S EXPECTED. THE RELATED        
COLD FRONT PASSES ACROSS THE CWA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT...AS SHORTWAVE       
ENERGY ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF AN AMPLIFYING EASTERN CONUS TROUGH           
STREAMS ACROSS MN AND WI. THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT ACROSS

STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS RETURNED TO THE AREA LEADING TO MUCH                  
WARMER TEMPERATURES /IN MOST LOCALES/ AND HIGHER DEW POINTS THAN                
SEEN YESTERDAY. AREA OF LOW CLOUDINESS ACROSS SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA HAS            
BEEN SLOW TO ERODE/PUSH TO THE EAST...WHICH HAS HELD HIGH                       
TEMPERATURES DOWN FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY TODAY. THIS WILL HAVE AN                 
EFFECT ON LOW TEMPERATURES IN THAT AREA TONIGHT. LOW CLOUDINESS                 
HAS BEEN SHOWING A SLOW EAST TO NORTHEASTWARD MOVEMENT...ALTHOUGH               
TAMDAR SOUNDINGS ACROSS NORTH TEXAS SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD NOT                  
THIN MUCH THIS AFTERNOON. NAM12 AND RUC 850MB RH PROGS SHOW THAT                
SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD LINGER THIS EVENING ACROSS                       
SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA SO HAVE CONTINUED A MENTION OF MOSTLY CLOUDY                 
SKIES GENERALLY TO THE SOUTHEAST OF A LINE FROM HUGO TO

WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES IN THIS AREA BEFORE A NEW BATCH OF LOW                  
CLOUD COVER DEVELOPS LATER TONIGHT. AS FAR AS LOW TEMPERATURES                  
GO...WILL MONITOR THE TEMPERATURE/SATELLITE TRENDS IN SOUTHEAST                 
OKLAHOMA CLOSELY PRIOR TO ISSUING ANY FORECAST PRODUCTS AND AMEND               
FORECAST AS NECESSARY. WITH CLOUD COVER AND ADVECTION OF HIGHER                 
DEW POINTS...EXPECT THAT LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S              
TO NEAR 40 ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40.                      
LATEST GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO POINT TOWARD SHOWERS ACROSS FAR                    
EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS...ESPECIALLY LATE TOMORROW              
AND TOMORROW NIGHT...AS MOISTURE TRANSPORT MAXIMIZES AHEAD OF THE               
FRONT /PER 295K SURFACE/. CONTINUED WITH LIKELY POPS IN THIS                    
REGION. HIGHS TOMORROW COULD BE A LITTLE TRICKY...WITH TIGHT                    
GRADIENT IN CLOUD COVER EXPECTED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST.                   
LARGELY WENT ABOVE GUIDANCE VALUES ALONG AND NORTHWEST OF                       
INTERSTATE 44...WHERE LESS CLOUD COVER IS EXPECTED.                             
DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION ON THE                  
HEELS OF THE FRONT...WITH FAR NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA AND NORTHWEST                  
ARKANSAS FEELING THE MOST EFFECTS OF THE COOLER AIR. RIDGING                    
BUILDS INTO THE CENTRAL CONUS FOR THE BEGINNING TO MIDDLE PART OF               
THE WEEK. GENERALLY WENT NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE MEX GUIDANCE                
VALUES THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 850 MB TEMPERATURES FROM THE 12Z ECMWF                
WOULD SUGGEST HIGHER TEMPERATURES THAN THAT FOR THE MIDDLE PART OF              
THE WEEK...BUT THIS RUN SEEMS ANOMALOUS WITH ITS PREVIOUS                       
RUNS...AS WELL AS THE GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE...SO HAVE DISCOUNTED

MAJOR CHANGE TO THE EXTENDED FROM PREVIOUS FORECASTS WAS TO DELAY               
THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION LATE IN THE WEEK ASSOCIATED WITH THE                 
WARM ADVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THE LARGE TROUGH IN THE WESTERN

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...LOW TOPPED SHOWERS                  
CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE ALONG A COASTAL FRONT EXTENDING                
ALONG THE DEEP S TX COAST TO NEAR RKP. MOISTURE POOLING ALONG THIS              
BOUNDARY WILL LEAD TO PWS INCREASING TO NEAR 1.5 INCHES OVERNIGHT.              
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE WILL BE HIGH ENOUGH TO                     
SUPPORT SCT SHRA ALONG THIS FEATURE...WHICH WILL WEAKEN AND SLOWLY              
MOVE NORTH ON SUN. A WEAK S/WV OVER NERN MEXICO SEEN ON RUC                     
ANALYSIS AND GFS MAY ALSO PROVIDE SOME WEAK UPWARD MOTION LATE                  
TONIGHT AND SUN BUT A MID LEVEL CAP SHOULD LIMIT MOST PRECIP TO                 
SHRAS BELOW THE INVERSION. H85 FLOW WILL TURN FROM SSE TO A MORE                
SRLY DIRECTION BY EARLY SUN AND THIS SUGGESTS HIGHEST POPS WILL BE              
ACROSS AREAS NEAR/EAST OF I37 WITH CRP RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE                 
MORE SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS. MAV POPS LOOK OK...EXCEPT THINK POPS

(30-50%) TO AREAS EAST OF HIGHWAY 281 WITH HIGHEST ALONG AND EAST               
OF A CRP TO BEEVILLE LINE BOTH TONIGHT AND SUN.                                 
AS THE H85 FLOW VEERS MORE SWRLY SUN AFTN AND EVENING THE                       
MOISTURE AXIS WILL SHIFT MORE INTO THE MID AND UPR TEXAS COAST.

20% OFF MAV VALUES SHOWING 20-30% ONLY FOR THE ERN 3RD (JUST                    
CLIPPING CRP) SUN NIGHT. CLOUD COVER AND WAA PATTERN SUGGEST LOWS

WARMEST TEMPERATURES OF THE PERIOD (LOWER 80S SOUTH/UPPER 70S

THREE QUARTERS IN TRAINING CELLS. THE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO                    
STABILIZE AND DRY DURING SUNDAY AFTERNOON FROM WEST TO EAST. SOME               
SUNSHINE SHOULD ARRIVE FOR THE COASTAL BEND SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS

REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS, HOWEVER THAT MAINLY AFFECTED THE BAY AND ATLANTIC       
ZONES. ALL OTHER ELEMENTS UNCHANGED AS THE PREVIOUS FORECAST

FOWEY HAS BEEN AT 20 TO 23 KNOTS THIS EVENING FOR THE PAST FEW                  
HOURS. SO, HAVE DECIDED TO PLAY IT SAFE AND KEEP THE SCA GOING                  
THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE BAY AND ATLANTIC ZONES. ADDED THE BAY                 
SINCE EASTERLY WINDS WILL AFFECT THE CENTRAL SECTIONS. THE MIAMI-               
DADE AND BROWARD COASTAL WATERS WILL THE ZONES MOST AFFECTED SINCE              
THE GRADIENT IS TIGHTER TO THE SOUTH, HOWEVER ALSO KEPT THE PALM BEACH

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST ACROSS ALL SOUTH FLORIDA TERMINALS                  
THIS FORECAST CYCLE...WITH THE PRIMARY CONCERN BEING WINDS. ALL                 
AVAILABLE GUIDANCE NOW SUGGESTS THAT PRESSURE GRADIENT AND                      
RESULTING ENE FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN OVER THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT...                 
WHICH MAY BE THE KEY FACTOR IN DEVELOPMENT OF A LAND BREEZE. AT                 
THIS TIME...WILL INDICATE NO LAND BREEZE AT PBI/FLL...AS EASTERLY               
FLOW SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO PREVENT A PENETRATION THIS                
CLOSE TO THE COAST. HOWEVER...AT TERMINALS FURTHER INLAND...WILL                
INDICATE WINDS BACKING TO NNW AND DECREASING IN THE PREDAWN HOURS               
ON MONDAY. WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHTER AND FROM THE NE OVERNIGHT AT               
KAPF...WITH ESE FLOW OF 8-12 KNOTS EXPECTED AT ALL TERMINALS                    
DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. OTHERWISE...CLOUD CONDS OF FEW050/SCT070              
WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE PERIOD...AND ENOUGH THREAT FOR SHRA TO                 
INCLUDE VCSH ALONG THE EAST COAST OVERNIGHT.

DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE WILL PULL AWAY FROM THE MID ATLANTIC                 
COAST TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...RESULTING IN OUR PREVAILING WINDS                
TURNING MORE EASTERLY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY...THOUGH                 
BELIEVE THE GFS/NAM ARE A BIT TOO BULLISH ON THIS. KEPT SLIGHT                  
CHANCE POPS NEXT FEW DAYS FOR THE ATLANTIC COAST...BUT OTHERWISE                
MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.                                     
MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE FCST IS AGAIN ON THE LAND BREEZE AND               
ITS EFFECTS ON TEMPS AGAIN TONIGHT...AND MONDAY NIGHT AS WELL.                  
GFS/NAM AND EVEN THE WRF DO NOT SHOW THE LAND BREEZE DEVELOPING                 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE PATTERN IS NOT CHANGING MUCH AND SO WE                   
BELIEVE IT WILL OCCUR. THE NAM/WRF LOOK WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH                 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...AND THEY START THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND                    
BREEZE EARLY ON BEFORE THE WINDS SURGE TAKES OVER SWITCHING WINDS               
BACK NE. SINCE THIS SURGE LOOKS TO AGGRESSIVE...DECIDED TO                      
DISCOUNT THIS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING IS                  
AGAIN EXPECTED IN A STILL RATHER DRY AIRMASS...DECIDED TO BRING                 
THE LAND BREEZE ACROSS MUCH OF THE EAST COAST METRO AREAS AGAIN                 
TONIGHT...BUT NOT QUITE TO THE COAST...REASON BEING THAT IT MADE                
IT TO THE COAST JUST FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING...AND ANY SLIGHT                  
INCREASE IN THE NE-E WIND OVERNIGHT WOULD HOLD IT AT BAY. SHOULD                
MENTION THAT THE RUC IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR                 
EXPECTATIONS TONIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACT THE FCST ON THE LAND BREEZE               
HAS IS WITH REGARDS TO TEMPS...AS IT CAN FLUCTUATE 5-10F DEGREES                
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY...AS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW                      
MORNING`S.                                                                      
KEPT PATCHY FOG IN THE FCST TONIGHT AND MON NIGHT. MON NIGHT LOOKS              
TO BE MOST OPTIMAL...AHEAD OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH.                             
GFS/ECMWF STILL SHOW THE COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY              
NIGHT INTO WED MORNING...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVING BY ON                 
TUESDAY. AFTER TEMPS WARM FINALLY TO NEAR 80 AHEAD OF THE FRONT                 
TUESDAY...A SLIGHT COOL DOWN WILL OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE                 
FRONT. MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED...SO MOSTLY DRY WEATHER IS                  
ANTICIPATED.                                                                    
MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FCST. THE DRY NOVEMBER WEATHER                  
PATTERN LOOKS TO CONTINUE. BOTH GFS/ECMWF SHOW A GRADUAL WARMING                
TREND LATE IN THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND...WITH YET ANOTHER                 
COLD FRONT EXPECTED EITHER SUNDAY OR MONDAY...DEPENDING ON THE                  
MODEL...AND JUST TOO EARLY TO TELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME...BUT THE              
PARADE OF FRONTS LOOK TO CONTINUE.                                              
MARINE...DECIDED TO EXTEND THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR THE                     
ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING...AS GULF STREAM SEAS WILL                 
LIKELY NOT START SUBSIDING UNTIL LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT DUE TO              
THE FACT THAT WINDS WILL REMAIN FROM A MORE NE DIRECTION BEFORE                 
BECOMING EASTERLY LATER TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...WINDS OVER THE NEXT                
FEW DAYS WILL SLACKEN LEADING TO IMPROVING MARINE CONDITIONS. THE               
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY...SWITCHING                
WINDS TO W-NW...AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE                  
AREA TUE NIGHT INTO EARLY WED MORNING...WITH A BRIEF WIND SURGE                 
EXPECTED BEHIND IT...BUT GUIDANCE SUGGESTS ONLY 15-20 KT AND NOT                
TOO PROLONGED.                                                                  
FIRE WEATHER...RH`S HAVE BEEN DOWN AGAIN TO NEAR 40 PERCENT AS                  
SOME DRY AIR HAS MIXED DOWN. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE JUST A TAD                  
ON MONDAY. SLIGHT DRYING IS EXPECTED TUESDAY BEHIND A PRE-FRONTAL               
TROUGH...BUT NOT EXPECTED TO BE DRY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO RESULT               
IN CRITICAL RH`S. HOWEVER...WILL MONITOR TRENDS...BECAUSE TUE WILL              
BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK...AND IF MORE DRYING OCCURS BETWEEN              
THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT...THEN RH`S COULD              
FALL LOWER THAN FCST. THE DRIEST AIR WILL ADVECT IN ACROSS THE                  
AREA BEHIND THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. TRENDED DEW POINTS/RH`S                     
DOWN...THOUGH NOT AS LOW AS THE NAM AT THIS TIME...WHICH DROPS DEW              
POINTS TO THE LOWER 30S NW INTERIOR TO THE LOWER 40S SE. WE LIKELY              
WILL NEED TO CONTINUE A DECREASING TREND IN COMING FCSTS.

LEVELS BETWEEN 700-500 MB AND COLD ADVECTION BETWEEN 925-800 MB.                
THIS WILL RESULT IN LIMITED MIXING POTENTIAL ON TUESDAY WITH AN                 
INVERSION ABOVE 900 MB AND COOLER THAN TODAY WHEN BETTER MIXING                 
OCCURS. THE UPPER LOW WILL LINK UP WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY NOW MOVING            
THROUGH SOUTHERN IOWA AND MISSOURI AND CREATE A DEEP CLOSED LOW OVER            
THE NORTHEASTERN CONUS AND WILL SLOW THE FLOW OVER THE MIDWEST                  
TUESDAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY AIR WILL BE             
IN PLACE DURING THIS PERIOD ALONG WITH LIGHT NORTHWEST FLOW AND                 
SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.                                                          
THE 850 MB THERMAL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH IOWA ON                    
THURSDAY...HOWEVER MUCH LIKE TONIGHT...WEAK COLD ADVECTION IS                   
ANTICIPATED TO TAKE PLACE BELOW 900 MB AND EFFECTIVELY STRENGTHEN               
THE INVERSION IN PLACE. THIS WILL LIMIT HIGH TEMPERATURES ON                    
THURSDAY TO NEAR CLIMATOLOGY WITH MIXING ONLY TO 950-925 MB. THE 06Z            
NAM IS MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH THE LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION ON                    
THANKSGIVING DAY. REGARDLESS...EXPECT GOOD TRAVELING CONDITIONS ON              
THURSDAY. SOME DIFFERENCES AMONG SOLUTIONS REMAIN FRIDAY AND INTO               
THE WEEKEND THOUGH OVERALL TRENDS ARE TO SUPPRESS THE SOUTHERN                  
PLAINS SYSTEM EVEN FURTHER SOUTH AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT BRINGING

INCLUDED PREVAILING FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST IN CASE                  
SMOKE RETURNS. OTHERWISE EXPECT SLIGHT RESTRICTIONS TO VIS ALL

TREND OF BRINGING SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS INTO KLCH/KBPT BY

ALTHOUGH LIKE LAST NIGHT THE GFS APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE WETTER AND              
FASTER THAN THE NAM. THUS HAVE TIMED THE PREVAILING POPS IN THE

MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS ARE THE AMOUNT OF SNOW THE NEXT TWO DAYS...              
ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE.

UPSTREAM AT CYQD WILL STAY UNDER OR TO THE WEST OF THE UPPER LOW.               
HOWEVER...SOME COOLING IS STILL EXPECTED TO COME INTO UPPER MICHIGAN            
WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW. NAM/GFS SHOW 850MB TEMPS FALLING            
TO -8 TO -10C OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR...WHICH WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH               
FOR LAKE ENHANCED OR PERHAPS EVEN PURE LAKE EFFECT. WITH NW WINDS...            
IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY FOR SNOW IN WRN UPPER MI...ESPECIALLY IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS. HAVE RAISED POPS TO DEFINITE IN THE UPSLOPE AREA FROM            
IWD TO ROCKLAND. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SOMEWHERE               
AROUND 10 TO 1...DUE TO MAJORITY OF VERTICAL MOTION BELOW THE                   
DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH ZONE...WHICH WITH A BLEND OF NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW            
RUN/GFS FOR QPF RESULTS IN 1 TO 2 INCHES. THE AMOUNT OF COLD AIR                
CROSSING CENTRAL AND LAKE SUPERIOR IS A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN...                
WITH THE GFS SHOWING -8 TO PERHAPS -10C AT 00Z TUE...COMPARED TO THE            
NAM AND LOCAL WRF-ARW WHICH HAVE -4 TO -6C. EITHER SCENARIO SEEMS AT            
LEAST POSSIBLE FOR LAKE ENHANCED PCPN...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THERE             
WILL BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE AROUND IN THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD OF            
THE UPPER LOW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WARMER SCENARIO WOULD RESULT             
IN POTENTIAL FOR RAIN TO MIX IN...PARTICULARLY OVER LAKE SUPERIOR               
AND OVER LAND NEAR THE SUPERIOR SHORELINE. GIVEN 00Z SOUNDING FROM              
CWPL UPSTREAM WAS -6C...WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW. THE            
WARMER SCENARIO ALSO MEANS THAT ANY SNOW THAT FALLS INLAND WILL ALSO            
BE WETTER WITH SNOW TO WATER RATIOS LESS THAN 10 TO 1. COULD BE AN              
INCH...PERHAPS TWO OF THIS WET SNOW IN THE EASTERN CWA. THE CENTRAL             
U.P. LOOKS TO BE MAINLY DRY TODAY...WITH SOME SUN AS THE DRY-SLOT               
WORKS IN. A FEW -SHSN COULD WORK IN OVER MQT COUNTY OFF OF WRN                  
SUPERIOR IN THE AFTN...BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT FOR CENTRAL UPPER MI.               
ALTHOUGH COLD AIR IS FLOWING IN...EXPECT HIGHS AGAIN TODAY IN THE               
30S...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING NW WINDS AND NEAR LAKE             
SUPERIOR WITH HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER.                                   
TONIGHT...UPPER LOW MOVES SE INTO OHIO BY 12Z TUE...COMING CLOSE TO             
PHASING WITH THE SHRTWV CURRENTLY HEADING EAST OUT OF SRN IA. AS A              
RESULT...THE SFC LOWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN NW ONTARIO AND SE IA END            
UP MERGING TOGETHER INTO A DEEPER 1003 MB LOW NEAR LONDON ONTARIO AT            
12Z TUE. THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS TO STRENGTHEN NORTH TO NE WINDS                
OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. NORMALLY THIS WOULD SPELL COLDER AIR                
MOVING IN. HOWEVER...THE AIR COMING IN IS EITHER JUST AS COOL OR                
PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN THE AIR THAT IS IN OVER THE CWA AT            
00Z PER 850MB TEMP PROGS. THE REASON IS THAT THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS            
TO PULL WARMER AIR IN OFF THE ATLANTIC INTO ITS CIRCULATION. SO WITH            
LITTLE TO NO CHANGE IN 850MB TEMPS...LAKE ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE THE             
RULE...POSSIBLY PURE LAKE EFFECT IN THE WRN U.P.. PROBLEM IN THE WRN            
U.P. COMPARED TO TODAY IS THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER                  
LOW...INVERSIONS FALL WITH THE MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES. THE QUESTION             
IS IF THE -10C ISOTHERM DRIES OUT...WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE PCPN FROM            
SNOW TO FZDZ GIVEN THAT AN UPSLOPING WIND CONTINUES. RIGHT NOW ONLY             
OUR LOCAL WRF-ARW RUN SHOWS THIS OCCURRING...WHILE THE NAM/GFS SHOW             
THE -10C ISOTHERM REMAINING MOIST. THEREFORE HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP               
THE P-TYPE AS SNOW. IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST...INVERSIONS WILL                   
GRADUALLY LOWER AS WELL...BUT NOT AS QUICK. SO CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER             
THAT THE P-TYPE WILL STAY AS SNOW INLAND FROM LAKE SUPERIOR. AMOUNTS            
OF SNOW SHOULD NOT BE THAT IMPRESSIVE...MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO GIVEN              
LOW SNOW TO WATER RATIOS. REGARDING AREAS NEAR THE LAKE...THE WARMER            
NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW RUNS SUGGEST HOLDING ON TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX THROUGH            
AT LEAST 09Z. IF THE PCPN IS GENERALLY LIGHT...THEN MORE OF THE PCPN            
SHOULD FALL AS RAIN. GIVEN THE WARMER 850MB TEMPS AND PLENTY OF                 
CLOUDS...ALONG WITH A FLOW OF AIR OFF THE WARM LAKE SUPERIOR                    
WATER...TEMPS SHOULD NOT DROP TOO MUCH. COLDEST READINGS EXPECTED IN            
THE INTERIOR WEST...CLOSEST TO THE COLDEST 850MB AIR...BUT EVEN                 
THESE SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE MID 20S.                                            
TUESDAY...UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO SHIFT INTO NORTH CENTRAL PA BY 00Z            
WED...WITH THE SFC LOW MOVING TO THE LAKE ONTARIO AREA. THIS ALLOWS             
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BUILD INTO WESTERN UPPER MI BY 00Z...IN                
ADDITION TO CONTINUED MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES THROUGH THE DAY. THE               
RIDGE SHOULD BRING DRIER AIR IN...LIKELY TO THE WESTERN CWA...ENOUGH            
TO END PCPN BY EARLY AFTN. HOWEVER...THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CWA                
WILL STAY IN LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED UNDER THE LOWERING INVERSION...                 
ENHANCED BY LAKE SUPERIOR GIVEN COOL AIR BELOW THE INVERSION. PCPN              
TYPE IS VERY TRICKY...AS ALL MODELS SHOW THE -10C LAYER DRYING OUT              
THROUGH THE DAY. GIVEN A NORTH WIND OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR...SET            
UP IS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE. SO WITH LAKE ENHANCEMENT OFF LAKE                  
SUPERIOR AND UPSLOPE FLOW PRODUCING VERTICAL MOTION...SOME PCPN                 
SHOULD OCCUR OUT OF THE CLOUDS. RIGHT NOW HAVE GONE WITH EITHER SNOW            
SHOWERS OR DZ/FZDZ (FZDZ OVER INLAND AREAS THROUGH THE EARLY AFTN).             
POPS ARE HIGHEST IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL IN THE               
MORNING...THEN DECREASE IN THE AFTN AS THE DRIER AIR TRIES TO WORK              
IN. GIVEN CLOUD COVER AND 850MB TEMPS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN             
TODAY...HIGHS WILL ALSO END UP SLIGHTLY COOLER. STILL...MOST                    
LOCATIONS SHOULD BE IN THE 30S...WARMEST IN THE DOWNSLOPE AREAS OF              
THE SOUTH CENTRAL.                                                              
TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU...PER THE UKMET/NAM/GFS/ECMWF...UPPER MI LOOKS            
TO BE CAUGHT IN SQUEEZE-PLAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER CANADA             
AND THE NORTHERN U.S. BECOMES BLOCKED. THIS BLOCKING LOOKS TO BE A              
RESULT OF STRONG RIDGING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW TO OUR                 
EAST. IN FACT...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER LOW               
BACK TO THE NW DURING THIS PERIOD...BASICALLY PULLED BY THE CURRENT             
SHRTWV CROSSING SRN IA. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR UPPER MI IS A PERSISTENT            
CHANCE FOR -SN ACROSS THE EAST HALF OF UPPER MI CLOSER TO THE DEEPER            
MOISTURE AROUND THE UPPER LOW...WHILE THE WEST HALF OF UPPER MI IS              
DRY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LOW INVERSIONS              
AND THE SURFACE RIDGE. STILL MAINTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME                 
DZ/FZDZ OVER THE EASTERN CWA TUE NIGHT SINCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT            
THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE IN UNTIL WED. ANY PCPN LOOKS TO BE                
LIGHT AT THE CURRENT TIME DUE TO LACK OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WITH              
THE UPPER LOW. GIVEN THE BLOCKED PATTERN...NO SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR            
WARMING IS PLANNED. THEREFORE... LOWS AND HIGHS ARE FORECAST TO BE              
ABOUT THE SAME THROUGH THE PERIOD...IN THE 20S AND 30S RESPECTIVELY.            
BEYOND THU...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE. 00Z ECMWF/GFS/GFS                     
ENSEMBLES ARE ALL IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF             
A BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR FRI              
INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS TROUGH IS FORMED BY A COMBINATION OF THE                 
UPPER LOW TO OUR EAST ON THU AND ANOTHER TROUGH DROPPING DOWN OUT OF            
CENTRAL CANADA. THIS MEANS THAT GRADUAL COOLING WILL OCCUR...COLD               
ENOUGH TO SET UP PURE LAKE EFFECT BY THE WEEKEND.                               
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION (FOR THE 06Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
LIGHT SNOW ASSOCIATED WITH A TROUGH MOVING THROUGH UPPER MICHIGAN               
COULD BRING A PERIOD OF MVFR VSBY. WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTENING...MVFR             
CIGS ARE ALSO EXPECTED WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR OCNL IFR CIGS.                    
THEN...AS NORTHWEST TO NORTHERLY FLOW SETS UP AND COLD AIR MOVES IN             
ALOFT...-SHSN WILL BECOME POSSIBLE...MAINLY AT KCMX IN THE                      
AFTERNOON. BY MONDAY EVENING...ADDITIONAL LAKE ENHANCED SNOW MAY BE             
POSSIBLE AT KSAW AS CONVERGENT NNE FLOW DEVELOPS BEHIND THE

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A LOW PRES TROF EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN ONTARIO ACROSS THE UPPER                
GREAT LAKES TO THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL CONSOLIDATE                
INTO A LOW PRES CENTER OVER SRN LAKE HURON THIS EVENING. AS THIS                
OCCURS...NRLY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR THIS            
AFTN AND MORE SO THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. EXPECT NRLY WINDS IN               
THE 20-30KT RANGE TONIGHT WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF THE LAKE. IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS            
COULD OCCUR...BUT SINCE THERE IS A LACK OF COLD AIR ADVECTION TO                
INCREASE MIXING...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION OF GALES. PROGRESSION            
OF THE MAIN WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL SLOW TO A CRAWL TUE THRU FRI. WITH             
LOW PRES TO THE E AND HIGH PRES TO THE W...N TO NW WINDS WILL BE THE            
RULE TUE THRU FRI WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS REMAINING OVER THE E HALF            
OF LAKE SUPERIOR. OVERALL...AFTER TUE...WINDS SHOULD GENERALLY BE IN

.SYNOPSIS...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL LOW OFF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA                 
COAST WILL SLOWLY MOVE TOWARD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TODAY...BRINGING              
WET WEATHER TO THE REGION TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. AFTER A BRIEF              
BREAK ON WEDNESDAY...A STORM SYSTEM WILL BRING ADDITIONAL RAIN TO               
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THURSDAY. AFTER THAT HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING            
DRIER WEATHER TO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.                 
&&

STRONG UPPER TROUGH JUST EAST OF 140 W THIS MORNING WITH SPLITTING              
FLOW EVIDENT AND AN IMPRESSIVE DRY SLOT EXTENDING NORTH TO SOUTH                
ALONG THE TROUGH AXIS. MODELS ARE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH             
THIS FEATURE...BRINGING THE UPPER LOW TOWARD THE COAST...ALTHOUGH               
WHILE NAM AND GFS BRING AN OPEN WAVE ONSHORE EARLY WEDNESDAY THE                
ECMWF MAINTAINS A CLOSED LOW CIRCULATION. NEVERTHELESS ALL SOLUTIONS            
POINT TOWARD A DECENT CHANCE OF RAIN ON TUESDAY AS MOIST FLOW WRAPS             
AROUND THE LOW AND INTO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM THE SOUTH TO                   
SOUTHEAST. THE MAIN VORT MAX IS HEADED FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...AND            
THE BEST INSTABILITY IS LIKELY TO STAY SOUTH OF THE CWA AS WELL. GFS            
IS STILL HINTING AT SOME SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE GETTING PULLED INTO               
THE FLOW AND HEADING NORTHWARD...BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN THE MANNER OF             
A CLASSIC PINEAPPLE CONNECTION. MODELS CONTINUE THE SLOWING TREND SO            
TRIMMED BACK POPS SLIGHTLY FOR THE MONDAY NIGHT PERIOD...AND ALLOWED            
CHANCE POPS TO INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH ON TUESDAY. SHOWERS WILL                 
DECREASE FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO                    
WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW MAKES LANDFALL SOUTH OF PT CONCEPTION...AND                
BEGINS TO MOVE INLAND TOWARD VEGAS AND THE 4 CORNERS STATES. THIS               
WILL ALLOW SOME ANTICYCLONIC ROTATION TO DEVELOP OVER THE PACIFIC               
NORTHEAST AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WEDNESDAY...AS ANOTHER STRONG LOW             
HEADS ACROSS THE GULF OF ALASKA.                                                
.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...MODELS SHOW REASONABLE            
AGREEMENT IN HANDLING OF THE NEXT LOW FORECAST TO APPROACH THE                  
PACIFIC NORTHWEST LATER THIS WEEK. TIMING HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT TO                
FAVOR PRECIP AFFECTING MAINLY THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE CWA ON               
THURSDAY...SPREADING SOUTHWARD ON THURSDAY NIGHT....AND DECREASING              
TO THE NORTHEAST ON FRIDAY. FOR THE WEEKEND THE MODELS ALL INDICATE             
A LOW FORMING ON THE EAST SIDE OF A LONGWAVE RIDGE IN THE EASTERN               
PACIFIC. BY 12Z SATURDAY THE GFS AND EC ARE JOINED BY THE CANADIAN              
IN FORMING A CUTOFF LOW SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTHERN                               
CALIFORNIA/NORTHERN BAJA VICINITY...AS A STRONG RIDGE CONTINUES TO              
BUILD INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. BY SUNDAY THE GFS IS MOST                     
AGGRESSIVE IN WESTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE CUTOFF...PUSHING IT OFFSHORE             
SOUTH OF 30 N. THIS TYPE OF SOLUTION FAVORS DRY WEATHER FOR

NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO SHORT LIVED HIGH PRESSURE THAT WILL BUILD              
IN NORTH OF THE AREA. A MIXED SWELL WILL MOVE INTO THE WATERS LATER             
THIS MORNING DUE TO THE LOW PRESSURE SOUTH OF THE AREA. THE DOMINANT            
SWELL WILL STILL BE OUT OF THE WEST AT 5 TO 6 FT...WITH A SOUTHERLY             
SWELL MOVING IN AT 3 FT. PERIODS WILL BE 11 SECONDS OUT OF THE WEST

LOW PRESSURE IN THE GREAT LAKES TODAY WILL SPREAD PRECIPITATION INTO            
NEW ENGLAND TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF RAIN. THE               
SYSTEM MAY BRING STRONG WINDS AS WELL...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST.              
COOLER AND DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW MIDWEEK ON.           
&&

915 AND 1015 AM MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO GRID TRENDS THIS MORNING. RUC              
13 VIA TSECS HAS THE BEST HANDLE ON CURRENT AND NEAR TERM CLOUD BANDS           
NR 7000 FT. GRIDS MODIFIED.                                                     
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY MOVE OFF THE COAST TODAY AS LOW            
PRESSURE APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THE RESULT WILL BE INCREASING HIGH           
CLOUDINESS...BUT ANY PRECIPITATION WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL THIS EVENING             
OR TONIGHT. IN FACT...WE MAY SEE A GOOD AMOUNT OF FILTERED SUNSHINE             
TODAY.                                                                          
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL           
DAYS AS THE FLOW GOES SOUTH AND THE AIRMASS WARMS. EVEN STILL...HIGH            
TEMPS WILL TOP OUT AROUND 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. MAXES WERE DERIVED            
FROM A BLEND OF NAM 2M TEMPS AND MAVMOSGUIDE...WITH SLIGHTLY MORE               
WEIGHT GIVEN TO THE MOS.

.SHORT TERM /8 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...                        
1110 AM... ISSUING HIGH WIND WATCH BOSTON TO MANCHESTER AND POINTS              
EAST TO CAPE ANN. SE WIND HIGH WIND CASES IN OUR CLIMO ARE RARE BUT             
MARGINAL HIGH WIND CASE ENVISIONED PER MODEL PRES CHANGES... LAPSE              
RATES...BL AND 925 MB WINDS BOTH 12Z GFS/NAM. NAM BL WINDS ARE UP TO            
38 KTS NOW AT CONCORD. THAT SEEMS A LITTLE HIGH BUT PER COLLAB WITH             
GYX...ADDED ASH TO MHT. GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN SIGNIFICANT POWER                
OUTAGES AND SUSTAINED WIND 40 OR GREATER IS MQE AND BOS TO LWM REGION           
EWD. MAY SEE GUST 60 KTS AT MQE. WIND ADVY WILL BE ISSUED REMAINDER             
I95 REGION OF RI AND MASS AT 4PM.                                               
REMAINDER BLO FROM 4AM...                                                       
CLOUDS WILL RAPIDLY INCREASE EARLY THIS EVENING AS LOW PRESSURE                 
CONTINUES TO APPROACH. THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD WILL ARRIVE FROM WEST           
TO EAST...STARTING IN THE CT VALLEY SOMETIME BETWEEN 02Z AND                    
06Z...THEN SPREADING EASTWARD FROM THERE. THE DOMINANT PRECIPITATION            
TYPE WILL BE RAIN...ALTHOUGH A PORTION OF NW MASS AND SW NH MAY SEE A           
BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW AT THE START. NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.           
ATTM...THE THINKING IS THAT THE SFC TEMPS WILL WARM UP ENOUGH TO                
ALLOW FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF FREEZING RAIN IF ANY AT ALL. IT WOULD BE           
EXTREMELY ISOLATED AT BEST. WENT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS FOR ALL ZONES            
BY LATE AT NIGHT. TEMPS WILL SLOWLY RISE OVERNIGHT AS THE LOW LEVEL             
JET GETS GOING.                                                                 
RAIN WILL BECOME HEAVY AT TIMES TUESDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY THE                
WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA...BEFORE SHIFTING TO THE EASTERN HALF DURING            
THE AFTERNOON. CATEGORICAL POPS FOR ALL AREAS. BEST GUESS AT THIS               
TIME IS THAT A GENERAL .75 TO 1.5 INCHES OF RAIN WILL FALL...WITH               
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. THIS SHOULDN/T CAUSE WIDESPREAD FLOODING                
PROBLEMS. HOWEVER...WE/LL LIKELY SEE THE NORMAL MINOR URBAN/POOR                
DRAINAGE FLOODING AT TIMES. WENT WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF                        
THUNDER...MAINLY FOR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES...AS WEAK INSTABILITY           
MAY DEVELOP AS THE LLJ PUMPS NORTHWARD A DECENT PLUME OF THETA-E.               
THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR TUESDAY MAY BE THE WINDS...AS A 65 KNOT                 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET DEVELOPS. THIS MAY LEAD TO SPEEDS OF WIND               
ADVISORY CRITERIA IF NOT ISOLD MARGINAL HWW CRITERIA TUESDAY                    
AFTERNOON ALONG THE SOUTH COAST AND POSSIBLY THE REST OF EASTERN                
MASS. THE HIGHER TERRAIN MAY BE AFFECTED AS WELL. SUBSEQUENT SHIFTS             
MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER ADVISORIES/WATCHES/WARNINGS. ANY CONVECTION                
COULD BRING DOWN ISOLD STRONG WIND GUSTS AS WELL...ESPECIALLY IF SFC            
TEMPS REALLY WARM UP.                                                           
THERE MAY BE A 1-2 FOOT SURGE ON THE SOUTH COAST BAYS WITH THE STRONG           
SOUTHERLY LLJ....BUT TIDES ARE LOW AND PRESSURE FALLS NOT OVERLY                
IMPRESSIVE. THEREFORE...NO COASTAL FLOODING PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED AT            
THIS TIME.                                                                      
MODEL MAX TEMPS FOR TUESDAY LOOKED TOO LOW. THESE SOUTHERLY LLJ                 
EVENTS ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCE HIGHER SURFACE TEMPS THAN WHAT MOS AND             
EVEN MODEL 2M TEMPS INDICATE. WENT FOR MID 50S ACROSS EASTERN MASS/RI           
AND PORTIONS OF CT. COOLER TEMPS /40S - LOW 50S/ WILL BE FOUND ACROSS           
THE INTERIOR ALTHOUGH IT/S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL NEED TO BE             
RAISED AS WELL.                                                                 
OCCLUSION WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION EARLY TUE EVENING.  NAM              
IS THE SLOWEST MOVING THE OCCLUSION THROUGH AND BRINGS A SLUG OF                
HEAVY RAIN TO E MA INTO SE NH AT THE NOSE OF A PERSISTENT SELY LLJ.             
CONSENSUS AMONG OTHER MODELS INCLUDING GFS FAVORS A FASTER SOLUTION             
SO WE LEANED TOWARD GFS WHICH LIFTS THE HEAVIER RAFL NORTH AND EAST             
OF SNE BY TUE EVENING.  HOWEVER...SOME RAIN WILL LIKELY LINGER                  
ACROSS NE ZONES NEAR THE NOSE OF THE LLJ SO WE WILL HAVE LIKELY TO              
CATEGORICAL POPS TUE EVENING FROM SW NH THROUGH E MA WITH LOWER POPS            
FURTHER SW AS DRY SLOT MOVES IN.  ALSO...GFS INSTABILITY PARAMETERS             
SUGGEST ISOLD ELEVATED THUNDER POSSIBLE E MA THROUGH SE NH.                     
TREND TUE NIGHT WILL BE FOR DECREASING POPS AS THE DRY SLOT MOVES               
THROUGH. WIND MAY STILL BE A CONCERN TUE EVENING FROM CAPE COD                  
THROUGH CAPE ANN WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE LLJ AND WILL HAVE                 
HIGHER GUSTS IN THIS REGION. COLDER AIR WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE IN TUE             
NIGHT AS UPPER LOW REMAINS TO THE NW WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT. MIN             
TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM UPPER 20S FAR NW TO MID/UPPER 30S COASTAL                 
PLAIN.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...                                        
CLOSED LOW LIFTS NWD INTO CANADA WED. MAY GET ENOUGH DRYING FOR SOME            
SUNSHINE WED MORNING BUT CLOUDS SHOULD QUICKLY FILL BACK IN                     
ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERIOR. CANT RULE OUT A FEW RA/SNW SHOWERS AS               
SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATES AROUND THE UPPER LOW. BEST CHC WILL BE ACROSS          
NW ZONES CLOSEST TO THE COLD POOL ALOFT. SEASONABLE TEMPS EXPECTED              
WED.                                                                            
THERE ARE MODEL DIFFERENCES IN THE HANDLING OF CLOSED LOW TOWARD THE            
END OF THE WEEK.  ECMWF NOW MOVES CLOSED LOW BACK SWD ACROSS NEW ENG            
BUT THIS IS THE OUTLIER AS GFS/UKMET/GGEM KEEP LOW WELL TO THE NORTH            
WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN BY FRI.  FOLLOWED CONSENSUS AND             
WILL HAVE DRY FCST FOR THU/FRI WITH SEASONABLE TEMPS.                           
UPPER VORTEX SETS UP NEAR JAMES BAY FOR THE WEEKEND WITH LONG WAVE              
TROF ACROSS GT LAKES BUT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE MODEL SPREAD IN THE              
HANDLING OF SHORTWAVES ROTATING THROUGH.  ECMWF/GFS HAVE A STORM FOR            
THE WEEKEND BUT IT LOOKS TO BE MOSTLY WET.  WE WILL HAVE CHC POPS               
FOR SAT/SUN ALTHOUGH ECMWF DRIES IT OUT FOR SUN.

STRONG PIECE OF UPPER LEVEL ENERGY IS DIVING SOUTH OUT OF WESTERN               
ONTARIO INTO THE GREAT LAKES. THESE TWO FEATURES WILL CONSOLIDATE               
OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS INTO AN ENERGETIC UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE             
OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHWARD TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ON                  
EITHER SIDE OF THIS TROUGH WE FIND LONGWAVE RIDING ALONG BOTH THE               
EAST AND WEST COASTS. SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE FEED IS ALSO SEEN                
MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS MEXICO INTO THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY. LARGE               
SCALE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH MID-LEVEL HEIGHT FALLS IS COMBINING WITH             
THIS UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE AND VIGOROUS WWA IN THE LOWER LEVELS TO               
PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN TEXAS TO              
THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS.                                                 
IN THE LOWER LEVELS...SURFACE RIDGING FROM THE CAROLINA COAST                   
SOUTHWARD INTO NORTHERN FLORIDA WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND SLIDE               
EAST THROUGH THE DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM TO OUR                
NORTHWEST AND ASSOCIATED APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT IS                
CURRENTLY LOCATED FROM THE OHIO VALLEY SOUTHWARD INTO THE WESTERN               
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY.                               
AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT CONTINUE TO                    
APPROACH THROUGH THE DAY WILL EXPECT THE CLOUDS ALREADY IN PLACE                
ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND            
EASTWARD. HOWEVER THIS MAY BE A SLOWER PROCESS THE FURTHER EAST ONE             
GETS AND STILL EXPECT TO SEE A GOOD DEAL OF SUN WELL INTO THE                   
AFTERNOON OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN BIG BEND FROM PERRY TO CROSS CITY.              
VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG THE MODEL SUITES AS TO THE EVOLUTION OF               
THIS FRONT AND THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS THIS EVENING INTO EARLY                 
TUESDAY MORNING. 850MB THETA-E RIDGE AND ASSOCIATED FORCED ASCENT               
DOES NOT ARRIVE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE/SOUTHEAST ALABAMA UNTIL            
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY THIS EVENING. ALTHOUGH A STRAY SHOWER             
CAN NOT BE RULED OUT OVER THIS AREA DURING THE EARLY AND MIDDLE                 
AFTERNOON HOURS...THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF TILL NEAR                
DARK AND INTO THE EVENING HOURS. SURFACE INSTABILITY IS EXTREMELY               
LIMITED WITH SREF PROBS OF EVEN 500 J/KG HOLDING BELOW 5% OVER LAND.            
HOWEVER...THERE IS INITIALLY SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY ALOFT PROGGED            
BY GUIDANCE AS SHOWALTER INDICES APPROACH ZERO OVER THE WESTERN                 
ZONES DURING THE EVENING HOURS. WITH THIS IN MIND WOULD NOT BE                  
SURPRISED TO GET A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER WITH THE BAND OF                      
SHOWERS...HOWEVER ANY STRONG STORM POTENTIAL APPEAR VERY UNLIKELY.              
COLD FRONT IS THEN EXPECTED TO STEADILY PUSH SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE               
AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT AND EXIT THE SOUTHEAST BIG BEND NEAR OR                  
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE TUESDAY MORNING. INITIAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY IS              
PROGGED TO SHEAR OUT RAPIDLY TO THE NORTHEAST AS THE MAIN TROUGH                
ORGANIZES WELL TO THE NORTH. AS THIS OCCURS THE LARGE SCALE LIFT                
OVERHEAD ALL BUT COLLAPSES. MOISTURE AXIS BECOMES RATHER STRUNG OUT             
INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST ARE AS WELL. WITH ALL THIS IN             
MIND SHOULD EXPECT A RATHER SOLID LINE OF RAIN/EMBEDDED STORMS OVER             
THE WEST THIS EVENING TO WEAK AND THIN OUT AS IT MOVES EAST AFTER               
MIDNIGHT. SHOWALTER INDICES SHOW A LESSENING OF THE ELEVATED                    
INSTABILITY INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES AND WILL NOT BRING THUNDER                   
MENTION EAST OF THE APALACHICOLA RIVER. FAR EASTERN AREA FROM                   
VALDOSTA INTO THE EASTERN FLORIDA BIG BEND MAY ONLY SEE A QUICK                 
LINE OF LIGHTER SHOWERS PASS THROUGH LATE TONIGHT WITH VERY LITTLE              
IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION.                                                     
ANY LINGERING SHOWERS SHOULD EXIT THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA BIG BEND                
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE WITH CLOUDS RAPIDLY DECREASING THROUGH THE                
MORNING. EXPECTING A PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY AFTERNOON ALMOST                    
REGION-WIDE WITH A GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHWEST WIND AND HIGH TEMPS IN

HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS AND SLIDES EAST INTO THIS EVENING ALLOWING                
WINDS TO COME AROUND TO THE SOUTHEAST AND EVENTUALLY SOUTH LATER                
TODAY. COLD FRONT CROSSES THE WATERS FROM WEST TO EAST TONIGHT WITH             
A SHARP WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH. WINDS WILL INCREASE             
IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT TO CAUTIONARY LEVELS WITH A PERIOD OF                  
ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS POSSIBLE INTO TUESDAY AFTERNOON. NORTHERLY                 
FLOW WILL REMAIN ELEVATED NEAR CAUTIONARY LEVELS THROUGH TUESDAY                
NIGHT. WINDS WILL THEN RAPIDLY DIMINISH INTO THE DAYLIGHT HOURS                 
WEDNESDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF               
OF MEXICO. THIS HIGH WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE FORECAST WATERS              
PROVIDING LIGHT WINDS AND SEAS THROUGH THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT

VFR CIGS (6-12K FT) WILL INCREASE FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST TODAY

LESS THAN 10 KT. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHRA WILL AFFECT KDHN BY LATE

MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE REMAINS WITH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD                      
PRECIPITATION TYPE AND WHETHER ANY OF THE POSSIBLE SNOW WILL                    
ACCUMULATE OVER MONDAY MORNINGS RUSH HOUR. THE NAMS WARMER                      
SOLUTION FROM YESTERDAY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE WINNER WITH THIS               
EVENT AS THE SECONDARY SOUTHERN LOW HAS PROPAGATED INTO EASTERN                 
IOWA LEAVING OUR REGION IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR THE TIME BEING.                  
WITH THE WARM AIR ADVECTION TAKING PLACE...THE LOW LEVEL                        
TEMPERATURE PROFILES HAVE BEEN WELL ABOVE FREEZING WITH AN ACARS                
SOUNDING OUT OF ORD SHOWING TEMPS UP TO 44F AT 4KFT. TEMPERATURES               
ACROSS THE REGION REALLY ARENT AS COLD AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE                 
FOR A SNOW EVENT...WHICH IS MAINLY DUE TO FACT THAT THERE ISNT A                
STRONG HIGH TO OUR NORTH...RATHER ANOTHER SURFACE LOW THAT IS                   
BOGARTING ALL THE COLD AIR. SFC TEMPS ARE IN THE UPPER 20S/LOW 30S              
BACK IN THE DAKOTAS AND 850MB TEMPS RANGE FROM 0 TO -2 FROM                     
DUBUQUE BACK TO FARGO. ALL IN ALL...FEEL AS THOUGH THIS DOESNT                  
HAVE THE BEST SETUP BUT WITH ENOUGH EVAPORATIVE COOLING AND                     
SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR WRAPPING IN ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS WEAK LOW                
THAT SOME VERY WET SNOW WILL REMAIN A POSSIBILITY THIS

A FEW OBS HAVE COME IN WITH UNKNOWN PRECIP...BUT THIS AND                       
EVERYWHERE ELSE IN NORTHEAST ILLINOIS AND NORTHWEST INDIANA HAS                 
JUST BEEN RAIN SO FAR THIS MORNING. AS OF 3AM...MOST OF THE SNOW                
WAS CONFINED TO SOUTHERN WISCONSIN UP TOWARD MSN AND WEST OF                    
THERE. WILL HAVE THE BEST SHOT FOR ANY SNOW THIS MORNING FROM                   
12-15Z WORKING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WILL                 
KEEP SOME VERY MINOR TENTHS OF ACCUMULATION UP ALONG THE WI/IL                  
BORDER SINCE SOIL TEMPS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE 30S WITH THE RECENT               
COLD SPELL WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MOST OF NOVEMBER. SNOW RATIOS WILL                
BE VERY LOW...ON THE ORDER OF 9 TO 1 OR LESS WITH THE WETNESS OF                
THIS SNOW.                                                                      
AS THE TWO SYSTEMS MERGE MONDAY MORNING...THE PRECIP SHOULD COME                
TO AN END FAIRLY QUICKLY BEFORE 18Z AND SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO                   
CLEAR OUT A BIT AND LET THE SUN OUT IN THE AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD               
HELP TEMPERATURES TO BRIEFLY CLIMB UP TO AROUND 40 OR SO. SKIES                 
WILL CLOUD UP AGAIN TOWARD EVENING AS THE CORE OF THE UPPER LOW                 
DIVES DOWN THROUGH WISCONSIN ON INTO NORTHEAST ILLINOIS AND                     
SOUTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN. THIS COLD PUNCH OF AIR ALONG WITH SOME                  
POSITIVE VORTICITY ADVECTION SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH FORCING TO SEE               
SOME SCATTERED FLURRIES OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.

LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE BELOW FREEZING. ACARS DESCENT SOUNDING                 
INTO ORD AT 11Z DEPICTS THIS WELL.  BOTH CIGS AND VSBYS HAVE                    
DROPPED TO IFR OR LIFR AS THE CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE PASSES

WILL IMPROVE CONSIDERABLY BY MID-DAY...THOUGH A FEW LINGERING SNOW              
SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN ANY REMAINING LOW STRATUS. WINDS WILL

UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO DROP SOUTHEASTWARD OUT OF WESTERN ONTARIO                
TOWARDS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR THIS MORNING. EVENTUALLY UPPER LOW                
WILL MERGE WITH S/WV OVER SOUTHERN LAKE MI FORMING BROADER UPPER LOW            
OVER SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES. WEAK SFC LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN                 
LOWER MI WILL MOVE SLOWLY EWD TO SOUTHERN LAKE HURON BY THE END OF              
THE DAY.  BACK EDGE OF LIGHT SNOW FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE                   
FEATURES HAS MOVED INTO LAKE MI.  BEST CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW THIS               
AFTERNOON WILL BE EAST OF A MANISTIQUE TO NEWBERRY LINE AND EVEN                
THERE AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT. AS MAIN UPPER LOW DROPS SOUTHEASTWARD            
ACROSS FAR WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR EXPECT FLURRIES/-SHSN TO ACCOMPANY             
IT. WITH A SLIGHTLY WESTWARD UPPER LOW TRACK EXPECT BEST CHANCE OF              
THIS ACTIVITY ACROSS WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN WITH CENTRAL AREAS                  
REMAINING PRECIP FREE THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. 85H TEMPS WILL FALL              
INTO THE -8 TO -10 RANGE OVER WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR AND AS WINDS                
BECOME MORE NORTHWESTERLY DO EXPECT SOME LAKE ENHANCEMENT TO OCCUR              
IN FAVORABLE UPSLOPE AREAS IN THE WEST. STILL NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING            
MORE THAN AN INCH OR AT MOST 2 OF ACCUMULATION DURING THE DAY TODAY.            
OVERALL TEMP FORECAST IS ON TRACK AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS             
TO IT.                                                                          
.SYNOPSIS... ISSUED AT 425 AM EST                                               
08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED RIDGING               
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. INTO SW CANADA...RIDGING IN THE OHIO VALLEY               
INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES...AND A TROUGH FROM MANITOBA SOUTHWARD             
INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. WITHIN THE TROUGH...AN UPPER LOW IS LOCATED            
AT THE FAR NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG. THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD             
OF THE UPPER LOW EXTENDS FROM MO ACROSS UPPER MI AND INTO NE                    
ONTARIO. SOME -SN IS FALLING OUT OF THE CONVEYOR BELT OVER THE                  
CENTRAL PORTION OF THE CWA...ALSO IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE BETTER                
MOISTURE IS BASED ON 00Z RAOBS FROM MPX...COMPARED TO GRB AND APX               
WHICH REFLECT THE DRIER AIRMASS OVER EASTERN UPPER MI. A DRY SLOT IS            
EVIDENT ON 11-3.9 U IMAGERY OVER NE MN...BUT FARTHER NW OVER NW MN              
INTO MANITOBA IS THE COLD CONVEYOR BELT (CCB) CLOUDS ON THE BACK                
SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW. 850MB TEMPS UNDER THE CCB WERE AROUND -14C               
BASED ON THE 00Z SOUNDING FROM CYQD...QUITE A BIT COLDER THAN THE               
-1C AT MPX...-4C AT INL AND -6C AT CWPL. TO THE SW OF UPPER MI ON               
WATER VAPOR...A SHRTWV IS MOVING THROUGH SRN IA. ASSOCIATED WITH THE            
SHRTWV IS A 1015MB SFC LOW IN SE IA. A TROUGH EXTENDS NE FROM THE               
LOW ACROSS CENTRAL UPPER MI...THEN HEADS BACK TO THE NW AS A COLD               
FRONT WHERE IT CONNECTS UP TO A 1008MB LOW IN FAR NW ONTARIO.                   
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... ISSUED AT 425 AM EST                                             
MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS ARE THE AMOUNT OF SNOW THE NEXT TWO DAYS...              
ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE.                                      
TODAY...UPPER LOW AT THE NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG IS PROGGED TO               
SLIDE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER WEST COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS 00Z                      
RUNS...MOVING INTO WRN WI AT 00Z TUE. THE BULK OF THE COLD AIR SEEN             
UPSTREAM AT CYQD WILL STAY UNDER OR TO THE WEST OF THE UPPER LOW.               
HOWEVER...SOME COOLING IS STILL EXPECTED TO COME INTO UPPER MICHIGAN            
WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW. NAM/GFS SHOW 850MB TEMPS FALLING            
TO -8 TO -10C OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR...WHICH WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH               
FOR LAKE ENHANCED OR PERHAPS EVEN PURE LAKE EFFECT. WITH NW WINDS...            
IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY FOR SNOW IN WRN UPPER MI...ESPECIALLY IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS. HAVE RAISED POPS TO DEFINITE IN THE UPSLOPE AREA FROM            
IWD TO ROCKLAND. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SOMEWHERE               
AROUND 10 TO 1...DUE TO MAJORITY OF VERTICAL MOTION BELOW THE                   
DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH ZONE...WHICH WITH A BLEND OF NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW            
RUN/GFS FOR QPF RESULTS IN 1 TO 2 INCHES. THE AMOUNT OF COLD AIR                
CROSSING CENTRAL AND LAKE SUPERIOR IS A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN...                
WITH THE GFS SHOWING -8 TO PERHAPS -10C AT 00Z TUE...COMPARED TO THE            
NAM AND LOCAL WRF-ARW WHICH HAVE -4 TO -6C. EITHER SCENARIO SEEMS AT            
LEAST POSSIBLE FOR LAKE ENHANCED PCPN...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THERE             
WILL BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE AROUND IN THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD OF            
THE UPPER LOW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WARMER SCENARIO WOULD RESULT             
IN POTENTIAL FOR RAIN TO MIX IN...PARTICULARLY OVER LAKE SUPERIOR               
AND OVER LAND NEAR THE SUPERIOR SHORELINE. GIVEN 00Z SOUNDING FROM              
CWPL UPSTREAM WAS -6C...WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW. THE            
WARMER SCENARIO ALSO MEANS THAT ANY SNOW THAT FALLS INLAND WILL ALSO            
BE WETTER WITH SNOW TO WATER RATIOS LESS THAN 10 TO 1. COULD BE AN              
INCH...PERHAPS TWO OF THIS WET SNOW IN THE EASTERN CWA. THE CENTRAL             
U.P. LOOKS TO BE MAINLY DRY TODAY...WITH SOME SUN AS THE DRY-SLOT               
WORKS IN. A FEW -SHSN COULD WORK IN OVER MQT COUNTY OFF OF WRN                  
SUPERIOR IN THE AFTN...BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT FOR CENTRAL UPPER MI.               
ALTHOUGH COLD AIR IS FLOWING IN...EXPECT HIGHS AGAIN TODAY IN THE               
30S...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING NW WINDS AND NEAR LAKE             
SUPERIOR WITH HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER.                                   
TONIGHT...UPPER LOW MOVES SE INTO OHIO BY 12Z TUE...COMING CLOSE TO             
PHASING WITH THE SHRTWV CURRENTLY HEADING EAST OUT OF SRN IA. AS A              
RESULT...THE SFC LOWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN NW ONTARIO AND SE IA END            
UP MERGING TOGETHER INTO A DEEPER 1003 MB LOW NEAR LONDON ONTARIO AT            
12Z TUE. THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS TO STRENGTHEN NORTH TO NE WINDS                
OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. NORMALLY THIS WOULD SPELL COLDER AIR                
MOVING IN. HOWEVER...THE AIR COMING IN IS EITHER JUST AS COOL OR                
PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN THE AIR THAT IS IN OVER THE CWA AT            
00Z PER 850MB TEMP PROGS. THE REASON IS THAT THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS            
TO PULL WARMER AIR IN OFF THE ATLANTIC INTO ITS CIRCULATION. SO WITH            
LITTLE TO NO CHANGE IN 850MB TEMPS...LAKE ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE THE             
RULE...POSSIBLY PURE LAKE EFFECT IN THE WRN U.P.. PROBLEM IN THE WRN            
U.P. COMPARED TO TODAY IS THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER                  
LOW...INVERSIONS FALL WITH THE MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES. THE QUESTION             
IS IF THE -10C ISOTHERM DRIES OUT...WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE PCPN FROM            
SNOW TO FZDZ GIVEN THAT AN UPSLOPING WIND CONTINUES. RIGHT NOW ONLY             
OUR LOCAL WRF-ARW RUN SHOWS THIS OCCURRING...WHILE THE NAM/GFS SHOW             
THE -10C ISOTHERM REMAINING MOIST. THEREFORE HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP               
THE P-TYPE AS SNOW. IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST...INVERSIONS WILL                   
GRADUALLY LOWER AS WELL...BUT NOT AS QUICK. SO CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER             
THAT THE P-TYPE WILL STAY AS SNOW INLAND FROM LAKE SUPERIOR. AMOUNTS            
OF SNOW SHOULD NOT BE THAT IMPRESSIVE...MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO GIVEN              
LOW SNOW TO WATER RATIOS. REGARDING AREAS NEAR THE LAKE...THE WARMER            
NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW RUNS SUGGEST HOLDING ON TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX THROUGH            
AT LEAST 09Z. IF THE PCPN IS GENERALLY LIGHT...THEN MORE OF THE PCPN            
SHOULD FALL AS RAIN. GIVEN THE WARMER 850MB TEMPS AND PLENTY OF                 
CLOUDS...ALONG WITH A FLOW OF AIR OFF THE WARM LAKE SUPERIOR                    
WATER...TEMPS SHOULD NOT DROP TOO MUCH. COLDEST READINGS EXPECTED IN            
THE INTERIOR WEST...CLOSEST TO THE COLDEST 850MB AIR...BUT EVEN                 
THESE SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE MID 20S.                                            
TUESDAY...UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO SHIFT INTO NORTH CENTRAL PA BY 00Z            
WED...WITH THE SFC LOW MOVING TO THE LAKE ONTARIO AREA. THIS ALLOWS             
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BUILD INTO WESTERN UPPER MI BY 00Z...IN                
ADDITION TO CONTINUED MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES THROUGH THE DAY. THE               
RIDGE SHOULD BRING DRIER AIR IN...LIKELY TO THE WESTERN CWA...ENOUGH            
TO END PCPN BY EARLY AFTN. HOWEVER...THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CWA                
WILL STAY IN LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED UNDER THE LOWERING INVERSION...                 
ENHANCED BY LAKE SUPERIOR GIVEN COOL AIR BELOW THE INVERSION. PCPN              
TYPE IS VERY TRICKY...AS ALL MODELS SHOW THE -10C LAYER DRYING OUT              
THROUGH THE DAY. GIVEN A NORTH WIND OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR...SET            
UP IS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE. SO WITH LAKE ENHANCEMENT OFF LAKE                  
SUPERIOR AND UPSLOPE FLOW PRODUCING VERTICAL MOTION...SOME PCPN                 
SHOULD OCCUR OUT OF THE CLOUDS. RIGHT NOW HAVE GONE WITH EITHER SNOW            
SHOWERS OR DZ/FZDZ (FZDZ OVER INLAND AREAS THROUGH THE EARLY AFTN).             
POPS ARE HIGHEST IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL IN THE               
MORNING...THEN DECREASE IN THE AFTN AS THE DRIER AIR TRIES TO WORK              
IN. GIVEN CLOUD COVER AND 850MB TEMPS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN             
TODAY...HIGHS WILL ALSO END UP SLIGHTLY COOLER. STILL...MOST                    
LOCATIONS SHOULD BE IN THE 30S...WARMEST IN THE DOWNSLOPE AREAS OF              
THE SOUTH CENTRAL.                                                              
TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU...PER THE UKMET/NAM/GFS/ECMWF...UPPER MI LOOKS            
TO BE CAUGHT IN SQUEEZE-PLAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER CANADA             
AND THE NORTHERN U.S. BECOMES BLOCKED. THIS BLOCKING LOOKS TO BE A              
RESULT OF STRONG RIDGING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW TO OUR                 
EAST. IN FACT...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER LOW               
BACK TO THE NW DURING THIS PERIOD...BASICALLY PULLED BY THE CURRENT             
SHRTWV CROSSING SRN IA. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR UPPER MI IS A PERSISTENT            
CHANCE FOR -SN ACROSS THE EAST HALF OF UPPER MI CLOSER TO THE DEEPER            
MOISTURE AROUND THE UPPER LOW...WHILE THE WEST HALF OF UPPER MI IS              
DRY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LOW INVERSIONS              
AND THE SURFACE RIDGE. STILL MAINTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME                 
DZ/FZDZ OVER THE EASTERN CWA TUE NIGHT SINCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT            
THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE IN UNTIL WED. ANY PCPN LOOKS TO BE                
LIGHT AT THE CURRENT TIME DUE TO LACK OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WITH              
THE UPPER LOW. GIVEN THE BLOCKED PATTERN...NO SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR            
WARMING IS PLANNED. THEREFORE... LOWS AND HIGHS ARE FORECAST TO BE              
ABOUT THE SAME THROUGH THE PERIOD...IN THE 20S AND 30S RESPECTIVELY.            
BEYOND THU...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE. 00Z ECMWF/GFS/GFS                     
ENSEMBLES ARE ALL IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF             
A BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR FRI              
INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS TROUGH IS FORMED BY A COMBINATION OF THE                 
UPPER LOW TO OUR EAST ON THU AND ANOTHER TROUGH DROPPING DOWN OUT OF            
CENTRAL CANADA. THIS MEANS THAT GRADUAL COOLING WILL OCCUR...COLD               
ENOUGH TO SET UP PURE LAKE EFFECT BY THE WEEKEND.                               
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION (FOR THE 12Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
OVERALL...EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL AT KCMX/KSAW THRU THIS              
FCST PERIOD. WEDGE OF SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR SWEEPING INTO THE AREA                 
AHEAD OF MID/UPPER LOW DROPPING SE TOWARD THE UPPER MIDWEST MAY                 
RESULT IN CLOUDS SCATTERING OUT FOR A WHILE TODAY...BUT CONFIDENCE              
IS LOW IN DETERMINING A TIME PERIOD WHEN THAT MIGHT OCCUR.                      
OTHERWISE...UPPER LOW DROPPING INTO THE VCNTY WILL LIKELY BRING SOME            
-SHSN TO KCMX THIS AFTN AND KSAW THIS EVENING. SOME LAKE ENHANCEMENT            
IS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY AT KSAW AS CONVERGENT NRLY UPSLOPING FLOW              
DEVELOPS. MAY SEE IFR CONDITIONS FOR A TIME LATE EVENING INTO THE               
OVERNIGHT.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A LOW PRES TROF EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN ONTARIO ACROSS THE UPPER                
GREAT LAKES TO THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL CONSOLIDATE                
INTO A LOW PRES CENTER OVER SRN LAKE HURON THIS EVENING. AS THIS                
OCCURS...NRLY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR THIS            
AFTN AND MORE SO THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. EXPECT NRLY WINDS IN               
THE 20-30KT RANGE TONIGHT WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF THE LAKE. IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS            
COULD OCCUR...BUT SINCE THERE IS A LACK OF COLD AIR ADVECTION TO                
INCREASE MIXING...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION OF GALES. PROGRESSION            
OF THE MAIN WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL SLOW TO A CRAWL TUE THRU FRI. WITH             
LOW PRES TO THE E AND HIGH PRES TO THE W...N TO NW WINDS WILL BE THE            
RULE TUE THRU FRI WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS REMAINING OVER THE E HALF            
OF LAKE SUPERIOR. OVERALL...AFTER TUE...WINDS SHOULD GENERALLY BE IN            
THE 15-25KT RANGE OVER THE E AND 10-20KT OVER THE W.

08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED RIDGING               
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. INTO SW CANADA...RIDGING IN THE OHIO VALLEY               
INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES...AND A TROUGH FROM MANITOBA SOUTHWARD             
INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. WITHIN THE TROUGH...AN UPPER LOW IS LOCATED            
AT THE FAR NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG. THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD             
OF THE UPPER LOW EXTENDS FROM MO ACROSS UPPER MI AND INTO NE                    
ONTARIO. SOME -SN IS FALLING OUT OF THE CONVEYOR BELT OVER THE                  
CENTRAL PORTION OF THE CWA...ALSO IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE BETTER                
MOISTURE IS BASED ON 00Z RAOBS FROM MPX...COMPARED TO GRB AND APX               
WHICH REFLECT THE DRIER AIRMASS OVER EASTERN UPPER MI. A DRY SLOT IS            
EVIDENT ON 11-3.9 U IMAGERY OVER NE MN...BUT FARTHER NW OVER NW MN              
INTO MANITOBA IS THE COLD CONVEYOR BELT (CCB) CLOUDS ON THE BACK                
SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW. 850MB TEMPS UNDER THE CCB WERE AROUND -14C               
BASED ON THE 00Z SOUNDING FROM CYQD...QUITE A BIT COLDER THAN THE               
-1C AT MPX...-4C AT INL AND -6C AT CWPL. TO THE SW OF UPPER MI ON               
WATER VAPOR...A SHRTWV IS MOVING THROUGH SRN IA. ASSOCIATED WITH THE            
SHRTWV IS A 1015MB SFC LOW IN SE IA. A TROUGH EXTENDS NE FROM THE               
LOW ACROSS CENTRAL UPPER MI...THEN HEADS BACK TO THE NW AS A COLD               
FRONT WHERE IT CONNECTS UP TO A 1008MB LOW IN FAR NW ONTARIO.                   
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... ISSUED AT 425 AM EST                                             
MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS ARE THE AMOUNT OF SNOW THE NEXT TWO DAYS...              
ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE.                                      
TODAY...UPPER LOW AT THE NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG IS PROGGED TO               
SLIDE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER WEST COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS 00Z                      
RUNS...MOVING INTO WRN WI AT 00Z TUE. THE BULK OF THE COLD AIR SEEN             
UPSTREAM AT CYQD WILL STAY UNDER OR TO THE WEST OF THE UPPER LOW.               
HOWEVER...SOME COOLING IS STILL EXPECTED TO COME INTO UPPER MICHIGAN            
WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW. NAM/GFS SHOW 850MB TEMPS FALLING            
TO -8 TO -10C OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR...WHICH WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH               
FOR LAKE ENHANCED OR PERHAPS EVEN PURE LAKE EFFECT. WITH NW WINDS...            
IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY FOR SNOW IN WRN UPPER MI...ESPECIALLY IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS. HAVE RAISED POPS TO DEFINITE IN THE UPSLOPE AREA FROM            
IWD TO ROCKLAND. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SOMEWHERE               
AROUND 10 TO 1...DUE TO MAJORITY OF VERTICAL MOTION BELOW THE                   
DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH ZONE...WHICH WITH A BLEND OF NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW            
RUN/GFS FOR QPF RESULTS IN 1 TO 2 INCHES. THE AMOUNT OF COLD AIR                
CROSSING CENTRAL AND LAKE SUPERIOR IS A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN...                
WITH THE GFS SHOWING -8 TO PERHAPS -10C AT 00Z TUE...COMPARED TO THE            
NAM AND LOCAL WRF-ARW WHICH HAVE -4 TO -6C. EITHER SCENARIO SEEMS AT            
LEAST POSSIBLE FOR LAKE ENHANCED PCPN...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THERE             
WILL BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE AROUND IN THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD OF            
THE UPPER LOW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WARMER SCENARIO WOULD RESULT             
IN POTENTIAL FOR RAIN TO MIX IN...PARTICULARLY OVER LAKE SUPERIOR               
AND OVER LAND NEAR THE SUPERIOR SHORELINE. GIVEN 00Z SOUNDING FROM              
CWPL UPSTREAM WAS -6C...WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW. THE            
WARMER SCENARIO ALSO MEANS THAT ANY SNOW THAT FALLS INLAND WILL ALSO            
BE WETTER WITH SNOW TO WATER RATIOS LESS THAN 10 TO 1. COULD BE AN              
INCH...PERHAPS TWO OF THIS WET SNOW IN THE EASTERN CWA. THE CENTRAL             
U.P. LOOKS TO BE MAINLY DRY TODAY...WITH SOME SUN AS THE DRY-SLOT               
WORKS IN. A FEW -SHSN COULD WORK IN OVER MQT COUNTY OFF OF WRN                  
SUPERIOR IN THE AFTN...BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT FOR CENTRAL UPPER MI.               
ALTHOUGH COLD AIR IS FLOWING IN...EXPECT HIGHS AGAIN TODAY IN THE               
30S...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING NW WINDS AND NEAR LAKE             
SUPERIOR WITH HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER.                                   
TONIGHT...UPPER LOW MOVES SE INTO OHIO BY 12Z TUE...COMING CLOSE TO             
PHASING WITH THE SHRTWV CURRENTLY HEADING EAST OUT OF SRN IA. AS A              
RESULT...THE SFC LOWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN NW ONTARIO AND SE IA END            
UP MERGING TOGETHER INTO A DEEPER 1003 MB LOW NEAR LONDON ONTARIO AT            
12Z TUE. THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS TO STRENGTHEN NORTH TO NE WINDS                
OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. NORMALLY THIS WOULD SPELL COLDER AIR                
MOVING IN. HOWEVER...THE AIR COMING IN IS EITHER JUST AS COOL OR                
PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN THE AIR THAT IS IN OVER THE CWA AT            
00Z PER 850MB TEMP PROGS. THE REASON IS THAT THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS            
TO PULL WARMER AIR IN OFF THE ATLANTIC INTO ITS CIRCULATION. SO WITH            
LITTLE TO NO CHANGE IN 850MB TEMPS...LAKE ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE THE             
RULE...POSSIBLY PURE LAKE EFFECT IN THE WRN U.P.. PROBLEM IN THE WRN            
U.P. COMPARED TO TODAY IS THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER                  
LOW...INVERSIONS FALL WITH THE MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES. THE QUESTION             
IS IF THE -10C ISOTHERM DRIES OUT...WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE PCPN FROM            
SNOW TO FZDZ GIVEN THAT AN UPSLOPING WIND CONTINUES. RIGHT NOW ONLY             
OUR LOCAL WRF-ARW RUN SHOWS THIS OCCURRING...WHILE THE NAM/GFS SHOW             
THE -10C ISOTHERM REMAINING MOIST. THEREFORE HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP               
THE P-TYPE AS SNOW. IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST...INVERSIONS WILL                   
GRADUALLY LOWER AS WELL...BUT NOT AS QUICK. SO CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER             
THAT THE P-TYPE WILL STAY AS SNOW INLAND FROM LAKE SUPERIOR. AMOUNTS            
OF SNOW SHOULD NOT BE THAT IMPRESSIVE...MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO GIVEN              
LOW SNOW TO WATER RATIOS. REGARDING AREAS NEAR THE LAKE...THE WARMER            
NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW RUNS SUGGEST HOLDING ON TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX THROUGH            
AT LEAST 09Z. IF THE PCPN IS GENERALLY LIGHT...THEN MORE OF THE PCPN            
SHOULD FALL AS RAIN. GIVEN THE WARMER 850MB TEMPS AND PLENTY OF                 
CLOUDS...ALONG WITH A FLOW OF AIR OFF THE WARM LAKE SUPERIOR                    
WATER...TEMPS SHOULD NOT DROP TOO MUCH. COLDEST READINGS EXPECTED IN            
THE INTERIOR WEST...CLOSEST TO THE COLDEST 850MB AIR...BUT EVEN                 
THESE SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE MID 20S.                                            
TUESDAY...UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO SHIFT INTO NORTH CENTRAL PA BY 00Z            
WED...WITH THE SFC LOW MOVING TO THE LAKE ONTARIO AREA. THIS ALLOWS             
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BUILD INTO WESTERN UPPER MI BY 00Z...IN                
ADDITION TO CONTINUED MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES THROUGH THE DAY. THE               
RIDGE SHOULD BRING DRIER AIR IN...LIKELY TO THE WESTERN CWA...ENOUGH            
TO END PCPN BY EARLY AFTN. HOWEVER...THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CWA                
WILL STAY IN LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED UNDER THE LOWERING INVERSION...                 
ENHANCED BY LAKE SUPERIOR GIVEN COOL AIR BELOW THE INVERSION. PCPN              
TYPE IS VERY TRICKY...AS ALL MODELS SHOW THE -10C LAYER DRYING OUT              
THROUGH THE DAY. GIVEN A NORTH WIND OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR...SET            
UP IS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE. SO WITH LAKE ENHANCEMENT OFF LAKE                  
SUPERIOR AND UPSLOPE FLOW PRODUCING VERTICAL MOTION...SOME PCPN                 
SHOULD OCCUR OUT OF THE CLOUDS. RIGHT NOW HAVE GONE WITH EITHER SNOW            
SHOWERS OR DZ/FZDZ (FZDZ OVER INLAND AREAS THROUGH THE EARLY AFTN).             
POPS ARE HIGHEST IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL IN THE               
MORNING...THEN DECREASE IN THE AFTN AS THE DRIER AIR TRIES TO WORK              
IN. GIVEN CLOUD COVER AND 850MB TEMPS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN             
TODAY...HIGHS WILL ALSO END UP SLIGHTLY COOLER. STILL...MOST                    
LOCATIONS SHOULD BE IN THE 30S...WARMEST IN THE DOWNSLOPE AREAS OF              
THE SOUTH CENTRAL.                                                              
TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU...PER THE UKMET/NAM/GFS/ECMWF...UPPER MI LOOKS            
TO BE CAUGHT IN SQUEEZE-PLAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER CANADA             
AND THE NORTHERN U.S. BECOMES BLOCKED. THIS BLOCKING LOOKS TO BE A              
RESULT OF STRONG RIDGING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW TO OUR                 
EAST. IN FACT...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER LOW               
BACK TO THE NW DURING THIS PERIOD...BASICALLY PULLED BY THE CURRENT             
SHRTWV CROSSING SRN IA. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR UPPER MI IS A PERSISTENT            
CHANCE FOR -SN ACROSS THE EAST HALF OF UPPER MI CLOSER TO THE DEEPER            
MOISTURE AROUND THE UPPER LOW...WHILE THE WEST HALF OF UPPER MI IS              
DRY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LOW INVERSIONS              
AND THE SURFACE RIDGE. STILL MAINTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME                 
DZ/FZDZ OVER THE EASTERN CWA TUE NIGHT SINCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT            
THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE IN UNTIL WED. ANY PCPN LOOKS TO BE                
LIGHT AT THE CURRENT TIME DUE TO LACK OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WITH              
THE UPPER LOW. GIVEN THE BLOCKED PATTERN...NO SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR            
WARMING IS PLANNED. THEREFORE... LOWS AND HIGHS ARE FORECAST TO BE              
ABOUT THE SAME THROUGH THE PERIOD...IN THE 20S AND 30S RESPECTIVELY.            
BEYOND THU...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE. 00Z ECMWF/GFS/GFS                     
ENSEMBLES ARE ALL IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF             
A BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR FRI              
INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS TROUGH IS FORMED BY A COMBINATION OF THE                 
UPPER LOW TO OUR EAST ON THU AND ANOTHER TROUGH DROPPING DOWN OUT OF            
CENTRAL CANADA. THIS MEANS THAT GRADUAL COOLING WILL OCCUR...COLD               
ENOUGH TO SET UP PURE LAKE EFFECT BY THE WEEKEND.                               
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION (FOR THE 12Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
OVERALL...EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL AT KCMX/KSAW THRU THIS              
FCST PERIOD. WEDGE OF SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR SWEEPING INTO THE AREA                 
AHEAD OF MID/UPPER LOW DROPPING SE TOWARD THE UPPER MIDWEST MAY                 
RESULT IN CLOUDS SCATTERING OUT FOR A WHILE TODAY...BUT CONFIDENCE              
IS LOW IN DETERMINING A TIME PERIOD WHEN THAT MIGHT OCCUR.                      
OTHERWISE...UPPER LOW DROPPING INTO THE VCNTY WILL LIKELY BRING SOME            
-SHSN TO KCMX THIS AFTN AND KSAW THIS EVENING. SOME LAKE ENHANCEMENT            
IS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY AT KSAW AS CONVERGENT NRLY UPSLOPING FLOW              
DEVELOPS. MAY SEE IFR CONDITIONS FOR A TIME LATE EVENING INTO THE               
OVERNIGHT.                                                                      
&&                                                                              
.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A LOW PRES TROF EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN ONTARIO ACROSS THE UPPER                
GREAT LAKES TO THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL CONSOLIDATE                
INTO A LOW PRES CENTER OVER SRN LAKE HURON THIS EVENING. AS THIS                
OCCURS...NRLY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR THIS            
AFTN AND MORE SO THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. EXPECT NRLY WINDS IN               
THE 20-30KT RANGE TONIGHT WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF THE LAKE. IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS            
COULD OCCUR...BUT SINCE THERE IS A LACK OF COLD AIR ADVECTION TO                
INCREASE MIXING...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION OF GALES. PROGRESSION            
OF THE MAIN WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL SLOW TO A CRAWL TUE THRU FRI. WITH             
LOW PRES TO THE E AND HIGH PRES TO THE W...N TO NW WINDS WILL BE THE            
RULE TUE THRU FRI WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS REMAINING OVER THE E HALF            
OF LAKE SUPERIOR. OVERALL...AFTER TUE...WINDS SHOULD GENERALLY BE IN            
THE 15-25KT RANGE OVER THE E AND 10-20KT OVER THE W.

CLOUDS WILL RAPIDLY INCREASE EARLY THIS EVENING AS LOW PRESSURE                 
CONTINUES TO APPROACH. THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD WILL ARRIVE FROM WEST           
TO EAST...STARTING IN THE CT VALLEY SOMETIME BETWEEN 02Z AND                    
06Z...THEN SPREADING EASTWARD FROM THERE. THE DOMINANT PRECIPITATION            
TYPE WILL BE RAIN...ALTHOUGH A PORTION OF NW MASS AND SW NH MAY SEE A           
BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW AT THE START. NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.           
ATTM...THE THINKING IS THAT THE SFC TEMPS WILL WARM UP ENOUGH TO                
ALLOW FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF FREEZING RAIN IF ANY AT ALL. IT WOULD BE           
EXTREMELY ISOLATED AT BEST. WENT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS FOR ALL ZONES            
BY LATE AT NIGHT. TEMPS WILL SLOWLY RISE OVERNIGHT AS THE LOW LEVEL             
JET GETS GOING.                                                                 
RAIN WILL BECOME HEAVY AT TIMES TUESDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY THE                
WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA...BEFORE SHIFTING TO THE EASTERN HALF DURING            
THE AFTERNOON. CATEGORICAL POPS FOR ALL AREAS. BEST GUESS AT THIS               
TIME IS THAT A GENERAL .75 TO 1.5 INCHES OF RAIN WILL FALL...WITH               
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. THIS SHOULDN/T CAUSE WIDESPREAD FLOODING                
PROBLEMS. HOWEVER...WE/LL LIKELY SEE THE NORMAL MINOR URBAN/POOR                
DRAINAGE FLOODING AT TIMES. WENT WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF                        
THUNDER...MAINLY FOR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES...AS WEAK INSTABILITY           
MAY DEVELOP AS THE LLJ PUMPS NORTHWARD A DECENT PLUME OF THETA-E.               
THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR TUESDAY MAY BE THE WINDS...AS A 65 KNOT                 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET DEVELOPS. THIS MAY LEAD TO SPEEDS OF WIND               
ADVISORY CRITERIA IF NOT ISOLD MARGINAL HWW CRITERIA TUESDAY                    
AFTERNOON ALONG THE SOUTH COAST AND POSSIBLY THE REST OF EASTERN                
MASS. THE HIGHER TERRAIN MAY BE AFFECTED AS WELL. SUBSEQUENT SHIFTS             
MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER ADVISORIES/WATCHES/WARNINGS. ANY CONVECTION                
COULD BRING DOWN ISOLD STRONG WIND GUSTS AS WELL...ESPECIALLY IF SFC            
TEMPS REALLY WARM UP.                                                           
THERE MAY BE A 1-2 FOOT SURGE ON THE SOUTH COAST BAYS WITH THE STRONG           
SOUTHERLY LLJ....BUT TIDES ARE LOW AND PRESSURE FALLS NOT OVERLY                
IMPRESSIVE. THEREFORE...NO COASTAL FLOODING PROBLEMS ARE EXPECTED AT            
THIS TIME.                                                                      
MODEL MAX TEMPS FOR TUESDAY LOOKED TOO LOW. THESE SOUTHERLY LLJ                 
EVENTS ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCE HIGHER SURFACE TEMPS THAN WHAT MOS AND             
EVEN MODEL 2M TEMPS INDICATE. WENT FOR MID 50S ACROSS EASTERN MASS/RI           
AND PORTIONS OF CT. COOLER TEMPS /40S - LOW 50S/ WILL BE FOUND ACROSS           
THE INTERIOR ALTHOUGH IT/S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL NEED TO BE             
RAISED AS WELL.                                                                 
OCCLUSION WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION EARLY TUE EVENING.  NAM              
IS THE SLOWEST MOVING THE OCCLUSION THROUGH AND BRINGS A SLUG OF                
HEAVY RAIN TO E MA INTO SE NH AT THE NOSE OF A PERSISTENT SELY LLJ.             
CONSENSUS AMONG OTHER MODELS INCLUDING GFS FAVORS A FASTER SOLUTION             
SO WE LEANED TOWARD GFS WHICH LIFTS THE HEAVIER RAFL NORTH AND EAST             
OF SNE BY TUE EVENING.  HOWEVER...SOME RAIN WILL LIKELY LINGER                  
ACROSS NE ZONES NEAR THE NOSE OF THE LLJ SO WE WILL HAVE LIKELY TO              
CATEGORICAL POPS TUE EVENING FROM SW NH THROUGH E MA WITH LOWER POPS            
FURTHER SW AS DRY SLOT MOVES IN.  ALSO...GFS INSTABILITY PARAMETERS             
SUGGEST ISOLD ELEVATED THUNDER POSSIBLE E MA THROUGH SE NH.                     
TREND TUE NIGHT WILL BE FOR DECREASING POPS AS THE DRY SLOT MOVES               
THROUGH. WIND MAY STILL BE A CONCERN TUE EVENING FROM CAPE COD                  
THROUGH CAPE ANN WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE LLJ AND WILL HAVE                 
HIGHER GUSTS IN THIS REGION. COLDER AIR WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE IN TUE             
NIGHT AS UPPER LOW REMAINS TO THE NW WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT. MIN             
TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM UPPER 20S FAR NW TO MID/UPPER 30S COASTAL                 
PLAIN.

THE DRY SLOT WILL HAVE WRAPPED INTO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND BY EARLY               
WEDNESDAY MORNING.  WE EXPECT PARTLY SUNNY SKIES IN THE                         
MORNING...BUT STEEP LAPSE RATES WITH THE COLD AIR ALOFT SHOULD                  
RESULT IN LOTS OF DIURNAL CUMULUS DEVELOPING BY AFTERNOON AND                   
GENERALLY MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.  THE UPPER LEVEL LOW LOOKS TO REMAIN             
WELL TO OUR NORTHWEST...SO WE EXPECT MAINLY A DRY DAY.                          
HOWEVER...WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A BRIEF PASSING                 
SHOWER/SPRINKLE IN THE AFTERNOON.  IT COULD BE IN THE FORM OF A WET SNOW        
SHOWER/FLURRY IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN...BUT NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED             
WITH TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING.  HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD MAINLY              
BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S...WITH READINGS A BIT COOLER IN THE                  
HIGHER TERRAIN.

AN ISOLATED SHOWER/SPRINKLE WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE EARLY

THE NIGHT.  THEREFORE...WE LEANED TOWARDS THE WARMER MET GUIDANCE               
WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUDS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.  LOWS SHOULD MAINLY            
BE IN THE UPPER 20S AND LOWER 30S ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A BIT WARMER              
IN THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND OF BOSTON.

SHOULD SEE PARTIAL SUNSHINE...BUT ANOTHER DAY OF DIURNAL AFTERNOON              
CUMULUS EXPECTED...PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE INTERIOR WITH A POCKET OF            
COLD AIR ALOFT.  WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR PERHAPS A                 
BRIEF INSTABILITY PASSING RAIN/SNOW SHOWER ACROSS THE DISTANT                   
INTERIOR...BUT CAN NOT SEE MUCH MORE THAN THAT.  HIGHS WILL MAINLY              
BE IN THE 40S.

CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE DURING THE DAY FRIDAY OUT AHEAD OF THE NEXT              
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.  THE GFS/CANADIAN HAVE PRECIPITATION OVER                  
SPREADING MOST OF THE REGION LATE FRIDAY NIGHT...WHILE THE GFS                  
ENSEMBLES ARE A BIT SLOWER AND HAVE THE BULK OF THE ACTION SATURDAY

THE TIMING SO WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY              
NIGHT.  BASED ON THE EXPECTED TRACK OF THE SYSTEM...WE EXPECT MAINLY            
RAIN FROM THIS SYSTEM.  HOWEVER...CAN NOT RULE OUT A BRIEF PERIOD OF            
SNOW OR ICE ACROSS THE DISTANT INTERIOR AT THE ONSET.  THE ECMWF                
SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF AN OUTLIER DEVELOPING THE WAVE FURTHER EAST AND            
HAS LITTLE IF ANY PRECIPITATION FROM THIS SYSTEM.  WHILE WE DO NOT              
EXPECT A LOT OF PRECIPITATION WITH THIS SYSTEM...WOULD FAVOR MOST OF

BASED ON THE LATEST MODELS DRY AND CHILLY WEATHER WILL WORK BACK                
INTO THE REGION ON SUNDAY.  THE GFS IS DRY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY                 
NIGHT BUT ITS ENSEMBLES AND THE 12Z ECMWF INDICATE THE THREAT OF                
MORE PRECIPITATION SOMETIME MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT.  LOW CONFIDENCE             
THIS FAR OUT...BUT THIS SYSTEM MAY BRING SOME WINTRY WEATHER TO

.SYNOPSIS...                                                                    
19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS SHOWING A NOW HIGHLY AMPLIFIED              
UPPER LEVEL PATTERN ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. MAIN FEATURE OF NOTE IS               
A SHARP MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NOW PUSHING EAST OF THE MS VALLEY.               
INITIAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY IS DROPPING INTO THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY                
AND REMAINS WELL DEFINED ON WV IMAGERY WITH MARKED DRYING IN ITS                
WAKE EXPANDING ACROSS THE ARKLATEX REGION. ANOTHER STRONG PIECE OF              
UPPER LEVEL ENERGY IS DIVING SOUTH OUT OF WESTERN ONTARIO INTO THE              
GREAT LAKES. THESE TWO FEATURES WILL CONSOLIDATE OVER THE NEXT 12-18            
HOURS INTO AN ENERGETIC UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE OVER THE GREAT LAKES            
AND SOUTHWARD TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS TROUGH            
WE FIND LONGWAVE RIDGING OVER THE INTER-MOUNTAIN WEST AND ALONG THE             
EAST COAST. SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE FEED IS ALSO SEEN MOVING                   
NORTHEAST ACROSS MEXICO AND TOWARD THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.                     
LARGE SCALE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH MID-LEVEL HEIGHT FALLS IS COMBINING            
WITH THIS UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE AND VIGOROUS WWA IN THE LOWER LEVELS             
TO PRODUCE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM LA TO THE TN AND             
OHIO VALLEYS. THIS MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORM WILL BE                       
APPROACHING OUR WESTERN ZONES OF SOUTHEAST AL AND THE FLORIDA                   
PANHANDLE DURING THE EARLY AND MIDDLE EVENING HOURS.                            
IN THE LOWER LEVELS...SURFACE RIDGING THAT HAS BEEN IN CONTROL OF               
THE REGION IS WEAKENING AND RAPIDLY MOVING SOUTH AND EAST LATE THIS             
AFTERNOON IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM TO OUR NORTHWEST AND             
ASSOCIATED APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED            
FROM THE OHIO VALLEY SOUTHWARD INTO THE CENTRAL TENNESSEE VALLEY AND            
THEN SOUTHWEST TO LA. A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA INTO              
THE EARLY EVENING BEFORE THE MAIN BAND OF CLOUDS AND SHOWERS                    
OVERSPREADS FROM THE WEST.                                                      
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...                                
THERE REMAINS VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG THE MODEL SUITES AS TO THE              
EVOLUTION OF THE APPROACHING FRONT AND THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS FROM            
THIS EVENING INTO TUESDAY MORNING. 850MB THETA-E RIDGE AND                      
ASSOCIATED FORCED ASCENT WILL BE ARRIVING ACROSS THE FLORIDA                    
PANHANDLE AND SOUTHEAST ALABAMA EARLY THIS EVENING. ALTHOUGH A                  
STRAY SHOWER OR SPRINKLE IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE OVER THIS AREA DURING            
THE REMAINING AFTERNOON HOURS...THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF            
UNTIL AROUND SUNSET AND THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. SURFACE                      
INSTABILITY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED WITH SREF PROBS OF EVEN 500 J/KG               
HOLDING BELOW 5% OVER LAND. HOWEVER...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE               
THAT WE WILL INITIALLY SEE SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY ALOFT OVER THE             
WESTERN ZONES AS SHOWALTER INDICES APPROACH ZERO. WITH THIS IN MIND             
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO GET A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER WITH THE BAND            
OF SHOWERS.                                                                     
COLD FRONT IS THEN EXPECTED TO STEADILY PUSH SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE               
AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT AND EXIT THE SOUTHEAST BIG BEND NEAR OR                  
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE. INITIAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY IS PROGGED TO SHEAR             
OUT RAPIDLY TO THE NORTHEAST AS THE MAIN UPPER LOW ORGANIZES WELL TO            
THE NORTH. AS THIS OCCURS THE LARGE SCALE LIFT OVERHEAD ALL BUT                 
COLLAPSES. MOISTURE AXIS BECOMES RATHER STRUNG OUT INTO THE EASTERN             
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL. WITH ALL THIS IN MIND SHOULD                 
EXPECT A RATHER SOLID LINE OF RAIN/EMBEDDED STORMS OVER THE WEST                
THIS EVENING TO WEAKEN AND THIN OUT AS IT MOVES EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT.            
CURRENT FORECAST POPS SHOWING LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL VALUES OVER THE             
EASTERN FL PANHANDLE/SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST                
GEORGIA THIS EVENING. THESE POPS TAPER TO ONLY LOW END CHANCE                   
VALUES AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN ZONES APPROACHING THE              
SUWANNEE RIVER VALLEY. SHOWALTER INDICES SHOW A LESSENING OF THE                
ELEVATED INSTABILITY INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES AND WILL NOT BRING                  
THUNDER MENTION EAST OF THE APALACHICOLA RIVER. THIS IS SHAPING UP              
TO BE A HIGH POP/LOW IMPACT EVENT...MEANING THAT ALTHOUGH MANY                  
LOCATIONS WILL SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF RAINFALL TONIGHT...THE DURATION            
IS LIKELY TO BE SHORT AND RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS GENERALLY ON THE               
LIGHT SIDE. IN FACT...AS THE OVERALL DYNAMICS CONTINUE TO COLLAPSE              
DURING THE LATE NIGHT HOURS...FAR EASTERN AREA FROM VALDOSTA INTO               
THE EASTERN FLORIDA BIG BEND MAY ONLY SEE A QUICK LINE OF BROKEN                
SHOWERS PASS THROUGH WITH VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION.               
ANY LINGERING SHOWERS SHOULD EXIT THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA BIG BEND                
AROUND SUNRISE TOMORROW WITH CLOUDS RAPIDLY DECREASING                          
THROUGH THE MORNING. EXPECTING A PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY AFTERNOON               
ALMOST REGION-WIDE WITH A GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHWEST WIND AND HIGH                
TEMPS WARMING FROM EARLY MORNING LOWS IN THE 40S UP INTO THE 60S.               
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVERHEAD TUESDAY NIGHT AND REMAINS IN THE                  
VICINITY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH THE HIGH SETTLING OVERHEAD               
AND WITH VERY DRY LOW LEVEL AIR IN PLACE...EXPECTING A GOOD                     
RADIATIONAL COOLING EVENT RESULTING IN YET ANOTHER COLD MORNING.                
ASSUMING SURFACE WINDS CAN DROP TO CALM (WHICH APPEARS QUITE LIKELY             
WITH THE FORECAST HIGH POSITION) MANY NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS                 
UNDER RADIATIONAL COOLING LOOK TO BOTTOM OUT WITHIN A FEW DEGREES               
EITHER SIDE OF FREEZING EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. HAVE ADDED PATCHY              
FROST TO ALL AREAS AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE COAST DURING THIS TIME AS            
FROST CAN TAKE HOLD AT GROUND LEVEL EVEN WITH 2 METER TEMPS HOLDING             
IN THE MIDDLE 30S. A PLEASANT FALL DAY EXPECTED FOR WEDNESDAY WITH              
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. MAY SEE SOME INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL                         
CIRRUS...ESPECIALLY LATE...TO FILTER THE SUN AS GFS/ECMWF SHOWING A             
WEAK DISTURBANCE APPROACHING IN THE FAST UPPER LEVEL FLOW. HIGHS                
GENERALLY IN THE MIDDLE 60S. WITH THE SURFACE RIDGE STILL IN                    
PROXIMITY WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAY ONCE AGAIN SEE A FEW AREAS APPROACH               
FREEZING LATE. BEST CHANCES WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO SEE FROST WILL BE                
ACROSS THE EASTERN FORECAST AREA...AND ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SANDIER            
SOILS OF THE BIG BEND. THIS IS A LOWER CONFIDENCE FORECAST THAN ON              
TUESDAY NIGHT AS ANY CIRRUS POSSIBLY STILL OVERHEAD WOULD BE ENOUGH             
TO DISRUPT THE RADIATIONAL COOLING PROCESS AND KEEP TEMPS UP A FEW              
EXTRA DEGREES.                                                                  
.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY).                                         
CONTINUED AMPLIFIED AND FAST MOVING PATTERN ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS            
IS STILL INDICATED THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM PERIOD. SURFACE HIGH                
PRESSURE AND FLAT FLOW ALOFT WILL CREATE A PLEASANT THANKSGIVING                
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST BEFORE AN APPROACHING WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE                 
ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF COAST STATES BEGINS TO SPREAD EASTWARD                  
FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THIS SOLUTION HAS BEEN GAINING SUPPORT BETWEEN THE            
GFS AND EURO...AND THE LATEST RUNS OF THESE MODELS CONTINUE TO                  
SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM. IT APPEARS THAT A DEEPENING               
SHORT WAVE (ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF MANY) DROPPING OUT OF THE GREAT              
LAKES STATES ON FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING WILL HELP PULL THE                
SURFACE WAVE NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE APPALACHIAN FOOTHILLS AND UP THE            
EAST COAST THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THIS WILL RESULT IN A COLD               
FRONT PUSHING INTO OUR REGION SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH GOOD CHANCES              
OF RAIN EXPECTED. THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM HAS DECENT CONSISTENCY              
BETWEEN THE OPERATIONAL GFS AND EURO...AS WELL AS MANY OF THE GFS               
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOW QUICKLY                
THIS SYSTEM WILL GET THROUGH THE REGION. HOWEVER...IF THE FRONTAL               
SYSTEM HOLDS UP OVER OR JUST SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA...IT WON`T              
REMAIN THERE FOR LONG AS THE OVERALL EAST COAST TROF DEEPENS MORE               
AND ANOTHER PIECE OF ENERGY SHOULD CLEAR OUR REGION OUT BY THE FIRST            
OF THE WEEK.                                                                    
MAX TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE FIRST PART OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD              
SHOULD GENERALLY BE AT OR JUST ABOVE CLIMO. A COOL DOWN BEHIND THE              
FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT PASSES EARLY SUNDAY MORNING WILL DROP MAX TEMPS             
BACK INTO THE LOWER 60S BY MONDAY. MIN TEMPS...ASIDE FROM A LIGHT               
FREEZE ON THURSDAY MORNING WILL WARM EACH DAY THROUGH SUNDAY...AND              
BE ABOVE NORMAL THESE LAST TWO DAYS. COOLER MINS RETURN BEHIND THE              
FRONT BY MONDAY MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS AND SLIDES SOUTHEAST THIS EVENING ALLOWING                
WINDS TO COME AROUND TO SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. COLD FRONT WILL CROSS              
THE WATERS FROM WEST TO EAST LATE THIS EVENING INTO THE EARLY                   
MORNING HOURS WITH A SHARP WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH.              
WINDS WILL INCREASE IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT TO CAUTIONARY LEVELS. A            
BRIEF PERIOD OF ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS IS POSSIBLE INTO TUESDAY                   
MORNING...ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN LEGS AND THIS POTENTIAL WILL              
NEED TO BE MONITORED THIS EVENING. NORTHERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN                   
ELEVATED NEAR CAUTIONARY LEVELS INTO TUESDAY EVENING. WINDS WILL                
THEN RAPIDLY DIMINISH INTO THE DAYLIGHT HOURS OF WEDNESDAY AS                   
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THIS            
HIGH WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE FORECAST WATERS PROVIDING LIGHT              
WINDS AND SEAS THROUGH THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM BEGINS TO                
APPROACH FROM THE WEST FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

VFR CIGS (AROUND 9K FT) WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF AN

CIGS OR VIS...BUT BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE             
IN ISOLATED +SHRA. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO NORTHWEST BEHIND THE COLD                
FRONT DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...FOLLOWED BY DECREASING                   
CLOUDS. NORTHWEST WINDS OF 10 KT (GUSTS TO 20 KT) ARE EXPECTED BY

.UPDATE...                                                                      
UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO DROP SOUTHEASTWARD OUT OF WESTERN ONTARIO                
TOWARDS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR THIS MORNING. EVENTUALLY UPPER LOW                
WILL MERGE WITH S/WV OVER SOUTHERN LAKE MI FORMING BROADER UPPER LOW            
OVER SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES. WEAK SFC LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN                 
LOWER MI WILL MOVE SLOWLY EWD TO SOUTHERN LAKE HURON BY THE END OF              
THE DAY.  BACK EDGE OF LIGHT SNOW FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE                   
FEATURES HAS MOVED INTO LAKE MI.  BEST CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW THIS               
AFTERNOON WILL BE EAST OF A MANISTIQUE TO NEWBERRY LINE AND EVEN                
THERE AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT. AS MAIN UPPER LOW DROPS SOUTHEASTWARD            
ACROSS FAR WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR EXPECT FLURRIES/-SHSN TO ACCOMPANY             
IT. WITH A SLIGHTLY WESTWARD UPPER LOW TRACK EXPECT BEST CHANCE OF              
THIS ACTIVITY ACROSS WESTERN UPPER MICHIGAN WITH CENTRAL AREAS                  
REMAINING PRECIP FREE THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. 85H TEMPS WILL FALL              
INTO THE -8 TO -10 RANGE OVER WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR AND AS WINDS                
BECOME MORE NORTHWESTERLY DO EXPECT SOME LAKE ENHANCEMENT TO OCCUR              
IN FAVORABLE UPSLOPE AREAS IN THE WEST. STILL NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING            
MORE THAN AN INCH OR AT MOST 2 OF ACCUMULATION DURING THE DAY TODAY.            
OVERALL TEMP FORECAST IS ON TRACK AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS             
TO IT.                                                                          
.SYNOPSIS... ISSUED AT 425 AM EST                                               
08Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED RIDGING               
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. INTO SW CANADA...RIDGING IN THE OHIO VALLEY               
INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES...AND A TROUGH FROM MANITOBA SOUTHWARD             
INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. WITHIN THE TROUGH...AN UPPER LOW IS LOCATED            
AT THE FAR NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG. THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD             
OF THE UPPER LOW EXTENDS FROM MO ACROSS UPPER MI AND INTO NE                    
ONTARIO. SOME -SN IS FALLING OUT OF THE CONVEYOR BELT OVER THE                  
CENTRAL PORTION OF THE CWA...ALSO IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE BETTER                
MOISTURE IS BASED ON 00Z RAOBS FROM MPX...COMPARED TO GRB AND APX               
WHICH REFLECT THE DRIER AIRMASS OVER EASTERN UPPER MI. A DRY SLOT IS            
EVIDENT ON 11-3.9 U IMAGERY OVER NE MN...BUT FARTHER NW OVER NW MN              
INTO MANITOBA IS THE COLD CONVEYOR BELT (CCB) CLOUDS ON THE BACK                
SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW. 850MB TEMPS UNDER THE CCB WERE AROUND -14C               
BASED ON THE 00Z SOUNDING FROM CYQD...QUITE A BIT COLDER THAN THE               
-1C AT MPX...-4C AT INL AND -6C AT CWPL. TO THE SW OF UPPER MI ON               
WATER VAPOR...A SHRTWV IS MOVING THROUGH SRN IA. ASSOCIATED WITH THE            
SHRTWV IS A 1015MB SFC LOW IN SE IA. A TROUGH EXTENDS NE FROM THE               
LOW ACROSS CENTRAL UPPER MI...THEN HEADS BACK TO THE NW AS A COLD               
FRONT WHERE IT CONNECTS UP TO A 1008MB LOW IN FAR NW ONTARIO.                   
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION... ISSUED AT 425 AM EST                                             
MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS ARE THE AMOUNT OF SNOW THE NEXT TWO DAYS...              
ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE.                                      
TODAY...UPPER LOW AT THE NORTH END OF LAKE WINNIPEG IS PROGGED TO               
SLIDE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER WEST COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS 00Z                      
RUNS...MOVING INTO WRN WI AT 00Z TUE. THE BULK OF THE COLD AIR SEEN             
UPSTREAM AT CYQD WILL STAY UNDER OR TO THE WEST OF THE UPPER LOW.               
HOWEVER...SOME COOLING IS STILL EXPECTED TO COME INTO UPPER MICHIGAN            
WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW. NAM/GFS SHOW 850MB TEMPS FALLING            
TO -8 TO -10C OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR...WHICH WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH               
FOR LAKE ENHANCED OR PERHAPS EVEN PURE LAKE EFFECT. WITH NW WINDS...            
IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY FOR SNOW IN WRN UPPER MI...ESPECIALLY IN                   
UPSLOPE AREAS. HAVE RAISED POPS TO DEFINITE IN THE UPSLOPE AREA FROM            
IWD TO ROCKLAND. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SNOW TO WATER RATIOS SOMEWHERE               
AROUND 10 TO 1...DUE TO MAJORITY OF VERTICAL MOTION BELOW THE                   
DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH ZONE...WHICH WITH A BLEND OF NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW            
RUN/GFS FOR QPF RESULTS IN 1 TO 2 INCHES. THE AMOUNT OF COLD AIR                
CROSSING CENTRAL AND LAKE SUPERIOR IS A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN...                
WITH THE GFS SHOWING -8 TO PERHAPS -10C AT 00Z TUE...COMPARED TO THE            
NAM AND LOCAL WRF-ARW WHICH HAVE -4 TO -6C. EITHER SCENARIO SEEMS AT            
LEAST POSSIBLE FOR LAKE ENHANCED PCPN...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THERE             
WILL BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE AROUND IN THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT AHEAD OF            
THE UPPER LOW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WARMER SCENARIO WOULD RESULT             
IN POTENTIAL FOR RAIN TO MIX IN...PARTICULARLY OVER LAKE SUPERIOR               
AND OVER LAND NEAR THE SUPERIOR SHORELINE. GIVEN 00Z SOUNDING FROM              
CWPL UPSTREAM WAS -6C...WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW. THE            
WARMER SCENARIO ALSO MEANS THAT ANY SNOW THAT FALLS INLAND WILL ALSO            
BE WETTER WITH SNOW TO WATER RATIOS LESS THAN 10 TO 1. COULD BE AN              
INCH...PERHAPS TWO OF THIS WET SNOW IN THE EASTERN CWA. THE CENTRAL             
U.P. LOOKS TO BE MAINLY DRY TODAY...WITH SOME SUN AS THE DRY-SLOT               
WORKS IN. A FEW -SHSN COULD WORK IN OVER MQT COUNTY OFF OF WRN                  
SUPERIOR IN THE AFTN...BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT FOR CENTRAL UPPER MI.               
ALTHOUGH COLD AIR IS FLOWING IN...EXPECT HIGHS AGAIN TODAY IN THE               
30S...WARMEST SOUTH CENTRAL WITH DOWNSLOPING NW WINDS AND NEAR LAKE             
SUPERIOR WITH HEAT FLUX OFF THE WARMER WATER.                                   
TONIGHT...UPPER LOW MOVES SE INTO OHIO BY 12Z TUE...COMING CLOSE TO             
PHASING WITH THE SHRTWV CURRENTLY HEADING EAST OUT OF SRN IA. AS A              
RESULT...THE SFC LOWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN NW ONTARIO AND SE IA END            
UP MERGING TOGETHER INTO A DEEPER 1003 MB LOW NEAR LONDON ONTARIO AT            
12Z TUE. THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS TO STRENGTHEN NORTH TO NE WINDS                
OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR. NORMALLY THIS WOULD SPELL COLDER AIR                
MOVING IN. HOWEVER...THE AIR COMING IN IS EITHER JUST AS COOL OR                
PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN THE AIR THAT IS IN OVER THE CWA AT            
00Z PER 850MB TEMP PROGS. THE REASON IS THAT THE DEEPENING LOW HELPS            
TO PULL WARMER AIR IN OFF THE ATLANTIC INTO ITS CIRCULATION. SO WITH            
LITTLE TO NO CHANGE IN 850MB TEMPS...LAKE ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE THE             
RULE...POSSIBLY PURE LAKE EFFECT IN THE WRN U.P.. PROBLEM IN THE WRN            
U.P. COMPARED TO TODAY IS THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER                  
LOW...INVERSIONS FALL WITH THE MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES. THE QUESTION             
IS IF THE -10C ISOTHERM DRIES OUT...WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE PCPN FROM            
SNOW TO FZDZ GIVEN THAT AN UPSLOPING WIND CONTINUES. RIGHT NOW ONLY             
OUR LOCAL WRF-ARW RUN SHOWS THIS OCCURRING...WHILE THE NAM/GFS SHOW             
THE -10C ISOTHERM REMAINING MOIST. THEREFORE HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP               
THE P-TYPE AS SNOW. IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST...INVERSIONS WILL                   
GRADUALLY LOWER AS WELL...BUT NOT AS QUICK. SO CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER             
THAT THE P-TYPE WILL STAY AS SNOW INLAND FROM LAKE SUPERIOR. AMOUNTS            
OF SNOW SHOULD NOT BE THAT IMPRESSIVE...MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO GIVEN              
LOW SNOW TO WATER RATIOS. REGARDING AREAS NEAR THE LAKE...THE WARMER            
NAM/LOCAL WRF-ARW RUNS SUGGEST HOLDING ON TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX THROUGH            
AT LEAST 09Z. IF THE PCPN IS GENERALLY LIGHT...THEN MORE OF THE PCPN            
SHOULD FALL AS RAIN. GIVEN THE WARMER 850MB TEMPS AND PLENTY OF                 
CLOUDS...ALONG WITH A FLOW OF AIR OFF THE WARM LAKE SUPERIOR                    
WATER...TEMPS SHOULD NOT DROP TOO MUCH. COLDEST READINGS EXPECTED IN            
THE INTERIOR WEST...CLOSEST TO THE COLDEST 850MB AIR...BUT EVEN                 
THESE SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE MID 20S.                                            
TUESDAY...UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO SHIFT INTO NORTH CENTRAL PA BY 00Z            
WED...WITH THE SFC LOW MOVING TO THE LAKE ONTARIO AREA. THIS ALLOWS             
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BUILD INTO WESTERN UPPER MI BY 00Z...IN                
ADDITION TO CONTINUED MID-LEVEL HEIGHT RISES THROUGH THE DAY. THE               
RIDGE SHOULD BRING DRIER AIR IN...LIKELY TO THE WESTERN CWA...ENOUGH            
TO END PCPN BY EARLY AFTN. HOWEVER...THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CWA                
WILL STAY IN LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED UNDER THE LOWERING INVERSION...                 
ENHANCED BY LAKE SUPERIOR GIVEN COOL AIR BELOW THE INVERSION. PCPN              
TYPE IS VERY TRICKY...AS ALL MODELS SHOW THE -10C LAYER DRYING OUT              
THROUGH THE DAY. GIVEN A NORTH WIND OVER EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR...SET            
UP IS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE. SO WITH LAKE ENHANCEMENT OFF LAKE                  
SUPERIOR AND UPSLOPE FLOW PRODUCING VERTICAL MOTION...SOME PCPN                 
SHOULD OCCUR OUT OF THE CLOUDS. RIGHT NOW HAVE GONE WITH EITHER SNOW            
SHOWERS OR DZ/FZDZ (FZDZ OVER INLAND AREAS THROUGH THE EARLY AFTN).             
POPS ARE HIGHEST IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL IN THE               
MORNING...THEN DECREASE IN THE AFTN AS THE DRIER AIR TRIES TO WORK              
IN. GIVEN CLOUD COVER AND 850MB TEMPS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN             
TODAY...HIGHS WILL ALSO END UP SLIGHTLY COOLER. STILL...MOST                    
LOCATIONS SHOULD BE IN THE 30S...WARMEST IN THE DOWNSLOPE AREAS OF              
THE SOUTH CENTRAL.                                                              
TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU...PER THE UKMET/NAM/GFS/ECMWF...UPPER MI LOOKS            
TO BE CAUGHT IN SQUEEZE-PLAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER CANADA             
AND THE NORTHERN U.S. BECOMES BLOCKED. THIS BLOCKING LOOKS TO BE A              
RESULT OF STRONG RIDGING BUILT UP AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW TO OUR                 
EAST. IN FACT...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING THE UPPER LOW               
BACK TO THE NW DURING THIS PERIOD...BASICALLY PULLED BY THE CURRENT             
SHRTWV CROSSING SRN IA. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR UPPER MI IS A PERSISTENT            
CHANCE FOR -SN ACROSS THE EAST HALF OF UPPER MI CLOSER TO THE DEEPER            
MOISTURE AROUND THE UPPER LOW...WHILE THE WEST HALF OF UPPER MI IS              
DRY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LOW INVERSIONS              
AND THE SURFACE RIDGE. STILL MAINTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME                 
DZ/FZDZ OVER THE EASTERN CWA TUE NIGHT SINCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT            
THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE IN UNTIL WED. ANY PCPN LOOKS TO BE                
LIGHT AT THE CURRENT TIME DUE TO LACK OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WITH              
THE UPPER LOW. GIVEN THE BLOCKED PATTERN...NO SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR            
WARMING IS PLANNED. THEREFORE... LOWS AND HIGHS ARE FORECAST TO BE              
ABOUT THE SAME THROUGH THE PERIOD...IN THE 20S AND 30S RESPECTIVELY.            
BEYOND THU...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE. 00Z ECMWF/GFS/GFS                     
ENSEMBLES ARE ALL IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF             
A BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR FRI              
INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS TROUGH IS FORMED BY A COMBINATION OF THE                 
UPPER LOW TO OUR EAST ON THU AND ANOTHER TROUGH DROPPING DOWN OUT OF            
CENTRAL CANADA. THIS MEANS THAT GRADUAL COOLING WILL OCCUR...COLD               
ENOUGH TO SET UP PURE LAKE EFFECT BY THE WEEKEND.                               
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION (FOR THE 18Z TAF ISSUANCE)...                                         
OVERALL...EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL AT KCMX/KSAW THRU THIS              
FCST PERIOD. UPPER LOW DROPPING ACROSS WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR WILL               
BRING SOME -SHSN TO KCMX THIS AFTN AND KSAW THIS EVENING. SOME LAKE             
ENHANCEMENT IS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY AT KSAW AS CONVERGENT NRLY                 
UPSLOPING FLOW DEVELOPS. MAY SEE IFR CONDITIONS FOR A TIME LATE                 
EVENING INTO THE OVERNIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER                    
INVERSION WILL KEEP MVFR CIGS AT BOTH KCMX AND KSAW THROUGH 18Z                 
TUESDAY.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 AM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A LOW PRES TROF EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN ONTARIO ACROSS THE UPPER                
GREAT LAKES TO THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL CONSOLIDATE                
INTO A LOW PRES CENTER OVER SRN LAKE HURON THIS EVENING. AS THIS                
OCCURS...NRLY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR THIS            
AFTN AND MORE SO THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. EXPECT NRLY WINDS IN               
THE 20-30KT RANGE TONIGHT WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF THE LAKE. IT`S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME GALE FORCE GUSTS            
COULD OCCUR...BUT SINCE THERE IS A LACK OF COLD AIR ADVECTION TO                
INCREASE MIXING...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION OF GALES. PROGRESSION            
OF THE MAIN WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL SLOW TO A CRAWL TUE THRU FRI. WITH             
LOW PRES TO THE E AND HIGH PRES TO THE W...N TO NW WINDS WILL BE THE            
RULE TUE THRU FRI WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS REMAINING OVER THE E HALF            
OF LAKE SUPERIOR. OVERALL...AFTER TUE...WINDS SHOULD GENERALLY BE IN            
THE 15-25KT RANGE OVER THE E AND 10-20KT OVER THE W.

WHICH WAS THE "WINTER OF THE WARM LAYER ALOFT" FOR MUCH OF CENTRAL              
PA... DIFFICULT TO FIND A WARM LAYER ALOFT WITH THIS SYSTEM.                    
A MESSY EVENING COMMUTE IS AHEAD FOR MUCH OF CENTRAL AND ALL OF

THIS IS OFTEN THE CASE AS THE AMPLIFIED NATURE OF THE LW TROF                   
LEADS TO A SLOWER EWD FNTL PROGRESSION.                                         
THE ANOMALOUS H5 LOW IS FCST TO ESSENTIALLY MOVE OVERHEAD ON                    
TUE...ACCOMPANIED BY VERY COLD TEMPS ALOFT AND STEEP MID LVL LAPSE
