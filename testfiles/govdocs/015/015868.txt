HotSpot Notes -- September 23, 1999

Mid-Summer 1999:

NOAA satellite data indicated "HotSpots" surrounding North Andros Island in the Bahamas since
July 27, expanding to South Andros Island through July 31.  In early August, South Florida and
the Straits, the eastern Bahamas and the north coast of Cuba showed 1degree C HotSpots,
creating conditions conducive to coral bleaching.  HotSpots were maintained between August 9-
28 in these areas, with the remainder of the eastern Caribbean starting to warm up.

Late Summer 1999:

In early September, the south-western corner of Puerto Rico exhibited 1 degree C HotSpots,
followed by warming along eastern Hispaniola and the Lesser Antilles (Leeward and Windward
Islands). By September 14, eastern Nicaragua, along with the north coast of Venezuela, the
Netherlands Antilles, and Trinidad and Tobago had 1 degree HotSpots, with patchy HotSpots off
the coast of Belize. HotSpots dissipated around September 18 from the Bahamas and northern
Cuba but remained on the south side of Cuba, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, with patchy HotSpots
along the Nicaraguan coast.  By September 21, the entire lower Caribbean showed 1 degree C
HotsSpot anomalies. 

Our new Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) maps, depicting accumulated heat stress for the last 90
days  (http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/PSB/EPS/icg/dhw/dhw_new.html) indicate 1-3 DWH
throughout the Caribbean, show concentrations of 4-8 DHW surrounding Andros Island
(Bahamas) and the south-west Florida Keys, and 4-5 DHW along the lesser Antilles (Windward
Islands).
