   ARCINFO geography and the ArcView project files.



 I. Coral Reefs



    A. Patch Reefs



        Discrete coral communities, typically dome-shaped,

        usually outside of Hawk Channel, with a few inshore. Can be

        linear features where several or a series occurs. Mostly

        off Key Largo and Elliot Key (5,000) with a few off Big

        Pine, near Key West, and at the Dry Tortugas. Usually

        composed of hard corals Montastraea sp., Siderastrea sp.,

        Diploria sp., and Colpophyllia sp.. Often surrounded by a

        whitish appearing halo.



        1. Individual Patch (CPI)



            Isolated, barely visible on aerial photography, with

            or without a halo.



        2. Aggregated patch reefs (CPA)



            More than one, usually too close together to map individually

            or where halos coalesce.



        3. Halo (CPH)



            Barren, essentially unvegetated, variable, whitish zone around

            patch reef resulting from grazing activity of urchins and

            fishes. Rubble from weathering of patch reef may allow

            attachment sites for corals to expand the colony. Not always

            present or large enough to be mapped.



        4. Individual Patch Reef and Halo (CPIH)



            Patch reef and halo combination too small to delineate directly

            on aerial photography. Delineations of reef and halo performed

            during compilation.



    B. Platform Margin Reef



        Generally, the "reef tract" or "barrier reef." Extends from

        northern boundary of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to

        west of the Marquesas Keys and also found at the Dry Tortugas.

        Diverse communities variable in morphology and species composition.

        Both high and low relief. Includes all coral/hardbottom features

        distinguishable from "patch reefs."



        1. Spur and Groove



            a. Shallow (e.g., Looe Key) (CPSS)



                Well developed systems on "fore-reef" at major bank reefs on

                reef tract, with vertical relief to about 4m. Actively

                growing upward and outward. Distinctive signature on aerial

                photography due to shallow water (0 - 10m) and high vertical

                relief. Linear length to approximately 1000m or more.



            b. Drowned (Transitional = older, drowned) (CPSD)



                Older, not actively growing (probably eroding) features

                often being buried by sand migration from shallower zone of

                reef tract. Nearly typical spur and groove signature in

                aerial photographs, but sometimes with less resolution or

                definition. Usually low profile, about 0.5 - 1.5m. Visible

                to interpretable depth of photography (10m). Often greater

                linear length than shallow spur and groove.



        2. Remnant - Low profile (CPR)



            Coral/hardbottom features not exhibiting distinctive signature

            of spur and groove reefs. Usually parallel to line of reef

            tract, but may form transverse features perpendicular to the

            reef tract. Relief from less than 0.5m - 1 or 2m.



    C. Coral Patches in Bare Sand (CPB)



        Very sparse features that are similar in nature to patch reefs, but

        are on the outer reef tract. These areas are dominantly sand or a

        veneer of sand over low relief rock. Scattered throughout are small

        patches ranging from a single gorgonian, sponge, or small coral

        head up to a low assemblage that may be a few meters to 10m across.

        These patches make up a low percentage of the total cover, yet are

        distinctive. This class is found mainly in the area from Big Pine

        Shoal to Sombrero Light, and may be associated with the lack of a

        developed forereef structure in this area.



    D. Back Reef (CB)



        Shallow (<2m) platform landward of spur and groove features on bank

        reefs, typically rubble zone colonized with numerous soft corals

        and pioneering staghorn, fire and other hard corals. Corals here

        are widely spaced individuals on a rubble platform.



    E. Reef Rubble (CR)



        Zone landward of bank reefs and other high energy reef tract areas

        where unstable rubble exists with little or no visible

        colonization. In relatively shallow water (1 - 6m) often in

        association with Thallassia or Syringodium. Signature on the aerial

        photographs is distinctive from other coral/hardbottom communities.

        May form transverse features perpendicular to line of reef tract.



 II. Hardbottom (Inshore only, stops at Hawk Channel for the Florida Keys

 National Marine Sanctuary)



    Solid, flat, low-relief substrate composed of Key Largo limestone (from

    west end of the Newfound Harbor Keys off Big Pine to the north edge of

    the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary) or Miami oolite (Big Pine

    Key and west). Depth ranges from intertidal to approximately 7m in deep

    tidal channels and the inside edge of Hawk Channel. May include a thin

    veneer of carbonate sand or mud, too thin and unstable to support

    seagrass.



    A. Soft Coral, Hard Coral, Sponge, Algae (HC)



        Benthic community (no perceptible seagrass) is variable and

        typically a function of sediment, water, depth, and exposure to

        wind and current. May also include solitary hard corals, Porites

        sp., Sideratrea sp., and Manicina sp.. Shallowest zones (<1m) may

        include only attached or drift algae; soft corals are usually more

        common in deeper zones.



    B. Hardbottom with perceptible seagrass (<50%) (HS)



        Usually in patches, seagrasses occur in depressions and basins

        where adequate sediment has accumulated, but constitute <50% bottom

        coverage. Hard bottom may include solitary hard corals and soft

        corals, but most often sponges and benthic algae (attached or in

        draft).



 III. Bare Substrate



    Open and essentially unvegetated, with no benthic community visible on

    photographs, due to unstable nature of substrate. Can be large seagrass

    blowouts or active erosional features. Largest areas are on reef tract,

    in the bottom of Hawk Channel and west of the Marquesas Keys. May have

    sparse, ephemeral benthic algae or diatom films that are not detectable

    on photography. Diatom films may develop in a few days.



    A. Carbonate Sand (usually exposed locations) (BS)



        Sand-size carbonate sediments, usually in areas exposed to current

        and wind energy that continually sort out and remove finer sediment

        fractions.



    B. Carbonate Mud (usually protected location) (BM)



        Fine carbonate sediments in deep water (Hawk Channel) or locations

        protected from wind and wave energy. More depositional than

        erosional.



    C. Organic Mud (BO)



        On windward shorelines where drift seagrass and algae builds up in

        intertidal and shallow water. Continual deposition and resuspension

        of organic matter limits development of benthic community on

        natural as well as disturbed shorelines. Especially common feature

        on windward shorelines of Big Pine, No Name, and Little Pine Keys.



 IV. Seagrass



    A. Moderate to Dense, continuous beds (SD)



        Solid, continuous Thalassia, Syringodium, and Halodule,

        individually or in mixed beds. Widespread in occurrence with range

        in depth from intertidal (bank) to approximately 10m.



    B. Moderate to Dense, nearly continuous beds (seagrass>50%), with

    blowouts and/or sand or mud patches. (SDB)



        Solid, continuous Thalassia or Syringodium, rarely Halodule,

        individually or in mixed beds. Widespread in occurrence with range

        in depth from intertidal (bank) to approximately 10m. Moderate to

        high energy regimes. Here, blowouts or patches are dispersed as

        holes in otherwise continuous seagrass beds. Usually found on reef

        tract and near entrances to tidal channels and passes. A common

        habitat in back country of middle keys with large water movements

        between the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.



    C. Sparse, continuous beds (SS)



        Areas where seagrasses occur in low density (<50 shoots/m sq.).

        Typically in shallow protected bays where physical conditions or

        substrate limits development. May be hard to distinguish signature

        on aerial photographs from barren bottom, requiring ground

        truthing.



    D. Patchy



        Typically the result of depressional basins or creek-like features

        in seabed that accumulate sediment or contain organic peat deposits

        from mangrove community occurring during lower sea level. This

        greater depth of sediment allows seagrass development in an area,

        or allows denser seagrasses compared to surrounding areas.

        Widespread feature in inshore areas throughout the Florida Keys

        National Marine Sanctuary and Biscayne Bay.



        1. Dense patches of seagrass (>50%) in a matrix of Hardbottom.

        (SPH)



            One of the most common habitat types; patches occur in areas

            where a thin sediment layer over flat natural rock precludes

            development of seagrasses. Often numerous in number, highly

            visible on aerial photographs.



        2. Dense patches of seagrass in a matrix of sparse seagrass. (SPS)

            Depressional features with deep sediment allow denser

            development of seagrasses than on surrounding bottoms where

            only a thin layer may be present. May be difficult to discern

            on aerial photographs from seagrass patches in hardbottom. May

            occur more in deeper water or protected bays.



        3. Dominantly sand or mud with small scattered seagrass patches

        (<50%). (SPP)



            Large sand features with recognizable seagrass patches. Similar

            location to seagrass with blow-outs. Substrate may vary from

            sand to mud, and algae, either fixed or drift, may be a

            significant component. Offshore features tend to be more sandy,

            and inshore protected areas tend to be muddier in composition.



        4. Largely MacroAlgal cover with scattered seagrass patches. (SPA)

            Scattered seagrass patches are a significant habitat component,

            but dominant is background of macroalgae. Algal cover is banks

            of Halimeda sp. or Pencillus sp. May be difficult to delineate

            on aerial photographs without ground truthing.



 V. Special Modifiers



    Special Modifiers are attached to a specific community type when

    applicable. Ex. SDb; BSDBr



    A. Banks (Xb)



        Intertidal seagrass and some hardbottom communities, even if only

        intertidal at spring low tides, often open water features or

        extending out from a shoreline. Distinctive signature on aerial

        photographs compared to surrounding bottom. Sometimes burned off

        patches are present on bank top. If these patches become large

        enough, they are mapped as separate bare areas.



    B. Dredged/Excavation (Xd)



        Those locations where dredging or excavation has occurred for

        channels, rock mines, or anchorages.



    C. Restoration (Xr)



        Site of fill placement or backfilling of dredged area to restore

        original elevations and intertidal or benthic community.  Modifier

        applied to resulting benthic community. Local knowledge of

        restoration sites necessary.



 VI. Bottom Unknown, Unmappable, or Uninterpretable (BU; U)



    This refers to those areas that are beyond the depth threshold of the

    aerial photography (approximately 9m), and/or uninterpretable due to

    glare, or turbid waters. Most narrow or deep access channels such as

    Key West Harbor, Hawk Channel, or the deeper sides of the reef tract.

Abstract:

These Bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were

generated from original point soundings collected during

hydrographic surveys conducted by the National Ocean Service

and its predecessors.  Mean High Water shoreline as defined

by NOAA nautical charts was used as a constraining boundary

and assigned its local elevation relative to the local datum

(typically Mean Low Water).  DEM grid values outside the

shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676).  In

the event of multiple surveys in a region, the most recent

survey soundings were retained.  Both 7.5 minute and 1 degree

DEMs are available.  The 1 degree DEMs were generated from

the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary.



A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations

ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from

west to east.  The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record

(A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records)

each of which include a short B-record header followed by a

series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1

centimeter {0.01 meter]) per each profile.  The last physical

record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record).



The 1 degree (60-minute) DEMs (3 arc second x 3 arc second

dataspacing) is cast on the geographic coordinate system (no

projection).  It provides coverage in 1 degree square blocks.

Each product contains over edge data.  Coverage is available

for the many estuaries of the conterminous United States, but

is not complete.



The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection.  It provides

coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks.  Each product provides

the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but

the DEM contains over edge data.  Coverage is available for many

estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.



Purpose:

Bathymetric DEM's can be used as layers in geographic information

systems for earth science analysis.  DEM's can also serve as tools

for volumetric analysis, for site location of structures, or for

drainage basin delineation.  The source soundings are collected by

the National Ocean Survey.



Supplemental_Information:

The datum for these bathymetric DEMs (Mean Low Water) is not the

same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based

DEMs (NAV29) which results in a discontinuity of about _ the tidal

range.  Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate

and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs.  Furthermore,

the vertical resolution is smaller and accuracy of the Bathymetric

DEMs is better than USGS DEMs.  Because of these differences, extreme

care should be used in merging NOAA and USGS DEM data.

  

One Degree bathymetric DEMs have profiles (north-south lines)  containing

1201 soundings.  Missing values (over land as defined by the Mean

High Water Line) are filled with null values represented by the

value -32676.  Profiles within the One degree square which contain

only null values are omitted.



7.5-minute DEMs have rows and columns which vary in length and are

staggered.  The UTM bounding coordinates form a quadrilateral (no two

sides are parallel to each other), rather than a rectangle.  The

user will need to pad out the uneven rows and columns with blanks

or flagged data values, if a rectangle is required for the user's

application.  Some software vendors have incorporated this function

into their software for input of standard formatted USGS DEMs.



Access_Constraints: none

Use_Constraints:  Not to be used for Navigation.

Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,

National Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from

these data.

as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs

(NAV29) which results in a discontinuity of about _ the tidal range.

Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the

Attribute_Accuracy_Report:

The accuracy of a DEM is dependent upon the level of detail of the source

soundings and the grid spacing used to sample that source. The primary

limiting factor for the level of detail of the source is the scale of

the source survey, the technology used to collect soundings, and the

resolution of the source soundings.  Additional complications is

describing accuracy are the ages of the surveys used to collect

sounding in a given area.  Care was used to use the most recent

surveys covering a given area but in some instances adjacent surveys

may be decades apart in age.  In some regions, the only source data

were at fathom (6 feet) resolution.  In general, most source surveys

were certified to one foot or better by the National Ocean Service.

Logical_Consistency_Report:

The fidelity of the relationships encoded in the data structure of

the DEM are automatically verified using a NOAA-NOS software program

upon completion of the data production cycle.  The test verifies

full compliance to the DEM specification.

Completeness_Report:

The DEM is visually inspected for completeness on a DEM view and

edit system for the purpose of performing a final quality control

and if necessary, edit of the DEM.  The physical format of each digital

elevation model is validated for content completeness and logical

consistency during production quality control and prior to archiving

in the National Geographic Data Center.



Due to the variable orientation of the 7.5 minute quadrilateral in

relation to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection grid,

profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral may

be void of elevation grid points and are not represented in the DEM.

This condition occurs infrequently and is always the first or last

profile of the dataset.



DEM's may contain void areas caused by elevations being above

Mean High Water or on non tidal land.  Void area elevation grid

posts are assigned the value of -32,767.  In  addition, suspect

elevation areas may exist in the DEM but are not specifically identified.



Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:

The horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated

root mean square error (RMSE).  The estimate of the RMSE is based

upon horizontal accuracy tests of the source soundings used to

generate the DEM.  As a first approximation the locational accuracy

of the source soundings are 0.0015 m at source smooth sheet scale

(120 m @ 1:80,000 to 15 m @ 1:10,000)



Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Explanation: Digital elevation

models meet horizontal National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS)

accuracy requirements.



Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:

The vertical RMSE statistic is used to describe the vertical

accuracy of a DEM. It encompasses both random and systematic

errors introduced during production of the data. The RMSE is

encoded in element number 5 of record C of the DEM.  This accuracy

estimate includes components related to quantization of the source

soundings (1.3 to 0.15 m), the systematic editing of the source

data (1% or 0.10m), un-sampled bathymetric features (estimated at

less than 5% of depth), time related changes (erosion, deposition,

and seismic shifts), and dredging operations (cut and fill)



It is estimated that the accuracy of the Bathymetric DEMs is 2% of

depth or 1 meter for depths grater than 20 meters and  2 % of depth

or 0.20 meters for depths shallower than 20 meters.  These DEMs

are NOT to be used for navigation.



There are three types of DEM vertical errors: blunder, systematic,

and random.  These errors are reduced in magnitude by editing

but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunders are errors of major

proportions and are easily identified and removed during interactive

editing.  Systematic errors follow some fixed pattern and are

introduced by data collection procedures and systems.  Systematic

error artifacts include vertical unsampled elevation shifts,

relative spacing of the source soundings, misinterpretation of

terrain surface caused by softness or poor reflectivity and by

the resolution of the collected soundings (feet, feet & fractions,

fathoms, fathoms & fractions, meters, tenths of meters etc.).

Random errors result from unknown or accidental causes.  The 1 degree

(DSQ) DEMs are generated from 30 m grids on UTM projection.  The

rms difference between these surfaces is an estimate of the

vertical accuracy of the DSQ DEMs.

Documentation

Logsheets were kept at all stages of processing to track file

names, dates, hydrographic survey coverage, and soundings or

hydrographic surveys that were deleted as part of the quality

control process. A short summary of the processing steps for each

estuary is available on the individual data pages.  In addition,

a list of each of the surveys which were included is accessible

through the individual data pages. 



Overview

Original hydrographic data from the National Ocean Service and it

predecessors was used exclusively as source data.  Processing was

performed on desktop computers using a variety of commercial and

custom software systems.  The two main software systems used were

Digital Optimization of Grid Systems (DOGS) version 1.5x software

developed by NOAA and MapInfo Professional version 4.5 published by

MapInfo augmented by a MapInfo add-on named Vertical Mapper published

by Northwood Geosciences.  The processing sequence for each estuary

started with the generation of a comprehensive source data set from

the NOS archives, These source sounding were quality controlled to

eliminate outliers and superseded surveys, optimized to reduce the

number of data values, augmented with points representing the Mean

High Water shoreline, and then gridded.  The gridded data sets were

converted from the internal proprietary grid format to Digital

Elevation Model (DEM) format for public distribution.



Creating Point Sets of Hydrographic Survey Data 

Sounding data obtained from Hydrographic Surveys were extracted

using DOGS from the GEODAS CD distributed by the National Geophysical

Data Center using each estuary's shoreline as a clipping boundary.

Large estuaries were broken into several overlapping regions and

subsets of points were extracted and processed. Most historic

hydrographic surveys are included on the GEODAS CD.  For those

regions which were missing data (parts of southern Florida & Chesapeake

Bays only), soundings were digitized from a hard copy Smooth sheets

generated by the Hydrographic surveys. 



Editing and Quality Control of Bathymetry Point Data 

The first step of the quality control was to review the data using

the DOGS software.  The data were first examined for surveys or parts

of surveys that are redundant. For many areas there are more surveys

than are actually useful.  Entire surveys or large portions of surveys

were deleted for the following reasons.  Another more recent survey

fully covers the same area.  The survey has questionable values

which can not be fixed by way of figuring out a mathematical update

value for the entire survey, and there are too many bad points to

pick out probable 'good' values.  Sections of surveys were omitted

if they were overlapped by more accurate surveys or by similar yet

denser coverage.  The second step was to display the data by depth

values and to remove stray points that were obvious outliers from

the surrounding data values.



Optimizing the Bathymetry Point Data using DOGS

The data was first triangulated in DOGS in order to optimize the

set of points. The computer program DOGS can analyze a large set of

bathymetric data and create from it a smaller set of optimized points

which describes the bathymetry of a geographic region to within a

user defined error.  This smaller data set then can be used on its

own as a representation of the area's bathymetry, or as input into

other computer programs or Geographical Information Systems. 



There are two calculation options for triangulation in DOGS: relative

and absolute.  Bathymetry point files were cut into sections for

separate processing based on mean depth of 10 meters.  A relative

height error criteria of 0.01 was used for the triangulation of

regions whose depths averaged above 10 meters.  An absolute height

error criteria of 0.1 meters was used for areas with average

depths less than 10 meters.  The two resultant files were saved

as text files.  After combining these files, the vertical error

associated with the optimized data set was 1% of depth or 0.1 meters,

whichever was greater.  



The optimized DOG file was imported into MapInfo's MapInfo

Professional desktop mapping software.



Augmenting the data set with Shoreline Points

The final bathymetry was clipped to NOAA's 1:250,000 or 1:80,000

Coastal Assessment Framework (CAF) shoreline, depending on which

was available at the time of processing (Only a few of the estuaries

have 1:80K shoreline data).  A copy of the shoreline file was edited

to create a point file from the vector vertices and optimized using

DOGS to produce a more workable, smaller file, with little compromise

to the shape of the shoreline.  Mean High Water tide level was

assigned to the shoreline points to give them a height.  These

Shoreline data points were added to the set of bathymetry points

before doing the final triangulation in MapInfo.



Generation of a Gridded Bathymetry Dataset

Linear triangulation of the combined point files were done in

MapInfo using the Vertical Mapper 2.0 partner product software.

The resultant TIN file was then used to create a continuous grid

file with 30 meter resolution on a UTM projection  using a NAD27

horizontal datum.  A second grid was created from the first by

aggregating the 30 meter grid values to 90 meter resolution and

performing a rectangular interpolation to a geographic 3 arc second

resolution grid.   Both grids were cut to the estuary boundary

shoreline.  7.5 minute and 1 degree sections were then created

from these grids.  The 7.5 minute grids have 30 meter resolution in

a UTM  projection using the NAD27 datum.  The 1 degree grids have

a 3 arc second resolution in a geographic projection (Latitude/Longitude)

using the NAD27 datum.  In their native form, both of these grids

are in proprietary formats.



Creating Polygon Contour Intervals (available for Florida Bay only)

12 separate 1 degree sections (3 arc second) were contoured using

Vertical Mapper's contouring tools within MapInfo.  The contours are

created from the GRD files created by processes described in the

preceding paragraph.  Each grid was contoured individually, and contour

intervals were input by the technician.  Each of the 1 degree polygon

contour sections was exported from MapInfo's MIF format to ArcView's

SHP format.  The 12 SHP files were then imported into ArcView 3.0 and

like depths joined with the Œmerge features' tool after straight-line

heads-up editing was performed to close gaps or eliminate overlaps as

necessary, thus creating a single continuous data file.



Creating DEM files

The MapInfo grid files were converted to a public domain USGS format

DEM files using the NOAA DEM maker software.  The formats available

for downloading are 30 meter & 3 arc second DEMs in USGS DEM format.



DEM's are viewed on interactive editing systems to identify and

correct blunder and systematic errors.  DEM's are verified for

physical format and logical consistency.

The digital elevation model is composed of a elevation value

linked to a grid cell location representing a gridded form of a

bathymetric map overlay.  Each grid cell entity contains a 6-character

integer value between  -32,767 and 32,768.  The grid is generated

from profiles of data each containing header information (profile

identifier, starting point, relative datum for profile values

(deepest value within the DEM), number of values, etc) followed by

profile values relative to the relative datum for the profile.  All

non-null values in the profile are positive.

GENERAL INFORMATION - Aids to Navigation

Name: ATONS

Title: U. S. COAST GUARD AIDS TO NAVIGATION (ATONS)

Feature Type: POINT

Geographic Extent: STATEWIDE

Creation Date: UNKNOWN

Purpose: TO VISUALLY REPRESENT GEOSPATIAL DATA

Description-Abstract:    THE TERM "AIDS TO NAVIGATION" REFERS TO A DEVICE

 OUTSIDE OF A VESSEL USED TO ASSIST MARINERS IN DETERMINING THEIR POSITION

 OR SAFE COURSE, OR TO WARN THEM OF OBSTRUCTIONS.  AIDS TO NAVIGATION

 INCLUDE LIGHTHOUSES, LIGHTS, BOUYS, SOUND SIGNALS, LANDMARKS, RACONS,

 RADIO BEACONS, LORAN, AND OMAGA. THESE INCLUDE AIDS WHICH ARE INSTALLED

 AND MAINTAINED BY THE COAST GUARD AS WELL AS PRIVATELY INSTALLED AND

 MAINTAINED AIDS (PERMIT REQUIRED).  THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE UNOFFICIAL AIDS 

 (ILLEGAL) SUCH AS STAKES, PVC PIPES, AND SUCH PLACED WITHOUT PERMISSION.

 THIS DATA SET IS NOT CERTIFIED FOR NAVIGATION AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE

 USED FOR NAVIGATION PURPOSES.



 EACH USCG DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UPDATING THEIR DATABASE

 ON AN "AS NEEDED" BASIS.  WHEN EXISTING AIDS ARE DESTROYED OR RELOCATED

 AND NEW AIDS ARE INSTALLED THE DATABASE IS UPDATED.  EACH AID IS ASSIGNED

 AN OFFICIAL "LIGHT LISTING NUMBER."  THE LIGHT LIST IS A DOCUMENT LISTING

 THE CURRENT STATUS OF ATONS AND IT IS PUBLISHED AND DISTRIBUTED ON A

 REGULAR BASIS.  INTERIM CHANGES TO THE LIGHT LIST ARE PUBLISHED IN LOCAL 

 NOTICES TO MARINERS WHICH ARE THE OFFICIAL MEANS WHICH NAVIGATORS ARE

 SUPPOSED TO KEEP THEIR CHARTS CURRENT.  IN ADDITION, THE USCG BROADCASTS

 NOTICES TO MARINERS ON THE MARINE BAND RADIO AS SOON AS CHANGES OF THE

 STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL AIDS ARE REPORTED.



 THE LIGHT LIST NUMBER AND LOCAL NOTICE TO MARINERS ARE SUGGESTED WAYS

 TO KEEP THE DATABASE CURRENT ON A REGULAR OR EVEN "REAL TIME" BASIS.

 HOWEVER, ANNUAL (OR MORE FREQUENT) UPDATES OF THE ENTIRE DATASET COULD

 BE OBTAINED FROM EACH USCG DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS.



 POSITIONAL ACCURACY: THE LOCATIONS OF THESE AIDS ARE DETERMINED BY

 VARIOUS MEANS INCLUDING USCG MAINTENANCE CREWS, INSTATLLATION

 CONTRACTORS, USCG AUXILIARY CREWS, AND PERMIT APPLICATIONS.  ALTHOUGH

 THE USCG CONDUCTS ROUTINE CHECKS ON POSITIONS, THE COORDINATES IN THIS 

 DATASET MIGHT NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LOCATION OF INDIVIDUAL AIDS.

 BOUYS ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEA FLOOR WITH LONG CHAINS AND WILL NOT

 HAVE CONSISTENT POSITIONS.  BE WARNED THAT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS DO

 EXISTS IN THIS DATASET.

 COVERAGE, ALL FEATURES ARE ROADS OF DIFFERENT TYPES.  THE CFCC, AS

 USED IN THE TIGER/LINE(TM) FILES, IS A THREE-CHARACTER CODE.

 THE FIRST CHARACTER IS A LETTER DESCRIBIBG THE FEATURE CLASS

 THE MINOR CATEGORY.



         FEATURE CLASS 'A', ROADS



 DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO ROAD



 THE DEFINITION OF A DIVIDED HIGHWAY HAS BEEN THE SOURCE 

 OF CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION.  EARLIER SPECIFICATIONS HAVE 

 DEFINED A "DIVIDED" ROAD AS HAVING "... OPPOSING TRAFFIC 

 LANES THAT ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY A MEDIAN STRIP NO 

 LESS THAN 70 FEET WIDE IN FORMER GBF/DIME AREAS OR NO 

 LESS THAN 200 FEET WIDE IN NON-GBF/DIME AREAS."  THIS 

 DEFINITION CAUSED CONFUSION IN THE PROPER CODING OF 

 INTERSTATES HAVING NARROW MEDIANS.  TO CLARIFY THE 

 SITUATION, THE CENSUS BUREAU NOW USES THE TERM "DIVIDED" 

 TO REFER TO A ROAD WITH OPPOSING TRAFFIC LANES SEPARATED 

 BY ANY SIZE MEDIAN, AND "SEPARATED" TO REFER TO LANES 

 THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN THE CENSUS TIGER DATA BASE AS 

 TWO DISTINCT COMPLETE CHAINS.  EARLIER OPERATIONS MAY 

 HAVE DEPICTED WIDELY SEPARATED LANES AS A SINGLE LINE IN 

 THE DATA BASE OR CREATED SEPARATE LINES WHEN THE MEDIAN 

 WAS SMALL, DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABLE SOURCE USED DURING 

 THE UPDATE.



 THE TERM "RAIL LINE IN CENTER" INDICATES THAT A RAIL 

 LINE SHARES THE ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE RAIL LINE MAY 

 FOLLOW THE CENTER OF THE ROAD OR BE DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE 

 ROAD, REPRESENTATION IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABLE 

 SOURCE USED DURING THE UPDATE.  THE RAIL LINE CAN 

 REPRESENT A RAILROAD, A STREET CAR LINE, OR OTHER 

 CARLINE.



 ROAD WITH MAJOR CATEGORY UNKNOWN (A0_):



 SOURCE MATERIALS DO NOT ALLOW DETERMINATION OF THE MAJOR 

 ROAD CATEGORY.  THESE CODES SHOULD NOT, UNDER MOST 

 CIRCUMSTANCES, BE USED SINCE THE SOURCE MATERIALS 

 USUALLY PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE 

 MAJOR CATEGORY.

 CHANGES, ACCESS TO THE HIGHWAY IS BY WAY OF RAMPS, AND 

 THERE ARE MULTIPLE LANES OF TRAFFIC.  A ROAD IN THIS 

 CATEGORY HAS THE OPPOSING TRAFFIC LANES "DIVIDED" BY A 

 MEDIAN STRIP.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND SOME TOLL 

 HIGHWAYS ARE IN THIS MAJOR CATEGORY.  THE TIGER/LINE(TM) 

 FILES MAY DEPICT THE OPPOSING LANES OF A ROAD IN THIS 

 CATEGORY AS TWO DISTINCT LINES; IN THIS CASE THE ROAD IS 

 CALLED "SEPARATED."
