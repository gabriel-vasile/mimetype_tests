01 Nov 98:    Widespread coverage of showers with embedded convection continues
              for most of the day.  Several large convective clusters with heavy
              rain develop and push into the radar FOV from the E and SE.  After
              19Z, the activity becomes more scattered in coverage.  Overall, a
              very heavy precip day.
              
              Data gap from 0417Z to 0803Z due to waveguide leak and resulting
              transmitter shutdown.

02 Nov 98:    Scattered showers and strong convective cells are present during the first few
              hours of the day.  The intensity gradually weakens and the system transitions
              into a region of light to moderate rain before dissipating and moving out of the
              radar FOV.  Near 1630Z, a thin line of strong convection moves over the radar site.

03 Nov 98:    Isolated light to moderate showers persist through the early UTC hours.  This
              activity rapidly increases in coverage and intensity after 09Z, when many thin
              bands of moderate showers with embedded convective looking cells rotate into the
              radar FOV from the N and NE.  Widespread showers and convection covers mainly the
              Northern half of the scope in a broken pattern through the remainder of the day.
              Several showers bands propogate directly over the radar site.

              out of the radar FOV toward the SW during the 00 and 01Z hours.  No additional real

06 Nov 98:    Scattered light to moderate showers with embedded small convective cells are present
              throughout most of the day.  After 12Z, the activity increases in coverage and intensity,
              but still remains scattered.  Several thin convective lines develop and move directly over
              the radar site.  Near 1630Z, a thin intense convective line moves from E to W over the
              radar.  Unfortunately, there is a 3 hour data gap near this time.  When the data resumes
              (near 1940Z) continuous scattered showers and small intense convective cells cover the
              scope in an unorganized appearance through the end of the day.

07 Nov 98:    A moderately active day at Kwajalein.  Scattered light to moderate showers with numerous
              embedded convective cells are present over the entire scope throughout the early part
              of the day (UTC).  After 08Z, precip increases in coverage and intensity primarily in
              the Southern half of the scope.  Several large convective clusters develop and move into
              the radar FOV and pass just to the south of the radar site, while only scattered light
              showers and isolated convective cells occur in the Northern half of the scope.  From
              15Z ~ 19Z, a large convective complex with a trailing stratiform rain area passes just 
              South of the radar.  After this system passes, only isolated light showers and
              a couple convective cells pass to the South while the day winds to a close.

09 Nov 98:    Showers and convective systems rapidly develop and push into the radar FOV after 02Z.
              The leading edge of this activity, which pushes over the radar site (near 0630Z), is denoted
              by a 30 dBZ band of showers with embedded convective cells.  The majority of the convective
              clusters and stratiform rains remain in the southern half of the scope, while only scattered
              (but intense) thin convective bands and cells pass North of the radar.  Several thin intense
              convective bands pass directly over the radar site (especially from 13-16Z), while what
              appears to be a large area of moderate (30+ dBZ) stratiform rain passes south of the radar
              between 100-150 km range.  Complex, dynamic interactions occur with converging convective
              lines and outflow boundaries.  By 18Z, most activity has exited the scope and only scattered
              to isolated small convective cells and light/moderate showers remain (in the southern half). 
              After 23Z, organized convective lines push into the southern half of the scope once again.
              This is a very active day at Kwajalein.

10 Nov 98:    Widespread showers with embedded convective cells blankets the southern half of 
              the scope throughout most of the day.  A significant area of moderate (30+ dBZ) 
              rain with embedded convective cells passes south of the radar from 03Z-05Z.  Only
              a few light showers and isolated stronger cells are present north of the radar.

                                      subjective call on my part is that it is better to remove moderate/
                                      intense spurious echo, than to be overly concerned with removal
                                      of shallow light showers (10-15 dBZ).  Successful quality control
                                      is extremely difficult with this combination of spurious echo and

14 Nov 98:    Scattered light to moderate showers are present mainly in the southern half
              of the scope from 00-08Z.  After 09Z, widespread shower activity develops
              quickly and also moves into the radar FOV from the East.  The showers are mainly
              light (<30 dBZ), but heavier more organized clusters of moderate rain with embedded
              convective cells are also present.  Most of the precip moves out of the radar FOV
              by 21Z, and isolated showers and small convective cells develop and move into view
              through the remaining hours.

17 Nov 98:    Significant precip returns to Kwaj.  The day begins with widespread showers and
              convection pushing into the FOV from the E and S.  A band of light/mod showers with
              embedded strong cells pushes over the radar near 0130Z, and again near 0441Z.  
              Steadier, general rains tend to remain in the southern half of the scope while
              several lines of showers and scattered convection pass over the radar and to the North.
              Near 0610Z, a convective cluster with max echo intensity near 50 dBZ moves from E
              to W over the radar site and quickly loses intensity, while widespread convection
              passes from E to W near 100 km range N of the radar.  Scattered convective cells
              and light showers continue through the remainder of the day.  Near 23Z, a thin,
              intense line of convection (max echo near 50 dBZ) moves over the radar from the NE.
              Scattered activity begins to gel into a more impressive convective cluster to
              the West of the radar near the end of the day.

20 Nov 1998:  Widespread light to moderate showers with embedded convection dominates in the
              southern half of the scope for the majority of the day.  Only limited data is
              available on this day.  The northern half of the scope contains only isolated
              showers and very small convective cells.  A small area of convection moves from
              E to W over the radar location near 08:30Z.  All significant echoes remain to
              the South of the radar.  The usual problems of second trip echo, land clutter, and
              sea clutter are present in the raw DZ field.

              Early in the day, a band of showers with ~50 dBZ embedded cells is oriented
              NW to SE and is located to the SW of the radar.  Additional N-S oriented bands
              with 30-50 dBZ intensities rapidly develop and move from E to W.  A long NS band
              with convective cells passes over the radar near 04Z.  Activity then becomes more
              scattered in converage until after 09Z when thin convective lines rapidly develop
              and move into the radar FOV from the West.  Several lines move over the radar
              location.   Toward the end of the day (Noon local time), widespread activity
              remains in the northern half of the scope, and dissipates in the southern half
              of the scope.  Siginficant second trip echo contamination.  Some velocity folding

24 Nov 98:    Widespread convection and showers slowly dissipate and move out of the
              radar FOV from 00Z to 06Z.  Beginning near 07Z, intense organized bands
              of convection and showers develop over the entire scope.  The heaviest
              precip appears to be centered in the middle of the scope and over the
              radar location.  This activity continues through the end of the day.  
              Near the end of the day, and intense V shaped bow echo squall line
              with trailing stratiform rain develops to the East of the radar.
              Maximum reflectivity in this line approaches 45-50 dBZ.

*******************************************************************************

25 Nov 98:    A very complex weather day at Kwajalein!!!
              The ITCZ appears to be located over Kwaj resulting in complex echo
              patterns for the majority of the day.  From 00 to 06Z, several bands
              of showers and convection race from E to W across the scope, while
              lighter bands of showers move from S to N.  After 06Z, a large area of
              stratiform rain moves from S to N over the radar, (slight rotation in this
              field can be detected), while intense convective cells develop in the
              northern half of the scope.  The cells move basically E to W while the
              stratiform region of rain pushes up from the south and converges with them.
              By 1940Z, the widespread rain moves to the N and W out of the radar scope
              while intense convective cells begin to develop in the southern half of
              the scope.  These cells remain somewhat stationary and slowly diminish
              in coverage and intensity.  Most echos diminish by 23Z, with only
              a few small 10-15 dBZ cells present.  Ray dropouts are located at various
              azimuths throughout the day.

26 Nov 98:    Another complex weather day at KWAJ influenced by ITCZ interactions.
              Thin lines of showers with embedded small convective cells push into
              the radar scope from the south and north.  Several E-W oriented lines
              of showers and convection develop to the south of the radar due to the
              converging flow.  These lines begin forming near 01Z, then dissipate and
              reform through 14Z.  After 14Z and continuing through 23Z, most of the
              activity is contained in the western half of the scope.  A large convective
              cell (stationary) is located to the SW near 140 km range, while several
              bands of showers push into the scope from the NW.  Small convective cells
              and 30 dBZ showers develop to the W and NW at mid and far range from
              18Z through 23Z.  These cells and showers remain mostly stationary and
              appear to build to the NW.

27 Nov 98:    A band of showers and convection remains somewhat stationary to the NW at
              far range through the 12Z hour.  Very little additional activity is present on
              the scope until after 12Z when some scattered light to moderate showers develop
              to the North.  Light to moderate showers (up to 25-30 dBZ) attempt to push
              into the scope from the NW from 14Z to 18Z, and quickly dissipate.  Isolated
              to scattered showers and small convective cells continue to develop and
              dissipate to the N through the 23Z hour.  An area of light showers pushes
              into the radar FOV from the SE after 21Z and advances to the West
              through 23Z.

29 Nov 98:    Numerous, unorganized, moderate to intense convective cells and
              light showers cover the scope for most of the day.  Activity begins
              to increase in coverage and intensity in the southern half of the
              scope near 12Z.  After 22Z, a mesoscale system begins to push into
              the radar FOV from the south.  This system appears to intensify
              through the end of the day.  Widespread second trip echo contamination
              is present to the south as the majority of the mesoscale system
              appears to be just beyond radar range.

30 Nov 98:    Large, but rapidly decaying, mesoscale system present along the 
              extreme southern fringe of the radar scope early on.  Accompanying
              this complex, and covering much of the rest of the radar scope,
              are numerous, unorganized, moderate to intense convective cells.
              All convective activity dissipates and/or moves out of range by 
              09Z.  A lull in activity exists until ~15Z, when scattered cells
              (weaker than earlier in the day) once again begin filling in the 
              scope.  This scattered convection persists through the end of the
              day.  Reduction of reflectivity at 2341Z and 2351Z probably from
              solar calibration procedure.

              Data analyzed:  0000-2351Z

              Satellite Coincidence:  0004Z(367 km), 1306Z(705 km)
