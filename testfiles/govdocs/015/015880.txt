Title: Agriculture near Uberlandia, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, South America

Description:

Very large fields, typical of commercial and irrigated farmland, contrast  
with patchy upland agriculture in this view of southeastern Brazil (18.5S, 
47.5W).  A reservoir, just to the northeast of the city of Uberlandia,
State  of Minas Gerais, serves as the water source and is fed by the Rios
Sao Marcos  and the Rio Paranaiba.  Near the bottom of the photo is
circular feature with  a plume of smoke thought to be a mining operation
and smelter.
