Title: Linear Dunes and Playas, Simson Desert, South Australia, Australia

Description:

This image of abstract shapes is comprised numerous subparallel, very long, 
orange colored linear dunes and patchy grey dry lakes (playas).  The dunes 
are aligned north to south in the great central basin of Astralia (27.0S, 
138.0E).  The regularity of the dunes is created by the winds blowing from 
the south.  As the dunes advance, jaged edges on the south side of each dry 
lake are formed while the north side is eroded smooth by the wind and
water.
