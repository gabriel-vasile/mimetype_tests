			ARESE Meteorological Summary

		       0000 - 2359 UTC 28 October 1995
                                 (Flight 13)


High pressure passed just to the west of the region during the last half
of the day and provided mostly clear skies.  A moist layer, shown nicely
in the Oklahoma City and Central Facility soundings at 3 km, led to the
development of patchy stratus during the early morning over the eastern
edge of the region (0900 UTC).  The stratus moved east and thinned soon
after to leave generally clear skies until very late in the period when
cirrus moved over much of the region.  A west-coast trough was bringing
a large amount of subtropical moisture northeastward- the cirrus were the
leading edge of this moisture.  To the south, cirrus and some lower cloud 
were overspreading Texas as moisture from the Pacific (aloft) and Gulf of
Mexico (below) influenced the weather down there.
Surface winds dropped rapidly early in the period and remained light,
generally northwesterly, for the rest of the period.
