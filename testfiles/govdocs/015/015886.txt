          E866 Offline/Backend Software Standards
          ---------------------------------------

CERNLIBS -

    HBOOK - histograming system.

    NTUPLES - standard format scannable by CERN PAW.

    PAW - histogram and ntuple graphics display and ntuple scanning interface.

    ZEBRA - memory management or data structures. Used only for internal
      storage of banks (e.g. drift chamber hit and track banks). NOT used
      for media storage (e.g. RZ and FZ files) except for Ntuples.

    KUIP - command interface for back-end analysis programs.

    FFREAD -  old command interface for offline programs.

CMZ - code-management environment (replaces PATCHY)

BUFIO - Input/Output interface from Fermilab for UNIX machines.

XMGR - Public Domain plotting program; excellant for publication
       quality figures.

Postscript - Presently defacto standard for dissemination of graphics
       and formatted text.

WWW/Mosaic - Dissemination of all documention/info via World-Wide Web
       with access restrictions as appropriate.

UNIX - e.g. HP, SGI, IBM/R6000,...; Our programs run on most any UNIX
       machine with little modification. They once ran on VMS so you
       are welcome to try to get it running again but don't ask for
       help from core software people. Can't Alphas run UNIX?

FNAL/CPS - Fermilab parallel-processing environment (Cooperative Process
       System). Requires that all global storage be in a few very large
       commons.

FTP - for file transfer.

XWINDOWS - for graphics display, particularily PAW and MOSAIC.
