Telecom Report for SOLll
7/15/97, 15:52:00 PM PDT

No new sequence was uploaded for SOLll. Only SOL10 commands were received.

The Rover Telecom Subsystem performed nominally during operations for SOLll.
The Rover radio modem and LMRE radio modem can be used without restriction
for upcoming sequences.

Statistics

The Lander has been experiencing synch problems with the Block-V receiver,
resulting in lost blocks in the downlink sessions. Attempts to verify APXS
quality from Yogi were unsuccessful during the morning LGA downlink, at
which point the analysis team was excused until further confirmation of
APXS quality hopefully by late SOLll.

Data on the LMRE modem continues to be patchy due to the lander's new
strategy of disabling LMRE activity during IMP operation.

Rover temperature dropped to -16 C prior to wakeup on SOLll.
Peak temperatures reached +33 in the afternoon of SOL10.

Lander side frame counts indicate a link quality of 85% for 549 frames.

Rover link performance is down to 23% (2332 txmt for 543 rcvd) probably due 
to power cycling the LMRE modem.

Recommendations for SOL12 are to continue heating the rover
modem for 600 seconds, reheating 300 secs, prior to wakeup.
LMRE power should also be switched to A-side (ie heating) for
600 seconds prior to rover wakeup, then back to B-side for normal
operations.
