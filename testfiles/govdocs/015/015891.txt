Six days were suitable for fieldwork during the week ending October 9, 
according to the USDA, NASS, Michigan Field Office.  Precipitation amounts 
ranged from none in the central Lower Peninsula to 2.24 inches in the eastern 
Upper Peninsula.  Average temperatures ranged from 3 degrees above normal in 
the western Upper Peninsula to 8 degrees above normal in the northwest, 
northeast, west central, central and east central Lower Peninsula.  There 
were reports of variable frost across the State.  A farmer in the northwest

should help dry down corn but stopped the growth of fall crops."  A farmer 
from the southwest mentioned, "Very light, patchy frost this morning.  The 
temperatures have been on a roller coaster from a warm and humid 80 degrees 
to a chilly, cloudy 40 degrees."
