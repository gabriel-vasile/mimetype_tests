Brown and Ralph P. Merritt, <I>Final Report,Manzanar,</I> 1946</B></P><P>Prepared in February 1946 by Brown and Merritt, the "ProjectDirector's Report," in the <I>Final Report, Manzanar,</I> provided alengthy analysis of the factors that led to the "Manzanar Incident" thusexpressing the views of its authors with the benefit of hindsight andreflection, an opportunity to discuss issues with evacuees, and accessto WRA and relocation center records. According to this report, theoperation of the center under WRA administration "began to develop in amore or less normal manner" after June 1, 1942. While the operation ofthe center was developing during the ensuing months, however, "thedevelopment of leadership within the Center became stranded upon theshoals of mismanagement and meddling."</P><P>The struggle for leadership at Manzanar, according to this report,"was the struggle between Nisei and Issei." While there were "manyvariations and off-shoots of this struggle given names such as"Pro-Japanism" and "Pro-Americanism," these titles, according to theauthors, were "more nearly handy labels to be pasted over old feudsrather than a representation of any real source of the struggle."</P><P>Block representatives had been a part of the Manzanar picture sinceWCCA days. At first block managers were appointed by the management fromthree nominees selected by the residents in each block. Later, as thecamp was filling to capacity, a new method was effected whereby a blockcould elect a leader once the population of that block reached 200.</P><P>Most of the potential leaders of Manzanar recognized that eventuallythe block manager position would be an important one, but the youngerpeople (Nisei) also recognized that under existing social customsgoverning Japanese American communities, only the elders in thecommunity would be elected leaders. To counteract this trend, the Niseibegan to exert efforts to obtain important administrative jobs anddominate the political life of the center. After the center had beenoperating for four months, most of the important administrativepositions which were available to evacuees were held by Nisei, whilemost of the block manager positions were held by Issei.</P><P>Considerable discussion was conducted over the form of communityself-government at Manzanar. The Washington office informed therelocation centers that a pattern of self-government would beforthcoming and requested the projects not to do anything of a permanentnature in formulating self-government procedures. The notice fromWashington disturbed the Nisei who were not, in their estimation,adequately represented in any governing body in the centers. To offsetthis problem, they moved in two directions. At Manzanar, a group ofyoung Nisei, led by Fred Tayama, organized the Manzanar Citizens'Federation on July 12. Simultaneously, the Japanese American CitizensLeague, with headquarters in Salt Lake City, organized an effectivelobby to have the Washington office recognize the Nisei as the onlypersons capable under law to vote or hold office in the relocationcenter community governments.</P><P>The Manzanar Citizens' Federation was a coalition of pro-America andpro-Communist patriots whose concerns coalesced in the matter ofmilitary service, with volunteering for a "second front" the overridingconcern. At Manzanar, those who organized the Manzanar Citizens'Federation claimed that the Issei were only representing onegenerational point of view. They claimed that cases of discriminationand infringement of civil liberties in the evacuation program could onlybe fought by a citizens' group &#151; the Nisei. They also claimed thatthe Issei were not considerate of the Kibei group and that the Kibeiwere, in reality, American citizens who needed guidance from the neworganization.</P><P>Four objectives were adopted as the focus of the new organization.These were to: (1) improve conditions in the camp; (2) educate citizensfor leadership; (3) participate in the war effort; and (4) prepare apostwar program to meet the needs of all evacuees.</P><P>According to Brown and Merritt, the Nisei who established thisorganization around these goals were accused by other evacuees in thecamp, comprised mainly of Issei and Kibei, of proposing such anorganization merely for their personal gain. Opposition developed at thefirst meeting, coalescing around the general theme &#151; "We do notneed a Citizens' Federation or self-government. The government put usbehind barbed wire, let it take care of us."</P><P>Personality clashes entered into the struggle for leadership of thecamp's community government. At the first meeting of the federation, thearguments between individuals quickly became a clash "over records andpast performances of these individuals."</P><P>In the aftermath of this meeting, Joseph Kurihara emerged as anemotional leader of the opposition to Nisei ideals, goals, andorganizational framework. He quickly began efforts to establish a"counter organization called the Manzanar Relocation Center Federation."According to the proposed constitution for this federation, its purposewas to "act in accordance with the Constitution of the United States,and strive with the united efforts for the preservation of the RealDemocratic principles." The federation would "act in the capacity ofintermediary in carrying out instructions of the authorities to avoidmisunderstanding and complexity among the Issei, Nisei, and Kibeigroups." Membership in the federation would be "open, withoutrestriction upon recommendation by fellow residents" and approval by the"Membership Board." Membership fees would be 25 cents a year, the fundto be under the "sole jurisdiction and control of the officers," and theproceeds to be "used to defray administrative expenses of thefederation."</P><P>On September 4, WRA Administrative Procedure No. 34 arrived atManzanar from Washington, containing regulations for the establishmentof community government in the relocation centers. The "bombshell" inthe document was that "only citizens could hold elective offices in anycenter." The Japanese American Citizens' League had thus won its battle,since enforcement of the procedure would place Nisei in control ofcenter community government.</P><P>Administrative Procedure No. 34 directed the individual projectdirectors to appoint a commission to draw up a charter for communitygovernment, the items that the WRA required in the charter beingenumerated in the document. The entire center population would then beasked to vote on the acceptance of the charter.</P><P>In accordance with the directive, Project Director Nash appointed acommission to draw up a charter for Manzanar. Essentially, the membersof the commission were leaders of the Manzanar Citizens' Federation.After they drew up a preliminary charter as directed by the WRA, astruggle between Nisei and Issei erupted over voting on the charter.Dates for the election were set and postponed twice, as the evacueepopulation in the center came "to a fine pitch of excitement" over theissue.</P><P>According to Brown and Merritt, the state of confusion in the centerbegan "catching in the ranks of the members" of the WRA appointedpersonnel. The chief of community services and the employment officerwere the first to "break openly and denounce each other in a staffmeeting." The chief engineer, never very sympathetic with the evacuees,was the subject of a number of attacks in written memoranda by key WRAstaff. This discord between members of the staff was "immediately pickedup by evacuees and used to point out in evacuee circles theineffectiveness of federal management."</P><P>Two orders by center management during the late summer causedconsiderable unrest among the evacuee population. The first was an orderfor all persons to move out of Blocks 1 and 7, the first to be usedexclusively for administrative offices and the latter to be used forschools. At first, the residents, led by a group of openly identified"anti-administration" evacuees, refused to move from their quarters,arguing that the government had sufficient money to build schools andoffice buildings. Because schools were important to many evacuees, theresidents of Block 7 "eventually gave in to pressure and moved."However, the residents of Block 1, composed primarily of bachelors,staged "what amounted to a sit-down strike which occasioned several'ultimatums' by the management, the last one of which was obeyed but notwithout a great deal of resentment."</P><P>The second instance "of bungling on the part of the administrationwas a hurriedly written bulletin by the Project Director" following ameeting held by the Kibei in the mess hall of Block 15 on August 8. Atthe meeting, anti-administration voices roundly denounced the WRAadministrators and the federal government in Japanese. Incensed by themeeting, Project Director Nash issued Director's Bulletin No. 16 statingthat "no more public meetings will be permitted where Japanese is spokenas the principal language."</P><P>Anti-administration forces were quick to point out that this ordercanceled the inherent right of free speech in America guaranteed by theBill of Rights. Furthermore, they used the bulletin as evidence that theadministration was not in sympathy with problems facing the evacuees,and that the tone of the notice clearly demonstrated that Manzanar "wasa prison camp, not a Relocation Center."</P><P>During this period, tensions mounted among the block managers. InAugust, for instance, the first block manager resigned after having madea fiery speech against the administration in which he asked, among otherthings, who was to pocket a supposed $14,000 profit from the camp'scanteen/general store and who authorized a printing bill of $2,000which, it was rumored, was the price paid to print the script. He urgedthe people not to move from Block 7 for schools, and concluded byclaiming that his American citizenship was meaningless and that hewanted nothing to do with America. This first open rift in the blockmanagers touched off "a series of accusations, recriminations, andresignations the next month or two." Soon, the chairman of the blockmanagers, who had at one time enjoyed considerable personal popularityin the camp, was attacked for immoral behavior. Although he scoffed atthese charges at first, he later tendered his resignation, the groundsfor his resignation never being "completely clarified in any of themeetings."</P><P>According to Brown and Merritt, the first signs of nationalisticsentiments at Manzanar began to be noticed during the summer monthsfollowing an announcement by Washington on July 20 that Kibei would notbe allowed to leave the camp on work furloughs. Many of the Kibei, theiremotions "taut because of conflicts of language, ideologies, and livingpatterns," felt that the order keeping them in the center, even thoughthey were American citizens, was "a great act of discrimination."</P><P>Led by "anti-administration" leaders, many Kibei openly denouncedtheir American citizenship and pledged their allegiance to Japan at apublic meeting in early August. Tokie Slocum also attended the meetingand openly boasted of being an FBI informant. After this declaration,Slocum found it necessary to hustle out of the meeting for his ownprotection. The meeting became so boisterous that WRA staff membersintervened and asked for adjournment. Such pronouncements presented anopportunity for many Nisei, who had ambitions to control the communitygovernment of the center, to point out that there was a large element of"dangerous pro-Japanese forces" in the camp "whose avowed purpose was tosmash any constructive program of the administration and make the camp a"prison camp for Japs." The "pro-Japanese" or "anti-administration"group, on the other hand, claimed that many Nisei were "dogs, stooges,and informers" because of their positions in offices and their closeassociation with WRA staff members.</P><P>Evidence of a rising underground movement began to surface asbulletins appeared in the mess halls and latrines signed by the "BloodBrothers" and the "Black Dragon Society." The first attacks were leveledagainst the community government program, but soon they switched totirades against the camouflage net project. Other targets included theManzanar Cooperative ("an obvious plot to impoverish us Japanese"), theeducation program ("We don't need a useless American education"), andfurlough work in the sugar beet fields of the western states ("the whiteman told us to get out of California; now they want to use us aseconomic serfs. Do not go on furlough.")</P><P>Amid the struggle for power in the camp, the Kitchen Workers' Unionwas established in late September under the leadership of Harry Ueno. As"his bargaining weapon," Brown and Merritt observed that Ueno"manufactured out of wholecloth, without any basis of fact, that theadministration was stealing sugar which belonged to the evacuees and wasselling it outside at black market prices." Ueno was "able to stir up agreat deal of excitement among the evacuees, but was unable to use thisto any advantage with the administration." Ueno managed, however, "toget himself thoroughly disliked by the then Assistant Project Manager[Ned Campbell] who, on several occasions, threatened to throw theorganizer bodily from the room."</P><P>Failing "to gain a point in having his union recognized and alsofailing to have his union members go on strike because of the sugar,"Ueno, according to Brown and Merritt, "joined forces with the"pro-Japanese" group," which had rallied around the leadership of JosephKurihara. The names of Campbell and Chief Steward Joseph Winchester werethus added "to the list of 'dogs, stooges, and informers, who, by thistime, were going to be 'liquidated' by the people."</P><P>Harvey M. Coverley, the new Acting Project Director, sensed theseriousness of the charges posed by Ueno. Accordingly, he launched aninvestigation of the sugar controversy and presented his findings to theblock managers. These men, for the most part, accepted theadministration's findings that the charges were baseless and transmittedthe information to the residents of their blocks. By this time, however,"it was too late to kill the old antagonism between the organization ofthe Kitchen Workers and the administration, particularly certainindividuals in the administration."</P><P>In this state of turmoil, Roy Nash, who had served as projectdirector of Manzanar since the WRA had assumed administrative control ofthe camp on June 1, resigned to "take up new duties in South America."For the next six weeks, the center was administered by two differentacting project directors, Coverley and Solon T. Kimball, sent from theregional office in San Francisco.</P><P>On November 24, Ralph P. Merritt, who had been chairman of theInyo-Mono Associates and of the initial Citizens Committee in the OwensValley appointed by Thomas dark in March, arrived from his ranch inNevada to serve as project director. Although associated with theestablishment of the camp, he had been away from the area for more thansix months and "was not aware of the manifold conflicts which hadbrought the management and evacuees to an exploding point." A number ofstaff members, however, sensed the "potential powder barrel, and, in aseries of early conferences" with Merritt "attempted to outline thesituation as it stood at that time."</P><P>On his first day on duty at Manzanar, Merritt wrote that he was"greeted by a staff meeting with all the courtesy and curiosity whichusually attends such occasions." Beneath "the veneer of the pleasantriesof those first greetings," however, he sensed a "tenseness that camefrom misunderstandings, lack of leadership, and frustrations." Becauseof insufficient housing at Manzanar, much of the staff lived inIndependence and Lone Pine. Merritt observed that it "was obviously aproblem of first importance to build sufficient housing on the Center sothe staff members might develop a better understanding of their problemsand better relationships with each other and the evacuees whom theyserved."</P><P>The next day, Merritt attended a meeting in Town Hall in which thecharter for community government was discussed. The Nisei "tactfullyexplained that the basic principles of the charter were the result ofthe planning of the Washington staff of WRA." The Issei, on the otherhand, "were solidly in opposition to the adoption of any form ofgovernment which would rob them of power and prestige, and theopportunity to participate in the government affairs of the community."Merritt's attention was caught by the statement of one impassionedspeaker; "Look out the window and what do you see? There is barbed wire,there is a watch tower, and there is a soldier who guards us by day andnight and shoots us if we break the law. Because it is calledself-government and we have no self-government, I move that: the damnedcharter be thrown out the window." The motion was passed unanimously.Merritt observed that he vaguely "began to understand that the problemof first importance with the evacuees was the creation of a method ofCenter administration that would create, rather than destroy, mutualconfidence." Less than two weeks later, these tensions would result inviolence.
