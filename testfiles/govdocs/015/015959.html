Policymakers in this country have long embraced universal service as a broad and purposeful goal. Throughout this century,
the number and proportion of U.S. households with telephones have increased steadily as "plain old telephone service" (POTS)
has come within the economic reach of most Americans (see AT&amp;T, 1982; Belinfante, 1998; FCC, 1997; Lande, 1993).
Developed within the structure of franchised local exchange monopolies, the policy flourished through the workings of a
system that featured wide-ranging subsidies and noncost based telephone rates (see, <EM>e.g.</EM>, Weinhaus et al., 1992). For much of
this century, this arrangement has stood as the legacy of the Bell System's Theodore Vail and the Communications Act of 1934
(see, e.g<EM>.</EM>, Bolter et al., 1990).</FONT><br>

<br>
In recognition of a profoundly new era based on telecommunications and computers, the Clinton Administration launched the
National Information Infrastructure (NII) initiative. On September 15, 1993, the Administration's Information Infrastructure
Task Force (IITF, 1993) issued the NII <EM>Agenda for Action</EM>, a policy blueprint that sets forth nine major principles and goals for
government activity. One of those principles is to "extend the 'universal service concept' to ensure that information resources
are available to all at affordable prices" (p. 6). More specifically, the <EM>Agenda for Action</EM> directed the Commerce Department's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to conduct universal service hearings around the
country. The Administration's vision statement also instructed the Commerce-chaired IITF to work with the NII Advisory
Council, as well as state regulatory commissions, in determining a universal service concept for the 21st century. This chapter
discusses: (a) the results achieved by universal service and related policies in this country and (b) how federal actions are
helping to expand this traditional concept from dial tone for households to basic information technology access for all
Americans.</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>TRADITIONAL UNIVERSAL SERVICE</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
Progress toward the universal service goal is generally measured by the metric "telephone penetration," which in its most
widely used form represents the percentage of inhabitants or households that have a telephone on premises. Using this basis,
the United States has achieved some important successes. For example, comparing main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants
using 1996 data, the United States (64.0) leads Canada (60.2), France (56.4), Germany (53.8), the United Kingdom (52.8),
Japan (48.9), and Italy (44.0) among the group of seven countries and trails only Sweden (68.2) and Switzerland (64.0) among
all major industrialized nations (International Telecommunication Union [ITU], 1998). And the U.S. growth in main lines per
100 (17.3%) has been more robust than that of Sweden (-.1%) and exceeded only by Germany (34.0%) and the U.K. (19.4%)
among "G-7" nations during the 1990s (ITU, 1998). Since the breakup of AT&amp;T's Bell System in 1984, the average annual
percentage of U.S. households without telephones has declined by about one fourth (-24.3%), whereas the total number of
households in this country increased by almost one fifth (19.5%) to a total of 102 million (Belinfante, 1998).</FONT><br>

<br>
A closer examination, however, reveals that important groups or geographic areas exhibit telephone penetration rates that
significantly lag behind the national average. For example, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona, only 28% of
households currently subscribe to telephone service (USDA, 1997). In determining that 94.8% of U.S. households had at least
one telephone, the 1990 U.S. decennial census also found that those less likely to have a telephone included the following types
of households (HHs): American Indians (76.8% penetration rate; 47.0% on reservations); those with incomes under $5,000
(77.0%); single-parent homes headed by a female (84.3%); HH head under 25 years of age (84.7%); mobile home occupants
(86.9%); households numbering seven or more persons (88.1%); renters (89.3%); those living in nonmetropolitan areas
(91.3%); and female HH head (93.5%; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994b).</FONT><br>

<br>
Subsequent studies by NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), using special Census survey data, add to
this profile. For example, NTIA's <EM>Falling through the net</EM> (McConnaughey, Nila, &amp; Sloan, 1995) analysis highlighted that the
phoneless are particularly concentrated in rural areas and central cities; in fact, central cities in the northeast registered the
lowest penetration rates, followed closely by central cities and rural areas in the south. The less educated also are increasingly
likely to be without telephones. The Commission found that the southwest and south generally lag behind the rest of the United
States, with the nation's lowest 1997 average penetration rates in New Mexico (88.1%), Arkansas (89.8%), and Mississippi
(89.2%), well behind the national average of 93.9%. Both the FCC and NTIA documented that Black and Hispanic households
exhibit relatively low penetration as well (Belinfante, 1998; see also Schement, Belinfante, &amp; Povich, 1994; Wilhelm, 1996).</FONT><br>

<br>
Why does phonelessness occur? Much work needs to be done, but some important research to date indicates several key factors
at play. Some people may eschew having a telephone because they simply do not desire it. For example, in research done by
the University of Texas (Horrigan &amp; Rhodes, 1995), 5% of the respondents in a survey of 172 Texans without telephones
stated that they did not want or need telephone service. Based on a study of a New Jersey city by two Rutgers University
researchers (Mueller &amp; Schement, 1995), many inner-city households apparently prefer cable television service to telephone
service. Reasons include: (a) the perceivedly uncontrollable costs of phone service; (b) telephones could permit undesirable
interactions relating to drugs and crime; and (c) phones would allow calls pertaining to bill collection or other "threatening"
matters (Muller &amp; Schement, 1995). In contrast, cable is seen as inexpensive, satisfying entertainment that can keep children
off dangerous streets and represents a "visible sign of well-being" (Mueller &amp; Schement, 1995). Nationwide, the incidence of
those who will not receive telephone service regardless of its availability is likely to be small--less than 1% of total
households (Schement <EM>et al.</EM>, 1994).</FONT><br>

<br>
Others may not have a phone because of language barriers. A witness testified during NTIA field hearings held in South
Central Los Angeles, on February 16, 1994, that, based on a 1992 survey, more than 40% of Chinese, Korean, and Latino
consumers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Brownsville, Texas, experienced difficulties in beginning
the process of getting a phone installed (NTIA, 1994a).</FONT><br>

<br>
Affordability of telephone service appears to be a very significant factor. Interestingly, recent studies (see C&amp;P Telephone
Company, 1993; Field Research Corporation, 1993; Horrigan &amp; Rhodes, 1995; Mueller &amp; Schement, 1995; Southwestern Bell
Telephone, 1986) point to an inability to control long-distance calling as a key determinant that, overall, is apparently more
important than the current cost of local service, including basic monthly service rates and installation charges. Past outstanding
bills, including the cost of reinstallation, also seem to pose a substantial barrier to phone service for many of today's phoneless
(see, <EM>e.g.</EM>, Horrigan &amp; Rhodes, 1995).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>UNIVERSAL SERVICE IN THE INFORMATION AGE</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
The information marketplace is substantial and growing. NTIA estimates that information and telecommunications equipment
and services generate more than three quarters of a $1 trillion in revenue annually in the United States and may comprise 17%
of this country's gross domestic product by the early 21st century (Irving, 1997). With private investment in such infrastructure
as the catalyst, the resulting technological innovations and wider access will boost U.S. global competitiveness through higher
productivity and new products and services. Expected economic benefits include the creation of high-skilled and better paying
jobs, economic growth, and an increased standard of living for Americans. Important social benefits would arise from greater
educational opportunities such as distance learning, expanded medical applications through telemedicine linkage of remote
locations with big-city hospitals, and community empowerment (see IITF, 1993; Secretary of Commerce Brown, 1995).</FONT><br>

<br>
Clearly, information is increasingly impacting U.S. lives, and many will be favorably affected. However, there is a serious
concern about how others will fare--the so-called information poor. Indeed, those already disadvantaged persons who do not
participate in the information revolution will fall even further behind the mainstream in terms of their economic well-being.
The Clinton Administration seeks to ensure that such widening gaps between information "haves" and "have nots" do not
occur (IITF, 1993).</FONT><br>

<br>
A fundamental goal of this Administration is to expand the universal service concept to ensure that information resources are
available to all at affordable prices (IITF, 1993). This applies both to households that are not currently connected to the NII,
and to public institutions that are traditionally providers of information access to the general public. Both President Bill Clinton
(1994, 1996, 1997, 1998) and Vice President Al Gore (1994, 1998) believe that public policymakers should work with the
private sector to connect every classroom, library, hospital, and clinic in America to the NII by the year 2000.</FONT><br>

<br>
Ideally, all households that desire access to the NII should be able to achieve it, particularly those persons who would
otherwise be information poor. This should remain a long-term national strategy. To advance the goal of universal service in
the interim, transitional arrangements need to be made utilizing appropriate institutions as public safety nets.</FONT><br>

<br>
Where do households and institutions such as public schools and libraries stand in terms of information access? As measured
by such gauges as penetration of telephones, personal computers (PCs) and modems, and online access, progress has been
made in recent years but much more is needed. With respect to households and their access to phones, the previous section
discussed the impressive aggregate numbers but concurrent deficiencies within certain groups and geographic areas. Not
unexpectedly, the PC and modem penetration levels are much lower: among all U.S. households, 36.6% possess a PC and
26.3% have modems, up from 25.5% and 11.0% in 1994. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994a; 1997). Similar to telephones,
aggregate figures mask the fact that some groups and areas lag substantially behind others. Thus, information have nots are
disproportionately found in rural locales and central cities (McConnaughey et al<EM>.</EM>, 1995).</FONT><br>

<br>
More specifically, the rural poor, followed by low-income households in central cities, have the lowest PC and modem
penetration rates (McConnaughey et al., 1995). Senior citizens and the youngest household heads (25 years or younger), as
well as Blacks and Hispanics in central cities and particularly rural areas, are also deficient in this regard (McConnaughey et
al., 1995). For a given level of education, central city households registered the lowest PC penetration, whereas in rural
locations generally the relative incidence of modems trailed all others (McConnaughey et al., 1995). As was the case with
telephones, the Northeast's central cities claimed the lowest PC penetration, whereas modem possession ranked lowest among
PC users in the rural west, midwest, and south (McConnaughey et al., 1995). Recent evidence has been collected (Katz &amp;
Aspden, 1997) that household Internet usage has been characterized by a large dropout rate, particularly among the young, less
affluent, and the less educated. Presumably, the high cost relative to one's income level, perceived lack of user friendliness,
and the absence of an online "killer" application have hampered the spread of PCs and electronic access, but research is needed
to determine more definitively the causes.</FONT><br>

<br>
Public institutions such as schools and libraries have exhibited a pattern of penetration similar to households: progress over
time but room for significant improvement. At public schools, telephones typically are located in and around administrative
offices but generally reach only about 12% of the classrooms (National Education Association and Princeton Survey Research
Associates, 1993). Although the percentage of students per personal computer has improved tenfold over the past decade,
online access to the Internet or other wide area networks appears to be suboptimal (Quality Education Data, Inc., 1995).
Overall, 78% of public schools and only 27% of all instructional rooms (classrooms, labs, and media centers) are connected to
the Internet (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 1998). Some important demographic-based distinctions do exist.
For example, schools with low minority enrollment (less than 6%) feature Internet access in 37% of their instructional rooms,
compared to 13% in predominantly minority (50% or more) schools (NCES, 1997). Less pronounced is the access differential
between instructional rooms in rural (30%) and city schools (20%; NCES, 1998). Concerning Internet capabilities, teachers
have greater access to the World Wide Web (www; 94%) and particularly email (88%) than do students (74 and 35%,
respectively) at public schools (NCES, 1997).</FONT><br>

<br>
Virtually 100% of public libraries appear to have at least one telephone on premise, albeit almost two thirds (63%) have five or
less (National Commission on Libraries and Information Science [NCLIS], 1994). Concerning urban libraries, 85% are
characterized by 10 or more phone lines, whereas 79% of rural libraries have one to five lines. Of greater concern to
policymakers is that more than one third (37%) of public libraries do not own computers (NCLIS, 1994). Although 63% of
public libraries possess one or more computers, only a little more than 6% exceed 10 in number (NCLIS, 1994). Regarding
computers with external communications capability, 72% of all public libraries are connected to the Internet (NCLIS, 1997b).
For those libraries that do have Internet access, only 60% provide public access terminals (NCLIS, 1997b). Substantially
higher proportion of urban libraries are hooked up to the Internet than their rural counterparts serving populations of less than
5,000 (66%), (NCLIS, 1997b). Although the highest percentage of public access to graphical WWW is found in rural areas
(32% of connected libraries), these same areas also possess the highest proportion of main/central libraries with public access
to those interfaces (17.2%; NCLIS, 1997b).</FONT><br>

<br>
These institutions have inadequate communications capabilities for several reasons. With respect to telephones, budgetary
factors and (in the case of schools) teacher attitudes appear to be important (Office of Technology Assessment, 1995). Multiple
barriers prevent schools and libraries from adequately accessing the NII (e.g., the Internet). The most important reasons that
schools cite as to why they do not have or use advanced communications include limited funding, too few access points in the
building, lack of or poor equipment, and not easily accessible telecommunications equipment or "links" (National Center for
Education Statistics, 1997a).</FONT><br>

<br>
For libraries, important factors center on cost considerations, the availability of state money, library staff's time and technical
expertise, and federal money. For urban libraries, system/server costs, communications costs, and staff time are most critical.
Internet access by rural libraries also hinges most importantly on these two types of costs, followed by state money, software
costs, staff time, and in-house technical expertise (NCLIS, 1997a).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
The Administration has undertaken a number of activities under the aegis of the IITF and the NII initiative that are designed to
preserve and advance universal service. Simply stated, these activities collectively seek to avoid creating a society of
information haves and have nots.</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Universal Service Hearings</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
As the chair of the IITF Telecommunications Policy Committee (TPC) and its Working Group on Universal Service,
NTIA--led by its Administrator, Larry Irving--cosponsored with several state governments five universal service field
hearings in different parts of the country during 1993 and 1994. Featuring 230 witnesses and 1,400 pages of transcript, the
hearings sought to determine how the concept of universal service can be made more consistent with the needs of Americans
today and in the 21st century. In September 1994, NTIA released <EM>America Speaks Out</EM>, a report that identifies major themes of
these hearings, including most fundamentally that government has an important role to play in ensuring that the goals of
universal service are accomplished in a multiprovider environment (NTIA, 1994b).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Notice of Inquiry</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
In September, 1994, NTIA also issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on universal service and open access as part of a
comprehensive review of universal service and related issues in communications (NTIA, 1994a). The NOI reflects the current
debate regarding whether traditional notions of universal service--the widespread availability of "basic" telephone
service--are adequate to meet the needs of the American people. Information has emerged as a vital economic resource and
source of individual empowerment. Because technological changes are making telecommunications networks the highways of
the information age, businesses and individuals must be able to access and distribute essential information resources. In
addition, the emergence and expansion of competition is forcing the United States to reexamine traditional U.S. support
policies. Simultaneously, technological changes and the emergence of the Information Age are prompting a fresh look at the
way universal service is defined.</FONT><br>

<br>
Some 98 private or public sector entities, as well as individuals, submitted comments on the NOI. NTIA is drawing on the
record of this proceeding in developing analyses relating to several facets of the universal service issue.</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Electronic Conference</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
In November 1994, NTIA and the TPC held the first-ever conference in which the government has sought public input entirely
through electronic networks. The Administration produced this electronic or "virtual" conference to: (a) garner opinions and
views on universal service that may shape the legislative and regulatory debate; (b) demonstrate how networking technology
can broaden participation in the development of government policies, specifically, universal service policy; (c) illustrate the
potential for using the NII to create an electronic commons; and (d) create a network of individuals and institutions that will
continue the dialog started by the conference (Irving, 1994). More than 900 inputs from private locations and 78 public access
points in the United States produced comments on such topics as redefining universal service, availability/affordability, and
subscribership (including access for the disabled community; NTIA, 1994c).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Federal-State-Local Telecom Summit</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
On January 9, 1995, the Administration, led by Vice President Gore and the Commerce Department (with cosponsorship by the
Annenberg Washington Program), conducted an intergovernmental summit of telecommunications policymakers in
Washington, DC. Among the principles agreed to as a framework for discussion, two directly pertained to universal service.
The first emphasized the importance of affordable, just, and reasonable prices for access to basic telecommunications, whereas
the second stressed that telecommunications providers must contribute to the maintenance of universal service on an equitable
and competitively neutral basis (Gore, 1995). One year later, the new telecommunications reform act embraced both concepts.</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Household Penetration Study</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
Using November 1994 Current Population Survey data from the Census Bureau, NTIA developed a landmark subscribership
study of U.S. households called <EM>Falling through the net</EM> that the agency released in July 1995 (McConnaughey et al<EM>.</EM>, 1995). In
the case of telephones, personal computers, and online access, have nots are disproportionately represented in certain
geographic areas, such as rural designations and central cities in particular regions (e.g., northeast, south). As discussed, those
who are most likely to be information disadvantaged--yet enthusiastic users, once online--are found among the poor,
minorities, young, and those who are less educated.</FONT><br>

<br>
In April 1998 Vice President Gore directed NTIA to conduct a study of the "digital divide" of internet and computer use
among races and income levels (Gore, 1998a). Soon thereafter, Commerce Department Assistant Secretary Irving announced
that "trendline" (1984-1997) analyses and a new expanded "Falling through the net" study would be undertaken during
1998-1999 (Irving, 1998).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Access for Schools, Libraries, and Health Care Providers</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
During mid-1995, NTIA issued <EM>Connecting the Nation: Classrooms, Libraries, and Health Care Organizations in the
Information Age</EM>, a review of the status of NII connectivity at public institutions (Gonzalez, 1995). The report highlighted that
as of 1994, Internet access numbered 35% of K-12 public schools, 21% of public libraries, and 22% of hospitals (Gonzalez,
1995). Overall, <EM>Connecting the Nation</EM> concluded that "much work" needs to be done before the Administration's goal of
connecting all classrooms, libraries, and health care organizations can be met (Gonzalez, 1995). As discussed below, important
progress has been achieved since that time.</FONT><br>

<br>
In February 1996, the Administration at the highest levels began promoting an educational technology initiative, called the
"Technology Literacy Challenge," whereby $2 billion in trust funds would be provided to state and local governments--which
would be encouraged to seek private matching funds--for permitting students and teachers to access and successfully use the
NII (see U.S. Department of Education, 1996). The "four pillars" of the Challenge initiative include:</FONT><br>

<br>
1.Modern computers and learning devices will be accessible to every student.</FONT><br>

2.Classrooms will be connected to one another and to the outside world.</FONT><br>

3.Educational software will be an integral part of the curriculum.</FONT><br>

4.Teachers will be ready to use and teach with technology. (See White House, 1997.)</FONT><br>

<br>
Other activities designed to assist schools are also underway. Federal agencies and the Lazarus Foundation are working to
implement the President's Executive Order directing that surplus government computers should go first to schools, with
priority for schools in "empowerment zones" (White House, 1996). In 1995, the private sector with a general endorsement by
the Administration established the "TECH CORPS," which marshals technical volunteers to train teachers in use of the NII.
Specifically, the mission of TECH CORPS is to bring and support volunteers from the technology community to advise and
assist schools with respect to new educational technologies. Assistance focuses on local planning, technical support and advice,
staff training, mentoring, and classroom interactions. Funded principally through corporate sponsorships, the nonprofit
organization currently operates 42 state chapters and one in the District of Columbia (TECH CORPS, 1998). In May 1996,
President Clinton announced the creation of 21st-Century Teachers, a nationwide voluntary program that encourages 100,000
teachers to mentor their colleagues to effectively use technology for teaching and learning. The initiative benefits from the
involvement of leading education groups and TECH CORPS, which have asked the nonprofit McGuffey Project to spearhead
the program (21st-Century Teachers Network, 1997).</FONT><br>

<br>
Reminiscent of the community barn-raising activities of a more agrarian economy, NetDay was launched as a voluntary
program to provide internal connections needed by schools to access the Internet. Inaugurated in California in March 1996, the
initiative brought together approximately 20,000 volunteers and 2,000 businesses to connect classrooms in 4,000 schools to the
Internet (on one day [March 9]). On June 29, 1996, Vice President Gore, NTIA, the Department of Education, and others
participated in the "NetDay 96 How To" conference in Washington, DC. More than 40 states held NetDays in 1996, many of
them on a national NetDay held on October 25 (Gore, 1997). On February 7, 1997, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and
NTIA Administrator Larry Irving encouraged business leaders to develop public-private partnerships with schools similar to
the Adopt-A-Highway program (Irving, 1997). Another national NetDay took place on April 19, 1997, and now virtually every
state has participated in the program (NetDay 2000, 1998).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Assisting Rural Access</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
In October 1995, NTIA released its <EM>Survey of Rural Information Infrastructure Technologies</EM>, which describes rural
information applications that make use of voice, computer, and video telecommunications services; and delineates various
wireline and wireless technologies that are or could be used to deliver these services to rural areas (NTIA, 1995). The report
concludes that: (a) there are a number of technologies suitable for providing voice grade services in rural areas; (b) it is
technically feasible to provide advanced computer and video capabilities in many such areas; and (c) there is currently no
technology, however, that can economically provide broadband capabilities to the "most isolated farms, ranches, and homes"
(NTIA, 1995).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Infrastructure Grants or Loans for Non-profit Institutions and Carriers</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
Some Administration activities related to the NII initiative, such as grants, serve to complement--but are not a part of--the
universal service system. Conceptually, they have different objectives: grants made, for example, under NTIA's new
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP) target myriad types of projects that serve as
innovative models for other entities to emulate, whereas the new universal service system is designed to provide funding for
discounted purchases of telecommunications services, Internet access, or internal connections by eligible schools, libraries, or
health care providers. NTIA provides matching grants to assist states, localities, universities and schools, hospitals, and other
public information and critical service providers to purchase equipment and undertake planning related to infrastructure
development. Since its inception in 1994, TIIAP has generated tremendous interest: more than 4,600 applications have been
received and 332 grants have been awarded in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several territories. These awards of some
$100 million in federal monies were supplemented by more than $150 million in nonfederal funds. A significant portion of the
funding went to rural regions or states. TIIAP projects serve as models that can be replicated in similar communities across the
country, thereby extending their benefits beyond the communities in which they take place (TIIAP, 1998).</FONT><br>

<br>
Rural Utilities Service (RUS), an agency within the Department of Agriculture, is a rural development agency that assists the
private sector in developing, planning, and financing the construction of telecommunications infrastructure in rural America.
RUS financing provides loans and some grant monies for carriers to build new networks and modernize existing ones, extend
service to unserved areas, and provide facilities for economic development, distance learning, telemedicine applications, and
Internet access. In 1995, the agency loaned $585 million to telephone companies that used the monies to provide initial
telecommunications services to 75,000 families, install 8,000 miles of fiber-optic facilities, and purchase nearly 200 new
digital switches (RUS, 1996).</FONT><br>

<br>
As part of the Technology Literacy Challenge initiative, the Department of Education provides two types of grants. One, the
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, provides formula grants to states to assist them in implementing statewide technology
plans for schools. Technology Innovation Challenge grants are designed to complement Literacy grants by generating new
learning applications and best practices that may be adapted successfully across the nation. Both are intended to be financial
means to help the nation meet the four pillars goals (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>National Subscribership Goal</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
NTIA recommends that the FCC set a national subscribership goal for the year 2000 (Brown, 1996; NTIA, 1996a).
Specifically, the goal should ensure that the telephone penetration level for all segments of society is equal to or above the
national average that existed as of November 1996. NTIA proposes that the Commission and the states work together to
increase subscribership, for example, by jointly exploring changes to the Link-Up program (which supports reduced-cost
installation of telephone service) to better serve the needs of low-income, highly mobile users. In addition, based on an
empirical study of disconnection and its effect on subscribership, the agency strongly urges that states bar local telephone
carriers from disconnecting local telephone service for nonpayment of interstate long-distance charges. As part of making
access more readily available to advanced telecommunications and information services, particularly during the interim period
before universal household connectivity is achieved, NTIA believes that schools, libraries, and other community access centers
should be expeditiously hooked up to the NII (NTIA, 1996a).</FONT><br>

<STRONG>The E-rate Proposal</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
At the aforementioned June 29 NetDay 96 conference, Vice President Gore announced his support for a proposal put forth by
U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley, Representative Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), and
others for free education or "E-rates" for a package of basic telecommunications services to schools and libraries. In addition, a
discounted rate for access to other services would be established. Vice President Gore stated that the E-rate plan would be
developed in such a way that: (a) services made available under the plan meet recognized educational objectives, including the
need for adequate bandwidth; (b) all competitors have access to the universal service fund subsidies to serve schools and
libraries; (c) the subsidies are technology-neutral; and (d) there is a dynamic and open process for defining the services and
packages using advice and counsel from all groups that have a stake in the future of the U.S. educational system (see Gore,
1996).</FONT><br>

<br>
Subsequently, the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Education urged the FCC to "support a guarantee of universal
access to advanced telecommunications and information service for every public, private, and parochial school and library in
America" (Cabinet, 1996, p. 1). NTIA's companion filing on behalf of the Administration elaborated on the Vice President's
E-rate principles, arguing for a system of market-based incentives and universally available telecommunications and
information services. Features would include competitive bidding intended to assure a best value combination of price and
functionality; tiered discounts tied to economic disadvantage; a procurement process that integrates purchasing decisions,
technology plans, and curricula; and regular triennial reviews by the Joint Board and the FCC (NTIA, 1996b). Complements to
the E-rate approach would be aggregation of demand through buying coalitions, donations of new or surplus equipment or
software, and volunteer activities such as NetDay, training, and technical assistance (NTIA, 1996b).</FONT><br>

<br>
As the implementation process has proceeded, the Administration has continued its strong support for this program of assisting
eligible schools, libraries, and health care providers to participate in the Information Age (Gore, May 1998; Clinton, June
1998).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>THE NEW RULES OF THE ROAD</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Legislative</STRONG></FONT><br>
<br>
In 1996, Congress, working with the Administration and a variety of public and private sector interests, adopted for the first
time since 1934 comprehensive legislation that establishes a policymaking framework for the emerging information age. On
February 1, 1996, the House and Senate overwhelmingly adopted telecom reform legislation. The final version of the bill (S.
652) was approved in the House 414-16, and 91-5 in the Senate. On February 8, President Clinton signed into law the
<EM>Telecommunications Act of 1996</EM> (Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, codified at 47 U.S.C. §). The President and the Vice
President commended the tremendous bi-partisan effort that led to passage of the bill (Clinton, February 1996; Gore, February
1996).</FONT><br>

<br>
Congress made history when it codified universal service as an explicit nationwide policy. Section 254 of the Act defines
<EM>universal</EM> <EM>service</EM> as an "evolving level of telecommunications services that the [FCC] shall establish &lt;@133&gt; taking into
account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services" (§ 254(c)(1)). The Act directed the
Commission to institute a Federal-State Joint Board to develop recommendations on defining and funding universal service,
and enumerates several principles (such as nature of access, service quality, and affordable rates) to guide the deliberations.
The Joint Board would submit its recommendations to the FCC by November 8, 1996, and the Commission in turn would issue
its final rules by no later than May 8, 1997 (§ 254(a)(1),(2)).</FONT><br>

<br>
In developing a list of the telecommunications services that would be supported by federal funding mechanisms, the Act
requires policymakers to consider the extent to which services are: (a) essential to education, public health, or public safety; (b)
subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers through a market process; (c) being deployed in public telecom
networks by carriers; and (d) consistent with the public interest (§ 251(c)(1)).</FONT><br>

<br>
As a general proposition, the 1996 Telecommunications Act mandates that communications be made available to all people of
the United States without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (§ 104). In addition, it
seeks through the so-called Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey provision (named after its Senate sponsors) to ensure that schools
and libraries (and rural health care providers) become connected to the NII through preferential rates for universal services as
defined by the FCC (§ 254(h)). Moreover, the Act empowers the FCC to designate "special [universal] services" for these
institutions (§ 254(c)(3)). Other targeted recipients of support are low-income consumers and those in rural and high cost areas
(§ 254(b)(3)). Regarding those that will pay into the system, every telecom carrier that provides interstate and intrastate
telecom services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient
mechanisms established by the FCC and the states to preserve and advance universal service (§ 254(d),(f)).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>Regulatory</STRONG></FONT><br>
<br>
Charged with implementing these broad directives, regulators have expended enormous energy to provide detailed guidelines
and rules for the new universal service policy. On May 8, 1997, the FCC issued a landmark decision regarding universal
service--the availability and affordability of telecommunications service for all Americans (Federal-State Joint Board on
Universal Service, <EM>Report and Order</EM>, CC Docket No. 96-45, FCC 97-157, rel. May 8, 1997). As directed by the Act, a special
Universal Service Joint Board comprised of federal and state regulators and a consumer advocate developed specific
recommendations for the FCC with respect to the definition of services that are supported by a federal universal service
funding mechanism. Relying heavily on the Joint Board's November 8, 1996, <EM>Recommended Decision</EM>, the FCC released a
<EM>Report and Order</EM> that undertakes to modernize universal service policy in an increasingly competitive marketplace and to
fundamentally expand its applicability.</FONT><br>

<br>
Looking to the Act for guidance, the FCC issued rules based on the following goals:</FONT><br>
<br>
1. All of the universal service objectives established by the Act must be implemented, including those for low-income
individuals; consumers in rural, insular, and high cost areas; as well as for schools, libraries, and rural health care providers.</FONT><br>

2. Rates for basic service must be maintained at affordable levels for residences.</FONT><br>

3. Affordable basic phone service must continue to be available to all users with the help of a universal service fund that will
subsidize phone service for those who qualify.</FONT><br>

4. The benefits of competition in the telecommunications arena must be brought to as many consumers as possible.</FONT><br>

<br>
The Commission specifically defined services for households that will be supported by the fund. These include:</FONT><br>
<br>
1.Access to a telephone network with the ability to place and receive calls.</FONT><br>

2.Access to touch-tone capability.</FONT><br>

3.Single-party service.</FONT><br>

4.Access to emergency systems including, where available, 911 and Enhanced 911.</FONT><br>

5.Access to operator services.</FONT><br>

6.Access to interexchange services.</FONT><br>

7.Access to directory assistance.</FONT><br>

8.(For those low-income users who qualify) limited long-distance calling.</FONT><br>
<br>
The Commission also issued its findings and conclusions with respect to support for rural and high-cost areas, low-income
households, schools and libraries, and health care providers (especially rural). Each of these is discussed here in summary fashion.</FONT><br>
<br>
<EM>Rural and High-Cost Areas</EM>. Traditionally, universal service has been achieved primarily through implicit subsidies designed to
shift costs from rural to urban areas, residential to business customers, and local to long-distance service. Some explicit support
mechanisms have been employed in high-cost areas and for low-income users for a number of years. Through changes in
universal service and interstate access charges, the FCC will convert existing federal support to an explicit, competitively
neutral, and sustainable mechanism as of January 1, 1999 for nonrural carriers. It is intended that costs will be developed
through models using forward-looking methodologies. A rural task force appointed by the Universal Service Joint Board will
examine the feasibility of developing forward-looking costs for rural carriers. It is anticipated that the total amount of support
from the new high-cost fund will likely not decline materially but will be restructured to better fit a competitive environment.</FONT><br>

<br>
<EM></EM></FONT><EM>Low-Income Support for Households</EM>. In its May 1997 decision, the FCC concluded that the Lifeline Assistance program,
which is designed to mitigate the cost of monthly phone bills, must be offered to qualifying low-income consumers by all
eligible telecommunications carriers. In addition, all states are required to provide this service to its consumers.</FONT><br>

<br>
The new Lifeline programs are scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1998. For the first time, Lifeline participants will
receive an extra $1.75 a month over the $3.50 that Lifeline currently contributes, totaling $5.25 in federal support even if the
state provides no funds from the intrastate jurisdiction. In addition, Lifeline will provide matching funds equal to half of the
funds generated from the intrastate jurisdiction, up to $7.00 a month in federal support. If a state provides the minimum
amount ($3.50 per month) required to elicit the full federal support, the total monthly Lifeline contribution to a reduction in
end-user charges could rise from $7.00 under the current system to $10.50 under this new regime.</FONT><br>

<br>
In addition to services that meet the definition of &gt;universal service, Lifeline customers are also allowed to receive toll-limitation service free of charge in areas that this capability is offered. That means that a monthly limit can be set on the
amount of money spent on long-distance calling, and if the long-distance bills are not paid, then only the long-distance service,
and not the local service, would be cut off until the long distance bill is paid.</FONT><br>

<br>
In states that provide intrastate support, the eligibility for Lifeline is currently determined by state agencies or telephone
companies; this will continue. In states that do not provide intrastate support, however, the default Lifeline eligibility standard
will be participation in Medicaid, food stamps, Supplementary Social Security Income, federal public housing assistance, or
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. States may choose other criteria, but they must be based solely upon the
income of the candidates. These qualifications also apply to Link-Up America, the federal program designed to support the
installation of phone lines in homes.</FONT><br>

<br>
<EM></EM></FONT><EM>Assistance for Schools and Libraries</EM>. Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, public and nonprofit schools and libraries will
be eligible as of January 1, 1998, for discounts applicable to three broad categories of offerings. First, these institutions can
procure any telecommunications service on a subsidized basis. Second, support may be received for Internet access. Finally,
these discounts can apply to internal networking that is necessary to connect school or library terminals to the Internet. The
discounts also cover expenditures for networking hubs, routers, network file servers and server software, and maintenance of
network systems. Personal computers, fax machines, modems, and asbestos removal, however, are specifically excluded
because they are not considered necessary to transmit information. Training, nonnetwork software, voice mail or information
services in general, electrical connections, and security are also not eligible for support.</FONT><br>

<br>
To receive a discount, applying schools and libraries must seek competitive bids for the eligible services. Price should be the
primary factor in accepting a bid, but other factors may be included such as prior experience, personnel qualifications,
management capability, and environmental objectives.</FONT><br>

<br>
The subsidy for authorized services and equipment will be based on whether the school or library is located in a rural or high-cost area as well as the percent of students in the district who are eligible for the national school lunch program that provides
free or reduced cost lunches for needy students. Similarly, a library's level of poverty should be calculated on the basis of
school lunch eligibility in the public school district in which the library is located. The matrix of discounts developed by the
FCC based on the school lunch program and the rural or urban nature of a given school or library ranges from 20% to 90%.</FONT><br>

<br>
For eligible schools ordering subsidized products or services, the procurement officer for each school district or state applicant
is required to certify to the FCC the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program. For libraries ordering
equipment or services at the library system level, discounts should be computed on an individual branch basis or based on an
average of all branches within the system. Where aggregation occurs, the state, district, or system should strive to ensure that
each school or library receives the full benefit of the discount to which it is entitled.</FONT><br>

Each year, there will be a $2.25 billion cap on universal service support for schools and libraries. Initially, the FCC ruled that
funds would be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, until there is $250 million left in the fund, at which point those
schools and libraries that are most economically disadvantaged will be provided funds before others. If the annual cap is not
reached in a given year, the unspent funds will be available to support discounts in subsequent years. The Commission
subsequently ordered revised rules of priority to ensure that most disadvantaged schools and libraries will receive priority
support (Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, <EM>Fifth Order</EM> on <EM>Reconsideration and Fourth Report and Order</EM>, cc
Docket No. 96-45, rd. June 22, 1998.</FONT><br>

<br>
All K-12 schools, whether public or private that operate as a not-for-profit business and have an endowment of $50 million or
less are eligible for subsidies. Eligible libraries are as defined in the Library Services and Technology Act, as is "library
consortium" with the exception of "international cooperative association of library entities."</FONT><br>

<br>
To receive subsidies, schools and libraries must:</FONT><br>

1.Conduct internal assessments of the components necessary to use effectively the discounted services that they order,
including specific plans for using these technologies and integrating them into the curriculum, and receive independent
approval of the technology plan, ideally by a state agency that regulates schools and libraries.</FONT><br>

2.Submit a complete description of the services that they seek so that it may be posted for competing providers to evaluate.</FONT><br>

3.Certify that the school or library is an eligible entity, that the services will be used solely for educational purposes and will
not be resold, and that all necessary funding in the current budget year has been allocated to pay for the nonsubsidized portion
of the services.</FONT><br>

<br>
The subsidy is paid directly to the service provider who will then supply the services or equipment to the school or library at
the discounted rate.</FONT><br>

<br>
<EM></EM></FONT><EM>Assistance for Health Care Providers</EM>. Under new FCC rules, health care providers are eligible for universal service support of
up to 1.544 Mbps of bandwidth (e.g., T-1 service). This bandwidth may be achieved through any combination of frame relay,
ISDN, satellite, or other services whose sum does not exceed 1.544 Mbps. Subsidies will also be provided for any "toll" (long-distance) charges that might be incurred by connecting with an Internet service provider (ISP) who is located outside of the
local calling area. Customer premises equipment such as computers and modems are not supported.</FONT><br>

<br>
Rural health care providers are able to purchase services at rates no higher than that paid by urban providers for similar
services. As in the case of schools and libraries, the enabling subsidy is paid to the provider of communication services, who
will then provide those services at a discounted rate. The subsidy is calculated on the basis of the "standard urban
distance"--that is, the average of the longest diameters of all the cities of a population of 50,000 or more within the state.</FONT><br>

<br>
Health care providers are required to seek competitive bids for all eligible services by submitting bona fide requests for
services to the administrator. The requests shall be posted on the administrator's web site and contain information sufficient to
identify the requester and the services requested. The health care provider shall certify that the service chosen is the most cost-effective service available after selection of a telecommunications carrier. The health care provider need not select the lowest
bid and may take other considerations into account.</FONT><br>

<br>
To be eligible for these subsidies, the health care provider must be public or nonprofit and located in a rural area. More
specifically, eligible providers include: (a) teaching hospitals or medical schools; (b) community, migrant, or mental health
centers; (c) not-for-profit hospitals; (d) local health departments; (e) rural health clinics; and (f) consortia of the previous
entities.</FONT><br>

<br>
There is a $400 million annual cap on the amount of support given to rural health care providers. Collection and distribution of
funds began in 1998. Support will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis with the funding requests normally accepted
in July before each calendar funding year. In 1997, the timing of the first requests for funding will be a function of the
development of an application process for universal service support, which is expected to become available in the fall.</FONT><br>
<br>
When petitioning for support, all rural health care providers must give a statement to the carrier, signed by an officer of the
health care provider who is authorized to order telecommunications services, that certifies the following under oath:</FONT><br>
<br>
1.The requester is a public or nonprofit entity that falls within one of the seven categories set forth in the definition of health
care provider set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</FONT><br>

2.The requested service is supported under these regulations, and the requester is in a rural area or cannot obtain toll-free
access to an ISP.</FONT><br>

3.The services requested will be used solely for purposes reasonably related to the provision of health care services or
instruction that the health care provider is legally authorized to provide under the law of the state in which they are provided.</FONT><br>

4.The services will not be sold, resold, or transferred in consideration of money or any other thing of value.</FONT><br>

5.If the services are being purchased as part of an aggregated purchase with other entities or individuals, the full details of any
such arrangement governing the purchase, including the identities of all copurchasers and the portion of the services being
purchased by the health care must be provider.</FONT><br>

6.This is the lowest cost method of providing the requested services, taking into consideration the features, quality of
transmission, reliability, and other factors that the health care provider deems relevant to choosing an adequate method of
providing the required health care services.</FONT><br>

<br>
Eligible health care providers must file their contracts with the administrator either electronically or by paper. These providers
are required to file new funding requests for each new year. Multiyear contracts will be supported on a year-to-year basis, with
no lump sum funding permitted. Certifications must be renewed annually.</FONT><br>

<br>
Eligible health care providers participating in consortia that include (ineligible) private sector members would generally not
receive universal service support. The one permitted exception: eligibility would be recognized only if the consortium is
receiving tariffed rates, or market rates from those providers who do not file tariffs.</FONT><br>

<br>
Any public or nonprofit health care provider--regardless of location--who cannot obtain toll-free access to an ISP may obtain
either 30 hours of toll-free access or $180 of toll credits (whichever is reached first). Such support can be used to fund toll
charges but not distance-sensitive charges for a dedicated connection to an Internet service provider.</FONT><br>

<br>
<strong>Assessment</strong></FONT><br>
<br>
As in the case of the passage of major telecommunications legislation, the Administration vigorously participated in the CC
Docket 96-45 proceeding and provided leadership, in particular, on such issues as the E-rate and rural health care discounts, for
both their conceptualization and implementation. For 4 years, the Administration advocated meaningful telecommunications
policy reform that would promote competition, spur innovation, reduce prices, and preserve universal service, and "we are well
on our way to realizing these goals" with the Commission's adoption of universal service and access charge orders on May 8,
1997 (Secretary of Commerce Daley, 1997). The Vice President remarked that with the new E-rate mechanism, the "nation has
taken a great step forward in closing the gap between the information haves and have nots" (Gore, 1997). The Commission and
the Administration agreed on a number of critical elements in the new universal service system, with respect to the rationale
that the "most efficient use of the universal service support fund support system should be promoted through the use of market-based techniques wherever possible" (NTIA, 1996b). More specific features strongly supported by both include competitive
bidding, tiered discounts based on economic disadvantage, establishing a procurement process that integrates technology with
school curricula, and comparability of rural and urban rates for health care providers through toll-free access and distance
insensitivity (see Cabinet, 1996, 1997; NTIA, 1996a, 1996b, 1997a, 1997b). It is anticipated that the FCC's actions will have
wide-ranging beneficial effects on the future direction and prosperity of this country (Daley, 1997; Gore, 1997).</FONT><br>

<br>
<STRONG>SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS</STRONG></FONT><br>

<br>
A forward-looking universal service policy should reasonably seek to assure that all who desire access to the NII are able to
obtain it. An important part of this policy should be to assure provision of POTS to those households that want but cannot
currently subscribe to such service. However, equating universal service solely with telephone service appears to be
shortsighted in a society where an individual's economic and social well being depends increasingly on the ability to access,
accumulate, and assimilate information through means other than traditional POTS.</FONT><br>

<br>
A long-term strategy, then, should be to provide a means for electronic--such as Internet--access to all households that desire
a connection. In the interim period, schools, libraries, and other community access centers connected to the NII should be part
of the public safety net. In terms of connectivity for key institutions identified by the Administration and Congress, good
progress has been made. For example, during 1994-1997, the extent of Internet access grew significantly for public schools
(123%), public libraries (243%), and hospitals (greater than 127%). By 1996, approximately 78% of public schools, 72% of
libraries, and more than 50% of hospitals could claim access to the information superhighway. (See RUS, 1996).</FONT><br>

<br>
Partnerships--intergovernmental as well as those involving both the public and private sectors--should play a pivotal role in
designing and implementing a new universal service policy. For example, the aforementioned Federal-State-Local Summit
permitted the views of the three levels of government to be discussed and--where possible--harmonized, and these principles
were largely captured in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Administration's five field hearings, virtual conference,
and not all afforded a broad spectrum of interests to provide input at this critical policy-making juncture.</FONT><br>

<br>
As a complement to universal service, the TIIAP grant program has proven to be effective in extending the benefits of
advanced telecommunications technologies to millions of Americans in rural and underserved areas through matching grants
and public-private collaborations. Similarly, grants awarded by the Department of Education and Rural Utilities Service have
helped schools, libraries, and rural health care providers to meet the demands of the burgeoning Information Age. As directed
by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the FCC has collaborated with a specially created Federal-State Joint Board to develop
detailed policies regarding subscribership, defining universal service, and funding. Effective partnering with respect to these
and other types of initiatives that address training, technical support, maintenance, and user-friendly applications as well as
connectivity will be crucial to the nation's future prosperity.</FONT><br>

<br>
Good public policy requires a solid factual predicate. As discussed in this chapter, recent research has revealed new insights
about information have nots. For example:</FONT><br>
<br>
1.The overwhelming majority of Americans want (and currently have access to) telephone service. Although some persons do
not desire basic phone service, most who are phoneless are apparently unable to subscribe for one or more socio-economic
reasons.</FONT><br>

2.Those households who do not have phones and/or online access are disproportionately low income, minority, young (also,
old in the case of PCs/modems), less-educated, mobile, and located in central cities or rural areas. Importantly, many of the
disadvantaged are the most enthusiastic users of online services that facilitate economic uplift and personal empowerment.</FONT><br>

3.For many, staying connected to the network may be a bigger problem than achieving an initial hookup, either for POTS or
the Internet.</FONT><br>

<br>
However, more work needs to be done regarding the have nots. For example, are the same low-income, disadvantaged
individuals also those who are minorities, less-educated, young, or mobile? What is the relationship, if any, between low
income and high-cost areas for schools and libraries vis-&agrave;-vis households? Is flat-rate long-distance connectivity to the Internet
good policy in rural areas? Will Internet telephony--with lower user prices at least partly attributable to an exemption from
payment of subsidy-based access charges--help or harm overall subscribership? As a complement to the new universal service
policy, can improved access to training and technical support reduce the incidence of Internet dropouts?</FONT><br>

<br>
Invoking the eternal lament of those who do research, this chapter must conclude by exhorting analysts to bring into sharper
focus the true profile of the information disadvantaged. Only when this is achieved can policymakers put all Americans on the
road to the 21st century.</FONT><br>
