          <b><u>COMPETITIVE IMPACT STATEMENT</u></b> 
        </center>
        <p> The United States, pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures 
          and Penalties Act, ("APPA") 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 16(b)-(h), files 
          this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the Proposed Final Judgment 
          submitted for entry in this civil antitrust proceeding.

        <ol type="I">
          <li> NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THE PROCEEDING
        </ol>
        </b> 
        <p> On July 31, 2000, the United States filed a Complaint alleging that 
          the acquisition of Carson, Inc. ("Carson") by L'Oreal USA, Inc. ("L'Oreal") 
          would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of 
          the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 18. The Complaint alleges 
          that Carson and L'Oreal are, respectively, the nation's largest and 
          third largest suppliers of adult women's hair relaxer kits sold in the 
          United States. The proposed acquisition of Carson by L'Oreal will result 
          in L'Oreal's controlling three of the top five selling brands and approximately 
          50 percent of adult women's hair relaxer kits sold through retail channels 
          in the United States. As alleged in the Complaint, the elimination of 
          Carson as a significant competitor substantially increases the likelihood 
          that L'Oreal will raise prices of adult women's hair relaxer kits post-acquisition, 
          thereby harming consumers. Accordingly, the prayer for relief in the 
          Complaint seeks among other things: (1) a judgment that the proposed 
          acquisition would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act; and (2) permanent 
          injunctive relief that would prevent Defendants from carrying out the 
          acquisition or otherwise combining their businesses or assets. 
        <p> At the same time the Complaint was filed, the United States also filed 
          a proposed settlement that would permit L'Oreal and L'Oreal S.A. to 
          complete their acquisition of Carson provided that certain assets are 
          divested to preserve competition. The settlement consists of a Proposed 
          Final Judgment and a Hold Separate Stipulation and Order. 
        <p> The Proposed Final Judgment orders Defendants to divest the <i>Gentle 
          Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup> and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          brands and associated assets to an acquirer approved by the United States. 
          Defendants must complete these divestitures within ninety (90) calendar 
          days after the filing of the Complaint, or five days after notice of 
          the entry of the Final Judgment, whichever is later. If Defendants do 
          not complete the divestitures within the prescribed time, then, under 
          the terms of the proposed Final Judgment, this Court will appoint a 
          trustee to sell the brands and associated assets. In the event a trustee 
          is appointed, the Proposed Final Judgment provides that the trustee 
          shall have the right, upon approval by the United States, to divest 
          Carson's manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois. 
        <p> The Hold Separate Stipulation and Order, which this Court entered 
          on July 31, 2000, and the Proposed Final Judgment require Defendants 
          to maintain the products sold under the<i> Gentle Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> brands as an economically viable 
          part of an ongoing competitive business, with competitively sensitive 
          business information and decision-making relating to the products sold 
          under the two brands kept separate from L'Oreal's other businesses. 
          Defendants have designated two Carson employees to monitor and ensure 
          their compliance with these requirements. 
        <p> The United States and Defendants have stipulated that the Proposed 
          Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry 
          of the Proposed Final Judgment would terminate this action, except that 
          this Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify or enforce 
          the provisions of the Proposed Final Judgment and to punish violations 
          thereof.

        <p> L'Oreal S.A., a French corporation based in Paris, France, is the 
          world's largest hair care and cosmetics company, with operations in 
          over 150 countries and over 42,000 employees. Last year, L'Oreal S.A. 
          reported over $10 billion in worldwide annual sales and $11 billion

          USA, Inc. ("L'Oreal"), a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, 
          New York. Both L'Oreal S.A. and L'Oreal manufacture and market such 
          well known brands as <i>L'Oreal</i><sup>&#174;</sup><i>, Lancome</i><sup>&#174;</sup><i>,

          Giorgio Armani Parfums</i><sup>&#174;</sup><i>, Biotherm</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          and <i>Helena Rubinstein</i><sup>&#174;</sup>. Soft Sheen Products, 
          Inc. ("Soft Sheen"), based in Chicago, Illinois, is a wholly owned subsidiary 
          of L'Oreal. L'Oreal acquired Soft Sheen in 1998. Soft Sheen makes and 
          sells ethnic hair care products, which are products primarily formulated 
          for, and marketed to, African-American consumers. These products include 
          hair relaxer kits, hair color kits, hair dressings, shampoos and conditioners. 
          Soft Sheen's brands include <i>Optimum Care</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, the 
          top-selling retail brand of adult women's hair relaxer kits in the United 
          States. It also sells retail adult women's hair relaxer kits under the 
          <i>Alternatives</i><sup>&#174;</sup> and <i>Frizz Free</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          brands.

        <p> Carson is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Savannah, Georgia. 
          Founded in 1901, Carson is a global leader in products specifically 
          formulated to address the physiological characteristics of hair of consumers 
          of African descent. Carson makes and sells a complete line of ethnic 
          hair care products, including hair relaxers, shampoos, conditioners, 
          hair oils, hair colors, and shaving cremes. It is the nation's leading

        </b> 
        <p> On or about February 25, 2000, L'Oreal entered into an agreement with 
          Carson to purchase for $5.20 per share the common stock of Carson. The 
          value of the cash tender offer is approximately $79 million. This proposed 
          combination, which would substantially lessen competition in the sale 
          of adult women's hair relaxer kits in the United States, precipitated 
          the United States's antitrust suit.

            </ol>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p> The Complaint alleges that the development, production and sale of 
          adult women's hair relaxer kits through retail outlets is a relevant 
          product market under Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Hair relaxers are 
          chemicals used primarily by African-American women to straighten their 
          naturally curly hair prior to styling. Unless an African-American woman 
          with naturally curly hair relaxes her hair, any hair style she adopts, 
          aside from a totally natural look, will be short-lived. By relaxing 
          her hair, an African-American woman has more styling options. Between 
          65 and 80 percent of adult African-American women routinely relax their 
          hair, spending in excess of $200 million annually on hair relaxers and 
          associated products. 
        <p> Adult women's hair relaxer kits are marketed specifically to African-American 
          women for home use. Each relaxer kit typically contains everything needed 
          to relax hair, including: (i) a complete set of instructions; (ii) gloves; 
          (iii) two bottles of chemicals (the activator and relaxer base) that, 
          when mixed, form the chemical that relaxes the hair (invariably the 
          active chemical in relaxer kits is "no-lye" calcium hydroxide); (iv) 
          a bottle of a neutralizing shampoo to deactivate the relaxer; (v) conditioners 
          to repair split ends and make the hair appear thicker or fuller; and 
          in some kits, (vi) a gel to protect against scalp injury. 
        <p> There are no good substitutes for adult women's hair relaxer kits. 
          The unique qualities and characteristics of these hair relaxer kits 
          distinguish them from products such as hot combs and professional hair 
          relaxers sold in bulk to beauticians. Because of the unique qualities 
          and characteristics of adult women's hair relaxer kits, a small but 
          significant increase in the price of women's hair relaxer kits would 
          not cause a sufficient number of purchasers to switch to other products 
          so as to make such a price increase unprofitable. Thus, the Complaint 
          alleges that a relevant product market in which to assess the competitive 
          effects of this acquisition is the development, production and sale 
          of adult women's hair relaxer kits through retail outlets. 
        <p> The Complaint further alleges that the United States constitutes a 
          relevant geographic market within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton 
          Act. L'Oreal's and Carson's adult women's hair relaxer kits are manufactured 
          in, and sold and compete throughout, the United States. Virtually no 
          adult women's hair relaxer kits are imported into the United States. 
          A small but significant increase in the price of adult women's hair 
          relaxer kits would not cause a sufficient number of purchasers to switch 
          to hair relaxer kits manufactured outside the United States to make 
          the price increase unprofitable.

              <li> <i> Anticompetitive Consequences of the Acquisition</i>
            </ol>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p> The Complaint alleges that L'Oreal's acquisition of Carson will likely 
          have the following anticompetitive effects: (i) competition generally 
          in the development, production and sale of adult women's hair relaxer 
          kits would be substantially lessened; (ii) the actual and potential 
          competition between L'Oreal and Carson would be eliminated; and (iii) 
          prices for adult women's hair relaxer kits would likely increase. Specifically, 
          the Complaint alleges that Carson and L'Oreal are respectively the nation's 
          largest and third largest suppliers of adult women's hair relaxer kits, 
          and together own three of the top five selling brands. L'Oreal's <i>Optimum 
          Care</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, <i>Alternatives</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, and 
          <i>Frizz Free</i><sup>&#174;</sup> brands and Carson's <i>Dark &amp; 
          Lovely</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, <i>Gentle Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, 
          and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> brands of adult women's hair 
          relaxer kits operate as significant competitive constraints on each 
          firm's prices for its brands. If L'Oreal is permitted to acquire Carson, 
          the substantial competition between the two companies would be eliminated, 
          and L'Oreal would have the power to profitably increase prices unilaterally 
          for one or more of its brands of retail adult women's hair relaxer kits, 
          to the detriment of consumers. 
        <p> This acquisition would increase concentration significantly. The market 
          for adult women's hair relaxer kits is highly concentrated under a standard 
          measure of market concentration employed by economists, called the Herfindahl-Hirschman 
          Index ("HHI"). In this highly concentrated market, with a HHI of approximately 
          2,100, L'Oreal has a share of about 17 percent and Carson has a share 
          of about 33.5 percent of total dollar sales of adult women's hair relaxer 
          kits through retail channels. After acquiring Carson, L'Oreal would 
          dominate the market with approximately a 50.5 percent share, making 
          it nearly twice the size of its next largest competitor. Following the 
          acquisition, the HHI would increase by over 1100 points from approximately 
          2100 to over 3200, well in excess of levels that raise significant antitrust 
          concerns. 
        <p> The Complaint alleges that entry is unlikely to be timely, likely 
          or sufficient to restore the competition lost through this transaction. 
          Barriers to entering this market include: (i) the substantial time and 
          expense required to build a brand reputation to overcome existing consumer 
          preferences; (ii) the substantial sunk costs for promotional and advertising 
          activity to secure the distribution and placement of a new entrant's 
          kit in retail outlets; (iii) the inability of a new entrant to recoup 
          quickly its substantial and largely sunk costs<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
          in promoting its brand; and (iv) the difficulty of securing shelf-space 
          in retail outlets. Most hair relaxer kits introduced in recent years 
          have been unable to gain significant sales within several years after 
          entering. This is due in part to the degree of consumer loyalty and 
          brand recognition for long-established, well-regarded brands such as 
          Carson's <i>Dark &amp; Lovely</i><sup>&#174;</sup><i>, Gentle Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> and L'Oreal's <i>Optimum Care</i><sup>&#174;</sup>. 
          To succeed, an entrant must gain consumer confidence and trust, as hair 
          relaxers contain powerful chemicals that may pose significant health 
          risks, such as burning one's scalp and hair. Developing a reputation 
          for quality, reliability, and performance of one's hair relaxer kit 
          generally takes many years of effort. In short, new entry into the development, 
          production and sale of adult women's hair relaxer kits through retail 
          channels in the United States is time-consuming, expensive and difficult, 
          and thus is unlikely to deter Defendants from exercising market power 
          in the reasonably foreseeable future. <b></b>

          <li> EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
        </ol>
        </b> 
        <p> The Proposed Final Judgment requires significant divestitures that 
          will preserve competition in the sale of adult women's hair relaxer 
          kits through retail channels in the United States. Within ninety (90) 
          calendar days after July 31, 2000, the date the Complaint was filed, 
          or five days after notice of entry of the Final Judgment, whichever 
          is later, Defendants must divest the <i>Gentle Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup>, 
          and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> brands and associated assets 
          (including the "Johnson Products Co., Inc." and "JP" names) to an acquirer 
          that, in the United States's sole judgment, has the intent and capability 
          (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial 
          capability) of competing effectively in the business of adult women's 
          hair relaxer kits.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> This relief has 
          been tailored to ensure that the ordered divestitures restore competition 
          that would have been eliminated as a result of the acquisition, and 
          prevent L'Oreal from exercising market power in the adult women's hair 
          relaxer kit market after the acquisition. 
        <p> Defendants must use their best efforts to divest these assets as expeditiously 
          as possible. The Proposed Final Judgment provides that the assets must 
          be divested in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole 
          discretion, that the acquirer can and will use the assets as part of 
          a viable, ongoing business engaged in the sale of adult women's hair 
          relaxer kits through retail channels in the United States. Until the 
          ordered divestitures take place, Defendants must cooperate with any 
          prospective purchasers. 
        <p> If Defendants do not accomplish the ordered divestitures within the 
          prescribed time period, then Section V of the Proposed Final Judgment 
          provides that this Court will appoint a trustee, selected by the United 
          States, to complete the divestitures. Section V of the Proposed Final 
          Judgment also empowers the trustee to sell, if necessary, certain additional 
          production assets to effect the divestitures. These additional assets 
          entail all the assets at Carson's Chicago, Illinois facility that the 
          United States determines are reasonably necessary for an acquirer to 
          compete effectively and viably in the ethnic hair care industry. 
        <p> If a trustee is appointed, the Proposed Final Judgment provides that 
          Defendants must cooperate fully with the trustee and pay all of the 
          trustee's costs and expenses. The trustee's compensation will be structured 
          to provide an incentive for the trustee based on the price and terms 
          of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished. After 
          the trustee's appointment becomes effective, the trustee will file monthly 
          reports with the United States and this Court setting forth the trustee's 
          efforts to accomplish the required divestiture. If at the end of six 
          months after that appointment, the divestiture has not been accomplished, 
          then the trustee, the United States, and Defendants will make recommendations 
          to this Court, which shall enter such orders as appropriate to carry 
          out the purpose of the Final Judgment.

          <li> ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
        </ol>
        </b> 
        <p> The United States considered, as an alternative to the proposed Final 
          Judgment, a full trial on the merits against Defendants. The United 
          States is satisfied, however, that the divestiture of the <i>Gentle 
          Treatment</i><sup>&#174;</sup> and <i>Ultra Sheen</i><sup>&#174;</sup> 
          brands, associated assets, and other relief contained in the Proposed 
          Final Judgment will establish, preserve and ensure a viable competitor 
          in the relevant market identified by the United States. Thus, the United 
          States is convinced that the Proposed Final Judgment, once implemented 
          by the Court, will prevent L'Oreal's acquisition of Carson from having 
          adverse competitive effects.

        <b> 
        <ol type="I" start="7">
          <li> STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER THE APPA FOR PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
        </ol>
        </b> 
        <p> The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases 
          brought by the United States be subject to a sixty (60) day comment 
          period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the Proposed 
          Final Judgment is "in the public interest." In making that determination, 
          the court <i>may </i>consider-- 
        <ol type=1>
          <p>
          <li>the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of 
            alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration 
            or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually 
            considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy 
            of such judgment; 
            <p>
          <li>the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and 
            individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth 
            in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if 
            any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial. 
        </ol>
        <p>15 U.S.C. &#167; 16(e) (emphasis added). As the Court of Appeals for 
          the District of Columbia has held, the APPA permits a court to consider, 
          among other things, the relationship between the remedy secured and 
          the specific allegations set forth in the government's complaint, whether 
          the decree is sufficiently clear, whether enforcement mechanisms are 
          sufficient, and whether the decree may positively harm third parties. 
          <i>See United States v. Microsoft Corp.</i>, 56 F.3d 1448, 1458-62 (D.C. 
          Cir. 1995). 
        <p> In conducting this inquiry, "the Court is nowhere compelled to go 
          to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect 
          of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through 
          the consent decree process."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Rather, 
        <blockquote> 
          <p> absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge 
            its duty, the Court, in making its public interest finding, should 
            .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carefully consider the explanations of the government 
            in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments 
            in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under 
            the circumstances.<a
href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
        </blockquote>
        <p> Accordingly, with respect to the adequacy of the relief secured by 
          the decree, a court may not "engage in an unrestricted evaluation of 
          what relief would best serve the public." <i>United States v. BNS, Inc.,</i> 
          858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988), <i>quoting</i> <i>United States v. 
          Bechtel Corp.,</i> 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 
          454 U.S. 1083 (1981); <i>see also Microsoft,</i> 56 F.3d at 1458. Precedent 
          requires that 
        <blockquote> 
          <p> the balancing of competing social and political interests affected 
            by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first 
            instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role 
            in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government 
            has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. 
            The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree 
            is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement 
            is "<i>within the reaches of the public interest.</i>" More elaborate 
            requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement 
            by consent decree.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
        </blockquote>
        <p> The proposed Final Judgment, therefore, should not be reviewed under 
          a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate every anticompetitive 
          effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of 
          free competition in the future. Court approval of a final judgment requires 
          a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required 
          for a finding of liability. A "proposed decree must be approved even 
          if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own, as 
          long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is 'within the 
          reaches of public interest.'"<a
href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
        <p> Moreover, the court's role under the APPA is limited to reviewing 
          the remedy in relationship to the violations that the United States 
          has alleged in its complaint, and does not authorize the court to "construct 
          [its] own hypothetical case and then evaluate the decree against that 
          case." <i>Microsoft</i>, 56 F.3d at 1459. Since the "court's authority 
          to review the decree depends entirely on the government's exercising 
          its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first place," 
          it follows that the court "is only authorized to review the decree itself," 
          and not to "effectively redraft the complaint" to inquire into other 
          matters that the United States might have but did not pursue. <i>Id.</i>
