<p>INTERVIEWER: OK. This is October 8, 1997. We are talking to Frankie Ola Mae Nolan, whose maiden name was Jenkins. This is her daughter-in-law, Karen Nolan, who is the interviewer.  We were going to backtrack just a little bit. Let me pause for a second, though.... I want to add that this is Tape 3, Side 1, and we don't expect a side two today, but maybe we can finish a side one. I'd like to back up a little bit to when you went overseas the first time. We had talked just a minute ago about how you had actually read an account of the fall of Bataan in the Philippines before you even went overseas. I was asking you if you were ever worried about being captured.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: I guess I didn't tell you about ... When Corregidor fell, [cough] ... There was a unit from Camp Bowie, Texas&#151;I think it was the 131st Field Artillery&#151;were sent over. I was dating a guy in that outfit and he came to tell me they were going, that they'd gotten orders and would be leaving the next day or so. Anyway, they were supposedly going to the Philippines as replacement troops. They got on a ship that was captured before they got to the Philippines. They were taken to Fiji, I think, was where they were captured. They moved them on to Corregidor. They were on the death march from Corregidor. I never heard any more about the guy. I don't know what happened to him. I think, I can't remember what his name was at the time, but I remember when he said goodbye, I said, "We'll probably be joining you pretty soon." And he said, "Well, when you get word that you're coming, let me know and I'll get in a rowboat and come out to meet you." [Chuckles] I always thought about that, how ridiculous that statement was when you got over there and saw the country and everything. But it didn't turn out. He didn't get a rowboat. But that stayed in my mind for a long time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Were you worried about ever being captured? Did you ever have any horror stories told to you?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: No. We thought about it a little bit, but we were never in any area&#151;the closest we ever came to any combat was when we landed in Manila and took us the wrong direction and got us almost to the front lines. We could hear the gunfire. And then, of course, there were a few times when we had air raids over&#151;just reconnaissance, more or less; they weren't really air raids. But we'd hear Japanese planes coming and they'd send an alarm out to us and they'd have us get out. They had big holes&#151;sort of trenches&#151;built out in sort of a smooth area near the hospital compound. We could run and get in those areas. A couple of times&#151;I'd always remember the one time: We'd always walk over to the mess hall at night and get a cup of coffee. They'd usually have some homemade bread and jam or something that we could make a sandwich with. This Agnes Ramden was one of the girls from Louisiana who was one of the nurses with us. She was a funny girl anyway. She looked like Olive Oyl. [Ed. Note: Olive Oyl is the name of a character in the comic strip Popeye, which first appeared in 1937.] She had real skinny legs and real skinny arms. She really was a typical Olive Oyl. We called her Olive Oyl, in fact. Anyway, she was coming back with a cup of hot coffee, a canteen cup of hot coffee, and they sounded an air raid warning and she didn't fasten her holder on the canteen cup enough and the coffee spilled. She came screaming through the area because she had that hot coffee all over her, down her clothes and everything. She didn't get any serious bums from it or anything, but she really had quite an episode with that.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: This sort of leads into the other question I was going to ask you. I noticed when I went back and did a little research on what you were telling me, as far as the islands you went to, that you were following the troops.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Oh definitely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: How close were you following them? Were there nurses and hospitals closer to the front lines?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Oh, I imagine. The field hospitals were the ones&#151;that's the 2"d Field&#151;that was the most advanced hospital we were in. Most of the time, they had medics with the troops, you know.  They would call for medics. If a guy got shopshot would call a medic and he would come over and render whatever aid he could. Then they'd evacuate them back to our hospital. We were never that close to the combat. Maybe it was a matter of a few miles...</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: So the medics would take them to a field hospital and then the field hospital would send them on back?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Except that later they didn't have that many field hospitals. The field hospitals were more like the ones you saw in that, what was that one that made such a big hit here?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: M&lowast;A&lowast;S&lowast;H&lowast;?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: "M&lowast;A&lowast;S&lowast;H&lowast;, yea.  More like the MASH [Mobile Army Surgical Hospital] units. They were real able to pack up and take off real easily and move along. They didn't have a lot of equipment and they didn't have a big component of troops or nurses or anything. They had a few nurses and a few doctors and that was it. A few medics. But they didn't really try to do anything very extensive because they tried to keep moving the patients backward down to the safer areas. That's what we did when we were on Biak. That was where they brought the people in and then they'd come in and evacuate them by planes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: So after they took Biak they moved on to the next island. So when they moved on, they brought you guys into Biak so they could fall back to your position?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: After the fighting ... You know, Biak had been quite a battlefield. They had a lot of caves there and they were fighting with flame throwers and all that stuff into these caves, and the Japs were running out of the caves and attacking and everything. It had been quite a battlefield. Then they moved our hospital in there. Because they had a big, level&#151;it was up on a big cliff. It was sort of like a big cliff out of the ocean. It was pretty level on top. So they had air strips there where the planes could come in and pick the patients up and bring them back. It was a big evacuation center for the troops.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Tell me a little about moving from place to place on the islands. How long would it take you to get there? How would you get there?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Well, we traveled different ways. I think I told you about riding on the Dutch hospital&#151;or whatever that hospital ship was.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Right. That was from Australia to New Guinea.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Australia up to Oro Bay.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: And for the record, Oro Bay is just up a little from Milne Bay?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Yes.  And when we left 0ro Bay, they got us up at four o'clock in the morning and told us to get out to the airstrip. All we could carry&#151;well, we had our clothes and we had a muzette bag with our underpants and whatever we needed in that line. And our shoes. We had a bedroll. And that was all. So we'd just put all that stuff together and go out to the airstrip. I remember sitting out there on a bedroll in the rain waiting for the plane to come in to get us to take us up to&#151;where did we go from there? Biak I guess.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: From where? Where were you when this happened? This was in Oro...</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Oh, Finschhafen. That's where we went to.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: So when you went from Finschhafen to Biak Island, how did you get there?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: We must have gone by plane. I can't quite remember that. It was such a short... Well, I guess we were on a hospital ship. I think there was a ship that took us across to Biak. I can't remember how we got over there or what happened when we got there. Most of the places I can remember landing and the ordeal of trying to get your stuff together. But I didn't have a footlocker. My footlocker was lost somewhere down in the New Guinea area. Someplace. They found it anyway, and they brought it to me in Japan, the day that I got orders to come back to the States, they called me and told me my footlocker had caught up with me. They brought this footlocker up just covered with old green moss, and everything in it was covered with mold, so I didn't have anything I could save out of it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Well, let's not jump too far ahead. From Biak you went into the Philippines.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Yes. We went on a ship on that one. On a hospital ship, but I can't remember the name of it. But they took us up. We landed just opposite&#151;we didn't land, we anchored out and they took us off in landing craft to go in. I know we went in just at the bottom of the Manila Hotel. I remember the Manila Hotel so well because, you know my brother Speck was in the 7th Cavalry &#151; that's the one we followed them all the way. Every time he'd hear about MacArthur moving, he'd say, "I guess I'll be seeing you again soon because you know who arrived today." OF course, you couldn't call any names or anything, but I knew he was talking about MacArthur. He had said, "You follow MacArthur pretty close, don't you?" He always said, "I guess I'll be seeing you soon because so-and-so arrived today."</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: So your hospital then was kind of following MacArthur people?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: We were following wherever there was action.  We were there to take care of any... that's how we came to be. In Finschhafen, we went up there and set up the hospital for the invasion of Hollandia. MacArthur was already at Hollandia at that time and had his headquarters there. But then it never came about. They didn't have any casualties at all. That was where we worked so hard. We were working, ten &#151; 18 and 20 hours a day.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Right. You were telling me about that and I was reading. They said that the Japanese had apparently expected them someplace else and so Hollandia fell real easily.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANXIE: Yes.  They didn't even come to Hollandia at all.  Well, they had been bombing Rabaul so Iong that I think they expected them to make an invasion out there. I don't think we ever invaded out there. I think they just inflicted it all by Air Force, by air. I think they won Rabaul by&#151;I think that's on New Britain island.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Right. Yes, there's a whole section in the history here about Rabaul. And I think you're right.  I think what they decided to do was just skip it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Right, and not even go to Hollandia.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: No, Rabaul. Hollandia they did.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: They must have known that MacArthur was up there because. It was surprising because they really had us working so hard trying to get us ready to receive casualties. We got ready and the day the invasion was supposed to happen, nothing. We didn't see anybody. I think there was a truck carrying some troops that overturned on a stick highway coming down the coast. Some of the troops were killed and some were pretty badly injured. But that's the only casualties we saw after setting up that surgery.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Let me back up one more place? You said you'd tell about the time you were in Buna, about the rat. You wanted to talk about the rat. Was that in Buna?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Yes. Well, that was in Oro Bay. That's where we&#151;we slept in these tents and we had the mosquito nets. We had to sleep under mosquito nets, otherwise the mosquitoes would have carried us off. At nighttime, the rats would come out and forage, try to find some food or whatever they could. Of course, they say they'd been eating on the carcasses of the dead bodies over in the jungle over there. But they were huge. I never saw such rats. They were as big as cats. These two got up on top of my mosquito netting. You know how those things work. I don't know if you ever saw a picture of one.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: You described it to me.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: They had big poles at the end of the bed and you hooked the mosquito net on four corners so that it made kind of a little box shape and you got under that and tucked it in under your mattress and you were protected from the mosquitoes. These two, I don't know if they were fighting over a bit of food that I'd left laying around or something, I don't know. But they were fighting up on my bunk and woke me up. You could hear them growling at each other, making some kind of a noise. I realized what was going on and I started yelling for somebody to come to rescue. Of course, the activity and hearing somebody below them, they started scampering away. They came down the side of the bed and one of the rat's claws got caught in the netting and scraped my leg. It didn't cause any bleeding or anything, so I never had it examined or anything. lt just gave me a scrape.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: And a scare, I imagine.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: [Chuckles.] Well, it sure did. Believe me, I didn't take a chance on getting near any of those things again.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Can you describe a little better some of the hospitals? I got the impression that the one in Finschhafen&#151;not the field hospital but the big one, the general hospital&#151;was that in a brick building?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANIKIE: Oh no. There were no buildings.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: OK, I got confused somewhere along the line. Describe them for me.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Actually, what they did. It was all tents. They'd have one section set up for headquarters. They had mess halls that were set up in tents. And then they had the hospital laying out and around. It depended on how many bed capacity they had, how many hospital tents they put up. The had&#151;I can't remember if they all had floors in them or not. It seems like they did, but I'm not sure. In Finschhafen I know we had floors in our wards. Just boards. And then the tents. I guess they had flaps they'd let down. I can't remember that part of it too much. They were just big  tents. They'd put just cots in there. Twenty or thirty or how many they thought you needed in that particular section. That was a hospital. They'd have different ones for different purposes. They had the surgery and a surgery tent. And they had&#151;thank goodness they didn't have any OB tents. But they had a chapel.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Did they have a general medical tent?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: They had general medical, yes. They had an "acutely ill." That's where I spent a great deal of time, where we had patients who were more acute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Those were the ones that had the fevers and that sort of thing?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: And what?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Fevers?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Different diseases, like ulcers. A lot of them got stomach ulcers from all the upset.  Rather than go crazy from all the stress and tension, they developed ulcers. So we had a lot of stomach patients and a lot of people with terrible skin rashes. Awful skin rashes because of the dampness; so much wet clothing all the time. And fungal infections.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Now that we're talking a little bit about&#151;the fact that your one hospital was turned into a mental hospital. You said you had been dealing, from time to time, [you] had mental patients.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Oh yes. They'd come in anyplace. They'd get nutty and do nutty things. They couldn't handle them in combat so they'd send them back to the hospital and then you'd send them further, wherever. But this particular hospital turned into completely&#151;that's all they wanted was staff people for taking care of mental patients.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Could you describe some of the symptoms&#151;what "getting nutty" meant, or what they would do?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: In the first place, they would talk incoherently. You couldn't understand what they were saying. And they'd talk about things that had no connection with any happenings around them. They'd talk about &#151; most of it was fearful things. Terrible fear. "They're coming to get me," and 0 that kind of stuff. But they never really related it to combat. They related it to other situations, where dreadful things were going to happen to them but they didn't know what. They'd talk all these &#151; they'd tell all these tales, but they had no reality to them at all. Some of them would fight everything you tried to do for them. What we did, we gave a lot of chloral m g hydrate,which was a liquid sedative that we gave.  We used to give it to them when they'd come down. That would settle them down pretty good. We'd give it to them by mouth. If we could get them to take it. Sometimes they'd fight the medicine and they'd fight the restraints if we put restraints on them and they'd tear up things. They'd tear up their beds and they'd tear up their tents. Anything,. One place I told you, they had a sheet metal cover on this one ward and one night this guy just went right through that sheet metal. Took the whole thing off. The whole section &#151; it came in big strips - took the whole section off and cot out and was running loose. They had to chase him down. You'd see them chasing patients around all over the place sometimes. That wasn't anything,. They'd try to get away, and they didn't know where they were going,. They'd ran toward the jungle, trying to get away, which was a dumb thing. If they'd had any reason they wouldn't have thought of doing ., that. But they weren't in a real world at all.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: Were you surprised to find mental patients? Had you been warned about it?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Even when we were back in the States, when I was stationed down at the Point of Embarkation down in New Orleans, one night I had just gone off duty and the chief nurse called over and said, "Go back to your ward, we're getting a shipload of people from Guadeloupe Island. They're mental patients." I think they said there were 40 of them coming in. I can't remember the exact number. Anyway, there was a bunch coming in on a ship. So we had to go back to the ward and get set up. I remember I spent the night going through barracks' bags, writing down all the stuff that they'd brought back with them.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Karen Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>INTERVIEWER: These were soldiers? I got the impression these were civilians for some reason.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Well, we had a bunch of civilians come in too. They were ... but these were soldiers. We had to account for everything they had. Even every match that was in their barracks' bag. We had to write it down on the list. I don't know whatever happened to those lists. I don't think anybody ever bothered to claim any of their stuff after it was all over. But that was just the practice that we had. But those guys who came up, they were French. They spoke French. What is the French province down off South America?</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: French New Guinea'.)</p>

But then they got such a need for mental care that they decided to make that &#151; because it was a small unit and they'd be able to convert it easily. So they made it into a mental hospital.

And of course the Filipino women had these little tents that they'd set up and they had a little red lantern that they'd put outside of the door. They just had a cot in there. The guys would come in and leave their money on the table or someplace nearby and hop in bed with them and do their thing and get up and leave. They had these prophylactic stations where they went out and took some kind of treatment. I don't know what all they did. I never saw any procedure for doing, prophylactics. But they had those stations where they would go and use some kind of treatment after having sex with these gals. But it didn't always work and a lot of times the guys didn't bother to go to prophylactic. Apparently it wasn't a very pleasant procedure, whatever it was.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: It seems like lt was about two or three days.  I just don't remember the exact duration of it.

I didn't have decent underwear or anything because all that stuff had been in my footlocker. She was up in St. Albens, New York, so she got all her Navy nurses together and they went down into New York shopping. Everybody bought something to put in the package to send back to me. She wrote me a letter saying they had mailed the package and it would he coming up soon. When we got to Okinawa, the military post office there had radioed the ship that they had a lot of mail for our unit that was traveling on our ship. The first typhoon came in about that time and they said, "We can't send our little boats ashore to pick up the mail until this typhoon passes." Then the next one came right in on the heels of it and it was so severe that it washed big old transport ships up on the beach. We got up in the morning after it had all settled down and got clear so we could see, you'd see these ships sitting up on that sandy beach. Big old ships. Big old cargo ships sitting up there that had been washed ashore. That was why the captain said we've got to get moving and try to keep this ship off the shore.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: It was three days after MacArthur passed by. He had to be there for three days before they would let us go ashore off of Kobe to be sure there was no uprising or no fighting or anything. They protected us pretty much. They were really very cautious about it. If we got into any strange combat areas or anything like that, it was usually because of accidents, people not understanding where they were taking us. We had to wait until they declared it secure. Then we went in. They took us in big trucks. We went off at Kobe. I think I told you the contrast between going back there 50 years later and seeing what Kobe ... You know, when Andy and I took that freighter, we went to Kobe. We landed there and anchored there for a couple of days. We had a chance to go back into Kyoto. Kyoto was a shrine city. The American troops &#151; the American Air Force &#151; never bombed it or anything. They protected the fact that it was a religious city. It had never been bombed or anything. They had some big Red Cross hospitals there. We took over one of the Red Cross hospitals. It was a big brick building with lots of wards and surgery and the whole thing. I was assistant surgical supervisor at that time. A chief nurse in charge of surgery, or whatever they called it. Anyway, I had charge of the surgical wards.  But we didn't have very much surgery because most of the illnesses were just plain physical illnesses. There was no war going on. No injuries or anything. So one of my other duties was to try to train the Japanese women to be maids up in the nurses quarters. I used to take those gals up there in the nurses quarters and I'd take them into the bathroom and I'd say, "mop" and I'd hold a mop up and have them repeat it several times and then I'd show them what you do with it. Then a broom and all that stuff. But I only did that for a couple of days. That's when I came down with pneumonia, or near pneumonia. I went into the hospital. I didn't have any clothes. The only warm clothes I had &#151;one of the administrative officers had fleece-lined sweatshirt and he grave that to me and I wore it under my khaki shirt. That was the only kind of warmth I had at 0. I didn't have any outer garments to wear at all because all of my stuff had been lost.</p>

So I got &#151; I guess it was pneumonia. I never really saw any diagnosis in anything. Anyway, I went into the hospital. I was in there for several days.

I think I told you about how I went into this big Japanese department store. I was looking for some kind of souvenirs to bring home. They didn't have anything except kimonos and I didn't think anybody that I knew would want a kimono. I did buy a little Japanese doll. Anyway, I was in this women's department looking to see what they had and this guy came up behind me and he said, "Pardon me." I looked around, I thought it was going to be an American guy.  But he was a little Japanese man. He said, "I wanted to ask you about the styles back in the States. What are they wearing back there these days?" I said, "You probably know better than I do because I haven't been there for two years." He said, "I was a buyer for Marshall Field's." I think that was a big department store in Chicago. He said, "I was a buyer for Marshall Field's and I got caught over [here]." I don't know how he got back to Japan. But he must have gotten back. Anyhow, he had lived in Chicago for quite a while. It startled me so to turn around and see that little Japanese man speaking in English. Anyway, I ended up buying a little Japanese doll and I think that was about all. They didn't have anything in the store. There was nothing in there. They had depleted everything they had. Couldn't buy anything at all.</p>

Then there was another one bom&#151;Irene had Maggie Lou. Then the other cousin, one of my mother's brothers, had a daughter who lived there. She had a baby. Her little girl didn't have very much because her dad had ran away or I guess they'd gotten divorced or something. Anyway she didn't have a father. I felt sorry for the little kid, so I gave her the Japanese doll when I got home. I don't know whatever happened to her since. I don't know where she is any more or whether she's still got the Japanese doll.</p>

Anyway, it was a town over across from us. We were going to Manila &#151; I mean to Tokyo. We were going to fly out of Tokyo, but we had to go over to this one station to get the train to go into Tokyo.

<p> FRANKIE: Well, we landed in Tokyo and they took us into the city of Tokyo. They took us to a hotel across from the Japanese palace. They didn't have any place for us to sit down or anything. It was so crowded. Finally, our chief nurse said, "These girls are just so exhausted, we've got to get them someplace where they can rest," because we rode the train all night. It was jam packed. Every time they'd pass a shrine, all the Japanese would bow and hit you in the back and put their butts in your face and everything else.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: To Tokyo. Then when we got to Tokyo they took us to this hotel. We went to the hotel to have our meals, and that was the first time I ever saw a Russian soldier. When we walked into the lobby of the hotel, there were these big old Russian soldiers sitting there in their baggy uniforms in the big easy chairs. None of them ever bothered to get up to let us sit down or anything. We went in to eat and then they took us next door to an empty building and put some cots down. They brought some blankets in so we could lie down and rest until our plane time. Then they took us in a truck out to the airport and put us on our plane to fly home.</p>

<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: Part of them. Some of them had been assigned to us along the way. Some of them were not. A lot of the people we were with at that time were not eligible to come home. They had a point system where you had to have been in service so Iong and so forth. You had to be overseas so long before you ... you got so many points and then you were eligible to come home.</p>
<p>They flew us out. We were flying on a C-54, transport. It had bucket seats. I don't know whether you ever saw one of those planes with bucket seats. They had little seats along the sides that were like &#151;they were like buckets, really. You just sat in them. You've seen those old chairs that have just a sort of a scooped seat. Well, that's what they were. We made a stop &#151;I can't remember what island we stopped on &#151;for refueling. When I got off the plane, the guy says to me, "You look sick. We'd better do something about you." I said, "I just got out of the hospital." So he said, "I'm going to take care of you." He brought some stretchers on and hung them up in the plane above the seats. They put me in one of those. Then our chief nurse said, "We're just going to be flying across the ocean all night. We might as well get some sleep." So she came around with the sleeping pills. The next morning, the co-pilot came back to see how we were doing. He came back to see how I was, because they were concerned about my health. I said, "I don't know anything. The chief nurse gave us a sleeping pill and I slept all night." I didn't know anything. He said, "My god, if I'd known that! There was a time that we were in such bad weather that we were thinking we were going to have to ditch the plane. I didn't realize I had a bunch of dead nurses back here to try to get awake." Then we landed the next day in Kwajalein. We were getting bag lunches wherever we went...</p>

<p>FRANKIE: We had a 20-hour flight from Tokyo to San Francisco at that time.  But Kwajalein was one &#151;they had a little base there. As we were going in to land, I looked out the window and I saw this fire and I said, "Hey, there's a big fire down there."  When we landed, the guy &#151; the officer in charge&#151; came out to the plane. He said, "Did you see the fire as you came in?" We said yes. He said, "That was your lunch. Our mess hall burned down." They had to fix us a sandwich and let us go. At that time, they didn't feed on the airplanes at all. They didn't have any facilities for feeding. They had sack lunches they'd usually send with you. Or whatever. It'd usually be a sandwich made with bully beef and homemade bread and maybe a piece of fruit if they had any fruit. So didn't see very much of that. Anyway, we didn't have any lunch that day. We came on in to Hawaii &#151;Honolulu &#151;and landed at Hickham field. They told us when we got there, "Some of you are going to have to stay a few days because we don't know how much transportation we're going to have back to the States. We'll probably send you home alphabetically, but we'll call you if we're going to be sending you home. We may have some go tomorrow. So about 5:30 in the morning, I heard somebody calling "Jenkins." I said to the sergeant in charge, "You can just forget about me when my name comes up. I'd like to stay here a few days and recuperate." She said, "Do you still want to stay here or do you want to go home?" I said, "I want to go home." So she said, "You've got a flight at seven o'clock in the morning then."</p>

<p>FRANKIE: I don't know really of anything spectacular that had happened.  He was just telling us that there had been hardships and people had begun to recover and were able to have a few more things than they'd had before. A few more things were available. How they would handle us when we got to our final destination was what he mainly wanted to talk about, and to try to let us know about any changes. Then they took us to a mess hall. They said, "This mess hall is prepared to serve anything you want. So whatever you've been hungry for, tell them and they'll fix it for you." We all set down and ordered T-bone steaks and big salads and a pitcher of milk and ice cream. They brought out these huge steaks. We hadn't been eating anything for so long our stomachs had shrunk up, so we couldn't begin to eat all the stuff they put on. And the salad &#151;we got into that salad and ate that like it was going out of style. We hadn't had any fresh vegetables at all for years. It was sad when you looked at the plates, because you'd take a couple of bites and you were full. You couldn't begin to eat that steak and the french fries and the salad. Of course, we saved room for the ice cream because none of us had had &#151;we hadn't had any milk products at all for ail those years. In Australia they wouldn't even let us eat the milk products because they said the milk didn't have proper nutrients in it. We used to sneak around the comer&#151;I'll have to tell that it's out of sequence though. When we were in Brisbane, there was a place we went to get ice cream. I can't remember what they called it but they had waffles. They'd put a waffle, then a scoop of ice cream and then another waffle and cover it with butterscotch sauce. It really tasted delicious. We'd sneak around to the tea shop and get that every once in a while when we could. We didn't get into town very often, really. Anyway, when we got out of eating, they told us we could make a phone call. I called my mother to tell her I was home. We'd landed there on her birthday &#151;October the 31st was when we landed in Hamilton. I called her and it was her birthday. She wanted to know where I was going, and what was going to happen to me. I said I'll call you again to let you know but I don't know now. We're going down to Los Angeles in the morning. We'll be dispersed from there, wherever they feel like&#151;closest to our home, probably. We got on that special train that ran down from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We did have a couple of days at Hamilton. I know because I went in there to get a permanent. I went in to that Livingston's, that big department store, to the beauty shop there.</p>

I applied and we had to send in all of our records and everything. I was accepted for the following September to enroll in the University of Texas in their advanced nursing program. In the meantime I was recruited by Uncle Sam. When I told them I had to go to the war but I was supposed to get out in a year, they said, "Well you get in touch with us next year when your time is up and we'll reschedule you for next year's class."

</dd>
<dt class="format">Frankie Nolan:</dt>
<dd class="indent">
<p>FRANKIE: They assigned me to a medical floor. It had a 101 beds in this medical floor. I was supposed to be the charge nurse there. We had some young nurses who had just graduated from my school who were stationed there, from the school I'd trained in Fort Worth. I was amazed at how little training they got&#151;at how little they knew about what was going on. I later had an opportunity to tell our old director of nursing. I said, "What kind of nurses are you turning out these days?" She said, "You know, when you sign up with the government, you can't get rid of these people like we used to do when you were a student. If they weren't satisfactory, we still had to try to bring them through. They're not my best example of nurses, but they're the best we could provide." Anyway, they had some civilians [patients] there, too. We had this any, a Jewish fellow, who had a severe heart attack. His daughter was planning to be married and she was marrying a captain who was being assigned overseas. She wanted to go with him and they were planning to have this wedding, then he had this heart attack. They decided to have it there in the hospital. We had sort of a chapel area, or a&#151;what do you call it&#151;a recreation room at the end of the ward. They decided to set that up and have a wedding ceremony there. None of the nurses or doctors had been to a Jewish wedding before, so we were all invited, of course. I said, "I guess I'll just not go. I'll stay here and cover the ward while the girls go to the wedding.  We had a young doctor there.  He said, "I'll stay here and help you."  When the wedding was over, they came back to get us&#151;the wife of the patient came back to get us. She said, "Come on back anyway and have some cake. We saved a bottle of wine for you. So we went back and he and I sat there and drank that whole bottle of wine. Then we decided we'd make rounds. So we went back in to the ward and we made rounds of the ward.  All the patients were just hysterical. They said, "We wish you'd go to a Jewish wedding every day."  I guess we were a couple of characters. Anyway, we made the rounds.  And we were both polluted to the ears.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: Yes. Anyway, I used to&#151;you know, you have to be so careful whenever you have a patient in oxygen. He was in an oxygen tent. I'd walk in his room and he'd have a cigarette going like crazy. I'd say, "How'd you get that cigarette lit?"  "Well, so-and-so gave me a match."  I'd say, "Put it out immediately. You're going to blow this place up." It didn't seem to bother him, really. I found out later that oxygen isn't as deadly. If you don't have a fire going already, unless you put a fire in the oxygen element, it doesn't explode easily. Anyway, General Eisenhower had decided to come down and make a tour of the hospital. He said he would only be there for a certain length of time and he couldn't make the whole hospital, so he'd just visit one section of the hospital. The chief nurse called me up and said, "The general's coming and he can only visit one section of the hospital, so we've chosen your section for him to visit." When he came to the ward&#151;well, when we got ready to have him, the ward doctor and the other young doctor who was there said, "What are we supposed to do? Are we going to go down and meet him at the entrance to the ward, or what are we going to do?" I said, "I'm going to stand here by my station. If he wants anything from me, he can ask. He's going to have such a mob of people following him around, he won't need me trailing along with him. I'm just going to stay here and take care of the business at the desk." Sure enough, they came up the hall.  He saw me standing there. He just broke out of the line of march and walked over and stuck his hand out and said, "I'm General Eisenhower. I guess you're the nurse in charge." Of course, I gave him a salute. I said, "Yes, I am," and I told him my name. He said, 'I think you're the most qualified around here to tell me about these patients. I want you to make rounds with me." That's the one where we went to this guy and he had his head covered up because he'd been eating grasshoppers.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: That was one of the [mental] patients.  We had come back from the Pacific area.  What did they call that?  Southeast Asia.  Somewhere down in that area, New Guinea or the Philippines or someplace. He'd been a prisoner and he'd eaten grasshoppers. He wouldn't uncover his head to take medicine. He wouldn't uncover his head for anything. He'd just lay there with the covers pulled up over his head. He wouldn't let anybody take the linens off his bed or anything. Finally I got him to talk to me a little bit. I said, "Why do you lie here all day with your head covered up?" He said, "I had to eat grasshoppers and I don't think anybody would want to look at me." That's how badly he felt about it. Anyway, we went around to all the patients and Eisenhower sat on the edge of the bed of every one of them and said, "I'm General Eisenhower and asked them which theater of war they came and talked a little about their experiences. With every patient&#151;101 patients&#151;he talked to every one of them. Then, of course, he left. That's when I thought, that's a very sweet man. I like him. So then when I came to California and he was running for president, I said, "I'm going to become a Republican." So that's when I became a Republican, because I wanted to vote for Eisenhower. When I registered in Southern California, I said, "How do you know which party you want to belong to? I haven't really studied any of the parties that well." I'd just gone with my family, and because they were Democrats, I just signed up as a Democrat when I registered. But I said, "How do you know about the parties?" and they said, "You usually base it on who you want to vote for president, you know, for the offices."  Eisenhower was running for president, so I signed up Republican. I voted for him, and I didn't regret it.  I thought he made a pretty good president.  We at least had peace for a while. He was such a charming man.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: What did you think about your experience in the military?</p>

<p>FRANKIE: Well, at the same time I was there, they were having trouble retaining nurses in the service. They had this colonel come out of Washington, D.C., out of the procurement office. She was visiting the chief nurse on the day my orders came in to be separated. When I went down to clear the chief nurses office, she said, "Come here, we want to talk to you a bit." I went in the office and sat down and she introduced me to this lieutenant colonel or colonel, whatever she was. She said, "We want to know why you're leaving the service." I said, "It's just not what I want or what I think my life should be like." She said, "Is there any way we could entice you to stay in?" I said, "For one thing, I think that for all the years I was over there and all the years I was in service, I've seen an awful lot of people running around with an awfully lot of rank around here and I'm still a first lieutenant and I don't really like that idea. I don't think I want to continue in the military life." So this gal out of Washington said, "if you will sign up to stay, I'll promote you today to a captain and give you six months back pay as a captain &#151; I'll make it retroactive back six months and you'll get paid for that period of time as a captain. And then I'll promote you today to a major." I told them about my episode when the commanding officer wanted me to share his tent with him and I said, "I don't care to be treated like that. I don't think I should ever have to make a decision about whether I want to advance in my position or go to bed with somebody." They were very sorry about that story. Anyway, that's the way it ended up. I said, "No. I think you're offering too little, too late. It would be nice to be a major, but I think there's other fields I can accomplish. So I think I'll just give it a try on the outside." So I went ahead with my clearance and went home. At the same time, when I got back to my room in the dormitory that evening, there was a note under my door. "I'm wondering if you're the same Frankie Jenkins that I knew. If so, I'm staying in such and such a room. Give me a call." And it was signed Inez Hulse. I didn't take the time. I had to pack and leave the next day because I was going on the bus down to Proctor to return to my family. They gave me a month's convalescent leave and they gave me a month of accumulative leave time&#151;I hadn't had a chance to take any vacations overseas, so I had accumulated, accrued a month's leave. I had two months I didn't have anything to do but bum around. I went to southern Texas and visited. I went everywhere I could think of to visit. Then I was scheduled to go into Vanderbilt in September, so I went there.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: You've always been&#151;I've always thought you came across as pretty proud of your service.</p>

<p>FRANKIE: Oh, l was proud of it. I still am. I just wasn't in them mood at that particular time.  When you've been away that long and all of a sudden it's all back there for you, you want to grab the ring and go. So I just couldn't. I'm glad I didn't stay in because when I see the nurses today who came through, and so many of them are so battle worn. They don't have any compassion about anything much. They're kind of dead. The characters I've known who stayed in to retire really are so superficial that they don't have any of the stuff I like to see in a nurse.</p>
