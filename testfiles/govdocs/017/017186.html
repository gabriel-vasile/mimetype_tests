	 <P>I. <U>Statement of the Case</U></P> 
	 <P> This matter is before the Authority on an exception to an award of
		Arbitrator Robert D. Steinberg filed by the Union under section 7122(a) of the
		Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) and part 2425
		of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. The Agency did not file an opposition
		to the Union's exception.</P> 
	 <P> The Arbitrator denied the Union's grievance over the Agency's
		contracting out certain service and maintenance work.</P> 
	 <P> We conclude that the Union fails to establish that the award is
		deficient. Accordingly, we will deny the exception.</P> 
	 <P>II. <U>Background and Arbitrator's Award</U></P> 
	 <P> The Agency contracted out certain service and maintenance work of its
		directorate of engineering and housing. The Union filed a grievance over the
		determination to contract out. The Union contended that the Agency violated OMB
		Circular A-76 and Army Regulation (AR) 5-20, which pertain to the contracting
		out of agency work, and the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. §§
		276a-276a-7. The grievance was not resolved and was submitted to
		arbitration.</P> 
	 <P> Preliminarily, the Arbitrator determined that the grievance was not
		time-barred and that it was grievable and arbitrable on the issue of whether
		the Agency violated any material term or condition of the Davis-Bacon Act, OMB
		Circular A-76, or AR 5-20. On the merits, the Arbitrator determined that the
		Agency had not violated the Davis-Bacon Act, Circular A-76, or AR 5-20. In
		particular, the Arbitrator rejected the Union's claim that the Agency had
		improperly used representative in-step rates in calculating the personnel costs
		for the in-house bid, even though he found that this aspect of the calculations
		was "the most costly of the alleged errors of judgment" committed by the
		Agency. Award at 20-21. The Arbitrator found that AR 5-20 required that the
		Agency use this method of calculation. Although the Arbitrator questioned why
		AR 5-20 mandates the use of a representative in-step rate when that rate could
		"be prejudicial" to the in-house bid, he concluded that the Agency had not
		acted irrationally or abused its discretion. <U>Id.</U> at 21. In addition, the
		Arbitrator found that the Agency did not act in violation of Circular A-76
		because Circular A-76 grants an agency an option of using representative
		in-step rates or, "if available and deemed accurate, an organizationally
		determined average step within each grade." <U>Id.</U> (quoting Circular
		A-76).</P> 
	 <P> Accordingly, the Arbitrator denied the grievance.</P> 
	 <P>III. <U>Exception</U></P> 
	 <P> The Union contends that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator's
		"reason" for rejecting its claim that the Agency improperly used representative
		in-step rates is "wrong." Exception at 1. The Union argues that Circular A-76
		does not legally permit AR 5-20 to require the use of the Government-wide,
		representative in-step rate. The Union also argues that because the Arbitrator
		recognized that use of the representative rate could be prejudicial, the
		Arbitrator had the "duty" to rule that the procurement process was "arbitrary."
		<U>Id.</U></P> 
	 <P> IV. <U>Analysis and Conclusions</U></P> 
	 <P> We conclude that the Union fails to establish that the award is
		deficient on any ground set forth in section 7122(a) of the Statute.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A
		HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(*)</SUP></A></B><A HREF="#N_1_"></A></FONT></P> 
	 <P> The Arbitrator noted that under AR 5-20, use of the Government-wide
		representative in-step rate was mandated in calculating the personnel costs for
		the in-house bid. The Arbitrator rejected the Union's argument that use of the
		actual in-house average rate was the preferred course under Circular A-76. The
		Arbitrator determined that, at best, Circular A-76 is neutral in that it grants
		an agency the option of using the representative rate or an organizationally
		determined average step within each grade. Accordingly, the Arbitrator ruled
		that he could not hold that the Agency abused its discretion and acted
		irrationally by mandating the use of the Government-wide representative rate.
		By merely alleging that the mandated use of the representative rate by the
		Agency is arbitrary and illegal, the Union fails to establish otherwise.

		v. FLRA</U>, No. 90-2699 (D.D.C. Apr. 10, 1991) (union provided no basis for
		finding that the arbitrator's interpretation of an agency regulation was
		erroneous).</P> 
	 <P> We find that the exception constitutes mere disagreement with the
		findings and conclusions of the Arbitrator and provides no basis for finding
		the award deficient. <U>See</U> <U>U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air
		Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas and National Federation of Federal
		Employees, Local 977</U>, 40 FLRA 1099 (1991) (exception constituted
		disagreement with the arbitrator's findings and provided no basis for finding
		the award to be contrary to an agency regulation). Accordingly, we will deny
		the exception.</P> 
	 <P>V. <U>Decision</U></P> 
	 <P> The Union's exception is denied.</P>

		determined that OMB Circular A-76 constitutes a regulation having the force and
		effect of law and that, consequently, Circular A-76 constitutes an applicable
		law within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. </P> <HR>
