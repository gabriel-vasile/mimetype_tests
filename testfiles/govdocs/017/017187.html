<p>Surely you can understand the differences between a Fixed Indexed Annuity and traditional securities.  Surely you understand that a Fixed Indexed Annuity holder is protected with guarantees against loss and even guaranteed a minimal gain.  How could you possibly view this fixed insurance product as a risk security?  I diligently request that you proceed by the letter of the law and exercise all intelligent reasoning.  Please do not act irresponsibly and irrationally as a reactionist to a separate issue.  Do not remove a splinter with a back hoe.  I beseech you to represent us intelligently.

<br />Sincerely,

<br />Eugene C. Long, 

<br />Lancaster County PA</p>
