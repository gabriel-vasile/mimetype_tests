<P>On the much-heralded day of January 1, 2000, many of the computers and
chips embedded in the heart of community's infrastructures will be unable
to recognize the actual date. Normal data transmissions, transportation
and public safety operations, and financial transactions may be performed
irrationally, or not at all. This primer describes how state and local
officials use their leadership to avert the negative impact on their communities.

<P>This primer was made possible through the contributions of researchers
and discussion groups participants. Special thanks go to Clint Page, Kathleen
Guzda, and Robert Hicks, who authored different sections of this primer
for the U.S. Department of Transportation; and the Urban Consortium's Transportation
and Telecommunications and Information Task Forces for their vigilance
and work in identifying issues critical to local governments; and to PTI's
internal Year 2000 (Y2K) team.

<P>Public Technology, Inc. (PTI), is the non-profit technology research,
development, and commercialization organization of the National League
of Cities (NLC), the National Association of Counties (NACo), and the International
City/County Management Association (ICMA). PTI's mission is to advance
the development and use of technology in local and state governments.

<P>PTI's Urban Consortium (UC) is a special network of the nation's largest
cities and counties that focuses on new solutions to common concerns. The
UC provides a creative forum for elected and appointed officials to identify
practical ways to improve the provision of public services while generating
new revenue opportunities.

<P>The UC addresses the critical needs of large local governments through
five technology task forces: Energy, Environment, Telecommunications and
Information, Transportation, and Public Safety. The task forces are staffed
by representatives of the UC member cities and counties who are experts
in these areas and have extensive experience managing practical challenges
in their jurisdictions.

<P>UC members act as urban laboratories to develop and test solutions as
well as to share new technologies and management approaches with other
local governments, both large and small, across the United States.

<P>The Year 2000 (Y2K) challenge is real: Unless we take action now, our
communities may be severely weakened on that fateful Saturday morning in
January 2000. Regional economies may falter, public safety and health may
be compromised, and our citizens may become frustrated and begin to look
for places to lay the blame. Even though the issue reflects programming
choices made decades ago by people in both industry and public service,
it will test our state and local government leadership mettle like no other
challenge in recent years.

<P>Yet, the Y2K challenge also presents a golden opportunity to show local
and state agencies and the private sector how truly essential transportation
institutions really are. We hold in our hands a winning strategy to keep
our national economy going through what may be rough times. We can adopt
the following four-part approach:<p>
<UL>
<li> Prepare the community through awareness programs that mobilize multiple
resources;
<BR><li> Establish solution transfer mechanisms through alliances;
<BR><li> Steer all sectors of the state, regional, and local economies toward
true
<BR>collaboration and interface management; and
<BR><li> Develop contingency plans to combat breakdowns if they occur.
</UL>

<P>It will take leadership for government to be ready!

<P>This primer on intelligent transportation systems and Y2K is one element
of a comprehensive campaign launched by Public Technology, Inc., and its
three sponsoring organizations, the National League of Cities, National
Association of Counties, and International City/County Management Association.
It marks the start of our commitment to overcome this challenge, and indeed,
to make it an opportunity for forging stronger public/private alliances
at all levels of government.
<BR>Federal and state government organizations have already announced their
commitment to this national campaign. We intend to include state, regional,
and local government organizations so officials in all communities, no
matter what their size, are aware of the Year 2000 Problem and have the
tools and resources to develop effective solutions.

<P><font face=arial><B>The Year 2000 Problem</font>
<dir><font face=arial size=2>
<P>Call it the Year 2000 Problem or the Y2K Problem, and it sounds like
a technical glitch. Call it the Millennium Bug, and it sounds like an end-of-the-world
science fiction thriller. Whatever we call it, the problem is real.

<P>Nobody is sure what computers--or for that matter, any of the countless
devices and systems controlled by microchips--are going to do at the stroke
of midnight when December 31, 1999, rolls over to January 1, 2000. Some
computers and systems will make the change smoothly. Some will stop working.
Others will behave erratically.

<P>Why? During the early days of computing, when processing power and storage
capacity were puny compared with those of today, programmers and engineers
reduced the space needed to store dates by recording only the last two
digits of the year; Valentine's Day 1980, for example, was stored as 021480.
(They saw no reason to store the slashes between the month, day, and year,
either.) When this century ends and the new one begins, that practice will
present a problem. Computers won't know the difference between Valentine's
Day, 1901, and Valentine's Day, 2001. They will both be stored as 021401
and collide in the confusion.

<P>Traditional mainframe computers, dominated by older programming languages
such as COBOL, FORTRAN, and others, are where the problem has its roots.
But virtually anything, and everything, that relies on embedded process
controllers (microchips) will be affected. The multitude of personal computers
are threatened. Many older IBM-compatible PCs will not be 'Y2K-compliant,'
(see definition, left) but machines sold after 1997 generally will be.

<P>Macintosh computers will not have a Year 2000 problem, because they
store the date as a number based on the number of seconds since January
1, 1904. This system will handle the year 2000 just fine, but apparently
has its own problem: At 6:28:16 a.m. on February 6, 2040, the total number
of seconds since Jan. 1, 1904, will be too long a number for the allotted
storage space to handle.

<P>Microchips also control security elevators and doors, telephone switches,
traffic signal controllers, and electric utility substations, as well as
small household and office appliances. Industry experts predict that of
the 25 billion chips in electronic components, only about 2 percent will
fail, but which 2 percent? In many, perhaps most, cases these devices will
just stop working. Elevators will descend to the basement or go into security
mode; VCRs will work but will not be able to be programmed.

<P>The problem is not just hardware and chips. Any software that stores
and uses dates--spreadsheets, databases, financial management software of
all kinds, human resources software, and a host of other programs--is vulnerable
to the Year 2000 Problem. By extension, all the data files used by those
programs are also vulnerable.

<P>In ways that may not be obvious, transportation systems too are susceptible
to the problem. The complex links between public and private systems that
move people and goods usually involve computers or automated systems somewhere
along the way. With the growth of intelligent transportation systems, the
use of computers has multiplied in transport and emergency management systems.
Many of those systems include dates in their calculations. The consequences
of such systems failing range from annoying inconveniences to life-threatening
disasters.

<P>Although plenty of attention has been focused on the dangers of a confused
air traffic control system on January 1, 2000, other transportation snafus
that may demand a remedy are timed traffic signals that no longer time,
intelligent transportation systems that are suddenly dumb, and electronic
parking or toll passes that do not permit passage. Buses could be thrown
off their timetables, and parking ticket records might no longer be recorded.

<P>Unlike new personal computers, new sophisticated transportation systems
are not safe. The burgeoning number of transportation systems that rely
on satellite global positioning systems will face an additional punch,
a sort of 'mini-Y2K,' on August 2, 1999. Then, the atomic clocks that keep
track of time by counting the sequence of weeks since Jan. 5, 1980, will
run out of bit space and 'roll over' to Week 0, with the possible result
of inaccurate position calculations. In short, anything electronic that
depends on dates or on calculations involving dates is vulnerable.

<P>&nbsp;You're susceptible if:
<ul>
<li> You have any central or mainframe computer that stores data vital
or important to your state and local government transportation systems.
<P><li> You have a local area network (LAN) over which data and files are
shared, thus allowing dates to be entered in a variety of ways.
<P><li> You use personal computers. The device inside the PC that retains
the date and time when the system is turned off often cannot store a four-digit
year. It will give your operating system an invalid date after January
31, 1999 (perhaps something like 1/1/80).
<P><li> You electronically store any data with a two-digit year.
<P><li> Your telephone system has programmable switches. Phone systems are
almost all controlled exclusively by software, and if the date clocks are
not Y2K-compliant, the whole system is not Y2K-compliant.
<P><li> You have automated security systems with computers that automatically
lock and unlock doors and elevators at night, open them in the morning,
and keep them locked on holidays and weekends.
<P><li> You use global positioning systems (GPS) to locate emergency vehicles.
GPS devices determine&nbsp; distance by measuring how long it takes to
get a signal from several satellites in stationary orbit. On August 22,
1999, many will fail to calculate time correctly. The uses of intelligent
transportation system (ITS ) range from tracking emergency vehicles or
buses, to mapping road accidents or potholes.
<P><li> You use automatic data collection systems, for example, on city-owned
parking meters or electronic toll booths.
<P><li> You have computerized traffic signal systems, gates, toll booths,
subway elevators, or other public transport mechanisms that rely on computers
to open or close them, or automated systems that operate them according
to programmed times.

<font face=arial size=2>
<P>By now there have been enough Chicken Little warnings that everyone
should be looking at the sky. The consequences of ignoring the problem
until New Year's Day 2000 could be great: messy complications that won't
be easily sorted out; snarled transportation; angry taxpayers; irate businessmen;
lawyers bearing lawsuits. Elected officials could become 'unelected' over
their failure on this issue; civil servants could find their constituents
most uncivil.

<P>The bad news is, if your state and local governments have not yet begun
to address the Year 2000 Problem, it already is late. The good news is,
most responsible cities, counties, and states have begun to take remedial
steps, typically starting with obvious areas such as public safety systems
or the computers that handle accounting and payroll.
<BR>The purpose of this primer is to encourage administrators and officials
to look at the less-obvious--but potentially troublesome--problems that may
occur in the vital transportation area.</dir>

<a name=risk>
<P><font face=arial><B>Systems at Risk</B></font>
<dir>
<font face=arial size=2>
<P>The challenge of spotting potential Year 2000 problems in intelligent
transportation systems (ITS), and fixing them before they occur, is complicated
by the hybrid nature of the nation's transportation system. Most ITS are
a mix of private and public enterprise. Often, the public portion of the
responsibility is shared among local, regional, and state governments,
transit authorities, and other entities.

<P>This entwined nature of transportation makes it all the more important
for elected officials and administrators to look closely at the computers
behind their roadways, traffic signal systems, trucking regulations, airports,
shipping ports, rail hubs-in short, behind anything that moves. Chances
are, a computer is involved somewhere, and if that computer uses dates,
it could be the weak link that breaks the chain.

<P>The private users or other governmental agencies involved in the transit
system cannot be counted on to tackle the problem, nor can the manufacturers
or vendors of computers and other electronic equipment. Many companies
are not sure what will happen with their systems. Others are unable, or
unwilling, to provide a cure. Even recently purchased hardware and software
cannot be assumed to be Y2K-compliant; check it.

<P>Finally, even if your hardware and software are able to handle the turn
of the millennium, if the data has been entered with only two digits to
represent the year there may be trouble lurking. The systems may work,
but the data may not.

<P>Here are some transportation areas that may be troublesome on January
1, 2000:
<ul>
<P><li><B> Intelligent Transportation Systems:</B> Increased use of ITS may pose
a major problem. Among uses that are vulnerable: timed or coordinated traffic
signals; 'smart tags' or 'smart cards' that use dates, such as an expiration
date; information kiosks and automated vehicle message signs; and some
public safety systems as vital as 9-1-1 or as routine as an accident-mapping
project. So concerned is the federal government about ITS, it scheduled
a national summit meeting for the summer of 1998 to discuss the problem.</li>

<P><li><B> Integrated Transportation Systems:</B> The entire intelligent transportation
infrastructure is at risk as integrated systems made up of both new compliant
and old non-compliant component systems must interact and communicate.</li>

<P><li> <B>Advanced Traveler Information Systems:</B> Any scheduled services--subways,
buses, trains, or planes--could be felled by a Year 2000 malfunction of
date-sensitive computer systems. Schedules may be confused, route maps
may disappear, and staffing plans could be snarled. Dispatchers may be
scrambling to make error-free manual schedules.</li>

<P><li><B>Traffic Management Systems:</B> These systems measure and report traffic
levels throughout metropolitan areas. The Millennium Bug problem has a
potential impact on data derived from these systems and used for traffic
reporting and control and emergency management purposes.</li>

<P><li><B>Traffic Signal Control Systems:</B> According to John McCracken of the
Federal Highway Administration, "Many of these systems which are centralized,
closed loop, and distributed either run on a time-of-day mode or use a
time-of-day mode as a back-up to a real-time or traffic-responsive mode
of operation."</li>

<P><li> <B>Freeway Management Systems:</B> Driving could become a minefield of interruptions
and accidents. Bridges, tunnels, toll booths, ramp metering, electronic
lane markers, and rush-hour traffic signals rely on computers for timing.
Video images derived from these systems could produce incorrect dates on
shots of freeways and arterials.</li>

<P><li> <B>Automatic Vehicle Location Systems:</B> A preview of the problems will
come August 22, 1999, when the worldwide global positioning system (GPS),
a set of satellites installed by the U.S. Navy to provide pinpoint-precise
navigation and time of day, will experience its own anomaly. According
to the Navy, "Some receivers (of GPS services) may display inaccurate date
information; some may also calculate incorrect navigational solutions."
It is a somber possibility, since thousands of ships, planes, missiles,
weekend explorers, and recently, new cars rely entirely or in part on the
GPS.</li>

<P><li> <B>Smart Goods-Movement Systems:</B> Movement of goods and freight involves
a vast system for keeping track of inventory and moving goods on time.
Date-sensitive computer systems are everywhere, from the private warehouse,
to the city's industrial terminal, to the state's seaport.</li>

<P><li> <B>Emergency Management and Dispatch Systems:</B> Failure to fix the Y2K
problem in this area may result in loss of connectivity with outside law
enforcement and civil defense agencies, loss of life, danger and damage
to personal and business property if emergency notification systems fail,
and liability caused by all of the above.</li>

<P><li> <B>Air Safety:</B> The air traffic control system presents the most frightening
doomsday scenario. Both the air traffic control system and the airplanes
themselves are highly computerized and may rely on embedded date-sensitive
systems. The FAA is addressing the problem aggressively, but the task is
huge. The airlines themselves face Y2K hazards. Without the appropriate
fixes, their records for aircraft maintenance and repair, for crew scheduling,
for plane reservations, and for such mundane operational chores as payroll
and accounting could become tangled. Some airlines are considering grounding
their planes at midnight on December 31, 1999.</li>

<P><li> <B>Water, Rail, and Trucking:</B> Similar problems face maritime shipping,
rail yards, and the trucking industry. Such small systems as those operating
railroad crossing gates could fail-with disastrous results. Schedules and
inventory records could become snarled.</li>

<P><li> <B>In-Vehicle Systems:</B> Some automobiles have systems that keep track
of the last time the car was serviced and provide route guidance. They
may set off premature warnings on New Year's Day, 2000. Newer engines rely
on computer controls with 'embedded chips,' and no one is certain how they
will react.</li>

<P><li> <B>Records:</B> If a state licensing department does not respond to the Y2K
challenge, driver's license records and vehicle registrations that expire
in the year 2000 might be rejected by computers. Rental company computers
may reject driver's licenses or credit cards with the offending year.</li>

<P><li> <B>Your Desk:</B> What happens if the personal computer on your desk and
all those others around it do not work correctly after midnight of the
millennium? Consider all the information stored in those computers essential
to your transportation department, and take steps to ensure that these
systems are all part of your jurisdiction's Y2K efforts.</li>
</ul>
</dir>

<a name=liabilities>
<P><font face=arial><B>Legal Liabilities</B></font>
<dir>
<font face=arial size=2>
<P>The potential effects of the Year 2000 problem seem likely to create
an environment in which legal action will thrive. So far, with no lawsuits
filed, there are no court decisions and no case law. But there will be.

<P>Warren Reid of Encino, Calif., a legal consultant specializing in Y2K
issues, told clients in a recent white paper: "Failing to fix your upcoming
Year 2000 problems can not only cause disruption and loss of market share,
productivity, and profitability in your company, but will expose the company
and you to class-action lawsuits, possible loss of coverage from insurance
companies, malpractice for professionals, and director and officer liability-a
grand slam!"

<P>Several states have passed laws to protect private business and state
agencies from just that kind of legal action related to the Y2K problem.
Despite those efforts, and despite the fact that the Year 2000 problem
is a technical problem with a technical solution, your city or county attorney
should be aware of legal risks.
</font>
</dir>

<a name=side>
<P><font face=arial><B>On The Technical Side</B>
<dir>
<font face=arial size=2>
<P>Solving the Year 2000 problem is not technically difficult, even for
cases involving embedded microchips.
<BR>There are five recognized solutions:
<ul>
<P><li> <B>Conversion:</B> The only fix that is complete and permanent is also the
most obvious: Convert every date to a four-digit year, following International
Standard Organization ISO 8601, adopted by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), which calls for all dates to be entered as "yyyy-mm-dd."
Hence, March 31, 1998 would be entered and stored as 1998-03-31.</li>
</ul>

<P>This approach offers a complete, permanent fix that will change all
data records and every application using them. It also is the most intuitive
fix. But it requires extensive program and file conversions. Every program
in an application must be checked for significant data use and converted;
then the entire application has to be converted from its previous form
to its new form all at once. Existing data must also be converted all at
once, including all active, archived, and security files. This approach
also demands a significant amount of new storage space, roughly a 7 percent
increase. It takes the most time (of which many are already in danger of
running out) and is the most costly.

<ul>
<P><li> <B>Fixed Windowing</B>: Creating a 100-year window, such as 1936 to 2036,
can give computers and software a way to decide which century is appropriate
for a date. If the two-digit year is greater than 36, say 47 or 99, then
the program assumes the century digits to be 19; if the two-digit year
is less than or equal to 36, the century digits are assumed to be 20. This
approach requires no change in data, but it provides only a temporary fix.
At best, it buys some time. It works only until its appointed time runs
out, and at that point it will require reprogramming.</li>

<P><li> <B>Sliding Windowing:</B> This is like fixed windowing, with one significant
difference. The 100-year window is calculated from the current date. Each
year the software using sliding windows will adjust (slide) the 100-year
window one year forward. This approach requires no changes in data, only
in date processing routines, and the same code can be used for many years.
Production programs, for most applications, can be gradually converted,
and they can adapt year after year without reprogramming. If the 100-year
window is well selected, it may be permanent and cheaper than ISO 8601.
Thus, sliding windowing offers many local governments the fastest, most
reliable, and least costly way of dealing with the Y2K problem.</li>

<P><li> <B>Encryption:</B> It is possible to use binary arithmetic to compress dates
expressed with four-digit years to occupy the same storage space as those
with two-digit years. This approach gives the permanence of full date conversion
without the need for more storage capacity. But it requires extensive reprogramming
and is not intuitive.</li>

<P><li> <B>Encapsulation:</B> The Gregorian calendar has an interesting quirk: it
repeats every 28 years. Because the Y2K problem is related to six-digit
dates at the turn of the century, encapsulation simply resets the calendar
to 28 years earlier. The computer and its programs do calculations based
on a 20th century date and then add the 28 years back in for display purposes.
This approach gives a quick fix for situations where the source code is
lost or time has run out, but it does not account for religious holidays
that do not follow the Gregorian calendar. In the end, encapsulation may
be useful only in embedded process controllers in which the actual year
is not important, but the day of the week is very important.</li>
</ul>
<P>A strategy for putting the appropriate technical fixes in place might
look like this:
<ul>
<br><li> Inventory all automated systems and equipment;</li>

<br><li> Test to determine which will be compliant and which will not;</li>

<br><li> Prioritize the results;</li>

<br><li> Find out what remedies to apply;</li>

<br><li> Determine which applications can be fixed on time; and</li>

<br><li> Develop contingency plans for those that can't be fixed on time.</li>
</ul>
<P>Carrying out this strategy is complicated by two factors. The first
is that there are many related areas to find and fix. In numerous cases,
application software was developed on a custom basis, or at least heavily
customized, to handle local government business practices. These custom
applications can be difficult to maintain, and some are too old to change.
Even a medium-sized local government or business could have millions of
lines of program code, any of which might use dates. Invalid date comparisons
could crop up in programs, training, embedded processors, or data. Beyond
the computer hardware and software, there are also all those other systems
and devices that are controlled by microchips.<P>

The other complicating factor is time. It takes time to make all the
necessary changes. The inventory alone for a medium-sized organization
could take six to nine months, up to twice as long for a large one, according
to some experts. And that is only the computers and software. It may take
another three months to inventory all equipment that uses embedded chips.
Once the code that needs fixing is identified, maybe 70 to 80 percent can
be updated automatically. The rest will have to be read, a line of code
at a time, by programmers, and manually changed. At an average rate of
3,000 lines of code a day, that is not a quick job either. With the Year
2000 right around the corner, time is running out, and the deadline cannot
be extended.

<a name=coping>
<P><font face=arial><B>The Cost of Coping</B></font>
<dir><font face=arial size=2>
<P>The time and money it takes to solve Y2K problems in your local government
or in your community will very likely be available only at the expense
of other improvements and other projects. Solving the transportation-related
Y2K problems will add costs to your local government's overall burden in
addressing Y2K. How much resistance the cost meets depends, in part, on
how much advance consideration there was of the transportation issues,
and how thoroughly the problems were identified and inventoried as the
local government assessed its Y2K tasks. Obviously, the fewer surprises
the better.

<P>There are options, such as the variety of reprogramming solutions discussed
previously, each of which carries a different price. The option of replacing
older systems before the turn of the century also might become more attractive
after a sober look at the cost of fixing the existing system. Whatever
the decision, this much is certain: It is not something that can be delayed
or postponed. Time grants no reprieves.

<P>Solving the problem requires reprogramming, replacing, or retiring older
'legacy' computing systems-the mainframes and minicomputers that were the
mainstays of computing before the advent of the personal computer. It also
requires that newer computer systems be checked as well as other systems
that use microchips, such as elevator controls and security systems.

<P>The exact cost of doing that will depend on the size of the city and
the extent of its use of information technology. Seattle estimates it will
spend more than $50 million to reprogram major applications affected by
the problem and replace the city's accounting system. Some cities are fortunate
to have recently launched major information technology plans that will
replace old systems with new ones in time to avoid the Year 2000 problem.
In these cases, many of the Y2K compliance costs are covered by funds budgeted
for system improvements in the overall city budget.

<a name=conclusion>
<P><font face=arial><B>In Conclusion</B></font>
<dir><font face=arial size=2>

<P>The Year 2000 problem presents potentially serious repercussions for
the public and private transportation systems on which all of us depend.
The burden of fixing the problem falls to government and cannot be shirked.
Fixing the problem is not difficult technically; computer experts know
the solutions and how to perform them. But those solutions take time and
money.

<P>The first step, identifying the problem, takes both technical expertise
and a thorough and thoughtful look at the entire range of transportation
systems and the supporting casts of computer hardware, software, data,
and automated systems. The checklist that follows is a general outline
for action for local officials and transportation experts.

<ul>
<li> Fix: requires appropriate technical skill.
<BR><li> Replace with compliant hardware: Replacement is an expensive option,
but it may be the only realistic one for many systems. It also become riskier
as we get closer to 1/1/2000.
</ul>

<BR><li> <B>Fix or replace software.</B>
<ul>
<li> Fix the code: requires access to code and appropriate technical skills.
<BR><li> Replace with compliant custom or off-the-shelf software.
<BR><li> Outsource (at least temporarily) the process to a service bureau
whose system is compliant.
<BR><li> Live with cosmetic problems or minor inconveniences until they can
be finally fixed.
</ul>

<BR><li> <B>Fix or replace embedded systems and interfaces.</B>
<ul>
<li> or replace systems as appropriate are directed to automated systems
in elevators, water systems, and building security systems.

<ul>

<P><li> Make the Y2K problem a priority for both your transportation department
and your city or county Y2K team.
<P><li> Put a transportation expert with wide experience and understanding
in charge of the problem. That expert should work with information technology
professionals, as well as with the administrators and department heads
who must be made aware of the scope of the problem.
<P><li> Make sure transportation is high on your government's Y2K agenda.
<P><li> Budget sufficiently to solve the problem.
<P><li> Have the city attorney research legal ramifications of Year 2000
failures.
<P><li> Pay particular attention to both moving and static systems that depend
on the global position system, which could create similar difficulties
four months before the Year 2000 arrives.
<P><li> Spread the word about the impending problem.
<P><li> Provide a central source of information on the Y2K problem accessible
to transportation analysts, businesses, and vendors who deal with transportation,
government agencies, and the general public. A Web site, or a page on the
city/county Web site, is a good mechanism that provides the flexibility
needed to direct users to both general and highly technical information.
<P><li> Make sure local businesses that might be affected by Year 2000 transportation
problems are aware that the city or county government is working on solutions.
<P><li> Make sure transportation users and vendors of transportation-related
systems are aware of the need to become compliant.
<P><li> Investigate areas of data exchange or system dependency between the
government and private transportation users. For example, will everyone
be using four-digit year numbers by the turn of the century?
<P><li> Share information, resources, and solutions.
<P><li> Make operational changes within your offices.
<P><li> Use four-digit dates. Some software can handle the Year 2000 if it's
entered as four digits, and consistent use of four-digit dates will avoid
confusion later.
<P><li> Train staff to know where Y2K problems can arise and to spot them
when they do.
<P><li> Be prepared to replace what cannot be fixed.
<P><li> Make contingency plans for systems, processes, and data that can't
be compliant in time; consider outsourcing (temporarily, at least, to compliant
service providers).
