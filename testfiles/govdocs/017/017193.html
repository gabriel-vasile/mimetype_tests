<p><a name="A"><font size="4">Is the football draft rational?</font></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National Football League’s annual player draft is one
of the more interesting job-matching institutions. As an additional benefit to
analysts, it is a relatively transparent mechanism with well-defined rules and
widely reported outcomes. Cade Massey and Richard H. Thaler in their National
Bureau of Economic Research (<font size="2">NBER</font>) working paper <i>Overconfidence
vs. market efficiency in the National Football League</i> investigate how
efficient the draft might be from an economic perspective and what might be
behind any inefficiencies from a decision-making perspective.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their economic conclusions are that earlier draft choices are
irrationally costly in two respects. First, the team bidding up in the draft
order generally gives up a more valuable set of picks from later in the draft
and, second, the earlier draft picks are paid quite a bit more when they sign
with the team. Although earlier picks are higher performers, Massey and Thaler
find that the fall-off in performance is not nearly as steep as the decline in
price as the draft progresses. Furthermore, the value of a player in terms of
compensation relative to performance actually increases as the first round of
the draft unfolds. That is, &quot;late-first-round picks generate more value
than early-first-round picks.&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the psychological underpinnings of this inefficiency go, Massey and
Thaler describe the possibilities as &quot;an embarrassment of riches&quot;:
nonregressive predictions (predictions about player value are more extreme and
varied than the available evidence shows), over-confidence (people’s belief
that their knowledge is more precise than it really is), the &quot;winner’s
curse&quot; (winning bidders are more likely to be those who have overestimated
a value), and false consensus (the tendency to believe that others’
evaluations are more similar to one’s own than is the case).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Innovation, most observers would agree, is a fundamental
driver of technological progress. Thus, it would seem, innovators are an
important resource. It is disconcerting, therefore, to discover in Benjamin F.
Jones’ <font size="2">NBER</font> working paper <i>Age and great invention </i>that
&quot;individual innovators are productive over a narrowing span of their life
cycle, a trend that reduces—other things equal—the aggregate output of
innovators.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jones examined the great achievements—those that merited
Nobel prizes or mention in the standard almanacs of technology—and determined
the age at which the innovators made their first contributions. That age,
according to Jones, had risen by about 6 years over the course of the 20th
century. While part of the trend could be attributed to the general aging of the
population, the basic driver was &quot;a substantial change in the life-cycle
productivity of innovators. Specifically, the age at which the young begin their
innovative careers has risen by approximately 8 years. Meanwhile, there has been
no compensatory increase in creative potential beyond early middle age.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jones attributes the increase of the age at which great
innovation occurs to the fact that innovators must build in previously accreted
knowledge and thus must necessarily allocate a great deal of their early careers
to education. This is a theme Jones explores at greater length in another
working paper, <i>The burden of knowledge and the &quot;death of the Renaissance
man&quot;: Is innovation getting harder? </i>That paper explores the manifold
implications of the increasing body of knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If knowledge accumulates as technology progresses,
  then successive generations of innovators may face an increasing educational
  burden. Innovators can compensate by seeking narrower expertise, but narrowing
  expertise will reduce their individual capacities, with implications for the
  organization of innovative activity—a greater reliance on teamwork—and
  negative implications for growth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &quot;burden of knowledge,&quot; according to Jones, explains not only
the increasing age at great innovation noted in his earlier paper, but also the
increasing prevalence of academic collaboration and the lengthening of the time
to complete doctorates. And, of course, the narrowing of expertise is, by
definition, &quot;the death of the Renaissance man.&quot;</p>
