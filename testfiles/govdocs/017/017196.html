        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Travel Security</b></font></p>
        <p>Most of the security resources you can depend on at
        the office and at home are nonexistent when you travel.
        Your greatest security asset is yourself - take
        precautions, vary your routines, keep a low profile, and
        be alert to suspicious people and circumstances.</p>
        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Risks of Vehicle Travel</b></font></p>
        <p>Passenger vehicle travel has many inherent security
        risks. Vehicles are easily recognized by year, make, and
        model. The criminal knows specifics about how to gain
        entry as well as operation of security devices. Cars can
        be followed discreetly, with a very low risk of
        detection. You may not know you were targeted until its
        too late. Vehicles are often parked in public areas with
        no control or protection, affording easy access to
        intruders. Criminals who assault a vehicle rely heavily
        on the element of surprise. They aim to catch the victim
        &#147;off balance&#148; and scare them into acting
        irrationally. The shock of a car jacking attack is
        greatest at points of changing surroundings, such as
        entering or exiting.</p>
        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Daily Travel Precautions</b></font></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel in a group whenever possible. </li>
            <li>Never overload a vehicle, all persons should use
                seat belts. </li>
            <li>Keep the vehicle in good mechanical repair. </li>
            <li>Don&#146;t let the gas tank get too low. </li>
            <li>Install a vehicle alarm to discourage tampering,
                or use a steering wheel club. </li>
            <li>Keep the ignition key separate from other keys,
                never leave the trunk key or other keys with the
                parking attendant. </li>
            <li>Do not hide a spare key under the floor mat or
                under the hood. </li>
            <li>Always park in areas that are locked or attended,
                avoid parking on the street overnight. </li>
            <li>Inspect the vehicle carefully before entering,
                look for evidence of tampering, but do not touch
                any suspicious items. Check the hood latch,
                exhaust pipe, trunk latch, fender wells, tires,
                gas cap, and finally the underside of the car. </li>
            <li>Do not leave windows down, or doors unlocked. </li>
            <li>If the car breaks down, raise the hood and tie a
                white cloth to the door handle. Remain inside
                with doors locked, if someone stops to offer
                assistance ask them to call for help. </li>
            <li>Never pick up hitchhikers. </li>
            <li>Know your route and the locations of secure
                places along that route. </li>
            <li>Have a car phone or CB-radio. Communicate
                frequently, let others know your location and
                destination and when you are expected to arrive. </li>
            <li>Use public transportation where available. When
                taking taxis, make sure the driver uses the most
                direct route, yet follows any directions you
                give.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Emergency Procedures When in
        a Vehicle</b></font></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review mental preparations of what you would do
                were an attack to take place. </li>
            <li>Be alert to possible surveillance, if you suspect
                you are being followed, go to the nearest secure
                public place. </li>
            <li>Avoid driving in the far right-hand lane when
                possible to prevent being forced over. </li>
            <li>Be aware of minor incidents that could block
                traffic along your route. If you see a suspicious
                road block or detour, take an alternate route. </li>
            <li>Try to carry a portable phone, and have it
                accessible for emergency calls. </li>
            <li>Inform another person of your travel plans, so
                they will expect you at a certain time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Going Out of Town</b></font></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restrict travel plans to a need to know basis. </li>

            <li>When traveling abroad, carry a civilian passport
                as well as an official one. Keep the official one
                in checked luggage, memorize the passport number,

            <li>Know who to contact if you should lose any
                official documents, or credit cards or if they
                are stolen. Report such losses immediately. </li>
            <li>After using a credit card, make sure you get it
                back, your receipt, and the carbons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#0000B7"><b>Staying in Hotels</b></font></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make your choice of hotels and rental cars low
                key. </li>
            <li>Keep your room key or card on your person when

                same place. </li>

                out of place when you come back. </li>
            <li>Check the locations of emergency exits and fire
                extinguishers. </li>
            <li>Don&#146;t admit strangers to your room. If you
