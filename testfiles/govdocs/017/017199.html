	  <p>Looking back to 2020, it's not too hard to see how the world reverted 
		to such a dark period. Some of us can remember back to the turn of the 
		millennium, when irrationally exuberant economic optimism prevailed. Despite 
		a few early trouble signals, the Internet-stoked stock market kept rising. 
		People were growing richer and richer. Eventually everybody, climbed on 
		the bandwagon. People were spending anticipated stock market gains for 
		ever bigger houses and sport utility vehicles.</p>
	  <p>Strong signals warning of significant trouble began early in the 00's. 
		Energy demand increased unabated, so oil prices continued to soar. China, 
		already a grain-importing nation, stepped up imports. Farm prices rose 
		steadily. Spot food shortages were occurring in unexpected places in the 
		developed world. Other dynamics were at work. It turned out that the Asian 
		financial crisis of the late 90's had only been superficially resolved. 
		Apparent institutional reforms in Asian finance and government proved 
		to be illusory. Asia's economic problems had returned, significantly reducing 
		their demand for U.S. products. Prosperity in the United States was not 
		as solid and guaranteed as many thought. India, the so called &quot;back office 
		of America,&quot; was rapidly becoming the front office as well. Highly skilled 
		Baby Boom workers began to retire in droves. Dot-coms were just not doing 
		that well anymore. They weren't creating sufficient efficiency gains in 
		actual production of goods. And in retrospect, the most ominous threat 
		was Russia. The great Motherland never recovered economically after the 
		collapse of communism. Owing to the lack of real, economic opportunity, 
		the &quot;Russian Mafia&quot; continued to grow. Their criminal activities became 
		a measurable drain on a number of the world's largest economies. The illegal 
		drug trade increased. Biological weaponry and nuclear warheads of the 
		former Soviet Union continued to disappear, leading to great political 
		and strategic uncertainty. These myriad factors led to some savvy investors 
		pulling out of the market. Big institutional investors followed suit. 
		In 2005, the financial bubble finally burst.</p>
	  <p class="ltSans">[ <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> ]</p>
	  <p>Stock markets around the world crashed, immediately setting off a chain 
		reaction of negative economic and social events. Because of the massive 
		nature of the economic decline, nations immediately started blaming one 
		another and closing their borders. All the old barriers to trade made 
		a comeback as countries circled their wagons in isolationism. The net 
		effect was to prevent any type of economic recovery. The slowdown eroded 
		the economic status of the U.S. middle class. What made it harder in the 
		United States was that this economic distress coincided with the beginning 
		of Baby Boomer retirement. The United States was left with a boom of seniors 
		who could no longer contribute to the economy and were becoming a drain 
		on the social and medical resources of the country just when times were 
		bad. Of course the slowdown was far more painful and disruptive in the 
		developing world, throwing a very large number of people back into the 
		grinding poverty from which they had only recently emerged. The population 
		growth rate in the developing world, which had finally started to decline, 
		rose again as the prosperity that led to declining birth rates disappeared.</p>
	  <p>Internationally and domestically the gap between rich and poor was growing. 
		Large numbers of the newly desperate were trying to emigrate to the United 
		States, where the economy seemed better.</p>
	  <p>Other social consequences of the worldwide economic slowdown were considerable. 
		The poor began to rage against the rich, creating a general atmosphere 
		of blame and intolerance. People's sense of community narrowed greatly 
		to focus only on their own clubs, churches or neighborhoods. Gated communities 
		for those who remained wealthy multiplied. The Western world withdrew 
		its relatively recent commitment to fight AIDS in Africa. As a generation 
		of Africa's best died, the disease spread faster in Asia and was more 
		and more evident in immigrants to the United States.</p>
	  <p class="ltSans">[ <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> ]</p>
	  <p>The environment didn't fare too well during these dark days. Population 
		growth in the poorest parts of the world led to increased deforestation 
		and soil erosion, problems that had once been on the verge of being solved. 
		People lost any will to deal with climate change. Many of the alternative 
		and energy efficient technologies that were nearing implementation were 
		delayed until well over the horizon. The Kyoto Protocol was voted down 
		once and for all. By 2010, climate change related disasters became more 
		recognizable and common. Storm surges flooding Island Nations led to environmental 
		refugees landing on our shores. Droughts and floods worsened leading to 
		further hardships and more environmental refugees.</p>
	  <p>This was even a period when hard-won progress on such basic environmental 
		improvements as air and water quality was lost. No funding was available 
		to repair the aging water infrastructure of the nation's oldest and largest 
		cities. Inner cities, which had been on the verge of revival, crumbled 
		again. Cities were once again abandoned. The nation lacked the will to 
		shut down the last of the coal burning power plants. In fact, a few moth-balled 
		coal-fired plants were brought back into production to avoid importing 
		oil.</p>
	  <p>Examples of specific health, environmental, and social impacts likely 
		to be associated with this scenario are listed below.</p>
	  <p class="ltSans">[ <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> ]</p>
	  <p class="subheadGreen">Water</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Waterborne diseases, pathogens increase</li>
		<li>Further degradation in water quality due to uncontrolled nonpoint 
		  source pollution</li>
		<li>Significant financial needs associated with maintenance and improvements 
		  to water infrastructure are ignored</li>
		<li>Huge increases in human and animal waste as population increases</li>
		<li>Absence of economically achievable and innovative technologies for 
		  waste treatment/disposal</li>
		<li>Drugs people use appear in water supply as waste products</li>
		<li>Water shortages lead to conflict</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="subheadGreen">Chemicals</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Increased invasions of novel organisms require use of more pesticides</li>
		<li>Indoor exposures worsen without progress/innovation in materials</li>
		<li>Unexpected synergistic effects between chemicals occur</li>
		<li>Industry continues to produce a significant number of new chemicals 
		  about which little is known</li>
		<li>Endocrine disruptors result in decreased reproductive capabilities</li>
		<li>Developing countries make abundant use of chemicals banned in commerce 
		  in developed countries</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="ltSans">[ <a href="#top">Back to Top</a> ]</p>
	  <p class="subheadGreen">Sprawl</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Significant cycle of deterioration in older, larger cities</li>
		<li>&quot;McMansions&quot; become unaffordable and more new, modest neighborhoods 
		  are built</li>
		<li>No comprehensive transportation solutions are developed</li>
		<li>Developments lead to reservoir contamination</li>
		<li>Localized flooding increases as absorption capacity of landscape decreases</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="subheadGreen">Biotechnology and Nanotechnology</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Minimal progress made in transforming technologies</li>
		<li>Most technical progress limited to national security/weapons and is

	  <p class="subheadGreen">Climate</p>

		<li>Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, but have partially abated
