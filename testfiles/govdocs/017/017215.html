designating expert witnesses, Hoffman designated an expert, and the\
Company moved to strike the designation.  The court granted the\
Company\'s motion to strike, a ruling from which Hoffman now\
appeals.  Because, however, we affirm the grant of summary judgment\
to defendants, we need not review the status of Hoffman\'s witness\

the summary judgment would still stand.</p>\

U.S. 317, 324 (1986), in which the Supreme Court stated, </p>\
<br>\
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 1.5in">[w]e do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce\
evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in\
order to avoid summary judgment.  Obviously, Rule 56 does\
not require a nonmoving party to depose her own\
witnesses.  Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment\
motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary\
materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings\
themselves, and it is from this list that one would\
normally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing\
to which we have referred.</p>\
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">&#160;</p>\
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">In context, however, the quotation addresses the specific point in\
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Celotex</span> that a nonmoving party who bore the burden of proof on a\
dispositive issue could rely on her own affidavits and the\
"depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions <span style="text-decoration: underline">on file</span>"\
without having to depose her own witnesses.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> (quoting Rule\

var WPFootnote4 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Paragraph 11 of the affidavit focuses on Exhibit E:</p>\
<br>\
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 1.5in">While Defendants contend that they did not fire me\
because of my age, it is clear that their stated reasons\
for firing me are not true and are pretextual.  Moreover,\
Exhibit E attached hereto is powerful affirmative\
evidence of age discrimination by Sevier, Robinov and\
Paradigm....Exhibit E shows that Paradigm\'s age\
employment profile is skewed to the point where a\
conclusion of age discrimination can clearly and cogently\
be found.  Buttressing this conclusion is the fact that\
the sole Paradigm employee, except for Sevier, over 50,\
Stephen Fisk, is classified as a Maintenance\
Administrator, and is the practically irreplaceable\
technician/engineer who takes care of Paradigm\'s\
production machinery.  He should be exempted from any\
general salaried employee list, just as have been the\
Applicators\' shareholders, one half of whom are retired. \
If Mr. Fisk were excluded along with Sevier and now\
Hoffman, Paradigm, would show -0- employees over 50 out\
of 263 total and 28 salaried; while the balance of the\
Company would show 12 over 50 out of 159 total and 55\
salaried.  Such a discrepancy is clear evidence of age\
discrimination.</p>\

wholesale distributor that sells building products to professional
contractors.  Part of Applicators' business included manufacturing
windows under a franchise agreement with a national company.  At
some point, Applicators decided to end its relationship with the
franchisor in order to start a new venture with its own products. 
This new venture resulted in the creation of defendant Paradigm
Window Solutions ("Paradigm").  Defendant Sevier is Paradigm's
General Manager.  A semi-autonomous division, Paradigm makes and
distributes windows under its own name and for a private label.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Before joining the defendants' company, Arnold Hoffman
was employed for seven years by MBF Windows in Portland, Maine.  He
served as the head of MBF's Portland operation, performing a wide
range of duties, and supervised one or two employees at any given
time.  Responding to an advertisement for an outside sales position
at Applicators, Hoffman submitted his resume to the company in
March or April of 2000.  He interviewed first with defendants
Robinov and Sevier and two other employees.  They did not explain
much about the position because Applicators had not yet announced
plans to sever ties with its franchisor.  About three weeks after
the first interview, Hoffman was called in for a follow-up
interview and offered the job, which would be with the new entity,
Paradigm.  He accepted and began work in May 2000.  He was 54 or 55
years old when he began with the company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Sevier was Hoffman's supervisor throughout his employment
at Paradigm.  Hoffman viewed Sevier as an irrationally demanding
supervisor, and the relationship between the two deteriorated over
time.  Hoffman testified in his deposition that Sevier "was a very
poor manager [who]&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;motivated by intimidation and
negative&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;comments, not by positives and encouragement."  He
also wrote in a letter to Jerry Robinov, one of the founders of
Applicators, that "Most of the salesmen hate dealing with [Mr.
Sevier] and will do everything they can to avoid him.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;&#160;I am
not the first employee to have experienced [Mr. Sevier's] wrath or
his poor personnel management skills.  I'm sure I won't be the
last."  He testified that "it was a general consensus behind
[Sevier's] back that people did not like him.  They didn't like the
way he treated them." </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hoffman was very successful in sales, achieving a 56
percent sales increase in his last fiscal year of employment, an
increase which the Company's Sales Manager, Steve Zerbinopolous,
acknowledged as unmatched.  His May, 2002 performance evaluation
rated him as "exceeds requirements" (a score of 4 on a scale of 1-5) for problem solving, communication, initiative, and innovation
and rated him as "meets job requirements" (a 3 on a scale of 1-5)
for quantity of work, job knowledge, planning/organizing,
adaptability, and cost consciousness.  He was given a rating of
"needs improvement" (a 2 on a scale of 1-5) in the categories of
managing people, judgment, safety awareness, and leadership.  He
received a merit pay increase after that evaluation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>On May 22-23, 2003, Hoffman underwent another annual
performance review.  In the written review, Sevier was critical of
Hoffman's performance and declined to grant him a merit pay
increase.  Hoffman and Sevier agreed to meet on August 29, 2003 for
a follow-up, at which time Hoffman's performance would be re-evaluated and a determination would be made about whether to
increase Hoffman's salary.  In the performance review, Hoffman
received a rating of "meets job requirements" in problem solving,
adaptability, dependability, communication, innovation, appearance,
cost consciousness, and safety.  He was given a rating of "needs
improvement" in the categories job knowledge, judgment, leadership,
and training.  The overall rating stated:</span></p>

your territory and time.  It appears as [though] you have
not systematically scheduled to visit your accounts and

You need to make dramatic improvement in these areas.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">Hoffman sent Sevier a written rebuttal to his criticisms
immediately following the May review.  Sevier responded in writing
to the rebuttal and reiterated his plan for the August review. 
Hoffman sent Sevier a second rebuttal on June 22, 2003.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>On or about June 25, 2003, Hoffman and Sevier had a
dispute about the status of a work-related project.  Hoffman missed
a deadline for the production of sell sheets for window products,
and Sevier became impatient with Hoffman's attempts to explain the
reason he missed the deadline.  Hoffman argued that the sell sheets
were substantially complete but for information that was to be
supplied by Sevier and the inclusion of a few photos which, Hoffman
claimed, Hoffman or a photographer "could have taken in an
afternoon."  Sevier lost his temper with Hoffman, and, on June 27,
2003, the Company terminated Hoffman's employment.  Scott Frazier,
a long-time Company employee, assumed Hoffman's position about
three months after Hoffman's termination.  Frazier was less than
forty years old at the time he was promoted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The district court, reviewing the defendants' motion for
summary judgment, assumed arguendo that the plaintiff had made out
a prima facie case of employment discrimination.  The court also
found that the defendants had put forward a legitimate reason for
his termination (the flawed 2003 performance review and the June
25, 2003 missing of a project deadline).  Addressing next whether
Hoffman had carried his burden to establish that the defendants'
stated reason for termination was a pretext for age discrimination,
the district court found that Hoffman had not introduced sufficient
evidence to establish that it was such a pretext.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hoffman relied on what he called "Exhibit E," attached to
his Offer of Proof, a chart which purported to summarize the number
of employees at Applicators and Paradigm and of those over the age
of 50 at each division.  The district court struck Exhibit E from
the summary judgment record on the grounds that it was inadmissible
because it was not properly authenticated and was based on data
that had not been authenticated or presented in the summary
judgment record.  Further, the district court noted, the accuracy
of the information in Exhibit E had not been sworn to under oath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The district court concluded that without Exhibit E,
Hoffman had not placed in the record any evidence of age
discrimination or age-based animus and held that no rational fact-finder could infer from the record as it existed an employment
action based upon age discrimination.  The court entered summary
judgment for the defendants on the age discrimination claim and
remanded the remaining two state claims to the Maine state court. 
This appeal followed.</span></p>

Exhibit E was not admissible because it was not authenticated and
was based on data not authenticated or presented in the summary

been admitted as it was a tabulation of "documentary evidence
provided in discovery by Defendants."  Hoffman says the tabulated
data in the Exhibit demonstrates age discrimination because it
shows that Paradigm employed only one person over the age of fifty,
while twenty-two percent of Applicators' employees were over fifty. 
The Exhibit consists of a chart with attached explanatory notes
purporting to list the total number of employees at Paradigm and
Applicators and breaking down the number of salaried employees and
the number of salaried employees over fifty years of age.  A
footnote states that some employees have been excluded from
consideration in the calculations.  Other footnotes to the chart
indicate that the data therein is based on disclosures provided by
the defendants in document discovery at pages D492 through D509. 
Exhibit E's preparer is not named, and the cited underlying pages
of documentary discovery are neither attached to Exhibit E nor
included elsewhere in exhibits or attachments filed by either party
in connection with the summary judgment motion or opposition.  </span></p>

the district court's assertion, echoed by defendant appellees in
their brief, that the discovery documents allegedly underpinning
Exhibit E were not presented to the district court.  Indeed,
nothing in the docket below indicates the discovery documents
referenced in Exhibit E had in any manner been filed with the
court.  Hence, to have located them, the court would have had to
initiate a search going beyond any of the documents filed with the
case.  Only on appeal has Hoffman, for the first time, submitted
several Bates-numbered pages from the defendants' discovery
disclosures listing employees and their birthdates and dates of
hire.</span>

tendered may not actually have been before the district court, they
reflect data disclosed by the defendants themselves during
discovery.  Moreover, he asserts, the disclosures would be
admissible at trial as business records.  Therefore, Hoffman says,

not automatically become a part of the record simply because they
are the products of discovery.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) ("[s]worn

document on which [the plaintiff] relies for its market share
figures was not submitted as part of the summary judgment record,

consider matters disclosed during discovery, he must take
appropriate steps to have them included in the record: merely
citing to pages of discovery materials not of record does not
suffice.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hence, whatever argument Hoffman may have had for
admission of Exhibit E as a "chalk" grounded on data found in
defendant appellees' business records, required that the discovery
documents containing such records be brought first before the
court, by being placed in the summary judgment record.  Where that
was not done, the district court did not abuse its discretion in
not seeking out the referenced documentation on its own and in
rejecting the Exhibit.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> 11 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's
Federal Practice &sect; 56.10 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) ("Courts generally
accept use of documents produced in discovery as proper summary

admissible as, in essence, a "chalk" accurately summarizing the
Company's own employment information.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Patrick</span>, 248 F.3d 11, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).  Without having the
discovery disclosures before it, the district court was in no
position to determine if Exhibit E properly reflected admissible
data.  A chalk "must be fully supported in all respects by
corroborating admissible evidence."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Morse</span>, 491

248 F.3d at 25.  Even supposing arguendo such corroborating

held that documents supporting a motion for summary judgment could
not be considered because they had not been properly authenticated.

authenticating affidavit complying with Rule 56(e) is required
under summary judgment, <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span>, Hoffman argues that he submitted a
"fully conforming Offer of Proof and Affidavit."  Rule 56(e),
however, as already noted, requires that the affidavit be made on
personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible in
evidence, and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to
testify to the matters stated therein.  Moreover, "sworn or
certified copies of all papers" referred to in the affidavit must
be attached.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span>  </span></p>

the affidavit is based on his personal knowledge, but he makes no

lawsuit under the ADEA, the plaintiff's age must actually have

had a determinative or motivating influence on the outcome.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Reeves</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133, 141

"an ADEA claimant must adduce evidence that: (1) [he] was at least
forty years of age; (2) [his] job performance met the employer's
legitimate expectations; (3) the employer subjected [him] to an

prima facie case of age discrimination and found that the
defendants had put forward a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis
for Hoffman's termination: his performance review and the missed
project deadline.  Having excluded Exhibit E as inadmissible, the
court found that Hoffman had "placed in the summary judgment record
no other evidence of age discrimination or of any age-based
animus."  The only facts even suggesting age discrimination were
that Hoffman was over forty when he was terminated and his
replacement was slightly under the age of forty.  Offset against
this, however, was the fact that Hoffman was over fifty years old
when he was initially hired.</span></p>

cited <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reeves</span> for the proposition that a pretextual reason for
termination without other evidence of a motivation based on age-bias can be enough to defeat summary judgment.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at

conclude that the employer unlawfully
discriminated.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160; This is not to say that such a
showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to
sustain a jury's finding of liability.  Certainly there
will be instances where, although the plaintiff has
established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient
evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no
rational factfinder could conclude that the action was
discriminatory.</span></p>

absence of <span style="text-decoration: underline">any</span> persuasive evidence of a motivation based on age-bias, is precisely that case which the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reeves</span> Court excluded from
its rule."  Later in the opinion, the court also wrote that "[o]n

evidence countering the employer's termination reason, let alone
any admissible evidence to believe Plaintiff's claim that any
consideration of age motivated his discharge."  </span></p>

proffered reason for terminating him was pretextual.  This
characterization is not easily squared with the court's own
statement ("The record is devoid of any credible evidence that
Defendants' employment actions were a pretext for age
discrimination.").  But in any event, pretext or no, we do not find
on de novo review sufficient evidence to support a finding that age
discrimination was a factor motivating the termination.  Hoffman
argues that the evidence shows defendants' complaints about his
work performance were "blatant fabrications."  However, his
performance evaluation indicated that he struggled in some areas. 
Immediately before he was fired, he had missed a deadline for the
completion of a project, a mistake in character with one of the
criticisms outlined on his performance evaluation.  He himself,
moreover, described Sevier as an irrationally demanding and
difficult manager to work with.  Evidence of their deteriorating
relationship suggests that bad feeling may have been another
ingredient in Sevier's decision to discharge him.  What is lacking
is evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that age
discrimination was also a factor.  We believe that regardless of
whether the defendants' stated reasons for termination could be
found to be pretextual, no factfinder could rationally conclude
from the record before the district court that the termination--whatever its precise motivation--was motivated by discrimination
based upon Hoffman's age.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reeves</span>, 540 U.S. at 147. </span></p>
