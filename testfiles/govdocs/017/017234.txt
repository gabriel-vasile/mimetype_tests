   DANIELS, Board Judge. 
 
        AT&T  Corp., Network Systems  Division (AT&T), protests that
   the Department  of the Air  Force's award  of a contract  for the
   supply of  telecommunications systems to  NORTEL Federal Systems,
   Inc. (NORTEL),  violated statute and regulation.  Among the seven
   counts of protest, AT&T maintains  in Count I that the  Air Force
   misevaluated NORTEL's "post-cutover" pricing scheme and  in Count
   II  that the agency  misevaluated the awardee's  cost performance
   risk.
 
 
        In cross-motions,  NORTEL, an  intervenor of  right in  this
   case,  maintains that these  two counts  were untimely  filed (or
   alternatively, that  neither of  them  states a  valid basis  for
   protest), and AT&T  urges us  to grant  it summary  relief as  to
   Count I  and consequently as  to the  entire protest.   We  grant
   NORTEL's  motion in  part, dismissing  Count I  in part.   AT&T's
   motion is denied.
 
                            Findings of Fact
 
        1.   The  procurement  in  question is  known  as  the North
   American Standards Integrated  Digital Telecommunications Systems
   acquisition.  This procurement is part of an Air Force program to
   replace  outdated telephone  switching  systems  with the  latest
   commercially-available digital integrated voice, data, image, and
   video  information switching  systems  at  Air  Force  and  other
   Department  of  Defense  installations.   Complaint    13; Answer
     13.
 
        2.   The   solicitation   called    for   the   engineering,
   furnishing, installation, and testing of an estimated 130 systems
   at specified sites  -- two for  certain and the  remainder on  an
   indefinite   delivery,   indefinite  quantity   ordering   basis.
   Complaint    16; Answer    16.   Ordering  of systems  was to  be
   possible  over  a  five-year period,  and  ordering  of follow-on
   support  was  to be  permitted  for  an  additional three  years.
   Protest File,  Exhibit C-1 at  1 of Executive Overview  (Apr. 22,
   1993).
 
        3.   The  solicitation required  the Air  Force  to award  a
   contract "to the  responsible Offeror whose offer,  conforming to
   the solicitation, will provide the best value to the Government."
   Protest File, Exhibit C-2 at 116 of 121.
 
        4.   Each proposal was to be  evaluated in five "areas."  In
   descending order  of  importance,  the  areas  were  engineering,
   management, logistics, cost, and schedule.  Protest File, Exhibit
   C-2 at 116 of 121.
 
        5.   The  Air  Force's  source  selection  evaluation   team
   concluded  that  in  all  areas  except  cost,  "both  [offerors]
   provided strong proposals."  Taking  the four non-cost areas as a
   whole, however,  the team rated  AT&T's proposal  as superior  to
   NORTEL's.   Protest  File,  Exhibit  E-6 at  24-25.   The  source
   selection  authority  relied  on this  conclusion  in  making his
   decision to award  the contract to NORTEL.  Id. at 47a; Statement
   of Uncontested Facts in Support of Protester's Motion for Summary
   Relief,  Respondent's  Statement   of  Disputed  Facts   (jointly
   referenced hereafter as "Uncontested Facts")   26.
 
        6.   The solicitation stated that  the cost area  evaluation
   would be  divided into  two components, an  evaluated cost  and a
   performance  risk  rating,  which would  be  given  equal weight.
   Protest  File,  Exhibit C-2  at  116  of  121.   Each  cost/price
   proposal was also  to be evaluated for "completeness, realism and
   reasonableness."   A  cost  realism analysis  would  be made  "to
   determine if the overall costs  in the proposal are realistic for
   the work  to be performed,  reflect a clear understanding  of the
   requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the
   offeror's technical proposal."  Id. at 120 of 121.
 
        7.   The solicitation  explained that "[f]or the  purpose of
   comparing the evaluated  costs, a total estimated  contract price
   will  be established for each  proposal using the methodology set
   forth   in  Appendix   D  to   the   PPI  [Proposal   Preparation
   Instructions]."    Protest  File,  Exhibit  C-2  at 120  of  121.
   Appendix D stated that "[t]he Total Estimated Contract Price, for
   proposal  evaluation purposes, will  be estimated by  summing the
   price   for    all   initial   systems,   model    systems,   and
   CLINs/SLINs/ELINs  [contract   line  item   numbers/subline  item
   numbers/exhibit  line  item   numbers]  as   discussed  in   this
   Appendix."  Id.,  Exhibit D-7 at 1  of Appendix D.   The appendix
   states  that for  each CLIN from  1000 to 9999,  "pricing for the
   Offeror defined CLINs is accounted  for in the initial system and
   model  system DOPs  [delivery order  proposals]."   Id. at  10 of
   Appendix D.
 
        8.   Appendix  D  additionally stated,  "For  administrative
   purposes,  the  total estimated  amount of  the contract  will be
   calculated  by  adding  [two  specified]  amounts  to  the  Total
   Estimated Contract Price."  Id.   These amounts were "(1) $75,000
   per  site  to  account  for  possible  installation  of  In-House
   Distribution Systems . . . and over-and-above efforts . . . , and
   (2) 20% of the [total  proposed prices for line items  related to
   initial and  model system  deliveries] to  account for  potential
   system      reconfiguration,      upgrade,      and     expansion
   efforts. . . ."[foot #] 1     Protest   File,   Exhibit  D-7   at
   1  of  Appendix  D;   Uncontested  Facts    19.     The  Proposal
   Preparation Instructions stated that the total estimated contract
   amount was to  be determined "for proposal  evaluation purposes."
   Protest File, Exhibit D-7 at 34.

        [foot #] 1     During the  planning of this  acquisition, in
   estimating a  total value which  the contract awarded  under this
   procurement  would  have, the  Air Force  included an  amount "to
   cover the  estimated amount  of system  upgrades, expansions  and
   reconfigurations of the  systems after they are cutover."   Based
   on  experience  gained under  two  programs, the  agency  used "a
   factor of 20 percent of  the total system acquisition costs . . .
   to  project potential amounts  needed for upgrade,  expansion and
   reconfiguration  of  the  system after  cutover."    The computed
   figure was $__________.  Protest File, Exhibit E-1 at 23.
 
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE ENDS -----------
 
 
 
        9.   NORTEL's proposal contained  a specific category called
   "Extension Pricing," which was applicable to "items ordered for a
   system after initial cutover for the system."   Uncontested Facts
     22.   The  Air Force  considers  that "cutover"  occurs when  a
   particular  system  is  installed  and  accepted.    Respondent's
   Statement of  Disputed Facts    23.   Thus, items  ordered "post-
   cutover"  include  all those  for  reconfiguration,  upgrade, and
   expansion  of installed systems.  Each NORTEL-proposed line item,
   from  1000 through  7999,  contained  extension  pricing,  and  a
   substantial   number   of    these   post-cutover   prices   were
   significantly  higher  than   NORTEL's  pre-cutover  prices   for
   identical  line items.   Under  the  contract, if  the Air  Force
   orders any  of these  items for a  system at  any time  after the
   system  has been  installed, it  will have  to  pay substantially
   higher prices  for the  same line items  than pertained  prior to
   cutover.  Uncontested Facts    22, 23.
 
        10.  The  Air  Force  evaluated  NORTEL's  total   estimated
   contract  price as $262,605,585,  and AT&T's as  $___________, or
   ____    percent    higher   than    NORTEL's.[foot #] 2       The
   source selection authority  determined that some of  the benefits
   of  AT&T's proposal have  measurable cost savings,  but that "the
   additional benefits . . . [do] not justify the additional costs."
   He  consequently decided that  NORTEL's proposal offers  the best
   overall value to  the Government.  Protest File,  Exhibits E-6 at
   46a-47a, E-7.
 
        11.  The Air Force's cost evaluators also added to the total
   estimated contract price  for each  offeror, as  per Appendix  D,
   $75,000 per site and twenty  percent of the total proposed prices
   for  line items related  to initial and  model system deliveries.
   Thus, they  added $9,750,000  to each  offeror's price, and  also
   added  $34,942,717 to NORTEL's  price and $__________  to AT&T's.
   The total estimated amount of  the contract was thus, for NORTEL,
   $307,298,302;  and for AT&T, $___________.  Protest File, Exhibit
   E-6 at 33.  Of the last two figures, AT&T's is $__________ higher
   than NORTEL's.
 
        12.  The  Air   Force's  cost  evaluators   understood  that
   NORTEL's   extension   prices   "will    be   used   for   system
   reconfiguration, upgrade and  expansion."  Protest  File, Exhibit
   E-18 at 4.   Nevertheless, in evaluating  NORTEL's cost proposal,
   the Air Force did not at all evaluate the proposed "post-cutover"
   pricing.   Uncontested Facts    31.  The  Air Force also  did not
   perform  any realism  analysis of  reconfiguration, upgrade,  and
   expansion  costs  to  compare  the costs  of  such  effort  using
   NORTEL's pre-cutover pricing  to the costs  of such effort  using
   NORTEL's post-cutover pricing.  Id.   38.  Nor  did the Air Force
   compare the costs of reconfiguration, upgrade and expansion using
 
                                                                    
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE BEGINS ---------
 
        [foot #] 2     AT&T's price is actually  ____ percent higher
   than Nortel's.
 
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE ENDS -----------
 
 
   NORTEL's  post-cutover pricing  to the  independent  estimate the
   agency had earlier made.  Id.   40; see n.1.
 
 
        13.  The twenty percent  amount calculated by the  Air Force
   under  Appendix  D  instructions  for potential  reconfiguration,
   upgrade, and expansion (Finding 11)  was made using NORTEL's pre-
   cutover prices.  Protest File, Exhibit E-6 at 33.  According to a
   consultant retained by protester, if the agency had made the same
   calculation using NORTEL's post-cutover prices, the  result would
   have  been  $__________  --  $__________  more  than  the  agency
   determined.  Affidavit of Kevin L. Martin (Dec. 29, 1994)   8.
 
        14.  The Air  Force assigned  NORTEL's cost  proposal a  low
   performance risk.   The agency did not take NORTEL's post-cutover
   pricing  into account  in making  this  assessment.   Uncontested
   Facts   46.
 
                               Discussion
 
        Under  the rubric  of Count  I,  "Misevaluation of  NORTEL's
   Post-Cutover Pricing Scheme," AT&T alleges that the agency failed
   properly to evaluate NORTEL's post-cutover prices by irrationally
   applying the estimating  methodology set forth  in Appendix D  to
   the Proposal  Preparation Instructions; failing to  find NORTEL's
   pricing materially  unbalanced; and  failing to  perform a  "most
   probable  cost analysis"  which assessed  the reasonableness  and
   realism of the cost to the agency of accepting NORTEL's proposal.
   In Count II,  AT&T contends that the Air  Force improperly failed
   to  perform  any  performance  risk  to  NORTEL's  cost  proposal
   attributable to the firm's post-cutover pricing arrangement.
 
        The motions filed  by AT&T and NORTEL raise  questions as to
   the nature  of the  Air Force's commitment,  as expressed  in the
   solicitation, to evaluate cost proposals.
 
        Appendix  D required  the  Air Force  to  make two  separate
   calculations as to the cost of proposals; the  agency had to find
   both a "total  estimated contract price"  and a "total  estimated
   amount of the contract."  The former figure was to be used "[f]or
   the purpose of  comparing . . . evaluated costs"; the  latter was
   variously required to be used "[f]or administrative purposes" and
   "for proposal evaluation  purposes."  Findings 7, 8.   Neither of
   these figures, according  to the Appendix's instructions,  was to
   reflect   post-cutover  prices  proposed  by  an  offeror.    The
   directions  for calculating  the total  estimated contract  price
   said so directly.  Finding 7; see also Finding 9.  The directions
   for the total  estimated amount of the contract did  so, as well,
   in that they established a formula for taking  into consideration
   potential costs of  reconfiguration, upgrade, and expansion,  and
   the formula was  keyed to proposed prices for  line items related
   to initial and model system deliveries.   Finding 8.  Thus,  with
   regard to both total estimated contract price and total estimated
   amount  of the  contract, the Air  Force acted  consistently with
   requirements  it placed  on itself  when it  did not  include the
   higher post-cutover prices included in NORTEL's proposal.  
 
 
        To the  extent that AT&T may be objecting  in Count I to the
   Air  Force's failure  to  consider  the  post-cutover  prices  in
   calculating  NORTEL's  total estimated  contract  price or  total
   estimated amount of contract, it  is in effect objecting that the
   instructions  contained in  Appendix D  make  no sense.   Such  a
   complaint  would only  be timely,  under our Rule  5(b)(3)(i), if
   filed before the closing time  for receipt of proposals.  Because
   this  challenge  was  filed  well  after  that  time,  as  NORTEL
   suggests,  it is  untimely.   NCR Corp.,  GSBCA 9787-P,  89-1 BCA
     21,499,  at 108,323-24, 1988 BPD   331, at 12-13; Command Corp.
   of West Virginia, GSBCA 9747-P, 89-1 BCA   21,455, at 108,117-18,
   1988 BPD    310, at 6-7;  Babcock & Wilcox d/b/a  Power Computing
   Co., GSBCA 9531-P, 88-3 BCA    20,987, at 106,031, 1988 BPD   150
   at 3-4.
 
        Simply  calculating the  offerors' total  estimated contract
   prices and total estimated amounts of contract in accordance with
   Appendix D, however,  was not the only requirement  the Air Force
   imposed  on itself  for analyzing  the  cost impact  of accepting
   either of  the offerors'  proposals.   The agency also  obligated
   itself to evaluate the realism  of the costs associated with each
   proposal, and to  assess the risk that performance  of a proposal
   could be had at the evaluated prices.  Counts I and II  of AT&T's
   protest assert  that neither  of these tasks  was completed  in a
   rational way.   These allegations  pertain to matters  which AT&T
   could not have  known about prior to  the debriefing at  which it
   maintains it learned  of them.  The protest was  filed within ten
   days  of that debriefing.   Count II,  and Count I  to the extent
   that  it contains assertions other  than the one dismissed above,
   are timely.  Rule 5(b)(3)(ii).
 
        The Air  Force has  admitted that it  did not  evaluate cost
   realism  or  assess  performance  risk  as  to  NORTEL's  higher,
   "extension"  prices for  line  items  ordered  after  cutover  --
   notwithstanding   the   agency's   understanding   that   if   in
   reconfiguring, upgrading, or expanding a system after cutover, it
   orders  these items,  it  will  have to  pay  the higher  prices.
   Findings 12, 14.  On its face, this admission appears to place in
   doubt the validity of the cost evaluation  -- certainly as to one
   of the two equal components, performance risk, and also as to the
   other  evaluated  cost,  to  the  extent  that  the  cost realism
   analysis  should have  had an impact  on it.   DALFI, Inc., GSBCA
   8755-P,  87-1 BCA    19,552, at  98,808, 1986  BPD   228,  at 25,
   reconsideration denied, 87-1  BCA   19,584, 1987  BPD   15.   The
   fact  that the  higher  prices were  not  included in  stipulated
   calculations does not  mean that the agency cannot  reasonably be
   expected to pay  them.  Because  the agency anticipates  spending
   tens  of  millions  of  dollars after  cutover,  Finding  8  n.1,
   ignoring  the higher  prices  completely  appears  to  have  been
   irrational.
 
        The  extent  to  which NORTEL's  higher  post-cutover prices
   should   have  affected  the  realism  of  the  calculated  total
   estimated contract price  and total estimated amount  of contract
   is  far from  clear, however.   Based  on the  fragmentary record
   developed at this  point in the case,  we do not know  how AT&T's
   consultant developed his calculation of the real cost of NORTEL's
   proposal, or whether his figure has any relationship to the costs
   one  could reasonably  expect  the  Air Force  to  incur under  a
   contract with NORTEL.  See Finding 13.   A consultant retained by
   the  agency  has  suggested  a reason  which,  if  proven,  would
   indicate that the higher prices  should have little impact on the
   cost realism and performance risk of NORTEL's proposal:
 
             The Air Force  has no notion of  the specific
             items,  components,  or   systems  that  will
             require   reconfiguration,   upgrade   and/or
             expansion or  when such  efforts will  occur.
             Further,  given  the   rapid  advancement  of
             technology,  it  is  highly likely  that  the
             reconfiguration,  upgrade  and/or   expansion
             will   involve   components   that   are   in
             development  or  will  be  developed  in  the
             future.   Only  a small  portion  of the  20%
             estimate  was  intended  to  be  . . .  items
             presently on the subject contract.

   the    parties     disagree    vigorously    as     to    whether

   __  ________.     If,  as  the  Air  Force   and  Nortel  assert,
   ____________ ______________________________,  this could  have an
   impact on the realism and  performance risk of that proposal, and
   consequently on the relative standing of the offerors as to cost.
 
        In short, the  case is far too complex  and problematical at
   the present time for us to conclude, as AT&T wishes, that because
   AT&T's technical proposal was higher rated than NORTEL's (Finding
   5),  and according to  its consultant's calculations,  the NORTEL
   proposal  would ultimately prove more expensive to the Government
   (Findings  11, 13),  award  should have  been made  to AT&T.   We
   therefore deny AT&T's motion for summary relief.
