   Before Board Judges PARKER, HYATT, and VERGILIO.
 
   PARKER, Board Judge.
 
        Travel  Centre,   appellant,  maintains  that   the  General
   Services Administration  (GSA), respondent,  breached a  contract
   under  which Travel  Centre  was  to  provide  travel  management
   services  to federal  agencies in  the  states of  Maine and  New
   Hampshire.   The contract  was breached, according  to appellant,
   because  GSA knew at the  time the contract  was awarded that the
   estimates provided by  GSA of the amount of  business which could
   be  expected under  the contract,  and upon  which  offerors were
   required to base their proposals,  were vastly overstated.  Thus,
   appellant  argues,   GSA  knowingly  misled  Travel  Centre  into
   entering into a contract under which Travel Centre was certain to
   lose money.  As discussed below, we agree with Travel Centre that
   GSA breached the contract.
 
                            Findings of Fact
 
   The Solicitation
 
        On  April  21,  1995,  GSA  issued  a solicitation  for  the
   establishment and  operation of  a travel  management center  for
   federal agencies  located in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont for
   the period from October 1,  1995 through September 30, 1996, with
   four one-year  option  periods.   The  solicitation  contemplated
   award  of  an  indefinite   quantity,  indefinite  delivery  type
   contract,  with a  guaranteed minimum  revenue  of $100.   Appeal
   File, Exhibit 2.  Essentially, the winning contractor would serve
   as a  preferred, but not  mandatory, source for  federal agencies
   that required airline tickets, lodging, rental vehicles, etc. for
   their employees.  The winning contractor would not be paid by the
   Government to perform these services, however; compensation under
   the contract would be in the form of commissions  received by the
   contractor from  the carriers,  hotels and  car rental  companies
   from which the services were procured.   Id. at 27.  The  winning
   contractor  would be  required to  rebate  a percentage  of these
   commissions to the Government.  Id. at 30.
 
 
        Section  B-2  of  the  solicitation  offered  the  following
   caution to prospective offerors:
 
             IMPACT   OF   NON-MANDATORY  USE   ON   SALES
             ESTIMATES:
 
             Sales estimates, agency  names, and any other
             information in Section H,  is provided solely
             for  informational  purposes,  and  does  not
             represent any guaranty  of sales.  It  is not
             known how many  Federal agencies will  choose
             to utilize this contract, and it is not known
             how much business this contract will generate
             for the Contractor.
 
   Appeal File, Exhibit 2 at 8.
 
        Section  H  of  the   solicitation  provided  the  following
   information:
 
             ITEM 1:   STATE OF MAINE
 
                  . . . .
 
             FY94 DATA:     4,156 TICKETS
                            $1,861,700    ANNUAL    DOLLAR
             AMOUNT
             (Sources:   GSA forms 3531 and current agency
             customer list)
             Offerors  shall base  their  offer[s] on  the
             above illustrated FY94 figures.
 
             The  following   table  is   for  information
             purposes only and  it does not represent  any
             guaranty  of sales, it  does not list  all of
             the Federal  agencies located  in the  state,
             and  it  does  not  reflect  any  commitments
             received  by  GSA from  the  Federal agencies
 
             (listed  below or  otherwise) to  utilize any
             contract resulting from this solicitation.
 
             [A  table  of  requirements, broken  down  by
             individual  agency,  followed.    There  were
             numerous errors contained in the table.]
 
   Appeal File, Exhibit 2  at 30a.  The parties agree  that 2,186 of
   the  tickets and  $992,900  of  the  annual  dollar  amount  were
   attributable to  Maine Air  and Army  National Guard  (MEANG) and
   Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
 
   GSA's Knowledge of Expected Business
 
        In  December 1994, GSA received a "Monthly Narrative" report
   from Dube  Travel,  the incumbent  contractor  for the  state  of
   Maine.[foot#] 1  The narrative informed GSA that
 
             The Department of the Army has solicited bids
             for   19   states  including   Maine,   which
             encompasses all of the National Guards' units
             worth  $121,000,000.00   It has  been  won by
             Carlson Travel, along  with it's [sic]  other
             five  contracts.  They  are due to  take over
             the Army  National Guard account  in February
             1995.
 
   Appeal File, Exhibit 55.   The information was repeated in Dube's
   monthly reports  received by GSA  in January and February.   Id.,
   Exhibits 56, 57.
 
        In  preparing  for  the   current  solicitation,  respondent
   contends  that it conducted  a telephone survey  during February-
   March 1995 of potential federal  customers for the new  contract.
   Appeal File,  Exhibit 67.    Telephone records  for the  relevant
   period, however, show  at most one call, on April  6, 1995, which
   could  possibly have  been made  in connection  with a  telephone
   survey.  The forty-four  other agencies which were  customers for
   the  predecessor contract apparently  were not contacted  at all.
   Id., Exhibit 78.  GSA  has stipulated that its "limited telephone
   survey of potential  customers prior to issuance of  the 1995 RFP
   [request for  proposals] was  inadequate to  properly update  the
   survey data used in the 1994 solicitation."  Stipulation 8.
 
        Travel  Centre submitted  its  proposal  on  May  24,  1995.
   Stipulation 21.  On June 27, the agent for MEANG issued  a notice

                                                                    
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE BEGINS ---------
 
   [foot #] 1 During the predecessor  contract, most federal agencies
   were required to use GSA contracts as mandatory sources for their
   travel agency requirements.   This situation changed  between the
   award of  the predecessor contract  and the contract at  issue in
   this  appeal;  GSA became  a  "preferred provider"  instead  of a
   "mandatory source."  Appeal File, Exhibit 100.
   of termination of  travel services, effective August  20, to Dube
   Travel.   On August 15, Travel Centre  submitted a best and final
   offer.   On September 18,  GSA received a Monthly  Narrative from
   Dube Travel that stated:
 
 
             With the  Camp  Keyes  being  taken  over  by
             another larger out-of-state  agency on August
             20, 1995, we are no longer servicing the Camp
             Keyes  accounts  which   includes  Maine  Air
             National  Guard  units,  and  the  U.S.  Army
             Battalion and Recruiting units.
                                                                    
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE ENDS ---------

 
   Appeal  File, Exhibit 59.  On October  10, GSA requested a second
   best and final offer from Travel Centre.  Id., Exhibit 7.  Travel
   Centre submitted  an amended best  and final offer the  same day.
   Stipulation 25.
 
        During this whole  process, GSA never said a  word about the
   information that it  had received about the MEANG  and DoD units,
   notwithstanding the  fact that  these units  generated more  than
   half of the expected business in Maine.  GSA  has stipulated that
   "the incumbent contractor's notification of a competing source of
   supply should have prompted GSA  to make further inquiry into the
   matter."  Stipulation 24.
 
   Contract Award and Subsequent Events
 
        On October 25, 1995, GSA awarded to Travel Centre a contract
   for travel  management services for  the states of Maine  and New
   Hampshire (appellant was  not awarded the contract  for Vermont).
   Shortly after it began performance of the contract, Travel Centre
   learned  that   the  MEANG   and  DoD   agencies  would  not   be
   participating in the  contract.  Appeal File, Exhibit  66.[foot #]2  
   When expected revenues did  not materialize, Travel Centre  closed 
   its business. Appellant's Record  Submission and Brief,  Exhibit A.
   On June 21,  1996, GSA terminated the contract for  default.  GSA
   changed the default termination to one for the convenience of the
   Government on  April 30,  1997.  Stipulation  35.   Travel Centre
   filed its claim for  breach of contract on October  21, 1996 and,
   on January 2, 1997, appealed the GSA contracting officer's denial
   of that claim.  The parties  have requested that the Board decide
   only the issue of entitlement.
 
                               Discussion
 
                                                                    
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE BEGINS ---------
 
   [foot #]2  Although  GSA maintains  that Travel Centre  knew about
   the  Carlson  Travel  contract  prior  to  contract  award,  this
   contention is not supported in  the record.  Travel Centre admits
   to hearing  about a large  contract award to Carlson  Travel, but
   maintains that it had no idea that Carlson's contract covered the
   same  agencies covered  by  GSA's  solicitation.    Appeal  File,
   Exhibit 66 at 25-28.  There is no evidence to the contrary.
 
                                                                    
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE ENDS ---------


        Travel  Centre contends that  GSA breached the  contract for
   travel services because GSA knew or should have known at the time
   of award  that the  estimates provided  by GSA  of the  amount of
   business which  could be  expected under the  contract, and  upon
   which offerors were required to base their proposals, were vastly
   overstated.  We agree.
 
        There are many  factors which enter  into the assignment  of
   risk of a bad Government estimate.  Among these are the potential
   for  economic injury  to  the contractor,  the  form of  contract
   chosen and the degree to  which the estimating process itself was
   defective.   S & W  Tire Services, Inc.,  GSBCA 6376, 82-2  BCA  
   16,048.
 
             An  estimate as  to a  material  matter in  a
             bidding   invitation    is   an    expedient.
             Ordinarily it is  only used where there  is a
             recognized need for guidance to bidders on  a
             particular point but  specific information is
             not  readily available.   Intrinsically,  the
             estimate that  is made in  such circumstances
             must   be  the   product  of   such  relevant
             underlying information as is available to the
             author of the invitation.  If the bidder were
             not entitled  to so regard  it, its inclusion
             in the invitation would be surplusage at best
             or deception  at worst.    Assuming that  the
             bidder  acts reasonably,  he  is entitled  to
             rely on Government  estimates as representing
             honest and  informed conclusions.   In short,
             in  promulgating  an  estimate  for  bidding-
             invitation  purposes, the  government is  not
             required to be clairvoyant  but it is obliged
             to  base   that  estimate  on   all  relevant
             information that  is reasonably  available to
             it.
 
   Womack v. United States, 389 F.2d 793, 801 (Ct. Cl. 1968).
 
        To  GSA's credit,  the agency  has  not attempted  to defend
   either the  accuracy of its estimate  or the manner in  which the
   estimate was constructed.   GSA argues that,  although the agency
   was negligent in preparing the estimate, it was not guilty of the
   "bad  faith"  necessary  to  constitute  a  breach  of  contract.
   According  to  GSA,  a termination  for  the  convenience  of the
   Government is the appropriate remedy.
 
        Courts   and  boards  of  contract  appeals  have  struggled
   mightily with the  question of where  to draw the line  between a
   breach  of contract by the Government and a legitimate use of the
   Government's  power  to  terminate  a  contract for  convenience.
   Prior to  1982, courts  consistently held  that terminations  for
   convenience would be  overturned only in cases of  "bad faith" or
   "abuse of discretion" on the part of the Government.  John Reiner
   & Co.  v. United  States,  325 F.2d  438  (Ct. Cl.  1963),  cert.
   denied, 377 U.S. 931  (1964).  In some  cases, the required  "bad
   faith" was  equated with  a specific  intent on  the part  of the
   Government  to injure  the contractor.    Kalvar Corp.  v. United
   States, 543 F.2d 1298 (Ct. Cl. 1976), cert. denied, 434  U.S. 830
   (1977).
 
 
        The  field was  muddied somewhat with  the Court  of Claims'
   decision in  Torncello v.  United States, 681  F.2d 756  (Ct. Cl.
   1982).   Torncello involved  a requirements contract  for various
   janitorial services.   The Navy, believing that one  of the items
   was  overpriced, performed  the  work in-house.   In  a plurality
   opinion, the court held that the Navy's failure to order the work
   constituted a  breach of  contract, not because  of bad  faith or
   abuse of  discretion  on the  part  of the  Navy, but  because  a
   termination  for  convenience  could  only  be   justified  where
   circumstances had changed after the contract was awarded.  Id. at
   772.  Since  circumstances had not changed after  award, the Navy
   could not rely on the termination for convenience clause to avoid
   a breach.
 
        The  limit on the Government's power to terminate a contract
   for  convenience established in  Torncello has been substantially
   eroded in  subsequent cases, most  significantly by the  Court of
   Appeals for the Federal Circuit  in Krygoski Construction Co.  v.
   United States, 94 F.3d 1537  (Fed. Cir. 1996).  In Krygoski,  the
   U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  terminated  for  convenience  a
   contract to demolish two buildings  when it found that the amount
   of asbestos which needed  to be removed was far in  excess of the
   amount which  had  been  estimated.   The  Corps  considered  the
   proposed price  increase of  about thirty-three percent  to be  a
   cardinal  change  and  decided  to  terminate  the  contract  and
   resolicit  based upon  the new  requirements.   In reversing  the
   Court  of Federal Claims'  award of  breach damages,  the Federal
   Circuit  rejected  the  Torncello  "changed circumstances"  test,
   holding that Torncello applies "only when the Government enters a
   contract with no intention of  fulfilling its promises."  94 F.3d
   at 1545.   The Federal  Circuit determined  that the  contracting
   officer,  by terminating the contract for  convenience to avoid a
   cardinal  change,  did  not  act   in  bad  faith  or  abuse  his
   discretion.
 
        Given the current state of the law, which seems  to be about
   the same as it was prior to 1982, we must determine whether GSA's
   termination  for convenience  of Travel  Centre's  contract as  a
   result  of a  severely deficient  estimate  was in  bad faith  or
   constituted an abuse of discretion.  As discussed below, we think
   that GSA did  breach the contract -- GSA's  actions in connection
   with the award of the contract demonstrated bad faith.
 
        Boards  of  contract  appeals  have  been   deciding  faulty
   estimate  cases for  a  long time.   Of  the  many confusing  and
   seemingly conflicting cases, the one that makes the most sense to
   us  in terms  of  application  to the  instant  case is  Atlantic
   Garages,  Inc., GSBCA  5891,  82-1  BCA    15,479.   In  Atlantic
   Garages, a faulty  estimate of the number of  vehicles that would
   need to be repaired during the  year suffered from the same basic
   defect  as the faulty  estimate here --  the Government's actions
   were sufficiently irrational as to support a finding that it knew
   or should  have known  that the  estimate  was not  based on  all
   relevant information.  Also, as here, the irrationally-arrived-at
   estimate (and the resulting lack of income) caused the contractor
   to lose money and fail to meet its financial obligations.
 
 
        The Board held that the Government's  actions in arriving at
   such an irrational estimate constituted a breach of contract:
 
                  The decisions establish that an estimate
             on  which   a  prospective   contractor  must
             necessarily base its prices is an estimate to
             which the  Government will  be closely  held.
             Although they  use the rubric  "due care"  or
             "good faith,"  which appears  at times  to be
             the sole basis  for the decision,  cases such
             as  Womack would  probably  have reached  the
             same result  regardless of the degree of care
             of  the procuring personnel.   But Pied Piper
             [Pied Piper Ice Cream, Inc., ASBCA 20605, 76-
             2 BCA   12,148] shows that other elements can
             also affect the result, such as the extent of
             the estimating error, the potential injury to
             the  contractor,  and   the  degree  of  care
             exercised  by  the   procuring  personnel  in
             carrying  out   their  responsibilities   for
             formulating accurate estimates.
 
                  . . . .
 
                  Whatever risks a contractor takes should
             not include the risk  that the contract  will
             be   based  on   an  irrationally   contrived
             estimate.
 
   Atlantic  Garages,  82-1 BCA  at  76,710.    We think  that  this
   analysis  makes  good sense  and  is not  inconsistent  with more
   recent cases such as Krygoski.
 
        Here, GSA's irrationally-arrived-at estimate  was not merely
   the result of a run-of-the-mill  mistake.  GSA awarded a contract
   to Travel Centre knowing (or recklessly disregarding  information
   that gave GSA every reason to  know) that the estimate was vastly
   overstated and  knowing that  Travel Centre,  in accordance  with
   GSA's direction,  had based its offer upon  the estimate.  By not
   telling offerors that half of the estimated sales for Maine would
   not be attainable,  GSA withheld crucial information  material to
   an offeror's decision whether to submit a proposal at all and, if
   so, how to  structure it.  Under such  circumstances, whether GSA
   actually knew about important additional relevant information, or
   recklessly disregarded  it (an explanation  which we do  not find
   credible but, in any event, amounts to the same thing), potential
   injury to Travel  Centre was present from the outset.   We reject
   GSA's argument  that such  behavior lacks the  bad faith  element
   necessary to sustain a finding of breach.
 
 
        GSA  argues  that,  since  (1)  the  contract   was  for  an
   indefinite  quantity, with a  minimum guaranteed revenue  of only
   $100, (2) there was no guarantee that  any of the listed agencies
   would actually use  the contract, and (3)  Travel Centre actually
   received more  than $100  in revenue, there  was no  breach.   We
   disagree.  First, we have  serious doubts that, even in  the case
   of  a true indefinite  quantity contract, the  contractor accepts
   the risk that the  Government has misled him as to  the amount of
   business  which   he  might   reasonably  expect.     In   normal
   circumstances,  a  contractor  assumes  that  the Government  has
   prepared  its estimate in good faith and accepts the risk that he
   may not achieve the level of sales estimated.  However, where the
   Government knows or has reason to know that the contractor has no
   chance of achieving the estimated quantity of sales, and fails to
   disclose that fact prior to  entering into the contract, the term
   "risk" is a misnomer.  The impossibility of reward for which  the
   contractor accepts the  risks of an indefinite  quantity contract
   is a certainty known  only to the Government.  In this situation,
   for the Government to argue that the contractor assumed this risk
   is absurd.3
 
        GSA's argument also  overlooks a crucial fact:   this was no
   ordinary  indefinite  quantity  contact in  which  the Government
   promises nothing more than to purchase the minimum quantity.  The
   solicitation told offerors  that the winning contractor  would be
   the  preferred  source for  federal  agencies in  the  region and
   required offerors to base their offers on the estimates provided.
   Thus,  although there  was no  guarantee of  a certain  amount of
   business  beyond the $100  minimum, the solicitation,  unlike the
   typical indefinite quantity contract, set up a situation in which
   the  likelihood  of   economic  injury  to  the   contractor  was
   considerable if GSA's estimate was defective.  By inducing Travel
   Centre to base its proposal on quantities that GSA knew or should
   have known  were overstated, GSA  breached its duty to  deal with

   [foot #]3  he situation  here is  analogous to  one which  arises
   most  often  in construction  cases  in which  the  Government is
   accused  of failing  to disclose  its superior knowledge  about a
   condition affecting performance.   The duty to  disclose superior
   knowledge applies in situations where (1) a contractor undertakes
   to  perform  without  vital  knowledge  of  a  fact that  affects
   performance costs or  duration; (2) the respondent was  aware the
   contractor had no knowledge  of and had no reason  to obtain such
   information;  (3) any contract  specification supplied misled the
   contractor, or  did not put it on notice  to inquire; and (4) the
   respondent failed to provide the relevant information.  Petrochem
   Services, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
   Travel Centre  fairly and  in good  faith.  In  other words,  GSA
   entered into the  contract "with no  intention of fulfilling  its
   promises."  Krygoski, 94 F.3d at 1545.[foot #] 4
                                                        
                   ----------- FOOTNOTE ENDS-------

        Finally, GSA   argues that the Government is not responsible
   for  the  consequences   of  the  faulty  estimate   because  the
   solicitation  told  offerors  that  the estimates  provided  were
   "solely  for informational  purposes."   This  argument, however,
   misses  the  mark.    It  is  well  established  that  where  the
   Government  requires   offerors  to   base  their   proposals  on
   information it provides, it may not absolve itself of risk merely
   by  labeling data supplied  in the solicitation  "for information
   purposes  only."   Cherry  Hill  Construction  Corp.  v.  General
   Services Administration, GSBCA 11217, 92-3 BCA   25,179.
 
        The dissent essentially argues that it is acceptable for the
   Government to award a contract which permits a contractor to sell
   his services within  a certain "territory," where  the Government
   knows prior to the award that the territory is far less vast than
   represented in the solicitation,  as long as the  Government puts
   in the contract  boilerplate language to the effect  that it does
   not guarantee any amount of sales beyond a stated minimum.  Thus,
   according  to the dissent, when  the contractor incurs the losses
   that  were  a  certainty  known   only  to  the  Government,  the
   contractor is  without recourse  because he  accepted the  "risk"
   that this would  occur.  If  a baseball team  sold the rights  to
   sell  beer during  baseball games,  telling the offerors  to base
   their offers on  last year's sales, and then  announced after the
   fact that the  team had previously decided  to move to  a stadium
   half the size next year, would we say that the vendor assumed the
   risk  that   the  team   owner  would   withhold  this   material
   information?  We should not do so here, either.

   VERGILIO, Board Judge, dissenting.
 
 
        My view  of the underlying  facts and case law  differs from
   that  of the  majority.  I  conclude that  the contractor  is not
   entitled to relief under its  contract; therefore, I dissent from
   the majority's decision.
 
        This  offeror  obtained  work in  excess  of  the guaranteed
   minimum.   Thereafter, it ceased  performance.  Rather than leave
   the default termination in place,  the agency converted it to one
   for the  convenience of the  Government.  Apparently this  was in
   recognition of the  possibility that the contractor's  failure to
   perform  may have  been  attributable,  at least  in  part, to  a
   failure  in communications  prior  to  award.   In  my view,  the
   findings do not support a conclusion  that agency actions leading
   to  the termination for convenience constituted  a breach of good
   faith.  Moreover, even if a breach did occur by the agency in the
   formation process,  the record  establishes  that the  contractor
   could not have  reasonably relied on the  information provided to
   now support  a demand of  entitlement to  relief.   In fact,  the
   majority finds  entitlement in  the  absence of  proof of  actual
   reliance on the solicitation figures  such that there is no basis
   to  conclude that  the  contractor was  affected  by the  alleged
   breach.
 
        The majority  posits the  issue to be  resolved as  "whether
   GSA's  termination for convenience of Travel Centre's contract as
   a result  of a  severely deficient estimate  was in bad  faith or
   constituted an abuse of discretion."  The contract was terminated
   (initially for  default and later converted to  a termination for
   the convenience of  the Government) because Travel  Centre closed
   its business during the contract period, after the Government had
   satisfied the minimum guaranteed under the  contract.  The agency
   fulfilled   its   obligations  under   the   indefinite-delivery,
   indefinite-quantity  (IDIQ) contract, as awarded.  48 CFR 16.501-
   2(b)(3)   (1995)   ("Indefinite-quantity  contracts   limit   the
   Government's  obligation to the minimum quantity specified in the
   contract").      Faced  with   a  non-performing   contractor,  a
   termination cannot be said to be in bad faith or to constitute an
   abuse of  discretion, if the agency had fulfilled its obligations
   up to that point in time.
 
 
        A  more fundamental  question underlies  this  appeal.   The
   contractor contends  that  the  agency  acted  in  bad  faith  by
   entering into the  contract with pricing based  upon solicitation
   information  which  the agency  knew  or  should have  known  was
   inaccurate.    The  contractor  asserts  that   the  solicitation
   overstates  the  potential  business attainable  under  the  IDIQ
   contract.   The contractor  maintains that  it  priced its  offer
   utilizing  the solicitation's  figures and  that correct  figures
   would  have  led to  a  different  contract.   As  a  result, the
   contractor concludes that it is  entitled to relief for an agency
   breach in the formation of the contract.
 
        The findings and  record fall short of  meeting the standard
   of  "well-nigh  irrefragable  proof"  required  to  overcome  the
   presumption of good faith dealing by the agency.  Kalvar Corp. v.
   United  States,   543  F.2d   1298,  1301-03   (Ct.  Cl.   1976).
   Presumptions and  assumptions unsupported  by the  record do  not
   justify  a conclusion  of bad  faith on  the part of  the agency.
   Lacking is an indication of an intentional or  deliberate attempt
   to mislead or an abuse of discretion.
 
        The information provided to the  agency by Dube Travel about
   military  entities was limited  in substance--the reports  do not
   indicate the  type, scope, pricing structure, or  duration of the
   underlying  contract(s) or the  potential impact on  the contract
   here  at issue.   The majority's findings are  not specific as to
   who  at  the  agency   reviewed  the  information,  and   if  the
   individual(s)  had any connection with this IDIQ solicitation and
   should have understood the potential impact on the available work
   under the  IDIQ  contract.   Moreover,  nothing  in  the  reports
   suggests that a  non-mandatory contract(s) was not  awarded, such
   that the contractor under the IDIQ contract may have been able to
   obtain business despite  the other contract(s).   While it  would
   not have  been improper for the agency to voluntarily pass on the
   information provided or  derivable therefrom (and the  agency may
   have been required  to reveal information if a  protest was filed
   demanding  current, realistic data), the findings do not indicate
   support for a conclusion of bad faith or an abuse of discretion.
 
        Even  if  one  assumes  agency  impropriety  in  withholding
   information  regarding the  military entities  (that  is, a  mis-
   statement   regarding    potentially   attainable    work),   the
   contractor's position  demanding breach  compensation is  fatally
   flawed in light of  the data in section H and the language in the
   solicitation.   The section H figures are internally inconsistent
   and,  therefore, patently  unreliable.   This  is so  because the
   individual  entries found  in section  H  associate for  specific
   agencies  or entities  a number  of official  travel  tickets, an
   annual dollar  amount, and other  data.  The  actual sums of  the
   entries for tickets  (3,100) and for dollar  amounts ($1,101,891)
   are not  the totals  identified  in the  solicitation: 4,979  and
   $1,601,891, respectively.  The contractor submitted  its proposal
   without  seeking clarification  of which  figures,  if any,  were
   accurate.  Further, while the parties may agree that 2,186 of the
   tickets  and   $992,900  of   the  annual   dollar  amount   were
   attributable to military  entities, the table for Maine  found in
   the  solicitation reveals subtotals  for these entities  of 1,285
   and $368,379, respectively.   At best, the  contractor could have
   anticipated  the work  identified in  the  solicitation, not  the
   figures now recognized by the parties.  Exhibit 2 at 30a-35.
 
 
        The  language of the solicitation further alerts offerors to
   the unreliability of  the data  and figures  in the  solicitation
   (ignoring the inconsistencies explained above) as an indicator of
   potentially attainable work.  This occurs in section B, where the
   solicitation highlights  that  a mandatory-use  contract will  no
   longer be in  place, such  that it is  unknown how many  agencies
   will  utilize  the  contract  and  how  much   business  will  be
   generated.    Exhibit  2  at 8  (  B-2).    Given  the  section B
   language, section H contains some mixed guidance.  It specifies a
   number of tickets  and annual dollar amount for  fiscal year 1994
   (FY94), said to be based upon "current agency customer list," and
   directs that  "Offerors  shall  base  their offer  on  the  above
   illustrated FY94 figures."  Also, the section highlights that the
   table  of figures  (discussed in  the paragraph  above)  does not
   reflect any commitments received by  GSA from agencies to utilize
   the IDIQ contract.  Id. at 30a.
 
        The  direction to  prepare proposals  utilizing  fiscal year
   1994 data for  an IDIQ contract with  a base year of  fiscal year
   1996 does not say to do so  without regard to the other terms and
   conditions of the contract.  The solicitation contains cautionary
   language regarding the  figures and estimates.  Just  as offerors
   are  directed to  price  options  for  evaluation  and  selection
   purposes, the  agency's failure  to exercise  an option  does not
   result in the repricing of the base contract.  While the majority
   reads the phrase as an absolute direction establishing the actual
   and reasonable reliance on  figures, the findings fail to  reveal
   any reliance in  fact.   It may be  that the contractor  obtained
   precisely the amount of work it assumed it would obtain under the
   contract.
 
        The  statement  that  the   solicitation  does  not   reveal
   commitments received alerts offerors to  the fact that the agency
   may  not be revealing  information it possessed--that  is, actual
   commitments.   Such information would  reflect current,  relevant
   data.   However,  offerors were  content to compete  without that
   information.  The language of  the solicitation in sections B and
   H make it patently obvious  that the information provided was not
   necessarily realistic or current at the time of award in terms of
   which agencies  would  (or  would  not)  be  utilizing  the  IDIQ
   contract.  Objections  to terms of a solicitation  must be raised
   before the  submission  of offers.  Having obtained  the award on
   the underlying competition, the contractor  is not in a  position
   to  object  to  the  lack   of  information  when  that  lack  of
   information was plain from the terms of the solicitation.
 
 
        Because  the  solicitation  contains  patently  inconsistent
   figures and  clearly states that  sales estimates do  not reflect
   known commitments of  agencies to utilize the IDIQ  contract, the
   agency's failure to provide that information cannot be challenged
   after-the-fact   and  viewed  as  a  compensable  breach.    This
   competitively awarded IDIQ contract should be viewed as are other
   IDIQ  contracts when the guaranteed minimum quantity was ordered.
   Dot  Systems, Inc.  v. United  States,  231 Ct.  Cl. 765  (1982);
   C.F.S. Air Cargo, Inc., ASBCA 40694, 91-2 BCA   23,985; DynCorp.,
   ASBCA 38862, 91-2 BCA   24,044.  I  find no reason to depart from
   the rationale of these decisions.   It is inappropriate to reform
   the  contract to  reallocate  risks  expressly  placed  upon  the
   contractor.   The guaranteed minimum  did not change because some
   entities entered into their own  contracts.  During the formation
   process,  this offeror  could have  sought  clarification of  the
   estimates and up-to-date information on potential users, or could
   have  decided  not  to compete  without  the  information.   This
   contractor, which  submitted an offer  in light of  the expressly
   limited amount of information, should not now benefit by shifting
   the risks under which it competed.
 
   Some further comments on entitlement
 
        Apart from my  finding no agency breach, if  one assumes the
   asserted breach, I  also disagree with the  majority's conclusion
   that the  contractor has demonstrated entitlement to relief.  The
   information  provided by  Dube Travel  does not  reveal the  type
   (IDIQ, mandatory use,  or other), pricing structure,  or duration
   of the contracts  of the Maine Air National  Guard and Department
   of  Defense entities.   The  majority has  not found  that Travel
   Centre's   prices  were  competitive  with  pricing  under  those
   contracts.   Further, the  majority has  not made  findings which
   indicate how Travel Centre priced its offer; thus, it is possible
   that it  priced its  offer based on  the level  of work  actually
   ordered under  the contract, such  that it did  not detrimentally
   rely on the sales estimates.  The majority assumes that an agency
   breach entitles a  contractor to recover, even in  the absence of
   detrimental reliance  or cause  and effect  between the  agency's
   breaching action  and  the  position  of  the  contractor.    The
   contractor bears the burden of  proof in the entitlement phase of
   a proceeding,  because absent  detrimental reliance  or harm  the
   quantum phase should not be reached.
 
        Finally,  regarding  the  New   Hampshire  portion  of   the
   contract, no findings  suggest a breach  regarding the award,  or
   any  impropriety  in  the  termination,  such  that  a basis  for
   entitlement is lacking.
 
   Comments on other statements by the majority
 
        The suggestions of  the majority in  the final paragraph  of
   its  discussion  reveal  a misunderstanding  of  my  analysis and
   conclusions.   The solicitation states  that it does  not reflect
   received  commitments of agencies  to utilize the  IDIQ contract.
   That language, with the  resulting incompleteness of information,
   was an element of the underlying competition.  It is too  late to
   argue  a  breach by  the  agency, when  the  contractor knowingly
   competed without information  which it says affected  its ability
   to compete.  Thus,  while I agree that it is wrong  for an agency
   to mislead  an offeror in  pricing its proposal (whether  IDIQ or
   otherwise), I find that  the language of the solicitation  should
   not have misled  the contractor, that the facts do  not reveal an
   intentional or deliberate attempt to mislead,  and that the facts
   do  not reveal  a level  of reliance  supporting a  conclusion of
   entitlement.    Moreover,  nothing in  the  record  suggests that
   losses  were  a   certainty,  or  that  the  agency  should  have
   anticipated  contractor  losses,  particularly  given  the   IDIQ
   contractual vehicle.
 
        What is missing from the hypothetical raised by the majority
   is a critical element of  the solicitation to parallel that here.
   That is, in  obtaining a contract for beer sales, the team states
   that it is not prepared to state a commitment to remain or not in
   the stadium for  the year of the  contract.  If the  beer vendors
   are  willing to  compete notwithstanding  the absence  of  such a
   commitment, I would find an after-award allegation of entitlement
   to relief for breach for not revealing a change of stadiums to be
   unsupportable.  Further, the attendance at the new stadium may be
   the same (or  greater) than that at the larger  stadium, and beer
   sales  may actually  be greater;  unlike the  majority, I  do not
   assume material facts in favor of a party which has the burden of
   proof in the entitlement phase of this proceeding.
