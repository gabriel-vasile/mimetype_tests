Propane Stocks Return to Normal 
<BR></UL><UL>
<LI>With production being relatively flat, and demand being highly seasonal, propane stocks play an important role over the winter months.  
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
<LI>Propane stocks satisfy about 20 percent of demand during the peak months of December, January and February.  As a result, prices are sensitive to winter stock levels.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
<LI> Last year, stocks were depleted over the cold winter of 1995/96 and ended September 1996 at their third lowest level for start of the winter heating season.  Hopes of a late fall build were dashed with cold weather and late crop-drying needs that boosted demand in the Midwest in October.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
<LI> Fortunately, warm weather throughout the country during the peak winter months helped ease stock pressures.    
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
<LI>Weak demand and strong production over the first 7 months of 1997 have brought stocks back above average.  
<UL>
<LI>The net result is that stocks ended August at 57.3 million barrels, about 2 percent over the five year average, and 8 million barrels above August 1996.  
<LI> Canadian stocks are also high this year, boding well for import potential.
<BR>
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI>Healthy stock levels in both the U.S. and Canada, along with continued high production, should easily accommodate increased demand with seasonal price increases, given stable crude prices.</UL> </P>
