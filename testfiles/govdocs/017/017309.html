        disadvantaged. Recent evidence seems to show that rather than narrowing 
        with new advances in technology, this digital divide is actually widening. 
        There were one billion children born in the last decade of the 20th century, 
        and 95% of them were in developing countries with primitive living conditions&#151;in 
        fact, more than one-half of the 1.2 billion children aged six to 11 have 
        never placed a phone call! <br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">Along with this technological 
        gap has come a severe gap in wealth between segments of society, even 
        in the U.S. The top 20% of households, with incomes of $180,000 a year 
        or more, command 80% of the collected wealth in the United States and 
        49% of the total income earned, and this figure has grown by one-fifth 
        in the past decade, compared with only a 1% growth rate for all households 
        combined. As the world&#146;s leading economy, the United States also 
        leads in widening this internal gap. One out of four children under the 
        age of six now live in poverty, making our child poverty rate the highest 
        in the developed world.<br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">If left to run its course, 
        this gap in knowledge and wealth is expected to polarize nations and create 
        dangers on the world stage, and polarize groups and cultures within our 
        own country, boding ill for cross-cultural relations.<br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">Already, members of this 
        new generation seem to be exhibiting a different set of values than their 
        predecessors. They know more and can access more knowledge than any previous 
        birth cohort, care deeply about some social issues, and have strong beliefs 
        about privacy and rights to information. They are optimistic, but free-thinking 
        and alienated from the formal political structure. <br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">Because of the way they have 
        been taught in school and their use of computers, they do well collaborating 
        with others in small, cross-functional work groups, but tend to disdain 
        close supervision and micro-management. </span><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
      <td width="218" valign="top"><!-- #BeginEditable "mainbodyRight" --><span class="mainbody">They 
        are innovators, and want things to move fast, having little patience for 
        bureaucratic routines or deferred gratification. Because there has been 
        little distinction in their lives between working, learning, and playing 
        (they have done it all in cyberspace), they are hard workers but often 
        prefer to be entrepreneurs or to work from their homes and telecommute. 
        <br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">If the U.S. economy continues 
        to boom for knowledge workers, people who hire them should be prepared 
        for the fact that they may have little attachment to a single employer 
        or career, because so many opportunities are open to them. Employers may 
        have to be prepared to make a number of concessions if they are to retain 
        the &#147;best and the brightest&#148; on their payrolls. It may not be 
        feasible to supervise them in the previously accepted sense. They are 
        accustomed to working in non-hierarchical ways. <br>

        <img src="spacer.gif"> Transportation safety problems 
        at the beginning of the 21st century are still numerous and raise some 
        concerns about the safety of vehicles and the qualifications of drivers, 
        despite much progress in recent years. <br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">According to the U.S. Department 
        of Transportation, breathtaking changes in transportation have brought 
        about the globalization of the economy, changed the way the world does 
        business with just-in-time delivery, opened economic development to previously 
        remote parts of the United States, helped revitalize American cities, 
        and become one of the engines for unprecedented economic expansion.<br>
        <img src="spacer.gif">Transportation today represents 
        10% of the total U.S. economy. Twice as many passengers fly today as 25
