      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The appearance of acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has brought suffering and death to those who
      are afflicted and, at the same time, has posed daunting challenges to
      those who care for the sufferers, to biomedical scientists, and to those
      responsible for public health and public policy. Among these challenges is
      the protection of the nation's blood supply from contamination by human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV),<a href="#CDC57FN5">[1] </a>the causative
      agent of AIDS. This challenge was met rapidly by the development of
      laboratory tests to detect the presence of antibody against the virus. The
      application of these tests makes it possible to determine whether the
      person has been infected by the virus at some time and thus to exclude
      persons from donating blood or to discard blood already donated. In the
      past 15 months, the widespread application of these tests along with
      self-deferral and removal of HIV-positive subjects from the pool of donors
      has sharply reduced the likelihood of the virus being spread by way of
      blood products.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="3"><FN>
      <br>
      <a name="CDC57FN5">[1] Previously referred to as HTLV-III/LAV, and
      subsequently referred to in this document as HIV in accordance with
      emerging and recommended usage.</a><br>
      </FN>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Remarkable progress has recently been made
      in isolating the virus and in developing reasonably reliable tests for
      detecting its presence in blood by measuring the formation of antibodies
      against it. Mobilization of the whole scientific community, from
      government agencies and industry to the individual investigator, has
      brought about this progress, boding well for the eventual prevention of
      the disease. In fact, the prevention of posttransfusion AIDS is a typical
      example of the gains to be achieved by many years of supporting basic
      research.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, the introduction of these tests
      has brought with it some problems. Questions can be raised about
      interpretation of the tests and their extension to purposes other than
      protection of the blood supply. As with almost every aspect of AIDS, the
      facts, opinions, and uncertainties of science are rapidly translated into
      public beliefs and social policy. Often, this translation has been
      inaccurate and incorrect. Policy has been made, or recommended, on the
      basis of an assumed scientific certitude that in fact may not exist.
      Conversely, scientifically sound information has been ignored or distorted
      by policymakers. Scientists have often failed to communicate their
      findings in ways that are useful for public policy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The tests for evidence of infected blood
      are not yet optimally effective. There is still room for improved
      applications of the scientific method to identify methods with increased
      sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. Because no test can be
      totally devoid of error, there must be continuing vigorous efforts to
      educate the public about who is a suitable donor of blood and to
      facilitate anonymous self-deferral at the time of blood donation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To enhance understanding among scientists,
      those responsible for the health of individuals and of society, and the
      public at large, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the NIH Office of Medical
      Applications of Research sponsored this<br>
      Consensus Development Conference on the Impact of Routine HIV-Antibody
      Testing of Blood and Plasma Donors on Public Health. Other sponsors of the
      conference were the Centers for Disease Control; the Food and Drug
      Administration; the Clinical Center, NIH; the National Institute of
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH; and the National Institute of Mental
      Health.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The conference brought together biomedical
      investigators, blood bank specialists, clinicians, consumers, and
      representatives of public interest groups. Following 2 days of
      presentations by medical experts and discussion by the audience, the
      consensus panel worked hard to interpret the scientific evidence. Comments
      and recommendations are organized according to the following questions:</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What tests are currently being used?
          What are their performance characteristics?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What constitutes a positive test? How
          should a positive HIV-antibody test result be interpreted? How should
          these tests be used?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">How should positive test results be
          handled?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What are the psychosocial ramifications
          for blood donors of knowledge of a positive test result?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What impact has testing had on
          transfusion medicine?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What research directions should be
          pursued?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial" size="3"><SEC>
      </font>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Tests Are Currently Being Used? What
      Are Their Performance Characteristics?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are three approaches to detecting HIV
      infection. Listed in decreasing order of difficulty and expense, they are:</font>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Detection of the virus by culturing it.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Detection of antigens elaborated by the
          virus and present in blood.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Detection of HIV-specific antibodies
          that are produced by the infected person's immune system.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Two tests mainly support the entire current
      testing program. Both are of the third type. ELISA (enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay) reacts to the presence of antibodies in the donor's
      blood, showing a more intense color as larger quantities of the antibodies
      are present in the serum. A positive reaction is recorded where the
      observed intensity exceeds a cutoff value set by the manufacturer of the
      test kit. If the cutoff value is set low, so that relatively faint
      specimens are recorded as positive, the chance of detecting HIV cases with
      low levels of antibody are increased. At the same time, such a low
      threshold increases the chance of recording as positive samples that do
      not contain antibodies against HIV which can also produce color in the
      system. To protect the blood supply, it is prudent for a given test to set
      the threshold low, and accept the increase in false positives that must
      accompany that low threshold.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With a low threshold the ELISA test is
      quite sensitive; that is, truly infected persons are highly likely to give
      a positive reaction. But, uninfected persons--who are vastly more
      numerous--also occasionally give positive reactions to this test. This
      small fraction of uninfected donors produces many more of the positive
      reactions than arise from positive reactions of the few persons actually
      HIV-infected. That is, the odds are great that any single ELISA-positive
      reading comes from an uninfected person. Furthermore, low positive values
      are often not reproducible; that is, a repeated, independent sample from a
      donor whose first test was barely positive will likely turn up negative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Current practice is that all donors are
      ELISA-tested. If the test is negative the unit of blood is acceptable. If
      there is a positive reaction, two further ELISA tests are performed on the
      same unit. If both are negative, the unit is acceptable. If either is
      positive, the unit is classified as &quot;repeatably reactive&quot; and is
      destroyed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the nonprofit blood banking system,
      there is further testing of the blood of a repeat reactor, aimed at
      clarifying the person's HIV status, which is still ambiguous since so many
      HIV false positives occur among the ELISA repeat reactors. The Western
      blot test is then applied. It, too, is an antibody detecting test, but it
      differs from the ELISA in several ways:</font>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">It gives information about particular
          antibodies among the several that HIV antigens may elicit; prominent
          among these are antibodies against p24 and gp41.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">It uses electrophoresis and is thus more
          expensive and demanding of expertise than the ELISA.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">It is less likely to give a false
          positive or false negative result.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If the specimen is Western-blot-positive,
      the donor is regarded as infected with HIV and notification of the donor
      is attempted. If the repeat reactor's Western blot test is negative, the
      donor may be informed that:</font>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The blood is not, and will not be,
          usable.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The donor in all probability is not
          infected.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To protect the quality of the blood supply,
      it is essential to reduce the number of false negatives to a minimum.
      However, false negatives cannot be totally eliminated because some sera
      contain too little anti-HIV antibody to be detected; they come primarily
      from donors who have been infected very recently, typically during the
      first 6 weeks of infection, or from individuals who for one reason or
      another form antibody very slowly. It is essential to increase the
      sensitivity of methods for detecting anti-HIV antibody and to develop
      methods to detect and measure HIV antigens or infected T<sub>4</sub>
      cells.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Several versions of the ELISA test are on
      the market. They differ in their comparative sensitivity to the various
      antigens of HIV, and thus reflect somewhat different information about the
      antibodies in a given blood sample. They also presumably differ in
      sensitivity to sample constituents responsible for false positives. The
      cost-benefit ratio of simultaneously using ELISA tests from two different
      manufacturers on each sample to improve accuracy should be explored.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Several other methods of detecting anti-HIV
      antibodies are very useful for confirming and extending results obtained
      by the ELISA method, but are more time-consuming. Western blotting is
      difficult to standardize, but staining of p24 together with gp41 is
      unequivocally positive. Correlation with intermediate and high ELISA
      values is excellent. Radioimmune precipitation (RIP) and radioimmune assay
      (RIA) can be made both sensitive and specific by using very highly labeled
      antigens, but require skilled personnel and involve the use of
      radioactivity. HIV isolation is very difficult, time-consuming, and
      requires highly skilled personnel; it does not lend itself to analysis of
      large numbers of samples. It correlates highly with high ELISA values.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The most promising new approaches will be
      the development of fluorescent antibody (FA) techniques for detecting
      infected T<sub>4</sub> lymphocytes and the development of techniques for
      detecting viral proteins, based either on antigen capture or on reverse
      transcriptase (RT) activation and synthesis of HIV DNA, which can then be
      detected with high sensitivity and specificity. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Constitutes a Positive Test? How
      Should a Positive HIV-Antibody Test Result Be Interpreted? How Should
      These Tests Be Used?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The virus thought to cause AIDS has been
      isolated and its genome and gene products are largely characterized. Tests
      have been developed for the detection of virus, virus-coded proteins, and
      antibodies directed against those proteins. These developments have
      facilitated large-scale screening of blood and blood products for viral
      antibodies. Clearly, the tests in use have enhanced the safety of
      transfusion procedures.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Current procedures utilize an ELISA test
      for detecting antibodies against HIV as an initial screen. An additional
      test, the Western blot, is used to test sera found repeatably reactive in
      the ELISA test. Extensive experience has demonstrated that many sera that
      are repeatably reactive in the ELISA test do not react when tested by
      Western blot analysis. These discordant results indicate that many of the
      sera that are repeatably reactive in the ELISA test do not represent
      combinations with virus-specific proteins and often may not indicate the
      presence of an HIV infection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Resolution of this problem is difficult
      because of limitations in currently available information. This is partly
      because investigators often use different methodologies, and licensed
      tests from different manufacturers probably differ in subtle yet possibly
      important ways. There are few published comparative analyses of the tests
      used in the field. Further, Western blots have generally been carried out
      by personnel who are aware of the fact that the sera they are testing have
      reacted in the ELISA test. In addition, it often is not possible to
      estimate the specificity of these tests because ELISA-negative sera are
      not being routinely tested by Western blot. Consequently, there is still a
      need for rigorous studies to clarify many issues regarding interpretation
      of test results.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The most specific test for infectivity
      remains virus isolation; however, because of the complexity and difficulty
      of isolating HIV in cell culture, this is an impractical method for
      large-scale use. Some form of the ELISA test with enhanced sensitivity and
      specificity remains the most practical and feasible procedure for
      large-scale screening of the blood supply. Improved confirmatory methods
      should be developed that can be used in conjunction with such a test. Even
      with currently available tests, however, it is essential that confirmatory
      studies be performed without the laboratory personnel knowing the prior
      ELISA results. Specimens should be identified by a code number only and a
      suitable number of ELISA-negative specimens should be included in each
      test run.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For the purposes of notifying the donor, a
      confirmatory test such as the Western blot should be applied to resolve
      the actual HIV status because the repeated reaction may be caused by
      factors such as autoimmune or cell-line-specific antibodies. Currently,
      however, blood banks are obliged to exclude sera that test repeatably
      reactive in the ELISA regardless of any confirmatory test results. Many of
      these almost certainly represent false positive reactions. It is
      unfortunate that a considerable number of donors are functionally excluded
      from donation because of their questionable test status. Efforts should
      therefore be made to find ways to identify ELISA-positive individuals who
      are not infected so that their true serological status may be defined and
      their return to the blood donor pool expedited.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Available data indicate that the presence
      of virus precursors or antibodies in the blood reflects the continuing
      presence of HIV in the host. Thus, detection of such components represents
      a sign of continued infectivity of the blood. Like many other chronic
      viral infections, the period very shortly after exposure is often likely
      to be characterized by lack of antibody and by levels of virus proteins
      below the threshold of detection. In addition, biologic variation of both
      host and pathogen suggest that some chronically infected individuals do
      not synthesize virus-specific antibodies or make quantities of viral
      proteins that can be detected by assays currently in use. Nevertheless,
      such individuals are potentially infectious. Thus, while total elimination
      of infected blood from the national supply is not immediately feasible, it
      remains a desirable goal. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">How Should Positive Test Results Be
      Handled?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A positive test<a href="#CDC57FN6">[2]</a>
      has the following significance as currently understood:</font>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Such persons are infected with HIV.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Most persons infected with retroviruses
          such as HIV are infected for life.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">All persons who are antibody-positive
          for HIV, whether they are symptom-free or ill, must be considered to
          be potentially infectious to others by sexual transmission, by sharing
          of drug injection equipment, by childbearing, or by donation of blood,
          semen, or organs.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Antibody positivity is not synonymous
          with having AIDS. However, by current estimate, as many as 35 percent
          of HIV-antibody-positive persons may experience progression to AIDS
          over 6 to 8 years.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">We cannot precisely predict who among
          persons with antibody positivity will be ill or fatally ill in the
          future and it is not possible at present to prevent such outcomes.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">All antibody-positive persons should
          seek information and advice on how to protect their sexual contacts
          and future children from infection.</font></li>

      <a name="CDC57FN6">[2] Positive: describes a repeatably reactive sample
      which is determined to contain antibody by an additional, more specific
      test, such as Western blot, radioimmunoprecipitation, and the like.
      Persons who have positive sera are termed &quot;seropositive.&quot;</a><br>
      </FN>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The panel believes that there is a clear
      ethical responsibility on the part of blood- and plasma-collection centers
      to notify individuals with repeatably reactive blood in a sensitive,
      humane, and supportive manner. Consideration should be given to the
      donor's cultural and linguistic background. The need to maintain
      confidentiality of the information creates a duty on the part of
      blood-collection centers to assume primary responsibility for notifying
      positive donors of their test results.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Notification of donors serves two purposes:</font>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">It contributes to controlling the spread
          of HIV by encouraging self-deferral and changes in sexual practices.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">It provides circumstances for optimizing
          the health and well-being of the affected individual.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Differences exist across communities with
      respect to the process by which notification is accomplished, the nature
      of the information provided, and the extent of counseling that is
      provided. The panel does not believe that any single approach would be
      universally applicable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Notification should be followed by
      education. The panel believes that the central component to education is
      person-to-person interchange between the donor and the counselor.
      Additional techniques such as videotape presentations and printed
      materials may supplement, but not substitute for, personal interchange.
      Appropriate elements of a supportive counseling program for persons who
      are seropositive include education about the natural history of HIV
      infection and the meaning of a positive test, advice on behavioral changes
      that will protect one's sexual partner(s) from infection, and referral to
      additional resources.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While blood collection centers will rarely
      have the trained personnel or assets to provide extensive and specialized
      counsel, we believe that they have a duty to cooperate with community
      agencies that can provide the necessary supportive services and to make
      effective referrals. These referrals would include the person's physician
      and other long-term counseling services, and such community agencies as
      local health departments, alternate test sites, AIDS service
      organizations, social service agencies, and others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Confidentiality should be carefully and
      strictly maintained due to the sensitive nature of the information. Test
      results should be released to parties other than the patient only when
      there is a scientifically valid and legitimate need to know for public
      health purposes and, in principle, with the patient's specific consent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Current practice in many centers is to
      enter the names of persons whose blood is repeatably reactive but negative
      by Western blot into lists of deferred donors. We believe that it is
      inappropriate to enter a person's identity into such a list without his
      knowledge and without giving him the personal advantage of sharing that
      knowledge and its meaning. It is common practice to allow such individuals
      to donate again, but to discard their blood without their knowledge. This
      practice should not continue; these donors have a right to be advised of
      their status.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Blood-collection agencies currently
      maintain lists of deferred donors onto which are entered the names of
      HIV-antibody-positive donors. The agencies believe that such lists
      increase the likelihood that infectious units of blood will be screened
      out in the future should positive donors not self-defer. On the other
      hand, such lists are a potential source of loss of confidentiality for
      donors should their identity be inadvertently revealed. We believe that a
      balance of interests supports the entry of the names of those who are
      believed to be truly positive or whose status cannot be satisfactorily
      resolved but only if such donors are informed initially that their name
      will be listed, if the list is very securely held, and the list is used
      only for the limited purpose of protecting the quality of the blood
      supply. The actual utility of such lists should be regularly evaluated as
      technology improves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Persons found to be seropositive may have a
      history of previous blood donations. For such persons, the question then
      arises about their past donations that have already been transfused into
      patients. In these cases, the blood bank has a serious responsibility to
      notify the hospital to which that blood was sent. It is the responsibility
      of the hospital, directly or through the patient's physician, to notify
      the patients of the possibility of having received seropositive blood and
      to educate them about the meaning of this. It is our opinion that, while
      the blood banks do not have the primary responsibility for the
      notification and counseling of recipients, they should, within their
      means, assist hospitals and physicians with accurate and effective
      information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The repeatably reactive donors (by ELISA)
      in the plasmapheresis setting cannot be characterized without additional
      testing as being either positive or negative for anti-HIV antibody. If the
      plasmapheresis industry is unwilling to test these donors further, the
      situation should be explained to the donor and the donor should be
      referred to an agency where such testing and pretest and posttest
      counseling are available. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Are the Psychosocial Ramifications
      for Blood Donors of Knowledge of a Positive Test Result?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Everyone involved in blood and plasma
      collecting is aware of the potential psychosocial ramifications of the
      knowledge of a positive test result. Nevertheless, current data do not
      reveal the magnitude and nature of the short- and long-term psychosocial
      adjustment problems that seropositive donors and their sexual partners and
      family members experience. Possible outcomes include the effects on the
      individual's psychological and physical health, subsequent sexual
      behavior, lack of self-deferral behavior, and functioning in one's work
      and other social roles. Other research concerned with risk factors in
      health and illness has suggested that these outcomes will vary with the
      social and political climate of the community, the sociodemographic
      characteristics of the subpopulations at risk, the individual's
      personality traits, social support system, and characteristic mode of
      coping.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Due to issues of confidentiality, the
      education and initial notification of donors of confirmed reactive and
      positive tests is the responsibility of plasma- and blood-collecting
      institutions and begins prior to blood donation. Anticipation of the
      donor's fear and distress is not a valid basis for not informing the
      donor. The content and manner in which the message is delivered may play a
      role in modifying the stress of being informed subsequent to a positive
      test result. In the notification procedure it is critical to differentiate
      between the ELISA test defined as repeatably reactive, and the individual
      defined as seropositive based on additional confirmatory tests. It is also
      the responsibility of these centers to offer followup support and
      counseling through referral to the health care system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a need for rigorous psychosocial
      research that will provide such data necessary to determine behavioral
      outcomes and to design and evaluate appropriate intervention strategies.
      The literature on the psychosocial outcomes of other life-threatening
      chronic conditions should be useful in this endeavor and will enhance
      research concerned with psychosocial ramifications for blood donors with
      positive tests. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Impact Has Testing Had on Transfusion
      Medicine?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">HIV testing has important implications for
      blood donors, patients, practicing physicians, blood banking operations,
      and manufacturers of blood products and devices.</font></p>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Donors</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The panel unanimously affirms that the
      primary means of preventing AIDS and protecting the public health is
      through the responsible behavior of individuals. Thus, the primary public
      health measure is education regarding what constitutes risky behavior and
      ways in which such behavior might be modified. With regard to safety of
      the blood supply, this responsible behavior consists of persons who are
      likely to be infected refraining from blood donation. This behavior must
      be encouraged in every reasonable way. It is our belief that punitive and
      threatening measures against groups that are at increased risk are
      counterproductive; they drive individuals away from responsible behavior
      and make education almost impossible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Voluntary blood donors have the right to
      expect confidentiality of records of blood donation and anonymity with
      respect to the recipient of their blood. They should receive an
      explanation of tests to be performed, consequences of a positive test, and
      details of any lists on which their name may be entered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Two widespread misconceptions regarding HIV
      infection exist among potential donors. The idea that blood donation
      places a donor at risk for AIDS is patently false. It is also incorrect
      that all infected donors will be detected by screening tests.
      Informational programs to dispel these ideas are needed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Because of real or perceived social
      pressures, some persons at risk to transmit HIV may feel compelled to
      donate blood. Procedures should be adopted by all blood banks to allow
      donors to indicate confidentially that their blood should not be
      transfused (self-deferral). Persons at risk for AIDS should be advised
      through programs of public education not to donate blood.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Alternative test sites should be available
      to allow anonymous access to testing without the need for voluntary blood
      donation.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Practicing Physicians</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Blood utilization in the United States has
      declined significantly since 1982, the first such change in more than
      three decades. Much of this reduction appears to be the result of more
      judicious use of blood transfusion therapy by physicians. Preoperative
      autologous blood donation and intraoperative blood salvage have increased
      significantly and should be encouraged. These developments have reduced
      patient exposure to homologous blood and reflect good transfusion
      practice. Efforts should be made to increase the knowledge of practicing
      physicians about transfusion medicine and to make consultation readily
      available to them. Recipients should be adequately informed about the
      risks of blood transfusion. Effective peer review of transfusion practices
      should be maintained, and recording of the indications for blood
      transfusion in patient charts should be encouraged. All possible steps
      should be taken to avoid unnecessary blood transfusion. This is especially
      critical for neonates, who may be uniquely susceptible to HIV infection.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Blood Banks</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is uniform agreement that autologous
      blood is the safest form of transfusion therapy. Blood banks and blood
      centers should make this option available to all qualified healthy people
      with a scheduled elective operation, simplify the donation process to the
      extent possible, and inform physicians and patients about the advantages
      and mechanics of this approach. However, stockpiling of autologous blood
      without an imminent need should not be countenanced. In some areas, blood
      banks and blood centers have acceded to requests by individual patients
      for &quot;directed donations,&quot; that is, donations by persons known to
      the prospective recipients. Although no evidence was presented to show
      that directed donations are any more or any less safe than donations from
      the general public for individual patients, the panel heard persuasive
      arguments against directed donations based on social and ethical
      considerations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Transfusion medicine is emerging as a
      sophisticated individual discipline. Additional physicians well-trained in
      this specialty are needed to meet educational needs, assure appropriate
      transfusion practices, and encourage research and training programs.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Impact on Manufacturers of Blood Products
      and Devices</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The plasma fractionation industry uses
      large pools of plasma for the preparation of certain lots of clotting
      factor concentrates. Despite highly sensitive tests for anti-HIV antibody
      used to screen individual units of plasma, final products may contain
      infected units not detected by these assays. Reasonably successful methods
      have been developed to inactivate virus in these products. Recent reports
      of HIV seroconversion in previously seronegative hemophiliacs receiving
      heat-treated factor VIII concentrates suggest the need to develop better
      procedures for removal or inactivation of virus. Production of certain
      clotting factors by recombinant DNA techniques and by monoclonal antibody
      methods is now in progress and should be encouraged.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Devices have been developed to salvage
      patients' blood during operations, following trauma, and in other selected
      conditions. Recognizing the advantages of autologous blood, the panel
      recommends that industry continue to improve blood salvage devices. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Research Directions Should Be
      Pursued?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is remarkable that in the few years
      since AIDS was recognized, the human immunodeficiency virus has been
      characterized and tests for specific antibody have been developed and
      implemented for the protection of blood donors and transfusion recipients.
      However, the ELISA screening tests in current use fail to detect some
      infectious donors and yield positive reactions with many donors who are
      HIV-negative. It is essential that more sensitive tests be developed to
      detect low levels of antibody. Highly specific confirmatory tests capable
      of distinguishing false positive from true positive reactions and that can
      be performed in a blood center are also required. In the early stage of
      HIV infection, virus may be present without antibody. In rare individuals
      with infection of longer duration, antibody levels may be too low to be
      detected with any test. Highly specific methods for detecting HIV in donor
      blood are available, but these are time-consuming, expensive, and lacking
      in sensitivity. Since direct detection of virus offers the most specific
      way of identifying donors who carry HIV, emphasis should be placed on the
      development of improved methods for detecting the HIV genome and
      virus-specific proteins in blood samples.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">No definitive measures are yet available to
      predict which persons infected with HIV will develop AIDS, and much
      remains to be learned about modes of infection and the best ways of
      preventing the spread of HIV to personal contacts. Longitudinal studies of
      seropositive persons are needed to define outcomes in these individuals.
      Even in the absence of a cure for AIDS, better information on these issues
      would be invaluable to blood transfusion recipients and those carrying
      HIV.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">AIDS presents enormous challenges for
      psychosocial research. Persons in high-risk groups must be informed about
      the danger of transmitting HIV by transfusion and persuaded to comply with
      blood donor regulations. Effective methods of counsel and support for
      HIV-positive persons should be characterized and implemented. Considering
      that the next great threat from AIDS may come from heterosexual spread,
      means should be found to educate young, sexually active persons about the
      hazard of AIDS and the changes in behavior required to reduce the risk of
      contracting or transmitting this disease.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Since no methods of donor screening are
      likely to eliminate all risk of HIV transmission by blood, better methods
      of inactivating or removing HIV from blood products, especially those
      produced from plasma pooled from many donors, should be sought. Production
      of such products by recombinant DNA methods eventually should eliminate
      the risk of transmitting HIV and other infections with them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, and most obviously, the extensive
      efforts now under way to develop effective therapeutic agents for AIDS and
      methods for immunization against HIV should be sustained until these goals
      are achieved. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Conclusions</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Remarkable progress has been made in
      applying the fruits of basic research to the development and detection of
      antibodies against HIV in blood collected for transfusion. Although test
      sensitivity is constantly improving, there is never a perfect test and
      exclusion of possibly infected donors remains important. A procedure
      should be adopted by all blood banks to allow donors to indicate
      confidentially that their blood should not be transfused (self-deferral).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As a result of the policy of minimizing the
      chances of positive blood slipping through the screen, false positive
      tests will always occur. Extra efforts will be required to reassure donors
      and to salvage blood now discarded because of a false positive reaction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Confirmed positive tests mean that the
      donor is infected and has an unknown but real chance of developing AIDS.
      Disease will continue to be recognized in those who received infected
      blood before universal testing began and in the rare instance of
      transfusion of a blood product that for whatever reason falsely tested
      negative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A policy of protection of the individual
      donor's privacy should be vigorously pursued; however, blood banks must be
      responsible for properly informing the individual and arranging for
      counseling. Much needs to be learned about the short- and long-term
      psychosocial adjustment problems of healthy people who are told they have
      an infection that may prove life-threatening.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Every aspect of the problem requires
      continuing research. More sensitive tests that more specifically identify
      infectivity must be developed and tested in epidemiologically sound ways.
      Better methods of discouraging possibly infected donors and handling the
      psychological problems occurring in those with positive tests must be
      discovered through sound research projects. &nbsp;</font></p>
