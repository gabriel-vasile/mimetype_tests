</font></b><br>        </p>        <ol>          <li><strong>How will you translate your experiences in              the Mojave to your students?</strong><br>            <br>            Obviously, I don't have students, yet...I'm            still a student myself. However, my target teaching audience will            be at a level where NASA really hasn't been concentrating much. Pretty            much all of the educational outreach programs are targeted at the            K-12 levels. My audience will probably be at least the junior or            community college level, and hopefully at the undergraduate or graduate            level.<br>            <br>            At the 13+ educational level, the challenges become less of            getting your students to &quot;buy into the dream&quot; and more            of keeping them focused on a career where they will be truly at the            forefront of their field. When they start looking at US Government  <a href="http://www.opm.gov/oca/07tables/html/sf.asp" target="_blank">general            pay scales</a>, the incentive to work for NASA evaporates pretty            quickly.<br>            <br>            Realistically, the salary factor (or lack thereof) comes            into play for pretty much any pure science or research field. The            challenge of a teacher at the college level is in guiding their students            into fields where they will be happiest. The almighty Dollar goes            a long way toward satisfaction it that respect, but leads to a lot            of people questioning their career choice ten or so years down the            road (ahem...).<br>            <br>            When we start putting people in Lunar and Martian            research colonies, we're going to want our best and brightest. The            additional incentive of simply making students aware of the incredible            opportunities, as well as the pure diversity and variety of the experiences            available to a pure research scientist, just might be enough to swing            some of those brilliant lights NASA's way.<br>            <br>            &quot;Yeah, you're only making $90k with a PhD and 5 years of experience,            but duuuuuuuude...you're working on MARS!&quot; ;)<br>            <br>          </li>          <li> <strong>Describe your personal changes in your outlook on science,            teaching, and science research?<br>            </strong><br>            Realistically, my outlook on any of the three didn't change much.              I entered the Spaceward Bound expedition with a very good idea          of what to expect, and wasn't disappointed.<br>          <br>          If anything, I was able            to experience a much wider variety of sciences than I anticipated.            There was very little pure theoretical- and astro-physics (my personal            field) research, and much more chemestry, biology and geology. I            know that if I am going to pursue a career in astrobiology, I will            need to be well versed in more than just pure physics. If I found            out that I wasn't comfortable with the extended fields of study,            then perhaps I would need to re-assess my current scholastic goals.            Luckily, I greatly enjoyed every one of the research projects I participated            in, boding well for my future pursuits.<br>            <br>          </li>          <li><strong>What was most effective about how the Expedition              went?<br>              <br>          </strong>There were a couple of aspects which really stood              out as being well run, or as having the most potential. First,              the general structure of the program, the scheduling, facilities              and logistics were exceptional. We (the &quot;teachers&quot;) had              every opportunity to get up to our necks in field research during              the day, and have the time to discuss what we did with our groups              after dinner. Yes, we didn't get much sleep, but it was a worthwhile              sacrifice!<br>              <br>              My small group, led by Geoff Hammond, was a critical              part of the program. Having the previous years' teachers as our              experienced group leaders, kept us focused on the real reason we              were in the Mojave, to relay our experiences on to our students.              With all the work we were doing during the day, it would have been              easy to become too immersed in the science and lose focus. Geoff              set the example, telling us about how he was able to translate              his experiences in the Atacama into lessons for his students, and              helping us to find ways to pass on our Mojave experiences to our              own students.<br>              <br>            Finally, the science was outstanding. If the individual            showed interest, the researchers and scientists didn't pull any            punches when we joined their groups for the day. We had the option            to go out and do real research, not pre-made &quot;toy&quot; projects,            and get real results. If we showed interest, and the slightest bit            of competence, the research leads treated us as intellectual peers,            and gave us the opportunity to experience field work as it was meant            to be.<br>            <br>          </li>          <li><strong>What could be done differently with Spaceward Bound? What            other experiences could be offered?<br>            <br>          </strong><em>MORE</em> science less &quot;fluff&quot;!<br>          <br>          The highlight of the program          is, after all, the scientific experience. The teachers being brought          in all have college degrees, most with a minimum of science curriculum,          and should be treated as full-fledged research assistants. Put us/them          to work! It doesn't even have to be all field work, either. Data analysis,          lab work, even some print research, finding similar published works,          are all parts of the scientific process, and should be part of Spaceward          Bound.<br>          <br>          I felt that much of the &quot;fluff&quot; such as the basic biology,            chemistry and geology should have been moved to the webcasts, or maybe            passed on by bringing the teachers in for a couple of days of &quot;prep&quot; work          at Ames before we headed out to the site.<br>          <br>          Once we got on site, we should            have been able to jump right into the work being done by the scientists          there.<br>          <br>          Sure, the tours and &quot;fun&quot; activities were entertaining,            but if those types of activities are going to be included, they should            also have a strong science element as well. The baloon rides were            great (I would guess -- I never went), but how about letting the            teachers get in on the data analysis -after- the baloon lands. Did          anyone actually see the IR pictures that were taken?<br>          <br>          The rover was a          fun toy, but how will mechanical and communication breakdowns, like          the ones we had in the Mojave be handled on Mars? What about the off-the          shelf components we were using? How will they be modified for extra-terrestrial          use? etc...<br>          <br>          </li>          <li><strong>Were the pre-expedition broadcasts helpful?&nbsp; Suggestions            for improvements?<br>            <br>          </strong>Sort of. The first couple were very informative.            They had the solid science I was referring to above. Although, I            would have liked to have seen more reading assignments, possibly            even some more of the published papers. The homework was lightweight,            and didn't really force us to really learn about the topics. Even            if we opted to go into depth on the chosen material, particularly            the &quot;science themes&quot; homework,            the connection was never made between the research we did for the            broadcasts, and the work that was planned for the field.<br>            <br>            I also have            a technical complaint. The resolution of the broadcast was low enough            that reading the slides was impossible. Sure, I ended up downloading            the Powerpoint presentations and following along that way, but it            was inconvenient.<br>            <br>            There were also frequent sound issues, drop outs,            extraneous noises, and occasional cross-talk with busy signals and            phone lines.<br>            <br>            Similarly, I would have liked to have seen the chat room            be a real chat room. I would have liked to have seen my fellow participants            there, and maybe had some discussions between us, instead of having            it set up as an e-mail service to the moderator.<br>            <br>          </li>          <li><strong>What did you get out of the personal interaction            with scientists and other teachers?&nbsp; How will it affect your            teaching?<br>            <br>          </strong>Ok, I'll admit it. I'm a science geek. I actually found listening              to the late-night discussion between Drs McKay, Nienow and Boston            about the potential of using mathematical simulations to model the            geometric formation of plant growths to be one of the highlights            of my trip. It was complex math combined with computer modeling combined            with biology -- HELLO!? -- How cool is that?<br>            <br>            Yeah, yeah...I know.          It takes a certain mindset to embrace your inner geek. The scientists          there had it down. The teachers had a different agenda. They were there          for their students. While many of them shared the enthusiasm for the          science, their first priority was to get this cutting-edge science          back to their students.<br>          <br>          I can't recall how many times I heard one of            the teachers say &quot;My            students would love this!&quot; or &quot;How can I do this experiment          with my kids back home?&quot;<br>          <br>          </li>          <li><strong>How can NASA support the next group of teachers            and the Spaceward Bound program?<br>            <br>          </strong>I think I covered the major part of my suggestions for the          science part of the program in my answers to #s 3 and 4 above.<br>          <br>          As for          the logistic support, we had it easy...Catered meals, hot showers,          indoor accomodations, there wasn't much more we could ask for. I drove          down from San Jose, so my transportation needs were minimal. However,          it seemed that the airport transfer process was reasonably well organized.<br>          <br>          </li>          <li><strong>Estimate the number of people who watched the webcast?            (school, family, etc.) Provide a breakdown of who watched?<br>            <br>          </strong>I have no idea. I didn't expect to be a part of the broadcast,            as I don't have any students, so outside of a pointer to the Spaceward              Bound! page, i didn't really spread the word.<br>              <br>          </li>          <li><strong>If you are a part of an NES school or NEAT program, how            did this affiliation affect your experience on the expedition?<br>            <br>          </strong>N/A<br>          <br>          </li>          <li><strong>What do you see Spaceward Bound evolving into in the            next 5 years?&nbsp; What would it look like?<br>            <br>          </strong>I have no idea...seriously. So much depends on funding.<br>          <br>          Spaceward          Bound seems like a very low budget program, which is both good and          bad. Good in that measuring it by the impact per dollar spent, probably          makes it one of the most effective programs in NASA's budget. Bad,          in that with such a small budget, the potential for a measurable impact          is small. While 40 teachers seemed like a lot when were were down in          the Mojave, out of the tens of thousands in the US, it's such a small          number.<br>          <br>          The evolution of the program should be driven by the needs of          the scientists. In order for the research programs to remain relevant,              and the teachers to bring back real experiences, the expedition            needs to ldetermine the best locations, facilities and timeframes            to support the scientific study, and only once a research skeleton            is arranged, should the educational part of the program be fleshed          out.</li>        </ol>                <p>&nbsp;        </p>        <p></p>        <p align="center"><br>        </p>        <p></p>	  </td>      <td width="23" valign="top" background="../../images/rightSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="23" height="1" border="0"></td>    </tr>  </table>    <table width="773" height="5" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table for layout">    <tr>      <td width="20" height="5" background="../../images/leftSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="20" height="1" border="0"></td>      <td width="730" height="5" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="1" height="5" border="0"></td>      <td width="23" height="5" background="../../images/rightSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="23" height="1" border="0"></td>    </tr>  </table>  <table width="773" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="table for layout">    <tr>      <td width="20" valign="top" background="../../images/leftSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="20" height="1" border="0"></td>      <td width="156" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><a href="#"><img src="../../images/firstgov.gif" alt="FirstGov" width="156" height="50" border="0"></a></td>      <td width="285" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" class="footer"><br>        <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oig/hq/hotline.html" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ Inspector General Hotline</a><br>        <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codee/nofear.html" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ Equal Employment Opportunity Data posted pursuant to the No Fear Act</a><br>        <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ Budgets, Strategic Plans and Accountability Reports</a><br>        <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/FOIA/agency/" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ Freedom of Information Act</a><br>        <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/HP_Management.html" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ The President's Management Agenda</a><br>        <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/HP_Privacy.html" target="_blank" class="footerLnk">+ NASA Privacy Statement, Disclaimer, and Accessibility Certification</a></td>      <td width="24" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="24" height="1" border="0"></td>      <td width="60" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><img src="../../images/meatball_sm.gif" alt="NASA" width="60" height="50" border="0"></td>      <td width="193" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" class="light"><p><br>          Editor: Linda Conrad <br>          NASA Official: Liza Coe<br>          Last Updated:February 2006<br>          Students Contact: Loretta Hidalgo<br>          &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:loretta@spacegen.org">(loretta@spacegen.org</a>)<br>          Teachers Contact: Liza Coe<br>          &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:Lizabeth.K.Coe@nasa.gov">Lizabeth.K.Coe@nasa.gov</a>)</p>      </td>      <td width="12" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="12" height="1" border="0"></td>      <td width="23" valign="top" background="../../images/rightSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="23" height="1" border="0"></td>    </tr>  </table>  <table width="773" height="5" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table for layout">    <tr>      <td width="20" height="5" background="../../images/leftSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="20" height="1" border="0"></td>      <td width="730" height="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="1" height="5" border="0"></td>      <td width="23" height="5" background="../../images/rightSide.gif"><img src="../../images/shim.gif" alt=" " width="23" height="1" border="0"></td>    </tr>  </table>  <table width="773" height="24" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table for layout">    <tr>      <td width="773" height="24"><img src="../../images/bottom.gif" alt=" " width="773" height="24" border="0"></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
