Well-resolved PES spectra have been obtained at two detachment photon energies, 266 nm (4.661 eV) and 193 nm (6.424 eV).  Basin-hopping global optimization method in combination with density-functional theory calculations has been used for the structural searches.  Good agreement between the measured PES spectra and theoretical simulations helps to identify the global minimum structures.  It is found that LiAl12&oline; (C5v) can be viewed as replacing a surface Al atom by Li on an icosahedral Al13&oline;, whereas Cu prefers the central site to form the encapsulated D3d-Cu@Al12&oline;.  For AuAl12&oline; (C1), Au also prefers the central site, but severely distorts the Al12 cage due to its large size.  </span>

               <span class="abstract">Although boron clusters were experimentally studied shortly after the discovery of the fullerenes, their structural characterization was only possible fairly recently when we combined photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and theoretical calculations to investigate the structures and bonding of boron clusters. Early theoretical studies indicated that small boron clusters do not assume cage-like structures, which are common in bulk boron and compounds; instead, planar or quasi-planar structures were suggested. The combined PES and theoretical studies show indeed boron clusters with up to 15 atom are planar, and only at B20 does a three-dimensional (3D) structure (double ring) become energetically competitive, whereas B20- still remains planar. A recent ion mobility and theoretical study showed that for Bn + the doublering 3D structure becomes competitive at B16 +7.</span>

               <span class="abstract">The electronic structure and chemical bonding in the Ta3&minus; cluster are investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Photoelectron spectra are obtained for Ta3&minus; at four photon energies: 532, 355, 266 and 193 nm. While congested spectra are observed at high electron binding energies, several low-lying electronic transitions are well resolved and compared with the theoretical calculations. The electron affinity of Ta3 is determined to be 1.35&plusmn;0.03 eV. Extensive density functional calculations are performed at the B3LYP/Stuttgart +2f1g level to locate the ground state and low-lying isomers for Ta3 and Ta3 &minus;.  The ground state for the Ta3 &minus; anion is shown to be a quintet (5A1&prime;) with D3h symmetry, whereas two nearly isoenergetic states, C2v (4A1) and D3h (6A1&prime;), are found to compete for the ground state for neutral Ta3. A detailed molecular orbital analysis is performed to elucidate the chemical boding in Ta3&minus;, which is found to possess multiple d-orbital aromaticity, commensurate with its highly symmetric D3h structure.</span>

               <span class="abstract">The interactions of CO with gold clusters are essential to understanding the catalytic mechanisms of CO oxidation on supported gold nanoparticles. Here we report a photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical study of CO adsorption on a well-defined Au6&minus; cluster in Au6(CO)n&minus; (n = 4-9). Previous studies have shown that the first three CO successively bind the three apex sites of the triangular Au6&minus;. The current work reveals that the forth CO induces a major structural change to create more apex sites to accommodate the additional CO. Definitive spectroscopic evidence is obtained for the chemisorption saturation at Au6(CO)6 &minus;, in which Au6 has rearranged to accommodate the six CO adsorbates. The photoelectron spectra of larger clusters from Au6(CO)7 &minus; to Au6(CO)9 &minus; are observed to be almost identical to that of Au6(CO)6 &minus;, suggesting that the additional CO&rsquo;s are simply physisorbed onto the Au6(CO)6 &minus; core. Quasirelativistic density functional calculations are performed on both Au6(CO)n and Au6(CO)n &minus; (n = 4-6). The theoretical results are used to interpret the experimental observations and provide insight into the nature of CO interactions with gold clusters. The Au6 cluster is shown to be highly fluxional upon multiple CO adsorptions, stabilizing structures with more apex sites to accommodate the additional CO&rsquo;s. The CO-induced structural transformation is analogous to structural flexibility and mobility in heterogeneous catalysis.

               <span class="abstract">Photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted for a series of (CrO3)n- (n = 1-5) clusters and compared with density functional calculations.  Well-resolved photoelectron spectra were obtained for (CrO3)n- (n = 1-5) at 193 nm (6.424 eV) and 157 nm (7.866 eV) photon energies, allowing for accurate measurements of the electron binding energies, low-lying electronic excitations for n = 1 and 2, and the energy gaps.  Density functional and molecular orbital theory (CCSD(T)) calculations were performed to locate the ground and low-lying excited states for the neutral clusters and to calculate the electron binding energies of the anionic species.  The experimental and computational studies firmly establish the unique low-spin, non-planar, cyclic ring structures for (CrO3)n and (CrO3)n- for n &ge; 3.  The structural parameters of (CrO3)n are shown to converge rapidly to those of the bulk CrO3 crystal.  The extra electron in (CrO3)n- (n &ge; 2) is shown to be largely delocalized over all Cr centers, in accord with the relatively sharp ground state photoelectron bands.  The measured energy gaps of (CrO3)n exhibit a sharp increase from n = 1 to n = 3 and approach to the bulk value of 2.25 eV at n = 4 and 5, consistent with the convergence of the structural parameters.  </span>

               <span class="abstract">The Au-O and Au-S interactions are essential in nanogold catalysis and nanotechnology, for which mono-gold oxide and sulfide clusters serve as the simplest molecular models. We report a combined photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio study on AuO&minus; and AuO2&minus; and their valent isoelectronic AuS&minus; and AuS2&minus; species to probe their electronic structure and to elucidate the Au-O and Au-S chemical bonding. Vibrationally-resolved spectra were obtained at different photon energies, providing a wealth of electronic structure information for each species. Similar spectra were observed for AuO&minus; and AuS&minus; and for the linear OAuO&minus; and SAuS&minus; species. A bent isomer was also observed as Au(S2)&minus; in the AuS2&minus; spectra, whereas a similar Au(O2)&minus; complex was not observed in the case of AuO2&minus;. High-level ab initio calculations were conducted to aid spectral assignments and provide insight into the chemical bonding in the AuX&minus; and AuX2&minus; molecules. Excellent agreement is achieved between the calculated electronic excitations and the observed spectra. Configuration interactions and spin-orbit couplings were shown to be important and were necessary to achieve good agreement between theory and experiment. Strong covalent bonding was found in both the AuX&minus; and the XAuX&minus; species with multiple bonding characters. While Au(S2)&minus; was found to be a low-lying isomer with a significant binding energy, Au(O2)&minus; was shown to be unbound consistent with the experimental observation. The latter is understood in the context of the size-dependent reactivity of Aun&minus; clusters with O2.</span>

               <span class="abstract">Aromaticity is an important concept in chemistry primarily for hydrocarbon compounds, but it has been extended to compounds containing transition-metal atoms.  Recent findings of aromaticity and antiaromaticy in all-metal clusters have stimulated further researches in describing the chemical bonding, structures, and stability in transition-metal clusters and compounds on the basis of aromaticity and antiaromaticity, which are reviewed here.  The presence of d-orbitals endows much more diverse chemistry, structure, and chemical bonding to transition-metal clusters and compounds.  One interesting feature is the existence of a new type of &#61540;-aromaticity, in addition to &#61555;- and &#61552;-aromaticity that are only possible for main group compounds.  Another striking characteristic in the chemical bonding of transition-metal systems is the multi-fold nature of aromaticity, antiaromaticity, or even conflicting aromaticity.  Separate sets of counting rules have been proposed for cyclic transition-metal systems to account for the three types of &#61555;-, &#61552;-, and &#61540;-aromaticity/antiaromaticity.  The diverse transition-metal clusters and compounds reviewed here indicate that multiple aromaticity and antiaromaticity may be much more common in chemistry than one would anticipate.  It is hoped that the current review will stimulate interest in further understanding the structure and bonding, on the basis of aromaticity and antiaromaticity, of other known or unknown transition-metal systems, such as the active sites of enzymes or other biomolecules, which contain transition-metal atoms and clusters.  </span>

               <span class="abstract">BO- is isoelectronic with CN-.1 However, in comparison to CN-, which is an important ligand in inorganic and biomolecules, the chemistry of BO- is relatively unknown. The electron affinity (EA) of BO (2.51 eV)2,3 is much smaller than that of CN (3.86 eV),4 which may explain the fact that CN- is a stable anion in solution, but BO- is not. However, the electronic structure and bond strength of BO- are similar to those of CN-, suggesting that it may be a robust chemical unit and can retain its structural integrity in chemical compounds. In a recent study, we indeed found that BO behaves like a monovalent structural unit in its bonding to Au in AunBO- (n ) 1-3) clusters.5 Theoretical calculations also suggested that carbon boronyls (CBO)n (n ) 3-7) are stable species on the potential-energy surfaces.6 Here we report a photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and theoretical study on two boron oxide clusters, B3O2 - and B4O3 -, which are shown to possess a D&yen;h (3&ordf;g) linear and D3h (2A2&cent;&cent;) triangular structure, respectively, and can be viewed as two and three boronyl groups bonded to a single B atom.</span>

               <span class="abstract">Vanadium oxide clusters, (V2O5)n, have been predicted to possess interesting polyhedral cage structures, which may serve as ideal molecular models for oxide surfaces and catalysts.  Here we examine the electronic properties of these oxide clusters via anion photoelectron spectroscopy for (V2O5)n &minus; (n = 2-4), as well as for the 4d/5d species, Nb4O10 &minus; and Ta4O10 &minus;. Wellresolved photoelectron spectra have been obtained at 193 and 157 nm and used to compare with density functional calculations. Very high electron affinities and large HOMO-LUMO gaps are observed for all the (V2O5)n clusters. The HOMO-LUMO gaps of (V2O5)n, all exceeding that of the band gap of the bulk oxide, are found to increase with cluster size from n = 2-4. For the M4O10 clusters, we find that the Nb/Ta species yield similar spectra, both possessing lower electron affinities and larger HOMO-LUMO gaps relative to V4O10. The structures of the anionic and neutral clusters are optimized; the calculated electron binding energies and excitation spectra for the global minimum cage structures are in good agreement with the experiment.  Evidence is also observed for the predicted trend of electron delocalization versus localization in the (V2O5)n &minus; clusters. Further insights are provided pertaining to the potential chemical reactivities of the oxide clusters and properties of the bulk oxides.</span>

The two anions are best considered as W2O6(O2-) and W3O9(O2-), respectively, each containing a side-on bound superoxide ligand, whereas the neutral clusters W2O8 and W3O11 are shown to involve O2 physisorbed to the W2O6 or W3O9 stoichiometric cluster.  The current study indicates that the extra electron in W2O6- and W3O9- are capable of activating dioxygen by non-dissociative electron transfer (W 5d - O2 -*), and the two anionic clusters can be viewed as models for reduced defect sites on tungsten oxide surfaces for the chemisorption of O2.  </span>
