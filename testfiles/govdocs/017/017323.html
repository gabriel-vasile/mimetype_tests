               <span class="abstract">The ability to control ion temperatures is critical for gas phase spectroscopy and has been a challenge in chemical physics. A low-temperature photoelectron spectroscopy instrument has been developed for the investigation of complex anions in the gas phase, including multiply charged anions, solvated species, and biological molecules. The new apparatus consists of an electrospray ionization source, a 3D Paul trap for ion accumulation and cooling, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a magnetic-bottle photoelectron analyzer. A key feature of the new instrument is the capability to cool and tune ion temperatures from 10 to 350 K in the 3D Paul trap, which is attached to the cold head of a closed-cycle helium refrigerator. Ion cooling is accomplished in the Paul trap via collisions with a background gas and has been demonstrated by observation of complete elimination of vibrational hot bands in photoelectron spectra of various anions ranging from small molecules to complex species. Further evidence of ion cooling is shown by the observation of H2 physisorbed anions at low temperatures. Cold anions result in better resolved photoelectron spectra due to the elimination of vibrational hot bands and yield more accurate energetic and spectroscopic information. Temperature-dependent studies are made possible for weakly-bonded molecular and solvated clusters, allowing thermodynamic information to be obtained.</span>

               <span class="abstract">C120O comprises two C60 cages linked by a furan ring and is formed by reactions of C60O and C60.  We have produced doubly-charged anions of this fullerene dimer (C120O2&ndash;) and studied its electronic structure and stability using photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.  High resolution and vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra were obtained at 70 K and at several photon energies.  The second electron affinity of C120O was measured to be 1.02 &plusmn; 0.03 eV and the intramolecular Coulomb repulsion was estimated to be about 0.8 eV in C120O2&ndash; on the basis of the observed repulsive Coulomb barrier.  A low-lying excited state (2B1) was also observed for C120O&ndash; at 0.09 eV above the ground state (2A1).  The C120O2&ndash; dianion can be viewed as a single electron on each C60 ball very weakly coupled.  Theoretical calculations showed that the singlet and triplet states of C120O2&ndash; are nearly degenerate and can both be present in the experiment.  The computed electron binding energies and excitation energies, as well as Franck-Condon factors, are used to help interpret the photoelectron spectra.  A C-C bond-cleaved isomer, C60-O-C602&ndash;, was also observed with a higher electron binding energy of 1.54 eV.  </span>

               <span class="abstract">We report direct observation of entropic effect in determining the folding of a linear dicarboxylate dianion with a flexible aliphatic chain [&ndash;O2C-(CH2)6-CO2&ndash;] by photoelectron spectroscopy as a function of temperature (18 &ndash; 300 K) and degree of solvation from 1 to 18 water molecules. A folding transition is observed to occur at 16 solvent water molecules at room temperature, but at 14 solvent molecules below 120 K due to the entropic effect. The &ndash;O2C-(CH2)6-CO2&ndash;(H2O)14 hydrated cluster exhibits interesting temperature-dependent behaviors and its ratio of folded over linear conformations can be precisely controlled as a function of temperature, yielding the enthalpy and entropy differences between the two conformations. A folding barrier is observed at very low temperatures, resulting in kinetic trapping of the linear conformation. The current work provides a simple model system to study the dynamics and entropic effect in complex systems and may be important for understanding the hydration and conformation changes of biological molecules.</span>

               <span class="abstract">The electronic structure and chemical bonding in the Ta3&minus; cluster are investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Photoelectron spectra are obtained for Ta3&minus; at four photon energies: 532, 355, 266 and 193 nm. While congested spectra are observed at high electron binding energies, several low-lying electronic transitions are well resolved and compared with the theoretical calculations. The electron affinity of Ta3 is determined to be 1.35&plusmn;0.03 eV. Extensive density functional calculations are performed at the B3LYP/Stuttgart +2f1g level to locate the ground state and low-lying isomers for Ta3 and Ta3 &minus;.  The ground state for the Ta3 &minus; anion is shown to be a quintet (5A1&prime;) with D3h symmetry, whereas two nearly isoenergetic states, C2v (4A1) and D3h (6A1&prime;), are found to compete for the ground state for neutral Ta3. A detailed molecular orbital analysis is performed to elucidate the chemical boding in Ta3&minus;, which is found to possess multiple d-orbital aromaticity, commensurate with its highly symmetric D3h structure.</span>

               <span class="abstract">Properties of multiply charged anions are dominated by the intramolecular Coulomb repulsion (ICR). Using photoelectron imaging, we show the effect of ICR on photoelectron angular distributions for a series of dianions, -O2C(CH2)nCO2 -(Dn2-). The observed photoemission band of Dn2- was due to a perpendicular transition from the charged end group.  However, photoemission intensities were observed to peak along the laser polarization for smaller n due to the strong ICR that forces electrons to be emitted along the molecular axis. This emission pattern weakens with increasing n and at D112- the angular distribution reverses back to peak at the perpendicular direction due to the reduced ICR.</span>

               <span class="abstract">We report the observation of negative electron binding energies in a triply charged anion, 1-hydroxy-3,6,8-pyrene-trisulfonate (HPTS3&ndash;).  Low-temperature photoelectron spectra were obtained for HPTS3&ndash; at several photon energies, revealing three detachment features below 0 electron binding energy.  The HPTS3&ndash; trianion was measured to possess a negative electron binding of -0.66 eV.  Despite the relatively high excess energy stored in HPTS3&ndash;, it was observed to be a long-lived anion due to its high repulsive Coulomb barrier (~3.3 eV), which prevents spontaneous electron emission.  Theoretical calculations were carried out, which confirmed the negative electron binding energies observed.  The calculations further showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital in HPTS3&ndash; is an anti-bonding &#61552; orbital on the pyrene rings, followed by lone pair electrons in the peripheral &ndash;SO3&ndash; groups.  Negative electron binding energy is a unique feature of multiply-charged anions due to the presence of the repulsive Coulomb barrier.  Such metastable species may be good models to study electron-electron and vibronic interactions in complex molecules.  </span>

               <span class="abstract">High energy photon is needed for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) of anions with high electron binding energies, such as superhalogens and O-rich metal oxide clusters. The highest energy photon used for anion PES in the laboratory has been 157 nm (7.866 eV) from F2 eximer lasers. Here, we report an anion PES experiment using coherent vacuum ultraviolet radiation at 118.2 nm (10.488 eV) by tripling the third harmonic output (355 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser in a Xe/Ar cell. Our study focuses on a set of superhalogen species, MCl4 &minus; (M=Sc, Y, La), which were expected to possess very high electron binding energies. While the 157 nm photon can only access the ground state detachment features for these species, more transitions to the excited states at binding energies higher than 8 eV are observed at 118.2 nm. The adiabatic detachment energies are shown to be, 6.84, 7.02, and 7.03 eV for ScCl4 &minus;, YCl4 &minus;, and LaCl4 &minus; eV, respectively, whereas their corresponding vertical detachment energies are measured to be 7.14, 7.31, and 7.38 eV.</span>

               <span class="abstract">Photoelectron spectroscopy is combined with ab initio calculations to study the microsolvation of the dicyanamide anion, N(CN)2 -. Photoelectron spectra of [N(CN)2-] (H2O)n (n = 0-12) have been measured at room temperature and also at low temperature for n= 0-4. Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra are obtained for N(CN)2-, allowing the electron affinity of the N(CN)2 radical to be determined accurately as 4.135 &plusmn;0.010 eV. The electron binding energies and the spectral width of the hydrated clusters are observed to increase with the number of water molecules. The first five waters are observed to provide significant stabilization to the solute, whereas the stabilization becomes weaker for n &gt; 5. The spectral width, which carries information about the solvent reorganization upon electron detachment in [N(CN)2-](H2O)n, levels off for n &gt; 6. Theoretical calculations reveal several close-lying isomers for n= 1 and 2 due to the fact that the N(CN)2- anion possesses three almost equivalent hydration sites. In all the hydrated clusters, the most stable structures consist of a water cluster solvating one end of the N(CN)2- anion.</span>

Vibrationally resolved spectra are obtained for both the singly and doubly charged species and for n = 78 and 84 transitions from different isomers are also observed.  The electron affinities (EA&rsquo;s) of C76, C78, and C84 are accurately determined to be 2.975&plusmn;0.010 eV for C76, 3.20&plusmn;0.01 eV for C78(C2v), 3.165&plusmn;0.010 eV for C78(D3), 3.23&plusmn;0.02 for C78(C2v&rsquo;), 3.185&plusmn;0.010 eV for C84(D2), and 3.26&plusmn;0.02 eV for C84(D2d).  The second EA&rsquo;s of the higher fullerenes, which represent the electronic stability of the doubly charged anions, are measured to be 0.325&plusmn;0.010 eV for C76, 0.44&plusmn;0.02 eV for C78(C2v), 0.53&plusmn;0.02 eV for C78(D3), 0.60&plusmn;0.04 eV for C78(C2v&rsquo;), 0.615&plusmn;0.010 eV for C84(D2d), and 0.82&plusmn;0.01 eV for C84(D2).  The spectra of the dianions are observed to be similar to that of the singly charged anions, suggesting that the charging induces relatively small structural changes to the fullerene cages.  The onsite Coulomb repulsions in the doubly charged fullerenes are directly measured from the differences of the first and second EA&rsquo;s and reveal strong correlation effects between the two extra electrons.  The repulsive Coulomb barriers in the doubly charged fullerenes are estimated from the cutoff in the photoelectron spectra and are found to be consistent with estimates from an electrostatic model.  </span>
