<H3>Andr&eacute Breton, <CITE>What is Surrealism?</CITE></H3>


At the beginning of the war of 1870 (he was to die four months later,
aged twenty-four), the author of the <CITE>Chants de Maldoror</CITE>
and of <CITE>Poésies</CITE>, Isidore Ducasse, better known by the name
of Comte de Lautréamont, whose thought has been of the very greatest
help and encouragement to myself and my friends throughout the fifteen
years during which we have succeeded in carrying a common activity,
made the following remark, among many others which were to electrify
us fifty years later: &#147At the hour in which I write, new tremors
are running through the intellectual atmosphere; it is only a matter
of having the courage to face them.&#148 1868-75: it is impossible,
looking back upon the past, to perceive an epoch so <I>poetically</I>
rich, so victorious, so revolutionary and so charged with distant
meaning as that which stretches from the separate publication of the
<CITE>Premier Chant de Maldoror</CITE> to the insertion in a letter to
Ernest Delahaye of Rimbauld's last poem, <CITE>Rêve</CITE>, which has
not so far been included in his <CITE>Complete Works</CITE>. It is not
an idle hope to wish to see the works of Lautréamont and Rimbaud
restored to their correct historical background: the coming and the
immediate results of the war of 1870. Other and analogous cataclysms
could not have failed to rise out of that military and social
cataclysm whose final episode was to be the atrocious crushing of the
Paris Commune; the last in date caught many of us at the very age when
Lautréamont and Rimbaud found themselves thrown into the preceding
one, and by way of revenge has had as its consequence&#151and this is
the new and important fact&#151the triumph of the Bolshevik
Revolution. <P>

I should say that to people socially and politically uneducated as we
then were&#151we who, on one hand, came for the most part from the
petite-bourgeoisie, and on the other, were all by vocation possessed
with the desire to intervene upon the artistic plane&#151the days of
October, which only the passing of the years and the subsequent
appearance of a large number of works within the reach of all were
fully to illumine, could not there and then have appeared to turn so
decisive a page in history. We were, I repeat, ill-prepared and
ill-informed. Above all, we were exclusively preoccupied with a
campaign of systematic refusal, exasperated by the conditions under
which, in such an age, we were forced to live. But our refusal did not
stop there; it was insatiable and knew no bounds. Apart from the
incredible stupidity of the arguments which attempted to legitimize
our participation in an enterprise such as the war, whose issue left
us completely indifferent, this refusal was directed&#151and having been
brought up in such a school, we are not capable of <I>changing</I> so
much that is no longer so directed&#151against the whole series of
intellectual, moral and social obligations that continually and from
all sides weigh down upon man and crush him. Intellectually, it was
vulgar rationalism and chop logic that more than anything else formed
the causes of our horror and our destructive impulse; morally, it was
all duties: religious, civic and of the family; socially, it was work
(did not Rimbaud say: &#147Jamais je ne travaillerai, ô; flots de
feu!&#148 and also: &#147La main â; plume vaut la main â; charrue.
Quel si êcle â; mains! Je n'aurai jamais ma main!&#148). The more I
think about it, the more certain I become that nothing was to our
minds worth saving, unless it was... unless it was, at last
&#147l'amour la poésie,&#148 to take the bright and trembling title of
one of Paul Eluard's books, &#147l'amour la poésie,&#148 considered as
inseparable in their essence and as the sole good. Between the
negation of this good, a negation brought to its climax by the war,
and its full and total affirmation (&#147Poetry should be made by all,
not one&#148), the field was not, to our minds, open to anything but a
Revolution truly extended into all domains, improbably radical, to the
highest degree impractical and tragically destroying within itself the
whole time the feeling that it brought with it both of desirability
and of absurdity. Many of you, no doubt, would put this down to a
certain youthful exaltation and to the general savagery of the time; I
must, however, insist on this attitude, common to particular men and
manifesting itself at periods nearly half a century distant from one
another. I should affirm that in ignorance of this attitude one can
form no idea of what surrealism really stands for. This attitude alone
can account, and very sufficiently at that, for all the excesses that
may be attributed to us but which cannot be deplored unless one
gratuitously supposes that we could have started from any other point.
The ill-sounding remarks, that are imputed to us, the so-called
inconsiderate attacks, the insults, the quarrels, the scandals&#151all
things that we are so much reproached with&#151turned up on the same
road as the surrealist poems. From the very beginning, the surrealist
attitude has had that in common with Lautréamont and Rimbaud which
once and for all binds our lot to theirs, and that is wartime
<I>defeatism</I>. <P>

I am not afraid to say that this <I>defeatism</I> seems to be more
relevant than ever. &#147New tremors are running through the
intellectual atmosphere; it is only a matter of having the courage to
face them.&#148 They are, in fact, <I>always</I> running through the
intellectual atmosphere: the problem of their propagation and
interpretation remains the same and, as far as we are concerned,
remains to be solved. But, paraphrasing Lautréamont, I cannot refrain
from adding that at the hour in which I speak, old and mortal shivers
are trying to substitute themselves for those which are the very
shivers of knowledge and of life. They come to announce a frightful
disease, a disease followed by the deprivation of all rights; it is
only a matter of having the courage to face them also. This disease is
called fascism. <P>

Let us be careful today not to underestimate the peril: the shadow has
greatly advanced over Europe recently. Hitler, Dolfuss and Mussolini
have either drowned in blood or subjected to corporal humiliation
everything that formed the effort of generations straining towards a
more tolerable and more worthy form of existence. In capitalist
society, hypocrisy and cynicism have now lost all sense of proportion
and are becoming more outrageous every day. Without making exaggerated
sacrifices to humanitarianism, which always involves impossible
reconciliations and truces to the advantage of the stronger, i should
say that in this atmosphere, thought cannot consider the exterior
world without an immediate shudder. Everything we know about fascism
shows that it is precisely the homologation of this state of affairs,
aggravated to its furthest point by the lasting resignation that it
seeks to obtain from those who suffer. Is not the evident role of
fascism to re-establish for the time being the tottering supremacy of
finance-capital? Such a role is of itself sufficient to make it worthy
of all our hatred; we continue to consider this feigned resignation as
one of the greatest evils that can possibly be inflicted upon beings
of our kind, and those who would inflict it deserve, in our opinion,
to be beaten like dogs. Yet it is impossible to conceal the fact that
this immense danger is there, lurking at our doors, that it has made
its appearance within our walls, and that it would be pure byzantinism
to dispute too long, as in Germany, over the choice of the barrier to
be set up against it, when all the while, <I>under several
aspects</I>, it is creeping nearer and nearer to us. During the course
of taking various steps with a view to contributing, in so far as I am
capable, to the organization in Paris of the anti-fascist struggle, I
have noticed that already a certain doubt has crept into the
intellectual circles of the left as to the possibility of successfully
combating fascism, a doubt which has unfortunately infected even those
elements whom one might have thought it possible to rely on and who
had come to the fore in this struggle. Some of them have even begun to
make excuses for the loss of the battle already. Such dispositions
seem to me to be so dismaying that i should not care to be speaking
here without first having made clear my position in relation to them,
or without anticipating a whole series of remarks that are to follow,
affirming that today, more than ever before, <I>the liberation of the
mind</I>, demands as primary condition, in the opinion of the
surrealists, the express aim of surrealism, <I>the liberation of
man</I>, which implies that we must struggle with our fetters with all
the energy of despair; that today more than ever before the
surrealists entirely rely for the bringing about of the liberation of
man upon the proletarian Revolution. <P>

I now feel free to turn to the object of this pamphlet, which is to
attempt to explain what surrealism is. A certain immediate ambiguity
contained in the word surrealism, is, in fact, capable of leading one
to suppose that it designates I know not what transcendental attitude,
while, on the contrary it expresses&#151and always has expressed for
us&#151a desire to deepen the foundations of the real, to bring about
an even clearer and at the same time ever more passionate
consciousness of the world perceived by the senses. The whole
evolution of surrealism, from its origins to the present day, which i
am about to retrace, shows that our unceasing wish, growing more and
more urgent from day to day, has been at all costs to avoid
considering a system of thought as a refuge, to pursue our
investigations with eyes wide open to their outside consequences, and
to assure ourselves that the results of these investigations would be
capable of facing the <I>breath of the street</I>. At the limits, for
many years past&#151or more exactly, since the conclusion of what one
may term the purely <I>intuitive</I> epoch of surrealism
(1919-25)&#151at the limits, I say, we have attempted to present
interior reality and exterior reality as two elements in process of
unification, or finally becoming <I>one</I>. This final unification is
the supreme aim of surrealism: interior reality and exterior reality
being, in the present form of society, in contradiction (and in this
contradiction we seethe very cause of man's unhappiness, but also the
source of his movement), we have assigned to ourselves the task of
confronting these two realities with one another on every possible
occasion, of refusing to allow the preeminence of the one over the
other, yet not of acting on the one and on the other <I>both at
once</I>, for that would be to suppose that they are less apart from
one another than they are (and I believe that those who pretend that
they are acting on both simultaneously are either deceiving us or are
a prey to a disquieting illusion); of acting on these two realities
not both at once, then, but one after the other, in a systematic
manner, allowing us to observe their reciprocal attraction and
interpenetration and to give to this interplay of forces all the
extension necessary for the trend of these two adjoining realities to
become one and the same thing. <P>

As I have just mentioned in passing, I consider that one can
distinguish two epochs in the surrealist movement, of equal duration,
from its origins (1919, year of the publication of <CITE>Champs
Magnétiques</CITE>) until today; a purely <I>intuitive</I> epoch, and
a <I>reasoning</I> epoch. The first can summarily be characterized by
the belief expressed during this time in the all-powerfulness of
thought, considered capable of freeing itself by means of its own
resources. This belief witnesses to a prevailing view that I look upon
today as being extremely mistaken, the view that <I>thought is supreme
over matter</I>. The definition of surrealism that has passed into the
dictionary, a definition taken from the <CITE>Manifesto</CITE> of
1924, takes account only of this entirely idealist disposition and
(for voluntary reasons of simplification and amplification destined to
influence in my mind the future of this definition) does so in terms
that suggest that I deceived myself at the time in advocating the use
of an automatic thought not only removed from all control exercised by
the reason but also disengaged from <CITE>&#147all aesthetic or moral
preoccupations.&#148</CITE> It should at least have been said:
<I>conscious</I> aesthetic or moral preoccupations. During the period
under review, in the absence, of course, of all seriously discouraging
exterior events, surrealist activity remained strictly confined to its
first theoretical premise, continuing all the while to be the vehicle
of that total &#147non-conformism&#148 which, as we have seen, was the
binding feature in the coming together of those who took part in it,
and the cause, during the first few years after the war, of an
uninterrupted series of adhesions. No coherent political or social
attitude, however, made its appearance until 1925, that is to say (and
it is important to stress this), until the outbreak of the Moroccan
war, which, re-arousing in us our particular hostility to the way
armed conflicts affect man, abruptly placed before us the necessity of
making a public protest. This protest, which, under the title <CITE>La
Révolution d'Abord et Toujours</CITE> (October 1925), joined the name
of the surrealists proper to those of thirty other intellectuals, was
undoubtedly rather confused ideologically; it none the less marked the
breaking away from a whole way of thinking; it none the less created a
precedent that was to determine the whole future direction of the
movement. Surrealist activity, faced with a brutal, revolting,
<I>unthinkable</I> fact, was forced to ask itself what were its proper
resources and to determine their <I>limits</I>; it was forced to adopt
a precise attitude, exterior to itself, in order to continue to face
whatever exceeded these limits. Surrealist activity at this moment
entered into its <I>reasoning</I> phase. It suddenly experienced the
necessity of crossing over the gap that separates absolute idealism
from dialectical materialism. This necessity made its appearance in so
urgent a manner that we had to consider the problem in the clearest
possible light, with the result that for some months we devoted our
entire attention to the means of bringing about this change of front
once and for all. If I do not today feel any retrospective
embarrassment in explaining this change, that is because it seems to
me quite natural that surrealist thought, before coming to rest in
dialectical materialism and insisting, as today, on the <I>supremacy
of matter over mind</I>, should have been condemned to pass, in a few
years, through the whole historic development of modern thought. It
came <I>normally</I> to Marx through Hegel, just as it came
<I>normally</I> to Hegel through Berkeley and Hume. These latter
influences offer a certain particularity in that, contrary to certain
poetic influences undergone in the same way, and accommodated to those
of the French materialists of the eighteenth century, they yielded a
residuum of <I>practical action</I>. To try and hide these influences
would be contrary to my desire to show that surrealism has not been
drawn up as an abstract system, that is to say, safeguarded against
all contradictions. It is also my desire to show how surrealist
activity, driven, as I have said, to ask itself what were its proper
resources, had in some way or another to <I>reflect upon itself</I>
its realization, in 1925, of its relative insufficiency; how
surrealist activity had to cease being content with the results
(automatic texts, the recital of dreams, improvised speeches,
spontaneous poems, drawings and actions) which it had originally
planned; and how it came to consider these first results as being
simply so much <I>material</I>, starting from which the problem of
knowledge inevitably arose again under quite a new form. <P>

As a <I>living</I> movement, that is to say a movement undergoing a
constant process of becoming and, what is more, solidly relying on
concrete facts, surrealism has brought together and is still bringing
together diverse temperaments individually obeying or resisting a
variety of bents. The determinant of their enduring or short-lived
adherence is not to be considered as a blind concession to an inert
stock of ideas held in common, but as a continuous sequence of acts
which, propelling the doer to more or less distant points, forces him
for each fresh start to return to the same starting-line. These
exercises not being without peril, one man may break a limb or&#151for
which there is no precedent&#151his head, another may peaceably submerge
himself in a quagmire or report himself dying of fatigue. Unable as
yet to treat itself to an ambulance, surrealism simply leaves these
individuals by the wayside. Those who continue in the ranks are aware
of course of the casualties left behind them. But what of it? The
essential is always to look ahead, to remain sure that one has not
forfeited the burning desire for beauty, truth and justice, toilingly
to go onwards towards the discovery, one by one, of <I>fresh
landscapes</I>, and to continue doing so indefinitely and without
coercion to the end, that others may afterwards travel the same
spiritual road, <I>unhindered and in all security</I>. Penetration, to
be sure, has not been as deep as one would have wished. Poetically
speaking, a few wild, or shall we say charming, beasts whose cries
fill the air and bar access to a domain as yet only surmised, are
still far from being exorcized. But for all that, the piercing of the
thicket would have proceeded less tortuously, and those who are doing
the pioneering would have acquitted themselves with unabating tenacity
in the service of the cause, if, between the beginning and the end of
the spectacle which they provide for themselves and would be glad to
provide for others, a change had not taken place. <P>

In 193(6), more than ever before, surrealism owes it to itself to
defend the postulate of the necessity of change. It is amusing,
indeed, to see how the more spiteful and silly of our adversaries
affect to triumph whenever they stumble on some old statement we may
have made and which now sounds more or less discordantly in the midst
of others intended to render comprehensible our present conduct. This
insidious manoeuvre, which is calculated to cast a doubt on our good
faith, or at least on the genuineness of our principles, can easily be
defeated. The development of surrealism throughout the decade of its
existence is, we take it, a function of the unrolling of historical
realities as these may be speeded up between the period of relief
which follows the conclusion of a peace and the fresh outbreak of war.
It is also a function of the process of seeking after new values in
order to confirm or invalidate existing ones. The fact that certain of
the first participants in surrealist activity have thrown in the
sponge and have been discarded has brought about the retiring from
circulation of some ways of thinking and the putting into circulation
of others in which there were implicit certain general dissents on the
one hand and certain general assents on the other. Hence it is that
this activity has been fashioned by the events. At the present moment,
contrary to current biased rumour according to which surrealism itself
is supposed, in its cruelty of disposition, to have sacrificed nearly
all the blood first vivifying it, it is heartening to be able to point
out that it has never ceased to avail itself of the perfect teamwork
of René Crevel, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Benjamin Péret, Man Ray,
Tristan Tzara, and the present writer, all of whom can attest that
from the inception of the movement&#151which is also the date of our
enlistment in it&#151until now, the initial principle of their
covenant has never been violated. If there have occurred differences
on some points, it was essentially within the rhythmic scope of the
integral whole, in itself a least disputable element of objective
value. The others, they whom we no longer meet, can they say as much?
They cannot, for the simple reason that since they separated from us
they have been incapable of achieving a single concerted action that
had any definite form of its own, and they have confined themselves,
instead, to a reaction against surrealism with the greatest wastage to
themselves&#151a fate always overtaking those who go back on their
past. The history of their apostasy and denials will ultimately be
read into the great limbo of human failings, without profit to any
observer&#151ideal yesterday, but real today&#151who, called upon to
make a pronouncement, will decide whether they or ourselves have
brought the more appreciable efforts to bear upon a rational solution
of the many problems surrealism has propounded. <P>

Although there can be no question here of going through the history of
the surrealist movement&#151its history has been told many a time and
sometimes told fairly well; moreover, I prefer to pass on as quickly
as possible to the exposition of its present attitude&#151I think I
ought briefly to recall, for the benefit of those of you who were
unaware of the fact, that there is no doubt that before the surrealist
movement properly so called, there existed among the promoters of the
movement and others who later rallied round it, very active, not
merely dissenting but also antagonistic dispositions which, between
1915 and 1920, were willing to align themselves under the signboard of
<I>Dada</I>. Post-war disorder, a state of mind essentially anarchic
that guided that cycle's many manifestations, a deliberate refusal to
judge&#151for lack, it was said, of criteria&#151the actual qualifications
of individuals, and, perhaps, in the last analysis, a certain spirit
of negation which was making itself conspicuous, had brought about a
dissolution of the group as yet inchoate, one might say, by reason of
its dispersed and heterogeneous character, a group whose germinating
force has nevertheless been decisive and, by the general consent of
present-day critics, has greatly influenced the course of ideas. It
may be proper before passing rapidly&#151as I must&#151over this period,
to apportion by far the handsomest share to Marcel Duchamp (canvases
and glass objects still to be seen in New York), to Francis Picabia
(reviews &#147291&#148 and &#147391&#148), Jacques Vaché
(<CITE>Lettres de Guerre</CITE>) and Tristan Tzara (<CITE>Twenty-five
Poems, Dada Manifesto</CITE> 1918). <P>

Strangely enough, it was round a discovery of language that there was
seeking to organize itself in 1920 what&#151as yet on a basis of
confidential exchange&#151assumed the name of <i>surrealism</i>, a word
fallen from the lips of Apollinaire, which we had diverted from the
rather general and very confusing connotation he had given it. What
was at first no more than a new method of poetic writing broke away
after several years from the much too general theses which had come to
be expounded in the <cite>Surrealist Manifesto&#151Soluble Fish</cite>,
1924, the <cite>Second Manifesto</cite> adding others to them, whereby
the whole was raised to a vaster ideological plane; and so there had
to be revision. <p>

In an article, &#147Enter the Mediums,&#148 published in
<cite>Littérature</cite>, 1922, reprinted in <cite>Les Pas
Perdus</cite>, 1924, and subsequently in the <cite>Surrealist
Manifesto</cite>, I explained the circumstance that had originally put
us, my friends and myself, on the track of the surrealist activity we
still follow and for which we are hopeful of gaining ever more
numerous new adherents in order to extend it further than we have so
far succeeded in doing. It reads: <p>

<blockquote>It was in 1919, in complete solitude and at the approach
of sleep, that my attention was arrested by sentences more or less
complete, which became perceptible to my mind without my being able to
discover (even by very meticulous analysis) any possible previous
volitional effort. One evening in particular, as I was about to fall
asleep, I became aware of a sentence articulated clearly to a point
excluding all possibility of alteration and stripped of all quality of
vocal sound; a curious sort of sentence which came to me bearing&#151in
sober truth&#151not a trace of any relation whatever to any incidents I
may at that time have been involved in; an insistent sentence, it
seemed to me, a sentence I might say, that <i>knocked at the
window</i>. I was prepared to pay no further attention to it when the
organic character of the sentence detained me. I was really
bewildered. Unfortunately, I am unable to remember the exact sentence
at this distance, but it ran approximately like this: &#147A man is
cut in half by the window.&#148 What made it plainer was the fact that
it was accompanied by a feeble visual representation of a man in the
process of walking, but cloven, at half his height, by a window
perpendicular to the axis of his body. Definitely, there was the form,
re-erected against space, of a man leaning out of a window. But the
window following the man's locomotion, I understood that I was dealing
with an image of great rarity. Instantly the idea came to me to use it
as material for poetic construction. I had no sooner invested it with
that quality, than it had given place to a succession of all but
intermittent sentences which left me no less astonished, but in a
state, I would say, of extreme detachment. <p>

Preoccupied as I still was at that time with Freud, and familiar with
his methods of investigation, which I had practised occasionally upon
the sick during the War, I resolved to obtain from myself what one
seeks to obtain from patients, namely a monologue poured out as
rapidly as possible, over which the subject's critical faculty has no
control&#151the subject himself throwing reticence to the winds&#151and
which as much as possible represents <i>spoken thought</i>. It seemed
and still seems to me that the speed of thought is no greater than
that of words, and hence does not exceed the flow of either tongue or
pen. It was in such circumstances that, together with Philippe
Soupault, whom I had told about my first ideas on the subject, I began
to cover sheets of paper with writing, feeling a praiseworthy contempt
for whatever the literary result might be. Ease of achievement brought
about the rest. By the end of the first day of the experiment we were
able to read to one another about fifty pages obtained in this manner
and to compare the results we had achieved. The likeness was on the
whole striking. There were similar faults of construction, the same
hesitant manner, and also, in both cases, an illusion of extraordinary
verve, much emotion, a considerable assortment of images of a quality
such as we should never have been able to obtain in the normal way of
writing, a very special sense of the picturesque, and, here and there,
a few pieces of out and out buffoonery. The only differences which our
two texts presented appeared to me to be due essentially to our
respective temperaments, Soupault's being less static than mine, and,
if he will allow me to make this slight criticism, to his having
scattered about at the top of certain pages&#151doubtlessly in a spirit
of mystification&#151various words under the guise of titles. I must
give him credit, on the other hand, for having always forcibly opposed
the least correction of any passage that did not seem to me to be
quite the thing. In that he was most certainly right. <p>

It is of course difficult in these cases to appreciate at their just
value the various elements in the result obtained; one may even say
that it is entirely impossible to appreciate them at a first reading.
To you who may be writing them, these elements are, in appearance,
<i>as strange as to anyone else</i>, and you are yourself naturally
distrustful of them. Poetically speaking, they are distinguished
chiefly by a very high degree of <i>immediate absurdity</i>, the
peculiar quality of that absurdity being, on close examination, their
yielding to whatever is most admissible and legitimate in the world:
divulgation of a given number of facts and properties on the whole not
less objectionable than the others.</blockquote> <p>

The word &#147surrealism&#148 having thereupon become descriptive of
the generalizable undertaking to which we had devoted ourselves, I
thought it indispensable, in 1924, to define this word once and for
all: <p>

<blockquote> SURREALISM, n. Pure psychic automatism, by which it is
intended to express, verbally, in writing, or by other means, the real
process of thought. Thought's dictation, in the absence of all control
exercised by the reason and outside all aesthetic or moral
preoccupations. <p>

ENCYCL. <i>Philos</i>. Surrealism rests in the belief in the superior
reality of certain forms of association neglected heretofore; in the
omnipotence of the dream and in the disinterested play of thought. It
tends definitely to do away with all other psychic mechanisms and to
substitute itself for them in the solution of the principal problems
of life. Have professed <i>absolute surrealism</i>: Messrs. Aragon,
Baron, Boiffard, Breton, Carrive, Crevel, Delteil, Desnos, Eluard,
Gérard, Limbour, Malkine, Morise, Naville, Noll, Péret, Picon,
Soupault, Vitrac. <p>

These till now appear to be the only ones.... Were one to consider
their output only superficially, a goodly number of poets might well
have passed for surrealists, beginning with Dante and Shakespeare at
his best. <i>In the course of many attempts I have made towards an
analysis of what, under false pretences, is called genius, I have
found nothing that could in the end be attributed to any other process
than this. </i></blockquote> <p>

There followed an enumeration that will gain, I think, by being
clearly set out thus: <p>

<blockquote>. . . Heraclitus is surrealist in dialectic. . . .<br>
Swift is surrealist in malice.<br>
Sade is surrealist in sadism. . . .<br>
Baudelaire is surrealist in morals.<br>
Rimbaud is surrealist in life and elsewhere. . . .<br>
Carroll is surrealist in nonsense. . . .<br>
Picasso is surrealist in cubism. . . .<br>
Etc. <p>

They were not always surrealists&#151on this I insist&#151in the sense
that one can disentangle in each of them a number of preconceived
notions to which&#151very naïvely!&#151they clung. And they clung to them
so because they had not heard the <i>surrealist voice</i>, the voice
that exhorts on the eve of death and in the roaring storm, and because
they were unwilling to dedicate themselves to the task of no more than
orchestrating the score replete with marvellous things. They were
proud instruments; hence the sounds they produced were not always
harmonious sounds. <p>

We, on the contrary, who have not given ourselves to processes of
filtering, who through the medium of our work have been content to be
the silent receptacles of so many echoes, modest <i>registering
machines</i> that are not hypnotized by the pattern that they trace,
we are perhaps serving a yet much nobler cause. So we honestly give
back the talent lent to us. You may talk of the &#147talent&#148 of
this yard of platinum, of this mirror, of this door and of this sky,
if you wish. <p>

We have no talent. . . . </blockquote> <p>

The <cite>Manifesto</cite> also contained a certain number of
practical recipes, entitled: &#147Secrets of the Magic Surrealist
Art,&#148 such as the following: <p>

<blockquote><i>Written Surrealist Composition or First and Last
Draft.</i><p>

Having settled down in some spot most conducive to the mind's
concentration upon itself, order writing material to be brought to
you. Let your state of mind be as passive and receptive as possible.
Forget your genius, talents, as well as the genius and talents of
others. Repeat to yourself that literature is pretty well the sorriest
road that leads to everywhere. Write quickly without any previously
chosen subject, quickly enough not to dwell on, and not to be tempted
to read over, what you have written. The first sentence will come of
itself; and this is self-evidently true, because there is never a
moment but some sentence alien to our conscious thought clamours for
outward expression. It is rather difficult to speak of the sentence to
follow, since it doubtless comes in for a share of our conscious
activity and so the other sentences, if it is conceded that the
writing of the first sentence must have involved even a minimum of
consciousness. But that should in the long run matter little, because
therein precisely lies the greatest interest in the surrealist
exercise. Punctuation of course necessarily hinders the stream of
absolute continuity which preoccupies us. But you should particularly
distrust the prompting whisper. If through a fault ever so trifling
there is a forewarning of silence to come, a fault let us say, of
inattention, break off unhesitatingly the line that has become too
lucid. After the word whose origin seems suspect you should place a
letter, any letter, <i>l</i> for example, always the letter <i>l</i>,
and restore the arbitrary flux by making that letter the initial of
the word to follow. </blockquote> <p>

I believe that the real interest of that book&#151there was no lack of
people who were good enough to concede interest, for which no
particular credit is due to me because I have no more than given
expression to sentiments shared with friends, present and
former&#151rests only subordinately on the formula above given. It is
rather confirmatory of a <i>turn of thought</i> which, for good or
ill, is peculiarly distinctive of our time. The defence originally
attempted of that turn of thought still seems valid to me in what
follows: <p>

<blockquote>We still live under the reign of logic, but the methods of
logic are applied nowadays only to the resolution of problems of
secondary in terest. The absolute rationalism which is still the
fashion does not permit consideration of any facts but those strictly
relevant to our experience. Logical ends, on the other hand, escape
us. Needless to say that even experience has had limits assigned to
it. It revolves in a cage from which it becomes more and more
difficult to release it. Even experience is dependent on immediate
utility, and common sense is its keeper. Under colour of civilization,
under pretext of progress, all that rightly or wrongly may be regarded
as fantasy or superstition has been banished from the mind, all
uncustomary searching after truth has been proscribed. It is only by
what must seem sheer luck that there has recently been brought to
light an aspect of mental life&#151to my belief by far the most
important&#151with which it was supposed that we no longer had any
concern. All credit for these discoveries must go to Freud. Based on
these discoveries a current of opinion is forming that will enable the
explorer of the human mind to continue his investigations, justified
as he will be in taking into account more than mere summary realities.
The imagination is perhaps on the point of reclaiming its rights. If
the depths of our minds harbour strange forces capable of increasing
those on the surface, or of successfully contending with them, then it
is all in our interest to canalize them, to canalize them first in
order to submit them later, if necessary, to the control of the
reason. The analysts themselves have nothing to lose by such a
proceeding. But it should be observed that there are no means designed
a priori for the bringing about of such an enterprise, that until the
coming of the new order it might just as well be considered the affair
of poets and scientists, and that its success will not depend on the
more or less capricious means that will be employed. . . . <p>

Interesting in a different way from the future of surrealist
<i>technics</i> (theatrical, philosophical, scientific, critical)
appears to me the application of surrealism to action. Whatever
reservations I might be inclined to make with regard to responsibility
in general, I should quite particularly like to know how the first
misdemeanours whose surrealist character is indubitable will be
<i>judged</i>. When surrealist methods extend from writing to action,
there will certainly arise the need of a new morality to take the
place of the current one, the cause of all our woes. <p>

The <cite>Manifesto of Surrealism</cite> has improved on the Rimbaud
principle that the poet must turn <i>seer</i>. Man in general is going
to be summoned to manifest through life those new sentiments which the
gift of vision will so suddenly have placed within his reach. . . .
</blockquote> <p>


Surrealism then was securing expression in all its purity and force.
The freedom it possesses is a perfect freedom in the sense that it
recognizes no limitations exterior to itself. As it was said on the
cover of the first issue of <cite>La Révolution Surréaliste,</cite>
&#147it will be necessary to draw up a new declaration of the Rights
of Man.&#148 The concept of surreality, concerning which quarrels have
been sought with us repeatedly and which it was attempted to turn into
a metaphysical or mystic rope to be placed afterwards round our necks,
lends itself no longer to misconstruction, nowhere does it declare
itself opposed to the need of transforming the world which henceforth
will more and more definitely yield to it. <p>

As I said in the <cite>Manifesto</cite>:<p>

<blockquote>I believe in the future transmutation of those two
seemingly contradictory states, dream and reality, into a sort of
absolute reality, of surreality, so to speak. I am looking forward to
its consummation, certain that I shall never share in it, but death
would matter little to me could I but taste the joy it will yield
ultimately. </blockquote> <p>

After years of endeavour and perplexities, when a variety of opinions
had disputed amongst themselves the direction of the craft in which a
number of persons of unequal ability and varying powers of resistance
had originally embarked together, the surrealist idea recovered in the
<cite>Second Manifesto</cite> all the brilliancy of which events had
vainly conspired to despoil it. It should be emphasized that the
<cite>First Manifesto</cite> of 1924 did no more than sum up the
conclusions we had drawn during what one may call the <i>heroic
epoch</i> of surrealism, which stretches from 1919 to 1923. The
concerted elaboration of the first automatic texts and our excited
reading of them, the first results obtained by Max Ernst in the domain
of &#147collage&#148 and of painting, the practice of surrealist
&#147speaking&#148 during the hypnotic experiments introduced among us
by René Crevel and repeated every evening for over a year,
uncontrovertibly mark the decisive stages of surrealist exploration
during this first phase. After that, up till the taking into account
of the social aspect of the problem round about 1925 (though not
formally sanctioned until 1930), surrealism began to find itself a
prey to characteristic wranglings. These wranglings account very
clearly for the expulsion orders and tickets-of-leave which, as we
went along, we had to deal out to certain of our companions of the
first and second hour. Some people have quite gratuitously concluded
from this that we are apt to overestimate <i>personal questions</i>.
During the last ten years, surrealism has almost unceasingly been
obliged to defend itself against deviations to the right and to the
left. On the one hand we have had to struggle against the will of
those who would maintain surrealism on a purely speculative level and
treasonably transfer it on to an artistic and literary plane (Artaud,
Desnos, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vitrac) at the cost of all the hope for
subversion we have placed in it; on the other, against the will of
those who would place it on a purely practical basis, available at any
moment to be sacrificed to an ill-conceived political militancy
(Naville, Aragon)&#151at the cost, this time, of what constitutes the
originality and reality of its researches, at the cost of the
autonomous risk that it has to run. Agitated though it was, the epoch
that separates the two <cite>Manifestos</cite> was none the less a
rich one, since it saw the publication of so many works in which the
vital principles of surrealism were amply accounted for. . . . <p>

It should be pointed out that in a number of declarations in <cite> La
Révolution et les Intellectuels. Que peuvent faire les
surréalistes?</cite> ( 1926), [Pierre Naville] demonstrated the utter
vanity of intellectual bickerings in the face of the human
exploitation which results from the wage-earning system. These
declarations gave rise amongst us to considerable anxiety and, at
tempting for the first time to justify surrealism's social
implications, I desired to put an end to it in <cite>Légitime Défense.
</cite> This pamphlet set out to demonstrate that there is no
fundamental antinomy in the basis of surrealist thought. In reality,
we are faced with two problems, one of which is the problem raised, at
the beginning of the twentieth century, by the discovery of the
relations between the conscious and the unconscious. That was how the
problem chose to present itself to us. We were the first to apply to
its resolution a particular method, which we have not ceased to
consider both the most suitable and the most likely to be brought to
perfection; there is no reason why we should renounce it. The other
problem we are faced with is that of the social action we should
pursue. We consider that this action has its own method in dialectical
materialism, and we can all the less afford to ignore this action
since, I repeat, we hold the liberation of man to be the <i>sine qua
non </i>condition of the <i>liberation of the mind</i>, and we can
expect this liberation of man to result only from the proletarian
Revolution. These two problems are essentially distinct and we deplore
their becoming confused by not remaining so. There is good reason,
then, to take up a stand against all attempts to weld them together
and, more especially, against the urge to abandon all such researches
as ours in order to devote ourselves to the poetry and art of
propaganda. Surrealism, which has been the object of brutal and
repeated summonses in this respect, now feels the need of making some
kind of counter-attack. Let me recall the fact that its very
definition holds that it must escape, in its written manifestations,
or any others, from all control exercised by the reason. Apart from
the puerility of wishing to bring a supposedly Marxist control to bear
on the immediate aspect of such manifestations, this control cannot be
envisaged in <i>principle</i>. And how ill-boding does this distrust
seem, coming as it does from men who declare themselves Marxists, that
is to say possessed not only of a strict line in revolutionary
matters, but also of a marvellously open mind and an insatiable
curiosity! <p>

This brings us to the eve of the <cite>Second Manifesto</cite>. These
objections had to be put an end to, and for that purpose it was
indispensable that we should proceed to liquidate certain
individualist elements amongst us, more or less openly hostile to one
another, whose intentions did not, in the final analysis, appear as
irreproachable, nor their motives as disinterested, as might have been
desired. An important part of the work was devoted to a statement of
the reasons which moved surrealism to dispense for the future with
certain collaborators. It was attempted, on the same occasion, to
complete the specific method of creation proposed six years earlier,
and thoroughly to tidy up surrealist ideas. . . . <p>

From 1930 until today the history of surrealism is that of successful
efforts to restore to it its proper <i>becoming</i> by gradually
removing from it every trace both of political opportunism and of
artistic opportunism. The review <cite>La Révolution
Surréaliste,</cite> (12 issues) has been succeeded by another,
<cite>Le Surréalisme au Service de la Révolution</cite> (6 issues).
Owing particularly to influences brought to bear by new elements,
surrealist experimenting. which had for too long been erratic, has
been unreservedly resumed; its perspectives and its aims have been
made perfectly clear; I may say that it has not ceased to be carried
on in a continuous and enthusiastic manner. This experimenting has
regained momentum under the master-impulse given to it by Salvador
Dali, whose exceptional interior &#147boiling&#148 has been for
surrealism, during the whole of this period, an invaluable ferment. As
Guy Mangeot has very rightly pointed out in his <cite>History of
Surrealism</cite> . . . Dali has endowed surrealism with an instrument
of primary importance, in particular the paranoiac-critical method,
which has immediately shown itself capable of being applied with equal
success to painting, poetry, the cinema, to the construction of
typical surrealist objects, to fashions, to sculpture and even, if
necessary, to all manner of exegesis. <p>

He first announced his convictions to us in <cite>La Femme
Visible</cite> (1930): <p>

<blockquote> I believe the moment is at hand when, by a paranoiac and
active advance of the mind, it will be possible (simultaneously with
automatism and other passive states) to systematize confusion and thus
to help to discredit completely the world of reality. </blockquote>
<p>

In order to cut short all possible misunderstandings, it should
perhaps be said: &#147immediate&#148 reality. <p>

<blockquote>Paranoia uses the external world in order to assert its
dominating idea and has the disturbing characteristic of making others
accept this idea's reality. The reality of the external world is used
for illustration and proof, and so comes to serve the reality of our
mind.</blockquote>

Surrealism, starting fifteen years ago with a discovery that seemed
only to involve poetic language, has spread like wildfire, on pursuing
its course, not only in art but in life. It has provoked new states of
consciousness and overthrown the walls beyond which it was
immemorially supposed to be impossible to see; it has&#151as is being
more and more generally recognized&#151modified the sensibility, and
taken a decisive step towards the unification of the personality,
which it found threatened by an ever more profound dissociation.
Without attempting to judge what direction it will ultimately take,
for the lands it fertilizes as it flows are those of surprise itself,
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that its most recent
advance is producing a <i>fundamental crisis of the
&#147object.&#148</i> It is essentially upon the object that
surrealism has thrown most light in recent years. Only the very close
examination of the many recent speculations to which the <i>object</i>
has publicly given rise (the oneiric object, the object functioning
symbolically, the real and virtual object, the moving but silent
object, the phantom object, the discovered object, etc.), can give one
a proper grasp of the experiments that surrealism is engaged in now.
In order to continue to understand the movement, it is indispensable
to focus one's attention on this point. <p>

I must crave your indulgence for speaking so technically, <i>from the
inside</i>. But there could be no question of concealing any aspect of
the persuasions to which surrealism has been and is still exposed. I
say that there exists a lyrical element that conditions <i>for one
part</i> the psychological and moral structure of human society, that
has conditioned it at all times and that will continue to condition
it. This lyrical element has until now, even though in spite of them,
remained the fact and <i>the sole fact</i> of specialists. In the
state of extreme tension to which class antagonisms have led the
society to which we belong and which we tend with all our strength to
reject, it is natural and it is <i>fated</i> that this solicitation
should continue, that it should assume for us a thousand faces,
imploring, tempting and eager by turns. It is not within our power, it
would be unworthy of our historic role to give way to this
solicitation. By surrealism we intend to account for nothing less than
the manner in which it is possible today to make use of the
magnificent and overwhelming <i>spiritual legacy</i> that has been
handed down to us. We have accepted this legacy from the past, and
surrealism can well say that the use to which it has been put has been
to turn it to the routing of capitalist society. I consider that for
that purpose it was and is still necessary for us to stand where we
are, to beware against breaking the thread of our researches and to
continue these researches, not as literary men and artists, certainly,
but rather as chemists and the various other kinds of technicians. To
pass on to the poetry and art called (doubtless in anticipation)
<i>proletarian:</i> No. The forces we have been able to bring together
and which for fifteen years we have never found lacking, have arrived
at a particular point of application: the question is not to know
whether this point of application is the best, but simply to point out
that the application of our forces at this point has given us up to an
activity that has proved itself valuable and fruitful on the plane on
which it was undertaken and has also been of a kind to engage us more
and more on the revolutionary plane. What it is essential to realize
is that no other activity could have produced such rich results, nor
could any other similar activity have been so effective in combating
the present form of society. On that point we have history on our
side. <p>

A comrade, Claude Cahun, in a striking pamphlet published recently:
<cite>Les Paris Sont Ouverts</cite>, a pamphlet that attempts to
predict the future of poetry by taking account both of its own laws
and of the social bases of its existence, takes Aragon to task for the
lack of rigour in his present position (I do not think anyone can
contest the fact that Aragon's poetry has perceptibly weakened since
he abandoned surrealism and undertook to place him self
<i>directly</i> at the service of the proletarian cause, which leads
one to suppose that such an undertaking has defeated him and is
proportionately more or less unfavourable to the Revolution).... It is
of particular interest that the author of <cite>Les Paris Sont
Ouverts</cite> has taken the opportunity of expressing himself from
the &#147historic&#148 point of view. His appreciation is as follows:
<p>

<blockquote>The most revolutionary experiment in poetry under the
capitalist regime having been incontestably, for France and perhaps
for Europe the Dadaist-surrealist experiment, in that it has tended to
destroy all the myths about art that for centuries have permitted the
ideologic as well as economic exploitation of painting, sculpture,
literature, etc. (e.g. the <i>frottages</i> of Max Ernst, which, among
other things, have been able to upset the scale of values of
art-critics and experts, values based chiefly on technical perfection,
personal touch and the lastingness of the materials employed), this
experiment can and should serve the cause of the liberation of the
proletariat. It is only when the proletariat has become aware of the
myths on which capitalist culture depends, when they have become aware
of what these myths and this culture mean for them and have destroyed
them, that they will be able to pass on to their own proper
development. The positive lesson of this negating experiment, that is
to say its transfusion among the proletariat, constitutes the only
valid revolutionary poetic propaganda.</blockquote <p>

Surrealism could not ask for anything better. Once the cause of the
movement is understood, there is perhaps some hope that, on the plane
of revolutionary militantism proper, our turbulence, our small
capacity for adaptation, until now, to the necessary rules of a party
(which certain people have thought proper to call our
&#147blanquism&#148), may be excused us. It is only too certain that
an activity such as ours, owing to its particularization, cannot be
pursued within the limits of any one of the existing revolutionary
organizations: it would be forced to come to a halt on the very
threshold of that organization. If we are agreed that such an activity
has above all tended to detach the intellectual creator from the
illusions with which bourgeois society has sought to surround him, I
for my part can only see in that tendency a further reason for
continuing our activity.<p>

None the less, the right that we demand and our desire to make use of
it depend, as I said at the beginning, on our remaining able to
continue our investigations without having to reckon, as for the last
few months we have had to do, with a sudden attack from the forces of
criminal imbecility. Let it be clearly understood that for us,
surrealists, the interests of thought can not cease to go hand in hand
with the interests of the working class, and that all attacks on
liberty, all fetters on the emancipation of the working class and all
armed attacks on it cannot fail to be considered by us as attacks on
thought likewise. I repeat, the danger is far from having been
removed. The surrealists cannot be accused of having been slow to
recognize the fact, since, on the very next day after the first
fascist coup in France, it was they amongst the intellectual circles
who had the honour of taking the initiative in sending out an <cite>
Appel à la lutte,</cite>, which appeared on February 10th, 1934,
furnished with twenty-four signatures. You may rest assured, comrades,
that they will not confine themselves, that already they have not
confined themselves, to this single act.
