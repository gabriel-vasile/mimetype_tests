        <p><a name="_Toc479070429"><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></a></p>
        <p>From 1992-1999, with USAID funding, CHF helped Poland transform its 
          housing sector to work in a new, market based economy. CHF equipped 
          indigenous, private, non-governmental organizations to deliver housing 
          to low- and middle-income families, and collaborated with local government 
          agencies as they became more responsive to local housing needs during 
          the housing delivery shift from public to private sector.</p>
        <p>In these projects, CHF acted as a catalyst, releasing existing resources 
          and helping private organizations and local governments to design and 
          implement new initiatives. CHF developed and/or improved interaction 
          between public and private sector entities throughout Poland. CHF actively 
          trained and enhanced the skills of private citizens, promoted new housing 
          finance mechanisms, promoted private sector initiatives and new approaches 
          to public-private partnerships, and laid the foundation for the organizations 
          assisted to operate independently in the future.</p>
        <p>Over eight years, CHF and local partners: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>directly assisted 1,651 families (or an estimated 6,604 beneficiaries) 
            responding to their desire to live in new, affordable, attractive 
            housing, 
          <li>facilitated over 400 mortgages, and 
          <li>leveraged over $39 million from private sources. 
        </ul>
        <p>These numbers represent not only physical results, but also the processes 
          that have remained in effect. These processes include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>better interaction between public and private sectors in addressing 
            constituents&#146; housing needs, 
          <li>increased capacity of indigenous non-governmental organizations 
            to serve to clients, and 
          <li>more efficient democratic decision-making processes, which allow 
            for greater civic input, more succinct organization, and better management 
            of available financial and human resources. 
        </ul>
        <p>In 1998, the project has been recognized by the Dubai International 
          Award for Best Practices and is included in the United Nations Center 
          for Human Settlement (Habitat)&#146;s database, accessible via the internet: 
          <a href="/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.bestpractices.org">http://www.bestpractices.org</a>.</p>
        <p>This report primarily reflects activities implemented between October 
          1996 and December 1999, under USAID Cooperative Agreement <i>Strengthening 
          a Decentralized Market-Oriented Housing Delivery System Through NGOs</i>. 
          Five discrete program components were implemented, providing mutual 
          reinforcement and contributing to the overall success of the program. 
        </p>
        <p>Under Component 1, &quot;<i>Center for Housing Initiatives</i>,&quot; 
          CHF helped establish, equip, and train a nationwide non-governmental 
          housing foundation, seated in Warsaw. The <i>Center for Housing Initiatives 
          (or CIM, its Polish acronym</i>) carries on CHF&#146;s mission to promote 
          the best practices, standards, and innovative approaches developed over 
          the past decade. CIM serves as the C<i>enter of Excellence, </i>sharing 
          information and popularizing approaches and mechanisms that adapt the 
          Polish housing system to a market economy. </p>
        <p>Affordability issues and improved access to housing finance are CIM&#146;s 
          special focus areas. It has developed a library of educational materials 
          and analytical tools, including those under USAID-sponsored activities 
          in Poland, and an interactive electronic system (KISIM), capable of 
          providing information on available housing finance, real estate available 
          for development, local builders, prices, and development conditions.</p>
        <p>Under Component 2, &quot;<i>Partner Cities</i>&quot;, CHF focused on 
          assisting local governments to enable private entities in the delivery 
          of housing through a network of non-governmental service organizations, 
          <i>AWIMs (Agencies to Support Housing Initiatives)</i>. Over the project 
          period, CHF established 25 AWIMs across the country (in addition to 
          10 established earlier). The success and speed with which CHF replicated 
          these organizations validate the underlying project assumption, that 
          non-governmental organizations can play a significant role as local 
          facilitators and promoters of public-private partnerships. The combined 
          results of AWIM-assisted initiatives are impressive. These include a 
          nationwide AWIM-network that has already facilitated nearly 2,000 new 
          affordable housing units financed from private sources.</p>
        <p>CHF developed a much-needed urban revitalization methodology model, 
          successfully tested in the cities of Bielsko-Biala and Klodzko (Component 
          4 <i>&quot;Revitalization of Bielsko-Biala Old Town&quot;</i>, and 5 
          <i>&quot;Post-Flood Assistance to Klodzko&quot;</i>). To help urban 
          citizens adapt to the new economic environment and the developing housing 
          market, CHF worked with local governments to design ways to manage available 
          financial, physical, and human resources in revitalization projects. 
          CHF and its partners looked for ways to preserve historic values in 
          the course of modern economic development, and to build effective response 
          mechanisms (in particular case of Klodzko, this involved mitigation 
          of the results of a disastrous flood of the summer of 1997). The underlying 
          principles of CHF&#146;s methodology model include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>involvement of community representatives in decision-making processes; 
          <li>integration of revitalization projects into an overall strategy 
            of development; 
          <li>use of strategic partnerships in funding; 
          <li>building public support for revitalization projects through the 
            active involvement of the entire community. 
        </ul>
        <p>To reinforce this new methodology, CHF organized four study tours to 
          the United States (Component 3 <i>&quot;Study Tours to the United States</i>&quot;). 
          Forty participants represented local governments, community non-governmental 
          and civic organizations, and community leaders of eight Polish cities. 
          Upon return, these participants became veritable &quot;change agents&quot; 
          in their respective communities. They facilitated decisions regarding 
          new use of historic structures, and the developed joint plans with two 
          neighboring cities to promote tourist attractions. </p>
        <p>The experience of CHF and its partners was widely shared with other 
          Polish cities and international audiences through workshops, seminars, 
          and discussion meetings. As an indirect result of stimulated public 
          interest, a new Polish association, &quot;<i>Revitalization Forum,</i>&quot; 
          was established. At this time, the &quot;<i>Forum</i>&quot; counts over 
          25 founding and supporting members, including local governments and 
          individual professionals, historians, architects, economists, and community 
          leaders.</p>

          <li><b><a name="_Toc479070430">Overview</a> </b></li>
        </ol>
        <p>CHF has institutionalized its activities in Poland by establishing 
          the Center for Housing Initiatives (<i>Centrum Inicjatyw Mieszkaniowych 
          or CIM). </i>Registered as a foundation, and operating on the basis 
          of a statute approved by the court, CIM serves as an NGO support center. 
          CIM provides technical support, troubleshooting, and consulting services 
          to the CHF formed network of Agencies to Support Housing Initiatives 
          (<i>AWIMs)</i>, local governments <i>(gminas),</i> and other local partners. 
          CIM&#146;s long-term goal is to become a Center of Excellence, disseminating 
          information about best practices and standards in housing, facilitating 
          exchange of information, providing training, ensuring quality assistance 
          and offering other needed services for housing practitioners.</p>
        <p>Since its formation in 1997, CHF has assisted CIM to refine its mission, 
          design internal operational and quality control systems, and improve 
          the skills of its staff. CHF and CIM staff carefully studied affordable 
          housing issues and examined ways to increase access to housing finance 
          in the context of the current Polish economy. </p>
        <p>January 1, 2000, marked the completion of CHF&#146;s active assistance 
          under this project. CIM now operates in a fully independent manner, 
          both institutionally and financially. Through CIM, CHF has successfully 
          achieved the goal of assisting and accelerating the shift of responsibility 
          for housing delivery from a centralized government to the private sector. 
          As mentioned, CIM will continue to serve as a Center of Excellence to 
          further this movement to decentralized housing delivery. Summaries of 
          CIM&#146;s current programs and its achievements to date are outlined 
          in the following sections of this report as well as institutional and 
          business development aspects, relations with other housing organizations 
          in Poland, CIM&#146;s organizational strengths, and other factors influencing 
          CIM&#146;s future viability.</p>
        <p>CHF implemented the activities under this project component (Center 
          for Housing Initiatives) in response to the following USAID-Poland Strategic 
          Objectives and related Intermediate Results:</p>
        <p><i>SO 1.3 Private sector development stimulated at the firm level</i></p>
        <p><i>IR: 2.0 Improved profitability of small and medium enterprises</i></p>

        </ol>
        <p>In order to assess CIM&#146;s viability as a fledgling non-governmental 
          organization, the following factors were considered:</p>
        <p><i><u>Institutional Development </u></i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Current organizational/legal status (internal management structure; 
            status of registration as a Polish institution); 
          <li>Operation (office organization/ adequate office space); 
          <li>Human resources (number of employees, their professional characteristics, 
            and how they relate to the organization&#146;s goals and mission). 
        </ul>
        <p><i><u>Business Development</u></i> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Business Plan /Strategy development (whether or not prepared, when, 
            by whom); 
          <li>Program Areas (how they fit current needs of the Polish housing 
            sector; implementation of pilot project to build a successful track 
            record); 
          <li>Finance /Budget development (current status). 
        </ul>
        <p><i><u>Relations with Other Organizations</u></i> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relations with Housing Sector Organizations (including those acting 
            at central and local level); 
          <li>Relations with Local Governments 
          <li>Relations with AWIM Network (agreements between CIM and AWIMs) 
        </ul>
        <p>The next sections provide further details and comments concerning each 
          of these factors. </p>

        </ol>
        <p>The formation of CIM as a Polish institution has been completed. As 
          of December 31, 1999, CIM is governed by the Foundation Council composed 
          of 5 members. The Council meets at least twice a year to provide overall 
          guidance in support of the Foundation&#146;s goals. As of March 2000, 
          the Council consists entirely of Polish nationals. A proposal was made 
          during the last meeting of the Council to form an Advisory Committee, 
          to be composed of highly regarded Polish professionals and practitioners. 
          The committee will provide additional advice and help promote CIM and 
          its programs at the national level. Once approved by the Foundation 
          Council, the Advisory Committee will help strengthen CIM&#146;s outreach 
          and build relations with other housing sector organizations.</p>
        <p>The management and operation of CIM are entrusted to the Foundation 
          President and Vice President, both of whom assumed positions in December 
          1998. Both have proved themselves highly effective in building CIM&#146;s 
          institutional capacity, as well as relations with other organizations 
          in the field.</p>
        <p>CIM employs a small number of employees, and expands its professional 
          capability through strategic collaboration with other housing sector 
          organizations. Together, the CIM team includes highly respected senior 
          and junior level professionals with experience in local government, 
          housing (including planning, housing finance, construction, and management), 
          cooperative development, institutional development, and capacity building/training.</p>
        <p>CIM is currently located in Warsaw, Poland and is fully equipped and 
          operational. Information about CIM and its activities is publicized 
          through monthly newsletters, CIM&#146;s web site: <a href="/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.cim.org.pl/">http://www.cim.org.pl</a>, 
          and through the KISIM electronic database (access in coordination with 
          and through CIM). </p>

        </ol>
        <p>With CHF&#146;s assistance, CIM developed an extensive Business Strategy 
          Document (<i>Business Strategy to Achieve Sustainability, July 1999,</i> 
          separately submitted to USAID-Poland). This document identifies CIM&#146;s 
          organizational strengths, areas of programmatic and business activities, 
          as well as financial and human resources needed to implement the programs. 
        </p>
        <p>The following are CIM&#146;s areas of programmatic activity: </p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CIM is well equipped to promote best practices, standards and innovative 
          approaches developed within the past decade, including those under USAID-sponsored 
          activities in Poland. As the <i>Center of Excellence, </i>CIM will share 
          information, sponsor and deliver training sessions and other activities 
          to popularize approaches and mechanisms, which adapt Polish housing 
          system to the market economy. CIM has developed a library of educational 
          and analytic materials, accessible to all interested organizations and 
          individuals. The KISIM electronic database, developed and administered 
          by CIM, is capable of providing information on available housing finance, 
          real estate available for development, local builders, prices, and development 
          conditions. CIM is also ready to provide referral services and share 
          practical experience accumulated through technical assistance programs 
          and participation in the implementation of a variety of housing programs. 
        </p>
        <p>Conforming to CIM&#146;s organizational mission, housing affordability 
          is the focus of its programmatic attention. CIM aspires to become the 
          central institution in Poland to tackle affordability issues and to 
          promote, popularize, and support initiatives, which make housing more 
          affordable to citizens. </p>

        <p>As a foundation established under Polish legal system, CIM cannot, 
          by itself, engage in commercial activities. However, CIM can and does 
          act through collaborative agreements with the 30 AWIMs across Poland. 
          In particular, CIM is a founder of AWIM-Centrum, a limited liability 
          company, which actively assists various housing development projects 
          in the Warsaw area. </p>

        <p>CIM has assisted several gminas in the development of housing policy

          non-governmental organizations under grants from Local Government Partnership 
          Program (LGPP) sponsored by USAID. Through this work, CIM is strengthening 
          its institutional relations with local governments and actively promoting 
          strategic planning, affordability, and high quality standards in housing.

          with housing finance mechanisms available for these types of projects 
          but at the same time introduces an added element of involvement of private 
          sector institutions. CIM will share its practical experience of the 
          pilot with other housing organizations and individuals. </p>

        <p>Through collaboration with CHF under a separate USAID-funded project, 
          C<i>ooperative Development Project (</i>or <i>CDP)</i><sup> </sup><i>,</i> 
          CIM developed a thorough understanding and gained practical exposure 
          to condominium development issues in Poland.</p>
        <p>Under CDP, CHF has been working in three focus countries, Poland, Philippines, 
          and South Africa, to increase the availability of affordable housing 
          services to under served populations through the promotion and strengthening 
          of cooperative housing systems. While the institutional arrangements 
          vary from country to country, the program strategy is to establish sustainable 
          systems by building the institutional capacity of CHF&#146;s local partners 
          to provide technical and financial services to indigenous housing cooperatives, 
          condominium, and homeowner associations. In Poland, CDP assisted condominium 
          development through training and pilot rehab projects to demonstrate 
          replicable methods and best practices to promote improvements in management, 
          repair, and renovations for other condominium associations and coops. 
          CHF has institutionalized these processes and procedures through CIM.</p>
        <p>This relatively new area, including real estate planning and management, 
          provides another opportunity for CIM and its collaborating partner organizations 
          (in particular, with the Polish bank BGK which provides financing for 
          condo renovation activities nationwide). A set of educational tools 
          was developed (including manual, training and skills development curricula) 
          to continue providing assistance and build relations in this area. A 
          detailed study was also prepared, focusing on loan monitoring systems 
          used by various financial institutions in the United States, and the 
          opportunities for adaptation of these systems to the conditions in Poland. 
          CIM has initiated relations in this regard with BGK bank, and plans 
          to continue this work in the future. </p>

          preservation and adaptation of community development to the requirements 
          of market economy are involved. CIM has established in this regard a

        <p>CIM has conducted a significant number of training programs for AWIMs, 
          <i>gminas</i>, and condominium owners. The experience gained in organizing, 
          marketing, and conducting these training programs, well positions CIM 
          to conduct housing-related programs nationwide on a fee or cost-reimbursement 
          basis. CIM has also conducted conferences for nationwide audiences. 
          The experience and materials developed by CIM is a body of information 
          that translates well into a number of different training programs for 
          varied government, <i>gmina</i>, and private sector groups.</p>
        <p>The wide variety of program areas in which CIM has been involved reflects 
          the variety of needs among the Polish housing sector during the transition 
          to a market economy, as well as the numerous opportunities for CIM to 
          provide assistance to partner organizations and individuals. Given its 
          current staffing size, CIM has opted to utilize a variety of collaborative 
          mechanisms to address the growing needs of the Polish housing sector 
          including building working relations and teamwork with partners (for 
          profit and non-profit housing organizations, consulting firms, and educational 
          institutions). </p>

        <p>As a Polish foundation, CIM must conform to regulations on fiscal management 
          applicable to foundations. General oversight in these matters is within 
          the scope of competence of CIM&#146;s statutory bodies, including CIM 
          Council and Management Board. Annual budget of the organization, as 
          well as financial reports are presented by the Management Board to the 
          Council, for its approval (annually) and proper documents are filed 
          with fiscal and tax authorities.</p>
        <p>Since its creation in 1997, CIM has been receiving small donations 
          from private individuals and private institutions in support of its 
          statutory activities. CIM is currently working on developing a fundraising 
          strategy, and approaching potential corporate sponsors including Polish 
          and foreign technical assistance groups. </p>
        <p>Through its relationship with AWIM-Centrum (in existence since October 
          1999), CIM is also planning to mobilize private resources. </p>

          <li><a name="_Toc479070436"><b>Relations with Other Organizations</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>CIM has been successful in developing, or at the minimum, initiating 
          working relationships, with a significant number of organizations. Among 
          them:</p>
        <p><i>Gminas:</i></p>
        <p>In particular, those with which CIM worked on housing strategy, revitalization, 
          or TBS development. In March 1999, CIM organized and conducted a national 
          conference for <i>gminas</i> to familiarize them with CIM&#146;s programs 
          and opportunities it offers.</p>
        <p><i>AWIMs:</i></p>
        <p>To date, over 30 AWIMs operate on self-sustaining basis. These private 
          sector facilitating organizations, established and trained by CHF through 
          its USAID contracts, continue their relationship with CIM. At this time, 
          17 separate collaboration agreements have been negotiated by CIM and 
          individual AWIMs, with a more detailed scope of services provided by 
          CIM. In response to existing demand, CIM is planning to offer further 
          training to AWIMs and assist in the formation and development of new 
          AWIMs nationwide.</p>
        <p><i>Financial institutions/banks:</i></p>
        <p>To date, two collaboration agreements have been negotiated, by CIM. 
          One with BGK bank (<i>Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego) </i>in support of 
          social housing (TBS) development programs, and with GE Bank in support 
          of condominium renovation programs. </p>
        <p><i>National level housing institutions:</i></p>
        <p>CIM is developing its relationship with the Office of Housing and Urban 
          Development through regular informational contacts, as well as exploration 
          of opportunities for focused technical assistance and intervention programs.</p>
        <p><i>Non-governmental housing sector institutions:</i></p>
        <p>To date, CIM has worked with or developed a working relationship with 
          several Polish non-governmental housing organizations. Among them are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>FISE Foundation (<i>Foundation to Support Social and Economic Initiatives) 
            -</i> collaboration with regard to TBS development, 
          <li>KIN (<i>Krakow Real Estate Institute) </i>- collaboration on urban 
            revitalization issues, 
          <li>RF - Revitalization Forum Association (<i>Forum Rewitalizacji</i>) 
            - collaboration on urban revitalization issues, 
          <li>IREM/Polish Chapter, GESTOR (real estate management firm), Association 
            of Condominiums &quot;<i>Wspolnota Mieszkaniowa</i>&quot; - collaboration 
            in condominium development, 
          <li>REAS, ORGBUDIN (private firms) - collaboration in training, housing 
            policy development and implementation of programs. 
        </ul>
        <p><i>Foreign technical assistance organizations and foreign sponsors:</i></p>
        <p>Since its formation, CIM has worked alongside CHF in implementing USAID-sponsored 
          activities, including Local Government Partnership Program (LGPP). Other 
          organizations include <i>British Know How Fund</i> and Warsaw-based 
          <i>Cooperation Fund</i>. In the near future CIM plans to take advantage 
          of potential opportunities through <i>European Community</i> programs.

            Strengths and Weaknesses</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In sum, the following are CIM&#146;s strengths as a nascent Polish 
          non-governmental housing organization: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Successful track record, building on working collaboration with 
            CHF and its partner organizations, as well as CHF&#146;s experience 
            of implementation of USAID sponsored programs since 1992; 
          <li>Nationwide operational base through the network of local facilitating 
            agents or AWIMs collaboration agreements which link the network with 
            CIM; 
          <li>Established working relations with more than 36 local governments 
            (<i>gminas)</i> nationwide, in which CIM worked, assisted with implementation 
            of AWIM demonstration projects, or with implementation of other CHF-assisted 
            activities; 
          <li>Established relationships with a number of condominium associations 
            and their representative organizations; 
          <li>Established relationships with several banks, including collaboration 
            and/or brokerage agreements with two major banks involved in the housing 
            sector; 
          <li>Developed and operational KISIM system (electronic information system 
            which allows the sharing of information pertaining to the housing 
            sector); 
          <li>Developed and operational library, including materials produced 
            under USAID-sponsored activities in the housing sector in Poland; 
          <li>Considerable experience with organizing and implementing training 
            sessions, seminars, workshops, and conferences. 
        </ul>
        <p>Areas were CIM must focus to improve its capacity to offer housing 
          sector services on a larger scale: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Overly ambitious area of interest (even with the mission-endorsed 
            niche and focus on affordability issues CIM needs to further refine 
            activities given its available resources);</li>
          <li>Limited number of full time staff members;</li>
          <li>Limited experience in fundraising and funds mobilization 
            from corporate and other donors;</li>
          <li>Limited general knowledge of CIM&#146;s programs, 
            capabilities, and accomplishments to date.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In conclusion, it is CHF&#146;s strong belief that Center for Housing 
          Initiatives (CIM), is in an excellent position to continue to provide 
          an array of technical, informational, training, and troubleshooting 
          services related to issues being faced with respect to housing, both 
          at national and local levels. Collaboration agreements currently negotiated, 
          including the one with CHF, will undoubtedly help strengthen its institutional 
          capacity and widen the outreach and impact. In the future, CIM seems 
          capable of facilitating the process of sharing of Polish experience 
          with other Central and Eastern European countries in transition to market 
          economy.&nbsp; </p>

        </ol>
        <p>CHF achieved the goal of strengthening market-oriented housing delivery 
          systems through non-governmental organizations in Poland. Starting with 
          two highly successful pilot projects (pilot phase, 1992&#150;1994), 
          CHF was able to replicate the program in over 30 locations by end of 
          1999. Today, as reflected on the map below, the so-called &quot;AWIM 
          Network&quot; reaches out to citizens throughout Poland. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>AWIM-Network as of December 1999</b></p>
        <p>In all, CHF helped establish and train 35 AWIMs. These housing facilitators 
          register and serve as non-governmental business organizations, collaborating 
          with local governments and private investors to organize and implement 
          housing projects, including those based on cooperative principles. In 
          two project periods alone (1994-1999), AWIMs: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>produced 1,140 new housing units 
          <li>facilitated 415 mortgages 
          <li>leveraged over $29 million dollars from private sources 
        </ul>
        <p>Adding the results achieved through CHF&#146;s pilot projects, the 
          total number of produced new units reaches 1,651 (or 6,604 beneficiaries, 
          counting 4 members per family), and $39,519,045 in funds leveraged from 
          private sources only. See Table I: Combined Physical Results of CHF/AWIM 
          Projects in Poland (1992-1999) in the Executive Summary of this report 
          for combined results that CHF achieved between 1992&#150;1999.</p>
        <p>The national CIM foundation supports AWIMs&#146; operations by providing 
          technical and organizational assistance, training, and troubleshooting. 
        </p>
        <p>CHF implemented the activities under the Partner Cities project component 
          in response to the following USAID-Poland Strategic Objectives and related 
          Intermediate Results:</p>
        <p><i>SO 2.3 Local Government is effective, responsive, and accountable</i></p>
        <p><i>IR: 2 Improved profitability of small and medium enterprises</i></p>

          <li><i>Customers paying for training and business support provided by 
            indigenous organizations</i> 
          <li><i>Sustainable business support services providing assistance to 
            SME investors in housing (including NGOs and small cooperatives) and 
            gminas</i> &nbsp;

            NGOs Assisting Housing Delivery</b></a> </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When CHF started its activities in Poland, the country had just begun 
          its transformation to a market economy, with high expectations as to 
          what democracy and the free market would bring. Despite overwhelming 
          public demand for improved housing, little private sector capacity existed 
          in Poland, and the state-dominated, deeply entrenched housing industry 
          was incapable of responding to the new demands of the free market. Newly 
          elected local governments were overwhelmed with their new responsibilities 
          and unsure of their role in promoting housing construction. In theory, 
          housing was to be provided in a new way, with local government increasingly 
          withdrawing from this sector, but the private sector was very weak, 
          with no organizations able to provide housing in accordance with free 
          market principles. In this context, and as a direct result of its demonstration 
          project implemented at two sites between1992&#150;1994, CHF introduced 
          AWIMs as non-governmental facilitators assisting local governments and 
          private investors. </p>
        <p>The challenges facing new housing construction projects focused on 
          finding the appropriate means of interaction between multiple partners, 
          on designing efficient and cost-effective mechanisms of producing housing 
          affordable to members, on developing efficient, transparent, and accountable 
          management systems applicable to a housing sector in transition. AWIMs 
          help meet the challenges involved. Working with the local governments, 
          the AWIMs identify communal or private land available for development, 
          work out appropriate land acquisition procedures, and coordinate infrastructure 
          development. With members of the cooperatives, AWIMs identify available 
          financial resources and plan the delivery process. Individual members&#146; 
          needs and preferences are considered as part of the overall project&#146;s 
          technical, financial and managerial objectives.</p>
        <p>The resulting model used a collaborative approach to form public-private 
          partnerships in which all participants (local government, cooperatives 
          and their members, contractors and financial institutions) were encouraged 
          to redefine and refine their roles with respect to housing delivery. 
          This practice has been recognized both at national and international 
          levels. Nationally, 32 municipalities have started refining the rules 
          and procedures for private housing development facilitated by non-governmental 
          technical service organizations. The changes prompted by CHF that had 
          to take place during this process, helped strengthen local governments&#146; 
          efforts to become more responsive to the communities&#146; needs and 
          preferences, and encouraged private sector engagement in the housing 
          sector (e.g. quicker acquisition and permit issuing procedures, inter-departmental 
          restructuring to improve coordination).</p>
        <p>On an international level, CHF&#146;s project was recognized as &quot;Best 
          Practice&quot; in 1998 by the Dubai International Award for Best Practices 
          and is included in the United Nations Center for Human Settlement (Habitat)&#146;s 
          database, accessible via the internet: <a href="/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.bestpractices.org/">http://www.bestpractices.org</a>. 
          This approach was also discussed with representatives of many Central 
          and Eastern European countries during the &quot;Practical Workshop on 
          Housing Privatization&quot; help in May-June 1999, in Krakow, Poland. 
          The workshop was co-sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission 
          for Europe (UN ECE), Polish Office of Housing and Urban Development 
          (HUDA), and CHF, and funding was provided by USAID. </p>
        <ol start="1" type="A">
          <li><a name="_Toc478966367"><b>Factors Influencing Success Rate</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Although AWIMs do not present a uniform group (to paraphrase,<i> &quot;not 
          all AWIMs are created equal...&quot;</i>) it is possible to enumerate 
          factors that influence the success of AWIMs as nascent local businesses. 
          It also may be possible to assess their individual future viability, 
          based on a number of pre-selected criteria, although involvement of 
          a number of factors&#151;over which CHF has no influence&#151;weakens 
          such assessment.</p>
        <p>Based on CHF&#146;s internal observations, the AWIM&#146;s overall 
          success rate depends on the following factors: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Time (length of operation as a business).</b> Barring unforeseen 
            circumstances, the longer an AWIM&#146;s time of operation, the better 
            its chance to develop into a vibrant local enterprise. Time allows 
            the AWIM management to perfect professional skills, and to implement 
            a pilot project, which starts the process of building an institutional 
            track record. The success of the latter is extremely important. A 
            desirable visible effect it produces serves as endorsement of AWIM&#146;s 
            operations, provides an easy to check point of reference, and attracts 
            future private investors. 
          <li><b>Strength of local economy. </b>This factor greatly impacts AWIMs&#146; 
            ability to attract clients. As of December 31, 1999, the strength 
            of local economy was not uniform across the country. Its weakness 
            may have forced AWIMs in several localities to suspend or cancel pilot 
            projects. 
          <li><b>Stability of local authorities. </b>Aside from the general state 
            of economy in the region, the level of support given by local authorities 
            is by far the most important factor according to AWIM directors. If 
            unable to develop a stable relationship due to personal changes, in-fighting 
            and political differences within the authorities, AWIMs find themselves 
            fighting a proverbial &quot;uphill battle.&quot; Examples mentioned 
            most often include: inability to reach a decision (any decision), 
            procrastination, need to start a relationship from zero level every 
            time local government team changes, inaccuracy or fallacy of information 
            made available, etc. 
          <li><b>Interpersonal skills of AWIM staff. </b>Ability to develop a 
            good relationship with cooperative members turned out in many cases 
            to be a &quot;make it or break it&quot; factor. Conflicts between 
            AWIM and cooperative were usually based in disagreement on operational 
            procedures (what to do and how to do it), or disagreement on financial 
            issues. 
        </ul>
        <ol start="1" type="A">
          <li value="2"><a name="_Toc478966368"><b>Criteria of Viability</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>A detailed analysis of individual AWIMs, evaluating their viability 
          as of December 31, 1999, as future businesses, was based on consideration 
          of the following criteria:</p>
        <p><i><u>Organizational structure</u></i> including current organizational/legal 
          status, number of employees;</p>
        <p><i><u>Business development status</u></i> including: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Status of Implementation of Pilot project (</i>whether completed, 
            under construction or under development/preparation; total number 
            of units produced); 
          <li><i>Total value represented by pilot project, including infrastructure 
            work (</i>to indicate how much business an AWIM can handle, since 
            the higher the value, the more extensive AWIM&#146;s experience and 
            the better its chances to manage successful projects in the future); 
          <li><i>Expansion to new sites (</i>such expansion usually reflects active 
            search for new business opportunities, whether in the same or other 
            localities); 
          <li><i>Housing finance and number of mortgage credits facilitated (</i>these 
            usually indicate the level of AWIM&#146;s understanding of the new 
            system of housing finance); 
          <li><i>New activity areas </i>(similarly to expansion to new sites, 
            new activity areas usually indicate AWIM&#146;s flexibility and willingness 
            to expand; new activity areas may include social housing societies/ 
            TBS&#146;s, property management, credit brokering, urban revitalization 
            projects); 
          <li><i>Staff development and additional training </i>(interest on the 
            part of AWIM staff in<i> </i>seeking opportunities for further training 
            usually indicates openness to new ideas, willingness to learn, and 
            flexibility in shaping business activity). 
        </ul>
        <p><i><u>Relations with Local Government</u></i></p>
        <p>To be viable, AWIMs must be able to build a working relationship with 
          local government authorities. The following factors were considered: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Overall attitude of local government towards AWIM</i> (usually, 
            the more supportive the attitude towards AWIM, the better chance it 
            has to develop into a successful local enterprise); 
          <li><i>Financial assistance to AWIM and its project</i> (again, local 
            government&#146;s willingness to provide support usually reflects 
            its view of housing as a priority, and indicates the level of engagement 
            into infrastructure financing and development). 
        </ul>
        <p><i><u>Relations with cooperative members</u></i></p>
        <p>This criterion determines the AWIM&#146;s ability to build successful 
          interpersonal relations.</p>
        <p><i><u>Relations with CIM</u></i></p>
        <p>The level of integration into the AWIM &quot;network,&quot; AWIM&#146;s 
          relations with CIM (as evidenced by existence of an agreement with CIM),

        </ol>
        <p>In order to assess individual AWIMs, CHF reviewed their current condition 
          (as of December 31, 1999) and future development plans. The results 
          of that review are presented below. Two general qualifications should 
          be made: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Ten &quot;oldest&quot; and most experienced AWIMs 
            operate on local markets since 1994. Given their high rate of success, 
            one can assume that AWIMs established in later program periods will 
            achieve their full potential only within the next few years. </li>
          <li>As previously indicated, the strength of local /regional 
            economy is an extremely important factor which has, in effect, impacted 
            specific AWIMs in a negative way, in spite of personal efforts on 
            the part of AWIM staff. While successful AWIMs continue to work within 
            the same locality, or even expand to different geographic and professional 
            areas, several AWIMs were forced to suspend operations or cancel pilot 
            projects. If conditions change, however, they may yet resume operations 
            and prove equally successful as other ones. Therefore, assessment 
            indicating low viability level must be seen in the context of conditions 
            existing <i>as of December 31, 1999.</i> Once these conditions change, 
            the foundations for successful development in the future are already 
            in place.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, the AWIMs have been very successful. Out of 35 AWIMs established 
          over the combined project periods, 17 are active today, and in excellent 
          condition. All currently operate on a self-sustaining basis, with fees 
          for their services paid by customers: <i>gminas</i>, small and medium-size 
          investors (including housing cooperatives), and individuals. Acting 
          as sustainable business support service agencies, the AWIMs organize 
          new projects and help families realize, as said in Poland, the dream 
          of one&#146;s &quot;own&quot; home.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>In all, AWIMs established in 1994 produced and/or are facilitating 
          a total of 573 new housing units.* New homeowners include local private 
          entrepreneurs, academic teachers, policemen, professionals, doctors,

          of the city&#146;s Housing Stock Management Authority/ZGM (1996-1997), 
          assessment of needs of local condominiums (1998), and assistance in 
          organization of historic downtown revitalization project (1997-1998). 
          To date, the AWIM produced 60 new homes and managed projects of total 
          estimated value of $1,668,167. Another 64 homes are currently under 
          development.</p>

          <li>First project, with Cooperative &quot;Bielsko-Biala 1/Straconka.&quot; 
            14 new housing units were developed, including 1 single-family, 1 
            duplex , and 11 row houses. Project was completed in Oct.1996. Local 
            authorities did not contribute to site infrastructure development 
            (all costs were borne by cooperative members). Total value of project 
            managed by AWIM: $313,420. Six mortgage credits were facilitated,

            are advanced to 1<sup>st</sup> floor). Local authorities (gmina) do 
            not contribute to site infrastructure development (all costs are borne 
            by cooperative members). Total value of project managed by AWIM: $1,779,601.

        <p><b><i>AWIM- Cieszyn, Director Ms. Barbara Mulawka</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Cieszyn started activities during the 1994-1995 construction season, 
          assisting a small local cooperative &quot;Demo.&quot; However, work 
          did not progress far. The AWIM director was unable to establish a working 
          relationship with cooperative members or local authorities. Difficulties 
          were augmented by the fact that <i>gmina</i> was unable to contribute 
          to site infrastructure development, driving up the development&#146;s 
          per-unit cost. This AWIM discontinued implementation of projects and 
          does not seem to be a viable venture at this time.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM-Gdynia, Director Ms. Barbara Kowalska</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM was established in 1994. Its director seems to be quite successful 
          in shaping the relationship with local clientele and local government 
          authorities. Beyond cooperative development projects, other activities 
          attract its attention. These include in particular: TBS development 
          (rental housing), and TBS development with involvement of private capital, 
          condominium management, and credit brokerage. </p>
        <p>In sequence: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>With cooperative &quot;Dabrowa&quot;. 
            Completed development of 27 homes (single family and row houses). 
            Four mortgage credits were facilitated. Estimated total value of managed 
            project: $625,000.</li>
          <li>With city of Gdynia. Two TBS projects (multifamily buildings, 60 
            + 70 = 130 units). AWIM prepared credit applications to BGK bank for 
            both of these projects and is currently awaiting final decision on 
            financing and implementation. Three more sites are under consideration 
            for similar new projects. </li>
          <li>With private developer &quot;Domator&quot;. AWIM continues to work 
            on TBS project, with involvement of private capital, even though various 
            difficulties were experienced. </li>
          <li>New housing development projects (in Jurata and Jastarnia) are currently 
            prepared.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Hajnowka, Director Mr. Ryszard Szpilewicz</i></b></p>
        <p>While AWIM-Hajnowka started in 1994 with excellent support from local 
          authorities, difficulties developed between the AWIM and a housing cooperative 
          that did not want to follow the AWIM&#146;s advice. In time, the cooperative 
          revoked its contract with the AWIM and proceeded development without 
          the AWIM&#146;s assistance. Given the relatively weak local economy 
          and other unusual circumstances, AWIM-Hajnowka was unable to continue 
          the organization and implementation of projects. On the other hand, 
          the local cooperative has continued with project development.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Jastrzebie Zdroj, Director Ms. Maria Kepka</i></b> </p>
        <p>From the beginning, city authorities have been extremely helpful in 
          supporting AWIM-Jastrzebie Zdroj. The region, however, has continued 
          to suffer greatly from difficulties experienced by the mining industry, 
          which is dominant in this area. Three different locations were identified 
          for new housing projects. The sites were able to accommodate single 
          family and row houses. A social housing (TBS) project, in which AWIM 
          could play a part, was discussed. At the same time, various difficulties 
          continued to be experienced, including a rather serious conflict between 
          the AWIM, co-op members, and the contractor. To its credit, this AWIM 
          turned to CIM for troubleshooting assistance and advice several times, 
          and steps to overcome the problems have been discussed. </p>
        <p>Even in the difficult condition of the region&#146;s economy, AWIM-Jastrzebie 
          has a fair chance of developing further. It certainly persists in its 
          efforts which (at the minimum) reflects a strong will of the AWIM-director 
          to continue the development. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Nowy Dwor Mazowiecki, Director Mr. Marek Mieszanowski</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Nowy Dwor Mazowiecki was established in 1995, with a separate 
          grant from an American company, Bankers Trust, administered through 
          CHF. AWIM organized and managed the construction of 20 row houses and 
          utilities. As of December 1999, all work had been finished and the houses 
          had been sold to individual purchasers. Leaning towards a for-profit 
          development model, this AWIM purchased a new land lot in the neighboring 
          city of Zakroczym, and proceeds with the preparation of a new project.</p>
        <p>According to the AWIM director, relations with the gmina have been 
          proper. With an energetic, well-organized, and professionally well-prepared 
          director at the head, AWIM Nowy Dwor Mazowiecki is a viable enterprise, 
          with excellent development opportunities. It is an active supporting 
          member of CIM and the AWIM Network.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Rybnik, Director Ms. Roza Korbel</i></b></p>
        <p>In terms of number of units built to date, AWIM-Rybnik has been the 
          most productive of the AWIMs begun in 1994. A total of 124 homes were 
          completed as of December 31, 1999, and 50 more units are under development. 
          AWIM-Rybnik enjoys an excellent relationship with city authorities and 
          wide support among the local population. This favorable attitude and 
          collaborative spirit are supplemented by excellent managerial skills 
          of the AWIM director. New groups of cooperative members are organized, 
          and the AWIM director expects to build up to the limit of the currently 
          developed lot (which, according to plans, exceeds 200 units).</p>
        <p>In sequence: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Phase 1 of &quot;<i>Osiedle Wierzbowa</i>&quot; development began 
            in June 1996 and entailed construction of 51 units (15+8+14+5+6+3), 
            majority of them row-houses. Work was completed in October 1997; approximate 
            value of over $2 million.</li>
          <li>Phase 2 of development commenced in April 1997, with 42 units (19+10+12+1) 
            including 2 small multifamily buildings. Twelve mortgage credits were 
            taken at Powszechny Bank Kradytowy in Rybnik. Information as to total 
            project value not available at this time.</li>
          <li>Phase 3 (on-going) is expected to produce 32 units (12+11+9), both 
            in small multifamily buildings and row houses. Total expected value 
            not available at this time.</li>
          <li>In planning: with the city of Rybnik, AWIM explores several possible 
            development opportunities, including a conversion/re-adaptation project 
            to benefit local university (renovation and re-adaptation of XIXth 
            century complex of buildings located within the city limits).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During the past three years, this AWIM and the city of Rybnik have 
          hosted several groups of international guests and have shared their 
          experiences with other AWIMs in the AWIM network. Numerous USAID visitors 
          and participants of the international &quot;Practical Workshop on Housing 
          Privatization&quot; mentioned earlier (May 30-June 1, 1999, in Krakow) 
          have studied the AWIM-Rybnik site. Relations with CIM and the AWIM Network 
          continue to develop.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Szczecin</i></b></p>
        <p>In spite of an excellent start, AWIM-Szczecin did not develop in a 
          satisfactory manner and it is not active at this time. Its first (and 
          only) project was organized in 1996-1997 in the Bukowo neighborhood. 
          Twenty-one homes were completed, with almost all members applying for 
          mortgage financing at Powszechny Bank Kradytowy in Szczecin. </p>
        <p>Since mid-1997, several attempts were made to reorganize AWIM-Szczecin 
          and organize new projects. CIM was asked to assist in this effort, negotiating 
          an agreement with local Chamber of Commerce (<i>Polnocna Izba Gospodarcza</i>). 
          Unfortunately, these efforts failed. In 1999, AWIM-Szczecin did not 
          resume activities. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Zory, Director Ms. Regina Lappo</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Zory seems to be in excellent condition at this time. Since 1994, 
          its director has been able to advance organizational development, undertaking 
          a variety of projects. It has established and maintained solid relations 
          with city authorities and co-op members. AWIM-Zory expands into co-op 
          management, multifamily in-fill projects, mortgage counseling and brokerage.</p>

        <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
        <p>Out of the group of 10 AWIMs established and trained in 1994, seven 
          continue field activities today. In CHF&#146;s assessment, six show 
          excellent progress. One AWIM experiences difficulties related to the 
          condition of local economy. Three AWIMs are not in operation at this

        <p><b><i>AWIM Kutno, Director Mrs. Edyta Pyzanowska</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Kutno was managed together with the local TBS (Social Housing 
          Society), which may be the reason why internal conflicts have been experienced 
          since commencement of activities. Unstable local government and poor 
          condition of local economy have also contributed to the difficulties. 
          It is expected that in relatively near future TBS will prevail in closing 
          AWIM activities altogether. At the end of 1999, fourteen units were 
          in progress, with a total value of project estimated at $600,000. However, 
          because AWIM-Kutno has not followed the cooperative development model 
          as designed and tested through the CHF pilot project, implementation 
          progresses with variable speed and without uniform organizational and/or 
          managerial structure. (In particular, each of the development participants 
          negotiates a separate contract with a different contractor, thus prices 
          and conditions of implementation vary widely.)</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Lubliniec, Directors Mr. Tomasz Reska and Mr. Mariusz Jasak</i></b></p>
        <p>At the end of its second year, AWIM-Lublinies, managed by two young 
          professionals, boasts of 12 completed units and 10 units in progress. 
          The <i>gmina</i> contributed to the development of site infrastructure 
          (equivalent of $175,000). Combined value of projects managed by AWIM: 
          $352,651.</p>
        <p>This AWIM continues to be very active, diversifying into new geographic 
          areas. Given that it was able to develop a good relationship with local 
          authorities, and wants to continue working with the city, a variety 
          of housing projects are being considered, including a TBS (or rental 
          housing) project. Conditions of the local economy are difficult, however. 
          In spite of an excellent track record, it is not easy to match clients 
          with types of construction promoted by the<i> gmina</i>. Compromise 
          solutions have been sought. AWIM-Lubliniec is an active member of CIM 
          and the AWIM Network</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Ostroleka</i>, <i>Director Mr. W. Wojtkowski</i></b> </p>
        <p>At the time when AWIM-Ostroleka was established (1997), it seemed to 
          have an excellent chance of developing on local market. This AWIM quickly 
          organized a group of cooperative members and prepared development. Shortly 
          thereafter, however, an interpersonal conflict ensued. With time, the 
          cooperative revoked its technical assistance agreement with the AWIM 
          and proceeded with construction on its own.</p>
        <p>In spite of these difficulties AWIM-Ostroleka 
          actively tried to address other development needs and pursue options 
          appearing on local market. These included:</p>
        <ol>
		<li>&quot;Weatherization&quot; 
          projects (i.e. improvement of thermal condition of buildings). AWIM- 
          Ostroleka facilitated improvements in several multi-family buildings, 
          including one of 40 units, three buildings of 40 units each (total of 
          120 units), one building of 72 units, and one of 30 units. A total of 
          262 units were improved.</li>
        <li>Construction of garages: 
          20 units were built</li>
        <li>Infrastructure development: AWIM 
          organized a cooperative to develop infrastructure, featured in local 
          press as an innovative way to address local needs.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The AWIM-Ostroleka director has been recently elected Deputy Mayor 
          of Ostroleka. It may be difficult for him to combine his new duties 
          with duties of AWIM-director. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Ostrow Wielkopolski, Director Mr. Andrzej Wardenski</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Ostrow has been doing better than might have been expected, given 
          problems with local authorities experienced immediately following commencement 
          of activities. Working without the <i>gmina&#146;s</i> support, the 
          able and energetic AWIM organized a pilot cooperative project of 10 
          units, followed by two more projects of 12 and 9 units, respectively. 
        </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>With cooperative &quot;Nasz Dom,&quot; the AWIM organized development 
            of 10 row houses, completed in spring 1999. It facilitated 7 mortgage 
            credits valuing $125,000. The total estimated project value was $343,674.</li>
          <li>With cooperative &quot;Wspolny Dom,&quot; a multifamily building 
            with 12 units. Construction is in progress completion is expected 
            in April 2000. The AWIM facilitated nine mortgage credits with an 
            expected of value $125,000. The total estimated project value was 
            $326,106.</li>
          <li>With cooperative &quot;Pod Brzozami&quot;. 
            New project prepared, expected 9 row houses with approximate total 
            value of $491,500. Completion expected in July 2000. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>AWIM-Ostrow is an active supporting member of CIM and the AWIM Network. 
          It seems to be in excellent condition.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Oswiecim, Directors Jaroslaw Kwartnik and Jacek Kulawik</i></b></p>
        <p>This AWIM seems to be relatively less successful in small cooperative 
          development, even though construction progresses on 3 duplexes (6 units). 
          AWIM-directors continued to look for ways to build closer relationships 
          with the<i> gmina</i> as well as local developers. These relationships 
          resulted in collaboration of the AWIM-Oswiecim with a private developer 
          to finish construction of a multifamily building and finding clients 
          for its 27-units. </p>
        <p>Another area into which this AWIM has tried to expand is TBS development, 
          even though no specific project has resulted so far. AWIM-Oswiecim seems 
          to have a fair chance of developing into vibrant housing service provider 
          on local market. It is an active supporting member of CIM and the AWIM 
          Network</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Przemysl, Director Zbigniew Duszyk.</i></b></p>
        <p>Thanks in part to its extremely active director, AWIM-Przemysl has 
          developed very well. With a total of 40 new units already completed, 
          preparations are under way for new projects to be undertaken during 
          the upcoming seasons. </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Site at &quot;Siemiradzkiego Street&quot;. Multifamily building with 
            18 units already completed. 15 mortgage credits facilitated with estimated 
            value of $145,000. Total project value at $472,500.</li>
          <li>Site at &quot;Wegierska Street. Development of 22 row-houses already 
            completed. 16 mortgage credits facilitated with estimated value of 
            $555,000. Total project value at $1,200,000.</li>
          <li>Site at &quot;Wegierska-2 Street. Multi-family development of 20 
            units. Construction documentation completed, work in progress. Completion 
            expected in July 2000. Around fifteen mortgage credits expected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>AWIM-Przemysl is an active supporting member of CIM and member of the 
          AWIM Network. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Skoczow, Director Barbara Mulawka</i></b></p>
        <p>At this time, AWIM-Skoczow seems to have a small chance of becoming 
          a vibrant local enterprise.  A combination 
          of factors seems to impede its chances for future development, such 
          as a weak local economy and conflicts between the AWIM and cooperative. 
          Contacts between CIM and AWIM-Skoczow are sporadic, and no particular 
          interest seems to exist on the part of the AWIM in developing such a 
          linkage. Very little information is made available about work on a project 
          commenced in 1997, expected to yield 33 new units: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Phase 1 (in progress): 9 homes</li>
          <li>Phase 2 (in progress): 7 homes</li>
          <li>Phase 3 (in progress): 17 homes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Zamosc, Director Mr. Witold Nowacki</i></b></p>
        <p>With AWIM-Zamosc&#146;s assistance, a housing cooperative was established 
          in 1997. Unfortunately, internal conflict between the AWIM staff and 
          cooperative members made it impossible to continue, and implementation 
          of the project has been suspended. </p>
        <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
        <p>Of the group of 8 AWIMs established and trained in 1997, 3 continue 
          field activities. They have progressed to become viable local enterprises. 
          The remaining 5 AWIMs are not assessed as viable at this time, although 
          as mentioned earlier, the longer the AWIM remains in the business cycle, 
          the better its chances for development.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>Twelve AWIMs were established and trained as part of 1997/1998 training 
          cycle. At the end of 1999, seven are still active on local markets, 
          organizing new projects and/or expanding to other geographic areas.

        <p><b><i>AWIM Biale Blota, Director Lech Sowinski</i></b></p>
        <p>The future of AWIM-Biale Blota seems hard to predict at this time. 
          The director completed training and has continued with construction 
          on 9 units (single-family homes) but no new projects have been prepared 
          for future seasons.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Bydgoszcz, Director Dariusz Sloniecki</i></b></p>
        <p>The situation of AWIM-Bydgoszcz seems difficult at this time due to 
          numerous personal changes experienced within <i>gmina </i>authorities. 
          Because of a highly unstable environment, the AWIM Director could not 
          develop a successful relationship with the <i>gmina</i>. Several times 
          the director sought help with resolving conflict with the authorities. 
          (One example is that while prospective co-op members are moderate-income 
          earners and therefore project implementation must proceed in stages, 
          the city insisted that the co-op purchase an entire land lot, large 
          enough to accommodate 70 new housing units.) Very slow progress is reported, 
          and chances for developing into a vibrant local business are rather 
          hard to determine at this time. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Krakow, Directors Mr. Lechoslaw Grochowicz and Mr. Artur 
          Tokarz</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Krakow, on the other hand, seems to develop in an extremely dynamic 
          manner. In terms of the number of sites managed and units produced to 
          date, this certainly is a successful operation:</p>
        <p>In sequence:</p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Multifamily building at Radzikowskiego Street is currently advanced 
            above 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. Completion is expected in mid-2000, with 
            total of 54 units;</li>
          <li>Multifamily building at Kuznicy Kollatajowskiej Street, also advanced 
            above 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. Completion is expected in mid-2000, with 
            total of 51 units;</li>
          <li>Single-family homes at Orla Street expect to yield 10 unit; all in 
            progress with expected completion in spring 2000;</li>
          <li>Three more sites are currently prepared for new construction projects, 
            with land already purchased and/or prepared for construction (expected 
            60 units in multi-family building, 20 row houses, and 4 small multifamily 
            units).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>AWIM Krakow also proved successful in developing relations with city 
          authorities and other on-going projects, including LGPP effort sponsored 
          by USAID. Active supporting member of CIM and the AWIM Network, AWIM-Krakow 
          has an excellent chance to continue its development.</p>

        <p>Implementation of a small local project had to be suspended because 
          of the very poor state of the local economy (due to breakdown of the 
          local copper industry and a high level of unemployment). </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Namyslow, Director Ms. Joanna Kowalska</i></b></p>
        <p>Similarly to situation in Luban, as of December 1999, in spite of the 
          best efforts on the part of AWIM staff, a weak local economy did not 
          allow for implementation of larger initiatives. A small project of 8 
          single-family homes was in progress but chances of developing new projects 
          are small. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Olsztyn, Director Mr. Piotr Zapotoczny</i></b></p>
        <p>Dynamic and with good interpersonal skills, AWIM-Olsztyn&#146;s director 
          has proved his organizational and managerial ability through pilot project 
          construction. With 32 units, the building has been completed and occupied 
          since July 1999, and new projects are in planning. Using his contacts 
          with local agricultural university, AWIM considers building a hostel 
          for academic teachers, and a multifamily project in TBS (or Social Housing 
          Society) model.</p>
        <p>AWIM-Olsztyn is an active supporting member of CIM and the AWIM Network. 
          The chance for its further development seems excellent. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Piaseczno, Directors Mr. Maciej Ciechowski and Ms. Malgorzata 
          Krupa</i></b></p>
        <p><i>Gmina</i> authorities originally professed interest in assisting 
          AWIM development and in supporting new housing development. However, 
          land lot designated by the city for AWIM-assisted project turned out 
          to be zoned &quot;arable&quot; rather than &quot;residential,&quot; 
          and elaborate zoning changes were required before the project could 
          start. Negotiations with<i> gmina</i>, and overall relationship between 
          AWIM and <i>gmina</i> seem difficult. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Plock, Director Mr. Zbigniew Szklarz</i></b></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this effort does not seem viable at this time. A cooperative 
          has been formed in 1998 with the AWIM&#146;s assistance, and some planning 
          on a pilot project has been accomplished. However, a conflict arose 
          between the AWIM staff and newly-formed cooperative, and collaboration 
          contract with the AWIM has been canceled. No progress is visible at 
          this time, and chances of the AWIM&#146;s developing a different area 
          of expertise are relatively small. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Torun, Directors Ms Teresa Wrobel and Mr. Sylwester Wrobel</i></b></p>
        <p>A new cooperative was formed, and an offer to purchase land for the 
          AWIM-assisted project was made in 1998. However, a conflict between 
          the AWIM and the cooperative ensued, and no solution was found other 
          than resolution of contractual relationship between the two institutions. 
          Implementation of the pilot project was suspended. As of December 1999, 
          the AWIM was working on a new project (at the architectural concept 
          stage) but no new cooperative has been organized yet. AWIM is also trying 
          to expand the range of consulting services offered, to include housing 
          finance and other issues. AWIM-Torun is an active supporting member 
          of CIM and the AWIM Network.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Tarnow, Director Ms. Dorota Wielgus</i></b></p>
        <p>This AWIM has an excellent chance to continue development. Very close 
          and successful relationship was developed with city authorities, which 
          produced a lot of good publicity for both the city, and the AWIM. Projects 
          mostly involve multi-family construction but a small number of single-family 
          projects are also pursued.</p>
        <p>In sequence:</p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Site Nad Stawkiem #1was completed in 1999, with 36 units. Almost 
            all project participants took mortgage credit, facilitated by AWIM. 
            Project value equivalent to $312,500.</li>
          <li>Site Nad Stawkiem #2, similar in size and form to the first one, 
            will be fall of 2000, also with 36 units. Almost all project participants 
            take mortgage credit, facilitated by AWIM. Project value equivalent 
            to $312,500.</li>
          <li>Site Oaza, duplexes, currently in progress.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Active supporting member of CIM and the AWIM Network, AWIM-Tarnow seems 
          to be in excellent condition, boding well for the future.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Warszawa</i></b></p>
        <p>Assists Cooperative &quot;Zielona Laka,&quot; established in 1997. 
        </p>
        <p>Construction has been considerably advanced on 20 new units (row houses). 
          However, there were no further plans for development at the project&#146;s 
          end, making it impossible to determine future viability. </p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Ziebice, Director Mr. Waldemar Baranowski</i></b></p>
        <p>During 1998, AWIM-Ziebice helped to form a cooperative that purchased 
          a land lot capable to accommodate 21 new homes. However, the project 
          did not progress to implementation stage. Due to internal conflict, 
          the cooperative resolved its contract with the AWIM and decided to proceed 
          without its assistance. No new projects are currently under preparation. 
        </p>
        <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
        <p>Of the group of 12 AWIMs established and trained in 1998, 7 continue 
          field activities. In CHF&#146;s assessment, 4 are currently in excellent 
          condition and promise to continue to operate as viable, active local 
          enterprises. Three AWIMs are still active but due to weak local economies 
          may not have equally bright future ahead of them. Five are not considered 
          viable at this time.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>Nine AWIMs were established and commenced training as part of 1998/1999

        <p>The AWIM-Grojec pilot project was awaiting final approvals when the 
          CHF/Poland project ended. Commencement of construction (for a multifamily 
          building of 45 units) was planned for the spring of 2000. Relations 
          with local authorities were somewhat uneven, with periods of close collaboration 
          and high level of interest interchangeably with those of inactivity. 
          AWIM-Grojec seemed to have a fair chance of developing into a viable 
          business.</p>
        <p><b><i>AWIM Olsztynek, Director Mr. Slawomir Nieciecki</i></b></p>
        <p>AWIM-Olsztynek helped a group of residents to form a cooperative, but 
          was unsuccessful in building a positive ongoing relationship with its 
          members. Neither are the relations with local authorities without conflict, 
          which does not bode too well for the future of the AWIM. Several changes 
          of plans by the co-op forced decisions already issued by local authorities 
          to be re-negotiated, causing delays and additional conflicts. The AWIM 
          tried to act as intermediary and troubleshooter. It plans to commence 
          the project in spring 2000. It is impossible to predict, at this time, 
          whether the project and AWIM will succeed. </p>

          AWIMs and eagerly pursued new housing initiatives in collaboration with 
          the private sector. AWIM-Piotrkow is an active supporting member of 
          CIM and the Network. It has a fair chance of becoming a viable local 
          enterprise. </p>
        <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
        <p>Of the group of 10 AWIMs established and trained in 1999, 5 continue 
          field activities and 3 have a good chance to develop into viable local 
          businesses. Two AWIMs are not considered viable at this time.&nbsp;

        <ol start="1" type="I">
          <li><a name="_Ref479073889"><b>OVERVIEW</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>CHF organized four <b><i>Historic Preservation and Economic Development 
          Study Tours </i></b>between October 1996 and April 1998, with participants 
          representing eight Polish cities: Bielsko-Biala, Rybnik, Zamosc, Przemysl, 
          Plock, Sopot, Klodzko, and Ziebice. In each city, newly elected local 
          governments faced problems of historic city-centers needing restoration. 
          These needs required immediate attention at both policy and implementation 
          levels. The cities&#146; preservation issues included: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>lack of a generally accepted development strategy that would preserve 
            historic values while allowing for modern economic development (including 
            the requirements of modern technology), 
          <li>lack of financial planning for new restoration or preservation projects, 
          <li>inefficient procedures to change zoning regulations, and/or 
          <li>lack of methods to facilitate citizen input in the decision-making 
            processes. 
        </ul>
        <p>Faced with these problems, local governments were eager to learn from 
          the experience of other cities, including American cities operating 
          in a well-developed market economy. Participants sought positive examples 
          of historic revitalization and preservation. They exchanged ideas on 
          how to confront problems, and they found ways to adapt new ideas, where 
          appropriate, to conditions in Polish communities.</p>
        <p>A total of 40 senior housing officials and community leaders participated 
          in the study tours. CHF facilitated the selection of study tour participants 
          to ensure a cross-section of communities would be represented. The tours&#146; 
          participants represented the following institutions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elected officials (mayors and deputy mayors, members of city councils) 
          <li>Senior housing officials (heads of housing, municipal services/management 
            departments) and senior officers of city development offices 
          <li>Representatives of local chambers of commerce and trade organizations 
          <li>Representatives of local private businesses 
          <li>Representatives of local NGOs (art and culture associations, city&#146;s 
            historic associations) and church leaders 
          <li>Representatives of financial institutions (Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, 
            Bank PKO Bank Panstwowy, Bank PKO SA/local branch). 
        </ul>
        <p>CHF linked these participants to counterpart U.S. organizations and 
          conducted discussion groups and workshops. Judging by the results of 
          follow-up activities and the high degree of interest shown by U.S. hosting 
          organizations, the tours provided excellent re-enforcement for CHF&#146;s 
          methodology. </p>
        <p>CHF implemented the activities under the Study Tours project component 
          to fulfill the following USAID-Poland Strategic Objectives and achieve 
          these Intermediate Results:</p>
        <p><i>SO: 2.3: Local government is effective, responsive, and accountable</i></p>
        <p>IR: 2.2: Local governments create and expand mechanisms for citizens, 
          NGOs, and businesses&#146; input</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>3.1: Increased technical and managerial capacity</i></p>
          <p><i>3.2: Increased level of financial resources available for use</i></p>
          <p><i>4.0: Improved indigenous mechanisms for support to local government</i>&nbsp;</p>

          <li type="A" value="1"><a name="_Toc479070450"><b>Four Study Tours to 
            the United States</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Participants of each of the four CHF-conducted study tours followed 
          a stringent program for two weeks, visiting selected sites from: the 
          Washington, DC metropolitan area (including Georgetown in DC and Alexandria, 
          Virginia); historic cities in Maryland (Annapolis, Baltimore, Gaithersburg, 
          Ellicott City, Germantown, and Rockville); and historic cities in Pennsylvania 
          (Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Frankford). </p>
        <p>The agenda and focus of each study tour differed slightly, to ensure 
          that particular local interests were taken into account. Among the U.S. 
          hosting organizations were: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Historic Preservation Advisory Council, FEMA, HUD branches, 
            and other national level institutions, 
          <li>various city offices of each area, 
          <li>historic preservation organizations (such as Georgetown Heritage 
            Trust, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Historic Annapolis 
            Foundation, Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia), and 
          <li>a variety of community-support groups (including the Business Support 
            Center in Baltimore and the Avenue of the Arts in Philadelphia). 
        </ul>
        <p>CHF submitted detailed agendas and reports from each study tour to 
          USAID-Poland following each of the sessions. These documents are available 
          from CHF.</p>
        <p>Study Tours provided the participants with two types of opportunities. 
          First, the tours allowed participants to observe, discuss, and compare 
          urban development approaches in the U.S. and Poland. Second, the study 
          tour experiences provided a forum for discussion, where participants 
          examined the ways lessons learned in the United States could be applied 
          to their home communities.<span style="color:red"> </span>The tours 
          had a mobilizing effect on participants, who expressed themselves freely 
          and without constraints of a formal institutional framework. The majority 
          of Polish participants considered the U.S. experience extremely useful 
          and applicable. They expressed their eagerness<span style="color:red"> 
          </span>to continue to develop solutions to the most pressing urban revitalization 
          problems in their cities, building on the knowledge and experience gained 
          through the tours.</p>
        <p>Selected comments on major issues discussed in the course of all study 
          tours follow.</p>
        <p><i>Observation of &quot;Democracy in action&quot;</i></p>
        <p>The practical implications of democratic action participants observed 
          impressed them. They saw that in these communities, people take matters 
          in their own hands without waiting for others, seek mutually acceptable 
          solutions, and implement them. They felt this is what &quot;democracy 
          in action&quot; should mean. Rather than formulating complaints and 
          demands of action to be presented to local governments, residents bring 
          creative input and suggest solutions. Grass-roots activities are organized 
          and implemented at all community levels.</p>
        <p><i>The role local NGOs can play in supporting revitalization programs</i></p>
        <p>Participants were surprised by the number of non-governmental, non-profit 
          organizations (NGOs) operating in the United States, and by the range 
          of activities NGOs engage in to support local governments actions in 
          the U.S. Participants stressed that they had developed a greater understanding 
          of the role NGOs can play in solving community problems, particularly 
          when working hand in hand with local authorities. Elected representatives 
          said they wanted to involve existing organizations in their home communities 
          in all aspects of policy development and implementation.</p>
        <p><i>Need for more efficient organization of urban revitalization programs</i></p>
        <p>Study tour participants unanimously expressed that, after the study 
          tour, they better understood the need to organize urban revitalization 
          programs more efficiently, and how to address that need. They witnessed 
          practical examples of successful programs, uniting concerns for economic 
          development with concerns for preservation of community values, including 
          those of historic urban districts. They professed their individual and 
          institutional desires to work towards strategic planning in policy-making 
          and implementation, by prioritizing and facilitating more efficient 
          coordination of local activities and galvanizing active involvement 
          of all community sectors. They noted the need to develop closer relations 
          and encourage more active involvement of national- and local-level private<span style="color:red"> 
          </span>financial institutions.</p>
        <p><i>Building public support</i></p>
        <p>Participants clearly understood the need to develop mechanisms to build 
          public support for urban revitalization programs. Public support mechanisms 
          supplement the financial and human resources that local authorities 
          need to implement these time-consuming and expensive programs. These 
          support mechanisms also mobilize the community and ensure greater responsiveness 
          and accountability of local governments. </p>
        <p><i>Voluntary effort and recognition of donors</i></p>
        <p>Participants often commented on the need to involve volunteers from 
          the community. They noted that volunteers are drawn to further action 
          when the volunteers&#146; efforts are well organized and their time 
          is used efficiently. </p>

        <p>Upon return to Poland, each city engaged in follow-up activities. These 
          were later presented in the Summation conference of April 1998. Materials 
          of this session reflect a variety of concrete results achieved as immediate 
          result of participation in the program. As of conclusion of Component

        </ol>
        <p>The successful Study Tour program component has spurred Polish citizens 
          to establish a new Polish NGO focusing on urban revitalization issues. 
          The organization, called the Association: Revitalization Forum (<i>Stowarzyszenie: 
          Forum Rewitalizacji </i>or RF<i>)</i>, was established with CHF&#146;s 
          active support in May 1998. The Forum is an association of public organizations 
          and private individuals that acts as a discussion and support forum 
          promoting urban revitalization involvement. As of June 1998, RF had 
          16 founding members including <i>gminas</i>. The association was formally 
          registered in court and acts on the basis of its Statute. Throughout 
          1999, RF collaborated with CHF/Poland in the implementation of its activities. 
          Together, RF and CHF/Poland organized discussion workshops to popularize 
          post-flood technical assistance activities in the city and region of 
          Klodzko. (See separate <a name="_Toc475945753"></a>report on project

        </ol>
        <p>In the Urban Revitalization project component, CHF developed a much-needed 
          model for urban revitalization methodology, and helped apply it in two 
          Polish cities. In Bielsko-Biala (1996-1998), CHF helped form the Old 
          Town Revitalization Task Force to advise the city authorities on all 
          revitalization issues. The task force reflected a cross-section of the 
          community, including representatives of local government, businesses, 
          non-governmental organizations, and community leaders. The task force 
          worked throughout the project period, formulating policy positions and 
          guiding and overseeing all revitalization activities. CHF and community 
          members established an Office of Revitalization Manager (or <i>Operator</i>) 
          that helped organize, plan, and carry out all pertinent implementation 
          processes. </p>
        <p>CHF collaborated with the task force and the city to develop an overall 
          revitalization strategy, in conjunction with the city&#146;s new housing 
          strategy and policy documents. Financial studies, environmental studies, 
          and studies on the social aspects of planned revitalization programs 
          accompanied the policy documents. A detailed inventory of a selected 
          section of the Old Town was performed,. Two sample buildings were prepared 
          for sale or technical upgrade (rehabilitation), and offered to private 
          investors. The task force drafted and proposed a strategic financing 
          plan to the city authorities. </p>
        <p>The private-sector community development processes that were experienced, 
          and the practical results achieved by the partner city Bielsko-Biala 
          were then compared with those used by six other Polish cities that had 
          been simultaneously working on their own revitalization projects. This 
          comparison pinpointed the advantages of CHF&#146;s model. The Bielsko-Biala 
          experience was disseminated nationwide. Sample materials, studies, and 
          educational tools were included in <i>Manual for Gminas, Part II</i>: 
          (&quot;<i>Vademecum Rewitalizacji Danych Dzielnic Mieszkaniowych</i>&quot;), 
          published in the fall of 1998 and distributed to 300 local governments.</p>
        <p>CHF implemented the activities under this project component (&quot;Urban 
          Revitalization&quot;) to fulfill the following USAID-Poland Strategic 
          Objectives and achieve these Intermediate Results:</p>
        <p><i>SO 2.3 Local government is effective, responsive, and accountable</i></p>
        <p><i>IR: 2.2 Local governments create and expand mechanisms for citizens, 
          NGOs, and businesses&#146; input, </i></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>3.1 Increased technical and managerial capacity</i></p>
          <p><i>3.2 Increased level of financial resources available for use</i></p>
          <p><i>4.0 Improved indigenous mechanisms for support to local government</i>&nbsp;</p>

          <li><a name="_Toc479070455"><b>DETAILED PROJECT RESULTS</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Estimates show nearly 500 historic towns exist in Poland. Of that number, 
          165 are considered of extremely high cultural value, and UNESCO has 
          listed a few as monuments of international historic importance. The 
          majority of Polish cities have engaged in some type of urban revitalization 
          activities, but their diverse experience have rarely been studied in 
          a systematic manner. With the economic and political changes of the 
          1990&#146;s, residents became interested in adapting their historic 
          preservation activities to work within the new market-economy conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>The procedural model for organization and management of projects aiming 
          at revitalization of historic districts may be characterized as a complex 
          of methodology guidelines building on the experience of many Polish 
          cities, supplemented by international examples. In particular, international 
          examples included experience of French cities, American, and other European 
          cities. This report does not aim to present detailed elements of this 
          methodology. Rather, it is limited to a summary presentation of the 
          results of pilot project implemented in the city of Bielsko-Biala (Block 
          A), which provided practical context in which newly proposed approaches 
          could be applied and tested. </p>
        <ol start="1" type="A">
          <li><a name="_Toc479070456"><b>Inter-disciplinary Task Forces Formed 
            to Initiate and Coordinate Revitalization Activities</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Bielsko-Biala Task Force (later called the Lead Team) was formed 
          in November 1997. The team&#146;s composition reflected the city&#146;s 
          intention to include a number of local institutions and individuals 
          interested in Old Town matters and to ensure their input in each part 
          of revitalization efforts. The Lead Team included city hall and city 
          development office representatives, architecture and planning specialists, 
          historic preservation officers, local leaders (including representatives 
          of local business and arts&#146; groups, and US study tour participants), 
          outside experts (including CHF, KIN, ORBGUDIN), and members of other 
          Polish organizations. A city board resolution passed in February 1997 
          (see below) determined the Lead team&#146;s scope of activities to coordinate 
          revitalization activities in the Old Town Center. </p>
        <p>The Team functioned throughout the pilot project period, holding coordination 
          and discussion meetings, drafting policy documents and position papers, 
          ordering detailed studies and analyses considered necessary, and providing 
          guidance and oversight in all matters relating to Revitalization. In 
          language of the City Board Resolution, the Team&#146;s functions were: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Promote, initiate, consult, and coordinate all revitalization activities, 
            and to ensure collaboration in their planning and implementation,</li>
          <li>Prepare and present to the City Board all proposals of Resolutions 
            and Regulations necessary for implementation of Old Town revitalization 
            program,</li>
          <li>Formulate options and prepare recommendations as to the methods 
            of financing of repairs and rehabilitation projects for structures 
            located within Old Town District, and the manner of the Gmina&#146;s 
            participation in such financing,</li>
          <li>Initiate and prepare necessary studies in order to determine which 
            communal properties are to be selected for partial or complete renovation, 
            and for partial sale or sale without prior renovation;</li>
          <li>Determine the scope of activity, and principles of operation of 
            the Office of Revitalization Operator which will underline the whole 
            process of the revitalization project</li>
          <li>Provide oversight and necessary technical support to the Revitalization 
            Operator for the duration of the project.&#148;</li>

          Team&#146;s work. Three separate volumes reflect the extent and depth 
          of preparation in which the team engaged. Materials include a revitalization

        <ol>
          <li type="I">&nbsp;<a name="_Ref479073813"><b>Overview</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Klodzko city authorities were unprepared to deal with a severely damaging 
          flood that struck the city in the summer of 1997. Augmenting Klodzko&#146;s 
          difficulties, the flood damaged several historic districts, requiring 
          special attention and new private-sector approaches (organizational, 
          managerial, and financial) that were yet untested under market-economy 
          conditions. The authorities faced a multitude of problems, and realized 
          they needed to upgrade existing response mechanisms and/or institute 
          new ones. They sought help from CHF to organize more efficient restoration 
          processes.</p>
        <p>CHF started revitalization strategy activities in Klodzko in July 1998. 
          Following initial discussions with CHF advisors, the Klodzko City Board 
          decided that the pilot Sand Island Revitalization Project&#146;s first 
          goals were to achieve fast, visible results. These visible changes would 
          stimulate positive responses from community members and help attract 
          private investment capital. This capital would be required to carry 
          out revitalization efforts beyond the initial period funded by foreign 
          assistance organizations. The City Board concluded that: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The pilot project area should be restricted to the strategic central 
            portion of the Sand Island, 
          <li>Initial renovation activities should be focused on buildings listed 
            as National Historic Monuments, 
          <li>The city must achieve a sustainable revitalization process by attracting 
            private capital through privatization of city-owned buildings. 
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout the project period (July 1998&#150;December 31, 1999), CHF 
          collaborated with the City of Klodzko on several levels simultaneously 
          to successfully achieve the objectives listed above. This report provides 
          detailed results of activities undertaken with regard to organization, 
          implementation, and building public support.</p>
        <p>CHF implemented activities under this project component to fulfill 
          the following USAID objective:</p>
        <p><i>&quot;The project 
          will assist the city of Klodzko in assembling institutional, financial, 
          and human resources required for planning, designing and managing the 
          City of Klodzko revitalization program following the flood of July 1997<b>.&quot;</b></i>&nbsp; 
        </p>
        <ol start="2" type="I">
          <li><a name="_Toc479070465"><b>Summary of Project Results</b></a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Results to date prove that, as a direct result of the USAID-funded 
          CHF project, the City of Klodzko has developed a solid institutional 
          foundation for future work and a set of policy and implementation guidelines 
          which will direct redevelopment work for years to come. </p>
        <p>Klodzko&#146;s revitalization results to date include the following. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The city initiated implementation of specific development and revitalization 
            programs. In the Sand Island Area, this includes immediate, visible 
            &quot;successes&quot; in the sale of two of four properties prepared 
            for sale to investors. (The proceeds will fund the continued revitalization 
            process). 
          <li>Authorities have established an organizational and managerial structure, 
            with a track record of effective operations (<i>Office of the Revitalization 
            Manager or Operator)</i>, fully equipped and operational for one year. 
          <li>The city has developed an excellent &quot;track record&quot; of 
            mobilizing funds, and it plans to mobilize further resources to supplement 
            city budget funds (see details below). 
          <li>The city has developed (or initiated) institutional links with several 
            national- and/or regional-level agencies. Agencies have collaborated 
            on, and provided financial contributions to, selected development 
            activities, and they have expressed willingness to continue to do 
            so. 
        </ul>
        <p>To prepare for those major project results, the following milestones 
          were reached. (To understand the importance of each of the following 
          steps, one must consider the social and economic context of the project&#151;in 
          a new, democratic approach, private citizens were participating in collaborative 
          efforts with the government, and city officials were operating under 
          a market economy for the first time.) </p>
        <ul>
          <li>City authorities prepared a &quot;City of Klodzko Development Strategy 
            and Master Plan&quot; and presented it to the public. After much public 
            discourse, authorities adjusted and approved the plan. The strategic 
            plan identified &quot;priority problem areas&quot; from city authorities&#146; 
            and residents&#146; viewpoints, and formulated a &quot;staggered&quot; 
            approach to their solution. The revitalization project was not tackled 
            all at once, but approached stage by stage, in a methodical and efficient 
            manner, depending on available resources (<i>Strategia Rozwoju Miasta 
            Klodzka, </i>November 1999). 
          <li>The city also prepared, discussed, and approved a &quot;Revitalization 
            Strategy for the Sand Island Area.&quot; (Sand Island is part of the 
            historic City Center that suffered greatly as a result of the flood 
            of 1997. Revitalization became an integral part of the overall city 
            development strategy&#151;revitalization efforts intertwine with other 
            development initiatives (<i>Strategia Rewitalizacji Wyspy Piasek w 
            Klodzku</i>, November 1999). 
          <li>The city projected costs for its development programs, including 
            revitalization efforts. Authorities conducted a discussion with residents 
            on economic aspects of the development strategy and resources needed 
            to implement the development programs. (<i>Ocena skutkow ekonomicznych 
            miejscowego planu zagospodarowania przestrzennego. Klodzko &#150; 
            Wyspa Piasek, Listopad 1999).</i> 
          <li>City officials developed their understanding of the need to build 
            public support mechanisms among residents, by planning outreach and 
            promotion efforts for overall city development issues in general, 
            and revitalization projects in particular. 
          <li>Authorities planned support mechanisms&#151;including monitoring, 
            networking, and follow-up actions&#151;to ensure the city continues 
            its market-economy oriented revitalization efforts, maintaining forward 
            momentum and raising the interest level and support of the public. 
        </ul>
        <p>At the project&#146;s end in December 1999, CHF left in place a well-planned 
          and well-organized basis for future revitalization activities. The city 
          of Klodzko plans to continue market-oriented revitalization activities, 
          as outlined in the Strategy documents, well into the future.&nbsp; </p>

        </ol>
        <p>Before the Sand Island Revitalization Strategy could be prepared, planners 
          needed to decide its place within the overall context of Klodzko&#146;s 
          city development plans. Since no city development document existed, 
          the city first undertook the wide-reaching task of developing a &quot;City 
          of Klodzko Development Strategy Document.&quot; City authorities spearheaded 
          the work, with local and outside experts actively participating. (Experts 
          included CHF staff and invited professionals and community leaders.) 
          A coordinating body called the Lead Team (and its consultants) assisted 
          the City Council and the Board. The City Council approved the final 
          City of Klodzko Development Strategy Document in October-November 1999.</p>
        <p>The Strategy Document reflects project activities: studies, discussions, 
          and analyses pertaining to specific portions of the strategy. (CHF submitted 
          the full text&#151;in Polish&#151;to USAID-Poland as a project deliverable.) 
          A study on the anticipated social aspects of development and materials 
          from a July 1999 workshop are included. The workshop identified areas 
          needing major development and needing strategic implementation programs. 
          Workshop participants prioritized the needs for city authorities to 
          address. After an open discussion, all identified program areas and 
          projects were assigned points and subsequently &quot;voted on&quot; 
          by participants. The &quot;votes&quot; specific projects received thus 
          determined their placement on the list. Over 40 participants attended 
          the workshop, excluding immediate organizers and outside consultants.</p>

            Document</a> </b></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The overall context of this effort is of particular importance. The 
          flood of 1997 forced city authorities to discuss options and directions 
          of urban revitalization projects in general and the Sand Island area 
          in particular. Assisted by CHF, the city of Klodzko began this effort 
          in spring of 1998, using a variety of mechanisms to ensure endorsement 
          of the program by residents, and their support for it. Results of an 
          opinion poll (in July-August 1999) among Klodzko residents evidenced 
          that they have indeed endorsed the program. </p>
        <p>Organizers analyzed a public questionnaire to identify the most pressing 
          problem areas from city residents&#146; viewpoints. In sequence of importance, 
          these were: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Housing (identified by 80% of respondents)</li>
          <li>Employment generation and consequences of unemployment (79%)</li>
          <li>Development of flood-prevention systems (58%)</li>
          <li>Revitalization of the Sand Island historic area (51%)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Development of the Revitalization Strategy for Historic Sand Island 
          Area thus became fully integrated and inter-connected with preparation 
          of the overall City Development Strategy.</p>
        <p>To assess the residents&#146; expectations of Sand Island historic 
          area issues, organizers prepared an additional questionnaire. The results 
          (Attachment #2 to the Strategy Document) reflected Klodzko residents&#146; 
          opinions about the direction the revitalization effort should take, 
          the methods of privatization and financing the effort, and what type 
          of commercial or residential activities the historic buildings should 
          house.<sup> </sup>128 people took part in the poll. </p>
        <p>The Strategy Document for the revitalization of the Sand Island area 
          contains several sets of recommendations for simultaneous future work 
          on the following levels. </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Social Level </li>
        </ol>
        <p>On the social level, the strategy aims to develop public acceptance 
          for urban revitalization projects under the city authorities&#146; leadership. 
          It considers public relations and continuous communication with residents 
          essential for the project&#146;s success. The strategy re-affirms the 
          need to share information, keep communication open, and publicly discuss 
          issues&#151;as mechanisms to formulate innovative solutions and release 
          individual participants&#146; creativity. The strategy recommends a 
          variety of supporting events, informational materials, and opinion-sharing 
          devices to popularize long- and short-term goals and processes for revitalization. 
        </p>
        <p>Planners considered a national architectural design competition to 
          be an important part of building support for the revitalization project. 
          Contestants submitted renovation concepts for a central area of Sand 
          Island (a selected quarter outlined by certain streets). Planners presented 
          results of the competition to the city authorities. Authorities saw 
          the opportunities and potential of the project, and they secured funds 
          in the next fiscal year&#146;s city budget for the post-competition 
          technical documentation. Simultaneously, a local Museum organized a 
          public exposition, fostering discussion of the proposed development 
          of the Klodzko Region. </p>
        <p>Residents consider the openness and transparency of all social issues 
          regarding the revitalization project to be particularly beneficial. 
          The effects of transparent procedures mobilize city authorities that 
          feel themselves under constant scrutiny (&quot;on the spot&quot;). The 
          Revitalization Strategy Document recommends those information-sharing 
          mechanisms&#151;in regard to both positive and, if necessary negative 
          aspects of revitalization&#151;are continuously improved and refined. 
        </p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
          <li>Legal/ Procedural Level </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ownership structures within Sand Island historic area are the focus 
          of work at this level, with an objective of verification and clarification 
          of existing status of properties. </p>
        <p>At this time, in the historic Sand Island area, communal property dominates 
          (i.e. ownership by the gmina). The Strategy Document recommends continuation 
          of work already began at this level, and prioritizes activities on which 
          to concentrate in the near future. These include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>establishing individual cadastres for properties which do not have 
            them</li> 
          <li>clarification of legal status and settling of pre-existing claims 
            from time-period before the flood of 1977 </li>
          <li>settling of outstanding claims and disputes </li>
          <li>continuation of the dialogue with owners&#146; associations, and 
            determination of rights and duties </li>
          <li>developing a plan of city&#146;s assistance to resident associations </li>
          <li>finalizing the plan of geodetic sub-division of properties </li>
          <li>continuation of a review of properties to ensure conformity with 
            Building Codes regulations </li>
          <li>verification of the sizes of properties as registered in city documents 
            and those in individual decisions (including contracts, unilateral 
            decisions allowing to live in assigned quarters, etc.) </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3" type="1">
          <li>Technical Level</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Work at this level aims at preparation of the process of implementation 
          of specific projects, conforming to the needs of users while at the 
          same time preserving historic values it represents. </p>
        <p>To allow for systematic and well-organized implementation of goals, 
          the Strategy Document recommends that work already started continue, 
          including: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and discussion of the so-called &quot;List of Basic Problems 
            Experienced in the Sand Island Area&quot; (part of Strategy document)</li> 
          <li>Advanced historic architectural research and evaluation </li>
          <li>Commencement of work to strengthen and protect walls in 6 buildings 
            (with co-financing by Voivodship Historic Preservation Office and 
            the city) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Strategy also identifies areas of technical work to be done in 
          the upcoming phases: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preparation of technical documentation for structures which will 
            remain in the gmina&#146;s ownership, or in which the gmina has a 
            majority share </li>
          <li>Preparation of designs/plans for public areas, transportation lines, 
            parking places, public squares, and green areas, especially along 
            the river-banks </li>
          <li>Continuation of work with property and media owners to adjust engineering 
            and infrastructure network to approved plans </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Revitalization Strategy Document considers two technical problem 
          areas most important: uniform use of construction materials to minimize 
          potential flood-related losses, and introduction of changes in the city&#146;s 
          heating system (switching from coal furnaces to gas or electric heaters) 
          to improve air circulation in the whole Sand Island area. </p>
        <ol start="4" type="1">
          <li>Financial and resource mobilization level </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Strategy Document identifies four possible sources of funding of 
          future revitalization work: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>city budget </li>
          <li>credits taken by gmina </li>
          <li>municipal bonds </li>
          <li>funds leveraged /contributed by major stakeholders </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So far, the city of Klodzko relied on city budget, supplemented, to 
          a degree, by foreign assistance funds. However, CHF experts and Lead 
          team members assisted the city to apply for additional funding to several 
          central government agencies. This effort was particularly effective 
          in mobilizing funds for mitigation of post-flood damages, and in securing 
          the funding for the repairs of the flood damaged Nysa River embankments. 
          In September 1999, the City received substantial financial contribution 
          from the government flood relief fund. Equally successful were efforts 
          to secure funds from Voivodship Historic Preservation Office, building 
          on work commenced by CHF-assisted project and the momentum created through 
          this work. In total, over $520,000 was leveraged. </p>
        <p>With regard to financial management, the Revitalization Strategy Document 
          recommended: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The city budget needs to be re-structured in a project-oriented 
            way. 
          <li>Proceeds from the sale or lease, and proceeds from management of 
            communal properties located in Sand Island area, need to be re-applied 
            towards revitalization work in this area. The city authorities were 
            charged to stringently follow that rule. At the same time, a projection 
            made in support of this recommendation stipulated that within 2 years, 
            if done systematically, this would allow the city to amass enough 
            resources to fund further revitalization work. 
        </ul>
        <p>At the conclusion of CHF&#146;s Klodzko project, the city continued 
          to pursue privatization options. Following technical documentation and 
          advanced historic architectural research and evaluation, work was finalized 
          with regard to four buildings that were subsequently offered for public 
          sale. This exceeded CHF&#146;s contractual obligation to assist the 
          city in preparation of one building for sale or renovation, to serve 
          as a sample for future similar offers. As of December 1999, private 
          investors had purchased two of the four buildings offered for sale. 
          The funds from the sale will ensure continued revitalization activities 
          for the immediate future. </p>

        </ol>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>The Revitalization Lead Team, its Structure, Composition, 
            and Goals </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Lead Team was formed in summer 1998, with a specific purpose of 
          providing a united forum for all governmental and non-governmental institutions, 
          and individuals, willing to engage in overall post-flood reconstruction 
          effort. The leading force in the Team belonged to the City officers, 
          with elected City Mayor at the head. Other members of the Team represented 
          local government authorities (various City Departments, State and Regional 
          Agencies), and city leaders representing various existing citizen groups 
          and/or civic organizations. The latter included, for example, Chamber 
          of Commerce of the Klodzko Region, tenant associations, Museum of Klodzko 
          Region, representatives of Wroclaw Polytechnics, local press, designing 
          and architectural bureaus and/or architects, designers, and historic 
          preservation officers of various levels. During the whole project period, 
          Revitalization Lead Team met bi-weekly. In total, it held 27 meetings 
          (brief reports on its activities were provided). </p>
        <p>The main role of the Lead Team was to provide general guidance, serve 
          as discussion forum, and provide needed support and coordination for 
          all work and all project participants. Technical, financial, and implementation 
          issues were discussed from multiple points of view, with concerns brought 
          up in front of this multi-disciplinary body to be considered by specialists 
          and layperson alike. The City vice-mayor and members of the City Council 
          were regular participants of the Team meetings, providing a needed liaison 
          with the Mayor and her Office. In retrospect, work of the Revitalization 
          Lead Team proved to be very effective in helping the City establish 
          cross-institutional partnerships, and assisting the City in organization 
          of a uniform management structure of the whole revitalization process. 
          It was particularly successful in supporting the City&#146;s efforts 
          to attract outside funding for the revitalization program. Throughout 
          the period, individual Team members provided training and guidance to 
          the Revitalization Operator and selected City departments. </p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
          <li>Office of Revitalization Project Operator</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Office of Revitalization Project Coordinator (or &quot;Operator&quot;) 
          was established following the City&#146;s Resolution of September 1998, 
          with Mr. Mariusz Kud appointed the Sand Island Revitalization Project. 
          The Resolution approved draft Scope of work and Work Plan for 1999. 
          Starting in 1999, the Office was assisted by a local full time technical 
          assistant. </p>

        </ol>
        <p><a name="_Toc478896026"></a>For the duration of the project, CHF and 
          the Lead Team experts provided the Operator with training and support 
          in all of his tasks. This included, in particular, coordination of all 
          activities relating to the Sand Island Revitalization Project, and oversight 
          of technical work carried out in this area.</p>
        <p>Overall achievements in implementation area by the end of December 
          1999 include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advancement of historic architectural research and evaluation;</li> 
          <li>Completion of architectural and construction inventory of almost 
            all buildings in Sand Island area. Specifically: 47 buildings were 
            analyzed and Property Charts for each one of them were established; 
            charts (&quot;Karta posesji&quot;) contain basic information about 
            the structural characteristics </li>
          <li>Development of technical documentation for reconstruction of 5 buildings,</li> 
          <li>Preparation of a list of programmatic and technical priorities and 
            presentation to the City Board for approval (as part of City of Klodzko 
            Development Strategy Document), preparation of Revitalization project 
            budget proposal for fiscal year 2000; </li>
          <li>Preparation of the architectural competition for the selected area 
            of the Sand Island, especially in regard to gathering and selecting 
            appropriate documentation and </li>
          <li>Facilitation of the process of preparation of revitalization 
            strategy, working very closely with consultants and CHF experts with 
            regard to properties owned by the city, preparation of buildings for 
            privatization and coordination of privatization process. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In all tasks, the Lead Team experts assisted the Revitalization Manager. 
          In one example, the Lead Team experts provided the Manager with recommendations 
          for buildings located within the pilot project area, including: </p>
        <ol type="a">
		  <li>whether to prepare for immediate privatization of the entire building 
            (in case of communal buildings owned by the gmina), or </li>
          <li>whether to continue rehabilitation work with co-financing by the City 
            and local condominium members and with possible additional funding 
            from the Historic Preservation Office (in cases of condo-owned buildings 
            in which the gmina has a majority stake in the property). </li>

        <p>City Board and/or City Council members attended all Lead Team meetings. 
          The Lead Team briefed members on specific achievements of the Sand Island 
          revitalization project. Members discussed the project with the Team 
          and helped make decisions on key elements. The following is a list of 
          activities and/or events organized during the project to build general 
          support for and understanding of the Sand Island Revitalization project. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An informational flyer was published in August 1999 and widely distributed 
            within the local community in form of an insert to a local newspaper.</li> 
          <li>Local media representatives participated in all Leading Team meetings, 
            which resulted in several articles, radio stories, and TV programs. 
            The City Mayor&#146;s spokesperson now coordinates all media activities, 
            and directs the information campaign, with frequent reports to the 
            Lead Team. </li>
          <li>The Revitalization Manager, assisted by City Housing and Social 
            Department personnel, organized two meetings of City representatives 
            and Sand Island area tenants and owners. Officials informed participants 
            about the Revitalization Program, the progress of the Pilot Project, 
            and the legal and ownership status of units, buildings, and lots. 
            The city collected information regarding future plans of participants. 
            They planned individual meetings and negotiations with owners and 
            tenants. </li>
          <li>Public &quot;consultations&quot; were conducted with regard to general 
            expectations and desired directions of Revitalization work. Information 
            was gathered on residential preferences through detailed widely disseminated 
            questionnaires. </li>
          <li>Two Discussion Workshops were conducted (September 1998 and May 
            1999), serving as forums for general discussion of revitalization 
            problems and the ways in which the city should address them. The workshops 
            sought input from outside experts from other Polish cities, in particular 
            through collaboration with Revitalization Forum (Association whose 
            formation was facilitated by CHF under a separate program component). </li>
        </ul>

        <p><a name="_Toc479070473"><b>CONCLUSION</b></a></p>
        <p>The objective of the CHF project in Poland was to help democratic housing 
          cooperatives become an effective delivery system in a transitional economy. 
          The challenges facing the initiative focused on finding the appropriate 
          means of interaction between multiple project partners, on designing 
          efficient and cost-effective mechanisms of producing housing affordable 
          to members, on developing efficient, transparent, and accountable management 
          systems applicable to a housing sector in transition. </p>
        <p>Over eight years of its activities in Poland (1922-1999), CHF achieved 
          multi-faceted and impressive results:</p>
        <p><b><i>1</i>. <i>Quality of Life Improvements</i></b></p>
        <p>1,140 new housing units completed or substantially advanced at 33 sites, 
          with 4,560 individuals benefiting from the program (estimated 4 members 
          per family).</p>
        <p>The average cost of home construction is 20% lower than that statistically 
          estimated for the national level, while the basic development cycle 
          was reduced to only 2 years. The average usable space of each family 
          doubled from 60 to 120 square meters. In all, 1,140 families (or 4,560 
          beneficiaries) across Poland will have considerably improved their quality 
          of life.</p>
        <p><b><i>2. Local policy development</i></b></p>
        <p>32 municipalities have started refining the rules and procedures for 
          private housing development facilitated by non-governmental technical 
          service organizations. The changes prompted by CHF which had to take 
          place during the initiative, helped strengthen local governments&#146; 
          efforts to become more responsive to the communities&#146; needs and 
          preferences, and encouraged private sector engagement in the housing 
          sector (e.g. quicker acquisition and permit issuing procedures, inter-departmental 
          restructuring to improve coordination).</p>
        <p><b><i>3. Institutional Development</i></b></p>
        <p>The results are visible at two levels, local and national<i>:</i></p>
        <p><i>Local NGOs:</i> Based on the success of pilot communities, 32 NGOs 
          (AWIMs) have been established, many of them directed by professional 
          women. All AWIMs currently operate without any outside assistance. They 
          continue new development as private businesses operating on market principles, 
          performing tasks in a &quot;fee-for-service&quot; manner. Their main 
          focus: organizing, coordinating and implementing new projects, and facilitating 
          housing finance arrangements.</p>
        <p><i>Local Housing Cooperatives</i>:<b> </b>Project participants represent 
          a broad cross-section of communities including teachers, doctors, engineers, 
          clerks, and business owners. Organized into small, democratically run 
          housing cooperatives, 36 to date, they represent a strong grass-roots 
          force. Through this initiative, they strengthen their institutional 
          capabilities and their interest in civic participation and democratic 
          decision making processes.</p>
        <p><i>National Support Center (CIM):</i> The strong interest generated 
          by this initiative was an example of Poland&#146;s continuous search 
          for new, more efficient mechanisms of housing delivery. As a result 
          of this interest, CHF established a national informational and educational 
          support center (or CIM) to provide technical assistance and training, 
          as well as to institutionalize the linkages within the newly formed 
          AWIM network. The Center&#146;s mission is to become the national center 
          of excellence in affordable housing.</p>
        <p><b><i>4. Social Impact</i></b></p>
        <p>In addition, the CHF program has produced a social impact on the local 
          communities by helping change people&#146;s attitudes and behavior in 
          the following way: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobilization of local job markets through new construction, including 
            mechanisms which promote competition and cost-effectiveness (multi-family 
            rather than individual design, multiple bids, individually-tailored 
            design based on preferences and cost); and </li>
          <li>Realization that mortgage instruments can be successfully used to 
            augment resources currently available for housing development. The 
            majority of families participating in the initiative rely on mortgage 
            financing, reflecting its growing popularity as part of a modern, 
            market-oriented housing delivery system. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><i>5. Sustainability</i></b></p>
        <p>CHF initiatives have already changed the housing sector permanently 
          in the following ways:</p>
        <p><i>Public-Private Partnerships:</i> The public and private sectors 
          accept the partnership with NGOs assisting local residents, recognize 
          it as a means for more effective housing delivery, and are willing to 
          support private initiatives which fulfill the needs of the community.</p>
        <p><i>Citizen Empowerment</i>: Local community members enhance their capability 
          to engage local government in a dialogue on policy issues related to 
          meeting housing needs, and can influence the decision making process.</p>
        <p><i>Stronger Private Sector<b>:</b></i> The capacity of the private 
          sector is enhanced locally as well as nationally by streamlining and 
          strengthening the delivery process to be demand driven at every level. 
          Through self-sustainable NGOs which are responsive to the requirements 
          of small groups of private investors, and facilitate the development 
          process including the financial, organizational, and managerial aspects, 
          the AWIMs are able to tap into the resources of the middle class whose 
          housing needs have not been fulfilled.</p>
        <p><i>National Voice for Affordable Housing</i>: Institutionally, the 
          AWIMs&#146; efforts are reinforced through the national-level support 
          center, CIM, which aims to become a clearinghouse of information and 
          educational services to support all innovative housing initiatives.</p>
        <p><i>Resource Mobilization:<b> </b></i>CHF initiatives effectively maximized 
          the impact of foreign assistance funds provided through international 
          development organizations by leveraging the equivalent of $7.15 of local 
          (Polish) resources for affordable housing for each $1 coming from international 
          sources (average 1:7 ratio).</p>
        <p><b><i>6. Lessons Learned</i></b> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In economies in transition, new institutional arrangements such 
            as public-private partnerships working through NGOs, are needed to 
            liberate the energy of the private sector, revive entrepreneurial 
            spirit, and jump-start a previously failing housing sector; </li>
          <li>Early, successful demonstration projects significantly impact the 
            re-orientation of local shelter practices and policies (there is nothing 
            more persuasive than visible success and nothing more visible than 
            a new house); </li>
          <li>Demand driven NGOs, not bound by the restrictions of previous systems, 
            trained through a physical production process and using imaginative 
            approaches to develop housing in a timely and more cost-effective 
            manner, can lead others to a virtual explosion of activity and replication 
            of successful results; </li>
          <li>This initiative shows how to stimulate housing delivery at the local 
            level. This successful model may be replicate in Central Europe, Russia, 
            the NIS, and in other economies in transition. Evolving from two pilot 
            sites in 1992 to 32 sites across the country by 1998, this initiative 
            demonstrates that in partnership with local governments, NGOs can 
            play a significant role in facilitating private housing production 
            based on free market principles. These new NGOs help community members 
            to improve their quality of life by upgrading the living conditions 
            of their families. </li>
