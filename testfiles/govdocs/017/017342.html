<p align="center"><strong>SEA'S CONCLUSIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA has completed an extensive review of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) acquisition of a rail line owned by Mid-Michigan Railroad,
Inc., which operates the Northeast Kansas and Missouri Railroad (NEKM).  In its review, SEA
identified potential adverse impacts in only four issue areas (air quality, noise, freight rail operations
safety, and highway/rail at-grade crossing safety).  SEA believes that is has developed
comprehensive, reasonable, and practical environmental mitigation recommendations that address
all potential adverse environmental impacts in the four issue areas.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based on its extensive independent analysis of all of the available information, SEA concludes that
the proposed acquisition of the NEKM rail line segment by UP would not significantly affect the
quality of the human environment if the recommended mitigation measures set forth in this Final EA
are imposed and implemented.  Accordingly, SEA recommends that the Board impose the mitigation
measures listed in Chapter 4, "Recommended Environmental Conditions," as conditions in any final
decision approving the proposed Acquisition.

<p align="center"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Surface Transportation Board (the Board),  Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA), prepared
this Final Environmental Assessment (Final EA) to identify and evaluate the potential environmental
impacts of the acquisition by Union Pacific Railroad (UP) of a rail line between St. Joseph, Missouri
and Upland, Kansas from the Northeast Kansas and Missouri Railroad (NEKM), a subsidiary of
Mid-Michigan Railroad, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "proposed Acquisition"). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP (the Petitioner) filed a Petition for Exemption (Petition) with the Board on August 25, 1998,
seeking exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502 from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323-25 for the acquisition and operation of an approximate 107-mile long NEKM rail line from Mid-Michigan Railroad, Inc.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  The Board will decide whether to grant or deny UP's petition and will
address potential environmental issues associated with the proposed Acquisition.  It may impose 
environmental conditions it deems appropriate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board is required to issue an exemption if it decides that application of all or part of otherwise-applicable law (1) is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and
(2) either the transaction is of limited scope, or regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from
an abuse of market power. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA concludes that if the Board imposes SEA's final recommended environmental mitigation
conditions, the proposed Acquisition would not have any significant adverse environmental impacts. 
The Board will consider the entire environmental record, the Draft EA and Final EA, all public
comments, and SEA's final environmental mitigation recommendations in making its final decision
on the proposed Acquisition.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Figure ES-1, "Proposed NEKM Acquisition," shows the rail line segment between Saint Joseph, Missouri and
Upland, Kansas that UP seeks to acquire.  SEA analyzed the potential environmental effects of changes in
rail traffic that would occur if the Board grants the Petition.  During its environmental review process, SEA
considered a broad  range of environmental issues that could affect communities on a regional and
local level.  This approach allowed SEA to identify and assess potential environmental impacts and
develop reasonable environmental mitigation.  During the review process, SEA sought input from
agencies, elected officials, organizations, businesses, and individuals.  In developing reasonable
environmental mitigation to address potential adverse environmental effects of the proposed
Acquisition, SEA balanced the various perspectives and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>concerns that the public raised and the range of environmental effects and issues.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On a regional basis, SEA identified several environmental benefits to air quality, freight rail operations safety,
and fuel consumption that would result from overall rail system improvements and operating efficiencies, but
no adverse environmental effects.  On a local or site-specific basis, SEA identified potential adverse
environmental effects in four issue areas (air quality, noise, freight rail operations safety, and
highway/rail at-grade crossing safety) and has recommended reasonable mitigation measures that
the Board could require UP to perform as conditions of approval.  SEA believes that if the Board
imposes SEA's final recommended environmental mitigation conditions, the proposed Acquisition would not
have any significant adverse environmental impacts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Final EA fully adopts and incorporates the Draft EA.  SEA intends that this Final EA, which includes
modifications and additions to the Draft EA, be used in conjunction with the Draft EA to provide complete
documentation of SEA's environmental review process.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP states that the acquisition of the NEKM rail line would be an integral part of its Service Recovery program
to add additional capacity to its Central Corridor.  UP would use the NEKM rail line primarily to route westbound
empty coal trains from the Kansas City, Kansas area to their destination in the Powder River Basin in
Wyoming.  The rerouting of the empty coal trains would relieve capacity constraints on UP's mainline track
between Kansas City, Topeka and Upland, Kansas--thereby reducing train delay and improving freight
delivery reliability and rail operations efficiency.  UP also states that the proposed Acquisition would improve
market access to shippers on the NEKM rail line.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The proposed Acquisition would allow UP to acquire the NEKM rail line between St. Joseph, Missouri and
Upland, Kansas.  NEKM currently operates approximately one train per day on its system, serving agricultural
and other customers along its  approximate 107-mile length.  UP would use the NEKM rail line to reroute
westbound empty coal trains over the NEKM rail line between Hiawatha, Kansas and Upland, Kansas.  These
coal trains currently use two routes to move between Kansas City, Kansas and Gibbon, Nebraska, as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Approximately 5.7 empty coal trains per day move north from Kansas City, Kansas through Hiawatha,
Kansas to Omaha, Nebraska.  At Omaha, these trains head west to Gibbon, Nebraska.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Approximately 9.3 empty coal trains per day move west from Kansas City, Kansas to Topeka, Kansas. 
At Topeka, these trains head north through Upland and Marysville, Kansas then on to Gibbon,
Nebraska.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>The rerouting of the empty coal trains would increase the train traffic by approximately 9.3 trains per day on
UP's existing mainline between Kansas City, Kansas and Hiawatha, Kansas.  Train traffic would increase by
an average 15 trains per day between Hiawatha, Kansas and Upland, Kansas.  There would be no change
in train traffic on the NEKM rail line between St. Joseph, Missouri and Hiawatha, Kansas.  Figure ES-2,
"Estimated Rail Traffic Changes from the Proposed Acquisition," shows UP's estimate for changes in freight
train traffic that would occur on rail line segments that  would be affected by the proposed Acquisition.  Of the
16 rail line segments that the proposed Acquisition would affect, five rail line segments would experience traffic
increases, 10 rail line segments would experience traffic decreases, and one rail line segment would
experience no change in train traffic.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>THE BOARD'S ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board is an independent Federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over certain surface transportation
matters, including railroad acquisitions and mergers.  When it determines that a transaction is consistent with
the public interest, the Board is required by statute to approve and authorize the proposed transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board's decision is a Federal action requiring environmental review under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA).  As part of its environmental analysis, the Board considers potential beneficial, and
potential adverse environmental effects.  SEA is responsible for conducting the environmental review on behalf
of the Board, and making final environmental mitigation recommendations to the Board.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In imposing environmental mitigation conditions, the Board has consistently focused on the potential
environmental impacts that would result directly from Acquisition-related changes in activity levels on existing
rail lines and at rail facilities.  The Board's practice consistently has been to mitigate only those conditions that
result directly from a proposed transaction.  The Board typically does not require mitigation for pre-existing
environmental conditions, such as effects associated with current railroad operations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>SEA's ACTIVITIES SINCE THE DRAFT EA</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After SEA issued the Draft EA, SEA undertook several activities related to the environmental review of the
proposed Acquisition.  SEA requested that UP provide a Verified Statement regarding operating data and
assumptions that SEA used in its environmental analysis.  SEA conducted additional analyses based on
additional information received from UP and the public during the

<p>comment period.  SEA has documented its methods, analysis results, and responses to comments in this Final
EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In its environmental review of the proposed Acquisition, SEA evaluated the following potential environmental
impact areas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Freight Rail Operations Safety.</li>
  <li>Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Safety.</li>
  <li>Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Delay.</li>
  <li>Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Emergency Vehicle Response.</li>
  <li>Energy.</li>
  <li>Air Quality.</li>
  <li>Noise.</li>
  <li>Environmental Justice.</li>
  <li>Cumulative Effects.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>SEA also evaluated the construction of a proposed 820-foot rail line connection that UP would construct as
part of the proposed Acquisition.  SEA reviewed this construction project for potential adverse environmental
effects that may occur outside railroad right-of-way. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA determined that the proposed Acquisition would have several positive effects on the environment.  These
benefits would occur on a regional basis, primarily through providing increased efficiency on existing routes. 
These potential benefits include reductions in fuel consumption, emissions, and freight rail accidents because
of a reduction in train-miles traveled by trains that would use the shorter NEKM route.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA also concluded that several environmental issue areas may experience adverse environmental effects
because of the proposed Acquisition.  These include the following:  (1) freight rail operations safety on the
Kansas City-Atchison, Atchison-Hiawatha, and Hiawatha-Upland rail line segments that would experience the
largest increases in freight rail traffic; (2) two highway/rail at-grade crossings  (i.e., one in Sabetha, Kansas
and one in Seneca, Kansas) that could experience adverse effects from proposed freight train increases; (3)
increases in County-wide emissions in four counties (i.e., Atchison, Brown, Nemaha, and Marshall), and; (4)
increased noise along the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In evaluating other environmental issue areas, SEA determined that there would be no potential adverse
impacts for the following issue areas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Emergency Vehicle Response.</li>
  <li>Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Delay.</li>
  <li>Energy.</li>
  <li>Regional Air Quality.</li>
  <li>Environmental Justice.</li>
  <li>Cumulative Effects.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>SEA also determined that there would be no potential adverse impacts from the construction of the proposed
rail line connection at Hiawatha, Kansas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA provided a 30-day period (ending January 20, 1999) during which the public could review and comment
on the Draft EA for the proposed Acquisition.  Based on some initial public comment requesting more time,
SEA extended the comment period to February 4, 1999.  To alert potentially affected communities and
individuals of SEA's environmental review and to encourage their comments, SEA conducted an extensive mail
notification process.  SEA encouraged all who received or reviewed the Draft EA to comment on environmental
issues, SEA's technical analysis, and the scope and adequacy of SEA's preliminary recommended mitigation
measures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In preparing this Final EA, SEA carefully reviewed the comments it received.  Overall, SEA received six
documents and some telephone calls with comments and on potential environmental effects of the proposed
Acquisition.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Most of the comments received concerned potential Acquisition-related effects on highway/rail at-grade
crossing safety, potential emergency response vehicle delay, and noise.  Based on the comments received,
SEA refined its analysis of highway/rail at-grade crossing delay and noise for the Final EA.  SEA also
requested that UP provide a verified statement for some of the operating assumptions used in the analysis of
potential environmental effects on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment, including the estimated number of
additional trains that would use the rail line segment, the estimated length of the trains, and the estimated train
speed.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>SEA's FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In developing final environmental mitigation recommendations, SEA fully considered all public comments and
conducted additional analyses where appropriate.  UP also volunteered to implement several mitigation
measures to address highway/rail at-grade crossing safety, emergency response vehicle delay, and noise in
affected communities.  As a result, SEA changed several mitigation recommendations from the Draft EA to
reflect concerns of commentors.  (See Chapter 3, "Summary of Comments and Responses," for more
information) SEA believes that it has developed comprehensive, reasonable, and practical environmental
mitigation recommendations that would address potential adverse environmental effects of the proposed
Acquisition.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA encourages the negotiation of mutually acceptable solutions to site-specific issues.  Indeed, by joint
petition filed March 12, 1999, UP, the City of Seneca, Kansas (the City) and the Nemaha Valley Parent
Teacher Association (NVPTA) requested that compliance with their jointly developed Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) entered into on March 12, 1999, be prescribed as a condition in lieu of any other
environmental mitigation conditions that might be imposed with respect to UP operations through the City.  The
MOU indicates that the comments filed by the City and NVPTA regarding the Draft EA will be deemed to have
been automatically withdrawn on the service date of a Board order imposing compliance with the MOU.  SEA
recommends that the Board grant the requested condition requiring that UP comply with the terms of the MOU. 


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Generally, negotiated agreements are more effective, and in some cases, more far reaching than
environmental options the Board would impose unilaterally.  Therefore, if UP and other affected communities
execute any negotiated agreement after the Final EA, the parties can ask the Board to include compliance with
the terms of those negotiated agreements as conditions of approval of the proposed Acquisition as an
alternative to local and site-specific mitigation recommended here. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based on its independent analysis of all the information available at this time and review of public comments
received, SEA concludes that the proposed Acquisition would not significantly affect the quality of the human
environment if UP implements the recommended mitigation measures set forth in this document.  The final
mitigation recommendations are as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Safety:  Freight Rail Operations</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 1</u>.</strong>   UP shall comply with the requirements in the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Proposed
Rule for "gross ton-mile based" inspections (49 CFR Part 213.237, Docket No. RST-90-1) on the following rail
line segments in Kansas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Kansas City-Atchison.</li>
  <li>Atchison-Hiawatha.</li>
  <li>Hiawatha-Upland.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>FRA's Proposed Rule includes a provision that specifically requires railroads to conduct track inspections to
detect rail flaws on a rail line segment at least once every 40 million gross tons per track mile or annually,
whichever is more frequent.  If FRA's Final Rule imposes a different inspection standard, then UP shall comply
with the standard in the Final Rule.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Safety:  Highway/Rail At-grade Crossings</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 2</strong></u>.  UP shall continue its consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),
the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) and the communities along the Hiawatha-Upland
corridor to implement the recommendations of the Corridor Review Team composed of UP, FRA,
and KDOT.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 3</strong></u>.  Subject to any agreement reached in ongoing consultations pursuant to Condition 2,
UP shall upgrade the highway/rail at-grade crossing warning device at 6<sup>th</sup> Street in Sabetha, Kansas 
from crossbucks to flashing lights. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 4</strong></u>.  As agreed to by UP, UP shall undertake the following measures:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>UP will provide Operation Lifesaver programs in the future as requested by
communities on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will install UP's standard private crossing signs and stop signs at all private
highway/rail at-grade crossings which are open to public use.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will upgrade, where necessary, all existing highway/rail at-grade crossing signal
circuitry to accommodate the proposed rail operations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>At all highway/rail at-grade crossings with active warning devices, UP will post a
visible emergency toll free 800 number to be called if signal crossing devices
malfunction.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will provide toll free numbers to all emergency response forces in communities
affected by the proposed Acquisition.  These numbers will provide access to
appropriate UP personnel who may be contacted by communities in emergency
situations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will offer Grade Crossing Collision Investigation classes and emergency response
training to law enforcement agencies and first responders in affected communities.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>To enhance highway/rail at-grade crossing safety, UP will undertake vegetation
control procedures along the Hiawatha-Upland corridor.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  </ol>
</ol>

<p><strong>Noise</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 5</u>.</strong>  UP shall consult with state and local officials to find suitable approaches for mitigating the
adverse noise effects in the following communities on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment in Kansas:   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Hamlin</li>
  <li>Morrill</li>
  <li>Sabetha</li>
  <li>Oneida</li>
  <li>Baileyville</li>
  <li>Axtell</li>
  <li>Beattie</li>
  <li>Home</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>Mitigation for a specific community may include a combination of:  (1) eliminating highway/rail at-grade
crossings, (2) installing safety measures that meet future FRA requirements for no-horn quiet zones, or (3)
other measures as UP and affected community may negotiate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Negotiated Agreement</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 6</strong></u>.  UP shall comply with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, dated March
12, 1999, executed by the UP, City of Seneca, Kansas, and the Nemaha Valley Parent Teachers
Association, regarding local environmental issues associated with this transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Air Quality</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 7</strong></u>.  As agreed to by UP, the UP will use operating practices that are designed to reduce
locomotive fuel consumption and emissions.  These include throttle modulation, use of dynamic
braking, increased use of pacing and coasting trains and isolating unneeded horsepower.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Monitoring and Enforcement Condition</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 8</u>.</strong>  If  there is a material change in the facts or circumstances upon which the Board relied in
imposing specific environmental mitigation conditions in this Decision, and upon petition by any party who
demonstrates such material changes, the Board may review the continuing applicability of its final mitigation,
if warranted.

<p><center><strong>CHAPTER 1</center>
</strong>

<p><strong><center>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</strong></center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Surface Transportation Board (the Board), Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA), prepared this Final
Environmental Assessment (Final EA) to identify and evaluate the potential environmental effects of the
acquisition of an approximate 107-mile long rail line of the Northeast Kansas and Missouri Railroad (NEKM)
between St. Joseph, Missouri and Upland, Kansas by the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP).  Chapter 1
describes the purpose of and need for the proposed Acquisition, the environmental review process for the
project, and the role of the Board and SEA in conducting the environmental review. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.1	BACKGROUND OF THE PROPOSED ACTION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On August 25, 1998, UP filed a Petition for Exemption with the Board seeking an exemption under 49 U.S.C.
10502 from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323-25 for the acquisition and operation of the
NEKM rail line segment from Mid-Michigan Railroad, Inc.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>   The Board is required to issue an exemption if it
decides that application of all or part of otherwise-applicable law (1) is not necessary to carry out the rail
transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and (2) either the transaction is of limited scope, or regulation
is not necessary to protect shippers from an abuse of market power.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP has stated that the proposed Acquisition would be part of its Service Recovery program to add
additional capacity to UP's Central Corridor and to provide service to shippers served by the NEKM
rail line.  The proposed Acquisition would allow UP to reroute westbound empty coal trains from
Kansas City, Kansas to the Powder River Basin in Wyoming over the acquired rail line.  The
rerouting of these empty coal trains would relieve capacity constraints on a segment of UP's
Marysville Subdivision between Kansas City, Topeka, and Upland, Kansas.  The Kansas City-Topeka portion of UP's Marysville Subdivision is a critical link in UP's rail corridor between the
Midwest and Los Angeles, California.  UP has stated that the proposed Acquisition would improve
its rail operation between the Midwest and Los Angeles.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP stated that a number of benefits relate directly to the proposed Acquisition of the NEKM, 
including the following: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Reduced train delay on UP's mainline between Kansas City, Topeka, and Upland, Kansas,
as a result of diverting westbound empty coal trains over the NEKM line.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Better utilization of freight cars, locomotives, and train crews to reduce operating costs,
maintenance, and delays.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Reduced fuel consumption (and corresponding reductions in emissions) because the NEKM
route is shorter than the current routes used by the empty coal trains.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Improved market access opportunities for shippers along the NEKM line.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>Figure 1-1, "Existing NEKM and UP Rail Systems" shows the NEKM rail line that UP proposes to
acquire.  See Section 1.3, "The Proposed Action and Alternatives," for a detailed discussion of the
proposed action.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.2	THE BOARD'S ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that a Federal agency conduct an environmental
review of a proposed action if it has the potential to cause environmental impacts.  The Board determined that
the proposed Acquisition warranted the preparation of an environmental assessment, based on the nature and
extent of environmental issues that the proposed Acquisition would cause.  NEPA requires that the Board
conduct and complete this environmental review process before issuing a final decision on the proposed
Acquisition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board is a nonpartisan, decisionally independent adjudicatory body, which is organizationally housed
within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  The Board has jurisdiction over certain transportation
matters such as rail rates; financial transactions, including railroad acquisitions and consolidations; rail
constructions; and abandonment of rail service.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) Termination
Act of 1995<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> established the Board to assume some of the regulatory functions that the ICC previously
administered.  The Act either eliminated or transferred other ICC regulatory functions to different DOT
agencies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board's charge is to provide an efficient and effective forum for the resolution of disputes
within its jurisdiction.  In all of its decisions, the Board is committed to advancing the national
transportation policy goals established by Congress.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1920, Congress established a national policy favoring railroad consolidations in the interest of economy and
efficiency.  Congress reaffirmed its rail consolidation policy in subsequent 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Figure 1-1	Existing NEKM and UP Rail Systems

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act, and it requires the Board, as it required the ICC, to approve rail
consolidation transactions that are in the public interest.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  In determining the public interest, the Board's well-established and court-approved practice is to balance the gains in operating efficiency and marketing
capability realized through a particular railroad consolidation against any consequent reduction in
competition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board licenses railroads as common carriers, requiring that railroads accept goods and materials for
transport from all customers upon reasonable request.  If a railroad simply wants to upgrade a portion of its
system or improve service to certain shippers, it may do so without seeking the Board's permission.  The
Board, therefore, has no control over the level of service.  It does not regulate the number of trains operating
over a specific section of rail line or maintain control over general day-to-day operations of railroads.  Railroads
make decisions on an ongoing basis regarding which routes they will use in response to changes in market
conditions, the economy, and shipper demands.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board considers the potential environmental effects of a transaction in its review of proposed railroad
mergers and acquisitions.  The Board can impose environmental conditions to offset or reduce the potential
environmental impacts of the proposed action.  In conducting its environmental review, the Board considers
the requirements of NEPA; other related environmental laws and their implementing regulations; and the
former ICC environmental regulations at 49&nbsp;CFR 1105.7, which the Board has adopted.  SEA is responsible
for conducting the environmental review of the proposed Acquisition on behalf of the Board.  The Board's
environmental regulations govern SEA's environmental review process and outline SEA's procedures for
preparing environmental documents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the Environmental Report that UP submitted with its Petition, SEA requested that UP submit a 
Preliminary Draft Environmental Assessment (PDEA).   SEA reviewed and verified all the information in UP's
PDEA and prepared a Draft EA using information and analysis from the PDEA.  SEA prepared this Final EA
after considering all the public comments received on the Draft EA and reviewing all other available
environmental information.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.3	THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.3.1	Existing NEKM System</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NEKM rail line that UP proposes to acquire operates between St. Joseph, Missouri and Upland, Kansas,
a distance of approximately 107 miles.  The NEKM rail line traverses the counties of Doniphan, Brown,
Nemaha, and Marshall in the State of Kansas and Buchanan County in the State of Missouri.   NEKM also has
trackage rights on an existing UP rail line segment from Upland, Kansas to Marysville, Kansas, a distance of
approximately 7 miles in Marshall County, Kansas.  NEKM currently operates approximately one local train
per day between St. Joseph, Missouri and Marysville, Kansas<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, providing a means for local shippers of
agricultural products to interchange with UP rail lines at Hiawatha and Marysville, Kansas and St. Joseph,
Missouri.  NEKM's local traffic is seasonal in nature--most of the freight activity occurs in the early summer
and late fall harvest periods.  The NEKM train is limited to a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour on its
mainline track. 

<p> 

<p><strong>1.3.2	Existing UP System</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP currently operates more than 36,000 miles of rail lines in 23 states, including about 2,618 miles of rail lines
in Kansas.  Approximately 15 empty coal trains leave Kansas City, Kansas each day toward the Powder River
Basin in Wyoming.  UP currently routes approximately 9.3 of these empty coal trains over its existing mainline
track that runs west from Kansas City, Kansas through Topeka, Kansas and then north through Marysville,
Kansas to Gibbon, Nebraska.  (See Figure 1-1, "Existing UP and NEKM Rail Systems") This route covers a
distance of about 281 miles between Kansas City, Kansas and Gibbon, Nebraska.  The other approximate 5.7
empty coal trains per day use UP's existing mainline that runs from Kansas City, Kansas north to Omaha,
Nebraska. From Omaha, Nebraska, these trains continue west to Gibbon, Nebraska.  The northern route
between Kansas City, Omaha and Gibbon, Nebraska covers a distance of approximately 365 miles.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.3.3	Combined UP/NEKM System</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP has stated that the proposed Acquisition would be part of its Service Recovery program to add additional
capacity to UP's Central Corridor and to provide service to shippers served by the NEKM rail line.  The
proposed Acquisition would allow UP to reroute westbound empty coal trains between Kansas City, Kansas
and Gibbon, Nebraska over part of the acquired NEKM rail line between Hiawatha, Kansas and Upland,
Kansas.  The rerouting of these empty coal trains would relieve capacity constraints on UP's mainline between
Kansas City, Topeka, and Upland, Kansas.  The Kansas City-Topeka rail line segment is a critical link in UP's
rail corridor between the Midwest and Los Angeles, California.  UP has stated that the proposed Acquisition
would improve its rail operation between the Midwest and Los Angeles, California.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The rerouting of the westbound empty coal trains would increase the train traffic by approximately 9.3 trains
per day on the existing UP mainline between Kansas City, Kansas and Hiawatha, Kansas.  Train traffic would
increase by approximately 15 trains per day between Hiawatha, Kansas and Upland, Kansas.  Figure 1-2,
"Estimated Traffic Changes From the Proposed Acquisition," shows the Acquisition-related change in estimated
train traffic for each affected rail line segment between Kansas City, Kansas and Gibbon, Nebraska.  The route
between Kansas City, Kansas and Gibbon, Nebraska via the NEKM rail line covers a distance of about 293
miles.  The route to Gibbon, Nebraska over the NEKM rail line would be about 12 miles longer than UP's
current route via Topeka, Kansas and about 71 miles shorter than UP's current route via Omaha, Nebraska. 


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP plans to upgrade portions of the Hiawatha-Upland segment of the NEKM rail line to Class III track, which
would allow trains to travel over the upgraded portions at speeds up to 40 miles per hour (versus the current
maximum speed of 25 miles per hour).  The upgrade work would consist of track, wood tie, and anchor
replacement plus the addition of ballast along the upgraded rail line.  UP also plans to evaluate and, as
necessary, rebuild public and private highway/rail at-grade crossings along the Hiawatha-Upland rail line
segment.  The improvements at these highway/rail at-grade crossings would not include modification of
existing crossing protection devices.  UP does not plan to upgrade the portion of the NEKM rail line between
St. Joseph, Missouri and Hiawatha, Kansas.

<p>  

<p>UP proposes to construct a connection between the existing UP mainline track and the NEKM mainline track
in Hiawatha, Kansas.   The proposed connection would begin approximately 900 feet north of Miami Street
in Hiawatha.  UP would construct the approximate 820-foot long connection entirely on existing railroad right-of-way. (See Figure 1-3, "Proposed Rail Line Connection at Hiawatha, Kansas--Area Map.")

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.3.4	Alternatives to the Proposed Action</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the proposed Acquisition is not completed, UP would continue to route its empty westbound coal trains via
the Kansas City-Topeka-Gibbon corridor and the Kansas City-Omaha-Gibbon corridors.  The total miles that
trains would travel via the current routes would be greater than the total miles via the NEKM route and the
benefits associated with a reduction in total train-miles (i.e., fuel consumption, emissions, and freight rail
operations safety benefits) would not occur.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition,  UP would have to upgrade its rail line between Kansas City and Marysville, Kansas to relieve
current capacity constraints and to accommodate future growth in train volume.  This would involve the
construction of a second mainline track between Topeka, Kansas and Marysville, Kansas, and expansion of
UP's rail yard in Topeka, Kansas.

<p><strong>1.4	AGENCY CONSULTATION AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION ACTIVITIES</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Under NEPA, agencies undertaking Federal actions must consult with other government agencies and involve
the public in preparing environmental documents.  In conducting agency coordination and consultation,
SEA complied with NEPA environmental review requirements and considered pertinent Federal
statutes and executive orders.  As with its public involvement effort, SEA conducted agency
coordination and consultation activities to ensure that public agencies were aware of the proposed
Acquisition and had adequate time to review and comment on the Draft EA.  SEA considered all
comments submitted by Federal and State agencies in preparing this Final EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As part of the environmental review process, SEA conducted public involvement activities to inform the public
about the proposed Acquisition and encourage broad public involvement in the environmental review process.
SEA's public involvement efforts included distributing an October 1998 informational fact sheet to potentially
affected communities prior to publishing the Draft EA.  SEA distributed the Draft EA to more than 100
agencies, communities, companies and individuals that the proposed Acquisition could potentially affect. The
Draft EA provided instructions on how to submit comments. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.5 	OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC COMMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA issued the Draft EA for the proposed Acquisition to the public on December 21, 1998.  SEA encouraged
all who received or reviewed the Draft EA to comment on the technical analysis and the scope and adequacy
of SEA's preliminary mitigation recommendations.  Comments on the Draft EA were due on January 20, 1999. 
On January 20, 1999, SEA received a request from the City of Seneca, Kansas (the City) to extend the
comment period so that the City could conduct a more detailed review of the Draft EA.  SEA granted an
extension of the comment period until February 4, 1999. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In preparing the Final EA, SEA considered all comments that it received from the public.  Appendix A,
"Comments Received on the Draft Environmental Assessment," contains a copy of all written public comments
received by February 4, 1999.  SEA received six documents and some telephone calls commenting on the
Draft EA from affected communities; community groups and UP. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On March 12, 1999, the City, the Nemaha Valley Parent Teachers Association (NVPTA) and UP jointly
petitioned the Board to substitute compliance with their jointly negotiated Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), also dated March 12, 1999, as a condition in lieu of any other environmental mitigation conditions
relating to UP operations through the City.  The MOU also indicates that the comments previously submitted
by the City and NVPTA regarding the Draft EA will be deemed to have been withdrawn automatically on the
service date of a Board order imposing compliance with the MOU.  SEA has reviewed the MOU and
recommends that the Board grant the requested condition requiring that UP comply with it, as an alternative
to any other mitigation for the City.  

<p>It also should be noted that SEA undertook further verification and analysis of data as a result of the comments
filed by the City and NVPTA.  The analysis is in this Final EA.  The further analysis based on updated data
show that the preliminary conclusions reached in the Draft EA remain valid because the new data were not
materially different from the data used in the Draft EA.

<p align="center"><strong>SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This chapter summarizes SEA's overall environmental review process, methods of analysis, additional
analyses that SEA conducted since the Draft EA, and conclusions.  The initial sections of Chapter 2 describe
the scope of SEA's environmental review and the thresholds that SEA used in conducting this review.  For
each environmental issue area that SEA reviewed, this chapter summarizes the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Methods of Analysis.</li>
  <li>Criteria of significance.</li>
  <li>Analysis Results and Impacts, including additional evaluation that SEA conducted since the Draft EA.</li>
  <li>Mitigation measures.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>This chapter also describes potential impacts of acquisition-related construction projects and potential
cumulative effects from changes in agency regulations or from projects identified by interested parties during
the public comment period.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A more detailed discussion of SEA's environmental review of the proposed Acquisition is presented in Chapter
3, "Environmental Consequences of the Proposed Action," in the Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.1	THRESHOLDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA used information provided by UP to identify projected changes in rail traffic on rail line segments that
could result in potential environmental effects.  In response to public comment on the Draft EA, SEA requested
that UP provide a verified statement to support its estimates for pre- and post-Acquisition train volumes and
tonnages.  (See Appendix B, "Verified Statements") UP provided information to confirm its previous estimates
for train volume changes on affected rail line segments.  However, UP indicated that the tonnage estimates
used in the Draft EA would likely change due to its planned use of longer coal trains within the next three
years.  Table 2.1-1, "Pre and Post-Acquisition Estimates for Rail Traffic and Gross Ton-Miles on Affected Rail
Line Segments," presents the revised figures that SEA used in the Final EA.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In its environmental rules at 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1105.7(e) and during environmental review
of previous railroad mergers and acquisitions, the Board has identified thresholds of railroad activity that
warrant environmental review.  SEA used these thresholds to screen proposed increases in rail activities and
identify the environmental issue areas to evaluate.  

<p>Table 2.1-2, "Board's Thresholds for Environmental Analysis," lists the thresholds that SEA used in  its
environmental review of the proposed Acquisition.

<p>Based on information provided by UP, the following rail line segments would exceed the Board's thresholds
for environmental analysis:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Kansas City, Kansas to Atchison, Kansas, where UP estimates that rail traffic would increase by
approximately 9.3 trains per day.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Atchison, Kansas to Hiawatha, Kansas, where UP estimates that rail traffic would increase by

approximately 15 trains per day.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>UP also proposes to construct a connection between the existing UP and NEKM rail lines in Hiawatha, Kansas. 
The proposed connection would allow northbound empty coal trains to be rerouted west over the NEKM rail
line to Upland, Kansas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.2	SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based on the post-Acquisition operational data provided by UP and the Board's thresholds for environmental
analysis listed in Table 2.1-2, SEA determined that its review of the proposed Acquisition would cover the
following environmental issue areas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Safety, including freight rail operations and safety at highway/rail at-grade crossings.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Highway/rail at-grade crossings, including vehicle delay and emergency vehicle response delay.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Energy.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Air Quality, including operational changes on rail line segments and vehicle delay at highway/rail at-grade crossings.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Noise.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Environmental Justice.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>SEA also evaluated the construction of a proposed rail line connection at Hiawatha, Kansas for potential
effects outside of the railroad right-of-way.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA did not evaluate the following issue areas because the proposed Acquisition would not affect these issue
areas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Rail line abandonment.</li>
  <li>Operational changes at rail yards, intermodal facilities, or other railroad facilities.</li>
  <li>Freight diversion to or from other modes of transportation.</li>
  <li>Transportation of recyclable commodities, energy resources, and ozone depleting materials.</li>
  <li>Transportation of hazardous materials.</li>
  <li>Effects on navigation from changes in rail operation over movable bridges.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p><strong>2.3	FREIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS SAFETY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA evaluated potential changes in freight train accidents that could occur as a result of the proposed
Acquisition at a regional level and on individual rail line segments.  SEA used accident data from Kansas
Department of Transportation (Kansas DOT), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Association of American
Railroads (AAR), and UP to analyze potential freight rail safety issues.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This section summarizes SEA's freight rail safety analysis methods.  Section 3.1, "Freight Rail Operations
Safety," of the Draft EA describes the methods in detail.  SEA's analysis methods and significance criteria
remain unchanged from the Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Regional Analysis</u>.</strong>  To evaluate potential regional freight rail safety effects in the Draft EA, SEA calculated
the probability of accidents occurring before and after the proposed Acquisition, based on estimated train mile
data provided by UP. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Individual Rail Line Segment Analysis</u>.</strong>  SEA evaluated the potential change in the risk of freight train
accidents for the three rail line segments that would have an increase of 8 or more trains per day following the
proposed Acquisition.  SEA estimated the average annual accident rate for each rail line segment, based on
FRA train accident/incident database for freight operations before and after the proposed Acquisition, and
estimated train data provided by UP.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA developed a criterion of significance for freight rail safety on individual rail line
segments based on recent historical accident data for UP.  SEA determined that Acquisition-related increases
in rail activity could potentially create adverse safety effects if the post-Acquisition accident rate was more
frequent than one accident every 150 years per track-mile; in which case SEA considered mitigation measures
for those safety effects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Regional Results</u>.</strong>  SEA estimated that the overall accident rate would decrease slightly on the 14 rail line
segments that changes in Acquisition-related rail traffic would affect.  Based on the analysis, SEA concluded
that the proposed Acquisition would not adversely affect freight rail operations safety on a regional basis.  SEA
did not revise its regional analysis of freight rail operations safety for the Final EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Individual Rail Segment Results</u>.</strong>  For the Final EA, UP provided SEA with updated information about the
length of coal trains that it plans to route over the NEKM rail line.  (See the verified statement of Robert M.
Scoggins in Appendix B, "Verified Statements")   UP estimates that post-acquisition coal trains will average
127 cars in length, versus the 117-car length that SEA used in its analysis for the Draft EA.  For the Final EA,
SEA calculated new estimates for individual rail line segment accident rate frequency based on the updated
coal train length.  Table 2.3-1, "Mainline Freight Accident Analysis," presents SEA's revised estimates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA estimated that the post-Acquisition accident frequency would exceed the criterion of significance for
individual rail line segment freight accidents for each of the three rail line segments in Kansas listed in Table
2.3-1.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA recommended that UP comply with the requirement in FRA's final rule for "ton-mile" based
inspections on the three rail line segments that exceeded SEA's criterion of significance for individual rail line
segment freight accidents.  In its comments on the Draft EA, UP volunteered additional mitigation strategies
to help reduce potential freight train safety risk impacts.  In the Final EA, SEA recommends that the Board
require UP to implement the FRA's gross ton-mile based inspection standard and the additional voluntary
mitigation measures proposed by UP.  (See Chapter 4, "Recommended Environmental Conditions")

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.4	HIGHWAY/RAIL AT-GRADE CROSSING SAFETY  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA analyzed potential effects on roadway users from Acquisition-related increases in train traffic at
highway/rail at-grade crossings.   SEA conducted its safety analysis of highway/rail at-grade crossings by
estimating the pre- and post-Acquisition accident frequency at each affected highway/rail at-grade crossing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This section summarizes SEA's highway/rail at-grade crossing safety analysis methods.  Section 3.2,
"Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Safety," of the Draft EA describes the methods in detail.  SEA's analysis
methods and significance criteria remain unchanged from the Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Accident Frequency Calculation</u>.</strong>  SEA used databases maintained by FRA containing information about
train-vehicle accidents at highway/rail at-grade crossings.  Using pre- and post-Acquisition freight train traffic
estimates provided by UP and standard FRA methods and formulas, SEA calculated the pre- and post-Acquisition accident frequency for each public highway/rail at-grade crossing on rail line segments that
exceeded the Board's threshold for environmental analysis.  SEA's analysis considered crossing-specific
factors such as the type of warning device, the accident history at the highway/rail at-grade crossing, the daily
number of trains, average train speed, and the roadway average daily traffic volume.  SEA obtained the most
recent roadway average daily traffic volume from the Kansas DOT.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA established two levels of increases in accident frequency likely to result in a
potential adverse effect on highway/rail at-grade crossing safety.  For highway/rail at-grade crossings that are
considered "high accident frequency" crossings, SEA considered an increase of at least 0.01 accidents per
year (or one additional accident every 100 years) to be potentially significant.  For all other highway/rail at-grade crossings, SEA considered an increase of at least 0.05 accidents per year (or one additional accident
every 20 years) to be potentially significant.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA estimated that the Acquisition-related increase in accident frequency would exceed the
significance criteria for highway/rail at-grade crossing safety at two highway/rail at-grade crossings in Nemaha
County, Kansas.  These crossings are:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>6<sup>th</sup> Street in Sabetha, Kansas</li>
  <li>5<sup>th</sup> Street in Seneca, Kansas.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>SEA determined that the predicted increase in accident frequency at all other highway/rail at-grade crossings
on Acquisition-affected rail line segments would be below the criteria of significance.  SEA did not revise its
analysis of highway/rail at-grade crossing safety for the Final EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA recommended that the warning devices at 6<sup>th</sup> Street in Sabetha, Kansas and 5<sup>th</sup> Street
in Seneca, Kansas be upgraded from cross bucks to flashing lights.  These upgrades would reduce the
predicted increase in accident frequency at these two locations to levels below SEA's criteria of significance. 
The City of Seneca, as previously noted, has reached an agreement with UP which now substitutes for the
Draft EA recommendation for the City.  Therefore, SEA's final recommended condition deletes 5<sup>th</sup> Street in
Seneca.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Moreover, following publication of the Draft EA, the Kansas DOT, FRA and UP jointly conducted a corridor-based review of highway/rail at-grade crossing safety between Hiawatha, Kansas and Upland, Kansas. SEA
understands that Kansas DOT has developed recommendations for highway/rail at-grade crossing
improvements and/or closure in several communities along this rail corridor.  UP has also volunteered to
implement additional mitigation measures to enhance highway/rail at-grade crossing safety awareness for
residents in affected communities.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Final EA, SEA therefore recommends that the Board require UP to upgrade the highway/rail at-grade
crossing warning device at 6<sup>th</sup> Street in Sabetha, Kansas from crossbucks to flashing lights, subject to any
alternative mitigation which may be developed in on-going negotiations by UP, the Federal Railroad
Administration, and Kansas Department of Transportation and affected communities on the Hiawatha-Upland
line.  In addition, UP voluntarily agreed to undertake additional mitigation measures regarding highway/rail at-grade crossing safety involving this project.  SEA recommends that the additional measures be required of UP,
namely:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>UP will provide Operation Lifesaver programs in the future as requested by communities on
the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>UP will install UP's standard private crossing signs and stop signs at all private highway/rail
at-grade crossings which are open to public use.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>UP will upgrade, where necessary, all existing highway/rail at-grade crossing signal circuitry
to accommodate the proposed rail operations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>At all highway/rail at-grade crossings with active warning devices, UP will post a visible
emergency toll free 800 number to be called if signal crossing devices malfunction.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>UP will provide toll free numbers to all emergency response forces in communities affected
by the proposed Acquisition.  These numbers will provide access to appropriate UP
personnel who may be contacted by communities in emergency situations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>UP will offer Grade Crossing Collision Investigation classes and emergency response
training to law enforcement agencies and first responders in affected communities.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>To enhance highway/rail at-grade crossing safety, UP will undertake vegetation control
procedures along the Hiawatha-Upland corridor.</li>
</ol>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.5	HIGHWAY/RAIL AT-GRADE CROSSING DELAY  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA evaluated changes in vehicle traffic delays that would result from increased train traffic on Acquisition-affected rail line segments.  SEA limited its assessment of vehicle delay to highway/rail at-grade crossings on
rail line segments that would have an Acquisition-related increase in train traffic of eight trains per day or
greater.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This section summarizes SEA's highway/rail at-grade crossing vehicle delay analysis methods. 
Section 3.3, "Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Delay," of the Draft EA describes the methods in
detail.  SEA's analysis methods and significance criteria remain unchanged from the Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA identified public highway/rail at-grade crossings on rail line segments that
would meet or exceed the Board's thresholds for environmental analysis.  SEA analyzed potential
changes in vehicle delay at all highway/rail at-grade crossings with an average daily traffic (ADT)
volume of 5,000 vehicles or greater.  SEA believes that its use of this traffic volume threshold is
reasonable and conservative and that the effects of vehicle delay at highway/rail at-grade crossings
with lower traffic volume would be minimal.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA used two methods to compare vehicle delay before and after the proposed Acquisition.  These
methods are:  (1) crossing delay per stopped vehicle; and (2) traffic level of service (LOS).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Verified Statement of Robert M. Scoggins (see Appendix B, "Verified Statements"), UP
provided updated information for projected average train length of its coal trains that would use the
rail line segments affected by the proposed Acquisition.  For the Final EA, SEA used the updated
train length estimate to revise its analysis of potential affects on vehicle delay at individual
highway/rail at-grade crossings, using the same analysis methods from the Draft EA.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA considered the increase in vehicle delay caused by Acquisition-related changes in train traffic to be significant if any of the following would occur:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>The crossing delay per stopped vehicle increased by 30 seconds or more.  SEA considered
the 30-second increment to represent a driver's threshold for perception of increased delay.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The post-Acquisition LOS decreased to a level of D from a pre-Acquisition level of C or
better or the post-Acquisition LOS decreased to E or F, regardless of the pre-Acquisition
LOS.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA identified two highway/rail at-grade crossings in Atchison County, Kansas that have an ADT
greater than 5,000 vehicles per day and that would experience an increase in train traffic in excess
of the Board's threshold for environmental analysis.  Using the updated average train length
information provided by UP, SEA revised its analysis for potential vehicle delay at these two
highway/rail at-grade crossings.  Table 2.5-1, "Individual Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Delay,"
presents the results of SEA's revised analysis.  For these two highway/rail at-grade crossings, SEA
determined that post-Acquisition vehicle delay would not exceed its criteria of significance for
crossing delay per stopped vehicle or traffic LOS.  SEA concluded that the proposed Acquisition
would not adversely affect vehicle delay.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA concluded that the proposed Acquisition would not adversely affect vehicle delay at individual
highway/rail at-grade crossings; therefore, mitigation is not warranted for potential vehicle delay
effects.

potential effects on emergency vehicle response.

<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Draft EA, SEA estimated the change crossing delay per stopped vehicle, total daily blocked
time, and average delay for all vehicles for various combinations of roadway lanes, train speeds, and
ADT volume.  SEA developed general estimates for 2-lane and 4-lane roads with ADT volumes of
500 and 1,000 vehicles per day and train speeds that would represent pre-Acquisition and post-Acquisition conditions.  SEA also determined the pre- and post-Acquisition level of service for these
highway/rail at-grade crossings.    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Verified Statement of Robert M. Scoggins (see Appendix B, "Verified Statements"), UP
provided updated information for projected average train length of its coal trains that would use the
rail line segments affected by the proposed Acquisition.  For the Final EA, SEA used the updated
train length estimate to revise its general analysis of potential affects on emergency vehicle response
time, using the same analysis methods from the Draft EA. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Final EA, SEA revised its analysis based on the updated average train length provided by
UP.  Table 2.6-1, "General Analysis of Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing Delay," presents the results
of SEA's revised general analysis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA concluded the following, based on its revised analysis of potential emergency response vehicle
delay effects:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>The level of service at highway/rail at-grade crossings on the Kansas City-Atchison rail line
segment would be A or B where the train speed is 40 miles per hour for both pre- and post-Acquisition conditions.  The level of service would drop from B to C at highway/rail at-grade
crossings in the City of Atchison where the train speed is 20 miles per hour. </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>For the Atchison-Hiawatha rail line segment, the level of service would be A under both pre-
and post-Acquisition conditions at highway/rail at-grade crossings where the train speed is
40 miles per hour.  The level of service would drop from B to C at highway/rail at-grade
crossings where the train speed is 20 miles per hour.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>For the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment, the level of service would be A under both pre-
and post-Acquisition conditions, assuming an average train speed of 25 miles per hour for
pre-Acquisition and 35 miles per hour for post-Acquisition. </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>Based on the level of service criteria for highway/rail at-grade crossings, SEA concluded that the
proposed Acquisition would not adversely affect emergency response vehicle delay.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA concluded that the proposed Acquisition would not adversely affect emergency
response vehicle delay; therefore, it did not recommend mitigation measures.   SEA requested public
comment about community-specific conditions that might affect emergency vehicle response.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The City of Seneca submitted comments on the Draft EA requesting that SEA conduct a more
detailed site-specific analysis of Acquisition-related emergency response vehicle effects in Seneca. 
(See Section 3.3, "Emergency Vehicle Response,") However, the MOU negotiated by UP, the City,
and NVPTA covers this issue.  Therefore, SEA is not recommending specific emergency vehicle
response delay mitigation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.7	ENERGY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA evaluated the potential effects of the proposed Acquisition on diesel fuel consumption due to
Acquisition-related changes in freight train traffic and from potential vehicle delays at public
highway/rail at-grade crossings.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA estimated the overall change in freight train diesel fuel consumption using UP's estimates for
changes in freight train gross-ton miles on Acquisition-affected rail line segments and rail line
segment-specific fuel efficiency factors.  For fuel consumption from vehicle delays at highway/rail
at-grade crossings, SEA determined the pre-Acquisition and post-Acquisition number of vehicles
delayed per day and the crossing delay per stopped vehicle for highway/rail at-grade crossings that
SEA analyzed for potential vehicle delay effects.  (See Section 2.5, "Highway/Rail At-grade
Crossing Vehicle Delay") SEA used a fuel consumption factor for idling vehicles to obtain its
estimate of annual change in fuel consumption from vehicle delays. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As detailed in the Verified Statement of Robert M. Scoggins, UP revised its estimate of average train
length for coal trains that would use the rail line segments affected by the proposed Acquisition. (see
Appendix B, "Verified Statements") UP also updated its estimate of post-Acquisition annual gross
ton-miles on Acquisition-affected rail line segments, as a result of the revised coal train length.  (See
Table 2.1-1, "Pre- and Post-Acquisition Estimates for Rail Traffic and Gross Ton-Miles on Affected
Rail Segments") SEA used the revised gross ton-mile estimates to update its estimate for fuel
consumption effects of the proposed Acquisition.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA considered an increase in overall net fuel consumption to be
significant. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Table 2.7-1, "Summary of Fuel Consumption Changes," presents SEA's estimate for annual fuel
savings from the proposed Acquisition.  SEA's revised estimate shows an annual savings of about
1.1 million gallons of fuel. UP would achieve this fuel savings because the proposed Acquisition
would allow UP to reduce the total train miles on its rail system.

<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Because there would be a net savings in annual fuel consumption, SEA concludes that no mitigation
for energy effects is warranted.  UP, however, has volunteered mitigation to address this issue, and
SEA therefore recommends adoption of UP's proposed mitigation.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.8	AIR QUALITY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA estimated the potential effects of the proposed Acquisition on air quality at a regional and
County-wide level.  SEA's analysis focused on emissions from diesel locomotives and idling
vehicles delayed at highway/rail at-grade crossings, because these are the major sources of emissions
that the proposed Acquisition would affect.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In conducting its air quality analysis, SEA used the Board's thresholds for air quality analysis and
EPA-recommended emissions guidelines to estimate emissions.  Since EPA considers all counties
affected by the proposed Acquisition to be in attainment with ambient air quality standards, the
applicable Board threshold for environmental analysis is an increase of eight or more trains per day
on any Acquisition-affected rail line segment.  Section 3.6, "Air Quality," of the Draft EA presents
a detailed description of the methods of analysis.  SEA's methods of analysis in the Final EA are
unchanged from the Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Verified Statement of Robert M. Scoggins, UP revised its estimate of average train length for
coal trains that would use the rail line segments affected by the proposed Acquisition. (see Appendix
B, "Verified Statements") UP also updated its estimate of post-Acquisition annual gross ton-miles
on Acquisition-affected rail line segments, as a result of the revised coal train length.  (See Table
2.1-1, "Pre- and Post-Acquisition Estimates for Rail Traffic and Gross Ton-Miles on Affected Rail
Segments") SEA used the revised gross ton-mile estimates to update its estimate for air quality
effects of the proposed Acquisition.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Regional Analysis</u>.</strong>  For its regional analysis, SEA estimated the change in emissions for rail line
segments that would experience both increases and decreases in freight train activity as a result of
the proposed Acquisition.  UP provided SEA with route-specific fuel efficiency factors for its line-haul locomotives and estimates for the change in gross ton-miles for each Acquisition-affected rail
line segment.  In its analysis, SEA used EPA emissions factors representative of the 1998 locomotive
fleet for all U.S. railroads.   SEA also estimated emissions for idling vehicles at highway/rail at-grade crossings with an ADT of 5,000 vehicles per day or greater.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>County-wide Analysis</u>.</strong>  If rail activity in a specific county would exceed the Board's threshold for
environmental analysis, SEA estimated the change in emissions from these rail activities within the
county.  SEA used a phased approach to conduct this analysis as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>SEA estimated emissions increases on the rail line segments that would exceed the Board's
threshold for environmental analysis.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>SEA compared the estimated emissions increases with screening levels SEA developed
based on EPA emissions levels for stationary source permitting.  </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>If the estimated emissions increases exceeded the screening level, SEA conducted a more
detailed analysis that considered all potential Acquisition-related emissions changes (i.e.,
increases and decreases).</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA's analysis indicated that overall regional emissions would decrease
as a result of the proposed Acquisition; therefore SEA did not establish a criteria of significance for
regional air quality impacts.  For the County-wide analysis, SEA considered emissions to be
potentially significant if the total Acquisition-related emissions for a county exceeded 1.6 percent
of the total emissions inventory for that county.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Regional Results</u>.</strong>  SEA determined that the proposed Acquisition would result in an overall
regional decrease in emissions for all pollutants.  The estimated decrease in emissions would have
a beneficial effect on regional air quality.  SEA's revised estimate of regional air emissions is
presented in Table 2.8-1, "Summary of Regional Emissions Estimates."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>County-wide Results</u>.</strong>  SEA's County-wide analysis for the Draft EA showed that some counties
would experience emissions increases even though overall regional emissions would decrease. 
These County-wide increases exceeded SEA's emission screening levels for NO<sub>x</sub> in six counties in
Kansas.  To further evaluate the potential for a significant adverse effect on air quality, SEA
conducted a more detailed analysis of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, which included emissions estimates for all
Acquisition-related activity in each county.  In its detailed analysis, SEA determined that without
taking into account EPA's new emission standards for locomotives, estimated emissions increases
would be potentially significant for Atchison, Brown, Marshall, and Nemaha counties, when
compared with the existing level of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in these counties.  The remaining two
counties--Leavenworth and Wyandotte--would not exceed the level of potential significance for
NO<sub>x</sub>.  For the Final EA, SEA updated its County-wide analysis using the revised post-Acquisition
gross ton-mile estimates provided by UP.  Table 2.8-2, "NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions Changes for All
Acquisition-Related Emissions Sources by County," presents the results of SEA's revised analysis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA concluded that the combined Acquisition-related increases in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
for Atchison, Brown, Nemaha, and Marshall counties would be comparable to the annual level of
emissions from small stationary industrial sources.  SEA also concluded that the proposed
Acquisition would not significantly increase the total NO<sub>x</sub> emission inventories of these four
counties, relative to other counties in Kansas.  SEA has not changed its conclusion for the Final EA. 


<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA did not recommend mitigation of regional or County-wide emissions for the
following reasons:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>EPA's new emission standards for locomotives will effectively mitigate the level of
Acquisition-related NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in Atchison, Brown and Wyandotte Counties, beginning
in the year 2000.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>In Nemaha County, the new emissions standards for locomotives will reduce NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
by approximately 50%.  The remaining emissions (i.e., about 228 tons per year) are small,
in absolute terms, compared with other potential industrial sources of NO<sub>x</sub> and to the overall
emissions inventory of the region.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The proposed Acquisition would result in an overall reduction of emissions of air pollutants
on a regional basis. </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>For the Final EA, SEA reaffirms its conclusion that the proposed Acquisition would not adversely
affect air quality on a regional or County-wide basis because of the new emission standards.  In its
comments on the Draft EA, UP also volunteered to implement certain operating practices designed
to reduce locomotive fuel consumption and emissions.  SEA recommends that the Board require UP
to implement these voluntary operating practices.  (See Chapter 4, "Recommended Environmental
Conditions") This should further reduce emissions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.9	NOISE</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA evaluated potential increased noise for three rail line segments that exceeded
the Board's threshold for environmental analysis.  This section presents a summary of SEA's
analysis of potential noise effects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA quantified the number of sensitive receptors (such as schools, hospitals,
residences, and churches) that would experience noise levels above 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub><a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> before and after the
proposed Acquisition.  SEA based its noise analysis on baseline train operations, estimated post-Acquisition train activity, field noise measurements of typical UP coal trains, and site visits to count
potentially sensitive noise receptors.  SEA used a noise model developed by FRA to predict noise
levels at different distances from the rail line under a variety of operating conditions.  Section  3.7,
"Noise," of the Draft EA presents a detailed description of SEA's methods of analysis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Final EA, SEA continued to use the same noise analysis methods it had used for the Draft EA. 
SEA updated its analysis of potential noise effects to account for a change in estimated average train
length for coal trains on the affected rail line segments and an adjustment to the reference sound
level for the noise model.  SEA also reviewed its count of potentially sensitive noise receptors near
affected rail line segments and conducted additional consultation with the City of Seneca, based on
the City's comment that SEA undercounted the number of sensitive receptors in the City.  SEA
conducted additional noise analysis in Seneca to estimate the number of sensitive receptors that train
wayside noise would affect if Seneca had a train whistle ban area in place. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA considered Acquisition-related noise effects on a sensitive receptor
to be potentially significant if the post-Acquisition noise level was at least 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> and the
Acquisition-related increase in noise was at least 3 dBA L<sub>dn</sub>.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA identified three rail line segments in Kansas that exceeded the Board's
threshold for noise analysis.  SEA determined that approximately 1,483 noise sensitive receptors
would be in the post-Acquisition 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> contours for these three rail line segments, an increase
of 998 sensitive receptors from pre-Acquisition conditions.  Of the 1,483 sensitive receptors, SEA
determined that approximately 648 sensitive receptors located in 10 communities on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment would experience a post-Acquisition noise level of 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> or greater,
and an increase of 3 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> or greater.  SEA evaluated the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment for
noise mitigation. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Final EA, SEA determined that there would be 1,425 noise sensitive receptors in the post-Acquisition 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> contour and 648 sensitive receptors within the 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> contour that
would experience an increase of 3 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> or greater. All 648 sensitive receptors that would
experience a 3 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> or greater increase in noise are located on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line
segment. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Tables 2.9-1, "Increase in L<sub>dn</sub> and Distance to 65 dBA L<sub>dn</sub> Contour," and 2.9-2, "Noise Analysis
Results," present SEA's updated noise analysis for Acquisition-affected rail line segments.<strong><u></strong></u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA considered and compared several strategies to mitigate potential noise impacts. 
Some of these strategies mitigate train horn noise at highway/rail at-grade crossings by
implementing enhanced safety measures and eliminating the need to sound train horns.  These
strategies include upgraded warning devices at highway/rail at-grade crossings, closing highway/rail
at-grade crossings or constructing grade-separated crossings, constructing noise barriers, and
establishing train whistle ban areas within affected communities.  SEA ultimately concluded that the
forthcoming rulemaking by FRA to establish procedures for community train whistle ban areas
would be the most effective noise mitigation strategy for communities along the Hiawatha-Upland
rail corridor.  However, SEA did not recommend implementation of train whistle ban areas because
FRA has not issued these rules.  Rather, SEA recommended a condition requiring that UP consult 
with state and local officials in specified communities to find suitable approaches for mitigating
adverse noise effects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the Final EA, SEA has considered the comments submitted by the City of Seneca and UP
relating to noise.  The previously discussed MOU agreed to by the City, the NVPTA, and UP
addresses the noise issue in the City.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  The Final EA also retains (for communities other than Seneca)
the consultation condition proposed in the Draft EA.

<p><strong>2.10	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This section describes how SEA identified and evaluated the potential for disproportionately high
and adverse impacts on minority and low-income populations as a result of the proposed
Acquisition.  SEA conducted its analysis on three rail line segments that exceeded the Board's
thresholds for environmental analysis.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA developed a six-step process to analyze potential significant impacts on
minority and low-income populations from the proposed Acquisition.  SEA defined a population as
minority and low-income (i.e., an environmental justice population) within an area of potential effect
if the minority and low-income population exceeds 50 percent of the total population or if the
minority and low-income population is more than 10 percent of the county population.  After
identifying environmental justice populations, SEA evaluated whether Acquisition-related effects
would be high and adverse on these environmental justice populations. Using statistical methods, 
SEA determined whether potentially high and adverse effects could disproportionally affect the
environmental justice populations.  If SEA determined that there would be disproportionate impacts
on environmental justice populations, SEA evaluated potential mitigation strategies.  Section 3.8,
"Environmental Justice," of the Draft EA presents a detailed description of SEA's methods of
analysis. SEA's methods of analysis are unchanged from the Draft EA. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Criteria of Significance</u>.</strong>  SEA determined that potential environmental justice impacts would be
significant if the statistical analysis of disproportionate impact showed that environmental justice
and environmental resource variables are not independent and that environmental justice populations
would bear statistically significant disproportionate impacts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA evaluated a broad range of potential Acquisition-related environmental and
health effects for potential environmental justice impacts, including effects on safety, vehicle delay,
emergency vehicle response delay, energy, air quality, and noise.  SEA identified three rail line
segments in Kansas that would exceed the Board's thresholds for environmental analysis and have
environmental justice populations within the areas potentially affected by Acquisition-related rail
activities.  SEA concluded that noise and highway/rail at-grade crossing safety could result in
potential adverse environmental justice impacts, but only noise impacts would potentially affect an
environmental justice population.  SEA performed a statistical evaluation of potential adverse noise
impacts and concluded that these impacts would not disproportionately impact environmental justice
populations.  SEA did not revise its analysis of potential environmental justice effects in the Final
EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA concludes that the proposed Acquisition would not result in disproportionate high and adverse
impacts on minority or low-income populations and that mitigation measures to address
environmental justice are not warranted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.11	ACQUISITION-RELATED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP proposes to construct a new rail line connection that would join the UP and NEKM rail lines at
Hiawatha, Kansas. UP would construct the new rail line connection entirely within the existing
railroad right-of-way.  SEA reviewed the project's potential to individually or cumulatively affect
the environment beyond the existing right-of-way.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP would construct the proposed 820-foot connection between the UP rail line on the east and the
NEKM rail line on the west.  The connection would begin approximately 900 feet north of Miami
Street on the north side of Hiawatha, Kansas.  Approximately 375 feet of the connection would be
located within the Hiawatha city limits and the remainder located north of the city boundary.  UP
estimates that construction of the proposed connection would require approximately 6 weeks to
complete.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA also reviewed two alternatives to the proposed connection including: (1) a no-action where
UP's coal trains would continue to operate on their current routes between Kansas City, Kansas and
Gibbon, Nebraska; and (2) an alternative location for the proposed connection at the southern end
of Hiawatha, Kansas.  SEA concluded that neither the no-action nor build alternative were preferable
to the proposed connection at the northern end of Hiawatha, Kansas. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA reviewed the following issues to determine if construction of the proposed connection would
result in adverse environmental effects outside of the railroad right-of-way:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Surrounding land use. </li>
  <li>Natural resources, including potential effects on threatened or endangered species.</li>
  <li>Air quality.</li>
  <li>Noise. </li>
  <li>Disturbance of nearby hazardous waste sites.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Cultural resources.</li>
  <li>Construction or modification of highway/rail at-grade crossings. </li>
  <li>Environmental Justice.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>For its evaluation, SEA used a variety of information sources including U.S. Geological Survey
topographic maps, local zoning maps, aerial photographs, National Wetland Inventory maps, historic
meteorological data, and government environmental databases.  SEA also conducted a site visit.  As
part of this review, SEA consulted with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, Kansas
Department of Health and Environment, Kansas State Historic Preservation Office, and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Section 3.9, "Acquisition-related Construction Projects," of the Draft EA presents a detailed
description of SEA's methods.  SEA's methods of analysis in the Final EA are unchanged from the
Draft EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Analysis Results and Impacts</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA concluded that construction of the proposed connection at Hiawatha, Kansas
would not have potentially adverse environmental effects outside of the railroad right-of-way.  SEA
did not revise its analysis in the Final EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA did not identify potential adverse effects of construction outside of existing railroad right-of-way; therefore, mitigation is not warranted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.12	CUMULATIVE EFFECTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEPA guidelines require an assessment of potential cumulative effects of the proposed Acquisition. 
NEPA defines a cumulative effect as "the impact on the environment that results from the
incremental consequences of an action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions."<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  Although
certain actions may not directly relate to UP's proposed acquisition of the NEKM rail line, their
environmental effects, when added to or in interaction with the proposed Acquisition, constitute
cumulative effects that may be potentially adverse. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA evaluated activities that, when combined with the potential impacts of the proposed
Acquisition, could result in potentially adverse cumulative environmental impacts on air quality,
energy, and transportation systems.  SEA evaluated two types of activities that could result in
cumulative effects:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Regulations that agencies have approved but have not implemented as of publication of the
Final EA.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Other projects or activities, which potentially have cumulative effects, that agencies and the
public brought to SEA's attention during the public comment period.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p><strong>Agency Regulations</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA identified and analyzed a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
regulation for new standards for emissions from locomotives that EPA has approved but that has not
yet become effective for potential contributions to cumulative effects.  This rule will take effect in
the year 2000 and will ultimately result in more than a 60 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>)
emissions from locomotives.  SEA evaluated the potential cumulative effects of this new rule as part
of the review of potential mitigation alternatives for County-wide air quality effects of the proposed
Acquisition. (See Section 3.6.2, "County-wide Air Quality Analysis," of the Draft EA) SEA
concluded that the new rule would mitigate the level of Acquisition-related NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in
Atchison, Brown and Wyandotte counties and would reduce the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in Nemaha County
by about 50%.  SEA's analysis of potential cumulative effects from changes in agency regulations
is unchanged for the Final EA.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Public Input</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the Draft EA, SEA requested local communities; local, regional, state or Federal officials; or other
interested parties to provide information to the Board about potential projects or activities related
to the proposed Acquisition that may result in cumulative effects.  SEA did not receive any public
comment about specific projects or activities that could result in cumulative effects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.13	SEA'S CONCLUSIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based on its independent review of potential environmental effects that could result from the
proposed Acquisition, SEA has reached the following conclusions:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>On a regional basis, SEA identified several environmental benefits that would result from
overall improvement in UP's operating efficiency.  These benefits include reduced
emissions, reduced energy consumption, and reduced likelihood of mainline freight rail
accidents.  Of the 16 rail line segments that the proposed Acquisition would affect, 10 would
experience reduced train traffic and one would experience no change in train traffic.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>SEA identified potential adverse environmental effects in certain communities that would
experience increased train traffic as a result of the proposed Acquisition.  SEA identified
these potential effects in the areas of freight rail safety, highway/rail at-grade crossing safety,
noise, and County-wide emissions.  SEA identified reasonable and appropriate
environmental mitigation to address each of these issue areas in the affected communities.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>SEA also reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding UP entered into with the City of Seneca, and
the NVPTA regarding environmental issues associated with the transaction and now recommends
that the Board impose a condition requiring UP to comply with the terms of the MOU as an
alternative to any environmental mitigation for the City that the Board might otherwise impose.

<p align="center"><strong>CHAPTER 3</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>SUMMARY OF COMMENTS AND RESPONSES</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Chapter 3 summarizes the comments that SEA received on the Draft EA.  SEA issued the Draft EA
for public review and comment on December 21, 1998.  SEA encouraged all recipients and
reviewers to comment on its technical analyses and preliminary recommended mitigation measures
in the Draft EA.  The 30-day comment period expired on January 20, 1999.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA received a request from the City of Seneca, Kansas for an extension of the public comment
period so that the City could conduct a more detailed analysis of the Draft EA.  On the basis of
Seneca's request, SEA granted an extension until February 4, 1999 for filing supplemental
comments on the proposed Acquisition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SEA received a total of six comment documents on the Draft EA, as well as some telephone
inquiries and comments.  With the exception of UP, all the comments related solely to the City of
Seneca.  SEA received comments from the City of Seneca, the NVPTA, Sts. Peter and Paul School,
Union Pacific Railroad Company and private citizens in Seneca and Nemaha County affected by the
proposed Acquisition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As noted, shortly before this Final EA was prepared, Seneca, NVPTA, and UP jointly advised the 
Board that they had negotiated a mutually acceptable Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
executed March 12, 1999, addressing specific local environmental concerns regarding Seneca.  The
parties jointly asked that the Board impose a condition requiring UP to comply with the terms of the
MOU, as an alternative to any other environmental mitigation for Seneca that might otherwise be
imposed.  In view of the MOU, SEA in this Final EA also modified the local recommended
conditions in the Draft EA to eliminate Seneca from the list of communities for which the conditions
apply.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The MOU further indicates that, if the Board imposes a condition requiring UP to comply with the
terms of the MOU, the comments that the City and NVPTA filed on the Draft EA "will be deemed
to have been automatically withdrawn effective on the service date of the [Board's] order."  In these
circumstances, a detailed response to the comments regarding Seneca is unnecessary.  SEA will,
however, briefly set out below the nature of the concerns that were raised by the commenters
regarding Seneca.  It also should be noted that because the parties did not execute the MOU until late
in the environmental review process, SEA undertook further verification and analysis of data as a
result of the comments related to Seneca.  Also, in response to Seneca's concerns, SEA directed UP
to file a verified statement containing updated information on anticipated train traffic, train length,
and train speed.  As discussed below, SEA's further analysis based on the updated data shows that
the preliminary conclusions reached in the Draft EA remain valid because the new data were not
materially different from the data used in the Draft EA.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Finally, in addition to submitting a verified statement, UP filed comments proposing voluntary
mitigation that UP agreed to implement regarding highway/rail at-grade crossing safety and
emergency response for communities along the Hiawatha-Upland line.  UP's comment is described
below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3.1	COMMENTS RELATED TO SENECA</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In their comments on the Draft EA, the City of Seneca, NVPTA, the Sts. Peter and Paul School, and
private citizens in Seneca and Nemaha County argued that SEA should have done more to study
potential localized environmental impacts on Seneca (such as noise and emergency vehicle response
delay) and the Nemaha River and that the Draft EA had understated potential environmental impacts
on the City by using incorrect assumptions for potential train traffic, train speeds, and length of
trains.  In addition, the commenters questioned SEA's statistical approach for analyzing certain
environmental issue areas with potential impacts on Seneca, such as highway/rail at-grade crossing
safety, and asked for additional environmental mitigation for Seneca.  Seneca also asked that UP be
required to implement all mitigation conditions before its trains can use the NEKM rail line.  Two
private citizens who filed comments (James and Mary Jane Boding of Seneca) expressed concerns
that the proposed Acquisition would seriously affect the quality of life for residents living along the
right-of-way in Seneca.

<p>    

<p>	<strong><u>Response:</strong></u> SEA reviewed its technical analysis.  To respond to Seneca's concerns that the
Draft EA may have understated potential environmental impacts on Seneca by basing its
analysis on incorrect assumptions, SEA directed UP to provide a verified statement
providing additional information on estimated train traffic, average train speed, and average
train length over the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment, which UP did.  Based on SEA's
further analysis and UP's verified statement, SEA concludes that the 15 train per day average
increase over the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment used in the Draft EA was appropriate.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
SEA also believes it was reasonable to use a 35 mile per hour train speed for the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment, given the UP's verified statement explaining that UP has already
rehabilitated the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment to accommodate train speeds up to 40
miles per hour, and that there are no speed restrictions on that segment, including the bridge
over the Nemaha River.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the Draft EA, SEA used a 6,218 foot average train length for post-Acquisition train
operations on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.  The average train length was based
on a weighted average of 15 coal trains at approximately 6,569 feet each (i.e., an average
117-car trains) and one local train at approximately 950 feet. UP indicated in its verified
statement that its revised post-Acquisition coal train operations on the Hiawatha-Upland rail
line segment would consist of 127-car trains on average.  The revised coal train estimate is
due to UP's conversion of its coal trains to Distributed Power operation, which allows for
longer trains.  Therefore, for the Final EA, SEA used an average train length of 6,715 feet
on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  SEA notes that the train length estimate
primarily affects the analysis of highway/rail at-grade crossing delay, emergency vehicle
response delay, and predicted accident intervals on individual rail line segments.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  In the
Draft EA, SEA did not analyze any individual highway/rail at-grade crossings on the
Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment because there were no highway/rail at-grade crossings
with average daily traffic volume greater than 5,000 vehicles per day (the Board's threshold
for analysis of highway/rail at-grade crossing delay).  SEA used the revised average train
length in its general analysis of emergency response vehicle delay and freight rail operations
safety for individual rail line segments. (See Section 2.6, "Highway/Rail At-grade Crossing
Emergency Vehicle Response," and Section 2.3, "Freight Rail Operations Safety")

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3.2	HIGHWAY/RAIL AT-GRADE CROSSING SAFETY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to providing the requested verified statement, UP submitted comments volunteering to
implement the following additional mitigation to address potential highway/rail at-grade crossing
safety issues at communities along the Hiawatha-Upland rail line: (1)  install private crossing signs
and stop signs at all private highway/rail at-grade crossings that are open to public use; (2)  upgrade,
where necessary, all existing highway/rail at-grade crossing signal circuitry to accommodate the
proposed operation; (3)  post a visible emergency toll free 800 number at all highway/rail at-grade
crossings with active warning devices;  (4) provide toll free numbers to emergency response forces
in communities affected by the proposed Acquisition; (5) offer grade crossing collision investigation
classes and emergency response training to law enforcement agencies and first responders in
communities affected by the proposed Acquisition; and (6) implement vegetation control procedures
along the NEKM rail line.  SEA has included these items in its mitigation condition
recommendations in the Final EA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>UP also commented that it participated in a corridor review of all public highway/rail at-grade
crossings on the NEKM rail line, in conjunction with Kansas DOT and FRA.  UP explains that
Kansas DOT has submitted recommendations for highway/rail at-grade crossing signalization,
improvements or closure to communities along the NEKM rail line.  UP supports Kansas DOT's
recommendations and offered to work with affected communities, Kansas DOT and FRA in
implementing the recommendations.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u><strong>Response:</strong></u>  The recommended  highway/rail at-grade crossing safety mitigation in the Final
EA reflects the possibility that Kansas DOT may implement alternative safety improvements,
with the concurrence of UP and affected communities, based on the corridor-based analysis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>CHAPTER 4</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This Chapter describes the final mitigation measures SEA recommends that the Board impose as
environmental conditions for the proposed Acquisition. SEA developed these recommendations after
completing an independent analysis of the potential environmental effects.  SEA's analysis included
the following steps:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Careful and thorough review of all public comments, including the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) dated March 12, 1999, by UP, Seneca, and the NVPTA.</li>
  <li>Consultation with Federal and state agencies.</li>
  <li>Consideration of environmental and UP operating information.</li>
  <li>Site visits.</li>
  <li>Public notification activities.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>After careful analysis, SEA developed reasonable and practical environmental mitigation
recommendations to address potential adverse environmental effects.  The mitigation
recommendations fall within the scope of the Board's jurisdiction and are consistent with the
Board's practice of mitigating only those environmental effects that directly result from the proposed
Acquisition and giving effect to privately negotiated solutions whenever possible.  In addition, UP
volunteered to undertake several mitigation measures which are included in the Final EA to address
specific community concerns.  Throughout its environmental review process, SEA sought public
input.  SEA had to balance the various perspectives and concerns the public raised with the limits
of the Board's jurisdiction and the range of environmental effects and issues.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During the environmental review process, SEA encouraged UP to consult with potentially affected
communities to develop agreements to address special local environmental concerns related to
railroad operations.  These agreements often can be more effective and far reaching than the
environmental mitigation conditions the Board may impose unilaterally.  As of the publication of
this Final EA, UP has executed a negotiated agreement with Seneca and the NVPTA.  The parties
have asked that the Board impose a condition requiring that UP comply with the terms of the March
12, 1999 MOU in lieu of any other environmental mitigation conditions that might otherwise be
imposed relating to UP operations through Seneca.  SEA has reviewed the MOU and recommends
that the requested condition be imposed.  Therefore, SEA has modified the local environmental
conditions it recommended in the Draft EA to eliminate Seneca from the list of affected
communities.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If UP and an affected community complete a negotiated agreement after SEA issues the Final EA,
SEA further recommends that the terms of those agreements be deemed an acceptable alternative 
for any local and site-specific mitigation that the Board would otherwise impose.  To the extent that
a negotiated agreement is inconsistent or incompatible with a SEA recommended condition, SEA
recommends that the SEA condition prevail.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based on its independent environmental analysis and review of all public comments, SEA
recommends that the Board require UP to implement the following environmental mitigation
measures as conditions in any decision approving the proposed Acquisition.  SEA concludes that,
with these mitigation measures, the proposed Acquisition would not result in adverse environmental
effects on the natural or human environment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Safety:  Freight Rail Operations</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 1</u>.</strong>  UP shall comply with the requirements in the Federal Railroad Administration's
(FRA) Proposed Rule for "gross ton-mile based" inspections (49 CFR Part 213.237, Docket No.
RST-90-1) on the following rail line segments in Kansas:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Kansas City-Atchison.</li>
  <li>Atchison-Hiawatha.</li>
  <li>Hiawatha-Upland.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>FRA's Proposed Rule includes a provision that specifically requires railroads to conduct track
inspections to detect rail flaws on a rail line segment at least once every 40 million gross tons per
track mile or annually, whichever is more frequent.  If FRA's Final Rule imposes a different
inspection standard, then UP shall comply with the standard in the Final Rule.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Safety:  Highway/Rail At-grade Crossings</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 2</strong></u>.  UP shall continue its consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),
the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) and the communities along the Hiawatha-Upland
corridor to implement the recommendations of the Corridor Review Team composed of UP, FRA,
and KDOT.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 3</strong></u>.  Subject to any agreement reached in ongoing consultations pursuant to Condition 2,
UP shall upgrade the highway/rail at-grade crossing warning device at 6<sup>th</sup> Street in Sabetha, Kansas 
from crossbucks to flashing lights. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 4</strong></u>.  As agreed to by UP, UP shall undertake the following measures:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>UP will provide Operation Lifesaver programs in the future as requested by
communities on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will install UP's standard private crossing signs and stop signs at all private
highway/rail at-grade crossings which are open to public use.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>UP will upgrade, where necessary, all existing highway/rail at-grade crossing signal
circuitry to accommodate the proposed rail operations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>At all highway/rail at-grade crossings with active warning devices, UP will post a
visible emergency toll free 800 number to be called if signal crossing devices
malfunction.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will provide toll free numbers to all emergency response forces in communities
affected by the proposed Acquisition.  These numbers will provide access to
appropriate UP personnel who may be contacted by communities in emergency
situations.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>UP will offer Grade Crossing Collision Investigation classes and emergency response
training to law enforcement agencies and first responders in affected communities.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    <li>To enhance highway/rail at-grade crossing safety, UP will undertake vegetation
control procedures along the Hiawatha-Upland corridor.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  </ol>
</ol>

<p><strong>Noise</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 5</u>.</strong>  UP shall consult with state and local officials to find suitable approaches for
mitigating the adverse noise effects in the following communities on the Hiawatha-Upland rail line
segment in Kansas:   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>Hamlin</li>
  <li>Morrill</li>
  <li>Sabetha</li>
  <li>Oneida</li>
  <li>Baileyville</li>
  <li>Axtell</li>
  <li>Beattie</li>
  <li>Home</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ol>

<p>Mitigation for a specific community may include a combination of:  (1) eliminating highway/rail at-grade crossings, (2) installing safety measures that meet future FRA requirements for no-horn quiet
zones, or (3) other measures as UP and affected community may negotiate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Negotiated Agreement</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 6</strong></u>.  UP shall comply with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, dated March
12, 1999, executed by the UP, City of Seneca, Kansas, and the Nemaha Valley Parent Teachers
Association, regarding local environmental issues associated with this transaction.

<p><strong>Air Quality</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Condition 7</strong></u>.  As agreed to by UP, the UP will use operating practices that are designed to reduce
locomotive fuel consumption and emissions.  These include throttle modulation, use of dynamic
braking, increased use of pacing and coasting trains and isolating unneeded horsepower.

<p><strong>Monitoring and Enforcement Condition</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Condition 8</u>.</strong>  If  there is a material change in the facts or circumstances upon which the Board relied
in imposing specific environmental mitigation conditions in this Decision, and upon petition by any
party who demonstrates such material changes, the Board may review the continuing applicability
of its final mitigation, if warranted.

the following day, the train makes a round trip between Marysville, Kansas and Hiawatha, Kansas.
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>	A dBA is an A-weighted decibel, a single-number measure of sound intensity that accounts for the various
frequency components in a way that approximates human hearing.  L<sub>dn</sub> is the day-night average noise level,
which is the receptor's cumulative noise exposure from all noise events over a 24 hour period, adjusted to
account for the perception that a noise event at night is more bothersome  than the same noise during the day. 
<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>	UP will install continuous welded rail within the City during 1999.  The City and UP have agreed to develop
a "Quiet Zone" and a program of closing highway/rail at-grade crossings (to be selected by the City).

<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>	UP stated in its verified statement that the capacity of this rail line segment is limited because of the need to
maintain local train service and to provide time for maintenance work on the rail line.  In addition, UP would
operate this rail line segment under Track Warrant Control, which is a time-consuming dispatching method
that limits track capacity.
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>	The average train length of 6,715 feet is based on an average 15 coal trains at 7,100 feet each and one local
train at 950 feet.
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>	Train length indirectly affects the analysis of air quality and energy, which are based on changes in train
tonnages.  A change in average train length also has a slight affect on wayside noise effects, but Acquisition-related noise effects along the Hiawatha-Upland rail line segment are mainly a factor of train horns.
