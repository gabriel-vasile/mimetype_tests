      <table width="650" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="386" valign="top"> 
            <p class="pgph">Here is the twist. We always preach that the more 
              experience we gain the better we are able to handle every situation. 
              More experienced pilots will see the problems sooner, handle the 
              situation better. The more experienced flight lead will be better 
              at controlling all the different aspects of the mission, will be 
              more flexible when things change, and -- on the whole -- will have 
              higher Situational Awareness (SA) than a less experienced aviator. 
              How can this same blessed experience be the creator of lower SA? 
            </p>
            <p class="pgph">As with any equation we should start by defining the 
              variables. Experience (Ex) we can simply call the amount of time 
              a pilot has in doing a particular task or set of tasks. The more 
              a pilot has done things, the higher his experience. SA is not quite 
              so simple. </p>
            <p class="pgph">An official definition of SA is &quot;a continuous 
              perception of self and aircraft in relation to the dynamic environment 
              of flight, threats, and mission, and the ability to forecast, then 
              execute those tasks based on perception.&quot; Doesn't mean much 
              to me. Another definition provided by Crew Training International 
              is a little easier for me to grasp. SA is &quot;an accurate perception 
              of what has happened, what is happening, and what might happen.&quot; 
              We will define that as the level of correct knowledge the pilot 
              has about everything going on in and around his aircraft, his fight, 
              and his mission. Obviously, one can have a high (Hi) or a low (Lo) 
              level of both Ex and SA. </p>
            <p class="pgph">It seems at first look that the equation Hi (Ex) = 
              Lo (SA) is completely wrong. After all, how can past experience 
              and in-depth knowledge of the task at hand actually lower our understanding 
              of our surroundings? After all, we should strive for having experienced 
              it all (knowing what happened), being able to adjust to the situation 
              as it changes (knowing what is happening), and being able to know 
              what will happen (having seen it before). Ultimate SA based on Hi 
              Ex. So, how can Hi Ex cause us to lose SA? Let's look at how we 
              can lose our SA. <br>
              Well,there's Alzheimer's or a concussion where a medical condition 
              causes the loss of memory (and the loss of the &quot;what has happened&quot;). 
              This part of the equation can be affected in other ways as well: 
              being over tasked, getting behind the jet, or just not receiving 
              the information to build a picture of what has actually happened. 
              But once again, it appears that more experience only helps minimize 
              the effects of all these (even with Alzheimer's you would have more 
              to forget before the slate is clean). No link here. </p>
            <p class="pgph">That leaves knowing what is happening and what is 
              going to happen. What is most likely to cause us to incorrectly 
              assess these areas? The list here is endless so let's limit it to 
              the ones that are cited most often: distraction, channelized attention, 
              task saturation, complacency, insufficient preparation, or limited 
              proficiency. But, once again most of these are areas that actually 
              improve with greater experience. And each of these is effectively 
              combated through gaining more experience. Not boding well for the 
              proof. </p>
            <p class="pgph">But one of these factors just might hold the key: 
              complacency. The simplest definition is &quot;self-satisfaction.&quot; 
              We've all heard stories of pilots who got complacent (or we've been 
              there first hand). Most can relate to the pilot that relaxed during 
              a mission only to have something pop up and destroy the moment of 
              calm. These moments occur in every phase of the mission: the pilot, 
              who has delivered the greatest brief, becomes so focused on the 
              flight that he walks by his aircraft on the ramp; the aviator, who 
              has launched 200 times from the same runway in military power, doesn't 
              remember to use afterburner on an exercise launch with three external 
              tanks; the G-awareness turn where nobody looks to deconflict flight 
              paths; the air combat maneuver engagements where everyone knows 
              where the others are suppose to be so no one confirms locations 
              with a look or radio call; the recovery where the lead's navigation 
              aids are bad and no one else notices; the landing approach that 
              looked good until the belly (instead of the gear) hits the concrete; 
              or pulling in to park in the space you left from and not confirming 
              the wingtip is clear. Sometimes these are tragic moments. Sometimes 
              they are just private reminders of the nature of the beast. But 
              all of them may have had the same simple beginning: too much experience! 
            </p>
            <p class="pgph">Hard to believe? Well, let's look at the root causes 
              of complacency: simplicity and familiarity. Both of these set pilots 
              up for becoming complacent. Simplicity is the result of learning 
              a task so well that no thought or concern is put forward to complete 
              it. The best way to learn a task is repetition and rehearsal (building 
              experience). Familiarity comes from continued exposure to the same 
              task (local area procedures, standard setups, etc.). Familiarity 
              is also a result of experience. The inexperienced pilot may make 
              the same errors with the same resulting loss of SA, but NOT as a 
              result of complacency. Their errors are a combination of the other 
              factors, but not because they were comfortable and satisfied with 
              the task at hand. Most are entirely too busy to let down their guard. 
            </p>
            <p class="pgph">The experienced pilot is not so lucky. As his experience 
              builds, his comfort level increases in everything he does. Just 
              try flying low altitude for a while and see how comfortable you 
              feel &quot;climbing up&quot; to 1,500 feet above the ground. It 
              will make you question why you felt threatened stopping your engaged 
              maneuvering at 5,000 feet. It's all a result of increased experience. 
              And with the increased proficiency, comes comfort and opportunities 
              to relax ... the result is complacency. Your attention drifts from 
              the task at hand (flying/fighting/returning) and your knowledge 
              of what is happening and what is going to happen starts to wane. 
              And with it goes your level of SA. Every piece of the situation 
              that you miss, ignore, or assume just drops the SA level lower. 
            </p>
            <p class="pgph">As a direct result of your higher experience (Hi Ex), 
              complacency could become a factor, and the result (=) is a decline 
              in the level of SA (Lo SA). So the equation would be: </p>
            <p class="pgph">Hi (Ex) x Complacency = Lo (SA) Don't let your experience 
              work against you. If you feel relaxed, you may be missing something 
              you shouldn't.</p>
