MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE WILL BE TIMING ON PRECIPITATION. MAXIMUM                
TEMPERATURES STILL RUNNING SLIGHTLY BELOW EARLY SEPTEMBER AVERAGES.             
CURRENTLY...SOMEWHAT FLATTER MIDDLE AND UPPER LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW               
OVER THE CENTRAL ROCKIES THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON PER WATER             
VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC MODEL UPPER AIR ANALYSES. THE RUC H5-H3 LAYER             
VORTICITY DATA SHOWED A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ALONG THE WY/CO                 
BORDER AND ANOTHER WAY BACK OVER NV. NO PRECIPITATING WEATHER THIS              
MORNING AND THE WRF MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPING PRECIPITATION TOO                 
EARLY. VIS AND IR SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING CU AND TOWERING CU                  
DEVELOPING OVER THE MOUNTAINS...ESPECIALLY THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE               
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW SHOWERS ARE BREAKING OUT OVER CENTRAL               
MOUNTAINS...BUT NOT MUCH DEVELOPING OVER OUR EASTERN MOUNTAINS EARLY            
THIS AFTERNOON. CAPPING INVERSION STILL KEEPING TOWERING CU AND CB              
DEVELOPMENT AT MINIMUM EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. REGIONAL RADAR SHOWING             
A LINE OF SHRA/TSRA FORMING OVER PALMER DIVIDE AND HAS GONE SEVERE              
JUST IN EL PASO COUNTY. THIS IS CLOSER TO THE MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE AND            
SOUTHWARD EXTENDING CYCLONIC SHEAR AXIS PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.                
LATE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING STRATUS/FOG DISSIPATED ACROSS THE SAN              
LUIS VALLEY AND MUCH OF SOUTHEASTERN CO BY MIDMORNING.                          
TONIGHT...MIDDLE AND UPPER LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW TO CONTINUE AND IT IS            
DIFFICULT TO LATCH ONTO ANY SIGNIFICANT MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TO                   
ENHANCE CONVECTION. WILL LIKELY SEE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS               
AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND              
HIGH VALLEYS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND MOVE TOWARDS THE EAST THIS                 
EVENING. JUST CANNOT JUSTIFY THE 12KM WRF HANGING ONTO PRECIPITATION            
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE CWFA AFTER MIDNIGHT...EXCEPT MAYBE THE FAR               
SOUTHEASTERN CO DUE TO SOME ROGUE THUNDERSTORM OUTFLOW                          
BOUNDARY...BUT THAT MIGHT BE A STRETCH. WILL MAINTAIN ISOLATED TO               
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWFA               
WITH THE HIGHEST POPS/WX ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGH VALLEYS. MUCH            
OF THE PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL SHOULD BE OVER AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE             
CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS DISSIPATE. THERE MIGHT BE SOME THIN HIGH               
CLOUDS MOVING OVERHEAD LATE. A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT ANOTHER ROUND             
OF STRATUS/FOG ACROSS THE SAN LUIS VALLEY AND SOUTHEASTERN CO                   
PLAINS. 12KM WRF IS NOT AS MOIST NEAR THE SURFACE AS WITH LATE LAST             
NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING. TOUGH CALL AND WILL MAKE IT AT PRESS              
TIME. IF IT RAINS IN THE SAN LUIS VALLEY...THEN THE NIGHTTIME                   
SFC-PBL COULD MOISTEN WITH LIFR/IFR STRATUS/FOG CONDITIONS. A WEAK              
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH SOUTHEASTERN CO LATE TONIGHT. THERE IS SOME            
HINT OF SFC-PBL MOISTENING BEHIND THE WEAK FRONT TO SUPPORT                     
STRATUS/FOG DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS SUNRISE.                                        
SUNDAY...AGAIN...12KM WRF IS LIKELY DEVELOPING PRECIPITATION TOO                
EARLY(E.G. MORNING)...ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHEASTERN CO. AGAIN...TOUGH              
TO CONCENTRATE ON ANY SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN THE MODELS TO             
ENHANCE CONVECTION ON SUNDAY. DISSIPATING WEAK COLD FRONT IN                    
SOUTHEASTERN CO WILL LIKELY TRANSITION TO EASTERLY UPSLOPE                      
FLOW...MOUNTAIN-PLAINS CIRCULATION...ACROSS I-25 CORRIDOR AND                   
EASTWARD. THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY KNOCK A FEW DEGREES OF THE                        
TEMPERATURE...UNLESS DEEPER MIXING CAN OCCUR. GETTING CLOSE AND INTO            
FALL...SO GETTING TOUGHER FOR SOUTHEAST CO TO MIX AND WARMUP...SO               
MOS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO WARM. IF IT REMAINS COOLER...THEN LOW                 
LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION WOULD KEEP SURFACE-BASED SHRA/TSRA FROM                 
FORMING SUNDAY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER... ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA            
COULD FORM OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND DRIFT EASTWARD GIVEN THE WESTERLY             
MEAN LAYER FLOW. METZE

(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)                                                 
SUNDAY NIGHT-MONDAY...LATEST MODELS COMING CLOSER TOGETHER WITH                 
DEVELOPING NORTH TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE REGION AS                   
BROAD UPPER LOW/TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND                
INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST THROUGH TUESDAY. PASSING SYSTEM SENDS A RE               
ENFORCING SURGE OF COOL AIR ACROSS THE EASTERN PLAINS LATE SUNDAY               
NIGHT WITH COOL UPSLOPE FLOW EXPECTED ON MONDAY. WITH NORTH TO                  
NORTHEAST SFC-H7 FLOW ACROSS THE PLAINS AND WEAK QG IMPLIED ASCENT              
PROGGED ACROSS THE REGION...HAVE INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE FAVORED              
EASTERN TERRAIN SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. HAVE ALSO LEANED CLOSER                
TO THE COOLER NAM GUIDANCE FOR MONDAY...KEEPING THE FAR EASTERN

SOMEWHAT ACTIVE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WITH WEAK SHORTWAVES MOVING                    
THROUGH THE AREA IN RATHER LIGHT WESTERLIES. AT THE SFC...HIGH                  
PRESSURE ANCHORED NORTHEAST OF THE AREA PRODUCING SOME NORTHEAST                
FLOW OVER THE COASTAL WATERS AND INTO NORTHEAST FLORIDA AND                     
SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. PRETTY GOOD BLOWUP OF CONVECTION SEEN WELL                   
OFFSHORE ASSOCIATED WITH EXITING SHORTWAVE. SCATTERED WEAKER

06Z GFS IS VERY AGRESSIVE BRINGING A SHORWAVE FROM THE NE GULF                  
ACROSS THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON WITH ANOTHER FOLLOWING OVERNIGHT.                 
RUC AND 00Z NAM ARE MUCH LESS AGRESSIVE WITH THESE SHORTWAVES. RUC              
ANALYSIS AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ARE MUCH MORE SUPPORTED OF THE                 
WEAKER SOLUTIONS. THUS WITH NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW...EXPECT BEST              
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER SOUTHWESTERN CWA THIS AFTERNOON. 0-6KM              
FLOW IS VERY LIGHT SO EXPECT SLOW MOVEMENT WITH THE CONVECTION AND              
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE. COASTAL NE FLORIDA MAY SEE A FEW               
LOW TOPPED SHOWERS THROUGH THE REST OF THE MORNING BUT WILL LIKELY              
DRY OUT SOME THIS AFTERNOON WITH ONLY ISOLATED STORMS. TEMPS

LOOKING AT VIS SAT...FOG LOCATED ALONG WATERWAYS...AREAS WITH RECENT            
PRECIP AND NEAR VALLEYS LOCATIONS WAS BURNING OFF QUICKLY.                      
THUNDERSHOWER ACTIVITY HAD LESSENED FROM ITS ALREADY ISOLATED NATURE            
AS OF 930 AM. LITTLE VORT ROLLING ACROSS TENNESSEE HELPING TO FIRE              
UP THE ACTIVITY EARLIER THIS MORNING...AND IT SHOULD REDEVELOP AGAIN            
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS                    
AFTERNOON DUE TO HEATING CREATING AMPLE INSTABILITY...LIS NEARING -3            
TO -5 AND CAPES AROUND 1500-2000 J/KG. AS MENTIONED EARLIER...DRIER             
AIR ALOFT MAY ALLOW FOR GUSTY WINDS IN STORMS...AND SMALL HAIL AND              
HEAVY RAIN MAY BE AN ISSUE AS WELL...THOUGH COVERAGE WILL BE LESS               
THAN 20 PERCENT OF THE AREA TO SEE ANY RAINFALL TODAY. ANY STORMS               
THAT DEVELOP SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF A LINE FROM RICHMOND TO                     
HODGENVILLE TO MORGANTOWN.                                                      
ONE THING OF NOTE...THE 12Z RUN OF THE RUC SHOWS THE TN VORT SLIDING            
INTO EASTERN TN BY LATE AFTERNOON...SO THINKING THAT THE                        
SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA  (LAKE CUMBERLAND/DALE HOLLOW                 
AREAS) WILL HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF A STORM THIS AFTERNOON AS                  
WARMER MID LEVEL TEMPS MOVING INTO THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA             
DURING THE AFTERNOON MAY PROVIDE FOR SOME SLIGHT CAPPING TO THE                 
CONVECTION. HOURLY TEMPS LOOK GOOD SO FAR...ALL WITHIN A DEGREE OR              
SO...WILL NOT MAKE MUCH IF ANY SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT HERE...THOUGH             
LEX IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN BOTH SDF/BWG AS OF 10 AM. A FEW TO SCTD             
CU WILL DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON...LESSER COVERAGE AS YOU MOVE

SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...                                               
MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE WILL BE CHANCE...IF ANY...OF THUNDERSTORMS              
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. GFS SHOWS A WEAK SURFACE TROF ACROSS THE            
OHIO VALLEY WITH HUMIDITY INCREASING AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF HIGH                
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE APPALACHIANS. NAM12 DEVELOPS SHOWERS AND             
THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON OVER SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AS LIFTED             
INDEX BOTTOMS OUT AROUND -3 WITH MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES OF 6.5 DEG               
C/KM /THOUGH MORNING CIRRUS MAY PREVENT FULL DESTABILIZATION/.                  
GFS...THOUGH OVERDONE IN AREAL COVERAGE AS IS TYPICAL OF THE                    
MODEL...AGREES AND PRODUCES QPF ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SPC HAS               
GENERAL THUNDER AREA ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES AND MOS               
POPS ARE GENERALLY IN THE 20S. NAM12 SHOWS A 850HPA THETA-E RIDGE               
OVER THE SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. ATMOSPHERE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT TODAY              
THAN YESTERDAY...WHEN WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED.                 
SO...WILL INTRODUCE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE FORECAST TODAY              
OVER THE SOUTH. STORMS YESTERDAY PRODUCED RAINFALL RATES UP TO AN               
INCH PER HOUR AND WE RECEIVED A FEW REPORTS OF WIND DAMAGE AND SMALL            
HAIL. LOOKING AT TODAY...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE AROUND 1.5               
INCHES AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHT WILL BE AROUND 9500 FEET SO A                   
LOCALLY HEAVY DOWNPOUR AND A LITTLE SMALL HAIL WILL BE POSSIBLE IN              
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION. STORM MOTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ONLY AROUND            
10MPH...ADDING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. FORECAST               
SOUNDINGS SHOW A DECENT DRY LAYER AT 12000 TO 16000 FEET ABOVE A                
MOIST CLOUD-BEARING LAYER THIS AFTERNOON. THOUGH MDPI ONLY PEAKS

CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN AS IT CONTINUES TO MARCH EAST. THIS IS                   
SUPPORTED BY THE 09/18Z RUC AND THE 29/12Z GFS...RGEM AND NAM. THE              
DISSIPATION OF THE CUMULUS CLOUDS IN THE VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES             
ALSO NOT BODING WELL FOR STRONG CONVECTION ACROSS EASTERN MA AND MOST           
OF RI. THE LIMITING FACTOR IS THE RELATIVELY DRY AIR IN THE 900-750             
MB LAYER.

I UPDATED THE ZONES FOR MORE CLOUDS TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. I ALSO ADDED            
SHOWERS TO SOUTHWEST LOWER SECTION OF THE ZONES THIS AFTERNOON.                 
LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WERE INCREASED 5 TO 8F OVER THE SOUTHERN               
AND CENTRAL CWA DUE TO THE CLOUDS HOLDING IN PLUS I DECREASED THE               
FORECAST HIGH SUNDAY FOR THE SAME REASON.                                       
ALL OF THIS IS BASED ON THE NEAR STATIONARY 850 MB FRONT NEAR                   
INTERSTATE 96 TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. THERE IS THE ADDED BONUS OF               
MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE BEING ADVECTED IN FROM THE DOWNSTREAM               
LOW AND MID LEVEL INFLOW RUNNING INTO THE SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY              
AND BEING LIFTED OVER IT THEN ADVECTED EASTWARD DOWNSTREAM TOWARD               
SOUTHWEST LOWER MICHIGAN. IT IS MY CONTENTION THE LOW CLOUDS WILL               
HOLD SOLIDLY OVER THE SOUTHWEST CWA THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.  THE WATER            
VAPOR LOOPS SHOW WHAT THE 00Z NAM AND RUC SUGGEST... WHICH IS THAT              
DOWN STREAM LOW AND MID LEVEL MOISTURE INFLOW IS NOW MOVING INTO                
SOUTHWEST LOWER MICHIGAN AND WITH THE AID OF JET INFLOW REGION LIFT             
WILL RESULT IN THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS SUNDAY DURING THE DAY FROM GRR             
WEST TO THE LAKE SHORE. WHILE THE ISENTROPIC LIFT IS NOT ALL THAT               
GREAT THERE IS DECENT FGEN FORCING NEAR 850 MB THROUGH MOST OF THE              
DAY SUNDAY FROM RQB SOUTH TO SBN. THAT COUPLED WITH THE INCREASE IN             
MID LEVEL MOISTURE AND THE INCREASE TO TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE...THAT             
IS PWAT VALUES RISE FROM NEAR 1 INCH AT 00Z OVER GRR TO NEAR 1.3                
INCHES BY LATE AFTERNOON... I BELIEVE THERE IS AT LEAST A CHANCE OF             
SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHWEST SECTIONS OF LOWER                    
MICHIGAN AND LITTLE CHANCE OF MUCH CLEARING.

UNDERNEATH 800-850 MB INVERSION AS NOTED ON 12Z CWPL AND KINL SNDGS.            
LACK OF CLOUDS AND RIDGING OVER FCST AREA WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A

AN UPPER LOW FORMING OVER SRN MN IN MON TO TUE TIME FRAME. THESE

TROPICAL STORM FLORENCE MOVING UP THE ATLANTIC COAST AND CAUSING A              
BLOCK IN MID-UPR FLOW PATTERN. BELIEVE GFS/UKMET MAY BE ON TO                   
SOMETHING AND CANNOT SIMPLY DISCOUNT THEIR SOLUTIONS...ALTHOUGH IT IS           
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THEY MAY BE TOO AGGRESSIVE BRINGING SYSTEM SO FAR

HIGH PRESSURE JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR EMBEDDED UNDER NORTHWEST              
FLOW ALOFT.  LAST NIGHTS SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED SOUTH OVER               
IA/IL/SOUTHERN MI/AND THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES...WHILE THE 850MB                 
FRONT CONTINUES TO HANG ACROSS CENTRAL MI.  MOST OF THE DEEPER CLOUD            
COVER REMAINS ALONG THIS FRONT JUST SOUTH OF A KMBL TO KOSC LINE.               
500MB SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO DIVE SOUTHWARD WITH THE LEADING EDGE               
SOUTH OF THE STRAITS.  MUCH DRIER AIR RESIDES TO THE NORTH AS                   
EVIDENT BY THE MOSTLY CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.  12Z APX SOUNDING              
SHOWS LOW LEVEL NE FLOW AND A STRONG INVERSION IN PLACE AT 850MB.               
WITH TEMPS AT THIS LEVEL AT 3C AND 19-20C LAKE TEMPS...STRONG LOW               
LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE PROMOTING LAKE EFFECT STRATOCU BANDS ACROSS               
MOST OF NORTHERN LOWER...WHILE DOWNSLOPING OFF OF THE ONTARIO                   
PLATEAU HAS KEPT EASTERN UPPER MOSTLY CLEAR.  A FEW SHRA SHOWING UP             
ON THE OBS ACROSS THE SE CWA WHERE THE LARGEST Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE             
IS IN PLACE.  MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THIS AFTERNOON CONTINUES TO            
BE THE CHANCE OF DRIZZLE AND/OR LIGHT SHOWERS.                                  
BASED MOSTLY ON THE 12Z APX SOUNDING...GFS LOOKS LIKE THE MOST                  
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MODELS...AND HAVE FOLLOWED ITS GUIDANCE MORE              
CLOSELY.  THE 500MB SHORTWAVE IS PROGGED TO EXIT THE CWA THIS                   
AFTERNOON.  EVEN THOUGH PLENTY OF INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN OVER THE              
LAKE WITH 850 TEMPS HOLDING STEADY AT 3-5C...BELIEVE INCREASING                 
SUBSIDENCE AND DECREASING UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL PREVENT ANY                  
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT MID TO LATE AFTERNOON.  THEREFORE...WILL KEEP THE            
FORECAST INTACT...WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ENDING AT 18Z.  SURFACE              
HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY SLIDE TO THE SE TODAY AS THE 850MB FRONT              
MOVES TO THE SOUTH.  THEREFORE...ANTICYCLONIC LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL               
INCREASE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND A CLEARING TREND WILL TAKE PLACE              
FROM NW TO SE AS DRIER AIR MIXES OUT THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  HOW               
MUCH CLEARING IS HARD TO SAY.  BELIEVE WITH THE FRESH SUPPLY OF LOW             
LEVEL MOISTURE FROM LAKE HURON AND UPSLOPE FLOW COMBINED WITH THE               
SYNOPTIC MOISTURE FROM THE UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY              
CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON FROM PRESQUE ISLE TO MANISTEE WHILE SKIES WILL            
BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY NORTH OF THAT LINE.  EASTERN UPPER LOOKS TO

SEVERAL STATIONS DROPPING INTO THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S DESPITE THE

CONCERNS CENTERED AROUND PRECIPITATION CHANCES IN SOUTHERN ZONES

AFOREMENTIONED ONTARIO HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE                
REGION. BIG CONCERN EARLY ON IS WHAT TO DO WITH LINGERING SHOWERS               
THIS MORNING IN SOUTHERN ZONES. PRECIPITATION WILL GRADUALLY                    
DECREASE THIS MORNING AS 850MB FRONT PUSHES SOUTH AND MID LEVEL                 
DYNAMICS ADVANCE EAST WITH SHORTWAVE. WILL HAVE SCATTERED WORDING               
FOR SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES THROUGH THIS MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR               
ANY LINGERING ACTIVITY. ELSEWHERE...LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE AND                  
DRYING IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA. NAM-WRF            
POINT MODEL SOUNDINGS SUPPORT FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DRIZZLE                  
FORMATION THIS MORNING FOR THE MUCH OF THE REMAINING AREAS OF THE               
NORTHERN LOWER AS STRENGTHENING SUBSIDENCE INVERSION CAPS SATURATED             
SURFACE TO 900MB LAYER. SAME PROFILE ALSO SUPPORTS CLOUDY CONDITIONS            
FOR THE MORNING HOURS AS SUFFICIENT MIXING WILL NOT OCCUR TO SCOUR              
OUT THE CLOUDS. ONE EXCEPTION IS THE EXTREME EASTERN UPPER AS                   
DOWNSLOPING NORTHEAST FLOW OUT OF ONTARIO HAS ERODED THE LOW                    
OVERCAST. BY THIS AFTERNOON...BOUNDARY LAYER DRYING OVER THE TIP OF             
THE MITT AND REMAINING AREAS OF THE EASTER UPPER WILL HELP BREAK UP             
THE OVERCAST. CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ZONES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY AS LOW              
LEVEL DRYING WILL BE A SLOW TO WORK SOUTH. ADDITIONAL LOW LEVEL                 
MOISTURE WILL BE PROVIDED FROM NORTHEAST WINDS OFF OF LAKE HURON AS             
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION LOWERS 900 MB TEMPERATURES TO AROUND +3C              
BY 21Z. WITH WATER TEMPERATURES STILL UP AROUND 19C THIS GENERATES              
LAKE-900 MB DELTA T/S OF 16C. NOT CONCERNED WITH LAKE EFFECT RAIN               
SHOWERS AS STRONG INVERSION WILL PREVENT SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE                 
GROWTH. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE STUCK GENERALLY IN THE 50S WITH              
CONTINUED CAA AND LACK OF SOLAR INSOLATION.                                     
TONIGHT...BOUNDARY LAYER DRYING CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT.            
EXPECT SKIES TO BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY AWAY FROM NORTHEAST WIND LAKE            
EFFECT REGIONS WHERE NORTHEAST FLOW COUPLED WITH DELTA T/S REMAINING            
IN THE MID TO UPPER TEENS SHOULD KEEP LAKE CLOUDS SPREADING ONSHORE.            
LAKE INDUCED BOUNDARY LAYER DOES INCREASE TONIGHT TO AROUND 850 MB              
BUT STILL NOT SUFFICIENT FOR SHOWER GENERATION. TEMPERATURES A                  
BIGGER CONCERN WITH READINGS EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE MID 30S IN               
THE TYPICAL COOLER INTERIOR REGIONS TO AROUND 40 NEAR THE LAKES.                
LIKE PREVIOUS FORECASTER MENTIONED...DO NOT THINK FROST WILL BECOME             
WIDESPREAD AS WINDS DO NOT TOTALLY DECOUPLE AND SOME LAKE CLOUDS                
LINGER OVER THE AREA. WILL THEREFORE KEEP PATCHY FROST WORDING IN               
GRIDS.                                                                          
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...DRY AND COOL WEATHER ACROSS THE AREA AS

OVER ALONG AND EAST OF I-75 WITH LAKE CLOUDS STREAMING IN OFF LAKE              
HURON IN LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW. A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE SHOULD HELP                
TEMPERATURE WARM BY A DEGREE OR TWO ON SUNDAY. PATCHY FROST IS ONCE             
AGAIN EXPECTED SUNDAY NIGHT WITH READINGS IN THE MID 30S TO AROUND              
40. SOME CONCERN FOR A MORE WIDESPREAD FROST AS WINDS MAY DECOUPLE              
AND GO CALM AND LESS LAKE CLOUDS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

NEARSHORE WATERS OF LAKE MICHIGAN AND HURON THROUGH 22Z. IMPRESSIVE             
OVER WATER INSTABILITY ALONG WITH A DECENT PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD             
CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME HIGHER WIND GUST AND WAVE GENERATION.

.UPDATE...FOR CLOUD COVER AND TEMPERATURES                                      
WE MODIFIED OUR GRIDS THROUGH TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR LOWER                      
TEMPERATURES AND MORE CLOUD COVER FOR SOME OF OUR CENTRAL AND

REGION OF STRATUS CONTINUING TO SLOWLY ERODE ON ITS NORTHERN                    
EDGE...HAVING CLEARED APPROXIMATELY THE NORTHERN QUARTER TO THIRD               
OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE CONTINUED PROGRESSION OF THIS CLEARING                
LINE WILL BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE NEAR TERM. AT THIS TIME...EXPECT               
THAT THE WESTERN EDGE WILL BE QUICKER TO GIVE WAY THAN THE EASTERN              
EDGE /PER THE RUC 925 MB RH ANALYSES AND CURRENT SPLIT CHANNEL                  
SATELLITE TRENDS/...SO HAVE KEPT SKY COVER FAIRLY HIGH TO THE                   
SOUTHEAST OF A LINE FROM EAU CLAIRE TO FAIRMONT THRU THE                        
AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION AND 850 MB TEMPS IN SINGLE                  
DIGITS SHOULD ALSO KEEP TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL...WITH                   
HIGHS HOVERING NEAR 60 FROM LADYSMITH TO LONG PRAIRIE.                          
NEXT ISSUE IS POSSIBILITY OF SOME PATCHY FROST TONIGHT ACROSS THE               
FAR NORTHERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. LOW TEMPS LOOK TO DIP                
INTO THE UPPER 30S TO THE NORTH OF A LINE FROM LITTLE FALLS...TO                
CAMBRIDGE...AND LADYSMITH...SO HAVE MENTIONED SOME PATCHY FROST                 
TONIGHT IN THESE AREAS.                                                         
SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL PLAINS                 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW MORNING...AND THE 00Z NAM AND GFS ARE HAVING               
THEIR DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED                
SURFACE SYSTEM...WHICH WILL HAVE A FAIRLY SIZEABLE IMPACT ON                    
PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR SUNDAY THRU MONDAY MORNING. THE GFS                   
DEVELOPS A CLOSED SURFACE LOW CENTERED NEAR KANSAS CITY BY 12Z                  
SUNDAY...WHEREAS THE NAM ANALYZES A RATHER UNIMPRESSIVE SOUTHWEST               
TO NORTHEAST ORIENTED SURFACE TROUGH IN THE SAME LOCATION.                      
PREVIOUS RUNS OF THE NAM HAVE FAVORED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE                    
CLOSED SURFACE LOW...AND THE LAST 3 RUNS OF THE GFS HAVE DEPICTED               
THE SAME...SO WILL FAVOR THIS SCENARIO.                                         
WITH THE MORE DEVELOPED SURFACE SYSTEM...AND DEEP HIGH PRESSURE                 
REMAINING OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA AND NORTHERN WISCONSIN AT THIS                
SAME TIME...AN AREA OF LOW AND MID LEVEL FRONTOGENESIS ORIENTS                  
ITSELF ALONG THE MINNESOTA AND IOWA BORDER ON SUNDAY...AND ROTATES              
TO THE NORTHEAST INTO WESTERN WISCONSIN BY MONDAY MORNING AS                    
CLOSED 700 MB LOW CENTER DOES LIKEWISE. THIS WILL BRING A CHANCE                
OF SHOWERS TO SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST                
AREA...ALTHOUGH ADMITTEDLY...THE BEST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION                   
SHOULD REMAIN TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THIS                    
PERIOD.                                                                         
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT WITH                 
COLD AIR CONTINUING TO FILTER INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON THE NORTH               
AND NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE CLOSED 700 MB LOW THAT WILL BE CENTERED               
NEAR THE SOUTHERN END OF LAKE MICHIGAN BY 12Z TUESDAY.                          
LONGER TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT                                      
THERE STILL REMAINS ALOT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE VARIOUS LONG TERM              
MODELS. PREFER THE LATEST ECMWF MODEL. THE GFS MODEL CONTINUES TO               
LACK RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY. LONGWAVE UPPER RIDGE INITIALLY IN PLACE            
OVER THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CONUS WILL SLOWLY PROGRESS                   
EASTWARD OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURG THE PERIOD.  UPPER AIRFLOW                  
BECOMES MORE ZONAL OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST AS UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES            
FROM THE WEST LATE IN THE PERIOD. DRY PERIOD AT THE ONSET FOLLOWED              
BY A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.  TEMPS                  
MAINLY NEAR OUR SEASONAL AVERAGE FOR THE PERIOD.

.SYNOPSIS...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS NORTHWEST            
ARIZONA THROUGH MONDAY AS MONSOON MOISTURE LINGERS ACROSS THE AREA.             
THE REMAINDER OF THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN WILL BE DRY WITH                      
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL.

.UPDATE...SHOWERS CURRENTLY HEADING OUT OF LINCOLN AND MOHAVE                   
COUNTIES. ISSUED A NOW FOR LINCOLN TO HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL FOR               
HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS. REST OF CWA CURRENTLY LOOKING CLEAR.                
BASED ON RUC ANALYSIS FEEL THAT ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE               
CONFINED TO MOHAVE AND LINCOLN COUNTIES WITH ONLY VERY OUTSIDE                  
CHANCES OVER HIGHER TERRAIN IN CLARK AND NYE. PW VALUES BEGIN A                 
RAPID FALL BY THIS EVENING SIGNALING CALM AND DRIER CONDITIONS FOR              
SUNDAY ALTHOUGH ENOUGH MOISTURE MAY HANG INTO MOHAVE TO POP OFF A               
FEW STORMS. CURRENTLY AM NOT PLANNING ANY UPDATES TO THE PACKAGE.               
&&                                                                              
.SHORT TERM...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS STILL GOING ACROSS MOHAVE                  
COUNTY EARLY THIS MORNING. STORMS BEING DRIVEN BY SHORTWAVE CROSSING            
SOUTHERN NEVADA AND UPPER DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH JET EARLY THIS             
MORNING. LOOK FOR STORMS TO CONTINUE INTO THE MORNING HOURS ACROSS              
MOHAVE COUNTY AS SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST. SHORTWAVE NOT                
STRONG ENOUGH TO SCOUR MOISTURE OUT OF MOHAVE COUNTY AND BELIEVE                
STORMS WILL RE-FIRE THIS AFTERNOON OVER NORTHWEST ARIZONA AND                   
NORTHEAST LINCOLN COUNTY. WE HAVE SEEN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DRAWN                 
NORTHWARD LAST EVENING INTO SOUTHERN NEVADA WHERE SURFACE DEWPOINTS             
HAVE CLIMBED BACK INTO THE UPPER 50S AROUND THE LAS VEGAS VALLEY.               
DON'T BELIEVE MOISTURE IS THAT DEEP AND WE SHOULD MIX OUT THIS                  
AFTERNOON WITH DEWPOINTS FALLING INTO THE 40S SIMILAR TO CURRENT                
READING JUST UP THE ROAD AT INDIAN SPRINGS. FOR SUNDAY AND                      
MONDAY...MOISTURE NEVER GETS SCOURED OUT OF SOUTHEAST THIRD OF                  
FORECAST AREA AS GFS DEVELOPS REX BLOCK OVER THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST             
MONDAY WITH HIGH CENTER OVER EASTERN IDAHO AND LOW CENTER OVER                  
ARIZONA. LOW LEVEL EASTERLY AROUND ARIZONA LOW WILL KEEP PW VALUES              
ABOVE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH OVER THE SOUTHEAST THIRD OF THE                 
AREA. NO SIGNIFICANT WINDS EXPECTED NEXT THREE DAY WHILE                        
TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO NORMAL.                                           
.LONG TERM...LITTLE CHANGE TO FORECAST AS MODELS ARE HAVING A TOUGH             
TIME DEPICTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOSED UPPER LOW DEVELOPING OVER            
THE PAC NW LATE NEXT WEEK. GFS SEEMS TO BE THE FASTEST AND DEEPEST              
WITH THE SYSTEM...WITH OTHER MODELS LAGGING BEHIND CONSIDERABLY. FOR            
NOW...THE NCEP MEAN ARGUES FOR A SLOWER AND SHALLOWER SYSTEM OVER               
NEXT WEEKEND. REGARDLESS OF THE MODEL...THE APPROACHING SYSTEM WILL             
TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN                    
INCREASE IN SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS FROM THURSDAY ONWARDS. TEMPERATURES             
WILL WARM TO A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL EARLY IN THE EXTENDED...WITH            
RISING HEIGHTS AND DRIER CONDITIONS BENEATH THE RIDGE. EXPECT TO SEE            
SOME DEGREE OF COOLING TOWARDS THE END OF THE EXTENDED AS HEIGHTS               
FALL DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND LOCATION OF THE UPPER LOW.

.AVIATION...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR IN THE PEACH SPRINGS              
CORRIDOR TODAY. THE REMAINDER OF THE APPROACH/DEPARTURE CORRIDORS               
WILL BE CLEAR OF THUNDERSTORMS. TAFS AND TWEBS ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE              
EXPECTED WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR AREA TERMINALS. SEE TAFS FOR

.NEAR TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...CURRENTLY WATCHING A LINE OF SHOWERS              
AND TSTMS MOVING EAST ACROSS NORTHEAST PA AT AROUND 15 KT. AT THIS              
CURRENT MOTION...THE STORMS COULD AFFECT ORANGE COUNTY AS EARLY AS              
22Z...AND REACH PUTNAM AND WESTERN PASSAIC BY 00Z. SPC 19Z                      
MESOANALYSIS SHOWED STORMS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK THETA-E RIDGE              
AHEAD OF APPROACHING SURFACE COLD FRONT...WITH MLCAPE OF 500-1000               
J/KG WITH AROUND 25 KT OF WIND AT H5...SO A STORM OR TWO COULD                  
MANAGE TO PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS AND SOME HAIL. AREAS FARTHER                      
SOUTH/EAST ARE RATHER DRY AT H8 AND RUC SOUNDINGS LOOK CAPPED...SO              
WOULD ONLY EXPECT A SHOWER OR TWO...POSSIBLY A TSTM...ELSEWHERE                 
NORTH AND WEST OF NYC.                                                          
COLD FRONT DROPS THROUGH THE AREA LATER TONIGHT...AND WE PREFER                 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER NAM TIMING. CLOUDS LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT SO WILL              
CALL IT PARTLY CLOUDY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED BY A MOSTLY             
SUNNY AFTERNOON. MAX TEMPS WILL BE ABOUT 5-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN               
THOSE OF TODAY...LOWER AND MID 70S AS OPPOSED TO THE MID 70S TO MID             
80S OF TODAY.

.SHORT TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...DRY WX WILL CONTINUE AS            
A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS OUT OF CANADA. MAIN CONCERNS                
WILL BE HOW COOL DO NIGHTTIME TEMPS GET INLAND...AND HOW MUCH WIND              
WILL THERE BE ESPECIALLY IN COASTAL SECTIONS FROM INTERACTION                   
BETWEEN THE HIGH AND FLORENCE...WHICH IS FORECAST TO PASS VERY NEAR             
BERMUDA AND THEN RECURVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. FOR TEMPS HAVE STAYED            
CLOSE TO MAV NUMBERS FOR MINS WHICH ARE MAINLY IN THE 40S INLAND AND            
50S AT THE COAST...WITH SOME UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS MON NIGHT IN COASTAL            
SECTIONS WHERE NE FLOW SHOULD PREVENT DECOUPLING. MAY HAVE TO                   
REVISIT MIN TEMPS FOR SHELTERED INLAND AREAS WHICH COULD DROP CLOSE             
TO 40 MON NIGHT...IN ANY CASE THEY SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE FROST                    
ADVISORY CRITERIA.                                                              
WINDS WILL TURN NE ON MON AS A PORTION OF THE HIGH NOSES DOWN THE               
MID ATLANTIC COAST...AND AS FLORENCE PASSES OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST.               
MAIN IMPACT FROM WINDS WILL BE FELT OVER LONG ISLAND AND COASTAL                
CT...WHERE THEY COULD PICK UP TO 10-20 MPH SUSTAINED WITH GUSTS UP              
TO 30 MPH. THESE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE ON TUE AS FLORENCE               
HEAD NE OUT INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC AND PULLS FARTHER AWAY FROM THE              
AREA. SEE THE MARINE SECTION BELOW FOR POTENTIAL SURF AND COASTAL               
FLOODING IMPACTS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE            
AREA TUE NIGHT AND WED WILL SHIFT E OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST WED               
NIGHT...WITH AN E-NE FLOW GRADUALLY TURNING SE BETWEEN THE HIGH AND             
WEAK LOW PRESSURE APPROACHING FROM THE OH VALLEY. INTRODUCED A                  
CHANCE OF SHOWERS WED NIGHT INTO THU NIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF THE             
LOW...ALSO SOME PATCHY FOG THU NIGHT IN SECOND NIGHT OF SE FLOW OF              
MARITIME AIR...AND INTO EARLY FRI MORNING WITH ONLY LIGHT N-NW FLOW             
BEHIND DEPARTING LOW. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FOR FRI AND SAT WITH                
WARMING TEMPS. A WARMUP TO MORE SUMMERLIKE TEMPS COULD BE IN STORE              
FOR NEXT WEEKEND...POSSIBLE FLY IN THE OINTMENT VERY LATE IN THE                
PERIOD OR JUST BEYOND INTO SUN-MON COULD BE BACK DOOR COLD                      
FROPA...DEPENDING UPON STRENGTH OF DEEP CLOSED LOW PROGGED TO BE IN             
PLACE NEAR THE DAVIS STRAIT AND GREENLAND AT THAT TIME. MY BET IS               
THE NW FLOW OVER EASTERN CANADA AS DEPICTED BY THE GFS IS PROGGED TO            
BE TOO STRONG AND THAT WE WILL STAY WARM.

IT...LARGELY VFR CONDITIONS WERE BEING OBSERVED WITH A FEW TERMINALS            
REPORTING MVFR HAZE AND SCT CU. THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH            
THE TERMINALS THIS EVENING...AROUND 00Z SWF...02Z NYC METRO...AND               
03Z TO 04Z FOR THE EASTERN TERMINALS. CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR                     
CONVECTION AT ANY ONE TERMINAL...BUT WILL CARRY A CB GROUP AT KSWF              
AS THIS TERMINAL LIES IN AN AREA OF GREATER INSTABILITY. WINDS WILL             
VEER AROUND TO THE NW AND EVENTUALLY N BY DAYBREAK. ON SUN...WINDS              
WILL CONTINUE TO VEER AROUND TO NE AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS SOUTHEAST            
ACROSS EASTERN CANADA...WHILE T.S. FLORENCE TRACKING TO THE NW PICKS            
UP FORWARD SPEED OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.

.MARINE...NO FLAGS EXPECTED ON THE WATERS THROUGH MIDDAY SUN...BUT              
CONDITIONS WILL GO DOWNHILL THEREAFTER. IN THE NEAR TERM...A COLD               
FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST THIS EVENING AND CROSS THE               
WATERS OVERNIGHT...WITH WINDS VEERING FROM SW TO N AFTER MIDNIGHT.              
WIND SPEEDS SHOULD REMAIN LESS THAN 15 KT THROUGH THE FROPA. NOT                
EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT TSTM ACTIVITY OVER THE WATERS WITH                    
THE FRONT.                                                                      
FOCUS THEN TURNS TO MARINE EFFECTS FROM TROPICAL STORM FLORENCE. THE            
WNA AND NAH GUIDANCE ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT LONG PERIOD SE SWELL            
FROM FLORENCE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE COASTAL WATERS TONIGHT...             
BUT SEAS WILL REMAIN BELOW SCA LEVELS UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SEAS              
WILL BECOME RATHER ROUGH DURING THE DAY WITH NORTH WINDS OF 10-15 KT            
PRODUCING WIND WAVES WHICH WILL BE CLASHING WITH THE INCREASING SE              
SWELL. EXPECT ROUGH CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP AT INLETS AS WELL DUE TO              
THE LONG PERIOD SWELL. WINDS AND SEAS WILL INCREASE FURTHER SUN                 
NIGHT AS SWELLS FROM FLORENCE CONTINUE AND THE PRESSURE GRADIENT                
TIGHTENS BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE OVER SE CANADA AND THE LARGE                     
CIRCULATION OF FLORENCE WELL OFFSHORE. NE WINDS OF 15-25 KT WILL BE             
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE EASTERN OCEAN ZONES DURING THIS TIME...ALONG                
WITH SEAS BUILDING TO 6-7 FT.                                                   
PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT MON AND MON NIGHT WITH BRISK NE FLOW            
CONTINUING. GRADIENT THEN RELAXES TUE AND BEYOND AS THE HIGH BUILDS             
INTO NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND FLORENCE MOVES NORTH OF BERMUDA.                  
SWELLS WILL REMAIN A PROBLEM HOWEVER...WITH THE HIGHEST SEAS                    
EXPECTED MON AFTERNOON THROUGH TUE MORNING WHEN SIG WAVE HGTS OF                
7-10 FT WILL BE LIKELY ACROSS THE OCEAN ZONES.                                  
HAVE GONE AHEAD AND POSTED SCA FOR THE OCEAN ZONES...BEGINNING SUN              
AFTERNOON. THIS WILL LIKELY BE A LONG DURATION SCA AS SEAS WILL                 
REMAIN HIGH FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AFTER SUN MORNING...THU WILL PROBABLY             
BE THE NEXT DAY WHEN SEAS ARE BELOW 5 FT ON THE OCEAN.                          
WITH HIGH SEAS AND A LONG DURATION NE FETCH EXPECTED FROM SUN EVENING           
THROUGH TUE...WOULD EXPECT A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS TO DEVELOP ALONG               
THE COAST INCLUDING HIGH SURF...DANGEROUS RIP CURRENTS...AND SOME               
MINOR COASTAL OVERWASH AND FLOODING. COASTAL FLOODING WILL BE MOST              
LIKELY ACROSS THE BACK BAYS OF THE LONG ISLAND SOUTH SHORE BEGINNING            
SUN NIGHT. LOCALLY MODERATE COASTAL FLOODING WOULD NOT BE OUT OF THE            
QUESTION...ESPECIALLY DURING THE HIGH TIDE CYCLES MON THROUGH TUE.

MORNING/AFTERNOON.  SURFACE FRONT CURRENTLY JUST NORTH OF LAKE                  
ERIE...HOWEVER MAJORITY OF PRECIP STILL BEHIND THE FRONT OVER

THE LAKE SINCE 4AM...RUC SHOWING A WEAK THETA-E RIDGE JUST AHEAD OF             
THE FRONT...THIS COMBINED WITH RELATIVELY UNSTABLE AIR OVER THE LAKE            
THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THESE SHOWERS. CLE/DTX RADAR CURRENTLY SHOWING A            
WEAK BOUNDARY OVER THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF THE LAKE...PUSHING INLAND              
AND SPAWNING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

BETWEEN MOS GUIDANCE AND RAW MODEL OUTPUT IN TERMS OF CEILINGS...MOS            
KEEPS CIGS VFR...RAW MODEL OUTPUT BRINGS IN LOW CIGS UNDER 1000FT.              
SINCE CIGS ARE ALREADY WELL BELOW 1000FT BEHIND THE FRONT AT THE                
MOMENT...AM INCLINED TO BRING THESE LOW CEILINGS INTO OUR TERMINALS

FORECAST CHALLENGE CONTINUES TO BE CLOUDS AND TEMPS.                            
PRESENTLY HAVE COOL CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER                        
ONTARIO...WITH STRATUS CLOUDS DISSIPATING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA              
EXCEPT OVER THE BUFFALO RIDGE.                                                  
THE 12Z GFS/NAM-WRF SOLUTIONS WERE...AGAIN...SIMILAR TODAY WITH                 
UPPER FLOW AND HANDLING OF S/WS OVER THE REGION...LEAVING THIS                  
FORECAST AREA DRY. WEAK BAROCLINIC ZONE SETTING UP IN WEAK WAA                  
ALOFT OVER EASTERN MONTANA AND WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA IS GENERATING               
SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THIS BAROCLINIC ZONE MAY EVENTUALLY                
MAKE IT DOWN HERE BY MONDAY...BUT LEAVING THE FORECAST DRY FOR                  
NOW. NEXT...ATTENTION TURNS TO THIS PERSISTENT LOW LEVEL THERMAL                
INVERSION AND SHALLOW COOL AIR INTRUSION THAT HAS SET UP ACROSS                 
THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT THAT PASSED                      
SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION BACK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND NOW SITS               
STATIONARY ACROSS NEBRASKA AND IOWA. WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT LOW                
LEVEL DRY AIR INTRUSIONS TO SCOUR OUT THE MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER                
THE INVERSION...SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A THIRD DAY OF STRATUS FUN ON              
SUNDAY...BURNING OFF BY AFTERNOON...AND THEN REDEVELOPING AGAIN                 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. THIS THEME MAY EVEN NEED TO BE                
REPEATED INTO TUESDAY. FOR NOW...THOUGH...DETERMINED TO CLEAR                   
THINGS OUT ON TUESDAY AS RETURN FLOW SETS UP IN RESPONSE TO                     
APPROACHING S/W ENERGY OVER THE ROCKIES ON DAY 3. TEMPERATURES                  
WHERE THE MOST DIRECT INSOLATION OCCURS COULD SEE 70S...BUT AREAS               
THAT REMAIN SOCKED IN UNDER LOW STRATUS CLOUDS WILL LIKELY NOT SEE              
TEMPERATURES REBOUND MUCH PAST MID 60S.                                         
.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY                                         
GOOD AGREEMENT AMONGST THE MODELS WITH THE LONG WAVE FLOW PATTERN               
FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE PERIOD BEGINS WITH WEST TO WEST             
NORTHWEST FLOW AT 50H OFF THE PACIFIC ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST WITH             
LARGE TROUGHING IN WESTERN CANADA AND OFF THE COAST. THROUGH THE                
FORECAST PERIOD...THE TROUGHING DROPS INTO THE WESTERN US AND                   
WESTERN CANADA...CLOSES OFF AND INTENSIFIES AS UPPER RIDGING                    
DEVELOPS TO THE EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PART OF THE US. WITH THIS               
OCCURRING...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL DEEPEN OFF TO THE NORTHWEST OF            
OUR CWA WITH WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR BEING DRAWN INTO THE REGION.             
ALSO...COULD SEE SOME WINDY CONDITIONS AS SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT             
WILL TIGHTEN UP ALONG WITH LLJ INCREASING. HAVE UPPED TEMPERATURES              
THROUGH THE ENTIRE PERIOD. WOULD NOT DOUBT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE                 
INCREASED MORE AS WARM THICKNESSES BUILD IN. ALSO...HAVE SOME 20                
POPS IN THROUGH MUCH OF THE FORECAST AS SHORT WAVES ROLL IN OFF THE

SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT                                         
CHALLENGES IN THE SHORT TERM CONTINUE TO BE CLOUD COVER AND                     
RESULTANT TEMPERATURES. STRATUS LAYER CONTINUES TO EDGE WESTWARD                
INTO EASTERN SD EARLY THIS MORNING WITH THE DECK STRETCHING EAST                
INTO WISCONSIN. ABR WAS DOWN TO BKN008 DURING THE PAST 30 MINUTES               
WITH CEILINGS AROUND 1000 FT FARTHER EAST TOWARDS THE SD/MN BORDER.             
RUC/NAM/GFS ALL SHOWING HIGH RH AT 925 MB PUSHING INTO THE AREA                 
THROUGH SUNRISE...BUT DRIES THINGS OUT THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.                  
MODELS HAVE BEEN IFFY AT HANDLING CLOUD COVER THE PAST FEW DAYS BUT             
SEEM TO BE DOING OK THIS MORNING. QUESTIONS FOR THE DAY WILL BE JUST            
HOW MUCH CLOUD COVER MAKES IT INTO THE ABR CWA AND HOW LONG WILL IT             
LAST. MODELS WOULD SUGGEST STRATUS BREAKING UP DURING THE                       
MORNING...WITH THE MORE MOIST AIR AT 925/850 MB ACROSS SOUTHERN SD.             
HAVE THEREFORE CONSTRUCTED SKY COVER GRIDS TO REFLECT MORE CLOUDS               
FURTHER SOUTH IN THE CWA. UPPER WAVE OVER CO/WY THIS MORNING WILL               
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE EAST INTO THE PLAINS THROUGH TONIGHT...AND STILL            
APPEARS TO STAY SOUTH OF OUR AREA. ALTHOUGH...THE SOUTHERN PORTION              
OF THE CWA WILL MORE THAN LIKELY SEE CLOUD COVER IN ASSOCIATION WITH            
THIS SYSTEM. MODELS TRYING TO SUGGEST SOME STRATUS CLOUD COVER EACH             
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING BUT WITH THE RECENT STRUGGLES THE                  
MODELS HAVE HAD WITH CLOUDS...HAVE OPTED TO PLAY IN CONSERVATIVE FOR            
NOW UNTIL FUTURE SHIFTS CAN TRY TO NAIL IT DOWN BETTER. AS FOR                  
TEMPERATURES...BUMPED UP HIGHS A FEW DEGREES ACROSS THE EAST TODAY              
AND SUNDAY. SHORT TERM STAYS DRY AS THE WAVE PULLING OUT INTO THE               
CENTRAL PLAINS REMAINS TO THE SOUTH.                                            
LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY                                            
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE CHANGING AGAIN SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW.  THE               
PERIOD OPENS WITH A RETREATING UPPER LOW MOVING THROUGH ILLINOIS                
WHILE AN UPPER RIDGE TILTS ACROSS THIS AREA.  RIDGE QUICKLY GETS                
FLATTENED INTO FAST WESTERLY FLOW WITH OLD BAROCLINIC ZONE IN                   
SOUTHERN CANADA.  AS THE NEXT PACIFIC LOW PUSHES ONSHORE THE PACIFIC            
COAST THURSDAY THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY SINKS SOUTH AND IS OVER THE             
AREA BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY POP OVER             
MUCH OF THE AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS THIS FRONT WILL DRAPE ACROSS            
CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER IT.  THERE IS A             
GOOD MOISTURE FETCH FROM THE SOUTH AT THE LOW LEVELS.  DO NOT THINK             
THIS WILL MAKE THIS A BIG EVENT BUT MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO              
EVEN GET A THUNDERSTORM GOING.  DID NOT WORD FOR THUNDERSTORM IN THE            
GOING GRIDS.  WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

.DISCUSSION...JUST LIKE LAST NIGHT, LATE DAY PRECIPITATION WAS VERY             
SLOW TO DIMINISH AND LASTED UP UNTIL CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT. HOWEVER,                
BELIEVE WE ARE NOW PROBABLY SAFE TO UPDATE AND REMOVE MENTION OF                
OVERNIGHT PRECIPITATION (ESPECIALLY SINCE RUC ALSO INDICATES A DRY              
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT). CAN'T RULE OUT A ROGUE SHOWER SOMEWHERE LATER          
TONIGHT, BUT COVERAGE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE INSIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO               
LEAVE OUT OF THE FORECAST.

NOT HIGH WITH THIS UPCOMING FORECAST PACKAGE. NAM DID NOT                       
INITIALIZE WELL AND GFS HAS CHANGED THE SCENARIO FOR THE NEXT                   
SEVERAL DAYS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RUN. LATEST GFS RUN HAS                       
BACKTRACKED ON MOISTURE/POPS NEXT SEVERAL DAYS LOWERING PWATS                   
LATER THIS WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT WEEK DUE TO DRYING AT MID/UPPER                
LEVELS. NAM IS LESS AGGRESSIVE. GFS NOW BRINGING DRIER LOW LEVEL                
AIR 24 HOURS EARLIER WHICH WILL BE TUESDAY PUSHING WEAK FRONT TO

THE REMAINS OF A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A                    
CONFLUENT ZONE OVER THE COASTAL WATERS AND ARE PROVIDING A REGION OF            
OVERRUNNING WITH LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER 4KFT OR SO WITH               
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW AT HIGHER LEVELS.  THIS IS SETTING THE STAGE            
FOR PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A SHORT WAVE            
MOVES THROUGH THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT... AND IS PRODUCING                  
BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR AND IFR CONDITIONS MAINLY SOUTH OF A LINE FROM            
VCT TO IAH.  OVER THE GULF... THUNDERSTORMS ARE MORE PREVALENT AND              
AIRCRAFT MAY NEED TO BE REROUTED TO AVOID SOME CLUSTERS OF                      
THUNDERSTORMS OVER COASTAL WATERS FROM PORT LAVACA TO TALLAHASSEE.              
CONDITIONS OVER THE HOUSTON FORECAST ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE                    
SLIGHTLY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WITH DIMINISHING PRECIPITATION              
AND CEILINGS LIFTING AS THE FIRST SHORT WAVE IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY

SECOND LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE WHICH WAS IN THE HE BIG BEND REGION             
THIS MORNING.  ADDITIONALLY... MOST MODELS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP            
A MORE DISTINCT TROUGH OR COASTAL LOW ON THE REMNANT BOUNDARY WHICH             
WILL BRING ANOTHER BOUT OF PRECIPITATION SUNDAY... MOST LIKELY WITH             
MORE WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE.  CONSEQUENTLY... WILL HAVE ON            
AND OFF MVFR AND IFR CONDITIONS AGAIN AFTER 09Z SUNDAY AND WILL HAVE            
THE POTENTIAL FOR AIRFIELDS THROUGHOUT THE REGION TO BE IMPACTED BY             
PERIODS OF IFR CONDITIONS IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT

THE BOUNDARY ALONG THE COAST MENTIONED IN THE AVIATION SECTION ABOVE            
HAS PROVIDED A FOCUS FOR THE GENERATION OF NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND                 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE COASTAL WATERS. THE DISTURBED WEATHER WILL               
DIMINISH TONIGHT BUT IS EXPECTED TO REDEVELOP SUNDAY MORNING AS A               
COASTAL TROUGH BECOMES BETTER DEFINED AND ANOTHER SHORT WAVE MOVES              
INTO SOUTHEAST TEXAS AND THE ADJACENT COASTAL WATERS. WINDS WILL                
CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY VARIABLE REST OF TODAY... MAINLY EAST NORTH               
OF THE BOUNDARY AND SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH ON THE SOUTH SIDE...                     
FURTHER COMPLICATED BY DOWNDRAFTS FROM THUNDERSTORMS. THE LIGHT                 
SURFACE FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE VARIABLE ON MONDAY WITH WINDS                  
BECOMING NORTHEAST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE                
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND VERY WEAK GRADIENTS OVER THE GULF. A WEAK                 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION TUESDAY REINFORCING THE NORTHEAST               
FLOW... FOLLOWED BY DRIER AIR AND WINDS VEERING TO EAST ON                      
WEDNESDAY AND RETURNING TO A LIGHT ONSHORE FLOW LATE IN THE WEEK.

SHRA/TSRA CLUSTER ASSOCIATED WITH MCV MOVING ENE ACROSS UPPER TEXAS             
COAST AND COASTAL ZONES. SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER FAR               
SOUTH TEXAS PICKED UP BY 18Z RUC AND WEAKEN THIS ACTIVITY BY EVENING.           
BELIEVE THIS MAY STILL STILL AFFECT COASTAL WATERS AND TO A LESSER              
EXTENT COASTAL ZONES. UPPER LEVEL FLOW NEARLY ZONAL ACROSS                      
BOTH GFS AND NAM INDICATE COASTAL REGION WILL HAVE WEAK CONFLUENT               
LOW LEVEL FLOW THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH WITH             
THIS UPCOMING FORECAST PACKAGE. NAM DID NOT INITIALIZE WELL AND                 
GFS HAS CHANGED THE SCENARIO FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS COMPARED TO              
PREVIOUS RUN. LATEST GFS RUN HAS BACKTRACKED ON MOISTURE/POPS NEXT              
SEVERAL DAYS LOWERING PWATS LATER THIS WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT WEEK               
DUE TO DRYING AT MID/UPPER LEVELS. NAM IS LESS AGGRESSIVE.                      
GFS NOW BRINGING DRIER LOW LEVEL AIR 24 HOURS EARLIER WHICH WILL                
BE TUESDAY PUSHING WEAK FRONT TO THE NW GULF. MOISTURE INCREASE                 
NOTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT OVER SW SECTIONS AND RETURN FLOW EVIDENT                  
AREAWIDE THURSDAY. THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AGAIN WILL HAVE HIGH               
MOISTURE LEVELS WITH PASSING IMPULSES IN THE UPPER LEVEL WSW FLOW.              
NOTE THAT WE WILL WAIT FOR MORE CONSISTENCY WITH LATER MODEL RUNS               
BEFORE WE LOWER OR TAKE OFF POPS FOR TUESDAY (AS WHAT GFS IS NOW                
INDICATING).

THE REMAINS OF A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A                    
CONFLUENT ZONE OVER THE COASTAL WATERS AND ARE PROVIDING A REGION OF            
OVERRUNNING WITH LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER 4KFT OR SO WITH               
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW AT HIGHER LEVELS.  THIS IS SETTING THE STAGE            
FOR PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A SHORT WAVE            
MOVES THROUGH THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT... AND IS PRODUCING                  
BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR AND IFR CONDITIONS MAINLY SOUTH OF A LINE FROM            
VCT TO IAH.  OVER THE GULF... THUNDERSTORMS ARE MORE PREVALENT AND              
AIRCRAFT MAY NEED TO BE REROUTED TO AVOID SOME CLUSTERS OF                      
THUNDERSTORMS OVER COASTAL WATERS FROM PORT LAVACA TO TALLAHASSEE.              
CONDITIONS OVER THE HOUSTON FORECAST ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE                    
SLIGHTLY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WITH DIMINISHING PRECIPITATION              
AND CEILINGS LIFTING AS THE FIRST SHORT WAVE IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY               
FLOW ALOFT LIFTS OUT...BUT THIS WAVE WILL BE FOLLOWED TOMORROW BY A             
SECOND LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE WHICH WAS IN THE HE BIG BEND REGION             
THIS MORNING.  ADDITIONALLY... MOST MODELS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP            
A MORE DISTINCT TROUGH OR COASTAL LOW ON THE REMNANT BOUNDARY WHICH             
WILL BRING ANOTHER BOUT OF PRECIPITATION SUNDAY... MOST LIKELY WITH             
MORE WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE.  CONSEQUENTLY... WILL HAVE ON            
AND OFF MVFR AND IFR CONDITIONS AGAIN AFTER 09Z SUNDAY AND WILL HAVE

INSTABILITY FROM GROWING TOO FORMIDABLE AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT

POP GETS EATEN UP BY THE DRY AIR SOON AFTER EACH ATTEMPTED CELL                 
FORMS. OTHER CONVECTION IS SUCCESSFULLY FORMING IN CENTRAL KY WITH              
A SLOW DRIFT TO THE EAST...SO THIS WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED. BUT I

WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS SOME MID LEVEL MOISTURE EDGING INTO THE                  
CWA. THIS...ALONG WITH INTERMITTENT HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT...WILL                  
MAKE FOG CONDITIONS NOT AS IDEAL AS RECENT NIGHT. I STILL DO                    
EXPECT FOG...BUT IT WILL LIKELY BE MORE PATCHY AND LESS DENSE                   
COMPARED TO THIS MORNING. AS FOR TEMPS...I MAINLY USED MET

THE GOING FORECAST HAD SLIGHT TO CHANCE POPS SPREADING INTO THE                 
HIGHER TERRAIN SUNDAY NIGHT...DUE TO THE FORMATION OF AN INVERTED               
TROUGH WITH SOUTHEAST FLOW. LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE BRINGING THIS IN              
A BIT EARLIER...AND WITH SLIGHTLY MORE MOISTURE AND

NOT BE AS IDEAL AS RECENT NIGHTS. I STILL SEE MOST TAF SITES /ALL

.SHORT TERM...MSAS ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED            
OVER THE CAROLINAS WITH A TIGHTENING GRADIENT TO THE EAST OF THE                
HIGH FROM THE INTERACTION WITH DISTANT FLORENCE. THIS LEAVES OUR                
AREA IN A MUCH LIGHTER NORTHEAST FLOW REGIME. THERE ARE SOME                    
SHOWERS OVER THE COASTAL WATERS AT THIS HOUR...BUT THEY SEEM TO BE              
THE MORE TYPICAL NOCTURNAL TYPE AND NOT AS MUCH STREAMLINE                      
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE COAST HAS RESULTED IN LESS LAND BASED                     
CONVECTION COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT. TO THE WEST OF THE                           
AREA...SHOWERS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AIDED BY A DECENT ISENTROPIC                 
UPGLIDE PROFILE INDICATED BY THE RUC. THE RUC KEEPS THIS AREA TO                
THE WEST OF US THROUGH DAYBREAK...BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A           
FEW SPRINKLES EMANATING FROM THICKENING MID A HIGH LEVEL DECK.                  
FOR THE REMAINDER OF TODAY...WAS HOPING FOR BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT              
FOR THIS RUN BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. ALTHOUGH THE MODELS ARE                  
TRENDING TOWARD EACH OTHER...I AM STILL LEFT WITH A 30% POP                     
DISCREPANCY WITH THE GFS BEING THE WETTER SOLUTION. NOT A WHOLE                 
LOT TO HANG MY HAT ON WRT MODEL INITIALIZATION BUT HAVE NOTED A                 
BETTER REPRESENTATION OF FLORENCE BY THE NAM...BOTH IN SIZE AND                 
INTENSITY OF THE STORM. THIS WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE THAT INFLUX              
OF DRY AIR IN EASTERLY FLOW UP TO 5K FEET WOULD INFILTRATE THE                  
EASTERN SECTIONS A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT THE GFS INDICATES. PLAN                
FOR TODAY IS TO GO WITH HIGHEST POPS FOR THE WESTERN                            
ZONES...KEEPING LOW END LIKELY WHERE MODELS HAVE THE BEST                       
AGREEMENT AND THEN SHOW A SHARP GRADIENT TOWARD THE EAST WHERE                  
THE BEACHES WILL ONLY SEE LOW END SCATTERED RAIN CHANCES.                       
THERMODYNAMIC PROFILE IS VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...SO MAY SEE SOME            
STRONG STORMS WITH PROLIFIC LIGHTNING BUT THAT SHOULD BE THE                    
EXTENT OF IT.                                                                   
FOR MONDAY...MODELS ACTUALLY COME INTO A BIT BETTER AGREEMENT WITH              
THE STRENGTHENING OF MID ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE WITH SOME WEDGING               
INDICTED DOWN THE EAST COAST. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE MORE DRYING AND               
TEND TO SHUNT THE BULK OF THE PRECIP TO THE WEST. NAM A LITTLE                  
STRONGER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF GULF COAST LOW WHICH ACTS TO DRAW              
MOISTURE CLOSER TO IT. FEEL THIS MAY BE A BIT OVERDONE AND WILL                 
LEAN TOWARD THE MAV POPS WHICH ARE IN THE MID RANGE SCATTERED                   
CATEGORY. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SCENARIO IN STORE FOR TUE WITH                   
RIDGE TO THE NORTHEAST AND DEEP MOISTURE TO THE WEST CREATING                   
QUITE A POP GRADIENT ACROSS THE CWA. STILL FEEL THE BEST RAIN                   
CHANCES WILL BE WEST OF THE AREA AND WILL KEEP GRIDS IN THE                     
SCATTERED CATEGORY FOR NOW. WITH MORE STABLE SURFACE LAYER                      
BUILDING IN THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...MAY BE ABLE TO GET BY WITH                
JUST ISOLATED THUNDER. WILL KEEP SCT FOR NOW TO ACCOUNT FOR                     
ELEVATED CONVECTION POSSIBILITY AND LET LATER SHIFTS REFINE IF

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE WITH ONLY MINOR                    
ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED TO POPS. THE NAM/RUC CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CURRENT            
WX MODELED WELL AND THE GFS STILL APPEARS TO PUSH THE HEAVIER RAINS             
TOO FAR NORTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. NUMEROUS INGREDIENTS ARE IN PLACE              
FOR SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL OVER MOST OF THE CWA THROUGH                           
MONDAY...INCLUDING PWAT/S AOA 1.5 INCHES...STRONG PERSISTENT                    
ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE TRANSPORT. THIS ALSO HAS THE LOOK OF A             
STRONG WINTER SYSTEM COMPLETE WITH WELL DEFINED TROWAL AND                      
DEFORMATION AXIS. MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD RECEIVE AN                   
ADDITIONAL 2 TO 4 INCHES OF RAIN THROUGH MONDAY ESPECIALLY ALONG AND            
SOUTH OF HIGHWAY 20...WITH ISOLATED 4 TO 6 INCH TOTALS A GOOD BET.              
THE NAM IS NAILING SOUTHERN IOWA IN PARTICULAR TODAY AND TONIGHT                
WITH STRONG ADIABATIC ISENTROPIC OMEGA. RAINFALL RATES WILL BE SUCH             
THAT FLASH FLOODING SHOULD NOT BE MUCH OF A CONCERN. SOME MINOR                 
URBAN STREET FLOODING IS EXPECTED. THE MAIN CONCERN IS THE RESPONSE             
OF AREA RIVERS...AND IN PARTICULAR THE FASTER RESPONDING CREEKS AND             
RIVERS LATER TODAY THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEK. A FLOOD WATCH            
MAY BE IN THE OFFING LATER TODAY AND WILL HIT HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL              
HARD IN GRIDS/ZONES/HWO.                                                        
THE HEAVIER RAINS SHOULD SHIFT TO THE EAST BY DAYBREAK TUESDAY                  
FOLLOWED BY A NARROW SFC HI PRES RIDGE. THE WARMING TREND FOR LATER

400 AM EDT SUN SEP 10 2006

THE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE ARE THE OVERNIGHT LOWS             
TONIGHT AND CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT.                                     
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC SHOWING A NEAR ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE                
SOUTH HALF OF CONUS...A LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA...A                 
RIDGE OVER CENTRAL CANADA...AND ANOTHER LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER GULF OF            
ALASKA. A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRAPPED IN THE NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS NORTH             
AMERICA IS OVER SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA STRETCHING INTO NORTHERN                   
MINNESOTA. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IS OVER EASTERN ONTARIO WORKING ITS WAY            
THROUGH THE BASE OF THE EASTERN CANADIAN TROUGH. SURFACE ANALYSIS               
INSIST THAT A STATIONARY FRONT STRETCHES FROM KWDC THROUGH THE                  
SOUTHERN OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO A LOW OVER NORTH CENTRAL KANSAS. A                
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE BLANKETS ONTARIO...SOUTHERN QUEBEC AND              
THE GREAT LAKES REGION. A FRONTAL SYSTEM IS DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN            
CANADIAN PRAIRIE AND OVER THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS OF CONUS. A FEW              
THUNDERSTORMS AND SHOWERS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVERNIGHT IN                      
ASSOCIATION WITH THE LOW OVER KANSAS.                                           
THE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE VERY LITTLE TODAY AS WILL THE RIDGE               
OVER CENTRAL CANADA. THE SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL              
REMAIN DOMINATE OVER THE REGION. PRECIPITABLE WATER WILL BE AROUND              
.5 INCH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE             
A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION AROUND 850MB OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE             
925MB TEMPERATURES ARE PROGGED TO BE CLOSE TO THE SAME AS                       
YESTERDAY'S... EXCEPT A LITTLE WARMER OVER THE EASTERN U.P. EVEN THE            
TRAJECTORY PROGS INDICATE VERY LITTLE CHANCE IN AIR MASS.                       
HOWEVER...TODAY THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATING A LITTLE LESS LOW             
LEVEL CLOUDS. THUS MAY EXPECT A LITTLE WARMER TEMPERATURES DUE TO               
THE ADDITIONAL SUN. PLAN TO GO WITH JUST A LITTLE HIGHER TEMPERAURES            
THAN YESTERDAYS WHICH IS WHAT GUIDANCE SUGGEST ALSO.                            
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL SLIDE INTO WESTERN ONTARIO TONIGHT WHILE               
THE SURFACE RIDGE PUSHES INTO SOUTHWEST QUEBEC. A SHORTWAVE WILL RUN            
INTO THE RIDGE AND START TO BREAK IT DOWN. THE SURFACE LOW OVER                 
KANSAS WILL TRAVEL INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI...PULLING A PORTION OF THE            
FRONTAL SYSTEM NORTHERN INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS AND CENTRAL INDIANA.              
THE ACCOMPANYING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER RUNNING THE FRONT WILL                 
SHIFT INTO SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND INTO LOWER MICHIGAN...STILL KEEP              
THE FORECAST AREA DRY. A 70 KNOT UPPER LEVEL JET MAX WILL SLIDE                 
ACROSS NORTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN TONIGHT. KEEPING THE FORECAST AREA               
UNDER THE LEFT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET MAX. THUS WITH THE DRY AIR            
ENTRENCHED OVER THE FORECAST AREA PLAN TO KEEP THE FORECAST AREA                
DRY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SHOW A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE                
FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT EXCEPT ALONG THE LAKE MICHIGAN SHORELINE.             
GFS SOUNDING DRAWING CLOUDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 500MB AND             
ABOVE. THIS MAY REDUCE RADIATIONAL COOLING. WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF SUN            
FOR TODAY AND AN INCREASE CLOUD COVER TONIGHT...WILL KEEP                       
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER FOR TONIGHT. 925MB TEMPERATURES ARE                
EXPECTED TO BE 1 TO 2 DEGREE C WARMER OVER THE WEST TONIGHT AND                 
ABOUT THE SAME AS THIS MORNING OVER THE EAST. GUIDANCE SUGGESTING               
THE SAME.                                                                       
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL SHIFT INTO EASTERN ONTARIO AND BEGIN TO                
FLATTEN OUT ON MONDAY. MEANWHILE...THE SHORTWAVE RUNNING INTO THE               
RIDGE WILL DEVELOP INTO A CLOSED LOW WILL DIP SOUTHEAST EAST BELOW              
THE RIDGE AND MOVE INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. OTHER WEAK SHORTWAVES                
ROTATING AROUND THE CLOSED LOW WILL SWEEP INTO THE FORECAST AREA.               
THE MISSOURI SURFACE LOW WILL BE FORCED INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS. THE              
SURFACE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO STRETCH FROM EAST CENTRAL ONTARIO                
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THEN SOUTHWEST INTO EASTERN NEBRASKA...THE             
HIGH PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MEANDER INTO CENTRAL DAKOTAS. LOW               
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE VERY LIMITED AS THE ILLINOIS LOW             
WILL TEND TO KEEP THE MOISTURE CLOSE TO IT. GFS SUGGEST THAT THERE              
MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTH END OF MENOMINEE COUNTY TO                
PRODUCE SOME RAIN...HOWEVER...ECMWF/NAM/GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO               
SHOW IT WILL BE TOO DRY. THIS IS BECAUSE GFS IS MOST AGRESSIVE WITH             
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SURFACE LOW AND MOVING IT INTO LOWER                     
MICHIGAN. AS HPC POINTED OUT IN THE LATEST DISCUSSION...A PREFERRED             
NAM/GFS BLEND WOULD BE PREFERRED SOLUTION WHICH WOULD KEEP                      
PRECIPITATION MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE U.P. ON MONDAY. THIS IS                
ALSO SEEMS PREFERED BY THE ENSEMBLE SOLUTION.                                   
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL SHIFT INTO NORTHEAST IOWA MONDAY NIGHT. NAM              
CONTINUES TO KEEP THE LOW A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH OF GFS. NAM ALSO IS            
A LITTLE SOUTH OF AND LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SURFACE POSITION OF              
ASSOCIATED LOW. STILL LOOKING TO FAVOR A BLENDED SOLUTION SO WILL BE            
CUTTING BACK A LITTLE ON PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL. THE NAM CONTINUES             
TO BE A LITTLE SOUTH OF GFS SOLUTION FOR POSITIONS OF THE MID LOW ON            
TUESDAY...AS WELL AS BE QUITE BIT SOUTH AND LESS AGREESIVE WITH THE             
SURFACE LOW. THE POSITION OF THIS LOW WILL BE INSTUMENTAL IN THE                
DEVELOP OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE FORECAST AREA. GFS KEEP SHOWERS               
GOING OVER THE EAST PART OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY WHILE NAM              
KEEPS IT SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL CONTINUE WILL A SLIGHT CUT            
BACK ON CHANCE OF SHOWERS.                                                      
TWO WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL SWEEP THROUGH UPPER MICHIGAN TUESDAY NIGHT             
AS THE MID LEVEL LOW MOVES OVER THE KCHI AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL             
EDGE INTO SOUTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN. A WARM FRONT LEADING THE LOW WILL            
MOVE INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AS A TRAILING COLD FRONT SWEEPS INTO            
INDIANA. A WEAK RIDGE WILL MOVE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. DRY AIR                 
ACCOMPANYING THIS SYSTEM WILL CAUSE THE CHANCE OF RAIN TO DIMINISH              
OVER THE WEST END OF THE U.P. DRY AIR WILL BRING MORE SETTLE WEATHER            
TO THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY.

SKY COVER CONTINUES TO BE THE MAIN ISSUE IN THE SHORT TERM...AND NOW            
PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A SFC FRONT AND              
UPPER WAVE MOVE INTO THE AREA.                                                  
STRATUS DECK HOLDING THICK SOUTH OF A MBG-ABR-VVV LINE WITH CEILINGS            
FROM 500-2500 FT ALL THE WAY TO THE SD/NEB BORDER. NORTH OF THIS                
LINE A SCT-BKN025-040 CLOUD DECK EXISTS WITH A SHARP CUTOFF TO CLEAR            
SKIES JUST NORTH OF THE ND/SD BORDER. THIS HAS MATCHED UP WELL WITH             
MODEL 925MB RH FIELDS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. RUC/HI RES            
NAM WOULD SUGGEST A GRADUAL BREAKUP OF CLOUDS ACROSS CENTRAL SD THIS            
MORNING...BUT STRATUS BEING MORE STINGY ACROSS EASTERN SD AND                   
EXTREME WEST CENTRAL MN. HAVE LEFT SKY COVER GRIDS TO REFLECT A                 
MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE I-29              
CORRIDOR...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF SISSETON. HAVE ALSO ADDED MORNING FOG            
FROM PIERRE SOUTH AS VIS HAS BEEN COMING DOWN ALL MORNING AND IS NOW            
BETWEEN 1-2SM. OVERNIGHT STRATUS MAKES A RETURN TO THE NORTH AND                
WEST TO COVER MOST OF EASTERN SD AND WEST CENTRAL MINNESOTA AS 925MB            
FLOW PERSISTS FROM THE EAST/SOUTHEAST. THERE WAS SOME QUESTION AS TO            
JUST HOW FAR NORTH STRATUS WOULD ADVANCE SUNDAY NIGHT. MODELS SHOW A            
PLUME OF HIGH RH HEADING NORTH UP THE RED RIVER VALLEY SO HAVE                  
CLOUDY SKY GRIDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE EASTERN PORTION OF THE CWA.                  
STRATUS EARLY THIS MORNING STOPS AT THE ND/SD BORDER BUT 925MB WINDS            
ARE MORE ESE. MODELS SHOW WINDS TURNING MORE SE/SSE WHICH WOULD                 
SUGGEST STRATUS COULD ADVANCE FARTHER NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT THAN WHAT              
HAPPENED THIS MORNING. THINK STRATUS WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME                     
DEPARTING ON MONDAY ALSO AND KEPT SKY COVER RATHER HIGH ACROSS THE              
EASTERN COUNTIES INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.                                      
ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL DAKOTAS                  
MONDAY AFTERNOON. SFC TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL MT IS             
FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE WESTERN DAKOTAS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. NAM              
IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE FRONT AND BRINGS IT FARTHER EAST              
INTO CENTRAL DAKOTAS WHEREAS GFS LOOKS LIKE IT WANTS TO WASH IT OUT             
MONDAY EVENING. MINIMAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPS ACROSS WESTERN DAKOTAS             
MONDAY AFTERNOON AND A FEW MODELS ALSO SHOWING SMALL QPF ALONG                  
FRONT. HAVE INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE FAR NORTHWESTERN              
CWA FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON.                                                       
.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY                                           
MEDIUM RANGE IN FAIR AGREEMENT TODAY.  WILL END UP WITH A BLEND OF              
THE GFS AND THE HPC GUIDANCE.  THE EXTENDED PERIOD OPENS WITH H5                
UPPER RIDGE FOLDING OVER THE TOP OF THIS AREA AS A PACIFIC STORM                
SYSTEM MOVES ONSHORE NEAR THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST.  BY THURSDAY              
MORNING THE UPPER FLOW IN THIS AREA IS BECOMING SOUTHWEST AND COOLER            
PACIFIC AIR IS FORCING ITS WAY IN FROM THE NORTH.  THERE IS AN OLD              
BAROCLINIC ZONE LYING ALONG THE BORDER OF NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA.               
TRIMMED BACK THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION AS THIS MODEL RUN IS A                  
LITTLE SLOWER PUSHING INTO THE AREA.  FROM THAT POINT ON THE UPPER              
FLOW BECOMES INCREASINGLY SOUTHWEST AS THE PACIFIC LOW DIGS ALONG               
THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.   AFTER THIS IT WILL INVOLVE               
TIMING OF THE ENERGY THAT ROUNDS THE TROUGH BASE AS MOVES OUT ON THE            
PLAINS.  EXPECT THE TIMING OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE ABLE TO BE                  
SHAVED BACK CONSIDERABLY AS EACH WAVE BECOMES MORE CLEARLY DEFINED.             
AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THE PERIOD IS LONG                
DURATION LOW PROBABILITY POPS.  TEMPERATURES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE.

CLIMBING UNDER ABUNDANT SUNSHINE. ONLY EXCEPTION IS ACROSS PORTIONS

STRATOCU DEVELOPED OVER THE WATER AND IS AFFECTING THOSE LOCATIONS.             
WITH SFC RIDGE STILL LOCATED JUST NORTHEAST OF LAKE SUPERIOR OVER               
ONTARIO AND LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ADVECTIVE AFFECTS...AFTERNOON TEMPS            
SHOULD TOP OUT IN THE 60 TO 65 DEGREE RANGE TODAY. SAT IMAGERY                  
SHOWING UPPER LOW OVER SPINNING OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WITH LEADING            
EDGE OF CLOUD SHIELD MAKING SOME PROGRESS INTO NORTHERN WI. EXPECT              
THE DRIER AIR OVER THE REGION TO HOLD MOST OF THE CLOUDS AT BAY BUT             
MAY BEGIN TO SEE SOME OF THEM SPILL INTO WI BORDERING COUNTIES BY               
LATER THIS AFTERNOON. WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE MORNING

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 400 AM EDT SUN SEP 10 2006...                    
THE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE ARE THE OVERNIGHT LOWS             
TONIGHT AND CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT.                                     
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC SHOWING A NEAR ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE                
SOUTH HALF OF CONUS...A LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA...A                 
RIDGE OVER CENTRAL CANADA...AND ANOTHER LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER GULF OF            
ALASKA. A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRAPPED IN THE NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS NORTH             
AMERICA IS OVER SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA STRETCHING INTO NORTHERN                   
MINNESOTA. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IS OVER EASTERN ONTARIO WORKING ITS WAY            
THROUGH THE BASE OF THE EASTERN CANADIAN TROUGH. SURFACE ANALYSIS               
INSIST THAT A STATIONARY FRONT STRETCHES FROM KWDC THROUGH THE                  
SOUTHERN OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO A LOW OVER NORTH CENTRAL KANSAS. A                
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE BLANKETS ONTARIO...SOUTHERN QUEBEC AND              
THE GREAT LAKES REGION. A FRONTAL SYSTEM IS DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN            
CANADIAN PRAIRIE AND OVER THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS OF CONUS. A FEW              
THUNDERSTORMS AND SHOWERS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVERNIGHT IN                      
ASSOCIATION WITH THE LOW OVER KANSAS.                                           
THE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE VERY LITTLE TODAY AS WILL THE RIDGE               
OVER CENTRAL CANADA. THE SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL              
REMAIN DOMINATE OVER THE REGION. PRECIPITABLE WATER WILL BE AROUND              
.5 INCH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE             
A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION AROUND 850MB OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE             
925MB TEMPERATURES ARE PROGGED TO BE CLOSE TO THE SAME AS                       
YESTERDAY'S... EXCEPT A LITTLE WARMER OVER THE EASTERN U.P. EVEN THE            
TRAJECTORY PROGS INDICATE VERY LITTLE CHANCE IN AIR MASS.                       
HOWEVER...TODAY THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATING A LITTLE LESS LOW             
LEVEL CLOUDS. THUS MAY EXPECT A LITTLE WARMER TEMPERATURES DUE TO               
THE ADDITIONAL SUN. PLAN TO GO WITH JUST A LITTLE HIGHER                        
TEMPERATURES THAN YESTERDAYS WHICH IS WHAT GUIDANCE SUGGEST ALSO.               
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL SLIDE INTO WESTERN ONTARIO TONIGHT WHILE               
THE SURFACE RIDGE PUSHES INTO SOUTHWEST QUEBEC. A SHORTWAVE WILL RUN            
INTO THE RIDGE AND START TO BREAK IT DOWN. THE SURFACE LOW OVER                 
KANSAS WILL TRAVEL INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI...PULLING A PORTION OF THE            
FRONTAL SYSTEM NORTHERN INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS AND CENTRAL INDIANA.              
THE ACCOMPANYING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER RUNNING THE FRONT WILL                 
SHIFT INTO SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND INTO LOWER MICHIGAN...STILL KEEP              
THE FORECAST AREA DRY. A 70 KNOT UPPER LEVEL JET MAX WILL SLIDE                 
ACROSS NORTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN TONIGHT. KEEPING THE FORECAST AREA               
UNDER THE LEFT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET MAX. THUS WITH THE DRY AIR            
ENTRENCHED OVER THE FORECAST AREA PLAN TO KEEP THE FORECAST AREA                
DRY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SHOW A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE                
FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT EXCEPT ALONG THE LAKE MICHIGAN SHORELINE.             
GFS SOUNDING DRAWING CLOUDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 500MB AND             
ABOVE. THIS MAY REDUCE RADIATIONAL COOLING. WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF SUN            
FOR TODAY AND AN INCREASE CLOUD COVER TONIGHT...WILL KEEP                       
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER FOR TONIGHT. 925MB TEMPERATURES ARE                
EXPECTED TO BE 1 TO 2 DEGREE C WARMER OVER THE WEST TONIGHT AND                 
ABOUT THE SAME AS THIS MORNING OVER THE EAST. GUIDANCE SUGGESTING               
THE SAME.                                                                       
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL SHIFT INTO EASTERN ONTARIO AND BEGIN TO                
FLATTEN OUT ON MONDAY. MEANWHILE...THE SHORTWAVE RUNNING INTO THE               
RIDGE WILL DEVELOP INTO A CLOSED LOW WILL DIP SOUTHEAST EAST BELOW              
THE RIDGE AND MOVE INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. OTHER WEAK SHORTWAVES                
ROTATING AROUND THE CLOSED LOW WILL SWEEP INTO THE FORECAST AREA.               
THE MISSOURI SURFACE LOW WILL BE FORCED INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS. THE              
SURFACE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO STRETCH FROM EAST CENTRAL ONTARIO                
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THEN SOUTHWEST INTO EASTERN NEBRASKA...THE             
HIGH PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MEANDER INTO CENTRAL DAKOTAS. LOW               
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE VERY LIMITED AS THE ILLINOIS LOW             
WILL TEND TO KEEP THE MOISTURE CLOSE TO IT. GFS SUGGEST THAT THERE              
MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTH END OF MENOMINEE COUNTY TO                
PRODUCE SOME RAIN...HOWEVER...ECMWF/NAM/GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO               
SHOW IT WILL BE TOO DRY. THIS IS BECAUSE GFS IS MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH            
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SURFACE LOW AND MOVING IT INTO LOWER                     
MICHIGAN. AS HPC POINTED OUT IN THE LATEST DISCUSSION...A PREFERRED             
NAM/GFS BLEND WOULD BE PREFERRED SOLUTION WHICH WOULD KEEP                      
PRECIPITATION MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE U.P. ON MONDAY. THIS IS                
ALSO SEEMS PREFERRED BY THE ENSEMBLE SOLUTION.                                  
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL SHIFT INTO NORTHEAST IOWA MONDAY NIGHT. NAM              
CONTINUES TO KEEP THE LOW A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH OF GFS. NAM ALSO IS            
A LITTLE SOUTH OF AND LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SURFACE POSITION OF              
ASSOCIATED LOW. STILL LOOKING TO FAVOR A BLENDED SOLUTION SO WILL BE            
CUTTING BACK A LITTLE ON PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL. THE NAM CONTINUES             
TO BE A LITTLE SOUTH OF GFS SOLUTION FOR POSITIONS OF THE MID LOW ON            
TUESDAY...AS WELL AS BE QUITE BIT SOUTH AND LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE            
SURFACE LOW. THE POSITION OF THIS LOW WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE               
DEVELOP OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE FORECAST AREA. GFS KEEP SHOWERS               
GOING OVER THE EAST PART OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY WHILE NAM              
KEEPS IT SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL CONTINUE WILL A SLIGHT CUT            
BACK ON CHANCE OF SHOWERS.                                                      
TWO WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL SWEEP THROUGH UPPER MICHIGAN TUESDAY NIGHT             
AS THE MID LEVEL LOW MOVES OVER THE KCHI AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL             
EDGE INTO SOUTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN. A WARM FRONT LEADING THE LOW WILL            
MOVE INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AS A TRAILING COLD FRONT SWEEPS INTO            
INDIANA. A WEAK RIDGE WILL MOVE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. DRY AIR                 
ACCOMPANYING THIS SYSTEM WILL CAUSE THE CHANCE OF RAIN TO DIMINISH              
OVER THE WEST END OF THE U.P. DRY AIR WILL BRING MORE SETTLE WEATHER

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR                 
SHORELINE EMBEDDED UNDER NW FLOW ALOFT.  VERY DRY AIR IS PRESENT                
ACROSS THE CWA AS DEPICTED BY THE 12Z APX SOUNDING WITH PWATS AT                
0.32...WITH MOST OF THE MOISTURE RESIDING BELOW THE 825MB                       
INVERSION.  A SCT-BKN050 DECK AS BEEN PRESENT FOR MOST OF THE                   
MORNING ACROSS FAR NE LOWER WHILE THE REST OF THE CWA REMAINS MOSTLY            
CLEAR NORTH OF M-72.  MEANWHILE...A THICK BAND OF CLOUDS ORIGINATING            
FROM CONVECTION AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE AND DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE                
OVER KANSAS IS STREAMING NORTHEAST ACROSS CENTRAL WI/MI...JUST SOUTH            
OF THE CWA.  THIS MOISTURE IS HITTING A WALL OF DRY AIR (850-500MB              
RH 15-25%)...ALIGNED WELL WITH THE 700 MB FRONT.  WITH STRONG HIGH              
PRESSURE IN CONTROL...CLOUD COVER AND MAX TEMPS REMAIN THE MAIN                 
CONCERN THIS AFTERNOON.                                                         
EASTERLY WINDS IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL PERSISTENTLY ADVECT MOISTURE              
OFF OF LAKE HURON OVER NE LOWER AND THE TIP OF THE MITT THIS                    
AFTERNOON WHICH WILL PROMOTE CU DEVELOPMENT.  THE REST OF THE CWA               
SHOULD SEE SHALLOW CU DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL MIX OUT DURING THE                 
COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON LEAVING SKIES PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY.  THE              
EXCEPTION WILL OCCUR OVER THE SOUTHERN CWA.  THE 700MB FRONT THAT IS            
BASICALLY THE EDGE OF THE MID LEVEL CLOUD SHIELD...WILL MOVE SLOWLY             
NORTH TODAY AND THINK THAT THESE CLOUDS WILL MAKE IT TO A LINE                  
EXTENDING FROM TVC TO OSC.  OTHERWISE...A QUIET DAY ON TAP WITH                 
HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 60S.                                               
MARINE...MID-LAKE BUOYS ARE ONLY SHOWING WINDS GUSTING BETWEEN                  
10-15KTS AND WAVES ARE UNDER THREE FEET.  THIS MATCHES UP WELL WITH             
THE NOAA GREAT LAKES WAVE MODEL FORECASTS.  WITH WINDS EXPECTED TO              
REMAIN STEADY THIS AFTERNOON...HAVE A HARD TIME JUSTIFYING KEEPING              
THE SMALL CRAFTS GOING SINCE WAVES LOOK TO BE IN THE 2 TO 4 FT                  
RANGE...STILL CHOPPY BUT UNDER SMALL CRAFT CRITERIA.                            
ZONES OUT SHORTLY

LATEST NORTHERN HEMISPHERIC WATER VAPOR IMAGERY EARLY THIS MORNING              
SHOWING ENERGETIC MID LEVEL FLOW ACROSS NOAM WITH LONGWAVE TROUGH               
AXIS DIGGING INTO THE GULF OF ALASKA AND ANOTHER LIFTING EAST OVER              
EASTERN CANADA/NORTHEASTERN CONUS. SANDWICHED BETWEEN THESE IS A MID            
LEVEL RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE CANADIAN HIGH PLAINS TO THE                 
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. MORE SUBTLE SHORTWAVES ALSO EVIDENT...ONE                
DROPPING SOUTH OVER SOUTHWEST MANITOBA WITH ANOTHER MOVING EAST OVER            
NEBRASKA. AT THE SURFACE...1028 MB HIGH PRESSURE IS SLOWLY SLIDING              
SOUTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO WITH FRONTAL ZONE WELL SOUTH IN               
THE OHIO VALLEY. COOL NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW (850 MB TEMPERATURES               
AROUND 2-3C) ROTATING AROUND HIGH GENERATING A RATHER EXTENSIVE AREA            
OF STRATOCUMULUS OVER NORTHERN LAKE HURON AS DELTA T/S APPROACH 16C.            
CLOUD DECK MAKING SLOW BUT STEADY PROGRESS INLAND AS IT FIGHTS VERY             
DRY AIR WITH PWATS PER 00Z APX SOUNDING OF ONLY 0.36 INCHES OR ABOUT            
48 PERCENT OF NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. LOOKING WAY OUT INTO THE            
ATLANTIC...TROPICAL STORM FLORENCE BEGINNING TO MAKE LEFT HAND TURN             
SOUTH OF BERMUDA AS IT FEELS AFFECTS OF NORTHEAST CONUS TROUGH (SEE             
WWW.NHC.NOAA.GOV FOR LATEST FORECAST ON FLORENCE). FORECAST CONCERNS            
CENTERED ON CLOUDS AND TEMPERATURES THROUGH TONIGHT THEN INCREASING             
PRECIPITATION CHANCES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.                                    
TODAY...LAKE EFFECT CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FACTOR ALONG AND               
EAST OF M-33 THIS MORNING AS WINDS COME AROUND TO A MORE EASTERLY               
DIRECTION AND MODERATE DELTA T/S REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR CLOUD                     
GENERATION. EXPECT MUCH THE SAME TO HAPPEN TODAY AS YESTERDAY WITH              
CLOUDS MIXING OUT LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON WITH ALL THE MID             
LEVEL DRY AIR PRESENT. DID BUMP UP CLOUD COVERAGE A LITTLE IN                   
SOUTHERN AREAS AS EXPANSIVE MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUD SHIELD                    
SPREADING EAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS LOOKS TO CLIP THESE AREAS.               
TEMPERATURES TODAY LOOKING TO STAY WELL BELOW SEASONAL NORMS WITH               
HIGHS ONLY MAKING IT TO THE LOWER 60S.                                          
TONIGHT...LAKE CLOUDS LOOK TO SPREAD BACK INTO EASTERN AREAS AS 850             
MB TEMPERATURES OVER NORTHERN LAKE HURON FALL TO AROUND 1-2C AND                
EASTERLY FLOW CONTINUES. HIGH CLOUDS SPREADING WELL IN ADVANCE OF               
DEVELOPING CENTRAL PLAINS STORM SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE INTO SOUTHERN                
ZONES. THEREFORE...BUMPED UP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES IN THESE                
AREAS. ELSEWHERE...STILL EXPECTING PATCHY FROST IN THE TYPICAL                  
COLDER LOCATION OF THE NORTHERN LOWER AND EASTERN UPPER WITH LOWS               
FALLING INTO THE MID 30S. AROUND THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA EXPECT               
LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S.                                             
MONDAY...SIGNIFICANT CHANGES STARTING WITH THIS PERIOD AS                       
AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVES CONSOLIDATE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. LAST            
SEVERAL RUNS FROM VARIOUS MODELS...EXCLUDING THE GFS...DAMPENED THIS            
SYSTEM AS IT ENCOUNTERED EASTERN TROUGH AXIS WHICH IN TURN FORCED               
SYSTEM TO REMAIN WELL SOUTH OF REGION. HOWEVER...LATEST 00Z UKMET               
AND GFS ALMOST A SPOT ON MATCH WITH CLOSED MID LEVEL CIRCULATION                
OVER EASTERN MINNESOTA BY MONDAY EVENING AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW             
OVER CENTRAL ILLINOIS. FURTHER SUPPORT PROVIDED BY TRENDS IN BOTH               
00Z NAM-WRF AND 12Z ECMWF OF A MORE WRAPPED UP AND FARTHER NORTH                
SOLUTION...ALBEIT STILL A BIT FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE UKMET/GFS                  
SOLUTIONS. OVERALL EVOLUTION LOOKS TO HINGE ON INTERACTION BETWEEN              
FLORENCE AND EAST COAST TROUGH AND HOW FAST COMBINED SYSTEMS PULL               
OUT. A MORE ESTABLISHED EASTERN TROUGH WOULD FAVOR A FARTHER SOUTH              
AND MORE DAMPENED SOLUTION AS CENTRAL PLAINS ENERGY APPROACHES WOULD            
BE CONFLUENT ZONE OVER THE LAKES. AT THIS TIME WILL HEDGE FORECAST              
TOWARDS RATHER CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION WITH SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF             
A POTENTIALLY FARTHER SOUTH PLACEMENT. WHAT ALL THIS MEANS FOR OUR              
AREA IS TO ADD SOME LOW POPS FAR SOUTHERN ZONES MONDAY AFTERNOON AS             
WARM FRONT BEGINS TO BOW NORTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN LAKES AND                    
ISENTROPIC ASCENT INCREASES. WILL DOWNPLAY OVER ZEALOUS GFS QPF                 
FIELDS FOR MONDAY AS DRY AIR IN PLACE WILL BE HARD INITIALLY TO                 
SCOUR OUT.                                                                      
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...ADDED POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD             
AS LOW MOVES UP THROUGH SOUTHERN MICHIGAN PUTTING OUR AREA IN                   
FAVORABLE DEFORMATION ZONE. GFS DOES SHOW SOME IMPRESSIVE 300-305K              
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WITH MIXING RATIONS APPROACHING 8G/KG MONDAY                  
NIGHT. DID NOT WANT TO GO OVERBOARD ON POPS GIVEN MODEL                         
DISCREPANCIES. IF GFS/UKMET VERIFY LIKELY POPS WILL BE NEEDED FOR               
MUCH OF THIS PERIOD.                                                            
REST OF FORECAST UNCHANGED.                                                     
MARINE...WILL GO AHEAD AND EXTEND SCA FROM PRESQUE ISLE LIGHT TO                
ALABASTER THROUGH 00Z MONDAY. CONTINUATION OF IMPRESSIVE OVER LAKE              
INSTABILITY AND LONG EASTERLY FETCH WILL ALLOW WAVES TO CONTINUE IN             
THE 3-5 FOOT RANGE.

.UPDATE...REVISITED MAX T GRID ACROSS THE EASTERN FA WITH IFR                   
STRATUS DECK WELL ESTABLISHED ACROSS THIS AREA. NOT EXPECTING ANY

SEE THE MERCURY RISE GREATER THAN A CATEGORY-WORTH OF TEMPERATURE               
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. ALSO NEEDED TO TWEAK SKYCOVER GRIDS WHICH               
ARE A BARE TO FORECAST TODAY WRT WHEN AND WHERE ANY AREAS MAY                   
DISSIPATE ENTIRELY OR JUST SCATTER OUT. UPDATED GRIDS/WORDS ARE OUT.

SKY COVER CONTINUES TO BE THE MAIN ISSUE IN THE SHORT TERM...AND NOW            
PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A SFC FRONT AND              
UPPER WAVE MOVE INTO THE AREA.                                                  
STRATUS DECK HOLDING THICK SOUTH OF A MBG-ABR-VVV LINE WITH CEILINGS            
FROM 500-2500 FT ALL THE WAY TO THE SD/NEB BORDER. NORTH OF THIS                
LINE A SCT-BKN025-040 CLOUD DECK EXISTS WITH A SHARP CUTOFF TO CLEAR            
SKIES JUST NORTH OF THE ND/SD BORDER. THIS HAS MATCHED UP WELL WITH             
MODEL 925MB RH FIELDS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. RUC/HI RES            
NAM WOULD SUGGEST A GRADUAL BREAKUP OF CLOUDS ACROSS CENTRAL SD THIS            
MORNING...BUT STRATUS BEING MORE STINGY ACROSS EASTERN SD AND                   
EXTREME WEST CENTRAL MN. HAVE LEFT SKY COVER GRIDS TO REFLECT A                 
MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE I-29              
CORRIDOR...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF SISSETON. HAVE ALSO ADDED MORNING FOG            
FROM PIERRE SOUTH AS VIS HAS BEEN COMING DOWN ALL MORNING AND IS NOW            
BETWEEN 1-2SM. OVERNIGHT STRATUS MAKES A RETURN TO THE NORTH AND                
WEST TO COVER MOST OF EASTERN SD AND WEST CENTRAL MINNESOTA AS 925MB            
FLOW PERSISTS FROM THE EAST/SOUTHEAST. THERE WAS SOME QUESTION AS TO            
JUST HOW FAR NORTH STRATUS WOULD ADVANCE SUNDAY NIGHT. MODELS SHOW A            
PLUME OF HIGH RH HEADING NORTH UP THE RED RIVER VALLEY SO HAVE                  
CLOUDY SKY GRIDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE EASTERN PORTION OF THE CWA.                  
STRATUS EARLY THIS MORNING STOPS AT THE ND/SD BORDER BUT 925MB WINDS            
ARE MORE ESE. MODELS SHOW WINDS TURNING MORE SE/SSE WHICH WOULD                 
SUGGEST STRATUS COULD ADVANCE FARTHER NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT THAN WHAT              
HAPPENED THIS MORNING. THINK STRATUS WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME                     
DEPARTING ON MONDAY ALSO AND KEPT SKY COVER RATHER HIGH ACROSS THE              
EASTERN COUNTIES INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.                                      
ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL DAKOTAS                  
MONDAY AFTERNOON. SFC TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL MT IS             
FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE WESTERN DAKOTAS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. NAM              
IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE FRONT AND BRINGS IT FARTHER EAST              
INTO CENTRAL DAKOTAS WHEREAS GFS LOOKS LIKE IT WANTS TO WASH IT OUT             
MONDAY EVENING. MINIMAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPS ACROSS WESTERN DAKOTAS             
MONDAY AFTERNOON AND A FEW MODELS ALSO SHOWING SMALL QPF ALONG                  
FRONT. HAVE INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE FAR NORTHWESTERN              
CWA FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON.                                                       
LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY                                            
MEDIUM RANGE IN FAIR AGREEMENT TODAY.  WILL END UP WITH A BLEND OF              
THE GFS AND THE HPC GUIDANCE.  THE EXTENDED PERIOD OPENS WITH H5                
UPPER RIDGE FOLDING OVER THE TOP OF THIS AREA AS A PACIFIC STORM                
SYSTEM MOVES ONSHORE NEAR THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST.  BY THURSDAY              
MORNING THE UPPER FLOW IN THIS AREA IS BECOMING SOUTHWEST AND COOLER            
PACIFIC AIR IS FORCING ITS WAY IN FROM THE NORTH.  THERE IS AN OLD              
BAROCLINIC ZONE LYING ALONG THE BORDER OF NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA.               
TRIMMED BACK THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION AS THIS MODEL RUN IS A                  
LITTLE SLOWER PUSHING INTO THE AREA.  FROM THAT POINT ON THE UPPER              
FLOW BECOMES INCREASINGLY SOUTHWEST AS THE PACIFIC LOW DIGS ALONG               
THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.   AFTER THIS IT WILL INVOLVE               
TIMING OF THE ENERGY THAT ROUNDS THE TROUGH BASE AS MOVES OUT ON THE            
PLAINS.  EXPECT THE TIMING OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE ABLE TO BE                  
SHAVED BACK CONSIDERABLY AS EACH WAVE BECOMES MORE CLEARLY DEFINED.             
AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THE PERIOD IS LONG                
DURATION LOW PROBABILITY POPS.  TEMPERATURES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE.

NORTH AND EAST OF THE BRO CWA FOR THE MOMENT. HOWEVER...THE 12Z BRO

THE SHORT TERM. AFTERNOON HEATING WILL ALSO ENHANCE THE LOW LEVEL               
CONVERGENCE AND LIFT LATER TODAY WHICH WILL HELP REGERATE ADDITIONAL            
CONV LATER TODAY AND INTO THE EARLY EVENING.  MAV TEMPERATURES FOR              
THIS AFTERNOON MAY BE A BIT HIGH CONSIDERING THE INCREASED POTENTIAL            
FOR CONV AND CLD COVER. SO WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY COOLER MET            
NUMBERS.  ALTHOUGH THE RAINFALL FROM YESTERDAY HAS CONSIDERABLY                 
LOWERED THE FFG FOR THE REGION...THE GUIDANCE IS STILL PRETTY HIGH              
AND BELIEVE THAT THE GROUND WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO HANDLE ANY                   
ADDITIONAL HVY RAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.  ALSO THE AREAL COVERAGE OF              
THE CONV HAS BEEN SPREAD OUT ENOUGH AND THE CELLULAR MOVEMENT HAS               
BEEN PRETTY FAST TO LIMIT THE HVY RAIN COVERAGE AND DURATION.  SO DO            
NOT BELIEVE THAT A FFA IS NEEDED AT THE MOMENT. HOWEVER...HAVE                  
UPDATED THE ZFP TO MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE.

PRODUCE LIGHT SOUTHEAST FLOW THROUGH TUESDAY. AN UNSTABLE AIRMASS               
AND WEAK COASTAL TROUGHING WILL LEAD TO CONTINUED SHOWER AND                    
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. MARINERS CAN EXPECT BRIEF HEAVY

SHIFTING WINDS TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST. SEAS WILL REMAIN 1 TO 2

MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE WILL BE TIMING AND COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION            
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.                                                         
CURRENTLY...CU AND TOWERING CU DEVELOPING OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND                
HIGH VALLEYS EARLY THIS AFTERNOON PER VISIBLE AND INFRARED SATELLITE            
IMAGERY ANIMATIONS. MORE STABLE SC WAS ACROSS MUCH OF EASTERN CO                
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS IS IN THE AREA OF A STRONGER CONVECTIVE              
INHIBITION REGION PER LAPS DATA AND CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES NOT                 
REACHED YET. REGIONAL RADARS SHOWING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS              
AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT VALUES. SURFACE               
BASED CAPES ARE 200-1000 J/KG OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGH VALLEYS               
WITH LIFTED INDICES -2C TO -4C. POTENTIAL FOR MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL              
POSSIBLE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC MODEL UPPER AIR ANALYSES AGAIN            
SHOWING FLAT WESTERLY FLOW. THERE ARE VERY MINOR SHORTWAVE TROUGHS              
RIPPLING THROUGH THIS FLOW ACROSS UT AND CO. FIRST LIGHTNING STRIKES            
SHOWED UP IN WEST CENTRAL CO JUST AHEAD OF ONE OF THESE SHORTWAVES              
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.                                                           
TONIGHT...TOUGH CALL IN SAYING WHICH CWFA AREA WILL HAVE THE BETTER             
CHANCE FOR POPS AND QPF...SO CURRENTLY BROADBRUSH POP SCENARIO LOOKS            
GOOD. THE BETTER THREAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN              
FOOTHILLS AND EASTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN CO PLAINS. THE NEXT                
CHALLENGE IS WHEN WILL THE PRECIPITATION CHANCES END. THE 12KM WRF              
CONTINUES TO BE OVERDOING PRECIPITATION DEVELOPMENT AND ENDING. I               
CANNOT SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT SYNOPTIC SCALE SYSTEM KEEPING THE                    
PRECIPITATION GOING AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHEAST CO. I               
GUESS A ROGUE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY COULD KEEP THINGS GOING...BUT THE AIR            
MASS BECOMES MORE STABLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. AFTER LOOKING AT LAST                  
NIGHTS...RADAR...LIGHTNING...AND SATELLITE DATA...WILL DROP MUCH OF             
THE POP AND PRECIPITATING WEATHER AFTER MIDNIGHT EXCEPT FOR SOME LOW            
POPS DOWN AROUND THE SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS AND PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN CO            
PLAINS. MY GUT SAYS THAT MIGHT BE OVERDONE GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD OF            
THE 12KM WRF (AND THE GFS TYPICALLY HANGING ONTO TO TOO MUCH                    
PRECIPITATION). MINIMUM TEMPERATURES STARTING TO BECOME MORE OF A               
CHALLENGE IN LOW LYING AREAS AS FALL APPROACHES. THE HEART OF THE               
SAN LUIS VALLEY GOT DOWN TO THE MIDDLE 30S(ALS..34F) AND KPUB WAS               
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE 40S...WHICH WERE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE YESTERDAY.               
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE SFC-PBL TO BECOME MOIST TOWARDS MORNING                  
ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN CO AND THE SAN LUIS VALLEY...SO THE POTENTIAL               
FOR PATCHY (GROUND) FOG CONTINUES. CURRENT DIGITAL FORECAST DATABASE            
HAD MENTION FROM KCOS DOWN TO KLAA...SO WILL CONTINUE AND LINK TO RH            
VALUES OF 95% OR GREATER. ALSO INCLUDED PATCHY FOG IN SAN LUIS                  
VALLEY. ACTUALLY SOME FROST MAY BE POSSIBLE OF TEMPERATURES CAN GET             
DOWN TO 32F-33F WITH HUMIDITY VALUES GREATER THAN 90 PERCENT.                   
MONDAY...POTENTIAL FOR SOME EARLY MORNING (GROUND) FOG IN                       
AFOREMENTIONED AREAS. OTHERWISE...PERSISTENCE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD                
FORECAST TOOL. WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGHS SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE                   
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW. TRIED TO ENHANCE THE PRECIPITATION TIMING AND               
STARTING THE POTENTIAL OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGH VALLEYS EARLY IN             
THE AFTERNOON AND THEN SPREAD THE POTENTIAL ACROSS ALL OF THE CWFA              
MIDDLE TO LATE AFTERNOON. AGAIN...THINK 12KM WRF IS STARTING                    
PRECIPITATION TOO EARLY. STILL TOUGH TO PIN-POINT THE BEST POP QPF              
AREAS...SO A MORE BROADBRUSH LOW POPS IS PROBABLY THE WAY TO GO.                
CURRENT MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES LOOK ON TARGET AND CLOSE ENOUGH TO MOS             
GUIDANCE...SO LITTLE ALTERATIONS NEEDED THERE. METZE

THE NORTHERN ROCKIES ON FRIDAY. WITH WARM AIR ALOFT (+10C TO +14C               
AT H7) AND DEVELOPING DOWNSLOPE FLOW...SHOULD SEE TEMPS WARMING TO              
ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGES THROUGH THE PERIOD. WITH SOME INCREASING                
MOISTURE IN THE SW FLOW...HAVE KEPT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED POPS

FCST CONCERN FOCUSES ON TIMING OF RAIN INTO FCST AREA MON INTO TUE

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...12Z RAOBS AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW RIDGE                     
CONTINUING TO AMPLIFY OVER THE WRN CONUS WHILE HURRICANE EMILY IS               
MOVING NORTH THROUGH THE ATLANTIC TOWARD MID-LVL TROUGH OVER ERN                
CANADA. THIS ALL POINTS TOWARD DEVELOPMENT OF MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGH             
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MIDWEST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...AND            
GFS/UKMET AND NOW CANADIAN ALL ADVERTISE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE                    
AMPLIFIED TROUGH AND CLOSED LOW OCCURRING OVER THE MIDWEST AND WRN              
LAKES.                                                                          
TONIGHT...CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE SCNTRL COUNTIES LOOK LIKE THEY MAY            
BE ENHANCED SOME BY UPSLOPE/ONSHORE SE FLOW OFF NRN LAKE MI/BAY OF              
GREEN BAY. WOULD EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF THE             
NIGHT AS LEADING EDGE OF CIRRUS CLOUD SHIELD FROM CENTRAL PLAINS                
SYSTEM ADVANCES NORTH TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. VERY DRY AIR AS             
EVIDENCED BY 12Z KAPX AND KINL SNDGS MAY TEND TO KEEP THICKER CLOUDS            
FROM REACHING INTO NRN TIER COUNTIES OF FCST AREA...BUT DO EXPECT               
SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS OVER SRN COUNTIES. CLOUDS WILL OBVIOUSLY                
IMPACT MIN TEMPS TONIGHT...BUT STILL THINK THERE WILL BE ENOUGH OF A            
PERIOD OF CLEARING TO ALLOW FOR SOME DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING TO              
OCCUR. WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE SOME PATCHY FROST FOR INLAND                    
LOCATIONS OF FAR WRN...NCNTRL AND ERN COUNTIES WITH TEMPS REACHING              
THE MID TO UPR 30S IN SOME SPOTS. TEMPS WILL STAY MORE IN THE 40S               
ALONG THE SHORELINE AREAS AND FOR FAR SCNTRL COUNTIES WHERE HIGH                
CLOUDS WILL THICKEN.                                                            
AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY FROM ERN ND AND NRN MN DIGS INTO CENTRAL PLAINS             
TROUGH...TONIGHT INTO MON...MID-LVL TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO TAKE ON               
MORE NEGATIVE TILT CARVING OUT CLOSED LOW OVER SRN MN PER GFS/UKMET.            
ASSOCIATED SFC SYSTEM AND INVERTED TROUGH WILL TEND TO PUSH NORTH               
TOWARD THE UPR GREAT LAKES. INCREASING 300K ISENTROPIC ASCENT AHEAD             
OF SYSTEM WILL DRIVE CLOUDS/PCPN NORTH TOWARD UPR MI ON MON. BELIEVE            
12Z GFS MAY STILL BE TOO QUICK TO DRIVE PCPN NORTH GIVEN VERY AIR IN            
PLACE. SO FOLLOWED CANADIAN/UKMET SOLNS MORE FOR TIMING OF PCPN                 
BRINGING IN CHC OF PCPN BY LATE AFT MON FOR FAR SCNTRL COUNTIES THEN            
SPREAD CHC POPS NORTH ACROSS THE REST OF CENTRAL AND ERN FCST AREA              
MON NIGHT INTO TUE WITH SLIGHT CHC POPS OVER THE WRN COUNTIES. EVEN             
WENT LIKELY POPS ACROSS FAR SE LOCATIONS ON EDGE OF BETTER 300K                 
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AS INDICATED BY FCST MODELS. TAPERED OFF OR ENDED             
RAIN FROM WEST TUE NIGHT INTO WED AS MODEL CONSENSUS SHOWS SYSTEM               
AND ASSOC BEST ISENTROPIC LIFT MOVING WELL E OF THE FCST AREA BY

405 PM EDT SUN SEP 10 2006                                                      
.DISCUSSION...18Z SURFACE/RUC ANALYSIS AND VIS/IR/WV IMAGERY SHOWS A            
BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE GULF OF ALASKA AND A TROUGH                   
LIFTING TO THE NE OVER QUEBEC.  A RATHER BROAD RIDGE IS CENTERED                
OVER CENTRAL MANITOBA AND SASKETCHEWON.  OVER THE GREAT PLAINS... A             
SHORTWAVE IS HELPING DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW OVER EASTERN KANSAS WITH             
A WARM FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN IL.  ISENTROPIC             
LIFT ON THE 300K AND 305K SURFACES IS HELPING TO PRODUCE AN AREA OF             
LIGHT RAIN ACROSS NORTHERN IL/SOUTHERN WI...BUT IS HAVING A HARD                
TIME MAKING IT ACROSS LAKE MICHIGAN.  ELSEWHERE...STRONG SURFACE                
HIGH CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN ONTARIO PLACING THE CWA IN DRY ENE LOW              
LEVEL FLOW.  THIS FLOW HAS BEEN ADVECTING MOISTURE FROM LAKE HURON              
ACROSS NE AND NORTH CENTRAL LOWER MICHIGAN KEEPING SKIES PARTLY TO              
MOSTLY CLOUDY UNDER A STRATU-CU FIELD.  ONE SHOWER WAS REPORTED AT              
ALPENA THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH PRESSURE AND STRONG SUBSIDENCE WILL KEEP            
PRECIP AT BAY...AND THEREFORE...CLOUDS AND TEMPS ARE THE MAIN                   
FORECAST CONCERNS TONIGHT...THEN THE ATTENTION TURNS TO PRECIP FROM             
THE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS TOMORROW.                                            
TONIGHT...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES EAST OVER WESTERN QUEBEC WITH            
ITS RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING WEST ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO AND LAKE                  
SUPERIOR. VERY DRY AIR EASTERLY FLOW FROM THIS HIGH PRESSURE WITH               
PWATS OF 0.4-0.5IN WILL REMAIN OVER AREA.  THIS EASTERLY FLOW WILL              
KEEP ADVECTING MOISTURE FROM LAKE HURON ONSHORE (LAKE-850MB TEMP                
DIFFERENCE AROUND 16C)...BUT WILL KEEP SKIES SCATTERED ACROSS NE                
LOWER WITH SUCH DRY LOW LEVELS ABOVE 850MB.  A SIMILAR PROFILE                  
EXISTED LAST NIGHT AND SKIES REMAINED SCATTERED FOR THE MOST PART.              
MEANWHILE...LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER KANSAS WILL SLOWLY MOVE NE             
OVER NORTHERN MO.  CONVECTIVE DEBRIS AND ISENTROPIC LIFT ON THE 305K            
AND 310K LEVELS WILL SPREAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS FROM NORTH TO            
SOUTH OVER NORTHERN LOWER.  THE VERY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE WILL SLOW             
DOWN THE MOISTURE ADVANCEMENT...BUT SHOULD WORK ITS WAY OVER MUCH OF            
NORTHERN LOWER. ANY PRECIP SHOULD STAY TO THE SOUTH WITH THE VERY               
DRY LOW LEVELS (850-700MB RH 15-30%).  THESE CLOUDS WILL KEEP                   
TEMPERATURES MUCH WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT...BUT COULD SEE TEMPS                  
DIPPING INTO THE MIDDLE 30S ACROSS INLAND AREAS OF THE TIP OF THE               
MITT WHERE CLOUDS WILL ARRIVE LAST.  WILL KEEP PATCHY FROST ACROSS              
EASTERN UPPER WHERE SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR.                             
MARINE...EAST WINDS 10 TO 15 KNOTS AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS OVER THE             
LAKES WILL PRODUCE WAVES IN THE 2 TO 4 FOOT RANGE BUT UNDER SMALL               
CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA.

MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...STILL SIGNIFICANT MODEL DIFFERENCES AND              
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY THROUGH MIDWEEK IN REGARD TO MID LEVEL                     
TROUGH/PSEUDO CUTOFF FEATURE FORECAST TO DEEPEN OVER THE MIDWEST...             
SLOWLY WORK THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY...AND NORTHWARD                 
PROGRESSION OF AN ASSOCIATED SFC LOW AND PRECIP INTO NRN MICHIGAN.              
GFS/UKMET STILL THE DEEPEST AND FURTHEST NORTH COMPARED TO THE                  
NAM/ECMWF AND EVEN THE NGM (REMEMBER THE NGM?). 12Z NAM/GFS                     
INITIALIZATION NOT REVEALING ANY GLARING ERRORS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO              
SUCH DIFFERENCES...EXCEPT THAT THE NAM IS A LITTLE TOO WEAK WITH THE            
JET STREAK ACROSS MICHIGAN THIS MORNING.                                        
ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT TO FIND A REASON TO LEAN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER...             
STILL HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THE GFS IN REGARD TO THE DEGREE OF             
AMPLIFICATION OF THE MID LEVEL TROUGH ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST ON               
MONDAY...AND ASSOCIATED SFC LOW DRIVING UP THROUGH THE STATE INTO               
STRONG DRY CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE. REGIONAL RADAR PLOT/SATELLITE                
DATA DOES REVEAL POTENT WAVE NOW IN WESTERN IOWA AND A SUBSTANTIAL              
PRECIP SHIELD FROM NE IOWA INTO SW WISCONSIN. BUT NORTHWARD                     
PROGRESSION HAS THUS FAR BEEN HAMPERED BY THE DRY AIR OVER THE NRN              
GREAT LAKES...ALTHOUGH SOME EASTWARD EXPANSION OF RADAR ECHOS NOW               
TAKING SHAPE TOWARD SOUTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN LATE THIS AFTERNOON                 
ACROSS THE TIGHT BAROCLINIC ZONE. BELIEVE THE NORTHWARD PROGRESSION             
WILL CONTINUE TO BE HAMPERED OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND HENCE WILL              
CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE DRIER NAM WHICH KEEPS MAJORITY OF PRECIP SOUTH            
OF THE AREA AND RESULTS IN CHANCE POPS FOR THE CWA THROUGH TUESDAY              
NIGHT. CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT TO STRETCH POPS INTO WEDNESDAY AS THIS              
SYSTEM WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE OUT. BUT WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY WILL NOT             
TOUCH THAT FORECAST PERIOD YET.                                                 
THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE TODAY HAS COME INTO             
A LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT REGARDING THE OVERALL PATTERN EVOLUTION.              
BETTER CONSENSUS NOTED IN DEVELOPING A RATHER DEEP UPPER LOW ACROSS             
THE WESTERN CONUS LATE IN THE WEEK AND HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND...              
WHILE DOWNSTREAM RIDGING TAKES SHAPE OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN               
U.S. GFS REMAINS THE STRONGEST WITH THIS IDEA COMPARED TO THE ECMWF             
EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT              
WEATHER THROUGH THE PERIOD. ECMWF SOLUTION REMAINS A LITTLE LESS                
AMPLIFIED AND ALLOWS SOME SEMBLANCE OF A WEAK COLD FRONT TO SAG INTO            
THE NRN GREAT LAKES IN THE SAT-SUN TIMEFRAME. ECMWF SCENARIO BETTER             
SUPPORTED BY NCEP ENSEMBLE MEANS AS WELL AS HPC FORECAST GRAPHICS               
AND JUSTIFIES KEEPING THE LOW CHANCE FOR PRECIP DURING NEXT WEEKEND.            
OTHERWISE...AFTER A COOLER START TO THE WEEK TEMPERATURES EXPECTED              
TO REBOUND BACK TO OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMALS FOR MID SEPTEMBER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...                                         
BASED ON RECENT SURFACE AND SATELLITE DATA IN CONJUNCTION WITH                  
RECENT RUC, NAM, AND GFS MODEL SOLUTIONS, EXPECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF             
ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE UPPER               
OHIO VALLEY TO DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET. ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART, IT              
COULD STAY MAINLY CLOUDY TONIGHT DUE TO PERSISTENT STRATOCUMULUS.               
INSERTED MENTION OF PATCHY FOG MONDAY MORNING, BASED AS MUCH ON                 
PERSISTENCE AND CLIMATOLOGY AS MODEL GUIDANCE. STRATOCUMULUS ACROSS             
THE NORTH WILL HELP WITH FOG DEVELOPMENT IF IT DISSIPATES EARLY                 
TONIGHT, BUT PRECLUDE MUCH FOG DEVELOPMENT IF IT PERSISTS ALL NIGHT.            
REGARDING PRECIPITATION ONSET WITH APPROACHING MIDWEST LOW PRESSURE             
SYSTEM, LATEST GFS AND MORE SO LATEST NAM ARE SLOWER, SO HAVE ONLY              
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AFTERNOON, THEN               
CHANCE STARTING EARLY MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...                                     
SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT WILL MOVE SLOWLY                     
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. ASSOCIATED              
COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY REGION                
LATE WEDNESDAY. SO KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN                
FORECAST MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...THEN BUMPED UP TO LIKELY TUESDAY            
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. STILL A CHANCE OF SHOWERS EARLY THURSDAY AS

HIGH PRESSURE AT SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BUILD INTO REGION LATE                  
THURSDAY AND HOLD ON THROUGH THE WEEKEND BRINGING DRY CONDITIONS AND            
NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

LEAST INTO EARLY TONIGHT, AND POSSIBLY INTO MONDAY MORNING. FARTHER
