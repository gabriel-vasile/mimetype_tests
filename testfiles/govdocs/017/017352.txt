Agricultural Summary

For the week ending May 6, 2001, there were 6.8 days available for field
work across New England.  Topsoil moisture was rated 21% very short, 38% 
short, 38% adequate, 3% surplus.  Subsoil moisture was rated 16% very short,
16% short, 66% adequate, 2% surplus.  Pasture condition was rated as 11% 
very poor, 12% poor, 51% fair, 25% good, 1% excellent.  Major farm 
activities included:  planting field corn, sweet corn, and potatoes; 
spreading manure, prepping seed beds for planting, applying fertilizer, 
plowing, fixing fences, and setting up irrigation systems. 

FIELD CROPS: Record-breaking temperatures in some areas have dried up wet 
fields and crops are being planted at a fast pace.  Drought is a concern in
some areas and farmers are irrigating where necessary to keep down dust. 
Warm weather has permitted operators to plant field corn and potatoes, 
spread manure, apply fertilizer and fix fences.  Planting of potatoes in 
Rhode Island was above last year but behind the 5-year average.  Potato
planting in Massachusetts was behind both last year and the 5-year average. 
Alfalfa is looking good after a well-protected winter.  Some animals have
been put onto pastures.    

VEGETABLES: Planting of broccoli, sweet corn, peas, lettuce and cabbage has
begun.  Plastic sweet corn has germinated.  Tomatoes are being transplanted
into high tunnels.  High temperatures have affected early planting and 
harvest schedules.  

FRUIT: Apples were in the bud to early bloom stage.  Orchards are putting
their first sprays on trees.  Strawberries are starting to grow and 
irrigating has started on established beds.  Fungicide application for 
mummy berry disease in blueberries has begun in some areas of the region.
Cranberry vines look good; early varieties are green and later varieties 
starting to take on color.  Pollination going well due to the abundant 
number of bees for this time of the year.

CONNECTICUT - Howard Rood (FSA),
Fairfield/Litchfield: Fields are drying out after a cool,
late, spring. Planting of field corn is about two weeks
behind last year. Ross Eddy (FSA), Hartford/Tolland: Sweet corn and field
corn planting has begun. Orchards are putting first sprays on trees.
Hay and pasture development is delayed due to lack of rain. Tobacco 
seedlings in beds and green houses are looking very good. Bedding plants 
and flowers moving at farm stands. Richard Meinert (Ext), Litchfield: Crops are 
going in the ground at record pace. Grass is growing rapidly. No major 
problems reported by anyone. Karen Lockman ( FSA), New
Haven: Unusual weather conditions resulted in a heat
wave, with temperatures in the 90s for more than 3
consecutive days. Lack of rain has caused some
problems and farmers are irrigating very dry soils.
Early planted sweet corn and silage corn have
emerged. Bedding plants are flowering and are ready
to go. Joyce Meader (Ext), Windham: First year
alfalfa looking good after a well protected winter.
Plowed corn fields creating lots of dust for the
neighborhoods, with no rain expected until Thursday.
Dust seems to be the topic of the suburbanites, more
than the manure odor.  Dawn Pindell (FSA),
Windham: Dry, Dry, Dry....third driest April in 100
years according to Connecticut News Station, farmers
are spreading manure and harrowing with a lot of
powder, temperatures in the 80's and 90's have
brought on full blossoms in peaches with other fruits
right behind. Bees have to get to work to pollinate
while the flowers are on the trees, only for a short
while if the heat continues.

MAINE - Marvin Hedstrom, Northern Aroostook:
Practically no field work as yet. Minimal tillage last
couple of days. Next week field planting should begin.
Erin Chadborne (Ext), Aroostook: Currently,
potatoes, oats, barley, and broccoli are being planted.
Donna Lamb (Ext), Piscataquis: Dry weather has
allowed farmers to start tilling the fields that have
good drainage. Some farmers have started turning
out a few animals on pasture, but most pastures are
just starting to green up. Rick Kersbergen (Ext),
Waldo: Dry Conditions have allowed a lot of early
field work. Lots of manure being spread. Some corn
already planted. We need some significant rain.
Trudy Soucy (FSA), Knox/Lincoln: Planting has
begun. Some early corn has emerged. Burning
continues on blueberry fields; unusually late due to
the weather we had. We went from heavy snow cover
to extremely dry conditions in record time! Fire
danger is high! David Yarborough (UM),
Washington: Fields being pruned by burning and
mowing. Pre-emergence herbicide application being
made to non-bearing fields. Fungicide applications
being made for mummyberry disease. Strawberry
root worm adults and early instar span worm larvae
found in sweeps. Fields extremely dry. Development
normal. Michael Tardy (FSA), Androscoggin: The
warm, dry weather has allowed many farmers to start
spreading manure and preparing the land for
planting. Some of the early crops are in the ground. It
is very dry and we are in need of some moisture for
all crops. Gary Raymond (FSA), Franklin: Field
preparation has started with manure spreading.
Strawberries are being irrigated. Maple sap
production is down 50% or more. Despite record
setting heat, there is still snow left in the woods and
on roadsides in some areas. Laura Rand (FSA),
Oxford: Its been a long snowy winter! Oxford county
has just started to receive weather to permit ground
preparation. Seed beds are being tilled and prepped
for planting. A few cold crops have been planted.
Snow melt was slow and no rain in sight. 

MASSACHUSETTS - Arthur Williams (FSA),
Berkshire: Planting corn, applying fertilizer. Overly
dry. William Graham (FSA), Worcester: Plowing corn
and vegetable areas and spreading manure on fields.
So far, crops are looking normal for this time of year.
Not too wet. Soil moisture high. Fields are workable.
Still a bit early in the season. Frank Caruso (Ext),
Plymouth: Very low temperatures Sunday night into
Monday morning. Running the sprinklers on a frost
night is one way to irrigate, something growers have
needed to do since it has not rained appreciably here
since April 18. Quite a contrast from the
record-breaking rainfall we had in March. Cranberry
vines look good for the most part. Things advanced
significantly last week with Wednesday through
Friday in the low 90's. Early varieties are all greened
up and later varieties are taking on color slowly but
surely. I have never seen so many bumblebees at
this time of the year; boding well for subsequent
pollination. Of course, at this point the industry is
waiting for word on whether there will be a marketing
order to reduce the crop or not. Many more beds than
usual are being held under a late water flood at the
present time. This may be to compress the bloom into
a shorter period in order to destroy the bloom with a
June flood. John Devine (FSA), Franklin: Record
breaking high and low temperatures have affected
early planting and harvest schedules. It's been a
difficult week for any crops grown under plastic row
covers. Frosty weather at the beginning of the week
was followed by 90 degree heat. Asparagus is still in
short supply. Farm tillage and manure spreading are
ahead of schedule. Ted Smiarowski Jr (FSA),
Hampshire: Preparing land for spring seeded crops,
spreading manure, top-dressing hay fields, subsoiling
and fixing fences. Planting corn, potatoes, peas,
lettuce and cabbage. Harvesting fiddleheads and
asparagus. It is dry and farmers are irrigating their
early crops. Fruit trees are in bloom. Strawberry
growers have lain remay over strawberry beds for
earlier production. Nursery growers are very busy
harvesting their stock for spring sales. Greenhouse
growers have had a good growing season and sales
are very good. Most of the week was very dry, warm
and sunny.
 
NEW HAMPSHIRE - Bruce Clement (Ext),
Cheshire: Hot, dry weather for much of April and
early May has helped to dry out fields but is raising
concerns about drought. Crops have wintered well
with the exception of rhododendrons. Manure and
fertilizer spreading, seedings, plowing and harrowing,
fence repair, fruit spraying and all other usual spring
activities going on. Need rain! Nada Haddad (Ext),
Rockingham: After a long winter, summer came.
Had rain on Friday. Spreading manure and fertilizer
ongoing. Preparing seed beds. Some seeding being
done. Early vegetables being planted. Pruning
blueberry bushes. Need rain. George Hamilton
(Ext), Hillsborough: Liming and fertilizing hayfields.
Spreading manure, plowing, disking, fertilizing and
planting corn. Making new pasture and hayfield
seedings. Vegetables: Transplanting tomatoes into
high tunnels. Early season vegetables (peas, lettuce,
greens) are being planted, along with sweet corn.
Plastic sweet corn germinated. Fruits: Bloom is one
week ahead. Apples were in full bloom in the Hollis
area on Sunday. Peaches are at full fall. Strawberries
starting to grow and irrigating established beds.
Planting fruit trees, raspberries, blueberries and
strawberries. Fertilizing orchards. Protective fungicide
sprays applied. Winter-kill seen on highbush
blueberries and some apple trees. Weather: From
snow-covered field, three to four weeks, ago to
extremely dry condition for beginning of the growing
season. Some growers have started to irrigate fruit
crops and early season vegetables that have been
planted.

RHODE ISLAND - Marilu Soileau (FSA), All
Counties: We have already experienced record
temperatures, up to 90 degrees in the past week. Top
soils are very dry from breezy days and lack of rain.
Market crops are being planted earlier than usual.
The fruit tree bloom is magnificent. Sunny, warm days
will hopefully bring us good pollination. Potato
planting was underway as of last week. No rain in the
extended weather forecast. It is much too dry for early
May!

VERMONT -  John St. Onge (FSA), Lamoille:
Recent weather has been great for fieldwork.
Everyone busy spreading manure and commercial
fertilizer, fixing fences, and getting ready to plant.
Larry Hamel (NRCS), Orleans: We need rain. Jeff
Carter (Ext), Addison: Land preparation for planting
corn, manure spreading, fertilizer spreading on hay
fields. Some corn planted, some new seedings of hay
crop. Warm dry weather for two weeks has dried out
soil nicely. Pasture growth slow, little winter injury.
Richard Noel (FSA), Franklin: Manure being spread
all over, seedings being done; 25% of corn in the
ground. Surface moisture is lacking, but subsurface
moisture is good . Alfalfa came through the winter
very well and grass is good, but needs a good rain
right now or farmers are looking at a half a crop!
Pastures are green, but are short. Grass starting to
brown were ledge is close! Dennis Kauppila (Ext),
Caledonia: Record temperatures (80's) melted the
rest of the snow, except in the woods. Gentle
warming before this week made for very minor
flooding this spring after the record winter snow. Even
after all of this melted snow, the ground is dry,
allowing for a furious start to spring's work- fixing
fences, spreading manure, seeding hay ground, and
harrowing ground for corn. Sherwin Williams
(Other), Rutland: Plowing under winter rye. Planting
early sweet corn. Fertilizing. Soil dry on surface, but
moist underneath need rain. George Cook (Ext),
Lamoille: Dry weather for spring activities: manure
spreading, top dressing with commercial fertilizer,
plowing, harrowing, etc. Need rain. Bill Snow (Ext),
Orange:  We finally lost most of the patches of snow
that were in shaded areas. The 80 degree
temperatures did a lot to get rid of it fast. Despite the
deep snow pack in April ground moisture is low
because of no rainfall in several weeks. Saw the first
grazing of cows this weekend. A lot of manure being
spread, a lot of new seeding were also put in last
week. Fencing may take longer then usual due to a
lot of tree damage during the winter. Sounds like
above normal temperatures and no rain for most of
the week ahead.
