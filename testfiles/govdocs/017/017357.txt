HALOB AND T m I R RELATION TO THE WEATHER.

[Dated Weather Bureau, San Francisco, Cal., July 15, 1914.1
When rays of light from the sun or the moon pass through a cloud sheet, various subjective phenomena are caused b the moisture particles which make up the cloud mass. $hen the sun is observed through haze or attenuated fo it appears as a disk with sharply defined ed es.
or intermediate level, the sun's disk, when visible, is irregularly defined, is sometimes too bright to be observod directly with the naked e e, and is frequently surrounded b concentric rings of li it called coronas.

The are roduced through diffraction and interference oP the Eght rays by the water spherules and ice crystals encoun- tered. Because of the brightness of the sun many solar coronas pass unobserved, as they usually may be seen only by reflected light. Incom lete coronal arcs are often seen in the thin margins of % roken clouds like strato- cumulus and alto-cumulus. Wit8h the highest clouc! sheet the cirro-stratus, refraction and reflection of the rays Ly the ice crystals produce rings in which the colors, when visible, are always arranged with the red on the inside. These are halos proper or greater halos, and may be defined as somewhat complicated arrangements of arm and circles of light surrounding the sun or the moon, accompanied by others tangent to or intersecting them, with spotg of special brightness called parhelia a a t the points of tangency and intersection. pzkf are most often observed about sunrise or sunset, fre- quently when the intersecting arcs are themselves in- visible, except at the points where the two causes com- bine to reflect a double portion of the sun's rays. I n the order of their frequency, halos average about 2 5 O , 46', or 90' in radius, but on rare occasions various other sizes
have been observed. In the following discussion halos proper are alone considered.

Based upon the obsbrvations made at Blue Hill Observatory during 1891)-97, the mean height of cirro-stratus clouds is 10,09!) meters during April to September, inclusive, and is 8,S93 meters during October to March, inclusive (1). The mean for the year is 9,496 meters, an average higher than that of any other form of cloud. The masimum height a t which they have been observed is 13,601 meters, while an instance of cirro- stratus cloud a t 4,036 meters is also on record. However, i t is sufficient to sap that they are high clouds, so high in

Doubtless practically all of the solar halos which have been visible there during that time have been recorded, but many lunar halos have robably been unnoticed, since no observer is on duty [etween midnight and 7 a. m. It is apparent from the table that solar halos are most frequent 111 the spring, the mean number for March bein 5.9, and are least common
mean of 2.3. Lunar halos are most frequent in winter, the mean for January being 2.7 and are least frequent in summer, the mean for June, August, and September being but 0.6.

Certain other facta must be considered in this connec- tion, however. In ths latitude of the observatory (lat. 42O 13’ N., long. 71° 7’ W. of Greenwich) the sun is above
the horizon about 6 hours lo er in June than it is in
when solar halos may occur. Cyclones are more frequent Deoember, thus increasing by 3 a out 67 per cent the time
and hznce cimstratus clouds are more common h w i n e than in summer. The relatively small number of solar halos in summer as compared mth the number in winter seems to indicate, whm t h s e facta are kept in mind, that the conditions favoring t h e i r formation are very much less frcquent thnn. On the other hand, sincs the nighta are longer in winter than in summer more lunar halos are theoretically possible during that half-year. More- over, lunar halos are also related to the age of the moon, since the lattcr niuvt usually be in a phase between first and Inst uarter in order to give sufficient light to produce
a halo. (bartly for this reason, the total number of solar halos in a year is more than twice that of lunar halos. As may be learned from the table, few months occur in which no solar halos am observed while sometimes as man. as 12 are seen, ts was the case in March 1908. Dunng the 20 yean the total number of solar hdos per ear ranged from 30 in 1899 to 62 in 1895 and 1909. Eunar halos are not observed every month, though as nian. as 7 were seen in one month, December, 1898. Dumg the period considered the number per ear varied from 9 in 1902 to 24 in 1907 and 1908. %do8 vary rtlatlg in the duration of their exktence, some lasting %ut a few minuta, while others continue for many h o w A solar halo was observed to ersist for 10 hours, while 0;
several occasions a lunar h s o observzd in the evening was still visible early the next morning, doubtless having continued all night. Based upon the records lor the 10 ears 1901 to 1910, inclusive, the average duntion of
galos in hours for each month of the year a t Blue Hill is as follows:
TABLE Z.-Avemqe duration (in h a ) of hala for d month.
In the opular mind considerable attention is vert to
to them occurring in poetry avd roverb. Various Euro- pean studies have been made in t%g connection, but with the exception of a paper by Mr. George Reeder (6), Section Director of the Umted States Weather Bureau a t Colum- bia, Mo., no extensive study based u on American data
observed at Columbia, Mo. during 1905 and 1906, Mr. Reeder concluded that (a) “halos are a ver good guide in redicting weather changes, especially &e 22-dee;ree circfes;” (b) the 22-degree circle is followed by precipita- tion usually within 12 to 18 hours, the storm center cross-
ing the meridian near the point of observation; and (c)
“when the 45-degree circle is observed the storm center is usually from 800 to 1,000 miles or more awax, cedes recipitation, if an , by 24 to 36 hours. He aa
sions when a West Indian hurricane waa immediately off or near the east Gulf or South Atlantic States. The relation of halos to recipitation as shown b the
years 1901 to 1910, inclusive, is summarized in%able 3.

The apparent close relationship exis between halos and recipitation can be easily explained 9 rom a study of clou ip distribution in cyclones. Long-continued observe tions have established the fact that when no low clouds are present a halo is fornird (a) whenever a thin stratum
the sun or the moon is visible, or (b) occasiona 3 y where with of cirrostratus cloud e-sists in that part of the s
high cirrus clouds in which the streamers are sdciently dense or are matted to produce the stratus effect, the
hdo in this case being broken or incomplete. The study of halos, therefore, resolves itself largely into a study of
cirrus and cirrostratus clouds. Because of their infre- quent occurrence, cirrostratus clouds in anticyclones are
not considered here. For the Sam9 reason cim-stratus clouds associated with thunderstorms are not referred to. Figure 1 shows the distribution of clouds in a cyclone central a t Blue Hill, based upon tha observations made

The departure from the normal shows how niuch niorr frequently preci itation follows cirro-stratus cloud than is indicated by &e average probability of rain regardlcss of cloud. Cirrostratus cloud movin from an castidy point is a rare phenomenon at Blue s i l l , only 8 out of
239 observations during that year showing such move'-
ment. While Figurs 1 may be regarded as a projrction upon the ground of the cloud areas in a cyclone, Figure. 2 may be considered as a longitudinal section alon a major a s s through the center of a typical storm, and%mcc parallr-1 to the diTcction of movement (7). In this diagram thrb
vertical dunension is not clir~ctly comparable with thv horizontal dimension, since the ty ical storm reprcwntd
in depth, 2,400 to 4,800 kilometers (1,500 to 3,000 milcs)
is, in round numbers, 10 to 13 ki Y ometers (6 to S milcs)
in length, and 1,600 to 2,400 kilometers (1 000 to 1,500
miles) in breadth. The storm .as shown in &e diagram is suppos~d to move from l--ft to r' ht. The sequence of
lows: Cirrus streamers accompanied by scattered cirro- cumulus clouds give the first warning of the approach of a storni, and often appcar before the barometer begins to fall. Soon the cirrus becomes denser and cirrostratus cloud is formed, a halo ap earing if the sun or the moon is favorably located. The%arometrr begins to fall about this time, the Wind goes around to a southerly point and the teni eraturc rises. The c P oud stratum becomes thicker and lower, and the halo disap ears when the clouds change to alto-stratus and alto-cumuks. The clouds become denser and darker, the wind veers to an easterly oint and increases in velocity,

The nest two proverbs refer to the size of the halo and state, in other words, that rain follows a 46O-hdo sooner than a 22O-halo. Since the halos recorded at Blue Hill are not classified aa to radius, the truth or falsity of these sayings can not be tested. However, it is interestin to note in this coniiectioii that Mr. George Reeder founf(6) that rains followed ZO-halos within 12 to 1s hours, and 46O-halos within 24 to 36 hours. This would indicate that, for 3risso11ri at least, the opposite of the idea ex- pressed in the two proverbs is true.

As k as the earth’s atmosphere is concerned, the physical explanations of the two kinds of halos are similar.

While these two proverbs at first appear to express a parados, both are probably true statements, and may be axplained as follows: h the cirrus and cirro-stratus fronds push across the sky in the re ion of the sun the halo h t appears and subsequently % ecomes brigheat in

that part of the arc from which the cyclone is ap roach- ing. Later the halo becomes complete and the fight is homogeneous throughout. As the storm advances, alto- stratus cloud arrives and obliterates the original aiid for a time the brighest part of the halo, that is, the side nearest the oncomin storm. Both proverbs are t.rue
tory of the halo.
(15) Double or treble circles round the moon foreshadows rough and .severe storm, and much more so if these circles are not pure and entire, but are spotted and broken.-(Bacon.)
When halos are double or treble it si iiifies that the cirro-stratus cloud is relatively thick, sucf as is likely to be the case in a deep and hence well-developed storm. Broken halos indicate a much disturbed state in the upper air, with precipitation near a t hand.
(16) If there be a ring or halo around the sun in bad weather, expect h e weather Boon.
(17) If the ridin sun be encompaeaed with an iris or circle of white clouds an% they equally fly away, this a sign of fair weather.-
(PhY.1 (18) I1 the eun or moon outshines the “brugh,” bad weather will not come.
These three proverbs may refer to the halo often observed at the rear of a c clone, and belong to the type referred to
tation. Or they may refer to a halo on either side of the path of the precipitation aren, this type of halo being neither preceded nor followed by precipitation.

In the present study the relatioil between halos and wind wtis not investigated. However, the four proverbs referring to wind seem to be applicable to the wind a t t,he rear of a cyclone which usually accompanies the clenring conditions following precipitation.
