Good morning. Welcome to this Subcommittee's second in a series of hearings
focused on issues related to teacher quality. Let me begin by noting that this
is Teacher Appreciation Week. I know that several of our witnesses are, or have
been teachers; and I am sure we have at least a few teachers in our audience. To
each of you, I thank you for your dedication to our Nation's children.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Yesterday, we passed a resolution
supporting and commending our teachers, and there were a lot of good things
said; and I am sure it was inadequate to really thank our teachers for what they
do.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Last week, we heard from a broad
spectrum of witnesses who all stated unequivocally that teacher quality is the
most important factor in student achievement. A question perhaps far more
difficult to answer is, how do we make sure that every teacher is of high
quality? Although there are many views on this question, today we will take a
close look at the role that professional development can play in making sure
that all teachers at least have the necessary knowledge to be highly effective.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We will begin by examining the role of
the Federal Government in providing funds for professional development.
Additionally, we will take a much closer look at the largest Federal program
dedicated to this area, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. In
focusing on this program, we will hopefully get a better understanding of its
strengths and weaknesses from both a national as well as a local perspective.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, the Eisenhower Program is
often only a piece of a broad array of professional development programs
administered by school districts. To learn more about how these, along with
State and local programs, are coordinated and the difficulties in doing so, we
have the opportunity to hear from an exemplary local school official.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Additionally, we will have the
opportunity to hear the tremendous benefit that an effective professional
development program can have upon both teachers and entire schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I wish to thank each of our witnesses
for taking time to be with us, and I look forward to their testimonies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At this time I yield to the Ranking
Member, Mr. Martinez, for any statement that he might have.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Martinez</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you said, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week.
And yesterday we passed a resolution recognizing the important achievements of
our Nation's teachers and urging all Americans to pay tribute to our Nation's
teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many Members came to the floor to share
fond memories and express deep gratitude for a teacher or teachers who made a
difference in their lives. My own perception of education was greatly impacted
when my 6th grade teacher, Mrs. Cason, took the time to show me that I could
learn once she got my attention.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, I think that all of us who
spoke yesterday realize that the very positive experiences we encountered in the
classroom took place in a different era. Although, as many highly qualified and
dedicated individuals enter the field of teaching today, they face different
problems than they did 40 years ago. Today their talents are spread so thinly
they cannot effectively address the needs of their students. Many become
discouraged and leave the field after only a few short years.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Therefore, I believe it is incumbent
upon us to provide incentives to these highly qualified and dedicated
individuals to not only entice them into the classroom in the first place, but
also to ensure that once they get there, they stay.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We must provide teachers with smaller
classes so they can manage their students better and spend quality time with
them. We must provide them with classrooms that are clean and safe. We must
provide them with a curriculum that is current and technology so they can
prepare our children for the 21st century.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Most of all, we must provide them with
opportunities to continue their own educations so they may effectively pass this
curriculum and those technological skills on to our children. In the words of
the famous librarian, John Cotton Dana, &quot;He who teaches must never cease to
learn.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As such, we must ensure that our
teachers have access to quality professional development that is intensive,
sufficient in duration, and connected to the classroom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This Subcommittee is currently in the
process of drafting legislation that will provide such access to our Nation's
teachers. We are seeking input from the community on this legislation, and we
are very interested to hear your thoughts on professional development.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I look forward to your testimony, and I
yield back the balance of my time.</font></p>

time to break, if we have to. We will run and vote and come right back and then

My extoicomometry, which I never heard of the word in my life, professor and
chemistry professor as a freshman in college, which was Dr. Harry Bauman, had a
son, David Bauman, and I had to go down and find out if Dr. Bauman was he. Of
course, I was a country boy, and Dr. Bauman indicated about halfway through the
first semester that if I really didn't get down to work, I didn't have a
snowball's chance in Hades of passing through the course. So he was generous,
however, by the time we got to the end of the semester.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Shaul</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. We appreciate the
opportunity to discuss our ongoing work for the Subcommittee concerning
federally funded teacher training programs. Two factors make today's hearing
timely: one is the increased national attention on teacher quality and the other
is the evolving implementation of the Results Act, which requires that agencies
rethink how they manage programs and demonstrate professional development.
Because teacher training plays a key role in education reform efforts, it is
important to know the current level and range of Federal investment in these
programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Today, I would first like to describe
the number of agencies and the programs they administer that support teacher
training, along with some general characteristics of the programs. Then I will
discuss the funding provided for these programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I will also discuss some of the
challenges in determining whether these programs are achieving desired outcomes.
My statement is based on preliminary observations from our ongoing review. In
summary, our preliminary results indicate that 13 agencies administer 87
programs which support teacher training to varying degrees. The Department of
Education administers the majority of these programs. Federal funding for
teacher training is estimated at about $1.5 billion during fiscal year 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The number of agencies and the number
and diverse nature of the programs create challenges in determining whether
programs are achieving national goals. I would like to elaborate briefly on each
of these topics.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First, the extent to which the 87
programs support teacher training varies. While some programs were created
specifically to support teacher training, many other support teacher training as
a means of achieving other purposes. As part of our review, we asked agencies to
classify their programs into three categories based on these differences.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Agencies responded as follows: 12
programs are designed only or exclusively to support teacher training. Education
administers eight of these programs, including the Eisenhower State Grant
Program, the largest teacher training program. Thirty-nine programs are designed
to achieve purposes other than just teacher training but support a significant
amount of teacher training.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These programs include, for example,
education's title I program. Teacher training is only one of many ways title I
funds can be used to help educate disadvantaged children. Thirty-six programs
allow teacher training as an activity but do not provide a significant amount of
teacher training.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Across all three categories, the
majority of programs are designed to support training for teachers who already
teach, rather than those preparing to become teachers. They do so by providing
funds to pay for a variety of training-related expenses. The most frequently
reported eligible use of funds was for materials, such as books on teaching
strategies, travel, direct instruction, graduate credit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Agency officials estimate that about
$1.5 billion will be used to support teacher training in fiscal year 1999.
Education's programs account for about 87 percent of total funding. More than
$579 million will be provided by the 12 programs that agencies classified as
focused exclusively on supporting teacher training. This is about 38 percent.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">About 945 million will be provided by
the 39 programs that agencies classified as supporting teacher training to a
significant degree. This accounts for 62 percent of total funding. Because State
and local officials have flexibility under these programs, the amount of funds
spent on teacher training may vary from year to year.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Funding estimates are generally
unavailable for programs where teacher training is an allowable, but not a
significant, activity. As we have shown, the Federal Government will make a
significant investment in a variety of programs that support teacher training,
about $1.5 billion. An investment of this magnitude makes knowing whether
programs are achieving desired results important.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As part of our ongoing review, we plan
to assess whether identified Federal programs are effectively configured to
achieve national goals. One of the ways we will do this is by reviewing
agencies' efforts under the Results Act.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This concludes my prepared statement. I
would be happy to answer any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee might
have. And did I miss the trapdoor?</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Birman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary
findings from the national evaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program. And I am accompanied by Dr. Garet, the deputy director of the
evaluation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Professional development of teachers is
a crucial element of the Nation's efforts to improve education. And as Dr. Shaul
mentioned, the Eisenhower Program is the largest of the Department's efforts to
develop teachers' competence. I will be talking about two aspects of the program
today: one component which funds States and districts based on a formula, and
then the 16 percent of the program that goes to the institutions of higher
education and nonprofit organizations through a competitive State grant program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 1994 reauthorization of the
Eisenhower Program really laid out four strategies that I will be discussing
today. First, the program is aimed at supporting high-quality professional
development activities; second, the program is aimed at including and targeting
teachers of at-risk students; third, the reauthorization in 1994 intended the
program to be integrated with other ongoing reform and professional development
efforts; and, fourth and finally, the reauthorization intended that the program
track progress by means of performance indicators.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have details here in the testimony,
which I won't go into it about the evaluation itself. But just in a word, we
have conducted national samples of teachers who participated in the Eisenhower
Program, coordinators of the program at the district level, project directors
from the institutions of higher education. We have conducted case studies in 16
districts around the country. And we are currently in the middle. We are not
finished with the evaluation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We are conducting a longitudinal study
of about 500 teachers at three points in time to get a more firm fix on the
impact of the program on teacher practice. So those results I won't be talking
about today, but I will be talking about the results from all of our national
surveys and case studies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first area I wanted to address has
to do with the contribution of the program to teaching practice. And I am
focusing on the knowledge and skills of teachers, the knowledge and skills that
teachers bring to the classroom. Preliminary analyses of our survey data
indicates that there is a lot of variability in the reports of knowledge and
skills that teachers gain from the Eisenhower Program. Some teachers report
substantial enhancement of their knowledge and skills. Other teachers report
much less.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On average, the higher education and
nonprofit organization part of the program appears to be producing better
results than the district-sponsored part of the program. One of the important
aspects of our evaluation is to identify what are the features that account for
this. And we identify six features.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One very important feature is the
content focus of the professional development. I believe you mentioned this in
your earlier remarks. The content focus in literature is showing that that would
have an effect on student achievement. Also professional development in
particular content and how children learn that content appears to have a very
important effect on teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second is opportunities for active
learning, features such as being observed, sharing knowledge, evaluating student
work; third, connection of the professional development to teachers other
experiences; fourth, the amount of time, number of hours, and the time span of
the professional development is an important feature; fifth, participating in
professional development with other teachers from the same school, grade level,
or subject area appears to be important; and finally, what we consider reform
types of professional developments, study groups, networks and so forth, appear
to be important because they have some of these other features as well. They go
on for a long period of time as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What we found is that the IHE portion
of the program, the Institution of Higher Education portion of the program,
appeared to be better on many of these characteristics. And that explains why
teachers appear to have better results from the professional development
provided by the IHE portion of the program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Is the trapdoor opening? I just have a
few more remarks. A couple of other areas I just need to cover. I mentioned the
importance of targeting of the program to teachers in high-poverty schools. We
find that preliminary data shows that the program is not particularly doing a
particularly good job in this area.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The proportion of teachers from
high-poverty schools doesn't appear to be very different from the proportion in
the Nation as a whole. And we attribute this from some of our case data to the
fact that the Eisenhower Program, as most professional development, really
focuses on recruiting volunteers for professional development. So that is at
least one explanation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With regard to fitting in with other
professional development programs and activities, we find that the Eisenhower
Program directors report that they align their activities with State and local
standards and also participate in a lot of coordination, especially with
activities funded by the National Science Foundation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And this is in part or largely due to
the fact that the Eisenhower Program, as you know, is a mathematics- and
science-focused program. Most of the funding goes to professional development in
mathematics and science; and, therefore, it is a logical connection to make with
the NSF-funded programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We find also that there is a lot of
cofunding of professional development activities with NSF programs. And this, in
fact, helps districts to fund the types of professional development that appear
to have the most effect on teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I will skip my remarks about program
indicators, but I will be glad to discuss them later with regard to the
evaluation, how districts evaluate their activities. I just wanted to say about
three things on implications for the program from our study from our preliminary
findings.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First, we feel from our findings that
the program should seek ways to encourage the use of all of the features of
professional development that we have listed as related to the teachers'
knowledge and skills, with a particular emphasis on the content focus of the
professional development.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second, the program should place
greater emphasis on targeting for teachers of high-poverty schools. If this is a
priority for the Congress, then we feel that that doesn't seem to be happening,
and it would be a good focus.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Third, the program should continue to
emphasize alignment with standards and assessments and cofunding professional
development with activities funded by other programs. This appears to give the
districts the ability to pool resources and provide the kinds of long-term,
in-depth professional development that teachers seem to benefit from.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And, finally, the Eisenhower Program
has provided continuous support for professional development activities within
the areas of mathematics and science. As I have said, the evaluation highlights
the importance of a content focus and the Eisenhower Program has in many
districts built capacity in those areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So if the Congress is considering
expanding the program, it should consider creating analogous programs within
content areas, rather than eliminating the content focus on math and science
entirely. I would be glad to answer questions. I am sorry. I am glad you don't
have a trapdoor actually.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Bauman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
First, I would like to thank Representative Goodling for inviting me here. It is
an honor and privilege to come before you and talk about professional
development. I would also like to thank Congress for their continued and ongoing
support of the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The Math/Science
Alliance and Institute are projects of the Council of Public Education in
Harrisburg, which is a nonprofit community-based program which receives its
funding from private sources. However, we utilize professional development funds
to leverage additional funds in our work.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For every dollar of Eisenhower funds
that we use, we are able to leverage at minimum 10 additional dollars. We do not
use any of the funds for administrative or operating expenses. Without the
Eisenhower funds, our districts would not be able to send teachers to the
institute and participate in professional development sessions. The changes in
classrooms would not be occurring.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The alliance and institute are
attempting an unprecedented approach in the Harrisburg region by addressing the
entire educational system. Systemic reform is based on the assumption that all
components complement and build on the strengths of each other; therefore, we
don't focus on any one component, but are attempting to influence all components
and build upon their interconnectedness. The key agent in math and science
reform is the teacher.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effective teaching is the heart of our
efforts. Teachers who participate in the institute commit to complete over 125
hours of professional development over a 3-year period. We design the sessions
to meet the needs of the classroom teachers as they implement a standards-based
curriculum. It is imperative for these teachers to learn new content and how it
applies in a real-world setting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Are there significant changes due to
this? Yes. Students of participating teachers are more motivated to learn math
and are more self-confident. They are more involved in problem solving. They
understand math concepts better. They are using manipulative layers and concrete
experiences. Teachers are more aware of NCTM and State standards. The math is
more focused.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Teachers are more confident. They have
more opportunities to learn math and science content. Students are more involved
in hands-on inquiry-based science. They understand science concepts better. And
I can go on from what our data has shown.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Pleiades Project is another project
where seven districts have committed to work together to align and develop K12
science curricula with the standards, national and State. They are collaborating
on in-service days, utilizing interdistrict communication via Internet,
professional development for the proposed adopted curriculum.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Two of the superintendents have told me
without these funds they would not be able to participate. Once again,
professional development is the key to the success of this project. And
Eisenhower funds have leveraged the additional dollars to make it possible.
Given that materials appropriate for inquiry-based science teaching are central
to achieving the educational goal set forth in the standards, it is critical
that an effective infrastructure for material support be part of any science
program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our materials resource center has over
$500,000 worth of materials and equipment utilized in classrooms across the
region. All were purchased utilizing private donations and foundations. Private
industry has donated funds towards specific items and projects, but want to see
their funds leverage additional dollars. Again, the Eisenhower funds through our
professional development program make these donations possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Providers Network is an effort by
the alliance to bring together and coordinate different initiatives in the
Capital Area. A provider is an organization whose efforts impact math and
science education for K through 12 students and is funded through grants or
donations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This network meets regularly to
collaborate with others to learn from the experience of others, identify needs
within the region, strengthen programs and ideas and discuss possible future
initiatives, and ultimately avoid duplication of efforts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As a part of that, we are facilitating
the building of local capacity. We focus the training session on alignment of
materials and projects to standards. The Providers Network align their outreach
to both national and State standards, as well as the curriculum of the
individual districts. Therefore, even though these workshops are often short
term or one-day events they are very focused on the curriculum and setting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These providers are aligning their
services with all efforts in the region to promote math and science reform.
Eisenhower funds, again, enable each of these outreach programs to leverage
additional dollars. Short-term professional development can be effective, if it
is focused on identified needs and programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We are seeing the results. Our funders
expect schools to match and contribute towards professional development
programs. The Eisenhower funds are the means by which we are able to show a
match; and more importantly, they provide the means to districts to release
teachers to participate in our program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The amount of money Eisenhower
leverages is significantly more than the total amount of money we receive
through Eisenhower. While our efforts have been visionary, a common thread
throughout all of this, as you can tell, is the Eisenhower Professional
Development Program. Thank you.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I appreciate the opportunity to share our work on a systems approach to
professional development and resource alignment. We have engaged in a
partnership with New American Schools and Policy Studies Associates,
Incorporated, to develop a strong professional development system to ensure the
best and lifelong learning for our teachers and the highest quality
instructional programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have learned three key lessons from
our work: first, a comprehensive professional development system consists of
four separate, but very interrelated domains, the individual career paths from
new teacher induction to retirement; second, formal and informal professional
development learnings, focused on student outcomes, including what we
traditionally think of as professional development trainings and workshops, but
also study groups, peer collaboration, and experimentation and reflection.
Third, professional development policies in a district including teacher
selection, rewards, incentives, governance and performance appraisals are
important; and, fourth, the links to the key district priorities and operations,
including the school improvement planning process and resource allocation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">School districts must develop programs
and policies in all four of these domains to provide a quality professional
development system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our second lesson. At the school and
the district level, comprehensive planning guided by careful review of student
outcomes and achievement needs with resources aligned to these outcomes is
essential.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And third, a standards-driven continuum
with flexibility in funding sources and requirements and accountability for
student learning is needed to make sustained growth in teacher learning and is
paramount to a successful instructional program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our journey into Dorchester County has
been greatly identified by a professional development tool that new American
Schools and Dr. Hasham at Policy Studies Associates have created. During the
past year, our superintendent established a professional development council
comprised of teachers, principals, parents, and central office administrators.
Thus far the council's work has included collecting and reviewing data on our
current programs and budgets in professional development, the writing of a
professional development standards document for our district, which is being
presented for adoption by our school board; and, third, we have begun work on a
comprehensive evaluation system on our PD program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In addition, we are currently
concentrating on developing a school improvement plan resource guide for our
teachers and principals, to use in allotting their student needs assessment,
their instructional improvement initiatives, their school professional
development plans, and their school budgets. The connections between a school
improvement plan, the professional development plan, and budget are critical to
help focus on improving student achievement.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At the same time, our district has been
engaged in this professional development infrastructure work. The State of
Maryland has initiated a new planning and budgeting process that we call
comprehensive planning. This process has become pivotal in our district; indeed,
we live and die by the red book in Cambridge. It allows us to proactively engage
in using the Ed Flex options for coordinating program design and delivery across
several Federal and State funding streams.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During the last fiscal year, Dorchester
County initiated nine instructional improvement programs with funds from 16
different sources. These initiatives reflected funding support from Title I;
Title II, Eisenhower; Title IV, SAFE and drug-free schools; Title VI, innovative
programs; Goals 2000; Obey-Porter/Comprehensive School Reform; State
compensatory education; targeted poverty grants; State monies for targeted
improvement grants; limited English proficiency grants; early childhood
education; a professional development project; child abuse, suicide and teen
pregnancy-prevention monies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When I arrived in the district 18
months ago, I found a report of 137 grants in a tangle of funding streams and
programs which were very cumbersome and confusing. They all had different fiscal
years and program formats.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By simplifying the planning process and
allowing flexibility in the variety of grant sources, we have been able to focus
on our students' and our teachers' needs and implement programs to address the
kids' achievement needs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have in Maryland the School
Performance Accountability Program, and that provides us with the standards and
tools to measure student improvement. With that already in place, we found the
flexibility of coordinating the funding sources, along with these clear
accountability standards, to be especially helpful in our efforts to improve
professional development for teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We believe that development of an
integrated professional development system and a coordinated approach to
allocating resources across multiple funding streams has enabled our district to
focus on our school improvement needs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We sincerely appreciate the work of the
Members of the House of Representatives in making professional development for
educators, teachers, and administrators a substantive issue at the national
policy level. Professional development is truly the cornerstone of school
improvement. Thank you.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Moats</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Good morning. It is a privilege to speak to you today, not only as a researcher,
but as a former teacher and a current teacher of teachers. From any vantage
point, the need to improve teacher quality is obvious and urgent. The question
is how best shall this be done.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My comments today focus primarily on
lessons learned from our professional development program in nine intervention
and three comparison schools in the District of Columbia. Seven of the
intervention schools targeted as assistance schools all have a high level of
children in poverty.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our goal is to enable teachers in the
early grades to teach children to read. Success for us is measured by two
criteria: one, teachers demonstrate the knowledge base and skills to accomplish
the job at hand; and, two, the children in their classes achieve at grade level
or better.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During the first year of our project,
the 29 first grade classes as a whole raised their scores 25 percentile points
on average to above the 51st percentile. We hope the results will be even better
this year. The NICHD-funded research we conduct includes a strong emphasis on
teacher course work, observation, consultation, and collaboration. To this end,
our motto is, &quot;Know your stuff, know who you are stuffing, and stuff
children systematically at every moment possible.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The following principles appear to be
those most influential in the successes we have achieved: Number one,
professional development must be informed by a clear delineation of the content
knowledge and procedural knowledge that expert teachers need. Effective teachers
must know the essential components of instruction, why they are important, how
these components are related to one another, and how to teach each one well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We justify the practices we advocate
with reference to research that represents the consensus findings of the field.
It is essential to begin with a coherent advisory, as have the States of
California, Illinois, Texas, and Virginia, and I am sure others, that defines
the major findings of reading research and what they mean in practice.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With a clear definition of
research-based practice, policymakers can adopt standards for teachers,
students, and teacher-trainers and then proceed with the enterprise of
instructional improvement. Without a core curriculum for teacher preparation,
fads will come and go; and schools will continue to buy &quot;edutainment&quot;
packages from workshop vendors that have minimal impact on teacher behavior.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our teachers in D.C. like the fact that
our courses teach a comprehensive framework for action within which the
individual lessons and activities will fit. They expect, given the comprehensive
agenda we have constructed, to work toward mastery in increments over the year
and more.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second, the content of the courses must
be aligned with student performance standards, classroom curriculum and programs
and student assessment. Our success with teachers varies in D.C. sometimes we
are frustrated when there is no immediate carryover between what we teach the
teachers and what they do in their classes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have learned that there must be
direct continuity between what we teach them in class, and what their
instructional materials ask them to do with their children. For example, we
taught teachers about phonemic awareness during the first year of the study, but
it was not until we gave teachers a supplementary program manual, a test that
measured the skills taught and practiced carrying out specific activities, that
the teachers were likely to apply what we had taught them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If the teachers' job is to implement
best, then best practice must be consistently defined, as it is in the
California reading initiative, and must be consistently represented in
instructional materials, curriculum standards, assessments, and teacher
preparation courses. It is the confusion and discontinuity of past practice that
has been very discouraging for teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Third, there must be constant interplay
between actual practice with children, and formal classroom study of psychology,
pedagogy and content area knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fourth, teachers need incentives,
recognition, and rewards for doing well. Some of the incentives we have used are
small stipends for afterhours course work, thanks to Congress, credits for
participating in training, positive comments from the observers, visits to
classes, citation of highly-successful teachers within our program group, the
use of those teachers to mentor their peers, donations of free books and
instructional materials for completion of tasks and positive verbal acknowledge
for the efforts teachers are making.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In summary, quality professional
development shall be one aspect of a system-wide program of change, class size
reduction should be one dimension of systemic reform. Quality teacher
preparation and professional development should be another. Training will most
likely improve teaching and raise achievement if it is long term, comprehensive,
continuous, aligned with research, aligned with standards and assessments, and
if it teaches teachers to do specific things for which they have a purpose.
Thank you.</font></p>

Thank you. This has been very enlightening. We had a hearing last week, and we

If I could put a qualifier on that. Yes, with inquiry-based science and
problem-solving mathematics, then the classroom becomes critical as far as how
the children learn. I don't see the teacher necessarily being the conduit of
knowledge, but being able to create a classroom environment where inquiry or
problem solving can occur, so long as that doesn't mean that the teacher is the
one that puts the knowledge in the kid's head that creates the environment for
the learning to occur.</font></p>

You can lead a horse to water; you can't make him drink. But the right kind of
teacher can make them want to drink, and the wrong kind of teacher can make them
not want to drink. So we would agree on that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And then the question is, how do you
get all teachers to that achieve at that level? And that is like saying how do
you get all policemen to be the best policemen, or how do you get all physicians

To answer the in-service question, about 78 percent of the funds were devoted to
in-service primarily. The agencies reported that about 6 percent of the funds
were devoted primarily to preparing teachers, and then there was a mix. The
remainder of the programs said there was sort of an equal amount between the
preservice and in-service. I think that was about 16 percent of the funds. So
the majority is for in-service.</font></p>

We look for alignment of their training program with the Maryland State
accountability standards. Have they received training on both consent and
pedagogy? Do they know what to teach and how to teach it? But, frankly, that is
the second thing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first thing we look for is someone

No, no; but there is certainly a gap between university training programs and
current practice in the field in terms of the student outcomes and expectations,
and accountability standards. It is particularly difficult in Maryland, where
Maryland only trains about half of the teachers that she hires, which means we
go to other States and other parts of the country to get them and they are
obviously not being trained on Maryland accountability standards and content

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Martinez</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to expand on the last question that the
Chairman asked, and that you responded to, because it is the second time this
issue has come up -- the first time from somebody on the other side of the
country, California -- that the field experiences that are provided to teacher
candidates in colleges and institutions of higher education are not like
situations that they would actually encounter in the classroom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As a result, many teachers come to the
classroom ill-prepared for what they encounter there, especially like in rural
areas. And so, they get discouraged because they weren’t expecting to
encounter those kinds of situations, and they weren’t taught how to deal with
them. They then either leave the teaching profession altogether, or they try to
find a school district where they won’t encounter those kinds of situations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And sadly, I don’t think there is any
place you go today, even in the rural or suburban areas, where you will not
encounter difficulties in the classroom. I believe we should prepare our
teachers better.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, you say that you have overcome
this problem by providing in-house training when they come to you from these
colleges. How does that work?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I am not sure I would say we overcome that. I would say that is a major priority
for us, that the transition period in the first two years for a teacher, from
their college preparation program until they become a tenured teacher with us,
is one of very intense training. We do summer programs and extended day programs
for them. It is a critical transition for them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The internship, the student teaching
experience, most of our beginning teachers tell us isn't long enough for them,
and they don't really have their own classroom. They come in; they work with a
cooperating teacher, but things like parent conferencing and classroom
management strategies, in addition to the content and pedagogy, are areas that
they really need time on their own to learn those skills. It is not something
that is learned in a classroom in isolation of the students.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Martinez</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I have a question for the entire panel, while I don’t expect an answer right
now, I would like you to think about it. How can we, at the federal level,
provide incentives for districts to provide quality teacher training? You might
be able to help us with that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Shaul, I was looking at appendix 2
of your report, the index of 40 programs that you categorize as receiving or
providing significant teacher training. And I am wondering how you came up with
this list -- when in some instances it says training obligations are unknown, or
percentage of funds not available. So, how could you know what they were
providing?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then in one case you list a program as
providing significant teacher training -- I am referring to the fund for the
improvement of postsecondary education -- when only four percent of the funds
are used for teacher training. How does that qualify as significant? I can see
where Goals 2000 or local education systemic improvement grants, which dedicate
36 percent of their funds to teacher training, how I would consider that
significant. But how do you compare 4 percent to 36 percent as significant?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, there is one program here
that you have listed as being one of the 40 programs that receives no funds for
teacher training. The Ellender Fellowship receives no funds for teacher
training, and it doesn’t appear to have any training obligations. How can you
list this as significant teacher training?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are certanly some on this list
that I agree with. For instance, the International Education Exchange at 60
percent and the Aerospace Education Program at 50 percent. But even with the
aerospace program -- it is hard for me to imagine how you lump it in with
education programs, because it is specially dedicated to aerospace and it is
part of that program exclusively.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But you do have some that I would
consider very significant, like the Educational Exchange Teachers from secondary
and postsecondary levels and the Fulbright program which provides 100 percent
teacher training. 100 percent is significant. Forty-nine percent is significant.
But how do you come to the conclusion that programs that receive no funding at
all are significant?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Shaul</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Let me try and answer that question. The methodology that we use to group the
programs into three credit categories was one which we went through the
catalogue for domestic assistance which describes programs. Then we sent surveys
to each of the agencies and asked them about their programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We asked them to categorize whether
their program in their opinion had as a focus, a significant focus, teacher
training. Whether it was an exclusive, a significant focus or whether it was an
allowable activity but that it was not significant from their perspective. They
weren't necessarily making it on the determination of the percentage or the
number of dollars.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For example, if you take Title I, the
Education Department classifies that as an important program, a significant
program for teacher training, but only 2.5 percent of that program is spent on
teacher training, although it is $190 million.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, the other point to mention is that
many of these programs have local discretion, and so the decision in one year
could be to devote most of the program to teacher training or 50 percent or 30
percent. In another year it could be zero. So this represents the fiscal year
1999 plan.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Martinez</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
You are telling me then, that your study is based on self-declared information.
That reminds me of a story that is not related to this at all, but there is an
analogy. When I first came to work here in Washington, D.C. and I hired all my
staff people, a magazine reporter called my office and asked for the names of my
employees. And based on the names of my employees, he determined what
ethnicities were represented I had in my office.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, there was a woman by the name of
Ms. Grant who happened to be a Native American. He listed her as anglo. There
was a woman named Mrs. Bowman who happened to be black. He listed her as white.
Because of the name Bowman, he assumed she was white. It is the same thing here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Instead of self-declaration, the
purpose of a study like this is to allow us to consolidate programs and
eliminate those programs that aren’t effective. However, I don’t think, that
based on this chart and information, that I am willing to do that. I think we
need to use a different methodology in determing which are significant programs
and which are not significant programs.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the panel. I appreciate your testimony
and the broad spectrum of backgrounds represented on the panel. It is very
helpful to us.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am going to zero in on just one area,
and that is math/ science education, but I will ask each of you to respond to
these questions if it relates to your area of work.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Three questions. First one is, we spend
a lot of money in the Federal Government on professional development and other
activities, and yet our student performance in math and science has not been
good. It has gone down in some places. It barely held its own in other places.
Why? What's your opinion of why that is true?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second question, of all the activities
that you are aware of in the various departments, and there are quite a number
of departments as we have seen from Dr. Shaul's report, how does the performance
or the results of these various programs, activities, et cetera, compare to
those from the National Science Foundation programs?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now remember, we are restricting it
just to math and science programs. In other words, all the Department of
Education programs, health and human services, agriculture, all the various
programs listed, what is the impact and the beneficial effect of those programs
compared to the beneficial effect from the National Science Foundation programs?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And my final question, what is the best
way, in your mind, in your professional judgment, to improve student performance
in math and science? Are we taking the right track? For example, I noticed
almost all the programs are in service training rather than preservice. Should
we do much more with preservice training? I am just asking what in your mind, in
your professional judgment, is the best way to improve student performance in
math and science. I eagerly await your answers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Bauman first.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Bauman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
If I can jump in on that. I will try to answer them. First question, why isn't
student achievement where we would like it to be? If we use the TIMS data, it
shows that we start off pretty well and we kind of decline from there on out. We
can use that data to look at different things that we are doing in the
classrooms from the teaching and also from the curriculum standpoint.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In our work, we are really focusing on
the areas that TIMS data shows where we are lacking, such as mathematics,
geometry, becoming more focused; and a piece of our professional development is
helping teachers become more focused on their teaching and what they are
teaching so they go in greater depth without a Jeopardy trivia-type of rote
answering of multiple topics so they go in depth on fewer topics. The
professional development needs to coincide with that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Two, of all the activities, how do
results compare from like NSF projects? NSF projects tend to be fairly narrow in
their focus and they also tend to focus on specific regions. In our area, we
don't have NSF-funded projects.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We could be likened to what they do,
but we use all private money. We don't have access to their funds right now. So,
therefore, we can use the information learned from them and implement it in our
region but also using additional dollars from the Federal Government, such as
Eisenhower, which is very important. Had that not been there, I don't think we'd
be doing what we are doing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Best way to improve math and science,
focus on content, curriculum, and the professional development to match it and
the materials and equipment that go along with it. They all go hand in hand.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Ehlers</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you. Dr. Birman?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Birman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I can only elaborate on some of the points because I am in agreement with Dr.
Bauman on many of them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why is student performance not good,
again, echoing Dr. Bauman? The TIMS study indicates that there is a lot of
repetition of fairly basic skills over the life of the student and not enough
focus on depth knowledge of content area and, that is why we think that the
performance of students goes down as the years progress.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Or in the data, fourth graders do
better or eighth graders do better than twelfth graders in mathematics. We feel
that one reason is that teachers don't have that depth of content focus either
and, therefore, cannot teach the students as well as they need to.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So one of the things that we found in
our study is that focusing on content knowledge, not just the subject area but
also how students learn the subject, how students think about mathematics or
science, and what kinds of misconceptions students bring. That kind of very
detailed professional development seems to be the best bet with regard to
helping students to achieve better.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With regard to your second question
comparing to NSF, there is very little actual information with regard to
outcomes. In fact, we feel that our study is one of the first that deals on a
national level with professional development looking at teachers' performance
and outcomes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was a study not just of NSF but
of many exemplary programs throughout the government, and we find that the IHE
portion of the Eisenhower program, for example, does about as well with regard
to reported teacher outcomes as those exemplary programs. The district part of
the Eisenhower program doesn't do quite as well, though we are finding that
there are some improvements in the district part of that program as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Regarding the best way to improve
student performance: I think I would agree again that the focus on content would
be key and then the professional development that would support that would have
to occur over a long time frame to help teachers to engage with students or to
actually look at what students are doing; professional development that links
the learning of teachers to other activities to standards and assessments and so
forth.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Those kinds of things we feel are the
best ways to improve teaching and ultimately student performance. But frankly,
there are very few studies. We conducted a literature review with regard to the
effect of professional development on student performance and found virtually a
handful of studies that looked at that issue.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I was just going to elaborate on your last question if I could. Regarding the
best way to improve student learning, what we found in our district is that
teachers need to see the direct connection between their student assessment
results, how are the kids doing on unit tests and final exams and the State or
the national standards, and that their professional development must be embedded
in their daily work design for them to make that connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A summer workshop is an excellent
beginning to getting strong content knowledge background, but embedded
professional development has to be the instructional strategies, the appropriate
use of materials and being able to engage in experimentation and reflection.
Coaching with their principals needs to be embedded in day-to-day work so team
planning time, before and after school time, use of monies and comprehensive
school reform models where we don't separate curriculum from assessment from
instructional strategies from grouping practices and school organization
practices.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Teachers live in the real world every
day in their classrooms and need to have a holistic approach in their school
building to their own professional development and the connections in seeing
their students' results.</font></p>

Well, certainly we don't know as much as we could know about the professional
development of teachers nationwide. A lot of the information about professional
development is in very small studies, some of them very useful but still studies
of a few teachers or a few schools or even one or two school districts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is very little national
information, say, from a national sample such as the data we collected; a
national sample of teachers or a national sample of school districts where you

another, of how teachers' experiences compared to one another.</font></p>

included programs that support teacher training in a variety of ways such as
providing books and other supplies. I want to know how many of the 87 programs
support professional development versus how many actually provide professional
development. Some support is kind of vague, but how many actually would you say
are doing professional development?</font></p>

Of the 87 programs that we looked at, there were a total of 51 that either had
teacher training, professional development as their soul focus, or who said that
that was an important or significant part of their activities.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I would say the 36 programs that simply
allow for teacher training probably are not providing a great deal of
professional development. They reported to us, although sometimes they didn't
have data. The data that we do have would show that it is less than 1 percent of

This Committee has been pretty hard on teacher training institutions the last
several years. We hope that you are all making them understand that they have to
do a far better job preparing teachers for the 21st century. I don't know how
much we can do, but obviously it is necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Shaul, you don't know how much pain
and suffering the General Accounting Office has caused me over 24 years: 700
education-related programs spread over every agency in downtown; 160 job
training programs spread over 30 some agency departments; 13 agencies, 87
programs, some support for teacher training.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, we have what is called
the pride of authorship, which is very important in the Congress of the United
States, and we are having a difficult time breaking that down. I have given up.
I used to run over when I am sitting in my office listening to someone introduce
a program on the floor, and I would run over and say I know you realize we
already have that program on the books. The answer was always, well, one more
won't hurt. And I guess one more won't hurt; but oh my, if we could ever get
them coordinated, we could probably spend money far better. So you do your job
well because I am pained and I am suffering.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Birman, I was glad to hear you talk
about content focus. I have said many times I hired an awful lot of elementary
teachers, many of which had very little math and science in high school and none
in college, and they are expected to teach all subjects and somehow or another
turn youngsters on to math and science at an early age when they've never been
turned on themselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So we have been telling that to the
teacher training institutions also, how important that is, particularly for
those -- well, for all teachers. But if the elementary teacher has to teach all
subjects, they should have something more than how to teach a course in math. It
doesn't do you much good knowing how to teach if you don't know the content.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And Dr. Bauman, I was glad to hear your
emphasis on the importance of Eisenhower for you to leverage other money. You
said something about 125 hours, and I wasn't sure whether you were saying that
in your programs that it is a 125-hour program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I mention that primarily because I am
always happy when I am down here on the day that my wife, who has been teaching
for 40 years, is having an in-service day, because then I don't have to go home
at night and hear, how could they ever take me away from my students and send me
to something as stupid as that and as meaningless as that. Were you saying if
you complete your program, it is 125 hours?</font></p>

Spread out over a three-year period, and that is summers and during the school
year. We feel it is very important that there is continuity and building upon
each additional session. So teachers are out of the classroom any way from two
to four days during the school year, spend up to four or five days during the
summer depending upon the cycle thereon within the institute.</font></p>

These are full-day sessions with the teachers. Two weeks ago, one teacher as she
was packing up her equipment and going back to the classroom told me that when
she told her students she was leaving the next day, the response was, cool, does
that mean you are coming back with more of that science stuff for us to do. So
the students automatically are noting the connection to what she's doing as

We attribute it to the focus on teacher training and professional development.
Our students are doing better on tests. My colleague at Garrison elementary
school in Northwest, Mrs. Abney, a student scored above the national norm in
reading last year. This was primarily do to the implementing of the NICHD
program which focuses on teacher training, professional development, and
abundance of rich literature, mentoring, and tutoring support for our students.</font></p>

read, I know that the students I have been working with for the last three years
would be achieving so much better than they did.</font></p>

frustration not knowing what to do. And I think he is a completely transformed

given good training or materials and now the results are very different.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet, let me just ask. You
mentioned the comprehensive school reform at the top. What have your
observations been on the role that teacher development has made in most of the
comprehensive school reform programs that you might have come across? Is that a
large component of many of the programs?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
It is a large component. We are a school district of 12 schools. Six of our 12
schools are in comprehensive school reforms. Three are successes for all, and
three are modern red schoolhouses; and for us as a district, the blessing of
comprehensive school reform is that it comes as a package.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The curriculum, the assessment, the
professional development, the grouping strategies, the leadership training, all
of it comes as part of the best practices research base that Dr. Moats talked
about, so that a busy, building school principal isn't having to pull all of the
research and try to put the elements together. It has made a significant impact
in our district.</font></p>

I'm glad to hear you say that. I think the only shame of that is that it hasn't
gone from a demonstration program to implementation. We have to do something
about that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Moats, how important is it for a
teacher seeking professional development to have connection to an academic
institution? Is that a necessary part of the development?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Moats</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
No, I don't feel it is, especially with what is being offered through academic
institutions at the present time. In fact, unfortunately, in the field of
reading, some of the best training for teachers is available through private
vendors, if you will, or just institutions that have perfected the art of
teaching teachers how to teach children to read.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I think, in fact, it is the private
sector and the consumers who are having an influence now on what universities
are offering, and it has been the pressure from those who need to know and get
the job done that has actually transformed teacher preparation in colleges.</font></p>

Who serves as a clearinghouse, or somebody, that can inform school districts of
what is available out there? How does a principal know or a group of teachers

I can tell you as a school district what we do is use the comprehensive school
reform legislation that has nine key criteria for what quality programs look
like, and we write our professional development strands in each school
improvement plans.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So the principal and the teachers look
at their student achievement needs and determine where the gaps of knowledge are
for the students and then match to the research best practices what professional
development would align with that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Seremet</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
If it is a comprehensive school reform model they will. Otherwise, we depend on
our principals, and in our district five supervisors, to be screening the

Mr. Chairman, I know we have to leave, and I wouldn't want these folks to come
back just for my questions. I will make an observation, and Dr. Moats can tell
me if I am right or wrong. When Congressman Owens made his comment about teacher
preparation when he served for 17 years, I have become convinced that the single
most important thing we can do to improve teacher training in public education
would be to require every college of education and every professor in it to
teach one out of every three or four years in the public schools of the United
States of America.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is a disconnect between theory
and the applied technology of teaching children to which Dr. Moats' program is a
specific example; and you tell me if I am wrong, Doctor, but there are three
components you have in your program for reading. Number one, your college of
education or your instructors at the University of Houston, yourself anyway,
must have been involved in the D.C. schools by actually going into them and
working with those teachers; is that correct?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Moats</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Isakson</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Number two, the biggest deficiency in America in teaching reading is that there
is not the option for our teachers to use phonics as well as whole language and
other practices. And from reading what you have here, you introduced both those
techniques and made them available as an optional best practice for the
teachers; is that correct?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Moats</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
We are requiring that all the teachers know how to teach all of the components
well including phonemic awareness and phonics. It is not an option for us. It is
a necessity.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Isakson</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
That is the implication of what I meant. And third and last, Mr. Chairman, I
only observed the most expensive Federal or State program in the United States
of America and public education, which is reading recovery. The largest single
contribution to school dropouts in America is the inability of a child to read,
therefore bringing about low self-esteem and many of the other problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So I commend what you are doing. I hope
you will make it available to others as we develop programs, one to get
universities back in gauge with actually teaching in the classroom or observing
it; and, two, focusing on reading. With that, Mr. Chairman, I won't go any
