        <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="5">Independent GAO Testimony
        Confirms Need for Greater Collaboration Between Head Start, Other
        Childhood Programs</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a hearing
        yesterday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and
        Pensions (HELP), Marnie S. Shaul, the Director of Education, Workforce,
        and Income Security Issues for the General Accounting Office (GAO)
        testified that barriers to collaboration among programs administered by
        states and Head Start are impeding the effectiveness of all of these
        programs. The School Readiness Act (H.R. 2210), authored by Education
        Reform Subcommittee Chairman Mike Castle (R-DE), would address these
        barriers by allowing states to coordinate federal childcare programs,
        state-run pre-kindergarten programs and Head Start.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Ms. Shaul’s testimony,
        which is available at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03840t.pdf, “barriers
        sometimes exist, making it difficult to blend services offered across
        programs to meet the demands of families.” These barriers are
        exacerbated by the fact that states administer the vast majority of
        programs that provide early childhood care and education. Even programs
        funded by the federal government, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy
        Families (TANF) and the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), are
        administered by the state governments, and are therefore easy to
        coordinate with state-run preschool programs. Only Head Start lies
        outside this existing network of collaboration.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">House Committee on Education and the
        Workforce Chairman John Boehner (R-OH), an original cosponsor of the
        School Readiness Act, said “The GAO testimony today underscores what
        supporters of Head Start reform have been saying since this bill was
        first introduced: barriers to coordination and collaboration are
        preventing disadvantaged children from getting the best this nation has
        to offer.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">“The School Readiness Act, by
        increasing collaboration among the various state and federal programs
        will ensure that the maximum number of children are served by programs
        that maintain the highest standards,” Boehner continued. “Collaboration
        will help close the readiness gap between Head Start graduates and their
        more affluent peers.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ms. Shaul also testified that the
        practical implications of a lack of effective collaboration are very
        real. She said, “To meet the demands of families, some federal
        programs require coordination of services among early childhood
        education and care programs. To illustrate, most Head Start programs are
        predominately part day, part year programs, and they cannot meet the
        demands of working families who need full-day, full-year education and
        care services. In response to this requirement, some Head Start programs
        collaborate with other programs to provide families full day coverage.
        However, <u>differing program eligibility requirements and other
        coordination barriers sometimes impede coordination efforts</u>.”
        (Emphasis added).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Boehner added, “GAO’s independent
        testimony demonstrates that a lack of coordination among programs
        administered by the states and Head Start results in gaps in service,
        and difficulty providing the full-day, full-year preschool program that
        many children in single-parent families, or in families with two working
        parents, require. Ms. Shaul and GAO correctly note that ‘much has
        changed in society since Head Start was established nearly 40 years ago.’
        Unfortunately, not enough has changed in the Head Start program to
        ensure that all barriers to coordinating state and federal programs are
        removed. The School Readiness Act would take the first steps towards
        guaranteeing that all early care and education programs are coordinated
        at all levels, making certain that the maximum number of children can
        receive the valuable services that Head Start and other programs have to
        offer.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">By giving states with a demonstrated
        commitment to early childhood education the opportunity to coordinate
        existing pre-school programs and federal child care grants such as TANF
        and CCDBG with Head Start, the School Readiness Act would eliminate the
        barriers to coordination that are preventing too many children from
        getting the quality pre-school program that they deserve. As an earlier
        HHS report also noted, problems with collaboration can also have a
        negative effect on school readiness, perpetuating the current readiness
        gap between Head Start graduates and their more affluent peers.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">H.R. 2210 is expected to come before the
        full House of Representatives for a vote later this week.</font></p>
