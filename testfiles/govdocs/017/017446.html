<P ALIGN="justify">In the spring of 1935, during the depths of the Great
Depression, three men met for several nights in the village of Snaketown
just north of the dry carcass of the Gila River. One was Julian Hayden,
a young archaeologist working on the excavation of the Hohokam site at
Snaketown under the direction of Emil Haury. Another was William Allison
Smith, the foreman of the digging crew, an Akimel O'odham who spoke
English and was a Presbyterian deacon in the Snaketown church. The third
was Juan Smith, one of the last narrators of the full Pima version of
the O'odham creation story (Bahr et al 1994).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There, in an old mesquite-roofed adobe storeroom,
Smith recited the thirty-six stories that reveal O'odham history from
the creation of the universe to the end of the Apache wars. Allison
Smith translated Smith's Pima narration into English. Hayden scribbled
furiously to record the word-for-word transcript. One evening, Hayden
also snapped a picture of Smith by the light of a Coleman lantern. Smith
is seated in front of a jumble of wagon wheels leaning against an adobe
wall. His broad face, framed by a shock of black hair, is patient and
intent. You can almost smell the dry, dark earth enclosing the three
men.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The text, in English with a sprinkling of Pima words,
is one of the most complete glimpses we have into the O'odham world
before the Europeans arrived. The first part is a Pima Genesis. A pure
spirit named Jeoss [<A HREF="chap2n.htm#1">1</A>] heavens out of
darkness. Then he makes Earth <I>Doctor&#151;Jewed Ma:kai</I>&#151;who
fashions another being, <I>Siuuhu.</I> Earth Doctor and Siuuhu take
clay, shape a man, and breathe life into him. They do the same to
produce a woman. These two first humans become the original ancestors of
the Pimas.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">After them, Earth Doctor and Siuuhu create the dawn,
the sun, the deer, the jackrabbit, the windstorm, the clouds, and the
rain. Grasses spring up after the rain. "The woman went out and picked
some of the grass and took it and cooked it and ate it," Smith recited.
"When through eating, the man went out with bow and arrow and killed a
deer, and they had it for supper that evening. At that time, the sun
went down, and darkness fell over the earth, as it had been before. This
was the end of the first day" (Bahr et al 1994:49).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Creation continues with the making of the moon,
Coyote, the Milky Way, and Buzzard, who shapes the mountains. A great
flood destroys this first creation. In other versions of the narrative,
the flood is caused by the tears of a baby born from the penis of a
promiscuous young man. Only Earth Doctor, Siuuhu, and Coyote survive.
Earth Doctor returns to the heavens, but Coyote and Siuuhu take refuge
in a flute and a house. Siuuhu emerges first and begins to be called
<I>S-e'ehe,</I> or Elder Brother. Later in the narrative, he is also
called I'itoi.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This is where the creation narrative leaves the realm
of mythology and enters "prehistory." In Smith's account, the first
people all die. In others, however, they take refuge in the underworld
after Earth Doctor opens a passage into the earth with his cane. Siuuhu
then makes more people, including the O'odham, whom he teaches how to
cultivate a variety of crops, including corn, cotton, and tobacco. A
series of stories follow with two interwoven themes: the domestication
of plants and the domestication of sexual relations. The people also
learn to make saguaro wine and to irrigate their fields from canals.
Anthropologist Donald Bahr (Bahr et al 1994) calls these tales the
"Hohokam chronicles" because they tell the story of the people who built
the great platform mound communities like Casa Grande along the Salt and
Gila rivers.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As these people's mastery of canal irrigation grows,
their societies become more complex. The origins of turquoise and
parrots&#151;two highly prized items that linked the Hohokam in trade
networks extending from the Four Corners to Mesoamerica&#151;are
explained. Warfare breaks out and Siuuhu pioneers the four-day ceremony
to purify warriors after they have killed. The Hohokam grow so arrogant
they kill Siuuhu himself.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It is here in the narrative that "history" begins.
After four years of death, Siuuhu resurrects himself and contacts the
people Earth Doctor either created or saved. They agree to join him in
making war against his killers. The people who accompany Siuuhu are
called Wooshkum or Vupshkam <I>(Wu:skam),</I> which means "Emerger" or
"Emergent." They arise from the underworld far to the east. Medicine men
among both the Hohokam and the Wu:skam have visions about the impending
conflict. The Hohokam medicine men try to conceal their communities. The
Wu:skam medicine men attempt to divine their locations.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Finally, however, battle is joined. The Wu:skam send
an owl to frighten the Hohokam, a gopher to chew up their weapons, and a
rattlesnake to bite and kill a powerful <I>Siva&ntilde;</I> (chief).
Then they descend upon a series of communities with Great Houses
<I>(Vahki)</I> beginning with Casa Grande, killing the medicine men
chiefs and routing their followers. In addition to Casa Grande, Smith's
narrative and the more fragmentary narratives recorded by others mention
communities that can be identified as Sweetwater, Casa Blanca, Lower
Santan, Upper Santan, Los Muertos, Los Hornos, and Pueblo Grande, ruled
by the powerful priest-chief Yellow Buzzard (Teague 1993; Bahr et al
1994). According to archaeologist Lynn Teague, "The settlements
identified in the oral traditions are an archaeologically accurate
inventory of the late Classic period platform mound sites along a
lengthy segment of the Gila River. Further, it can be shown that the
ethnohistoric reports provide an account of these settlements too
accurate and detailed to have been simply a tale created to explain the
existence of numerous sites in the region" (Teague 1993:440).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In other words, O'odham living in the northern
Sonoran Desert in the twentieth century possessed a detailed oral
tradition that their ancestors conquered the Hohokam living in the same
area 400 to 500 years earlier. According to the creation narratives, the
Hohokam rulers and some of their followers died while others fled west
to the Colorado River or north to Zuni country and the Hopi mesas. But
others were incorporated into O'odham society, perhaps into the Buzzard
moiety (Hayden 1970). As such, the creation narratives contain
tantalizing slivers of evidence about the antiquity of the O'odham in
Arizona and their relation to the Hohokam.</P>

<P><BR><B><I>The Hohokam-Piman Continuum and the Tepiman
Connection</I></B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The nature of that relationship remains a matter of
debate. Most archaeologists believe in some variant of the Hohokam-Piman
continuum, which contends that the Upper Pimas of Arizona are biological
and cultural descendants of the Hohokam. After Hohokam civilization
collapsed because of social conflict, environmental degradation, or
perhaps even the devastation of Old World epidemic diseases, the Pimas
were the remnants who survived (Haury 1945, 1950, 1976; Simpson 1946;
Gumerman and Haury 1979; Doyel 1979, 1991; Reff 1991; Dobyns 1988; Ezell
1963). Charles DiPeso, on the other hand, argued that the Hohokam
intruded upon the O'odham, who had been living in the northern Sonoran
Desert since Archaic times (DiPeso 1956, 1979; see also McGuire 1991). A
third scenario, advanced by ethnohistorian Bernard Fontana (1976) and
ethnobiologist Amadeo Rea (1983, 1997), views the Upper Pimas as
relatively recent newcomers who moved into the region as Hohokam
civilization was disintegrating. Because they had no public architecture
that rivaled the platform mounds of the Classic Hohokam, because they
buried rather than burned their corpses, and because they relied upon
small-scale rather than massive irrigation systems, Rea argues that the
Upper Pimas were too different from the Hohokam to be "the degenerate
remnants of a pre-existing Puebloan or puebloid desert culture" (Rea
1997:8).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The debate is complicated even further by the
so-called "Tepiman connection." People speaking Piman languages within
the far-flung Uto-Aztecan language family extend from central Arizona to
northern Jalisco. They include the Upper Pimas (Akimel and Tohono
O'odham), who occupied most of southern Arizona and northern Sonora when
the Europeans colonized the Pimer&iacute;a Alta in the late 1600s. They
encompass the Lower Pimas of central Sonora: the N&eacute;vome, who
lived along the middle R&iacute;o Sonora and R&iacute;o Yaqui, the
Mountain Pimas, who occupied the western foothills of the Sierra Madre
Occidental, and a number of poorly understood groups such as the
Cocomacaques, who ranged across the desert north and west of modern
Hermosillo. Tepiman speakers also comprise the Northern Tepehuan of
Chihuahua, the Southern Tepehuan of Durango, and the Tepecano of
northern Jalisco. This long s-shaped curve of Piman speakers, broken by
Taracahitan speakers (Yaquis, Mayos, Warihios, and Tarahumaras) in
southern Sonora and Chihuahua, snakes for a thousand miles across the
deserts and mountains of North America.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The languages of these people, who call themselves
O'odham, O'odaam, Ootoma, and Odami, are so closely related that
linguists Kenneth Hale and David Harris state, "It is somewhat
misleading to speak of time-depth within Piman; it is more probable
that, until very recent times, Piman represented a more or less
continuous chain of dialects belonging to a single language" (Hale and
Harris 1979:176). Linguistic anthropologists David Shaul and Jane Hill
(1998) observe that the various Tepiman languages share cognate
densities of 74.4 percent to 86.4 percent, suggesting that they split
from one another a millenium ago; a rough glottochronological rule of
thumb is that cognancy of 80.5% represents a divergence of about 1,000
years. "Glottochronological dates should, of course, be used only with
great caution," they go on to say, "but the fact that the lowest
percentage of shared cognacy within Tepiman (between Southeastern
Tepehuan and Tohono O'odham) is 73 percent is consistent with a
hypothesis that the proto-Tepiman speech community existed sometime
during the first millenium A.D., well within the Hohokam period" (Shaul
and Hill 1998:379). Relationships between Hohokam and O'odham in
Arizona, then, have to be viewed within a much larger framework, one
that encompasses a world of Tepiman speakers that climbs from the
creosote flats of the Phoenix Basin to the pine uplands of the Sierra
Madre Occidental.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Archaeologist David Wilcox (1986) speculates that
this corridor of Tepiman speakers was the principal route over which
elements of Mesoamerican civilization diffused into the Southwest. Rea,
in contrast, believes that the ancestors of the O'odham were "invaders"
from further south in the Sonoran Desert. "Their northward expansion
into former Hohokam country I see as relatively recent, perhaps
stimulated by Old World diseases that swept through northwestern New
Spain every few years (Reff 1991:16, 132-274; Roberts 1989)," Rea
argues. "This view is not inconsisent with archaeological evidence to
date (Ravelsoot and Whittlesey 1987). The protohistoric Piman period in
southern Arizona thus may be temporally shallow" (Rea 1997:8).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Shaul and Hill (1998), in contrast, present evidence
that the center of maximum linguistic diversity in Tepiman is in the
north, suggesting that Proto-Tepiman may have originated there. They
also examine both phonological and lexical borrowing between Yuman and
Tepiman languages, expanding upon arguments made by Shaul and Andresen
(1989).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Proto-Tepiman word for water, <I>*suu-dagi</I>
for example, is found in some form in all Tepiman languages, even though
the Proto-Uto-Aztecan root for water is <I>**pa-.</I> The Tepiman
languages retain that Proto-Uto-Aztecan root as <I>*va-</I> only in
combining forms (e.g., wa:k "reedy place" in Tohono O'odham). The words
for water itself probably derive from River Yuman words for "blue,
green" including the sequence <I>hava:s&uacute;,</I> which the Tepimans
may have interpreted as 'their-water-green/blue' and may have used in
ritual contexts. Because some form of the element <I>-su</I> is found in
all Tepiman languages, the borrowing from Proto-Yuman to Proto-Tepiman
must have occurred where the two groups were in contact, i.e. in the
northwestern Sonoran Desert near the Colorado River.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Shaul and Hill (1998), again following Shaul and
Andreson (1989), point out that Upper Piman dialects exhibit phonemic
borrowing from Yuman as well. Most salient is the hardening of a system
of glides to produce a new series of stops, which sets Tepiman apart
from most other Uto-Aztecan languages but is also found in River Yuman.
"In Tepiman, the Proto-Uto-Aztecan (PUA) glides **y and **w, and the PUA
labiovelar **k<SUP>w</SUP> 'hardened,'" they note. "PUA **y became
Proto-Tepiman (PT) *d. PUA **w became PT *g. PUA **k<SUP>w</SUP> became
PT *b. This resulted in a distinctive array of 'voiced' stops, *b, * d,
*g, in all the Tepiman languages, contrasting with a 'voiceless' series,
inherited unchanged from PUA as *p, *t, *k," (Shaul and Hill 1998:379).
The PUA word for 'nose' <I>(yaka),</I> for example, became <I>daka</I>
in PT, <I>da:k</I> in Tohono O'odham and <I>daka</I> in Northern
Tepehuan but <I>yahk&aacute;</I> in Guarijio and <I>yeka</I> in Yaqui.
"Comparative lingiustic method argues that it is more parsimonious in
such a case to assume that the change took place before the breakup of
Proto-Tepiman into its present daughter languages rather than to assume
that the change arose independently in every single daughter language,"
Shaul and Hill (1998:379) argue.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to their reconstruction, Proto-Tepiman and
River Yuman groups lived in close association with one another in
southwestern Arizona for several centuries around 1,000 A.D. "Speakers
of Proto-Tepiman and Proto-River Yuman were probably in a sufficiently
intense contact with one another for a substantial population of
bilinguals to exist, among whom convergences developed in the sound
system, the morpho-syntactic system, and to a limited degree in the
lexicon of the two languages," Shaul and Hill (1998:392) postulate. They
also contend that Proto-Tepimans expanded from the north to the south
rather than vice-versa. Following and elaborating upon the argument of
Fowler (1983), Shaul and Hill believe that the Proto-Tepiman word
<I>*ha:sani</I> refers specifically to the saguaro <I>(Carnegiea
gigantea),</I> as it does in modern Akimel and Tohono O'odham, and not
just to any tall cactus with edible fruit. If so, Proto-Tepiman would
have originated within the biogeographic range of the saguaro, rather
than further south. Proto-Tepimans were not Mesoamerican immigrants to
the Sonoran Desert. On the contrary, Proto-Tepimans, Proto-River Yumans,
and probably some Zunis [<A HREF="chap2n.htm#2">2</A>] part of the Late
Classic Hohokam system.</P>

<P><BR><B><I>O'odham and Hohokam Regional Systems in the Late Classic
Period</I></B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Shaul and Hill do not make the same claim for
speakers of the modern Upper Piman languages, Tohono O'odham and Akimel
O'odham. The most innovative modern dialect of Tohono
O'odham&#151;Aji/Totogua&ntilde;, which dominates most of the
Papagueria, including areas where Hohokam archaeological remains are
located&#151;may instead reflect people who "spread into abandoned
Hohokam regions in the late prehistoric period. This is also consistent
with Aji-Totogua&ntilde; oral tradition that they represent a later
emergence from underground, which resulted in their displacing
autochthonous peoples&#151;the Hohokam&#151;in their region" (Shaul and
Hill 1998:391). In other words, the ancestors of the modern O'odham may
indeed be Rea's invaders from the south.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">None of this evidence is conclusive. When all the
strands are woven together, however, one possible scenario
emerges&#151;a scenario that incorporates the insights of Rea as well as
Shaul and Hill. A thousand years ago, Proto-Tepimans lived in close
proximity to River Yumans and may have participated in the Classic
florescence of the Hohokam. Other Proto-Tepimans, in contrast, moved
south through the Sonoran Desert and into the foothills and upland
valleys of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Gradually, linguistic and
cultural distinctions emerged. Sometime in the fifteenth or sixteenth
century, however, the ancestors of the Akimel O'odham and the Tohono
O'odham who speak the Aji-Totogua&ntilde; dialect turned their eyes
northward once again and entered Hohokam territory from the southeast,
perhaps along the San Pedro or upper Santa Cruz drainages. These O'odham
helped overthrow the Hohokam elites controlling the platform-mound
communities along the Gila River.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">No mention is made of battles fought along the Salt
River. A disastrous flood in 1358 A.D. may have washed out the
irrigation systems of Hohokam communities there and prompted their
abandonment a century or more before the invaders arrived (Doelle and
Wallace 1990). Whether the conquerors were seizing new territory or
reclaiming ancestral homelands remains to be determined. Nonetheless,
the modern Akimel O'odham and Tohono O'odham do not appear to be the
biological or cultural descendants of the Late Classic Hohokam elites
themselves (Sheridan in press).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Pimas of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro river
valleys, on the other hand, may have been descendants of the people who
occupied those watersheds during Late Classic times. Doelle and Wallace
(1990) argue that three smaller regional systems&#151;organized around
communities dominated by platform mounds&#151;existed south of the
Phoenix Basin, the Salt-Gila heartland of the Hohokam. One was along the
lower San Pedro. Another was in the Tucson Basin. The third clustered in
the eastern foothills of the Coyote Mountains. These regional systems
may have reflected tribal or ethnic differences in southern Arizona.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Doelle and Wallace (1990) also believe that the
settlement patterns, ceramic distribution, and architectural features of
all three systems exhibit evidence of increasing warfare during the
Classic period. Villages become larger and more aggregated. Large,
depopulated "buffer zones" separate the systems from one another and
from the Phoenix Basin itself. Some of the platform mound communities,
particularly in the lower San Pedro, are located on easily defensible
alluvial mesas. O'odham populations in these regional systems may have
adopted many of the ideological and sociopolitical trappings of the
Phoenix Basin Hohokam but resisted their attempts to control them. The
battles recorded in the Hohokam chronicles of the Gila Pimas may have
been part of a larger pattern of conflict that wracked Arizona in late
precolumbian times. The very presence of platform mounds themselves
suggests hierarchy and conflict. In the words of Henri Lefebvre,
"Monumentality...always embodies and imposes a clearly intelligible
message. It says what it wishes to say&#151;yet it hides a good deal
more: being political, military, and ultimately fascist in character,
monumental buildings mask the will to power and the arbitrariness of
power beneath signs and surfaces which claim to express collective will
and collective thought" (Lefebvre 1991:143).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There undoubtedly were other regional systems as
well&#151;systems outside the orbit of the Phoenix Basin Hohokam. The
Upper Santa Cruz does not seem to belong to the Tucson Basin system.
There are no platform mounds south of Martinez Hill and no large late
Classic sites along the river between the Tucson Basin and Palo Parado
south of Tumac&aacute;cori. The frequency of Gila Polychrome plummets
while the percentage of pottery types from the south such as Trincheras
??? rises (Henry Wallace, personal communication). Archaeologist David
Wilcox, who reanalyzed Charles DiPeso's excavation of Palo Parado Ruin,
concluded that Palo Parado "appears to lie near the northern end of a
settlement system different from the one in the Tucson Basin" (Wilcox
1987:241). Wilcox goes on to say, "Other sites similar to the Classic
component at Palo Parado exist in the Rio Rico area, and sites as far up
the Santa Cruz as the San Rafael Valley exhibit analogously aggregated
compound site structure (Sauer and Brand 1931; Damson 1946; personal
observation)." Because most of the dwellings at Palo Parado were burned
at the same time, Wilcox believes that the community may have been the
victim of "regional warfare in the 14th century"&#151;another indication
of escalating tension and bloodshed in late Classic times (Wilcox
1987:239). [<A HREF="chap2n.htm#3">3</A>] Perhaps the inhabitants of
Palo Parado and other settlements in the upper Santa Cruz belonged to
that division of the O'odham who went on to topple the platform-mound
communities along the Gila a century or two later.</P>

<P><BR><B><I>The Sobaipuris and Their Neighbors</I></B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Conflict continued to divide the people of southern
Arizona when Europeans first settled there in the late 1600s, two
centuries after Hohokam civilization disintegrated. When Jesuit
missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino crisscrossed the Pimer&iacute;a Alta
in the early 1690s, he mentioned two cases of warfare among the O'odham
themselves. The first pitted the western Sobas of the R&iacute;o de la
Concepci&oacute;n drainage against the eastern Pimas of the Dolores
Valley, who sought revenge because the Sobas had killed Podenco, headman
of Dolores, a decade or so earlier. The second matched Sobaipuris under
El Coro in the middle San Pedro Valley against ??? Sobaipuris under El
Humari along the lower San Pedro. Meanwhile, nomadic groups identified
as Sumas, Mansos, Janos, Jocomes, and Apaches raided O'odham living
along both the San Pedro and the Gila. The region was no more stable in
the late 17th century than it had been in the 14th and 15th
centuries.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The political dynamics of the 1500s and early 1600s
are less clear. Alvar N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca and his fellow
<I>n&aacute;ufragos</I> (shipwrecked ones) may have nicked southeastern
Arizona in the 1530s, but recent ethnobotanical evidence suggests that
they traveled across northern Mexico, not the southwestern United States
(Olson et al 1997). [<A HREF="chap2n.htm#4">4</A>] The expedition of
Francisco V&aacute;squez de Coronado passed to the east, perhaps through
the San Pedro Valley, but neither Coronado nor his chroniclers had much
to say about that stretch of their journey. Not until the advent of Kino
in 1687 do the O'odham of southern Arizona begin to take shape on
European paper. The descriptions of Kino and his companions,
particularly Juan Mateo Manje, provide our first indisputable window
into the O'odham world. Unfortunately, that window opens more than a
century after European influences, including European diseases, may have
buffeted O'odham society and culture (Reff 1991).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino and Manje distinguished among different groups
of O'odham, including the <I>Sobas</I> along the R&iacute;o de la
Concepci&oacute;n and the <I>Papabotas</I> [Papagos] between the Tucson
Basin and the Colorado River (Fontana 1995; Sheridan 1988). The
distinction between those they called <I>Pimas</I> and those they named
<I>Sobaipuris,</I> a term with no known etymology, is less clear.
According to historian Herbert Bolton, "In the southeastern portion of
the area, nearest the Spanish settlements, were the people then regarded
as the Pimas proper. They lived on all the slopes of the watershed which
zigzags roughly westward from Huachuca Mountain to Nogales, having
villages on the upper waters of the south-flowing Sonora, San Miguel,
and Coc&oacute;spora [sic; Coc&oacute;spera] rivers, on the west-flowing
San Ignacio and Altar, and on the north-flowing San Pedro and Santa
Cruz" (Bolton 1984:247). He goes on to say, "North of the Pimas proper
lived the Soba&iacute;puris (Sobaj&iacute;puris). A line drawn eastward
from Tubac through Fairbank approximates the old boundary between the
two peoples. Of the Soba&iacute;puris there were three groups: one
living all down the San Pedro River northward from the vicinity of
Fairbank; another on the middle Santa Cruz between San Xavier del Bac
and Picacho; a third on the Gila River from the Casa Grande westward
nearly to the Bend of Gila River" (Bolton 1984:247).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">If Bolton's reconstruction is correct, the
distribution of Pimas in the Santa Cruz and San Pedro watersheds in the
late 17th century parallels the cultural and political divisions of the
late Classic. But what do Kino and Manje themselves say? Kino first
encountered Sobaipuris in January 1691, when he accompanied Father
Visitor Juan Mar&iacute;a Salvatierra on his inspection of the O'odham
communities of the R&iacute;o Magdalena-Altar-Concepci&oacute;n
watershed. Kino and Salvatierra planned to return to Coc&oacute;spera
but Sobaipuris from Bac and Tumagacori [Tumac&aacute;cori] intercepted
them with crosses and implored them to visit their settlements as
well.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">At Tucubavia, in the headwaters of the Altar, the two
missionaries veered northeast to the "Valley of Guebavi" and reached
Tumac&aacute;cori. There, according to Kino, they met with "some of the
Sobaipuris [sic] headmen, who had come twenty and twenty-five leagues
from the north," presumably from Bac and other O'odham communities in
the Tucson Basin (Bolton 1919 1:119). Kino noted that there were "more
than forty houses close together" at Tumac&aacute;cori. Kino and
Salvatierra then headed south to "the rancher&iacute;a of Guebaui
[Guevavi] and the valley and rancher&iacute;a of Santa Maria [Santa
Mar&iacute;a Suamca, now the pueblo of Santa Cruz, Sonora], a journey of
fifteen leagues, where we remained five days, catechizing and baptizing
infants and adults" (Bolton 1919 I:120). Kino's short account seems to
indicate that the Pimas from the Tumac&aacute;cori-Guevavi area were in
close contact with, and may even have been subordinate to, Sobaipuris
from the north.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino visited the Sobaipuris a second time in late
August and early September of 1692. His first destination was the
"valley and river of Santa Mar&iacute;a" [the Santa Cruz], where he
"found the natives very affable and friendly, and particularly so in the
principal rancher&iacute;a of San Xavier del Bac, which contains more
than eight hundred souls" (Bolton 1919 I:122). From there he turned east
and dropped into the San Pedro Valley. "Captain Coro and the rest of
them received me with all kindness," he noted. Then he added, "It is
true that I found them still somewhat less docile than the foregoing of
the west [the Sobaipuris at Bac]" (Bolton 1919 1I:123). Despite his
relentlessly optimistic promotion of the Pimer&iacute;a Alta, Kino's
comment about the Sobaipuris of the San Pedro suggests that these
O'odham were true frontiersmen&#151;independent, a little unruly,
willing to ally themselves with the charismatic Jesuit but not ready to
accept the discipline missionization entailed.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Following the 1695 rebellion in the western
Pimer&iacute;a Alta, many Spaniards accused the Sobaipuris, who had not
participated in the revolt, of allying themselves with the Jocomes and
stealing livestock. "It was falsely reported, also, that these Pimas
were involved in the tumults and revolts of Taraumara, on the testimony
of the Taraumares themselves," Kino angrily responded, "but the
Taraumares could not have been speaking of the Pimas of this
Pimer&iacute;a, who are more than one hundred and fifty leagues distant
from the Taraumares, but only of the Pimas near them, who are those of
Tapipa and near Yecora" (Bolton 1919 I:163).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino devoted much of his energy countering these
accusations and others, including one that the "Pimas of the interior
[to the north] and their neighbors were such cannibals that they roasted
and ate people" (Bolton 1919 I:163). Because he realized that Sobaipuri
goodwill was essential if the Jesuits were ever going to expand their
missions to the Gila River or reconvert the "apostate" Moquis (Hopis),
Kino wanted to forge a lasting alliance between the Sobaipuris and the
Spaniards (Bolton 1919 I:184).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino made a third sweep through Sobaipuri country
during the winter of 1696-97. This time he traveled down the San Pedro
first, baptizing the young son of El Coro. Then he veered west and
visited the Sobaipuris of San Xavier del Bac, "where I was received with
all love by the many inhabitants of the great rancher&iacute;a, and by
many other principal men, who had gathered from various parts
adjacent."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino returned to San Pablo de Quiburi in March 1697,
but his largest expedition to the Sobaipuris began in November of that
year. He and his frequent traveling companion, Juan Mateo Manje, left
Dolores and rendezvoused with Captain Cristobal Martin Bernal and
twenty-five soldiers from the presidio of Fronteras at Quiburi. "We
found the Pima natives of Quiburi very jovial and very friendly," Kino
observed. "They were dancing over scalps and spoils of fifteen enemies,
Hocomes and Janos, whom they had killed a few days before. This was so
pleasing to us that the Se&ntilde;or Captain Christobal Martin Bernal,
the Se&ntilde;or alf&eacute;rez, the sergeant, and many others, entered
the circle and danced merrily with the natives" (Bolton 1919 I:168-69).
The victory dance reassured Bernal that the Sobaipuris were not in
league with the Jocome, Janos, Suma, Manso, and Apache raiders who were
running off livestock from the communities of northern Sonora and Nueva
Vizcaya.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The expedition continued down the San Pedro River,
passing through a depopulated stretch of the floodplain that extended
for sixty miles north of Quiburi. The Jesuit and his companions entered
villages under the leadership of Humari, who had been at war with Coro
until Kino made peace between the two O'odham leaders. Once it reached
the junction of the San Pedro and Gila rivers, the expedition followed
the Gila as it curves northwest along the Tortilla Mountains and then
heads south across the desert flats where the cotton fields of Florence
and Coolidge now spread under the sun. Their destination was the great
ruin of Casa Grande, where they admired the high, thick walls and
"marveled" at the "great aqueduct" of the Hohokam that once irrigated
thousands of acres of cultivated land. Kino noted "six or seven
rancher&iacute;as of Pimas Sobaipuris" nearby, "all of whom in all
places received us very kindly, with crosses and arches erected and with
many of their eatables, and with great pleasure to themselves, gave us
many little ones to baptize" (Bolton 1919 I:172).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kino's brief entries draw no explicit distinction
between the O'odham of the Upper Santa Cruz Valley and the Sobaipuris to
the north. Describing his second expedition northward in late summer
1692, however, he wrote, "I went in, with fifty pack-animals, my
servants, and some justices, to the Sobaipuris, both of the north and
the northeast. The latter are in the valleys of the river of Quiburi, to
the east, and the former are in the valley and river of Santa
Mar&iacute;a, to the west" (Bolton 1919 I:122). That statement suggests
that Kino considered both groups Sobaipuris.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In September 1698, on the other hand, Kino was
ordered to follow the "R&iacute;o Grande"&#151;the Gila River&#151;until
it reached the "Sea of California." His "Relaci&oacute;n Diaria" of the
expedition, translated by Fay Jackson Smith, contains a passage open to
another interpretation. Kino, Captain Diego Carrasco, and their O'odham
companions pass through San Luis de Baconacos, Guevavi, and San Cayetano
(Tumac&aacute;cori). After leaving Tumac&aacute;cori, Kino wrote, "At
sunset we traveled on another three leagues to sleep in a place from
where on the following day we could reach more easily the Sobaipuris and
their first great rancher&iacute;a, San Francisco Xavier del Bac" (Smith
et al 1966:13). This passage suggests a possible distinction between the
Pimas of the upper Santa Cruz Valley and the Sobapipuris of the Tucson
Basin.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Manje, a much better journal keeper than Kino, left
two accounts of their 1697 expedition to the "pimas sabah&iacute;puris"
(Burrus 1971:358). One forms part of Manje's famous <I>Luz de tierra
inc&oacute;gnita.</I> Jesuit historian Ernest Burrus published a second,
more complete account in its original Spanish in 1971. Kino and Manje
arrived in San L&aacute;zaro at the bend of the Santa Cruz on November
5, where Manje counted seventy people and "more than twenty houses"
scattered a short distance from one another. It was a beautiful spot,
"adorned with many cottonwoods, pretty meadows to support livestock, and
fertile fields, all under irrigation" (my translation from Burrus
1971:358). The two men continued on to Santa Mar&iacute;a, where Manje
counted 200 O'odham and commented favorably about the agricultural
fertility of the valley and the abundant grasslands surrounding it. He
also noted that the inhabitants of Santa Mar&iacute;a wore clothing of
cotton and animal skins <I>(gamuzas).</I> In neither of his two accounts
did Manje refer to the inhabitants of these two communities on the Upper
Santa Cruz by any specific term.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In his first account, Manje described Coro as the
"chief Indian of the Pima nation" (my translation from Burrus 1971:336).
In his second account, he noted that the two "Hocome" boys captured by
O'odham in the village of Jiaspi on the San Pedro had been taken by the
"sobah&iacute;puris de San Xavier del Vac" (Burrus 1971:363). When the
expedition reached Oj&iacute;o, the rancher&iacute;a of Humari, Manje
described the O'odham leader as "the Indian with the greatest following
among all this nation of the Sobah&iacute;puris" (my translation from
Burrus 1971:366). Finally, in his epilogue to the second account, Manje
referred to the Indians of Quiburi, Bac, and Casa Grande as
"sobah&iacute;puris." The Indians of San Cayetano de Tumag&aacute;curi
(Tumac&aacute;cori) and San Gabriel de Guevavi, in contrast, were not
given a specific ethnic designation.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Based upon this ambiguous documentary evidence, it is
difficult to determine how strong an ethnic boundary existed between the
Sobaipuris and Bolton's "Pimas proper" at the end of the seventeenth
century. O'odham seemed to have been able to move freely between the
Upper Santa Cruz Valley and the Tucson Basin. The Sobaipuris of Bac also
traveled thirty leagues to the lower San Pedro to join Sobaipuris under
Humari in their battle against the Jocomes. [<A
HREF="chap2n.htm#5">5</A>] The documentary record provides evidence of
hostility between Sobaipuris on the San Pedro under Coro and Humari but
not between the Sobaipuris of Bac and their neighbors to the south. The
ethnic boundary between the O'odham of Tumac&aacute;cori and Guevavi and
the Sobaipuris to the north and northeast did not seem to be as strong
as the Late Classic cultural boundary that separated the inhabitants of
Palo Parado and other sites in the Upper Santa Cruz Valley from those
living in the platform-mound communities in the Tucson Basin or the
lower San Pedro Valley.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A mosaic begins to emerge as these bits and pieces of
documentary and archaeological evidence are fitted together.
Southeastern Arizona at the end of the seventeenth century was a dynamic
frontier, just as it had been in the Late Classic. The Sobaipuris may
have been descendants of the O'odham who helped overthrow elites
governing platform-mound communities along the Gila. O'odham in the
Upper Santa Cruz Valley may have moved northward in their wake. If Shaul
and Hill's linguistic scenario is correct, Tepimans migrated southward
as Classic Hohokam society flourished. Some of those Tepimans may have
reversed direction as Late Classic Hohokam society decayed.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Two additional factors intensified the fluidity of
O'odham society at European contact: 1) pressure from nomadic raiders to
the north and east, and 2) the devastation of Old World epidemic
diseases. When Kino and Manje reached the rancher&iacute;a of Santa Cruz
de Jauanipicta, or Gaybanipitea, on the Baboc&oacute;mari River on
December 7, 1697, Sobaipuris were celebrating a victory over sixteen
Jocomes and Janos who had tried to run off their livestock. The
Sobaipuris had killed thirteen of the raiders and seriously wounded the
other three. Two days later, Kino and Manje found Sobaipuris in Coro's
village of Quiburi performing a circular dance around a tall pole
dangling nine scalps, three bows and arrows, and other paraphernalia
taken from the same raiders (Burrus 1971:360-61). The introduction of
Old World livestock had already made Sobaipuris along the San Pedro
targets of raids.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The ethnic identity of the raiders was fluid as well.
In Manje's second account of the 1697 expedition, the dead enemies were
Jocomes. His first account, on the other hand, states, "We also found
here [Jiaspi] the scalps of six enemy Apaches that they had killed a
little while ago, and two boy prisoners that Indians from the great
rancher&iacute;a of Bac had carried away. For that reason, the soldiers
disabused themselves of their opposition [to the Sobaipuris] and
[realized] they [the Sobaipuris] had no confederation with the enemy
Apaches" (my translation of Burrus 1971:338). Manje's apparent confusion
was understandable. He was providing a snapshot of the southeastern
Arizona frontier at a time when the Apaches were relentlessly moving
south and west, assimilating or displacing the Jocomes and other poorly
understood groups like the Janos, Mansos, and Sumas (Sheridan in
press).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There were no such discrepancies in his account when
he and Kino traveled along the Gila. The area to the north and east was
clearly identified as Apache territory. By the late 1600s, Apache groups
dominated the mountains along the Gila, including the northern slopes of
the Pinale&ntilde;o Mountains (Sierra Florida). The Apaches shared the
Chiricahua and other southeastern ranges with the Jocomes, Janos, Sumas,
Chinarras, and Mansos. By the early 1700s, however, these groups
disappeared from the Spanish documentary record, at least in
southeastern Arizona. For the rest of the colonial period and beyond,
the Apaches controlled the sky islands and grassland basins east of the
San Pedro River (Sheridan in press).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Not long after Kino and Manje's expedition,
hostilities between the Sobaipuris and their Janos, Jocome, Suma, Manso,
and Apache enemies intensified. On February 25, 1698, those enemies
sacked the mission of Coc&oacute;spera to the south. A month later, on
March 30, a combined force of Jocomes, Sumas, Mansos, and Apaches,
estimated to number about 600 by Kino, assaulted Gaybanipitea. When Coro
heard of the attack, he hurried to the rescue. The enemy leader, El
Capotcari, proposed a showdown between ten of Coro's bravest fighters
and ten of his own, six of whom were Apaches. The Sobaipuris routed
their ten adversaries and pursued the rest of the attackers, killing
many of them.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">After the attack, however, Coro and his people
retreated to Sonoita Creek near Patagonia. Such movement may have been
common among the O'odham of the San Pedro watershed. Archaeologist Deni
Seymour (1989) contends that Sobaipuris along the San Pedro frequently
abandoned sites and shifted the location of their settlements. They also
came together into fewer but larger communities. Seymour recognizes that
Sobaipuri mobility may have been in response to attacks by Janos,
Jocomes, Sumas, and Apaches, but she also suggests "there is some
indication that the pattern of population movement was a characteristic
indigenous trait." According to Seymour (1989:220), "Archaeological
evidence in favor of this position includes the extremely low density of
artifacts, the lack of deep stratification, and the unsubstantial nature
of the architecture on all known Sobaipuri and Upper Piman sites
throughout southern Arizona."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">At present, there is somewhat of a disjunction
between the documentary and archaeological record. Manje enumerated
4,450 O'odham living in thirty rancher&iacute;as along the San Pedro,
Gila, and Santa Cruz rivers. He also described extensive Sobaipuri
fields of corn, beans, squash, and cotton irrigated by earthen acequias
(canals) along both the San Pedro and the Santa Cruz. As archaeologist
Bruce Masse (1981:46) points out, however, "Ground stone is weakly
represented at Sobaipuri village sites, as are domesticated plant
remains. The archaeological record suggests that agriculture played only
a minor role in Sobaipuri subsistence."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This disjunction may be more apparent than real. "A
question that has plagued archaeologists for years is: If so many
Classic period sites are known, where are the sites that date to the
16th and 17th centuries?" Doelle and Wallace (1990:256) observe. "Our
response is that the sites are there and they have gone unrecognized for
the most part." More archaeological survey and excavation focusing on
this so-called "protohistoric" period may bridge the Late Classic and
early mission eras.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">That bridge may turn out to be tumultuous and
pox-ridden. The Late Classic stratified regional system of the Hohokam
in the Phoenix Basin was disintegrating about the same time the trading
center of Paquim&eacute; (Casas Grandes) was collapsing in northwestern
Chihuahua. The resulting power vacuum sucked less sedentary peoples into
the region from all directions&#151;O'odham from the south and west,
Janos, Jocomes, Mansos, Sumas, and Chinarras from the east, Apaches from
the north&#151;before the Europeans arrived.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Silent invaders undoubtedly penetrated southern
Arizona as well&#151;smallpox scabs riding in raw cotton passed along
Indian trade routes, microbes of measles lurking in the mucus or saliva
of infected individuals fleeing Spanish northward expansion. The
populations of North and South America never experienced the ravages of
Old World contagious diseases&#151;smallpox, measles, influenza, typhus,
malaria&#151;until 1518, when a pox-ridden soldier from the
Narv&aacute;ez expedition landed on the Gulf coast of Mexico in pursuit
of Cort&eacute;s. His arrival triggered a terrible pandemic that
devastated the densely populated empires of Mesoamerica. Anthropologists
Henry Dobyns (1983) and Steadman Upham 1986) believe this pandemic may
have reached the Southwest as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Anthropologist Daniel Reff (1991) takes issue with
Dobyns and Upham, pointing out that the lowlands of Nayarit and Sinaloa
were still densely populated when Nu&ntilde;o de Guzm&aacute;n raped and
pillaged his way north along the Pacific coast of Mexico in 1530 and
1531. Reff believes that epidemics of Old World diseases did not arrive
in Sonora or Arizona until sometime after 1539, when Fray Marcos de Niza
described large populations in the region. Nonetheless, Reff agrees with
Dobyns that Old World diseases may have contributed to the collapse of
the Hohokam sometime in the mid-16th century.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Most archaeologists disagree, contending that dates
for the abandonment of platform-mound communities in the Phoenix and
Tonto basins cluster in the 1300s and 1400s, not the 1500s. But it is
hard to believe that the O'odham did not suffer from other pandemics
eating away at the flesh and fabric of other Southwestern societies in
the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The impermanence of
O'odham settlements may have been an adaptation to frontier conditions.
But when Europeans like Kino and Manje first entered southern Arizona,
the Pimer&iacute;a Alta must have been a disease frontier as well as a
political frontier. The Sobaipuris and other O'odham may have moved
frequently to flee the "wandering sicknesses" from the south, burning
their simple brush dwellings <I>(kis)</I> to destroy the contagions that
had ravaged their neighbors and kin (Bahr et al 1974; Dobyns 1959. [<A
