Maxima's optical system consists of 3 mirrors. A primary, secondary and 
tertiary. See attached figure.
The optical system was designed during Sept./Oct. 1994 by Shaul
Hanany.   
<P>
Design Parameters: 
<UL>
<LI>	
Provide diffraction limited perfomance at a wavelength of 3 mm over 
a focal plane that consists of 8 pixels, each with a 20 arcminute
FWHM beam. 
</UL>
Constraints 
<UL>
<LI>	
The primary mirror existed before the detailed design of the system.
<LI>	
The size of the post primary optics had to be reasonably compact - to reduce 
optical loading on the detectors it was desirable to cool the post primary 
   mirror optics. 
</UL>
<P>
Resulting system
The resulting system is an f/1.8 three mirror system. The exact parameters 
of the mirrors can be found in the  <A HREF="MAXIMA_optics.html">
MAXIMA OPTICS  binder. </A>
The system meets all the design parameters as outlined above. Detailed performance
information can be found in the <A HREF="MAXIMA_optics.html">

Mirrors and optics box: 
<UL>
<LI>	
The primary mirror is made of ....??
it weighs 11 Kg. its emissivity was measured to be ....??
It was purchased from Dornier, Germany for $125,000.
<LI>	
The secondary and tertiary mirrors are made of light-weighted 6061-T6 Al 
covered with SiO2 protective coating. They were diamond spinned by 
Speedring Systems in Michigan. 
<LI>	
the optics box was designed by Paul Richards, and Shaul Hanany, with 
assistance by Speedring. It was layed out by Speedring and fabricated 
by the machine shop in Berkeley. After the parts were machined the parts
were heat treated by Speedring, the box was assembled with the optics, and 
the system was test (by Speedring). Results of the tests are the in the
