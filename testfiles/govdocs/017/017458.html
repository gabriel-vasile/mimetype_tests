Documentation for the MAXIMA Cryostat:
<P>
Maxima's cryostat is a LHe cooled cryostat with a LN2 stage. 
It was purchased from IR labs for about $30,000 in 1995. 
It arrived in Berkeley in July, 1995. 
The cryostat was designed by Shaul Hanany, and Paul Richards with contributions
from the rest of the MAX team. 
<P>
The liquid He tank has a volume of about 21.1 liters and the LN2 tank 
has a volume of 12.1 liters. 
The projected LHe hold time is about 30 hours. 
<P>
The cryostat was designed to accomodate an array of 8 PHOTOMETERS of the type
that were flown on MAX-4 and MAX-5. The cold plate have re-entrant inserts 
into the LHe volume designed for an <A HREF="adr.html"> ADR </A> and 
<A HREF="helium3.html"> He3 FRIDGE. </A> 
The He3 fridge is an intercept stage between the ADR and 
the LHe stage. 
A mechanical heat switch is provided with the cryostat for a quick 
cool down of the
the photometers and ADR to LHe temperatures (from 300K). Two electrical 
heat switches control the switching between the ADR/photometers to the He3 
stage, and between the ADR/photometers to the LHe stage. 
<P> 
The LHe stage also accomodates the optics box which consists of the secondary
and tertiary mirrors (see <A HREF="optics.html">
OPTICS </A> ).
