      <h3>Effluent Guidelines Task Force Meeting Summary</h3>
      <strong> January 25-26, 2000<br />
  Washington, DC</strong> 
      <p>United States Environmental Protection Agency<br />
        Effluent Guidelines Task Force<br />
  January 25-26, 2000 Meeting</p> 
      <p> <strong> Tuesday, January 25, 2000</strong> </p>
      <h4>I. Welcome</h4>
      Margaret Nellor, Sanitation District of Los Angeles County, Task Force Chair 
      Sheila Frace, Director, Engineering and Analysis Division, Office of Science 
      and Technology, U.S. EPA 
      <p> The meeting began at 9:30 a.m. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor opened the meeting by welcoming participants and setting 
        out the day's agenda. II. Review of Task Force Recommendations Sheila 
        Frace, Director, EAD Ms. Frace reviewed the status of EPA's response to 
        the Task Force recommendations. In the early years of the Task Force (1992 
        - 1997), four reports were completed, voted out, and forwarded to the 
        National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy &amp; Technology (NACEPT) 
        for approval. Subsequent to that, several workgroups developed reports 
        which had not yet been submitted to NACEPT; 1) &quot;Pretreatment Pass-through 
        Workgroup Report&quot;, which went through an alternative methodology for determining 
        pass-through; 2) &quot;Co-Regulation and Multimedia Permitting Report&quot;, which 
        included recommendations on developing a master schedule for rulemaking 
        and encouraging State- level multimedia permitting. There were a number 
        of additional recommendations that were voted out and were not consolidated 
        into a report, and these are included in the document handed out today 
        entitled &quot;Recommendations For Streamlining the Effluent Guidelines Development 
        Process.&quot; Ms. Frace asked the Task Force to review this report.</p> 
      <p> Ms. Frace explained that EPA assessed the key goals of the Task Force 
        and the actual effect on the guidelines program. The first key area is 
        expediting the effluent guidelines development process. This has been 
        a topic of numerous workgroups and reports of the Task Force; the first 
        one &quot;Removing the Bottlenecks from the Regulatory Development Process&quot; 
        featured consolidated recommendations from the Task Force during the past 
        two years. Most of the recommendations focused on data collection, which 
        were identified as being one of the longest, most consuming aspects of 
        the effluent guidelines process. Recommendations included better use of 
        electronic information systems, better use of electronic questionnaires, 
        and improved stakeholder outreach. The Engineering and Analysis Division 
        (EAD) tried to implement many of these recommendations, which include 
        the regulation development for coal mining, animal feeding operations, 
        and the synthetic drilling fluids. EAD is changing the process now for 
        future guidelines that may require a questionnaire, where there are no 
        existing extensive databases by issuing a new survey contract. This contract 
        will involve people who have extensive experience with electronically 
        transmitted questionnaires, and have more expertise in meshing databases 
        that will result from those questionnaires. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace further explained that considering the regulations that were 
        started since the first recommendations came out of the Task Force, EAD 
        has managed to decrease the average time from start of the project to 
        signature of the proposal to 30 months. In the past, the process flow 
        chart calls for 60 months from start to signature of the proposal. This 
        is a very significant improvement. EAD recently met with staff in the 
        Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) to better assess 
        their current schedules. As a general rule, targeting a 36-month window 
        from start of work to signature of the proposal is a comparable level 
        to EAD. </p>
      <p> However, not every guideline development can be achieved in 30 months, 
        or even 36 months. One example is Iron and Steel, which when signed in 
        October 2000, will have taken 48 months from our official start. This 
        is an example of a regulation where it was necessary to do a questionnaire 
        and initiate it before we had some of the additional contract support. </p>
      <p> Mike Peters asked Ms. Frace to define &quot;start of the project.&quot; Ms. Frace 
        explained that the start of a project is when senior management, internal 
        to the Agency (AA level) selects a regulatory project for development, 
        a team is assigned, and contract resources are made available. The way 
        in which the Consent Decree is formatted, the deadline has been the end 
        of the calendar year. There is no official notice in the Federal Register. 
        EPA notifies the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the industry 
        shortly after the decision is made and a team is assigned. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace continued her discussion by stating that another key goal 
        of the Task Force's accomplishments is relevant to the content of the 
        effluent guidelines. Considering the history of the Task Force, there 
        have been a lot of activities focusing on regulations from a multi-media 
        standpoint. Many of these activities concerned pollution prevention. There 
        has been more focus on alternative technologies that might not necessarily 
        be mainstream, but might be appropriate for at least a segment of the 
        industry. Two examples include: pulp and paper effluent guidelines, which 
        included a provision called &quot;voluntary advanced technology incentives 
        program (VATIP).&quot; This regulation established base-line effluent quality 
        (BEQ) that would apply automatically to everyone across the board, provided 
        they did not opt into this VATIP. The level for BEQ was established based 
        on the Agency's criteria of what is considered best available technology 
        economically achievable (BAT). The Agency acknowledged that there were 
        available technologies that could produce better results but would cost 
        an extra billion dollars in capital expenditures, and would have a significant 
        financial impact. </p>
      <p> In recognition that this technology was available, EPA instituted an 
        approach that was very similar to the pollution prevention options that 
        resulted from the multi-media pollution prevention report. The VATIP established 
        three tiers of more stringent limitations; 1) if commitment is made within 
        the first year of a permit cycle to the first tier of more stringent limitations, 
        you would get 5 years to comply; 2) similarly, if commitment was made 
        to the second tier, you would get 10 years to comply; and 3) if you agreed 
        to the third tier, you would get 15 years to comply. </p>
      <p> Second, with the Pesticides Formulators, Packagers and Repackagers (PFPR) 
        effluent guidelines, the approach was somewhat different. EPA proposed 
        a zero discharge standard based on the ability of the industry to recycle 
        and reuse the wastewaters from the processing. Most of it was rinsewaters 
        from tanks, where the pesticide was formulated for bottling or distribution. 
        Most of the facilities were able to comply by storing rinsewaters, reusing 
        them in a future formulation of the same or similar product, or through 
        actual application - using the wastewaters as a pesticide for application. 
        There were a number of facilities that had problems because recycle and 
        reuse options were not available. The Agency developed a pollution prevention 
        alternative to the zero discharge regulation which prescribes specific 
        circumstances in which a discharge would be allowed. The alternative specified 
        which wastewaters the discharge would be allowed for and the types of 
        technologies that would be considered acceptable treatment for those wastestreams. 
        These facilities are mostly indirect dischargers, therefore, the Agency 
        expended a lot of effort subsequent to promulgation of the regulation 
        to educate, not only the industry, but the publicly-owned treatment works 
        (POTWs) that were responsible for the implementation. </p>
      <p> The Task Force recommendations have made many differences. For example, 
        in developing the original Metal Products &amp; Machinery (MP&amp;M) Phase I proposal, 
        EAD had a bibliography that was very significant; EAD looked at alternative 
        technologies that will not only impact the water but the air relative 
        to the animal feeding operations arena and the iron and steel operations. 
        The third area where these recommendations have made a big impact is the 
        process of selecting industries for which we will do a preliminary study.</p> 
      <p> Ms. Frace also discussed the Task Force's outreach efforts which has 
        made great progress in the last 10 years. We are learning a lot from the 
        small business process, relative to obtaining comments before proposal. 
        This type of communication has improved our timing of projects. For example, 
        in sharing information with small entities in the MP&amp;M effluent guidelines 
        project, we provided information from some of our early costing runs that 
        showed an inordinate percentage of the industry going to zero discharge, 
        based on the cost of implementing even our least stringent option. We 
        were able to revise our estimates based on early input. Another issue 
        is using other data sources. EAD has been successful in using information 
        from the Office of Surface Mining and the States with regard to coal mining; 
        with the animal feeding operations, our data is from US Department of 
        Agriculture. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace was asked whether or not EPA could publicize obtaining more 
        relevant data from outside entities. Ms. Frace responded that the data 
        will come from the industry, or from someone who has the authority to 
        go on site and do the sampling, (the POTWs or the State). Unfortunately, 
        the State resources are such that we have not had any States come forward 
        with interest in helping to do the sampling. </p>
      <p> A suggestion was made to use electronic media more and noted that the 
        Web page for effluent guidelines has not been updated since April 1999. 
        The status of the Task Force and case studies could be made available 
        on the Web page. Ms. Frace agreed. </p>
      <p> Mr. Gilliam asked about the status of other activities, such as hospital 
        sterilizers, mercury-cell chloralkali plants, and painting and stripping 
        operations. Ms. Frace responded that there has been a series of meetings, 
        including discussions on animal feeding operations, chloralkali plants, 
        and POTWs. Some of these discussions were convened as a result of the 
        OAQPS' urban toxics initiative to determine where the Air Office should 
        direct their resources. We are not looking at POTWs. Currently, there 
        are regulations underway in the Air Office to deal with mercury-cell chloralkali 
        facilities. There are about 14 chloralkali plants in the country that 
        still use the old mercury-cell technology. We do have effluent guidelines 
        that cover chloralkali production. There has been discussion of whether 
        we should update those standards and establish limits that would push 
        industry away from the older technologies. However, there are significant 
        cost repercussions, and there are Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) 
        implications of closing out some old facilities in terms of what to do 
        with the materials. Therefore, we are coordinating these discussions to 
        determine all the implications. </p>
      <p> After a lengthy discussion about the &quot;Recommendations&quot; report, Ms. Frace 
        requested the members review it and submit suggestions so that it can 
        be revised and put on the Website. The deadline for submission of comments 
        is February 26, 2000. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace was asked the purpose of this report and she replied that 
        it would be used relative to the consent decree charge, what has been 
        accomplished, and what needs to be accomplished. Ms. Nellor added that 
        these recommendations will help set up measures to assure the timing of 
        regulation development does not slip in the wrong direction. A discussion 
        followed about the development of a standard operating procedure for conducting 
        an effluent guideline. Ms. Frace indicated that Jim Lund (EAD) will update 
        the guidance document for new employees. There will also be a new round 
        of brown-bag lunches on this subject and other OW issues. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor summarized that the Recommendations of the Task Force would 
        be put to final form on the Website, and the Task Force members should 
        send comments to Sheila by February 26. This report will go to NACEPT 
        as a report-back. </p>
      <h4> III. Best Management Practices<br />
  Ron Jordan, U.S. EPA, OST/EAD</h4>
      <p>Ron Jordan's presentation entitled: &quot;Best Management Practices in Effluent 
      Guidelines.&quot; Mr. Jordan began his discussion by explaining that in the older 
      guidelines, there might be some type of aspect that is called a BMP. Examples 
      include the type of BMPs being incorporated in guidelines at this time. 
      1) Pulp and Paper regulations were published in April 1998 and has phased 
      implementation for BMPs. April 1999 was the first deadline that some facilities 
      might have had to deal with implementing BMPs, depending on discharge status; 
      2) Pesticide Formulating Packaging and Repackaging effluent guidelines had 
      a requirement that sets the discharge, but there was also specific management 
      practices and specific requirements for record keeping and reporting; 3) 
      Animal Feeding Operations regulations will rely on BMP for at least a significant 
      part of the regulation. These rules are scheduled for proposal in December 
      2000 and cover four major animal sectors. Other industries which will rely 
      on BMPs include coal mining, and construction and development effluent guideline. </p>
      <p> Mr. Jordan stated that this is a good time for EPA to evaluate the effectiveness 
        of the BMP approach. He presented a list of reasons why EPA considered 
        using BMPs in effluent guidelines including: (1) it is either infeasible, 
        or certainly very difficult, to set a numerical limit, (2) the effluent 
        limit approach may be inadequate; (3) increased flexibility for industry; 
        and (4) more pollution prevention opportunities. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace offered the example of PFPR, where EPA established a limit, 
        in this case, zero discharge, but also provided an alternative to avoid 
        multi-media impacts in certain instances. That did give industry some 
        flexibility. Mr. Jordan added that it helps to do the preventive measure 
        and impose some BMPs that prevent failures, such as lagoon ruptures from 
        occurring. </p>
      <p> Mr. Jordan continued with a detailed summary of the BMPs for Pulp and 
        Paper, and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) rules. </p>
      <p> <strong>Pulp &amp; Paper</strong> </p>
      <p> Goal: Minimize spills and other losses of pulping liquor, turpentine,

      <h4> IV. Strategy for New Industries and New Categories<br />
  Wendy Smith, U.S. EPA, OST/EAD</h4>
      <p>Ms. Smith remarked that at the last EGTF meeting, EAD was in the process 
      of selecting two industries for regulation, according to the consent decree, 
      by December 1999. At that meeting new data sources were presented that were 
      being incorporated into the process of selection, including &quot;toxic&quot; release 
      inventory (TRI)&quot; program. We have since made some changes to the selection 
      process. Some of the revisions to the selection process were greatly influenced 
      by the recommendations of the Task Force. The focus has been on multi-media 
      rulemaking and better use of the environmental data. Our process involved 
      consultations with other offices that were doing multi-media rulemakings, 
      looking at the TRI database, and getting information on the 305(b) database 
      about impaired water bodies. We also continued discussions with Office of 
      Water staff, the Permits program, Compliance and State representatives concerning 
      the potential disconnect between our effluent guidelines and the States' 
      concerns. We contacted the Regions, States, and local governments, receiving 
      comments on the 304(m) plan, interacting with the environmental groups, 
      and looking at the studies that were initiated in our office. After looking 
      at this information, we developed a list of sixty one categories (handout 
      entitled: &quot;Industries Under Consideration for Effluent Guideline Selection&quot;). 
      Ms. Smith indicated that some of the categories are already covered because 
      they have already been promulgated, or are in the process of being promulgated, 
      and there are regulations that are currently being developed, such as CAFOs, 
      MP&amp;M and Iron and Steel. These categories were removed when we looked at 
      the remainder of the list. Unfortunately, EAD did not find categories that 
      overlapped all these criteria. In looking at the TRI database, which reports 
      &quot;toxics&quot; and the 305(b) database (reports water quality impairments), there 
      are different pollutants, problems, and concerns. Also, in talking to our 
      outreach people, they often had a very site-specific concern that was unrelated 
      to other concerns. </p>
      <p> Ms. Smith continued that the categories were ranked in terms of what 
        was most important, such as the discharges of TRI, and the sources of 
        impaired water bodies. The major concern of the States and Regions was 
        nutrients, siltation, and pathogens. As a result, the list was narrowed 
        to eight categories with the addition of two more from unresolved issues 
        from other rulemakings. After briefing management, three categories were 
        selected. The first category, meat processing, is a big industry which 
        includes red meat and poultry. There are guidelines but no regulations 
        for nutrients ever promulgated, and there are no regulations for the poultry 
        sector. There is great interest in the Del Marva Peninsula for these categories. 
        EAD received comments that there would be some facilities that would switch 
        from the containers covered by the Transportation Equipment Cleaning (TEC) 
        rules to industrial containers not covered by the TEC rules. The last 
        category selected was the aquaculture industry, which is growing very 
        fast. Again, with this industry, there was a guidance document, but no 
        regulations for this industry. </p>
      <p> Ms. Smith was asked why aquaculture was selected when it was not included 
        in the ten &quot;finalists&quot;. She explained that the aquaculture category came 
        up at a briefing for the Assistant Administrator for Water, who was very 
        interested in this category and its impact on the Chesapeake Bay. She 
        added that aquaculture was mentioned often by outside sources, but was 
        not as prevalent as meat processing and POTWs. However, management was 
        very concerned about the aquaculture nutrient issue so it became a priority. 
        Also, it is unclear if EPA can legally regulate POTWs under an effluent 
        guideline. She stated that EAD wants to solicit comment in the Federal 
        Register, relative to possible industry selection to make these notices 
        more helpful. In the past, we have listed the categories that are among 
        the top selections. Very rarely do we receive valuable comments that look 
        at the information that has been provided through preliminary studies. 
        As a result, the usefulness of the notice is difficult to assess. </p>
      <p> Ms. Sundstrom commented that the 304(m) notice serves some functions 
        for the public. It may not serve a lot of functions for EAD, but for the 
        public, it does serve a function and the basic approaches EAD has used 
        does not need to be changed. </p>
      <h4> V. Update - Effluent Guidelines Program<br />
  Sheila Frace, Director, Engineering &amp; Analysis Division</h4>
      Ms. Frace stated that since the last Task Force meeting, EAD has had a few 
      major accomplishments. Two final rules were signed by the Administrator 
      on November 30, 1999, Landfills and the Hazardous Waste Combustor rules. 
      The other major accomplishment was the completion of the De-icing study 
      which will be on the web soon. Also, EAD convened two small business panels 
      under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act (SBREFA) 
      for Metal Products &amp; Machinery and for CAFOs. 
      <p> Ms. Frace was asked if EAD got a good cross section for the MP&amp;M SBREFA 
        panel. She responded yes, in terms of the small entity representatives 
        that advised the panel. We realized that CAFO is probably the largest 
        rule that we have ever attempted, and due to the different animal sectors 
        and trying to get multiple representatives of each animal type, we probably 
        have more than 25 or 30 small entity representatives. For MP&amp;M, there 
        are probably between 12-20 representatives for each category. </p>
      <h4> VI. Approval of Meeting Summary<br />
  Margaret Nellor, Sanitation District of Los Angeles County</h4>
      <p>Ms. Nellor thanked the participants for their presentations and asked the 
      Task Force members to approve the minutes. She asked if there was anything 
      in the summary that needed to be revised or changed. Ms. Sundstrom asked 
      about the section at the end on 'multimedia sector planning', which discusses 
      various things that could be coordinated with natural and various other 
      factors in a graded urban strategy, etc. Is this section only relevant when 
      effluent guidelines are being developed by EAD, or are there multimedia 
      coordination opportunities that were discussed? Ms. Frace responded that 
      the basic approach looked at something that all offices were interested 
      in doing. It was at least a two-fold effort. There are ongoing activities 
      where two offices are working on the same sector, but on different schedules. 
      There is another level where a category is the highest priority for each 
      office. The reality is that every office has long lists of different priorities 
      and our goal is to maximize these priorities. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor asked if there were any other changes to be made to the summary 
        other than the one correction requested by Allen Gilliam about paint stripping 
        operations. A member stated that in the second paragraph of the 'Fish 
        Tissue Survey' presentation where the sentence reads: &quot;risk in fish tissue 
        designed to expand the scope&quot;, may be missing a word. It should read: 
        &quot;The Office of Water has initiated work on a new study of chemical residues 
        in fish tissue. The new study is designed to expand the scope of the 1987-89 
        study.&quot; </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor noted that the Task Force approved the September 1999 minutes. </p>
      <p><strong> Wednesday, January 26, 2000</strong> </p>
      <h4> VII. Stakeholder Involvement Discussion of Recommendations<br />
  Glenn Shaul, USEPA-Cincinnati</h4>
      <p>Mr. Shaul presented Stakeholder Involvement Workgroup recommendations (&quot;White 
      Paper - Effluent Guidelines Task Force Work Group 1: Stakeholder's Involvement&quot;). 
      The two basic issues addressed by the workgroup were: (1) How stakeholder 
      involvement can be increased, and (2) Should stakeholders be paid to participate, 
      if they cannot afford to do so and, if so, how should they be paid? Mr. 
      Shaul stated that for the first issue, an interactive communication plan 
      was developed and approved by the workgroup. Information will be disseminated 
      as widely as possible, and the workgroup identified possible dissemination 
      vehicles. On the second issue, Mr. Shaul said that the workgroup was not 
      able to reach consensus on the appropriate model (among four possible models); 
      however, there was consensus in the workgroup that an affected stakeholder 
      should not be excluded from involvement because of economics. The workgroup 
      decided to let the Task Force decide this issue. </p>
      <p> An open discussion followed. Mr. Shaul was asked at what stage of the 
        effluent guideline development process the workgroup envisioned stakeholder 
        involvement. He replied that this involvement related to all stages. Mr. 
        Neufeld raised a concern that by keeping everyone informed at every stage 
        of the process may hinder progress. Mr. Shaul responded that the workgroup 
        did consider this idea of proxies. A possible model was suggested to have 
        EPA represent everyone (i.e., the public interest at large) except the 
        regulated community. Maybe that model can be made to work. Nancy Stoner 
        (NRDC) said that is not an appropriate model because EPA is not capable 
        of doing that. </p>
      <p> A discussion focused on the basic goal of stakeholder involvement. Should 
        it be done so that EPA can say it was done or is the goal to get input? 
        If input is the goal, the view was expressed that EPA must involve all 
        the stakeholders and not adopt any shortcuts. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace asked how the workgroup defined a proxy. The workgroup responded 
        that they considered a proxy to be someone actually selected by the party 
        unable to participate. Hilary Inyang added that the workgroup also suggested 
        that proxies could monitor meetings later in the process to ensure that 
        positions taken by the stakeholder in earlier meetings are not forgotten. 
        This use of proxies could, for the stakeholders, ensure oversight of the 
        process without the cost of continual direct participation. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor asked if the workgroup considered recommending a menu of 
        options for EPA to choose from. Mr. Shaul said that the workgroup's initial 
        intent was to have the Task Force make a definite recommendation to EPA, 
        not to present a menu of options. Mr. Shaul suggested that the issue of 
        what stakeholder involvement model should be recommended to EPA should 
        be addressed in a conference call. </p>
      <p> Regarding the issue of funding participation, Fran Robertaccio explained 
        how the workgroup agreed that economics should not be allowed to exclude 
        participation of someone who wants to be involved, and that we need to 
        find ways to address this issue. Bernadette Berdes said that she believes 
        a particular funding model does not have to be selected. Instead, we need 
        to refine the method of communication and need to refine how we communicate 
        to different levels of participants. The funding will follow. </p>
      <p> Mr. Shaul clarified that, while the workgroup has recommended elements 
        of the communication plan, EPA is to write the plan. It was agreed that 
        having EPA develop the communication plan is a good idea, and that the 
        funding issue could be part of the communication plan. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor suggested that the workgroup revise the recommendation based 
        on today's discussion and poll the Task Force members by e-mail on the 
        February 25 for approval and/or comments. Mr. Shaul then suggested that 
        he, Margie, and Sheila have a conference call before then to decide how 
        to handle the procedure for this e-mail exercise. Mr. Shaul said that 
        the workgroup will have a conference call for its members on February 
        7, 1:00 EST. Mr. Shaul will schedule. </p>
      <h4> VIII. Vision of Effluent Guidelines Program - OST Priorities<br />
  Sheila Frace, Director, EAD</h4>
      <p>Ms. Frace stated that Geoff Grubbs (Director, OST) could not attend today's 
      meeting and continued to describe his background and his interests and concerns 
      regarding the effluent guidelines program. She noted his strong ethic that 
      we need to meet the commitments that we make. Also, she noted his interest 
      that we utilize the technologies that are out there. For example, we need 
      to improve our Internet usage -- making information more accessible and 
      targeting this information more accurately to various audiences. Ms. Frace 
      said that he saw the document summarizing all the Task Force's recommendations 
      and was impressed about its outcome. She stated that he has a strong commitment 
      to the effluent guidelines program and sees flexibility in the unique multi-disciplinary 
      nature of EAD, which supports the various geographical-based needs around 
      the country. She continued that Geoff is also very interested in making 
      better use of other resources through better coordination with other agencies 
      to deal with environmental issues which we all face. </p>
      <p> Mr. Shaul noted that the Office of Research and Development (ORD) has 
        had a strong collaborative role with EAD on effluent guidelines in the 
        past but that this is now diminishing as ORD is headed on a more scientific 
        track. Ms. Frace suggested that our new approach to guideline development 
        puts less emphasis on research in individual guidelines, but that EAD 
        still needs ORD's research on generic issues and long-term needs. She 
        concluded her description of Geoff's interests in communication and outreach. </p>
      <h4> IX. Task Force Charge and Discussion of Future Role of the Task Force<br />
  Sheila Frace, Director, EAD</h4>
      <p>Ms. Frace described the handout on the &quot;Future Role of the Effluent Guidelines 
      Task Force.&quot; She noted that (1) the Consent Decree is not specific about 
      the life span of the Task Force; (2) the clear focus of the Consent Decree 
      is on recommendations for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines; 
      and (3) according to the Consent Decree, EPA is to request recommendations 
      in specific areas of the effluent guidelines development process. She said 
      that her intent in this meeting is to go over each specific area individually 
      in order to have the Task Force discuss whether it has done as much as it 
      can or whether there is more to be done. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace then reviewed the Task Force reports produced over the years. 
        She gave an overview of some of the areas where EPA is successfully implementing 
        recommendations, resulting in shortened time frames for recent guidelines. 
        Mr. Robertaccio asked if a revised flowchart of the effluent guidelines 
        development process is available highlighting current guidelines. Ms. 
        Frace replied that there is no new flowchart yet, and she described in 
        detail how the bottlenecks have been different for each of the recent 
        guidelines. She added that there is a modified process for which a new 
        flowchart could be drawn. Since there are no longer any global bottlenecks, 
        there is no single opportunity to improve this new process. A question 
        was raised about litigation, and Ms. Frace gave several examples relating 
        to the recent guidelines. </p>
      <p> Ms. Stoner said that the recommendations made by the Task Force as presented 
        in the Task Force Mission Report line up well with the Consent Decree. 
        Regarding the future role of the Task Force, she suggested working from 
        what the Task Force has already done. She suggested putting the Task Force 
        Mission Report on the Internet, selecting the biggest categories of recommendations, 
        and having EPA report quarterly on further progress in implementing the 
        major categories of recommendations. These quarterly reports would be 
        made available to the Task Force members and to everyone through the Internet. 
        She recommended annual meetings of the Task Force to discuss whether EPA 
        is implementing the recommendations as intended and whether there is a 
        need for more recommendations. The annual meetings could also serve to 
        find out whether EPA has any additional requests for recommendations. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace noted that these reports would be long, time-consuming to 
        prepare, and probably daunting to the reader because of their length if 
        they covered all the Task Force's recommendations. She pointed out that 
        the Task Force Mission Report was deliberately written to present a concise 
        picture (and therefore necessarily left some things out) rather than a 
        comprehensive picture. This was done because of complaints that previous 
        reports were too long and therefore not read. Ms. Stoner replied that 
        she was suggesting that the quarterly reports cover only the Task Force's 
        major recommendation areas (e.g., pollution prevention). </p>
      <p> The view was expressed that what the Task Force has done over the years 
        does indeed seem to fulfill the consent decree. There was general agreement 
        on this among the Task Force members. Ron Neufeld suggested that the question 
        should not be &quot;whether the Task Force can do more&quot; because the answer 
        to that is that &quot;the Task Force can always do more.&quot; Instead, he suggested 
        that the question should be whether the Task Force has fulfilled the expectations 
        for which it was established. In his view, an oversight role until December 
        2003 would now make sense for the Task Force. Ms. Berdes stated that the 
        Task Force is not finished. She said that the Task Force can still contribute 
        much regarding communication and outreach. She also said more work is 
        needed on cross- regulation, co-regulation, and media transfer. The Task 
        Force could also help find ways of dealing with smaller POTWs and hauled 
        waste issues. Also, in her view, the Task Force can and should try to 
        do more on the subject of reviewing existing regulations. </p>
      <p> Mr. Shaul agreed that the Task Force should do more work on cross-media 
        and on reviewing existing regulations. He also thought that interviewing 
        EPA staff, as was done in the early days of the Task Force, was a valuable 
        effort, and that it might be a good time to repeat the exercise again 
        since the staff are now implementing the Task Force's recommendations. 
        Mr. Shaul added that he thought meeting a couple times a year would work 
        best in the future for the Task Force. </p>
      <p> Task Force members expressed the view that, while the ideas of future 
        work that have been suggested for the Task Force are good ideas, it is 
        questionable whether the Task Force should reinvent its charge to do these 
        valuable things. The question of diminishing returns as the Task Force 
        continues to work was also voiced. </p>
      <p> Mr. Peters said that he was not sure how to review old effluent guidelines 
        but that he saw value in doing a &quot;post mortem&quot; of the recent guidelines 
        (i.e., what affected what, as these guidelines were being developed). 
        Ms. Nellor asked how that was different from an oversight role. Mr. Peters 
        replied that an oversight role implied some value judgments, whereas the 
        &quot;post mortem&quot; he was suggesting is simply an objective fact-finding exercise. </p>
      <p> Mr. Robertaccio noted that, based on his earlier questions to Sheila 
        in this meeting, there seemed little left for the Task Force to accomplish. 
        Therefore, he suggested that the Task Force could address areas like coordination 
        with other agencies or looking at the content of effluent guidelines (e.g., 
        dealing with additives to foods and hormone additives, etc.). He said 
        that this effort could be global (i.e., not industry by industry) and 
        therefore would have broad impact on effluent guidelines. He also noted 
        that this would involve new technologies, and the consent decree specifically 
        mentions recommendations on new technologies. He concluded that the Task 
        Force could do this type of work in addition to fulfilling an oversight 
        role. </p>
      <p> The point was brought up that the oversight role could be like a corporate 
        board of directors. The Task Force would not get involved with details 
        but only concern itself with major issues. It was further suggested, however, 
        that this oversight role on only major matters is not compatible with 
        the role of continuing to address minor details. To do the latter would 
        require more than just annual meetings. Whereas the oversight role could 
        be done with only annual meetings. The view was expressed that conference 
        calls are not a satisfactory way of trying to do work. There is important 
        synergy gained by meeting face to face. Therefore, continuing to do work 
        on issues would require more than just one meeting per year. </p>
      <p> Lois Epstein suggested that the oversight role probably made the most 
        sense at this point. While more work should be done on cross-media regulations, 
        this work is not easy. She suggested some possible elements for oversight: 
        timing of regulatory steps, communication with stakeholders, pollution 
        prevention, multi-media regulations, category selection/justification. 
        With quarterly reports put on the Internet and provided to the Task Force, 
        a Task Force oversight role could be fulfilled with an annual meeting. 
        A view was expressed that, if there is only an annual meeting, the quarterly 
        reports are important to update the Task Force members between meetings. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace stated that, given the pace of effluent guidelines development, 
        not much changes from one quarter to the next. As a result, comprehensive 
        quarterly reports may not be that useful. However, if each report is focused 
        on a specific area and EPA is given discretion on selecting not only the 
        area of focus but also the timing of submitting the report, the reports 
        will probably be more useful. She continued, giving an example of this 
        for this coming year relating to the development of the Iron &amp; Steel regulation. </p>
      <p> The idea was posed that, if the report were to be a comprehensive report 
        (and not individually area-specific as Sheila suggested), it could have 
        a tabular format. And, if there is no change from one report to the next, 
        just indicate &quot;no change.&quot; </p>
      <p> Vincent Torres said that he believes that the Task Force has done good 
        work but that there is more work to be done. There are still some open-ended 
        issues that are not finished. That is not a negative observation, but 
        a positive one. Good work often uncovers needs for more work to be done, 
        and that is the case here. He went on to say that he believes the future 
        role of the Task Force should blend the oversight role with continuing 
        work on more issues. He suggested meeting three times per year, with e-mail 
        communication between meetings instead of teleconferencing. </p>
      <p> Mr. Inyang called attention to the consent decree's mention of new technologies. 
        He noted that, if the Task Force is to make recommendations on new technologies 
        (as the consent decree states), the evolving nature of technologies suggests 
        a continuing role for the Task Force. He also noted Geoff Grubbs's interest 
        in geographic-based factors. Mr. Inyang said that a move toward a more 
        geographic-based program is unavoidable and will require a group like 
        this existing Task Force. He also said that EPA's BMP approaches still 
        need more input from the Task Force. </p>
      <p> John Torgan suggested that the Task Force has fulfilled its mission, 
        and whether it should continue depends on EPA's needs. If the Task Force 
        were to have a continuing role, it could serve as a sounding board in 
        the future, and it could be available to EPA on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis. </p>
      <p> At this point Ms. Nellor said that she heard at least half the members 
        suggest that the Task Force continue to deal with some issues. However, 
        she stressed that unless you have the energy to make workgroups do the 
        work, it isn't going to happen. She suggested that, unless the energy 
        exists to continue to work on issues, the Task Force role of oversight 
        (and serving as a sounding board) is probably more realistic. </p>
      <p> Ms. Stoner suggested that the Task Force should do the oversight role 
        at least. Regarding doing more than oversight, she said that would depend 
        on what the &quot;more&quot; is and whether the Task Force is the best place to 
        do it. She said that, for example, Mr. Robertaccio's idea of going outside 
        the consent decree are very exciting, perhaps, those issues should be 
        dealt with elsewhere. She added that the Task Force's role on those issues 
        should be not to let them die and find where they should be addressed 
        and see that they get resolved. </p>
      <p> The example was brought up of revisiting existing regulations. The suggestion 
        was made that maybe EPA's information office knows best how to address 
        this issue. At this point, Ms. Nellor suggested (1) that oversight categories 
        be decided at the May meeting; (2) that the EPA reports be done at appropriate 
        times, rather than at regular quarterly intervals; and (3) that, if the 
        Task Force wants to continue to work on specific subjects, let her know 
        how and by whom this work is going to get done. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace said that, to avoid having the May meeting repeat the issues 
        of this meeting, there need to be two workgroups between now and May one 
        on the oversight concept and one on the open-ended issues. Both workgroups 
        will need to find time to communicate between now and May probably by 
        e-mail. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor then split the Task Force into two groups an &quot;oversight/post 
        mortem&quot; workgroup (Mike, Nancy, Allen, Ron, Lori, and Lois) and a &quot;continue 
        issues&quot; workgroup (Bernadette, Glenn, Fran, Vince, and Hilary). She said 
        she was not sure where Mr. Torgan best fit. Mr. Torgan replied that when 
        he looks at the charge in the consent decree and compares it to what the 
        Task Force has done, he believes that the Task Force has fulfilled its 
        task. Therefore, he best fits in the oversight group. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace mentioned that when a Task Force members' term expire, we 
        always have to decide whether to continue members or replace them. In 
        view of the prospect of the Task Force continuing to December 2003, Sheila 
        asked if EPA could begin work now on paperwork to extend current Task 
        Force members to 2003. Someone raised the question of why EPA needed to 
        do this now and whether it could wait. Sheila replied that it is a time-consuming 
        process involving Deputy Administrator approval, and therefore, it should 
        be started now. </p>
      <p> To summarize the workgroups, Margie suggested that the oversight workgroup 
        (Nancy, Allen, Ron, Lori, Lois, Mike, and John) should consider what &quot;oversight&quot; 
        should mean and what it should entail. She suggested that the open-ended 
        issues workgroup (Bernadette, Mr. Shaul, Fran, Vince, and Hilary) should 
        come up with what the Task Force should do and how they would do that 
        and how often that should occur in terms of meetings. Margie said that 
        both workgroups will need to select a Chair. Each workgroup's task will 
        be to flesh out its members' visions and ideas and come to the meeting 
        in May with recommendations for the Task Force as a whole to consider. 
        Also, EPA may want to include topics on the May agenda for the Task Force 
        to serve as a sounding board. Ms. Stoner volunteered to chair the oversight 
        workgroup. Ms. Frace agreed to call Mr. Torres and Ms. Berdes to discuss 
        who should chair the open-ended issues workgroup. </p>
      <p> Mr. Peters suggested the meeting minutes be provided to Task Force members 
        quicker than they have been provided in the past. He raised the question 
        of when members would receive the minutes of this meeting. Ms. Frace said 
        the meeting minutes would be provided in approximately one month. </p>
      <p> Ms. Nellor said that comments on the Task Force Mission Report should 
        be provided to EPA by February 25. Mr. Shaul's stakeholder involvement 
        group should have their conference call on February 7 and then decide 
        on appropriate voting procedures. The two new workgroups on the future 
        role of the Task Force should each get something to EPA by the end of 
        April for inclusion in the May meeting agenda package. Mr. Shaul asked 
        whether anyone specific, besides Geoff Grubbs, should be invited to the 
        May meeting. Ms. Frace replied that it might be good to have a member 
        of EPA's Workgroup on Coordinated Rulemaking, as well as Sally Shaver 
        (Division Director in OAQPS), attend the May meeting. </p>
      <p> Ms. Frace mentioned that five letters on CAFOs were sent to the Task 
        Force. She said the letters will be given to the CAFO team. She also said 
        that the senders of the letters will be told that there is a CAFO rulemaking 
        (in case they don't know) and they will be told what the appropriate mechanism 
        is for their comments. </p>
      <p> The meeting was adjourned at 12:30p.m. . </p>
