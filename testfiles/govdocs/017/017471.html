In this study,   74 pilots from two different airlines were studied before, during, and after   3- and 4-day commercial short-haul trips. All flights took place on the east   coast of the United States and occurred throughout the year. Of the pilots contacted   about the study, 85% agreed to participate. As a group, the pilots averaged   41.3 years of age and had, on average, 14.6 years of airline experience. Physiological   data (core body temperature and heart rate) and motor activity were obtained   every two minutes with the Vitalog portable biomedical monitor. Using the Pilot's   Daily Logbook, subjects provided subjective ratings of fatigue and mood every   two hours while awake, and recorded their sleep episodes and other activities   (e.g., meals, exercise, duty time). All subjects completed a background questionnaire   and a NASA cockpit observer accompanied crews during trip schedules. </font> </p><p> <p><font size="4"> The specific daytime and evening trips studied were selected   to provide information about the upper range of fatigue reported by pilots in   these operations. Common features of the trip schedules included early report   times and multiple flight legs (average 5.5/day) over long duty days. The trips   averaged 10.6 hrs of duty per day and involved an average of 4.5 hrs of flight   time. One-third of the duty periods studied were longer than 12 hours. The average   rest period was 12.5 hrs long and usually occurred progressively earlier in   the day across successive trip days. Data from the self-report daily logbook   demonstrated that during the trip nights, pilots took longer to fall asleep   (about 12 mins longer), slept less (about 1.2 hrs shorter), and awoke earlier   (about 1.4 hrs) compared to pre-trip sleep patterns. The pilots reported this   trip sleep as lighter and poorer (with more awakenings) compared to pre-trip   sleep. Subjective fatigue and mood were worse during layovers compared to levels   pre-trip, during flights, or post-trip. Significant time-of-day effects were   found for fatigue, negative emotions, and activation ratings. In the first three   ratings of the day, fatigue and negative emotion ratings were low following   awakening, and increased to reach their highest values in the final rating prior   to sleep. Predictably, activation ratings showed the inverse of this pattern.</font><p> <p><font size="4"> On trip days, pilots consumed more caffeine (average 3.4 servings)   compared to on pretrip days (average 1.9 servings) and on posttrip days (average   2.7 servings), presumably to maintain alertness during operations. These were   consumed primarily in the early morning associated with the earlier wakeup and   duty times and also, during the mid-afternoon peak in physiological sleepiness.   During the trip schedule more alcohol (average 1.6 servings) was consumed compared   to pre-trip (average 0.5 servings) and post-trip (average 1.0 servings) days.   The additional alcohol consumption can be assumed to have occurred after coming   off duty (presumably to "spin down" after a long duty day) and before sleep   (and within accordance of Federal Aviation Regulations). </font><p><font size="4"> This was one of the first field studies conducted by the NASA   program and provides a unique insight into the physiological and subjective   effects of flying short-haul commercial operations. It demonstrated that these   measures could be obtained in an operational environment without disturbing   regular performance of duties. The study results suggest several significant   operational considerations regarding fatigue. For example, the data showed that   the daily duty durations were double the flight durations and a third of the   duty periods were longer than 12 hours. The present Federal Aviation Regulations   (FARs) set specific pilot limits based on actual flight times. Findings from   this study suggest that limitations on duty time should be considered, just   as flight times are currently limited. Also, the practice of earlier duty times   on successive trip days, requiring earlier wakeup times, interferes with obtaining   adequate sleep. Even when the layovers were relatively long, the circadian system   would generally inhibit falling asleep earlier and hence the significant sleep   loss during trip nights. Therefore, when possible, duty times across successive   trip days should remain constant or begin progressively later (moving with the   natural tendency of the biological clock to extend the day). </font><p> <p><font size="4"> Finally, alcohol is known to disrupt sleep dramatically and   therefore contributes to the poor quantity and quality of sleep obtained on   trip nights. Alternative approaches to the use of alcohol to unwind after duty   and promote sleep should be identified and offered (e.g., relaxation techniques).</font><p><i></i> <i> </i><i><address> <hr>Last Update: February 18, 1998</address></i></BODY>
