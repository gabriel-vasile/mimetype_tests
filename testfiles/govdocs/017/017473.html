      <p>By applying a small electrical current to a carbon nanotube, they moved 
        indium particles along the tube like auto parts on an assembly line. Their 
        research, described in the April 29 issue of <i>Nature</i>, lays the groundwork 
        for the high-throughput construction of atomic-scale optical, electronic, 
        and mechanical devices that will power the burgeoning field of nanotechnology.</p>
      <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not transporting atoms one at a time anymore &#8212; 
        it&#8217;s more like a hose,&#8221; says Chris Regan of Berkeley Lab&#8217;s 
        Materials Sciences Division, who co-authored the article along with fellow 
        Materials Sciences researchers Shaul Aloni, Ulrich Dahmen, Robert Ritchie, 
        and Alex Zettl. Aloni, Regan, and Zettl are also scientists in the University 
        of California at Berkeley&#8217;s Department of Physics, where much of 
        the work was conducted.</p>
      <p>The ability to shuttle a stream of particles to precise locations fills 
        a void that has stymied the efficient assembly of nanostructures. For 
        years, scientists have been able to simultaneously deliver millions of 
        atoms to millions of sites simply by mixing chemicals. Although this fast 
        technique has grown quite sophisticated, it remains far too blunt to build 
        atomic-scale devices. On the other end of the spectrum is the ability 
        to manipulate individual atoms, a feat that came of age in 1990 when IBM 
        researchers spelled out the company logo by positioning 35 xenon atoms 
        with a scanning tunneling microscope. Although precise, this technique 
        is painstakingly slow, with no way to swiftly deliver atoms to the work 
        area.</p>
      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s either all at once, or excruciatingly serial,&#8221; 
        says Regan. &#8220;So we combined incredibly precise localization with 
        something that has higher throughput.&#8221;</p>
      <p>This middle ground is made possible by carbon nanotubes, which are hollow 
        cylinders of pure carbon about ten thousand times smaller than the diameter 
        of a human hair. Since their discovery in the sooty residue of vaporized 
        carbon rods, these incredibly strong and versatile macromolecules have 
        been engineered into frictionless bearings, telescoping rods, and the 
        world's smallest room-temperature diodes. Now, they&#8217;re poised to 
        change the way these and other devices are constructed. </p>

      <p>As described in their <i>Nature</i> article, the research team thermally evaporated 
        indium metal onto a bundle of carbon nanotubes. The amount of evaporated 
        metal is so small it populates the tubes&#8217; surfaces as isolated indium 
        crystals, instead of uniformly coating them. The bundle is then placed 
        inside a transmission electron microscope, where a tungsten tip mounted 
        on the end of a nanomanipulator approaches one nanotube. After physical 
        contact is made between the tip and the free end of the nanotube, voltage 
        is applied between the tip and the other end of the nanotube, creating 
        a circuit. This sends an electrical current through the nanotube, which 
        generates thermal energy that heats the indium particles. </p>
      <p>Next, if the voltage and thermal energy is carefully controlled, something 
        strange occurs. Real-time video of the nanotube&#8217;s surface captures 
        an indium particle as it disappears, while the particle to its right grows. 
        Several seconds later, that newly enlarged particle also disappears, replaced 
        by another even further to the right. Like squeezing the last bits of 
        toothpaste from a tube, particles to the left become smaller while those 
        to the right grow.</p>
      <p>In this manner, the thermally driven indium atoms inchworm along the 
        nanotube, momentarily occupying a reservoir where a particle is located, 
        and then moving to the next, until all of the indium piles up at the end 
        of the nanotube. In the future, this nano-sized conveyor belt could be 
        aimed anywhere scientists want to deliver mass atom-by-atom &#8212; the 
        makings of a formidable nanoassembly tool. Moreover, if the voltage is 
        slightly increased, the indium&#8217;s temperature increases, and the 
        metal moves from left to right more quickly.</p>
      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the equivalent of turning a knob with my hand and taking 
        macroscale control of nanoscale mass transport,&#8221; Regan says. &#8220;And 
        it&#8217;s reversible: we can change the current&#8217;s polarity and 
        drive the indium back to its original position.&#8221;</p>
      <p>In other words, indium can be repeatedly moved back and forth along the 
        nanotube without losing a single atom. Nothing is lost in transit. This 
        conservation of mass occurs because the atoms don&#8217;t evaporate from 
        the system during their journey &#8212; an advantage in any process meant 
        to deliver valuable material to a worksite. Instead, the atoms hug the 
        nanotube&#8217;s surface as they move, tethered by a process called surface 
        diffusion. </p>
      <p>&#8220;In order to build a structure we have to be able transport material 
        to the construction site, and we&#8217;re developing a better way to do 
        that,&#8221; Regan says. &#8220;Our nanoscale mass delivery system is 
        simple and reversible. It requires only a nanotube, a voltage source, 
        and something to transport.&#8221;</p>
