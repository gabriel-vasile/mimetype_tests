On the off chance it has been answered in private email,
can anyone out there provide information (or pointers to

Hi
I have a question to sky models produced with gensky. If I use the  
option -c for an CIE overcast sky and calculate the illuminace, the  
value outside of my building is nearly 8800 lx.
A check of this value with other programs (LuMagic, LumenMicro or  
with a handish calculation like DIN 5034 (German norm book)) brings  
me some trouble. For the same day at the same place are the values  
between 11500lx and 12000lx (also for an overcast sky).
If I use the option -u (uniform sky) to produce a sky.rad file and  
calculate the illuminace outside the building, I got a value nearly  
the same like the other programs.
i use the PC-Version of radiance.
So my question is: Has anyone an idea what happens and is this maybe  
a proplem of the PC-Version??
Thanks a lot in front!

Hi Mathias,

The numbers to use for average zenith luminance are never agreed upon.  I'm
surprised that your other calculations are in such close agreement.  If you
want a reliable absolute value for ANY sky condition, you must specify the
zenith radiance either directly with the -b option or indirectly via the
-B option of gensky.  This is not a fault of the PC version, just a difference
in the default quantity used by various programs.

-Greg

P.S.  There is usually data available for the mean irradiance or illuminance
(use the conversion factor 179 lumens/watt to go between the two) in weather
almanacs and the like.

I recently turned off all the light sources in what used to be an 
external view of a daylit building (I wanted to model it floodlit at 
night). When I ran rview (or rpict) it correctly identified that there 
were no light sources but the resulting image shows the building to be 
almost self illuminating. Where surfaces face each other the light is 
quite significant.

Thinking that this was my mistake (a rogue light source in the scene 
files) I used the following simple scene and rad file...

###############################################

###############################################

I've used the above on both Radiance V2.5 and V2.4 on a Linux box and an 
SGI Challenge machine (R8000's under Irix6) and the stone steps are 
clearly visible.

Can anybody tell me why I can see the steps when there is no light in the 
environment?

Hi Rob,

This didn't get sent to radiance-discuss because the list is still disabled,
but that's OK because I can answer your question pretty easily.

The problem is that rad sets the ambient value based on the EXPOSURE setting
in the .rif file, and your setting of 0.0358 results in a -av setting of
14 14 14.  Any non-zero setting in a scene without sky or light sources
will make the surfaces appear to glow.  You need to change your exposure
setting to something more reasonable for a nighttime scene in order to
get the right results.

Hope this clears things up.

"!! This job is recovered from page 2 !! (Note: There may be a few

Using TRAD and sending the print job to a QMS 810 postscript printer

If I display the postscript file generated by TRAD (ra_ps) with SUN's

Is this a known problem and has it already been solved? if not will

these types of material (including the one you mentioned in particular).
She also has some experience using Radiance, and I thought she might have
modeled this before.  Just speaking with her now, it seems that she hasn't,
and cited the general lack of information from the manufacturer (3M)
regarding the material's properties.

I have added your e-mail address to both the Radiance announcement/digest

I would like to hear from people that have tried it before.
Is there a new/old good way to do such conversion.

I am working with a DOS version of Radiance, and I do not seem to have 
the Torad conversion program. (How good does it work? and what other 
possibilities are there?)

A DOS/Windows version of the torad program (called radout) is available
from me for an investment recovery fee of $50.00.  It is based on a
Unix version of the radout program for Unix AutoCAD.  My programmer
enhanced the export facilities such that it creates Radiance polygons
from closed 3D PLINES.  It was specifically written to handle some of
the strange data one gets from programs like 3D Studio.  Sorry.  It
does not yet handle light sources, cameras or any of the other fancy
objects.  The version I offer runs under DOS or Windows AutoCAD R12.
If there is enough interest, I will bring it up to date with R13 and
pay for the addition of more functionality.

As far as I know 3DS has an option to write out DXF (not sure though)
>From then on you have two ways:
1. use the existing dxf2rad (should be on hobbes)
2. import it into Autocad (if you have it) and use the torad program
   or radout (more below)

If you can get on a machine with Autocad 13 you can import the 3ds files
directly. Then again use the torad utility.

Ohh, the dos version!? I heard about it but didn't know people are really
working with it. Well, as long as it reads the same geometry files like
the Radiance (Unix) distribution there should be no problem.
Regarding torad: it's a AutoLisp program and is only useful if you have
AutoCAD. It takes a AutoCAD database and writes out the Radiance
geometry, materials (all the same), a basic sunlight and groundglow
and you can also choose from a set of views (named views in ACAD)
Check the hobbes server (or mirror site in Swizerland) in /pub/translators
(or similar), there you should find this program (if not I can mail
it to you). Radout is another translator which works also inside AutoCAD
and is basically a C (ADS in this case) port of the torad program.
I have only used it once but the handling and functionality is quite the
same (hope I remember right). Personally I prefer Gerorg Mischler's torad
since I can read the code and modify it according to my needs.

Hello Everyone

Thank you very much for helping me out with my IES-problem. Now I have 
another one,

At the moment I'm working with a friend on an Autolisp routine that would 
allow conversion of a 2D base-plane drawing of a building into a Radiance 
file. The height for the walls exist only as extended data.
I'm using MGF to describe the main geometry of the scene. For the kinkier 
parts I'm working directly with the .rad file.
The problems occur when trying to describe a cylindrical shaped wall -
I would prefer not to use 'Gensurf' for the wall, instead I'd rather use 
the symmetry of the floor to construct an "extruded" piece of wall. In this
way the wall would be tessalated into rectangles -> no smoothing!


Q: Is there an easy way of "grouping" the polygons into one object so that
 the surface would look smooth.

The only way I can think of is to somehowe use as a material modifier a
bump map and try to come up with a way of interpolating the normals of 
the polygons..????

Any help would be appricated

Your Sincerely from the country where everybody currently is walking
with loads of ice in their beard

Hi John,

What exactly is the problem with gensurf? Its output is exactly the
texfuncs you need, so why reinventing the wheel?
If you stay with walls (ie. extrusion to Z direction) then the
formula
is relatively simple. Let X0, Y0, Z0 be the (lower) center of your
arc,
alpha the opening angle (start to end), a1 the starting angle
relative
to +x and H the extrusion height.
Then you get (please test before using!):

!gensurf some_material curve 'cos((PI*(PI/alpha)*s)+a1)+X0'  \
                             'sin((PI*(PI/alpha)*s)+a1)+Y0'  \
                             '(t*H)+Z0'   \
                             16 1 -s

You can tweak the number of segments (here 16) depending on the
opening
angle to get more accurate upper and lower edges.

I intend to include this functionality into the torad/radout/ddrad
suite
as soon as the ddrad portion is ready for beta testing. Therfore I'd
be
*very* happy myself if anyone could come up with a general solution
to this problem (curves roatated in space) without the need of using
xform and seperate files for every single arc ...
Btw: I hope that this test release of ddrad will be ready early next
year. The basic functionality is allready working together with my
modified copy of radout, but it still needs some more work to become
usefull to someone who has never seen it before.

Sorry John, for abusing your request again for this kind of
advertisement ... you just seem to ask the right questions ;)


hope that helps (and thanks as well for any further ideas)

Greetings Mr. Ward,
I would like to subscribe to the mailing list dedicated to the
RADIANCE package, wich impressed me very much!
 I'm using the Amiga porting of Radiance and I've found some problems
with the emulation of the unix-style shell, needed for the correct
execution of the rendering scripts.

Thanks in advance.

Massimo Curatella

Dr. Ward,

I assume this is not a mojordomo account. I would like to subscribe to 
both the moderated and unmoderated mailing lists. If for some reason this 
email has reached the wrong location please do notify me. I am going in 
accordance with the instructions listed in Radiance Digest v2n7.

I am a general raytracing enthusiast and use Radiance in conjunction with 
the rest of my hobbies. I am extremely impressed with your software. 
Perhaps someday I will have some work to display for your Radiance users!

Thank you very much,
Thomas Marsh

Subject: [Q] Porous Surfaces
Status: RO

Hello,

I am very new to the Radiance system, so please excuse my ignorance. I 
have attempted to educate myself thus far with the materal at 
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance but I have not been able to understand 
many portions. I will explain what I am trying to do.

I would like to create a pumice-like surface. (Pumice is a type of lava 
rock with lots of holes in it.) The obvious solution is to define my 
object and then create a random distribution of small antimatter spheres 
with varying radii. -But that is a very ugly hack. I am trying to find a 
way to do this so that I can apply it to any object.

I would assume this would be easier to do in Radiance than almost any 
other renderer, so perhaps that is why I cannot figure out how to do it.

Thanks for any suggestions!
Thomas

Dear Mr. Gregory Ward,

After some help from Jan Hensen currently
in Korea I would like to ask you to subscribe
myself to the both Radiance discussion lists.

For some time I am back in my home university
in Bratislava, Slovakia. So please you could
unsubscribe my ESRU address milan@esru.strath.ac.uk
or clcv64@strath.ac.uk.

I am currently working on the time variable illuminance
predictions with Radiance. Currently we do not have
UNIX machines here in Slovakia so we are using Radiance
DOS version from the ADELINE package. I would like to
use gendaylit program which is not included in ADELINE.
Could you let me know where I could find source code
for the gendaylit.

With best regards,

Milan Janak

Hello...
 
   I am conducting an experiment, in the spirit of the studies with the
Cornell box, where I will be comparing a computer rendered scene
(rendered with RADIANCE) with an equivalent scene in the real world.  
As such, I will need to find luminarires and materials in the real 
world whose physical data is accurately recorded and generally available.
   
   I was wondering if anyone can recommend any particular luminaires
whose illumination data is available (and considered accurate) and/or 
materials whose BRDF data is available (and also accurate) and where
I might obtain such data.

   Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I have had the same problems ...
And I try to substitude with a generic -lX11
but when I try to use rpict or rview that use X11 output device
there was a bad suprise....
I try to compile the 2.6a or b  Release of radiance.
With the 2.5 (Official Release ) all is ok but the new feature of
2.6 realease are really interesting.
Dear Grag try to light myself....... and my compiler...

I don't rememeber very well... because I try to compile two
week ago...
Tomorrow I will be more exact.
But what You can imagine that all executable that try to
to use X11 library wasn't campile.
When I correct with "-lX11" the -lXmshr link, the rpict and rview 
executable were built.
But when I try to make a render there wasn't any answer or beginning of 
trace.
Tomorrow I will send another more exact mail.

Subject: Radiance and Linux/XFree86 at 16bpp
To: radiance-discuss@hobbes.lbl.gov
Status: RO

Hi all,

I've been running Radiance on a Linux box for some time but have only 
ever been able to get it to work with the X server running at 8bpp.

Since I've decided to go the ELF way I decided to try and fix all the 
littel problems that were bothering me, particularly this Radiance one.

I'm not in working distance of the Linux box in question so I can't give 
you all the details but the gist is:

	-RedHat Distribution v2.1
	-Kernel 1.2.13
	-XFree86 3.1.2
	-P5/100 CPU
	-Diamond Stealth 64 2M DRAM

I'm assuming that the X parts of Radiance (rview, ximage etc) can work at 
higher colour depths than 8bpp. XFree does.

Anyway, if anyone out there can help it would be very much appreciated.


PS: just some superfluous info for those considerin the change to ELF - 
if you want/need to compile the Radiance binaries make sure that the 
Makefile is explicit about where it can find the X libs. Running the 
script straight out of the box didn't work for me. -L/usr/X11/lib needed 
to be explicitly added to the gcc line for the X11 bits to be made.

I am having almost the same configuration (also Diamond Stealth) and it
is true that Radiace doesn't recognize the 16bpp visual, but you can use
the Diamond Card with 32bpp and Radiance runs perfectly well with this 
visual.

I use Slackware 3.0 ELF and Radiance compiled without any problems at all.
