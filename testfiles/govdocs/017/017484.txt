This directory /rooms/in2p3B/pverdier/2EMhighpt contains p20.04.01 TMB
for RunIIb data passing the "2EMhighpt" event flag. 

* Data sample:
--------------

All run2b data recorded after the 4th of August 2006, and which were 
reconstructed when submitting the jobs (2006/09/04).
=> run range : [223953-224749]
~700,000 events in total
SAM dataset definitions per run for the unskimmed files: pv-tmbp200401-<RunNumber>

The skimming was done using the event flag computed in d0reco.
Definition of the SKIM_2EMhighpt event flag:
(np_tmb_stream/rcp/2EMhighpt_stream.rcp)

* TMB files for this 2EMhighpt skim :
/rooms/in2p3B/pverdier/2EMhighpt/TMBStream_x-p20.04.01-maxopt-Linux-pv-tmbp200401-22*/CSskim-2EMhighpt

jobs were ran per run, but there might be few parallel jobs per run. 
The name of the output directories means:  
TMBStream_x-p20.04.01-maxopt-Linux-pv-tmbp200401-<Run-Number>-<jobID>

becareful, there might be few directories with runnumber < 223953

* np_tmb_stream code is on :
/work/shaul-clued0/pverdier/calgo/p20.04.01_np_tmb_stream

* Known problems :

run 224680 crashed
I have not check that all jobs processed all the files they had to.
Few unskimmed files were not delivered, but I will not try to process them.
The goal is only to have enough Z->ee statistic until the official CSskim
are produced.
