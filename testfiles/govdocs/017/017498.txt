 Preface

The National Science Foundation's Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) provides
funding support to U.S. colleges and universities and other non-profit
institutions for the conduct of research and education in most areas of the
solid-earth sciences.   Emphasis is on the support of basic research aimed at
an improved understanding of the earth's structure, properties, processes, and
evolution, including basic research in areas of practical importance.  The
Division is a participant in the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program
(NEHRP) and supports research under the Fundamental Earthquake Studies element
of that program.

The purpose of this Summary of Awards for the Division of Earth Sciences is to
provide the scientific and engineering communities with a summary of those
grants awarded in Fiscal Year 1994.  This report lists only those projects
that received funding with Fiscal Year 1994 dollars.  Awards listed with a
duration of "0" months represent supplemental funding to already existing
awards.

Awards are grouped together by the Programs which are managing the award.  The
reader is cautioned, however, not to assume that these titles represent the
totality of interests of each program, or the total scope of each grant.
Projects may bridge several programs or deal with topics not explicitly
mentioned herein.

In this document, award numbers, principal investigators, and awardee
institutions are identified first.  The award amounts and award duration are
enumerated after the individual project titles.  Within each program the
awards are listed alphabetically by the principal investigators last name.
The Division of Earth Sciences is responsible for the information cited in
this document.

from the National Science Foundation.

Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED)
provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with
disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
assistants) to work on NSF projects.  See the program announcement or contact
