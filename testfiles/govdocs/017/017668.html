	 <P>Published predicted transmitting abilities (<B>PTA</B>'s) for productive
		life (<B>PL</B>) have been computed using approximate multi-trait methods since
		July 1994. Evaluations of PL are based on direct observations of length of
		productive life and also correlated traits measured earlier in life.
		Multi-trait PTA's have higher reliability (<B>REL</B>) than single-trait PTA's,
		which include only culling observations. New programs were introduced in August
		2000 by the Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (<B>AIPL</B>) to combine
		direct and indirect information about longevity. Evaluations of milk, fat, and
		protein yields; somatic cell score (<B>SCS</B>); and udder, feet and legs
		(<B>F&amp;L</B>), and body size composites were included in the multi-trait
		predictions.</P> 
	 <P>The traits and correlations included in multi-trait PL were extended to
		include stillbirths in August 2006 and daughter pregnancy rate (<B>DPR</B>),
		service sire calving ease (<B>SCE</B>), and daughter calving ease (<B>DCE</B>)
		in November 2003. The four calving ease and stillbirth traits are combined
		before use in PL predictions, and DPR is the most important individual trait in
		predicting PL. Correlation estimates were revised in November 2000, August
		2002, and August 2006. In previous revisions, the influence of yield traits in
		PL predictions was reduced because correlations of yield traits with PL have
		decreased over time. In November 2000, foreign bulls received credit for
		correlated yield and type traits instead of just parent average (<B>PA</B>) or
		breed average for PL . In May 2001, Interbull somatic cell score evaluations
		became available and were used as another correlated trait to increase the
		reliability of estimated PL for foreign bulls.</P>

	 <P><B><I>Holsteins</I></B>. The multi-trait PTA's for PL begin with
		single-trait evaluations, which have been calculated at AIPL since January 1994
		for all breeds. The single-trait PL evaluations for Holstein bulls were
		combined with information from yield and type PTA's by Holstein Association USA
		beginning in July 1994 to produce approximate multi-trait PTA's for PL.
		Advantages of the multi-trait analysis are greatest when daughters are in first
		lactation because yield and type data arrive before culling information. The
		single-trait methods were described by VanRaden and Klaaskate (1993,
		<A
		 HREF="http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/76/9/2758.pdf"><I>Journal
		of Dairy Science</I> 76:2758</A>) and VanRaden and Wiggans (1995,
		<A
		 HREF="http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/78/3/631.pdf"><I>Journal
		of Dairy Science</I> 78:631</A>). The Holstein Association multi-trait methods
		were described by Weigel (1996, <I>International Bull Evaluation Service
		Bulletin</I> 12:125) and Weigel et al. (1998,
		<A HREF="http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/81/7/2040.pdf"><I>Journal of Dairy Science</I> 81:2040</A>). </P> 
	 <P>New computer programs were introduced to combine single-trait PTA PL
		into approximate multi-trait PTA PL (VanRaden, 2001,
		<A HREF="http://aipl.arsusda.gov/publish/jds/2001/jds84_e47.pdf"><I>Journal of
		Dairy Science</I> 84:E47-E55</A>) beginning with August 2000 evaluations.
		Udder, feet and legs, and body size composites (Holstein Association USA, 2000,
		<I>Holstein Type-Production Sire Summaries, August</I>, p. 12-13) were provided
		to AIPL before evaluation release day for use in the calculation of economic
		indexes for lifetime net merit. Because of the earlier availability of type
		information, calculation of multi-trait evaluations for PL was transferred from
		Holstein Association USA to AIPL. Major differences from the Holstein
		Association programs were that PTA SCS was included in PL predictions and that
		PL predictions begin with PA and only adjust the Mendelian sampling for
		information from correlated traits. Other differences were that the udder,
		F&amp;L, and body size composites are used in PL prediction rather than all 17
		individual linear type traits. Also, all three yield traits (milk, fat, and
		protein) were used in PL prediction instead of just two (milk and fat). Earlier
		studies excluded SCS and protein because data for those traits were not widely
		available in earlier years. </P> 
	 <P><I><B>Other breeds</B></I>. The AIPL programs to compute multi-trait
		PTA's for PL also were implemented in August 2000 for breeds other than
		Holstein after testing with August 1999 data. The Holstein genetic correlation
		matrix was used for the other breeds. PTA's for the individual linear type
		traits are converted to standardized transmitting abilities (<B>STA</B>'s) by
		dividing by the standard deviation (<B>SD</B>) of the true transmitting ability
		before combining the traits into the composites. Composites have slightly
		different definitions based on breed specific research and because some
		Holstein traits are not measured by the other breeds. Details regarding the
		traits included in each composite and their relative values can be found in the
		<A HREF="http://aipl.arsusda.gov/reference/nmcalc-2003.htm#Type">Lifetime Net
		Merit</A> report. </P>

	 <P>The AIPL PL programs were designed to combine single-trait PTA's into
		multi-trait predictions of PL for cows as well as for bulls. Expected
		correlations among the differences between PTA and PA for each trait for cows
		are determined from the daughter equivalents from the cow's own records and
		progeny instead of only from progeny as for bulls. The methods were tested with
		May 2000 data and implemented in August 2000. </P>

	 <P>Genetic merit for PL can be predicted from both direct and indirect
		measurements of correlated traits (multi-trait analysis). Information on yield
		(milk, fat, and protein), mastitis resistance (SCS), type (udder, F&amp;L, and
		body size composites), cow fertility (DPR), and calving ease (SCE and DCE) is
		now included. </P> 
	 <P>Evaluations for PL from single-trait and approximate multi-trait
		procedures were compared for bulls in active artificial-insemination
		(<B>AI</B>) service, elite cows, and all bulls or cows in various birth year

	 <P>The gains in REL for PTA PL with the AIPL multi-trait methods were
		higher than with the previous approach. The Holstein Association programs for
		PL used regression on PTA without removing parent contribution. The REL from
		that approach was lower because indirect rather than direct evaluations of
		parents were used whenever indirect traits of daughters were included. That use
		of indirect PL for parents limited the gain in bull REL because most sires had
		a direct REL of 99%, whereas their indirect REL was only about 60%. The USDA
		programs subtract PA from PTA and then apply regressions to the estimates of
		Mendelian sampling.</P> 
	 <P>For Holstein bulls in active AI service and for elite Holstein cows,
		multi-trait PTA's for PL were higher than single-trait PTA's as expected.
		However, for all Holstein bulls and cows that were born during recent years,
		little difference was found for average PTA PL between AIPL single-trait and
		multi-trait methods. Correlations of single-trait PTA PL with multi-trait PTA
		were .85 for AIPL multi-trait PL and .95 for Holstein Association multi-trait
		PL. Holstein Assocation multi-trait PTA PL was correlated by only 0.88 to AIPL
		multi-trait PTA PL. Those correlations are consistent with the larger gains in
		REL from the new procedures. </P> 
	 <P>For recent Jersey bulls with August 1999 PTA's, average PTA PL was .66
		months with a standard deviation (<B>SD</B>) of 1.14 months for single-trait PL
		and .62 months with an SD of 1.24 months for multi-trait PL. Average
		reliability (<B>REL</B>) increased from 52% for single-trait PL to 58% for
		multi-trait PL, and the two predictions were correlated by .88. For other
		non-Holstein breeds, increases in REL were 5%, which was somewhat larger than
		the 3% increase reported for Holsteins by Weigel et al. (<A
		HREF="http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/81/7/2040.pdf">1998</A>)
		because SCS was included and because bulls that had no daughters measured for
		PL (all daughters less than 3 years old) were included for the non-Holstein
		breeds. </P> 
	 <P>Because DPR, SCS, and type traits are missing for some relatives, the
		AIPL multi-trait programs also were tested for upgrading single-trait PTA's for
		DPR, SCS, and udder composite to multi-trait PTA's that use correlated
		information from other traits. For Holstein bulls, the average REL increased
		only from 68.6 to 68.9% for SCS and from 77.9 to 78.1% for udder composite. For
		Holstein cows, REL increased from 32.8 to 33.2% for SCS and from 30.0 to 31.6%
		for udder composite. The small gains in evaluation accuracy for those traits
		did not justify the added computing complexity that would be required for
		routine evaluations, but gains were larger for DPR. Therefore, the multi-trait
		procedure is applied only to PL and to DPR since

	 <P>Heritabilities were obtained from official evaluation procedures except
		that Jersey heritabilities for type were used for all non-Holstein breeds
		instead of the official values, which vary by breed. Genetic and phenotypic
		correlations were based on estimates from scientific studies for Holsteins such
		as Tsuruta et al. (2005,
		<A HREF="http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/88/3/1156.pdf"><I>Journal of Dairy

	 <P>Maximum indirect REL's indicate how well the genetic merit for a trait
		can be estimated based on data only from other traits. Such REL's were computed
		for each trait from the genetic correlations with all other traits using
		multiple regression. Inclusion of DPR as an additional trait in the predictions
		greatly increased the potential to predict PL, primarily because of the strong
		genetic correlation of DPR with PL. For August 2006 evaluations, maximum

	 <P>The relative weights assigned to progeny data that are used in
		multi-trait PTA PL calculation differ for each animal based on how many
		daughter equivalents are present for each trait. As the REL for single-trait
		PTA PL approaches 99%, the weight assigned to single-trait PTA PL approaches
		1.0 and the weights assigned to the correlated traits decline to 0 . For this
		bull, the single-trait PTA PL had a REL of only 55% and received a weight of
		32% because most daughters were still fairly young. Correlated traits such as
		PTA DPR received a weight of 15%, PTA's for yield traits received a total
		weight of 7%, and PTA udder received a weight of 11%. Traits that are more
		highly correlated with PL and that have higher heritabilities receive more
		weight than traits with lower correlations and heritabilities. For this bull
		and many others, much of the information about PL comes from the highly
		reliable PL evaluations of the sire and dam. </P> 
	 <P>The example bull's single-trait PTA PL was +1.1 month with a REL of 55%,
		but his multi-trait PTA PL was +2.0 mo with 62% REL. His multi-trait PTA PL was
		slightly higher than his single-trait PTA PL because his early evaluations for
		yield, DPR, and udder traits indicated that he had received a favorable set of
		genes for PL (as compared with his PA for PL).</P> 
	 <P>As a second example, suppose this bull had no single-trait evaluation
		for PL because his daughters were not yet 36 months old. His multi-trait PTA
		would then be +2.1 instead of +2.0 and his multi-trait REL would be only 58%
		instead of 62% if no direct information from daughter culling was present. The
		weights on the other traits would be higher, with a sum of 9% for yield traits,
		-14% for SCS, 23% for DPR, 16% for udder, 12% for feet and leg, and -13% for
		size composite, and 14% on calving ability index, to make up for the 0% weight
		on the single-trait PL. When compared to the parent average PL with REL of 46%,
		the gain in REL from using correlated traits would be 12% for the second
		example. Advantages are greatest from the middle of first lactation when
		pregnancy rate data arrives until the beginning of second lactation when actual
		culling rates become known. The multi-trait approach does not produce large
		gains in REL but allows information from correlated traits to be used for new
		bulls and foreign bulls that have little or no daughter culling information
		available. </P> </BODY>
