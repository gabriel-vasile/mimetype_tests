<p>	Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;
16(b)-(h) ("APPA" or "Tunney Act"), the United States hereby responds to the public comments
received regarding the proposed Final Judgment in this case.  After careful consideration of the
comments, the United States continues to believe that the proposed Final Judgment will provide
an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust violation alleged in the Complaint.  The
United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment after the public
comments and this Response have been published in the <em>Federal Register</em>, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
&#167; 16(d). 

<p>	On May 31, 2007, the United States filed the Complaint in this matter alleging that the
proposed acquisition of Delta and Pine Land Company ("DPL") by Monsanto Company
("Monsanto") would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 18.  Simultaneously with
the filing of the Complaint, the United States filed the proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation
signed by plaintiff and defendants consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment after
compliance with the requirements of the Tunney Act.  Pursuant to those requirements, the United
States filed a Competitive Impact Statement ("CIS") in this Court on May 31, 2007; published
the proposed Final Judgment and CIS in the <em>Federal Register </em>on June 15, 2007, <em>see</em> <em>United
States v. Monsanto Co. and Delta and Pine Land Co.</em>, 72 Fed. Reg. 33336-01, 2007 WL
1708314; and published summaries of the terms of the proposed Final Judgment and CIS,
together with directions for the submission of written comments relating to the proposed Final
Judgment, in <em>The Washington Post</em> for seven days beginning on June 28, 2007 and ending on
July 4, 2007.  The 60-day period for public comments ended on August 27, 2007, and eleven
comments were received as described below and are attached hereto. 

<p><a name="2"></a><ol type="I"><strong><li>Background</li></strong> 	

<p><a name="3"></a><ol type="A"><strong><li>The United States's Investigation of the Transaction</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	On August 14, 2006, Monsanto entered into an agreement to acquire DPL for
approximately $1.5 billion.  Over the following nine and a half months, the United States
conducted an extensive, detailed investigation into the competitive effects of the proposed
transaction.  As part of this investigation, the United States issued Second Requests to the
merging parties, as well as Civil Investigative Demands to all of the major cottonseed companies
and cottonseed trait developers.  The United States received and considered more than a million
pages of responsive material and deposed relevant Monsanto and DPL executives.  More than
125 interviews were conducted with customers, competitors, and others with knowledge of the
industry and competitive conditions, including national and regional agricultural supply
companies, grower organization representatives, USDA cotton experts, and agricultural
economists and academics.  The United States met repeatedly with concerned parties, including
DuPont, one of the commenters, analyzing their allegations and submissions.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<p>	In its investigation, the United States considered the potential competitive effects of this
transaction on numerous products and geographic areas.  For several of these, the United States
concluded that the proposed merger was unlikely to reduce competition.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
  As the Complaint
alleges, the transaction did, however, threaten competition with respect to traited cottonseed sales
in two geographic regions &#8212; the MidSouth and the Southeast.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

<p><a name="4"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>The Traited Cottonseed Markets</li></strong></ol></ol>  

<p>	Most cottonseed sold today contains "transgenic traits" &#8212; genetic material from other
organisms that is inserted into the cottonseed germplasm to give the cotton plant desirable
characteristics.  Two types of transgenic traits currently are available: (1) herbicide tolerance
traits, such as Monsanto's "Roundup Ready" and recently introduced "Roundup Ready Flex"
("Flex"), which make the cotton plant able to withstand spraying with particular herbicides, and
(2) insect resistance traits, such as Monsanto's "Bollgard" and new "Bollgard II," which make
the cotton plant toxic to certain pests.  

<p>	Cotton farmers overwhelmingly prefer traited seeds because their use significantly
reduces labor and input costs.  In 2006, farmers planted about 87% of the cotton acres in the U.S.
with traited seeds.  <em>USDA Cotton Varieties Planted 2006 Crop Report</em>.  Most traited cottonseed
is "stacked" to include both herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant traits.  In the Southeast and
MidSouth, 90.8% and 89.3% (respectively) of the seed sold in 2006 included both types of traits,
and farmers now rarely purchase seed that contains only an insect-resistant trait.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<p>	At the time the Complaint was filed, DPL and Monsanto, via its Stoneville business unit,
were significant producers of traited cottonseed in the United States.  Indeed, DPL and Stoneville
together accounted for over 90% of traited cottonseed sales in the MidSouth and Southeast
regions of the United States where cotton farmers place the most value on insect-resistant and
herbicide-tolerant traits.  That vigorous competition would have been lost as a result of the
transaction. 

<p>	As the Complaint alleges, Monsanto is currently the dominant provider of insect-resistant
and herbicide-tolerant traits for cotton.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
 Monsanto's insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant traits
accounted for over 96% of the transgenic traits in cottonseed nationwide in 2006; over 98% of
the traited cottonseed sold in 2006 in the MidSouth and Southeast contained Monsanto's traits. 
Indeed, Monsanto's traits are the only traits found in <em>any</em> of the traited cottonseed DPL sold prior
to the merger. 

<p>	DPL was, however, positioning itself to move away from Monsanto's traits by exploring
options with several trait producers that were developing insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant
cotton traits.  The most advanced of these efforts was work with Syngenta to introduce VipCot &#8212;
an insect-resistant trait that would compete with Monsanto's Bollgard traits.  DPL's work with
Syngenta had reached a stage where DPL had successfully introduced VipCot into 42 of its elite
breeding lines.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
 DPL had already stacked five of the VipCot traited lines with Flex prior to the
merger and anticipated commercializing those lines in approximately 2009.  Following DPL's
breeding protocols, DPL anticipated that stacked versions of the other 37 VipCot lines would
have been ready for commercialization sometime between 2012 through 2016.   

<p>	DPL's efforts with respect to a non-Monsanto herbicide-tolerant trait were at a more
preliminary stage.  In the summer of 2006, DPL entered into a licensing agreement with DuPont
to introduce seed with OptimumGat, an herbicide-tolerant trait that would compete with
Monsanto's Flex trait.  At the time the Complaint was filed, DPL had not successfully introduced
OptimumGat into any of its elite breeding lines.  Rather, development work to advance the
OptimumGat project remained primarily with DuPont.  As a backup to the OptimumGat venture,
DPL had also entered into agreements to test two other herbicide-tolerant traits that would
compete with Monsanto's Flex, including a trait being developed by Bayer called Glytol. 

<p>	Using VipCot in combination with one of the three herbicide tolerance options that DPL
was exploring, DPL envisioned bringing a limited quantity of cottonseed with a non-Monsanto
stack of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant traits to market as early as 2012.  But in light of
standard breeding and testing time requirements, it likely would have taken DPL several years
longer to entirely phase out Monsanto's traits.  Equally important, DPL's ability or willingness to
switch totally away from Monsanto's traits was dependent on several assumptions &#8212; namely that
farmers were satisfied with VipCot's performance versus Monsanto's Bollgard traits, and that
DPL found a successful non-Monsanto herbicide-tolerant trait in the next few years.

<p>	As the Complaint further alleges, Monsanto knew that DPL was working with other trait
companies and feared that a possible outcome of those partnerships would be that DPL ceased
offering Monsanto's traits in its cottonseeds.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
  Monsanto thus had begun to take steps to
strengthen its own proprietary seed platform to support its cottonseed trait business.  In fact, the
United States's investigation revealed that Monsanto was making a concerted effort to grow its
share of traited cottonseed sales.  

<p>	Foremost among these efforts was Monsanto's acquisition in 2005 of Stoneville, which
had approximately 15% of the market for traited cottonseed nationwide and a 33% and 9% share
of the MidSouth and Southeast markets, respectively.  After acquiring Stoneville, Monsanto
made significant investments in the company, including: investing in upgrades of new buildings
and greenhouses, lab equipment, ginning and delinting equipment, and warehouse and equipment
storage; hiring additional employees for the breeding facilities, particularly at its Maricopa,
Arizona, breeding facility which targeted creating varieties for the Southeast; improving
Stoneville's manufacturing facilities, such as adding bagging, dust collection, and handling
equipment; and improving Stoneville's molecular marker capabilities and library.  

<p>	 Monsanto also had been engaging in other efforts to develop proprietary cotton
germplasm.  Those included (a) researching exotic strains of cottonseed (which the proposed
Final Judgment refers to as the "Advanced Exotic Yield Lines"), (b) mapping molecular markers
for select breeding crosses that would enable Monsanto to expedite identification and further
breeding of the most promising progeny from those crosses (which the proposed Final Judgment
refers to as the "MAB Populations"), and (c) establishing the Cotton States program, through
which Monsanto obtains licenses to promising germplasm from university breeding programs
and private breeders, and, after introducing traits, licenses the resulting traited cottonseed
varieties to small cottonseed companies and distributors seeking to sell traited cottonseed under
their own brands.

<p>	Monsanto's internal business plans projected that as a result of these efforts, Stoneville's
market share in the Southeast and MidSouth would grow substantially over the next few years. 
Indeed, Monsanto projected that Stoneville, with Monsanto traits, and DPL, with non-Monsanto
traits, would have roughly equal market shares by approximately 2015, with Dow and Bayer
traited seeds holding much smaller shares.  Accordingly, if unremedied, the combination of
Monsanto and DPL would have combined the two largest traited cottonseed options for farmers
in the MidSouth and Southeast.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
 

<p><a name="5"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="3"><strong><li>The Competitive Effects of the Transaction</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Based on this evidence, the United States determined that the merger of the two
companies would likely lessen competition in the near, medium and long term.  In the near term,
absent the transaction, Monsanto's efforts to increase Stoneville share in the MidSouth and
Southeast would give farmers more choices and could lead to lower prices.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
 Also in the near
term (beginning in approximately 2009), the entry of DPL seed containing Syngenta's VipCot
trait stacked with Monsanto's Flex trait could have offered farmers a new insect-resistant trait
option and put some pressure on the price for insect-resistant traits.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
  The United States's
investigation revealed that the most significant competitive effect of the transaction likely would
have occurred in the medium term (beginning in approximately 2012) when DPL would first be
able to offer cottonseed stacked solely with non-Monsanto traits and farmers in the MidSouth
and Southeast would benefit from the emergence of competition between two germplasm/trait
platforms, namely, Stoneville seed with Monsanto traits and DPL seed with VipCot and a
non-Monsanto herbicide-tolerant trait. 

<p>	The United States also found that Monsanto's acquisition of DPL, if unremedied, would
threaten longer term harm by deterring or delaying the entry of new types of cotton traits in the
MidSouth and Southeast.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
  Cotton trait developers would not have a seed partner independent of
Monsanto with seeds suitable for the MidSouth and Southeast.  Given the significance of the
MidSouth and Southeast cotton growing regions, the inability to reach farmers in these regions
would reduce potential returns from investments in developing cotton traits.  And even if other
potential sources of revenue for trait developers were sufficient to support continued investment
in cotton trait development,<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
 the benefits of these investments would not reach farmers in the
MidSouth and Southeast.  			

<p><a name="6"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="4"><strong><li>The Proposed Remedy</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	The proposed Final Judgment remedies the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition
alleged in the Complaint &#8212; the elimination of competition between DPL and Monsanto for the
development, breeding and sale of traited cottonseed and the elimination of DPL as a partner
independent of Monsanto for developers of traits that would compete against Monsanto &#8212; in three
principal ways:

<p>	First, the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to divest the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets to an acquirer who is capable of using the assets to compete effectively.  The Enhanced
Stoneville Assets include Stoneville's U.S. cottonseed business, key cottonseed lines developed
by DPL for the MidSouth and Southeast, and additional Monsanto cotton breeding assets.

<p>	The Enhanced Stoneville Assets provide the acquirer what it needs to continue
Monsanto's efforts to increase Stoneville's share and be an effective ongoing seed competitor in
the near term and beyond.  Moreover, the acquirer will be able to use these assets, on its own or
in partnership with other trait developers, to breed and commercialize high quality cottonseed for
the MidSouth and Southeast with non-Monsanto traits, preserving medium and longer-term
competition that would otherwise have been lost as a result of the merger.  

<p>	Second, the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to divest the VipCot assets to
Syngenta and to allow Syngenta to breed with the VipCot traited lines.  This will preserve the
potential for near term benefits from VipCot entry, as well as medium and longer term benefits
from stacking VipCot with non-Monsanto herbicide traits (including other nascent traits) and
developing improved germplasm. 

<p>	Third, the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to modify two sets of licenses to
eliminate restrictions on the use of non-Monsanto traits:  (1) its cottonseed trait licenses with
seed companies to permit licensees to breed and sell, without penalty, cottonseed containing
non-Monsanto traits and cottonseed containing both licensed Monsanto traits and non-Monsanto
traits, and (2) its Cotton States licenses to remove any provision that allows Monsanto to
terminate the license if the licensee sells cottonseed containing other traits.	

<p>	 In the United States's judgment, the asset divestitures and license modifications required
by the proposed Final Judgment remedy the competitive harms identified in the Complaint.  

<p><a name="7"></a><ol type="I" start="2"><strong><li>Developments Since the Filing of the Complaint</li></strong></ol>

<p>	The United States filed the Complaint and Proposed Final Judgment on May 31, 2007. 
The Court entered the Hold Separate and Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order on June 1,
2007, and Monsanto completed its acquisition of DPL on that same date.  Since the filing of the
Complaint, the following events have occurred in furtherance of the requirements set forth in the
proposed Final Judgment and the Tunney Act:

<p><a name="8"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Approval of Acquirers of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets</li></strong></ol></ol> 

<p>	Section IV.E. of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets to an acquirer acceptable to the United States.  The acquirer must have a
credible commitment to the traited cottonseed market and have the intent and capability of
competing effectively.  Shortly after acquiring DPL, Monsanto proffered Bayer CropScience
("Bayer") and Americot Inc. ("Americot") to the United States as potential acquirers of the
Enhanced Stoneville Assets, with Bayer set to acquire all of the divestiture package except for
certain assets relating to the Southwest market which would be sold to Americot.  The United
States evaluated the proposed acquirers, including analyzing the terms of the proposed purchase
agreements, the terms of other recent contracts between Monsanto and Bayer, the market
presence of both proposed acquirers, and other information bearing upon the acquirers'
capabilities to use the divested assets effectively in competition with Monsanto/DPL.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>


<p>	Bayer proposed to purchase the bulk of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets for $310 million. 
Its commitment to the cottonseed market is demonstrated by, among other things, its successful
entry into the Southwest cottonseed market under the Fibermax and AFD brands.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
  Bayer's
growth in this market has been impressive; it entered the Southwest market in 1999 and, by 2006,
had a significant share of seed sales in that region and had displaced DPL as the market leader. 
In addition to cottonseed sales, Bayer has had an active cottonseed trait development program,
which has resulted in the marketplace introduction of its Liberty Link herbicide-tolerant trait.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
In addition to these cottonseed efforts, Bayer also operates one of the world's largest crop
protection and agricultural chemical companies, providing it ready access to agricultural
distribution channels in the MidSouth and Southeast as well as pesticide, herbicide, and seed
treatment products to complement its cottonseed offerings. 

<p>	Despite these strengths, Bayer has not been successful in cottonseed sales in the
MidSouth and Southeast, largely as a result of inferior germplasm for those regions.  Acquiring
the Enhanced Stoneville Assets will enable Bayer to become a more effective competitor in the
MidSouth and Southeast<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
 by giving Bayer high-quality germplasm specifically targeted toward
the regions' growing conditions, breeding stations focused on developing varieties for those
regions, and experienced personnel.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>


<p>	To avoid creating any competitive issue in the Southwest where Bayer is strong, Bayer
did not acquire that portion of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets best suited for producing traited
cottonseed for the Southwest region of the United States &#8212; <em>i.e.</em>, the assets related to Stoneville's
NexGen brand of cottonseed.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
Those assets, which include cottonseed lines and a dedicated
breeding program targeting the Southwest, generated over $16 million in sales for Stoneville in
2006, and Monsanto projected they would generate $36 million in sales by 2010.   Americot, a
regional cottonseed company founded in 1987 that sells seed predominantly in west Texas,
acquired the NexGen assets for just over $6 million.  With a recently-upgraded breeding facility
dedicated to developing lines for the Southwest, Americot is well positioned to use the NexGen
assets effectively. 

<p>	Based on analysis of these factors, the United States determined that divestiture of the
Enhanced Stoneville Assets to Bayer and Americot satisfied the objectives of the proposed Final
Judgment and approved the proposed acquirers.  Monsanto divested the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets on June 19, 2007.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>


<p><a name="9"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>VipCot Assets Offered to Syngenta</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Section V of the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to offer certain DPL
cottonseed lines containing Syngenta's traits (the "VipCot Assets") to Syngenta.  Under the
proposed Final Judgment, Monsanto cannot satisfy the required divestiture of the VipCot Assets
without the United States first approving the terms of the licenses pursuant to which Monsanto
offers Syngenta the assets.  Since May 31, 2007, the United States had numerous discussions
with Monsanto and Syngenta regarding the terms of these licenses.  On August 27, 2007,
Monsanto and Syngenta entered into an interim Material Transfer and Use Agreement to
facilitate transfer of VipCot traited cottonseed to Syngenta for further development prior to
Monsanto providing final licenses that meet the terms of the proposed Final Judgment.  Pursuant
to that agreement, Monsanto delivered to Syngenta certain seeds that the proposed Final
Judgment requires Monsanto to offer to Syngenta.  After obtaining approval from the United
States, Monsanto, on November 27, 2007, offered to Syngenta the licenses required by the
proposed Final Judgment.

<p><a name="10"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="3"><strong><li>Third Party License Modifications</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Section VI of the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to revise certain third-party
cottonseed licenses and gives the United States sole discretion to approve the proposed revisions. 
The United States engaged in continuing negotiations with Monsanto to ensure that the revisions
satisfied the terms of the proposed Final Judgment.  On November 15, 2007, Monsanto, pursuant
to Section VI.B. of the proposed Final Judgment, provided to the United States for its approval
copies of the modified licenses Monsanto intended to offer to third party seed companies; the
United States approved the modified licenses on November 20, 2007.  Monsanto then provided
to the licensees the offers containing the modified license language.  The offers remain open until
March 31, 2008.

<p><a name="11"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="4"><strong><li>Filing of Public Comments</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	During the 60-day public comment period called for by the Tunney Act, the United States
received comments from the following eleven organizations and groups:  the American Antitrust
Institute ("AAI"); Attorneys General of Virginia, Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia
(the "States"); California Consumers United ("CCU"); E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
("DuPont"); the Illinois Stewardship Alliance ("ISA"); the International Center for Technology
Assessment/Food Safety ("ICTA"); a comment signed by the president of Plains Justice, the
president of the Women, Food, and Agriculture Network, and the president of the Iowa Farmers
Union ("Plains Justice"); a comment signed by a group of Texas cotton gins and other
cotton-based associations ("Texas Cotton Associations"); the Ohio Farmers Union ("OFU"); the
Organization for Competitive Markets ("OCM"); and the Wisconsin Farmers Union (WFU").

<p>	The criticisms offered by the Commenters generally fall into four areas:  (1) the
appropriate standard of review; (2) the sufficiency of the divestiture to preserve competition in
the relevant markets; (3) the workability of the remedy; and (4) purported competitive harms  not
alleged in the Complaint.  Upon careful review, the United States believes that nothing in the
comments warrants any changes to the proposed Final Judgment or is sufficient to suggest that
entry of the proposed Final Judgment is not in the public interest.  We address these issues below
and explain why the criticisms raised in the comments are not valid.

<p>    

<p><a name="12"></a><ol type="I" start="3"><strong><li>The Standards Governing the Court's Public Interest Determination</li></strong>

<p><a name="13"></a><ol type="A"><strong><li>The Appropriate Legal Standard</li></strong></ol></ol>	

<p>	As discussed in detail in the Competitive Impact Statement (at 23-27), the Court, in
making the public interest determination called for by the Tunney Act, is required to consider
certain factors listed in the Act relating to the competitive impact of the judgment and whether it
adequately remedies the harm alleged in the complaint.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
  This public interest inquiry is
necessarily a limited one as the United States is entitled to deference in crafting its antitrust
settlements, especially with respect to the scope of its complaint and the adequacy of its remedy. 
<em>See generally</em> <em>United States v. Microsoft Corp</em>., 56 F.3d 1448, 1458-62 (D.C. Cir. 1995); <em>United
States v. SBC Commc'ns</em>, 489 F.Supp.2d 1, 12-17 (D.D.C. 2007).

<p>	With respect to the scope of the complaint, the Tunney Act review does not provide for
an examination of possible competitive harms the United States did not allege.  <em>See, e.g.,</em>
<em>Microsoft</em>, 56 F.3d at 1459 (stating that the district judge may not "reach beyond the complaint to
evaluate claims that the government did <em>not</em> make").<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
  The reviewing court may look beyond the
scope of the complaint only when the complaint has been "drafted so narrowly as to make a
mockery of judicial power."<em>  SBC Commc'ns</em>, 489 F.Supp.2d at 14.  That is not the case here as
the Complaint properly alleges the harm the transaction is likely to cause in the relevant product
and geographic markets.  Indeed, multiple commentors recognized the sufficiency of the
Complaint:  The States, for example, note that "the United States acknowledges the significant
anticompetitive effects that the acquisition will have on the development, production and
distribution of cotton biotech traits and seeds."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
 DuPont similarly states that "the Complaint
filed by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division details the serious harm to farmers and
consumers that will result," and further acknowledges that the "Complaint sets forth a clear and
compelling story of the competitive injury that will result from the proposed transaction."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>


<p>	With respect to the sufficiency of the proposed remedy, a district court must accord due
respect to the United States's views of the nature of the case, its perception of the market
structure, and its predictions as to the effect of proposed remedies.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>SBC Commc'ns</em>, 489
F.Supp.2d at 17 (United States entitled to "deference" as to "predictions about the efficacy of its
remedies"); <em>see also</em> CIS at 24-26.  Under this standard, the United States "need only provide a
factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged
harms."  <em>SBC Commc'ns</em>, 489 F.Supp.2d at 17.  DuPont, referencing the Division's review of
Monsanto's abandoned attempt to purchase DPL in 1998, suggests that the "government has an
extra burden . . . when it changes its view on an identical transaction."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>
  But the assertion finds
no support in the language of the statute or the caselaw.  This is not surprising given that it
contravenes long-established precedent holding that a prosecutor's exercise of discretion carries
no estoppel effect.  Moreover, DuPont's position would inappropriately require the court to
engage in extensive fact finding of historical events &#8212; in essence, a trial within a trial &#8212; simply to
determine whether the two transactions were in fact "identical" and whether the government
accepted a less effective remedy than it would have the first time.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>


<p><a name="14"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>The Appropriate Inquiry Is Whether the Remedy Preserves Competition,
Not Whether It Replicates DPL</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Some of the commentors criticize the remedy, particularly the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets divestiture, for not creating a competitor that mirrors DPL in scope and independence.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
But they pose the wrong standard for evaluating the effectiveness of the remedy.  Because the
antitrust laws seek to protect competition, the purpose of the remedy is not to recreate DPL but to
preserve the competition that DPL brought to the market &#8212; to ensure that cotton farmers continue
to realize the competitive benefits they would have had but for the merger.

<p>	Thus, the key questions in evaluating the remedy are: (1) Does it ensure that farmers will
continue to benefit from competition to develop, commercialize and sell cottonseed in the
MidSouth and Southeast?, and (2) Does it preserve the likely benefits to competition that would
have arisen from development of cottonseed for the MidSouth and Southeast containing
non-Monsanto traits?  The proposed remedy does both, as we explain in more detail below. 

<p>	For some commentors, however, no remedy would suffice for this transaction or even any
other potential acquisition of DPL.  They essentially argue not only that the sole effective remedy
in this case would be to block the transaction outright but that DPL must be kept as it is &#8212;
independent of any trait provider &#8212; in perpetuity, available at any time for partnership with any
trait provider that chooses to work with it.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
  This is a extraordinary proposition, and it is wrong. 
It relies on a static view of the market, presuming that DPL is essential to a competitive traited
cottonseed market; it discounts the incentives and abilities of others, such as Bayer and Syngenta,
to compete; it ignores market facts, such as Stoneville's efforts and growing success in the
MidSouth and Southeast; and it would deny DPL and consumers the efficiencies that would come
from vertical integration with a trait provider (evidenced by the significant number of seed
companies that are vertically integrated into trait development).

<p>	In short, the remedy, when considered in light of the applicable legal standard and the
appropriate inquiry, satisfies the public interest requirements set forth in the Tunney Act. 


<p><a name="15"></a><ol type="I" start="4"><strong><li>Response to Comments Criticizing the Sufficiency of the Remedy</li></strong></ol>

<p>	Several commenters offer criticisms regarding the sufficiency of particular aspects of the
remedy.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
 Before addressing these criticisms, it is important to note that the remedy should be
evaluated as a whole.  It is not necessary that each asset included within the remedy package, on a
stand-alone basis, sufficiently preserves competition.  Rather, the key determination is whether, as
directed by the proposed Final Judgment, the entire remedy maintains competition for the
development, commercialization and sale of traited cottonseed in the relevant markets.  The
remedy here accomplishes this goal by bringing together:

<p><ul><li>					 		An ongoing, historically successful cottonseed company, Stoneville, that
has sold cottonseed in the MidSouth and Southeast since 1922, and in which
Monsanto has recently invested heavily;

<p>	<li>				 		Changes in Stoneville's trait licenses with Monsanto that give the
purchaser of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets terms similar to those held by DPL;

<p>	<li>				 		All of Monsanto's ongoing germplasm enhancement efforts that supported
its internal predictions of substantial Stoneville market share growth over the next
five years;

<p>		<li>			 		Eight DPL elite conventional breeding lines that serve as the germplasm
source for approximately 60% of DPL's sales in the MidSouth and Southeast;

<p>		<li>			 		Twelve DPL elite conventional breeding lines that DPL anticipated would
be the germplasm source for its next generation of traited seed in the MidSouth
and Southeast; 

<p>	

<p>	<li>		 The requirement that the purchaser of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets be capable of and
committed to using the assets to compete for traited cottonseed sales in the relevant
markets;

<p>		<li>			 		Divestiture to Syngenta of the VipCot development work to prevent any
significant delay in bringing cottonseed with non-Monsanto traits to the
marketplace; and 

<p>		<li>			 		Changes in Monsanto's trait license agreements with other cottonseed
companies to allow them, without penalty, to stack non-Monsanto and Monsanto
traits and to sell cottonseed that includes non-Monsanto traits.</ul>

<p>This far-reaching remedy does not depend on the future success of each and every one of its
components.  Even if some component of the remedy were to fall short of expectations &#8212;  <em>e.g.</em>, one
of the next-generation DPL lines fails to continue exhibiting the high performance characteristics
that it has exhibited thus far &#8212; it would not jeopardize the efficacy of the remedy.  Taken as a
whole, there is no question that the remedy satisfies its goal of curing the competitive harms
alleged in the Complaint.  Nevertheless, we respond below to commentors' particular concerns.

<p><a name="16"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Divestiture of the Stoneville Business Unit and Monsanto Germplasm Provide
the Acquirer a Firm Foundation on Which to Compete in the MidSouth and
Southeast Markets</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Some commenters claim that Stoneville will not provide the acquirer of the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets with an adequate foundation on which to compete against Monsanto/DPL.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

Stoneville, however, is an ongoing business, which has operated in the relevant markets for over
80 years and has significant capabilities and growth potential.  It offers high quality germplasm
and has a strong developmental pipeline.  Its divestiture, coupled with additional cotton
germplasm from Monsanto's breeding programs, will provide the principal acquirer &#8212; Bayer &#8212; a
well-developed infrastructure and significant germplasm assets.

<p><a name="17"></a><ol><ol><ol><li>Stoneville Infrastructure</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p> 	When Monsanto acquired Stoneville in 2005, Stoneville was a freestanding cottonseed
company with a strong breeding program, as well as a national sales and marketing force.  These
existing assets had been sufficient to position Stoneville as a national provider of traited
cottonseed &#8212; second only to DPL in the MidSouth and Southeast.  As described above, Monsanto
nonetheless took several steps to enhance Stoneville's breeding capabilities.  With these
investments, Stoneville is poised for significant growth, as reflected by Monsanto's internal
projections.   

<p>	DuPont nevertheless suggests that Stoneville's lack of viability as an ongoing business is
evidenced by trait developers choosing not to work with Stoneville between 1999 and 2005, when
Stoneville was independent of Monsanto.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
  In making this argument, DuPont fails to note the
fundamental reason why trait companies, including DuPont, chose not to work with Stoneville;
namely, that under Stoneville's licenses with Monsanto at that time, Stoneville could not stack a
non-Monsanto trait with a Monsanto trait.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
  Similarly, Stoneville was likely to be reluctant to
provide a platform for an unproven trait because the terms of its Monsanto licenses became less
lucrative if it worked with a non-Monsanto trait (<em>e.g.</em>, it received a smaller share of the trait fee
collected by Monsanto from farmers).  In contrast, DPL could freely work with non-Monsanto
traits, including stacking them with Monsanto traits, without risking reduction in its fee share or
losing its Monsanto trait license altogether.  The Enhanced Stoneville Assets include trait licenses
from Monsanto that are comparable to those held by DPL pre-merger, and free of the restrictions
that previously existed in Stoneville's licenses.

<p>	 DuPont also claims that the divestiture is insufficient in that it does not provide the
acquirer enough breeding stations, comparing DPL's eleven global breeding stations with
Stoneville's two breeding stations.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
  That comparison, however, is misleading.  Though DPL has
eleven breeding stations worldwide, only five develop varieties for the MidSouth and Southeast. 
The divestiture includes the two breeding facilities that Stoneville used for developing MidSouth
and Southeast varieties,<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
 and Bayer has two additional breeding stations located in those regions,
bringing Bayer's total to four after the divestiture.  Accordingly, as a result of the sale of
Enhanced Stoneville assets to Bayer, DPL-Monsanto and Bayer will have breeding infrastructures
similar in size and scope focused upon developing varieties suited for the MidSouth and
Southeast.

<p><a name="18"></a><ol><ol><ol start="2"><li>Monsanto/Stoneville Germplasm</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	The remedy provides the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets all U.S. Stoneville
cotton germplasm, as well as germplasm from Monsanto's Advanced Exotic Yield and Marker
Assisted Breeding programs.  For various reasons, commentors fail to understand the significance
of these divestitures. 

<p><a name="19"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a"><li>The Breeding Process</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Much of the criticism results from lack of familiarity with the cottonseed breeding process. 
To address that deficiency, we provide below a short primer on cottonseed development.

<p>	There are two breeding stages in the development of quality, traited cottonseed.  Breeders
first develop elite conventional (nontraited) lines and, from those, they proceed to develop
commercial traited varieties.  In developing an elite conventional line, the breeder begins by
crossing two elite lines that the breeder anticipates will produce quality offspring.  The result of
that cross will be many progeny plants with differing characteristics.  The breeder then evaluates
and selects some subset of the progeny as promising enough to continue in the breeding process. 
In the greenhouse, the breeder then self-pollinates the progeny plant (<em>i.e.</em>, crosses the plant with
itself), evaluates its progeny, and makes further selections.  This process is typically repeated four
times in the greenhouse as the breeder continues to make selections based on observable plant
characteristics.  Promising lines then are grown in the field and subjected to additional testing. 

<p>	At the end of this process, which takes approximately six years, the finished line can take
either or both of two paths.  If the seed company intends to commercialize the line as a
conventional variety, the company will subject the line to an additional year of field trials and then
over the course of the next two years "bulk" the line up for commercial sale.  If the seed company
intends to use the finished line as a traited variety, the seed company will subject the line to a
separate procedure.  The finished line (the "recurrent parent") will first be crossed with a donor
plant that contains the desired trait to introduce or "introgress" the trait into the recurrent parent
line.  After that initial cross, progeny plants are selected on the basis of agronomic characteristics
and the presence of the trait.  Those plants are then typically "backcrossed" with the recurrent
parent, which involves pollinating the plants with pollen from the recurrent parent.  Backcrossing
brings the plant closer to the genetics of the recurrent parent, except that the trait is now present. 
Breeders typically backcross three to five times.  Once the backcrossing is completed, the seed
company puts the resulting traited seed through a period of increased testing and eventually
bulking up for commercialization.  Limited quantities of a traited variety from that recurrent
parent will be commercially available approximately five years after the recurrent parent is
available for breeding.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>

<p><a name="20"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="2"><li>Stoneville Germplasm</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	The proposed Final Judgment provides the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets
with all of Stoneville's U.S. germplasm.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>
  DuPont, however, questions the likelihood that the
varieties in Stoneville's development pipeline will be successful.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
  The evidence, however, shows
the strength of the pipeline and, as Monsanto itself had predicted, its strong likelihood of
commercial success.   

<p>	Stoneville has over fifty lines in its pipeline for possible commercialization in the
MidSouth and Southeast between 2008 and 2012.  Stoneville's pipeline is the product of its
traditional focus on mid- to full-season varieties found in the MidSouth as well as a more-recent
sustained and intensive research effort to develop germplasm suitable for the Southeast.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>

Stoneville has historically been more successful at capturing sales in the MidSouth than in the
Southeast (as evidenced by its 2006 share of 16% share in the MidSouth versus 8% in the
Southeast) because its breeding program had focused primarily on varieties harvestable early in
the growing season.  When Emergent Genetics ("Emergent") acquired Stoneville in 1999,
however, it saw the Southeast as a lucrative growth area and began taking steps to increase
Stoneville's efforts to breed mid- to full-season varieties (<em>i.e.</em>, varieties better suited to the longer
growing season afforded in the more southern growing areas).  To this end, in 2001 Emergent
acquired Helena Chemical's breeding program, which included germplasm lines suited for the
Southeast.  In addition, Emergent established a breeding station in Arizona with the specific
mission of breeding mid- and full-season varieties.  

<p>	When Monsanto acquired Stoneville in 2005, it continued these efforts to breed varieties
suitable for the Southeast, significantly increasing the number of testing plots and aggressively
using counter-season production to accelerate the introduction of full-season varieties.  According
to Monsanto's internal field tests, conducted prior to entering the agreement to acquire DPL,
several of Stoneville's lines are performing in yield trials on par with DPL's most successful
varieties in the MidSouth and Southeast, DP555 and DP444.  Indeed, Monsanto anticipated that
its efforts to improve Stoneville's breeding program would result in Stoneville gradually
increasing its national share from 13% in 2006 to nearly 20% by 2010 (this estimate did not
include the likely share increases that would stem from germplasm being developed by Monsanto
outside of Stoneville that the proposed Final Judgment also requires to be divested).<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

<p><a name="21"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="3"><li>Additional Monsanto Germplasm</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>		

<p>	The proposed Final Judgment also requires Monsanto to divest cotton lines from its
valuable internal research and development efforts &#8212; the Advanced Exotic Yield lines and the
Marker Assisted Breeding ("MAB") populations &#8212; regardless of whether Monsanto considered
those lines to be part of Stoneville.  In this way, the remedy ensures that the acquirer has the
breadth of Monsanto's cottonseed development programs that would have been used to compete
against DPL absent the transaction. 

<p><a name="22"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol type="i"><li>Advanced Exotic Yield Lines</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>		

<p>	DuPont implicitly criticizes the inclusion of the Advanced Exotic Yield Lines in the
divestiture package, suggesting that because the CIS describes the value of these developmental
lines as "promising," the lines likely will be of little commercial value to the acquirer of the
Enhanced Stoneville Assets.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
 Although Monsanto started its Advanced Exotic Yield program as
a means of identifying traits in exotic cotton plants that would increase yields when bred into
more traditional commercial lines, that program also resulted in the creation of finished elite lines
that have achieved significantly better yields in field tests than the current leading varieties in the
MidSouth and Southeast.  As noted in the CIS, Monsanto planned to bring the first traited
varieties from these lines to market by 2009.  Monsanto forecasted that these traited varieties
would be a significant driver of market share for Stoneville.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

<p>	AAI suggests that the acquirer will have little incentive to commercialize these varieties
because they contain Monsanto traits.  The comment offers no explanation of why the acquirer
would forgo a significant profit opportunity by abandoning germplasm that appears to have
significant advantages relative to competing germplasm that also contains Monsanto traits.  In any
case, Bayer has already publicly touted its acquisition of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets as
including "access to additional high performing cotton products with insect-resistant and
herbicide-tolerant Monsanto traits."<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>	AAI also contends that many of the Advanced Exotic Yield Lines "are of extremely
limited value to the acquirer" because they already contain Monsanto traits and "[ b]reeding out
Monsanto traits and then breeding in competing traits will take a long time."<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
 AAI's criticism,
however, reflects a misunderstanding of the value of the lines and the various methods by which
the acquirer can use them.  In the near term, the acquirer can commercialize varieties from the
Advanced Exotic Yield Lines that currently contain Monsanto traits.  Sales of such varieties likely
would be important for the acquirer in growing Stoneville's market share.  In the medium and
longer terms, the acquirer can use the lines as breeding stock to introduce varieties containing, in
whole or in part, non-Monsanto traits.  It can do this by two different methods.  First, it could
simultaneously breed out any Monsanto traits that are not desired while breeding in new traits. 
Under this method, it could use any of the lines, including the four recurrent parents,<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
 as a parent
in crosses that ultimately result in commercial varieties containing the desired traits, including
varieties containing only non-Monsanto traits.  Such a process could be carried out within the five
year time horizon during which DPL anticipated it could bring non-Monsanto traited seed to
market.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
  Under the second method, which would take additional time, the acquirer could breed
out the Monsanto traits to make new conventional lines<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
 and then use those conventional lines as
breeding stock to launch varieties containing non-Monsanto traits.  

<p>	Commenters' concerns regarding the rights retained by Monsanto to the Advanced Exotic
Yield Lines also lack merit.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
 The rights retained by Monsanto to these lines merely allow
Monsanto to continue a trait research program that, if successful in identifying a yield trait that
could be introgressed into cotton varieties, would significantly benefit cotton farmers.  Moreover,
the proposed Final Judgment makes clear that, whether or not its research program is successful,
Monsanto cannot encumber in any way the acquirer's use of the Advanced Exotic Yield Lines.  

<p><a name="23"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol type="i" start="2"><li>MAB Populations</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	AAI and DuPont question the value of the MAB lines to the acquirer of the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets, pointing to language in the CIS which states that some of the MAB lines
contain Monsanto's traits.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
  In essence, such comments suggest that the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets divestiture is only effective as a remedy to the extent the divestiture gives the acquirer
access to conventional cotton lines.  Since the acquirer would need to breed Monsanto's traits out
of some of the MAB lines to create non&#8212;Monsanto traited lines, the commenters conclude that the
competitive value of the MAB lines to the acquirer is limited in the near term and at most
questionable in the longer term.  That conclusion is incorrect.

<p>	Monsanto's MAB cotton program involved identifying genetic markers for important
agronomic characteristics in the progeny resulting from the cross of two elite lines.  The goal of
the MAB program was two-fold.  First, breeders could use these markers to make better informed
selections from the progeny plants and could thereby produce a variety that likely was
agronomically superior to, and bred more quickly than, a variety derived from traditional breeding
selection methods.  Monsanto anticipated that commercial varieties from the MAB program
would become available as early as 2012.  Second, and in the longer term, a large library of such
genotypic information would offer breeders the ability to make better decisions about what elite
varieties to cross in the first instance.  Accordingly, divesting the MAB Populations and the
accompanying molecular mapping data provides the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets
with germplasm and genetic information that will enhance its offerings over the medium term and
provide a significant informational foundation for successful competition over the longer term. 

<p>	With respect to the specific concern that the MAB populations are of little value to the
acquirer because some contain Monsanto traits, the AAI overstates the scope of the limitation
articulated in the CIS.  While many of the MAB Populations are based on a cross involving a
parent that contains a Monsanto trait, approximately 37% of them are not.  Moreover, as
explained above, the time line for creating and commercializing conventional versions from lines
containing Monsanto traits, or creating versions containing traits other than Monsanto's, is
approximately five years.

<p><a name="24"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>Additional DPL Germplasm Provides Important and Meaningful Value</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Given the growth projections in Monsanto's business documents, the Stoneville
germplasm combined with the Monsanto Advanced Exotic Yield and MAB cottonseed lines
arguably would be sufficient to enable the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets to compete
effectively against DPL cottonseed.  However, the proposed Final Judgment seeks to further
ensure effective competition by supplementing the Monsanto assets with certain key DPL
germplasm lines consisting of 20 lines representing the pedigrees of many of DPL's popular
current varieties in the MidSouth and Southeast as well as a significant portion of DPL's breeding
pipeline for these areas.  Commenters had several concerns regarding these 20 lines,<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
 which we
address below. 

<p><a name="25"></a><ol><ol><ol><li>The DPL germplasm is of high quality</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Some commenters question whether the 20 DPL lines will produce competitive traited
varieties.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
  The United States used two methods to select the 20 lines, both of which were
designed to identify the lines that had the greatest chance of commercial success in the MidSouth
and the Southeast.  First, the United States looked to the germplasm in the pedigrees of the DPL
varieties currently performing best in the MidSouth and Southeast (based on total sales).  The
eight divested DPL lines that fall into this germplasm category<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
 are prevalent in the pedigrees of
the DPL varieties most successful in the MidSouth and Southeast today; five of these lines<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>
 are
the recurrent parents of the DPL varieties accounting for about 60% of DPL's 2006 cottonseed
sales in the Southeast &#8212; the growing region where DPL holds the greatest share advantage.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>
  Any
of these lines could be used immediately as a recurrent parent for a traited variety, as well as for
breeding stock for developing new elite lines.  

<p> 	Second, the United States examined what germplasm DPL was counting on for its future
seed sales, recognizing that breeding programs are not static.  Thus, the other twelve DPL lines
included in the divestiture package &#8212; even though not currently offered for sale or found in the
pedigrees of current bestsellers &#8212; were selected because DPL gave them the highest rating of the
select group of lines that it had in the pipeline for trait introduction in its MidSouth and Southeast
breeding programs.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
  DPL had in fact already introgressed Syngenta's VipCot trait &#8212; the
foundation of DPL's effort to move away from Monsanto &#8212; into these lines, revealing DPL's
confidence that they were most likely to produce high yielding varieties suitable for the MidSouth
and Southeast.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
 These lines would likely have been the source for any non-Monsanto traited
varieties that DPL would have brought to market in the MidSouth and Southeast from 2012 to
2016.  Because these lines are finished elite lines, any competent breeder (such as the breeding
personnel at Stoneville and Bayer) could have traited versions of any of these lines ready for
commercialization within approximately the next five years, <em>i.e.</em>, within the same time frame that
DPL could bring a non-Monsanto herbicide-tolerant seed to market.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
 

<p>	Finally, some commenters opine that the mere fact that this germplasm has not yet been
tested in the marketplace inherently diminishes its value.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>
  As discussed above, the divested
material is hardly of unpredictable quality.  The twelve lines of DPL germplasm were selected
precisely because those lines' superior performance had already been observed and relied upon by
DPL's breeders.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>
  DPL was developing the next generation of germplasm that it planned to use in
connection with marketing non-Monsanto traits.  Divestiture of this germplasm will allow the
acquirer to continue these efforts and not rely solely on currently available material.

<p><a name="26"></a><ol><ol><ol start="2"><li>The acquirer will be able to use this germplasm effectively</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Some commenters suggest that it will take the acquirer anywhere from eight to fifteen
years to commercialize traited varieties from these 20 lines.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
  In fact, it should take far less time.  
Because all 20 of the DPL lines in the Enhanced Stoneville Assets are finished elite conventional
lines, they can be immediately used as a recurrent parent for a cross with a trait donor.  Assuming
competing traits are available to breed into them, traited varieties from these lines could reach the
market in approximately five years &#8212; the same general time frame in which DPL could have
introduced non-Monsanto traited varieties absent the merger.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>


<p>	Contrary to DuPont's suggestion,<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
 the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets will not
be at a disadvantage with respect to effectively using the DPL germplasm lines included in the
package.  The proposed Final Judgment specifically provides that the acquirer will receive
applicable performance data and other information.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>
 Such information transfers are a routine
practice in the seed industry when germplasm or seed companies are bought or sold (which also
occurs routinely) &#8212; the books, logs, and other documentation about a breeding line are transferred
with the line even if the breeder does not go to the new owner of the line.  These materials will
readily allow the Stoneville breeders to understand the work that has been done on these lines to
date and to move the lines forward in their breeding program.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>

<p>	The States also contend that "even post-acquisition, Monsanto retains the right to . . . 
preclude [the acquirer of the divested DPL lines from] us[ing] them with non-Monsanto cotton
biotech traits."  States Comments at 7.  Under the proposed Final Judgment, the acquirer of the
DPL lines can freely use them to create varieties that contain (a) solely non-Monsanto traits, (b)
Monsanto's Bollgard II and non-Monsanto herbicide tolerant traits, and (c) Monsanto's Flex,
non-Monsanto insect resistant traits and non-Monsanto herbicide tolerant traits.  The only
limitation regarding use of non-Monsanto traits is that for a period of seven years the acquirer
cannot commercialize varieties from the DPL lines that solely have Bollgard II, Flex and a
non-glyphosate cotton herbicide tolerant trait currently commercialized in cotton.  The only
non-glyphosate cotton herbicide tolerant trait currently commercialized in cotton is Bayer's
Liberty Link.  This limitation adds to Bayer's incentive to introduce a non-Monsanto glyphosate
tolerant cotton trait as a substitute for Monsanto's Flex.

<p><a name="27"></a><ol><ol><ol start="3"><li>Monsanto/DPL's use of the germplasm does not diminish its value to the
acquirer and provides farmers continued benefits</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Some commenters claim that the fact that Monsanto retained the right to continue working
with the DPL lines, so long as the commercialized variety contains Monsanto-only traits, means
that these lines have little value to the acquirer<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>
 and provides Monsanto an improper benefit.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>
First, to the extent that the DPL germplasm provides the acquirer of the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets with a variety that has strong agronomic characteristics, the acquirer will have every
incentive to market that product.  Indeed, rather than being reason for concern, Monsanto's desire
to retain rights to these lines is further indication of the value of this germplasm within DPL's
breeding program.

<p>	Second, the licensing back of the lines to Monsanto/DPL benefits cotton farmers.  For
example, if Monsanto did not have a license for the to-be-divested DPL lines that are recurrent
parents to existing DPL traited varieties (including DP555, which contains Monsanto's traits),
Monsanto would have to remove these varieties from the market, significantly limiting options for
cotton farmers.  Similarly, without such a license, Monsanto would have to discard any varieties
in DPL's developmental pipeline that have the divested lines as a recurrent parent, even if those
lines already contain only Monsanto's traits.  The commenters do not explain why competition
would be served by denying cotton farmers these varieties.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>


<p><a name="28"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="3"><strong><li>The Remedy Preserves Incentives and Opportunities for Effective Traited
Cottonseed and Trait Development Competition</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>	Commentors expressed concern about the opportunities for trait developers.  Those
concerns, however, are misplaced as discussed below.						

<p><a name="29"></a><ol><ol><ol><li>Syngenta will be able to effectively use the VipCot Assets</li></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Some commenters<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>
 express concern that certain provisions of the license agreements
accompanying the divestiture of the VipCot Assets will unnecessarily restrict Syngenta's use of
the assets.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>
  

<p>	As noted above, the development of Syngenta's VipCot trait in DPL seed was at an
advanced stage when Monsanto's acquisition of DPL was proposed.  The United States required
the divestiture of the most advanced of DPL's VipCot lines not to ensure that Syngenta could
replace Stoneville as a competitor against DPL &#8212; the Enhanced Stoneville Assets divestiture
addresses that harm &#8212; but to prevent any delay to VipCot's commercialization as a result of the
merger.  The terms of the proposed Final Judgment will provide Syngenta the rights it needs to
bring VipCot to market and, thus, fulfill the goal that the VipCot Assets divestiture is intended to
accomplish. 

<p>	As provided in the proposed Final Judgment, the divestiture of these 43 lines to Syngenta
offers several possible paths to market for this traited germplasm.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>
  Syngenta could start its own
seed company using this germplasm as a base &#8212; either on its own or via a joint venture &#8212; and make
sales of the traited seed directly to distributors or farmers.  Syngenta already operates soy and corn
seed companies in the United States and is one of the largest providers of cotton-related
herbicides and insecticides in the world.  Syngenta also is a partner with DuPont in a recently
formed joint venture called Greenleaf Genetics, which the companies established to out-license
the companies' proprietary corn and soybean genetics and biotechnology.  In addition, Syngenta
has the option of licensing the traited germplasm to other seed companies, such as Bayer, Dow
and Americot, which already have breeding and distribution programs in place.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>


<p>	The requirement in the proposed Final Judgment that a commercialized variety derived
from the VipCot Assets contain one of four listed Syngenta insect-resistant events is not unduly
restrictive.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>
  These are the four "versions" of the insect-resistant trait that Syngenta and DPL were
most confident could achieve commercial success in the near-to-medium-term.  This restriction,
therefore, is directly tied to the harm that divesting the VipCot Assets is designed to remedy;
namely, delay in the introduction of the VipCot traits that DPL and Syngenta had been positioning
to enter the market.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>
 It is unlikely that any new insect-resistant traits developed by Syngenta
other than VipCot would be available for more than a decade, and any such trait likely could in
any event be stacked with one of the four existing events consistent with the proposed Final
Judgment. 

<p><a name="30"></a><ol><ol><ol start="2"><li>The remedy will preserve opportunities for trait developers to market
non-Monsanto traits in competitive cottonseed</li></ol></ol></ol>	

<p>	Some commenters expressed concern that post-merger there will no longer be a sufficient
base of non-Monsanto controlled cottonseed to support future trait development.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
However, the
Enhanced Stoneville Assets divestiture provided for in the proposed Final Judgment establishes a
substantial future platform for cotton trait developers to use to reach farmers in the MidSouth and
Southeast.  In addition, the third party license changes required by the proposed Final Judgment 
promote the development and commercialization of competitive cottonseed with non-Monsanto
traits by giving cottonseed companies the ability to partner with trait developers other than
Monsanto without any financial penalty.  Currently, DPL seed accounts for approximately 43
percent of U.S. cottonseed acres, leaving over half of all U.S. cottonseed acres available to trait
developers who seek to compete against the merged Monsanto/DPL.  Commenters fail to explain
why this amount of acreage is insufficient, especially given the additional returns on investment in
cotton trait research that could be gained from Stoneville's likely growth in the MidSouth and
Southeast, possible cross-crop trait applications, and international cottonseed markets. 

<p>	With regard to the license changes, AAI suggests that Monsanto's trait licensing practices
should be addressed in a separate case, claiming that the required licensing modifications do not
help to remedy the loss of competition alleged in the Complaint.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
 To the contrary, the
modifications specifically address competition lost from Monsanto's acquisition of DPL, since
DPL's licenses did not limit its ability and incentive to work with non-Monsanto trait providers.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
These trait providers will now be able to work with cottonseed companies who previously had
restricted licenses.

<p><a name="31"></a><ol><ol><ol start="3"><li>The remedy should not &#8212; and does not &#8212; guarantee the introduction of
DuPont's OptimumGat trait</li></ol></ol></ol>	

<p>	Several commenters express concern that the remedy is insufficient because it does not
ensure that DuPont's OptimumGat trait will reach the market.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
 As discussed above, the proposed
remedy preserves the potential for the development and introduction of competing
herbicide-tolerant traits in the MidSouth and Southeast.  OptimumGat may prove to be such a
trait, but there was never any certainty of that even without the merger.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>
  Indeed, DPL was itself
exploring herbicide-tolerant trait alternatives with developers other than DuPont.  For example,
Bayer and Syngenta independently have been working on herbicide-tolerant traits for cotton that
could be commercialized on or before the time when DPL could have brought OptimumGat to
market absent the merger.  Thus, there was never any guarantee that OptimumGat would
ultimately be commercialized in cotton even if DuPont were able to continue working with an
independent DPL,<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
 and it would be inappropriate for an antitrust remedy to establish a guarantee
that the market would not have provided.

<p><a name="32"></a><ol><ol><ol start="4"><li>The remedy will preserve the number of "platforms" for trait development
that existed pre-merger</li></ol></ol></ol>	

<p>	Commenters suggest that because Bayer itself develops traits it will not work with other
trait developers and that the remedy thus fails to preserve trait development opportunities.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
 Even
if the claim were true, the competitive harm identified in the Complaint is still addressed: 
pre-merger, farmers in the MidSouth and Southeast looked forward to a choice between
Stoneville/Monsanto and DPL/non-Monsanto traited cottonseed; post-merger they still will have a
choice as they will look forward to competition between Stoneville/Bayer and DPL/Monsanto. 

<p>	It is important to bear in mind that DPL itself might not have continued to work with
multiple competing trait developers.  Contemporaneous DPL business documents indicate that
DPL likely would have selected only one non-Monsanto stack to bring to market in light of the
costs associated with breeding traited varieties, commercially distributing multiple varieties, and
managing the requirements and earning potentials of licences with trait developers.  Thus, DPL
likely would have chosen only <em>one</em> non-Monsanto insect-resistant trait and <em>one</em> non-Monsanto
herbicide-tolerant trait to promote.  It is also likely that DPL would have continued offering a
Monsanto stack because of the apparent market demand for Monsanto's traits.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>

<p>	In any event, Bayer has very strong incentives to use other third-party traits if those traits
are better than the traits it can develop on its own.  Indeed, Monsanto will have the same
incentive.  Competition from one will spur the other to try to offer the best product, regardless of
whether the included trait is developed in-house or licensed from a third-party.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>
 (And, it bears
remembering, such development of traits is, and would have been absent the merger, likely to
occur nearly a decade in the future.)  	

<p><a name="33"></a><ol type="I" start="5"><strong><li>Response to Comments that the Remedy Is Not Workable</li></strong></ol>	


<p>	A number of commenters posit that the remedy provided for in the proposed Final
Judgment is not in the public interest because the remedy is "conduct-based"<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>
 as opposed to 
"structural," and because the required divestitures have "strings attached," such as licenses
running between Monsanto and the acquirers of the divested assets.  These commenters further
assert that these provisions essentially render the remedy too costly to administer, or will require
too much ongoing involvement and policing by the United States or the Court to be effective.  As
explained below, the proposed Final Judgment provides an effective remedy that is clean and
certain (<em>i.e.</em>, consisting of one-time, well-defined events that do not involve costly government
regulation of the market), is consistent with the Merger Remedy Guide issued by the United
States,<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>
 and does not involve cumbersome monitoring by the United States or the Court. 

<p><a name="34"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>The Divestitures and License Changes Are One-Time Events, Not Ongoing
Behavioral Remedies</li></strong></ol></ol>	


<p>	The remedies proposed by the United States are one-time events calling for the divestiture
of identifiable and transferable assets and intellectual property as well as modifications to certain
licenses.  These are not conduct remedies that involve ongoing entanglement in market operations
or regulation of Monsanto's ongoing conduct.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>


<p>	Specifically, the proposed Final Judgment calls for the divestiture of Stoneville, an
ongoing cottonseed business that has been bought and sold on several occasions, including all of
Stoneville's domestic germplasm, breeding, and sales and marketing assets, together with the
information and intellectual property necessary to use those physical assets.  In addition to the
Stoneville business unit, the remedy calls for the divestiture of additional complementary assets,
<em>i.e.</em>, the 20 DPL cotton germplasm lines.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>
  The transfer of this package of assets is a one-time
event that constitutes a workable remedy to preserve competition and provides clear lines of
ownership, with Bayer owning outright the Stoneville business, as well as the 20 lines formerly
belonging to DPL.  In its basic structure, this remedy is not different from the commercial transfer
and licensing of germplasm and related intellectual property that occurs routinely in the
marketplace.

<p>	Some commenters suggest that aspects of the remedy involving licensing arrangements 
are unworkable conduct remedies that are inconsistent with the United States's policies on merger
remedies.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>
  The United States's Merger Remedy Guide, however, explains that proper merger
remedies can "involve the sale of physical assets" as well as the "sale or licensing of intellectual
property."<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>
  Licensing is routine in this industry, where companies often combine the work of
others (<em>e.g.</em>, germplasm, traits, intellectual property) with their own useful developments and
introduce better products for the market.  The licenses in this case were crafted so that each
company would know which rights it would retain after the divestiture to help ensure a workable
remedy. 

<p>	The divestiture of the VipCot Assets to Syngenta is also a workable remedy.  The
germplasm divestiture is accomplished though a license to Syngenta rather than absolute
ownership, but the method of transfer will not affect Syngenta's ability to compete effectively as
Syngenta will have a non-terminable and royalty-free license to use the divested lines.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>
  As
discussed above, the provisions in the proposed Final Judgment offer Syngenta several
alternatives for bringing the DPL germplasm to market, and entry of VipCot-traited varieties will
alter the structure of the traited cottonseed market regardless of the means selected.

<p>	Finally, the proposed Final Judgment's requirement that Monsanto modify existing
third-party licenses is also a one-time event.  The changes to these licenses require modification of
certain terms that will enable those third parties to work more readily with non-Monsanto trait
providers. 

<p><a name="35"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>Monitoring Compliance With the Remedy Will Not Unduly Burden the
United States or the Court</li></strong></ol></ol>	 


<p>	Contrary to some commenters' suggestions, the terms of the proposed Final Judgment do
not require cumbersome monitoring of the marketplace by the United States or the Court.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
 For
example, pointing to certain conditions and limitations placed on the germplasm to be divested
under the proposed Final Judgment, AAI asserts that the divestitures are a "conduct-based,
regulatory-style 'fix' that imposes on this Court a monitoring and compliance burden that it
should be loathe to undertake."<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>
  These criticisms grossly overstate monitoring issues associated
with the proposed Final Judgment.

<p>	As stated above, the asset divestitures and license modifications are one-time events that,
in fact, have already been accomplished in their entirety or have been implemented successfully in
significant part.  There remains, of course, the possibility that a dispute under one of the asset
purchase agreements or licenses will arise in the future.  Such a possibility exists in nearly every
case in which the United States requires divestitures.  As a general matter, such disputes would
not require intervention by the United States, as the parties to the dispute can rely on contract
procedures and other remedial steps to reach a resolution.  Accordingly, while the United States
will continue to monitor Monsanto's behavior to ensure compliance with the judgment, the
prospect of the United States and this Court becoming enmeshed in the types of disputes
enumerated by the commenters is both exaggerated and remote.

<p><a name="36"></a><ol type="I" start="6"><strong><li>Response to Comments that Raise Issues Beyond the Scope of the Court's
Review</li></strong></ol>

<p>	Several commenters express concerns about competitive issues not raised in the
Complaint.  As discussed above in Section III.A., issues beyond the scope of the Complaint are
outside the purview of the Court.  However, even if the Court were to consider the merits of these
alleged concerns, the United States appropriately concluded that permitting the transaction will
not give rise to the posited harms.  

<p><a name="37"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Crops Other Than Cotton</li></strong></ol></ol>	


<p>	Several commenters expressed concern that the merger will have a detrimental impact on
the development of traits for corn and soy.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>
 These commenters argue that a reduced revenue
opportunity in cotton will make trait producers hesitant to develop traits as they will have fewer
opportunities to profit from their investment.  Market conditions belie that prediction.

<p>	The revenue opportunities for corn and soy traits far exceed those for cotton, based on
available acres.  The market for biotech soy is more than four times greater than the market for
biotech cotton in the United States, and more than three times greater worldwide.  The market for
biotech corn is at least four times greater than that for cotton in the United States, and at least 1.3
times greater than that for cotton worldwide.  Within the United States, the combined market
opportunity to sell biotech soy and biotech corn is roughly 130 million acres, whereas there are
only 15 million cotton acres.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>
  That revenue opportunity has proven sufficient for DuPont to
continue its commercialization of OptimumGat in corn and soy and to continue research and
development of other transgenic traits<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>
 and likely would provide similar incentives for other trait
developers. 

<p><a name="38"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>Conventional Cottonseed</li></strong></ol></ol>	

<p>	ICTA suggests that the transaction will result in harm to a conventional cottonseed
market.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>
  The merger does not, however, substantially alter incentives of seed companies to offer
conventional varieties.  Absent the merger, DPL's share of the trait fee charged by Monsanto
reflected a significant share of DPL's revenues, and DPL's revenues from trait fees would have
become even larger as it shifted to non-Monsanto traits.  Accordingly, even without the merger,
DPL would have had substantial incentives to shift sales from conventional to traited seed so as to
earn these fees.  Further, ICTA fails to explain why, assuming there is a core set of farmers
committed to using conventional seed, Monsanto or Bayer would not continue to have sufficient
incentives to provide conventional seed to them.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>


<p><a name="39"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="3"><strong><li>The Southwest and West Traited Cottonseed Markets</li></strong></ol></ol>	

<p>	ICTA contends that the transaction will harm competition for traited cottonseed in the
Southwest and West regions of the United States.  A close examination of the facts reveals the
lack of support for ICTA's claim.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>

<p>	With respect to the Southwest,<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>
 DPL and Stoneville have a much smaller competitive
presence than they do in the MidSouth or Southeast, in large part because their germplasm is not
uniquely suited for the Southwest region.  As reflected by the 2006 market shares for traited
cottonseed in this region, there are a number of competing companies:  Bayer 46%; DPL 26%;
Stoneville 15% (Stoneville branded seed 5% and NexGen branded seed 10%); Americot 5%;
All-Tex 3%; UAP 3% and Croplan 1%.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>
  The divestiture of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets to
Bayer and Americot does not significantly alter the competitive situation.  Because Stoneville
developed its NexGen brand seed specifically for the Southwest market and Americot acquired
Stoneville's NexGen-related assets, the Southwest market will continue to have three seed
companies with significant shares (Bayer/Fibermax, Monsanto/DPL and Americot/NexGen) and
three additional companies with a smaller presence (All-Tex, Croplan, and UAP).

<p>	With respect to the West, a proper analysis must recognize that Arizona and California are
very different and relatively small markets.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>
 In California, nearly all of the cotton grown is either
pima or acala (a form of upland cotton).<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
  Stoneville does not sell pima or acala varieties.  Based
on 2006 market shares for traited upland varieties grown in California (which ignores the large
volume of pima cotton grown in California), Stoneville has only a 3% share, while Dow has a
43% share, Bayer 38%, DPL 13% and UAP 3%.  Accordingly, the transaction does not
significantly affect traited cottonseed competition in California.

<p>	Like the MidSouth and Southeast, the USDA data suggest there are two significant sources
of upland cottonseed in Arizona:  DPL with 73% and Stoneville with 20%.  Because the proposed
Final Judgment adequately addresses competition issues in the MidSouth and Southeast by
requiring divestiture of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets, it also resolves any potential issues for
Arizona.  Further, because Arizona's geography is well-suited for seed production of Southeast
and MidSouth varieties, a significant amount of the upland cotton planted in Arizona is grown by
farmers under contract with DPL and Stoneville for the purpose of producing cottonseed (rather
than cotton fiber).<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
  Thus, DPL's and Stoneville's shares in Arizona primarily reflect that they
perform a substantial amount of seed production there. 

<p><a name="40"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="4"><strong><li>Prices for Cottonseed Sold for Livestock Feed</li></strong></ol></ol>	

<p>	OFU predicts that prices paid for cottonseed used in livestock feed will increase due to the
merger.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>
  The comment appears to misunderstand the source of cottonseed used for feed.  Such
seed does not come directly from the cottonseed companies.  Rather, seed used for feed is the
by-product of the cotton production process.  The licensing agreements farmers sign in order to
plant transgenic seed prevent them from planting the seed from their crop; hence, they typically
sell any seed extracted from the cotton during the ginning process for oil or feed.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
  That seed
does not pass through the hands of a cottonseed company on its way to be sold as feed.  Nor does
the OFU explain how the merger would affect prices of cottonseed sold for feed.  Historically, the
price of cottonseed used as livestock feed has remained fairly stable even as the price of
transgenic planting seed has increased.  Over the past ten years the price of seed for feed has
averaged $107 per short ton, a fraction of what farmers pay per bag of transgenic seed.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>
Moreover, the price of cottonseed sold for feed is likely affected by other sources of livestock
feed.  Finally, even if the price paid by farmers for cottonseed for planting did affect the price of
feed cottonseed, since the proposed Final Judgment preserves traited cottonseed competition, the
merger should have no adverse impact on the price of feed cottonseed. 

<p><a name="41"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="5"><strong><li>Alleged Monsanto Exclusionary Business Practices</li></strong></ol></ol>	


<p>	The States contend that Monsanto will engage in exclusionary business practices
post-merger, such as "acquisitions of independent seed companies and germplasm providers to
enhance its monopoly position in both seed and traits; long-term, highly restrictive licensing
agreements that encourage the sale of Monsanto's biotech traits exclusively; licensing restrictions
that prevent independent seed companies from combining Monsanto biotech traits with
non-Monsanto traits; and bundling rebates on seeds, traits and chemicals to exclude competitors
from retail distribution channels."<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>


<p>	Given both the breadth and lack of specificity of this contention, it is difficult to discern
how it relates to the transaction at issue here.  The actions on the laundry list articulated by the
States are ones Monsanto could undertake with or without this merger, and the States do not
explain why the transaction would change Monsanto's incentive or ability to engage in them.  Nor
do the States explain why such actions, if designed to have an anticompetitve effect, would be
successful in light of the preservation of competition achieved by the required divestiture of the
Enhanced Stoneville Assets.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>


<p>	Furthermore, though the United States made no determination regarding the competitive
effect of certain business practices, some aspects of the proposed Final Judgment would make it
difficult for Monsanto to engage in certain of the purportedly anticompetitive practices suggested
by the States.  For example, the proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to remove
anti-stacking provisions in its licenses to other seed companies and penalties for working with
competing trait providers.  Also, it requires Monsanto to notify the United States in advance of
purchases of independent cottonseed companies and germplasm providers, affording an
opportunity to investigate and if necessary challenge any that might be anticompetitive.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>


<p>	Finally, and most fundamentally, the antitrust laws will continue to apply and would
proscribe conduct by Monsanto that runs afoul of applicable legal standards.

<p><a name="42"></a><ol type="I" start="7"><strong><li>Conclusion</li></strong></ol>

<p>	After careful consideration of the public comments, the United States remains of the view
that the proposed Final Judgment provides an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust
violation alleged in the Complaint and that its entry would therefore be in the public interest. 
Although the proposed Final Judgment, like any settlement, was a product of negotiation and
compromise,<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
 it fully achieved the United States's goals in this action.  Even if the court might
be inclined to view the issues differently, the purpose of Tunney Act review is not for the court to
engage in an "unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public"<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>
 or to determine
the relief "that will best serve society,"<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>
<p> it is simply to determine whether the proposed decree is
within the reaches of the public interest _ "even if it falls short of the remedy the court would
impose on its own."<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>


<p>	The Court is to consider "the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the
relevant market or markets, upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from
the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be
derived from a determination of the issues at trial."<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>
 Because the markets identified in the 
Complaint are the only ones in which competition is likely to be lessened as a result of the merger,
the impact of entry of the proposed Final Judgment will be to restore any competition lost as a
result of the merger.  Farmers in the MidSouth and Southeast who might have otherwise suffered
injury from the violation set forth in the Complaint will retain their current and prospective
competitive choices for traited cottonseed by virtue of the contemplated divestitures.  Based on
the factors set forth in the Tunney Act, the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. 

<p>	Pursuant to Section 16(d) of the Tunney Act, the United States is submitting the public
comments and its Response to the Federal Register for publication. Our response is also being
provided to each of the commenters.  After the comments and the United States's Response to
Comments are published in the Federal Register, the United States will move this Court to enter
the proposed Final Judgment.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>      	  The United States also spoke multiple times with representatives from the offices of the 
Attorneys General of 27 states interested in the progress of the United States's investigation,
including representatives of 16 of the 17 states where cotton is grown in the United States
(Georgia's office elected not to participate).  In this proceeding, thirteen states, representing less
than 20% of U.S. cotton production, have signed onto a comment (discussed <em>infra</em>) questioning
the proposed Final Judgment.  Of the states signing the comment, Delaware, Kentucky, Rhode
Island, Utah and West Virginia elected not to participate in any of the communications between
the United States and states's representatives during the United States's investigation. The
comment does not explain either the scope of the investigation, if any, those non-participating
states undertook to reach their conclusions or the reasons why none of the commenting states has
initiated independent legal action to enjoin the transaction.

<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>      	  Indeed, the United States concluded that, viewed as a whole, the transaction was likely
to create some efficiencies that could benefit consumers.  A Monsanto-DPL combination brings
together firms with complementary strengths and assets.  Monsanto has proficiency in transgenic
trait development, and DPL had expertise in cottonseed breeding.  Merging allows the two
programs to operate in tandem.  Through the integration of trait development and cottonseed
breeding, traited cottonseed could reach consumers faster and at lower cost.

<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>      	 <em> See</em> Complaint at 12-13.

<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>      	  Today, traited cottonseeds that contain only insect resistance account for less than 2% of
total traited acres. 

<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>      	<em>  See </em>Complaint at 2-3.

<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>      	  As discussed below, the relief provided by the proposed Final Judgment calls for
divestiture of 43 DPL lines containing VipCot.  The 43rd line included in the VipCot Assets is a
line that DPL acquired from Syngenta in 2006 that already contained VipCot.

<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>      	<em>  See </em>Complaint at 9-10.

<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>     	  The United States's investigation found that Bayer's efforts prior to the merger to
develop germplasm for the Southeast and MidSouth, if successful, would not likely bear fruit any
sooner than 2016.  Given the early stage of Bayer's breeding efforts in those geographic areas,
the United States did not rely on this as a source of potential entry.  In contrast, Dow has
developed some varieties suitable for the MidSouth and potentially the Southeast, which will
enter the market some time in the 2008 to 2011 time frame.  However, given limitations in its
current trait licensing agreements with Monsanto, it was unclear that entry of Dow varieties
would have a significant competitive effect in those markets.

<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>      	  With its dominance in traits, Monsanto might have recaptured any seed price reductions
through higher trait fees.

<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>      	  Because DPL would have had to combine VipCot with a Monsanto herbicide-tolerant
trait, Monsanto might have recaptured any reduction in fees for an insect-resistant trait through
increases in fees for Monsanto's herbicide-tolerant trait.

<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>      	  In addition to potentially new insect resistant and herbicide tolerant traits, there is
current transgenic trait research regarding, among other things, drought tolerance, nematode
resistence and yield. 

<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>     	   These other revenue opportunities arise from the fact that (a) many potential cotton
traits have applications across other crops, including corn and soy, that offer significantly more
revenue potential than cotton, (b) the demand for traited cottonseed outside the United States is
significant and growing, and (c) there is substantial cotton acreage within the United States in
regions other than the MidSouth and Southeast, namely the Southwest and West. 

<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>      	  The United States was already familiar with both Bayer and Americot's existing U.S.
cottonseed operations, having interviewed representatives of these companies on numerous
occasions and reviewed business documents provided by both companies during the
Monsanto/DPL investigation.

<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>      	  Bayer's willingness to commit such a large amount of capital to acquiring the assets also
tends to indicate Bayer's interest in using the Enhanced Stoneville Assets to create a viable
competitor to Monsanto/DPL.

<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>      	  Liberty Link makes cotton tolerant to glufosinate herbicides and is only available in
Bayer's FiberMax cottonseeds, which are primarily used in the Southwest where they perform
well. 

<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>      	  Upon acquiring Stoneville, Bayer publicly noted, "[t]he new germplasm and the
geographic reach of the Stoneville business East of Texas ideally complement Bayer's cotton
seed and trait business."  <em>See</em> May 31, 2007 press release, "Bayer CropScience agrees to acquire
US cotton seed company Stoneville for US-$310 million," available at
&lt;http://www.bayercropscience.com/bayer/cropscience/cscms.nsf/id/20070529_EN?open&amp;ccm=400&gt;.

<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>      	  In its submitted comments, DuPont specifically questions Bayer's ability to compete in
the MidSouth and Southeast, citing the fact that Bayer had not successfully penetrated those
markets in the past.  DuPont Comments at 18.  <em>See also</em> AAI Comments at 16.  However,
DuPont's claim merely highlights Bayer's prior difficulty in accessing or developing competitive
germplasm for these regions, rather than speaking to Bayer's ability to succeed once it has such
germplasm.  That Bayer can fully succeed when it has access to competitive germplasm is well
documented by its successful entry in the Southwest market.

<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>      	  Stoneville started its NexGen germplasm program to develop cottonseed adapted to 
growing conditions in the Southwest growing region.  Bayer's Fibermax and AFD brands also
have a significant presence in this region.

<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a>      	  The sale of divestiture assets during the pendency of the Tunney Act review of a
proposed final judgment is consistent with the United States's standard practice, as is permitting
closing of the transaction challenged in the Complaint.  The materials filed with the Complaint
included a Hold Separate and Preservation of Assets Stipulation, requiring the parties to maintain
certain assets separate after the close of the merger (in this instance, DPL's assets) until the
United States was assured that the acquirer or acquirers proposed by Monsanto for the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets would meet the standards set forth in the proposed Final Judgment (<em>i.e.</em>, the
acquirer was capable of operating a viable cottonseed business using the divested assets).  This
procedural setting allowed Monsanto and DPL to close their merger shortly after the Complaint
and Proposed Final Judgment were filed and to expeditiously complete the sale of the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets to Bayer and Americot, thereby ensuring that neither the Enhanced Stoneville
Assets nor DPL were held in competitive limbo during the pendency of the Court's review.

<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>      	  <em>See</em> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 16(e)(1)(A) &amp; (B).  The <em>Microsoft</em> court explained that a court making a
public interest determination under the Act should consider, among other things, the relationship
between the remedy secured and the specific allegations set forth in the government's complaint,
whether the decree is sufficiently clear, whether enforcement mechanisms are sufficient, and
whether the decree may positively harm third parties.  <em>Microsoft</em>, 56 F.3d at 1458-62.

<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>     	  Were a court to reject a proposed decree on the grounds that it failed to address harm not
alleged in the complaint, it would offer the United States what the Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit referred to as a "difficult, perhaps Hobson's choice," in that the United States would have
to either redraft the complaint and pursue a case it believed had no merit, or drop its case and
allow conduct it believed to be anticompetitive to go unremedied. <em> Microsoft, </em>56 F.3d at 1456.

<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>     	  States Comments at 6.  

<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>      	  DuPont Comments at 2 &amp; 19.

<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a>      	  DuPont Comments at 3.

<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a>     	  In fact, DuPont's factual premise is flawed.  Contrary to DuPont's suggestion, the fact
that Monsanto abandoned its initial proposed acquisition of DPL in the face of a threatened
enforcement action by the United States does not imply that no remedy would have been
acceptable to the United States in 1999.  Rather, it implies only that Monsanto was at that time
unwilling to agree to remedies deemed necessary by the United States.  

<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>      	 <em> See, e.g.</em>, States Comments at 7 ("divested Stoneville is not the equivalent of DPL");
WFU Comment at 1 (proposed remedy "does not even come close to replacing independent
DPL").

<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>     	<em>  See, e.g.</em>, States Comments at 7 ("[S]toneville has been divested to Bayer, a trait
development competitor of Monsanto.  Because of this, Stoneville can never duplicate DPL's
unique position as an independent cotton seed company that can use its successful and
high-quality germplasm to partner with several different biotech companies to develop viable
competitive alternatives to Monsanto's monopolies in traits."); OFU Comments at 1 (Enhanced
Stoneville Assets do "not take the place of an independent Delta and Pine Land").

<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>      	  <em>See</em> States Comments at 6-8; ICTA Comments at 6-8; AAI Comments at 8-16; DuPont

<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>       See DuPont Comments at 6, 13 and 14; OCM Comments at 2; States Comments at 4
and 7.

<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>   	  DuPont Comments at 15.  

<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>      	  DuPont further suggests that Stoneville's inferiority as a trait partner is evidenced by
Monsanto choosing to purchase DPL.  DuPont overlooks the important fact that DPL had a
pending lawsuit against Monsanto under which Monsanto faced a potential $2 billion liability. 
By purchasing DPL, Monsanto eliminated that liability.  Although not a merger-specific
efficiency, eliminating this potential liability provides an explanation for Monsanto's decision to
undertake the acquisition.  Monsanto's desire to resolve that litigation also contradicts ISA's
assertion that "the clear reason for Monsanto's acquisition of Delta is elimination of competition
in seeds."  ISA Comments at 1.

<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>    	  DuPont Comments at 15; <em>see also </em>States Comments at 3.

<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a>     	  Monsanto also used facilities in Georgia and North Carolina in part for cottonseed
development.  Because Monsanto used those facilities for development of several crops besides
cotton, and Monsanto included in the Enhanced Stoneville Assets the cottonseed-related tangible
assets kept at those sites, the United States did not require divestiture of the real property
supporting those facilities.

<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>    	  Breeding a traited variety from elite parents can take as little as four years or as long as
seven.  The seven year outer time frame can be reduced by several means, including: using
counter-seasonal breeding; using molecular markers to reduce the number of crosses used in
introgression and increase stages; using high quality germplasm as the trait donor; in the case of
creating a stacked variety, using a trait donor that contains both of the desired traits; limiting the
number of official variety trials prior to making the seed available for sale; and bringing a more
limited volume of seed to market in the launch year.  

<p><a name="N_35_">35. </a>      	  As discussed above, this includes all germplasm with the exception of the NexGen
varieties Americot acquired.

<p><a name="N_36_">36. </a>      	  DuPont Comments at 9-10.

<p><a name="N_37_">37. </a>      	  Full season varieties typically perform better in the Southeast than the early- to mid-
season varieties that excel in the MidSouth.  

<p><a name="N_38_">38. </a>      	  DuPont notes that Stoneville's share in the Southeast and MidSouth has been in decline
as evidence that its potential to compete in the future is not bright.  DuPont Comments at 14. 
However, because Emergent's and Monsanto's investments in Stoneville's breeding capabilities
are so recent, Stoneville's share declines do not accurately reflect Stoneville's potential.  In 2007,
Stoneville reversed the trend of declining share.  According to USDA's annual reports on cotton
varieties planted, Stoneville's breeding efforts are, as Monsanto predicted, beginning to produce
results.  From 2006 to 2007, Stoneville's share increased from approximately 13% to 15%
nationwide and from just over 8% to 11% in the Southeast.   

<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>     	  DuPont Comments at 11 and 15.

<p><a name="N_40_">40. </a>      	  Despite their origin in a trait research program, further breeding and commercialization
of these lines requires only traditional breeding techniques.

<p><a name="N_41_">41. </a>      	  Bayer, <em>Investor Handout, Q2 2007</em>, www.investor.bayer.de/user_upload/2747/. 

<p><a name="N_42_">42. </a>      	  AAI Comments at 13.

<p><a name="N_43_">43. </a>     	  One of the recurrent parents is a conventional line and can be used immediately for
breeding a variety that contains only non-Monsanto traits.  The other three recurrent parents were
originally created by crossing a variety containing Bollgard with an exotic variety and those
parents accordingly contain the Bollgard I trait.  If Bayer chooses, it can use these three parents
immediately to breed varieties that contain a stack of a non-Monsanto herbicide trait and
Bollgard II (breeding in Bollgard II does not require breeding out Bollgard I).

<p><a name="N_44_">44. </a>      	  Under this method, a breeder would cross an Advance Exotic Yield Line containing
Monsanto traits with a line that contains non-Monsanto traits.  The breeder can then select from
the progeny offspring that lack the Monsanto traits and advance those offspring through
traditional breeding methods to create the desired variety.

<p><a name="N_45_">45. </a>      	   Breeders can create a finished conventional line by crossing an Advanced Exotic Yield
Line containing Monsanto traits with a conventional line and then selecting progeny that lack
traits for further breeding.

<p><a name="N_47_">47. </a>      	  AAI Comments at 13; DuPont Comments at 11.

<p><a name="N_48_">48. </a>      	<em>  See </em>AAI Comments at 12; DuPont Comments at 12; and OCM Comments at 3.

<p><a name="N_49_">49. </a>      	  For example, DuPont raises questions about the process used in selecting these 20 lines. 
DuPont Comments at 12.  The AAI suggests that the chances of the government picking good
varieties is low.  AAI Comments at 13.

<p><a name="N_50_">50. </a>      	  Lines DP 5690, DP 491, DP 2156, DP 565, DP 5305, DP 5415, and Delta Pearl. 

<p><a name="N_51_">51. </a>      	  Lines AZ2099, DP 491, DP 565, DP 415, and Delta Pearl.  Delta Pearl is the recurrent
parent of DPL's wildly successful DP 555 BG/RR (which accounted for over 18% of all U.S.
cottonseed sales in 2007 and over 80% of total cottonseed sales in the Southeast in 2007). 
Dupont notes "the CIS does not disclose how many other DPL germplasm lines are represented
in the lineage of these currently popular varieties."  DuPont Comments at 12.  No other DPL
germplasm lines are represented in the lineage of the traited varieties derived from these five
lines.

<p><a name="N_52_">52. </a>      	  OCM's and AAI's representation that these eight lines reflect only 1% of cotton acreage
is based only on their share of sales when offered as conventional commercial varieties. OCM
Comments at 3; AAI Comments at 12.  However, the relevant statistic is the one cited above and
in the CIS; namely, the role these lines have had in fostering DPL's current share of <em>traited</em>
varieties in the MidSouth and Southeast. 

<p><a name="N_53_">53. </a>      	  The United States's investigation revealed that over the past several years DPL's
breeders have established a four-tier system for ranking the potential of germplasm the breeders
have under development.  From 2004 (when DPL set up the rating system) to 2007, only <em>fifteen</em>
lines across DPL's five MidSouth and Southeast oriented breeding stations received DPL's
highest internal ranking.  The ranks assigned by DPL reflect the results of extensive field testing. 
Under the proposed Final Judgment, twelve of those lines will go to the acquirer of the Enhanced
Stoneville Assets.   

<p><a name="N_54_">54. </a>     	  Similarly, in 2006 DPL attempted to introduce potential OptimumGat events into seven
DPL lines, hoping by that process to create a plant in which OptimumGat successfully imparted
herbicide tolerance.  While that attempt by DPL and DuPont failed to produce any potential
candidates for use as an OptimumGat donor parent, the fact that all seven of the lines used in that
experiment are among the twelve divested further demonstrates the high regard DPL had for
these lines.		

<p><a name="N_55_">55. </a>     	  Thus, AAI's criticism (p. 12) that the "acquirer is therefore obtaining only the raw inputs
necessary to breed varieties that could be commercially viable in the future and only after
considerable expenditure" is incorrect.

<p><a name="N_56_">56. </a>      	<em>  See, e.g.</em>, ICTA Comments at 7 ("Twelve of the 20 lines are experimental lines with
unproven and hence uncertain commercial potential.").

<p><a name="N_57_">57. </a>      	 In further support of its claim that 20 lines are insufficient, DuPont claims that "DPL
introduced 64 unique cotton varieties in the past eight years, but only 14 ever came to represent
1% or more of annual U.S. cottonseed acres."  DuPont Comments at 16.  The statistic, however,
is misleading.  One elite breeding line can result in multiple unique varieties in two independent
ways: varieties with the same recurrent parent can be differentiated based on their trait
composition; additionally, the process of introgressing a trait into a conventional elite parent may
yield multiple promising and distinctive progeny that have commercial potential.  For example,
Delta Pearl is the recurrent parent of five traited varieties introduced by DPL between 2000 and
2006 as well as being offered as a conventional variety.  Similarly, DP491 is the recurrent parent
of four traited varieties as well as being offered as a conventional variety.  Thus, divesting 20
lines provides the potential for many more than 20 commercial varieties.

<p><a name="N_58_">58. </a>      	  Several commenters, citing provisions in the Complaint (&#182; 15) and the CIS (at p. 16), 
provide time frames ranging from eight to fifteen years for how long it would take the acquirer to
bring traited varieties of the DPL germplasm to market.  <em>E.g.</em>, States Comments at 6 (8-10 years);
AAI Comments at 12 (10 years); and OCM Comments at 2 (8-15 years).   

<p><a name="N_59_">59. </a>     	  Commentors ignore the fact that DPL has already completed the bulk of the breeding
process on the divested lines (<em>i.e.</em>, the first six or seven years of making crosses and winnowing
progeny).  Commenters' citations to the Complaint and CIS are thus inapplicable.  <em>See</em> Complaint
&#182; 15 (referring to the time period for bringing a new variety to market from an initial cross of two
cotton lines &#8212; the divested lines are well past that stage) and CIS at 16 (referring to DPL using
the divested lines to bring varieties to market "over" the course of the next decade, not, as AAI
suggests, for at least another ten years).

<p><a name="N_62_">62. </a>     	  Bayer has already received this information from DPL in conjunction with the
divestiture of the 20 DPL lines.

<p><a name="N_63_">63. </a>     	  States Comments at 7 ("even post-acquisition, Monsanto retains the right to sell the
most popular seeds from those lines"); OAG at 3 (20 lines "is not even a true divestiture");

<p><a name="N_65_">65. </a>    	  ICTA's concern about the provision allowing DPL to sell conventional versions of the
DPL divested lines is also misplaced.  ICTA Comments at 4 ("DoJ has absolutely no basis for
proposing, or assessing the adequacy of the remedy cited above").  At the time the Complaint
was filed, the 2007 seed purchasing season was already under way and DPL was selling some of
the divested lines as conventional varieties.  Thus, the provision permitting DPL to continue to
sell these varieties in 2007 merely avoided disruption to farmers who wanted to buy these
conventional varieties for that season.

<p><a name="N_67_">67. </a>     	  The proposed Final Judgment requires Monsanto to divest to Syngenta 43 advanced
DPL germplasm lines traited with VipCot and related assets necessary to bring varieties from
these lines to market.  

<p><a name="N_68_">68. </a>     	  The United States has worked with Monsanto and Syngenta to ensure that the divestiture
(including access to any required licenses) is accomplished under terms that do not restrict
Syngenta's competitiveness and are commercially reasonable.  

<p><a name="N_69_">69. </a>    	  Of course, Syngenta also could license just the VipCot trait to seed companies if the
DPL-traited germplasm is not attractive to potential licensees or if Syngenta wished to keep the
DPL germplasm for its own branded seed product.

<p><a name="N_70_">70. </a>     	  <em>See</em> AAI Comments at 10.

<p><a name="N_71_">71. </a>     	  Contrary to the apparent perception of some commentors (<em>see, e.g.</em>, ICTA Comments at
8), this aspect of the proposed Final Judgment is not designed to ensure, by itself, an adequate
platform of high-quality germplasm for future trait developers.  The limitations on Syngenta's
use of the germplasm are appropriate to match this aspect of the remedy to its more-narrow
objective &#8212; preventing the merger from delaying VipCot's commercialization &#8212; and unrestricted
access to this germplasm is unnecessary in light of the other elements of the proposed Final
Judgment.

<p><a name="N_94_">94. </a>      	  ICTA notes that "40%" of the 36 conventional varieties planted in 2006 were DPL
varieties.  According to USDA 2006 data, DPL offered fifteen conventional varieties, with seven
of those fifteen having sales in the MidSouth and Southeast.  Six of those seven were divested to
Bayer as part of the Enhanced Stoneville Assets.

<p><a name="N_96_">96. </a>     	 Though the USDA classifies the Southwest as comprising Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas,
we have included New Mexico in our analysis of the region.  New Mexico has two distinct
cotton growing areas that can be roughly described as Eastern New Mexico and the Mesilla
Valley.  The same cotton varieties that grow successfully in Texas and Oklahoma are used in
Eastern New Mexico whereas acala varieties are primarily grown in the Mesilla Valley.  Because
the vast majority of cotton acreage in New Mexico is in the eastern region, we have included data
from that region in our analysis of the Southwest.

<p><a name="N_97_">97. </a>     	 The United States derived the above estimated shares of traited cottonseed sales in the
Southwest (including New Mexico for the reasons discussed above) from USDA data and other
data received during the course of the United States's investigation.  These shares discount
"saved seed" &#8212; conventional seed that a farmer saves from one year's crop to plant the next year
(a practice that is more prevalent in the Southwest than the other regions due to the greater use of
conventional seed which seed companies do not prohibit farmers from saving).  USDA data
ascribes saved seed to the seed company that originally produced the seed &#8212; even if the actual
sale of that seed occurred in a previous year &#8212; and thus significantly overstates branded seed
companies' shares in the region.

<p><a name="N_98_">98. </a>     	  As noted above, while classified by the USDA as part of the West, most of New
Mexico's cotton production occurs in the eastern part of the state and requires the same varieties
that perform well in the Southwest. 

<p><a name="N_99_">99. </a>     	 There are two species of cotton grown in the United States: pima and upland. 
Furthermore, there are different types of upland cotton grown in the United States.  In California,
most of the upland cotton grown are acala varieties.

<p><a name="N_100_">100. </a>     	 The USDA survey data does not distinguish between cotton grown primarily for seed
production and cotton grown as a crop.

<p><a name="N_102_">102. </a>     	  There would be excess seed even if farmers were able to replant transgenic seed because
an acre of cotton yields far more seed than is necessary to replant that acre.  

<p><a name="N_103_">103. </a>      	  USDA, <em>Oil Crop Situation and Outlook Yearbook</em>, May 2007, at 47. The price of
$107 per short ton translates to a price of $2.75 per 50 pound bag.  In contrast, a 50 pound
bag-equivalent of DP555BGRR would cost a farmer in Georgia roughly $130 for the seed alone,
plus an additional $292 for the trait fee.

<p><a name="N_107_">107. </a>      	  In this context, it is important to bear in mind that because Monsanto had committed to
selling Stoneville as a condition of its acquisition agreement with DPL, a challenge to the
acquisition by the United States would have had to overcome the adequacy of a Stoneville
divestiture to remedy any alleged harm.
