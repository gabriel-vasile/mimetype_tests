      <h3>Project Rationale</h3>
      <p>Two invasive predatory cercopagid cladocerans, <i>Cercopagis pengoi</i> and <i>Bythotrephes
        longimanus</i>, are recognized as potential "disruptive" factors in
        Great Lakes food webs. Cercopagids may, for example, divert energy
        away from the early life history stages of fishes, and thus limit the
        recruitment potential of fishes (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3 </a>). Potential
        mechanisms that cause these effects include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The direct reduction of zooplankton abundance ("lethal" or "density" effects)</li>
        <li> The indirect modification of the zooplankton prey phenotype ("nonlethal" or "traits-mediated" effects)</li>
      </ol>
      <p> Implications of density effects on fish recruitment are obvious, less
        obvious are nonlethal (trait-mediated) effects; cercopagid-induced changes
        in diel vertical distribution and activity of zooplankton could:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reduce growth rate and thus density of zooplankton</li>
        <li>Shift zooplankton to areas where they are less (or more) vulnerable
          to fish</li>
      </ol>
      <p><img src="../Images/2004/aispeacor04-1f3.jpg" alt="Kevin Pangle pumping for zooplankton" width="200" height="202" hspace="4" vspace="5" align="right">It is becoming increasingly recognized that such nonlethal effects can
        contribute substantially to the net effects of predators in aquatic systems.
        In fact behavioral responses of zooplankton are well studied, but the
        effects on species fitness and interactions are not. To fully understand
        and model the impacts of invasive predatory species on Great Lakes food
        webs (including on fish), we must understand how they modify the behavior,
        habitat use, and growth rate of their prey. We therefore are examining
        the disruptive effects of cercopagids through trait-mediated effects
        on their zooplankton prey with laboratory experiments and field surveys.
        Our recent research is indicating that indeed, the effect of <i>Bythotrephes</i>-induced
        changes in zooplankton behavior is as important, if not more important,
        than the lethal effects through predation. This has implications to Great
        Lakes fish recruitment, and this study will further build tools and approaches
        to examine the influence of trait-mediated interactions between other
        species (including future invasives) in the Great Lakes. This work is
        supported by a grant from the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission (<a href="http://www.glfc.org/">GLFC
        web site</a>).</p>

      <h3>2006 Accomplishments</h3>
      <p><em><strong>2006 Lake Michigan Field Sampling:</strong> </em></p>
      <p>Field sampling was conducted to obtain information regarding zooplankton,
        fish, and phytoplankton density and vertical distribution during day
        and night periods, as well as vertical profiles of abiotic factors. Sampling
        occurred during 8 day-night cruises in June, July, August, and September
        at the M45 site. </p>
      <p>Fish data was collected using two methods.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Method 1</strong> entailed determining fish vertical distribution
          and abundance acoustically using a split-beam ecosounder. This instrument
          also provided the body lengths of each target. Acoustic measurements
          was taken both during midday and midnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Method 2 </strong>entails collecting fish with 300-micron
          Tucker trawl during midnight. We lowered the trawl to depths where
          fish are observed acoustically and then fished the trawl for 6, 10-minute
          intervals at a speed of 2 nauts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trawling helped match the size distribution of netted fish with those
        acquired using acoustics, thereby identifying fish species. In addition,
        we plan to evaluate gut content of netted fish to determine characteristics
        of fish planktivory.</p>
      <p>Zooplankton data was also collected using two methods.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Method 1</strong> entailed pumping zooplankton from 10, continuous
          4-m tall sections of the water column, spanning 1 to 40 m below the
          surface. Starting at bottom section, water was pumped from a 40-m depth
          into a 64-micron plankton net for 2.5 minutes, and then the suction
          hose was lifted to a 39-m depth, and pumping was repeated, and then
          again for 38 and 37-m depths. In total, pumping for each 4-m section
          lasted for 10 minutes and comprise about 1000 L. At the end of each
          sampling interval, the net was rinsed off, captured zooplankton were
          preserved, and the next 4-m interval was started. We conducted this
          sampling during both midday and midnight to determine changes in the
          vertical distribution of zooplankton species.</li>
        <li><strong>Method 2</strong> entailed towing a 64-micron, 0.5 m diameter
          plankton net from 40-m depth to the surface. Two replicate tows were
          conducted during the midnight sampling period. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Physical data were collected during midday and midnight using a Seabird
        CTD profiler. This instrument obtained vertical profiles of temperature,
        light intensity, and chlorophyll. In addition, Secchi depth and ambient
        sunlight intensity were also measured during midday.</p>
      <p> <strong>2006 Laboratory Experiments</strong></p>
      <p> <em>Predation Experiments</em></p>
      <p><img src="../Images/2004/aispeacor04-1f2.jpg" alt="Daphnia" width="64" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Last
        summer, we conducted a series of <i>Bythotrephes </i> predation
        experiments that focused on the consumption of <i>Daphnia mendotae</i>.
        This summer we conducted experiments that focused on the consumption
        of other prey species that might also be important to <i>Bythotrephes</i>.
        Our first experiment used a prey assemblage that <i>Bythotrephes </i> encounter
        offshore in near-surface regions of the water column during the daytime.
        Our second experiment used a prey assemblage from the near-shore region.
        In both experiments, <i>Bythotrephes</i> significantly
        reduced copepod nauplii and <i>Bosmina longirostris</i>, but consumption
        of these prey items was at a lesser rate than those rates observed for <i>Bythotrephes</i> consuming <i>Daphnia</i>. Our results help provide a better understanding of <i>Bythotrephes</i> predation
        in different mixtures of prey types.</p>
      In Lake Michigan, <i>Daphnia mendotae</i> migrate downward when faced with <i>Bythotrephes</i> predation
      risk. This migration may affect competition between <i>D. mendotae </i> and other
      herbivorous zooplankton, which remain in near-surface regions during the
      day. Therefore, predators of <i>Daphnia may</i> have an indirect positive
      affect other herbivorous zooplankton. We conducted an experiment to evaluate
      the importance of <i>Bythotrephes</i>-mediated indirect interactions between <i>Daphnia
      and</i> near-surface zooplankton. Over a 6-day period, we incubated a natural assemblage
      of near-surface zooplankton in 1-L bottles that were filled with lake water.
      To the bottles, we also added different densities of <i>Daphnia mendotae</i>.
      At the end of the experiment, we evaluated <i> Daphnia </i>'s effect on its competitors'
      survival, development, egg production, and somatic growth. Data from this
      experiment are in the process of being analyzed. Growth bioassay experiments
      We conducted two growth bioassay experiments, one in July and one in August,
      to evaluate food resource conditions at different depth and to determine
      if a food resource gradient would influence tradeoffs associated with prey
      vertical migration. Because food resource conditions may change within
      a year and from year to year, it was necessary to conduct these experiments
      this year to compare results with similar experiments conducted last year.
      Results of this year's experiments showed that growth differences due to
      food resources effects are minor compared to water temperature effects,
      which was similar to the results of the previous experiments thus supporting
      the generality of our findings.
      <p><em> Competition experiment</em></p>
      <p><img src="/res/Task_rpts/Images/2004/aispeacor04-1f4.jpg" alt="Bythotrephes chasing Daphnia" width="400" height="97"></p>
      <p> <i>Bythotrephes</i> chasing <i>Daphnia</i></p>
      <p><em>Column experiments</em> </p>
      <p>In previous column experiments conducted by us and other researchers,
        the response of <i>Daphnia to</i> predator kairomones has been dependent
        on light conditions. In the past, we have modified light conditions by
        changing the intensity of overhead lighting; however, this methodology
        can limit experiment design. We conducted experiments this summer that
        tested a second approach to modify light conditions, one in which dye
        is used to intensify light attenuation. Data from this experiment are
        in the process of being analyzed.</p>
      <p><em>Resting egg study</em></p>
      <p>We began research to examine <i>Bythotrephes</i> nonlethal effects in
        an evolutionary context. We plan to do this by evaluating the response
        of <i>Daphnia hatched</i> from resting eggs that were deposited before
        and after <i>Bythotrephes</i> invasion. This summer we have collected
        sediment cores, isolated resting eggs for the sediment and hatched them
        out in the lab. We now plan to use column experiments to determine at
        what time in history do <i>Daphnia respond</i> to <i>Bythotrephes</i>'
        predation risk. Results of this research could shed light into changes
        in nonlethal effects on Great Lakes zooplankton over the last two decades
        and further our understanding of the nonlethal effects of invasive species
        in general.</p>
      <h3>Past Accomplishments</h3>
      <p><strong>1) Laboratory studies. </strong><br>
        Emphasis was placed on developing the "organ"
        experimental set up. This system incorporates a flow-through design using
        a peristaltic pump, in which resource and predator cue can be added at
        a constant rate, and which allows us to run experimental over several-day
        periods. This is important, because we can determine the long-term effects
        of induced changes on individual and population growth rate of zooplankton.
        Further, we improved our control of a temperature gradient across the
        experimental cylinders. </p>
      <p> <img src="/res/Task_rpts/Images/2004/aispeacor04-1f1.jpg" alt="mean vertical position of Daphnia to Bythotrephes (day/night)" width="432" height="226"><br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Day and night mean vertical position (+/-
        SE bars) of <i>Daphnia mendotae</i> to karimones of <i>Bythotrephes</i></p>
      <p> We conducted several laboratory experiments designed to examine anti-predator
        tactics in zooplankton induced by invasive predatory cladocerans (IPC).
        We focused specifically on non-lethal interactions between <i>Bythotrephes</i> longimanus
        and <i>Daphnia mendotae</i> because it is an important food resource
        to both <i>Bythotrephes</i> and native fishes, and it is a model organism
        to study predator-induced tactics. Results of the experiment indicate
        that <i>D. mendotae </i> in fact do respond to the presence of <i>Bythotrephes</i> by
        modifying their behavior. In particular, <i>D. mendotae </i> responded
        to <i>Bythotrephes</i> kairomone (extruded chemicals) by significantly
        lowering their vertical position into cooler thermal conditions (Figure
        1). This induced behavior resulted in a 40% reduction of individual growth
        rate.</p>
      <p> Another experiment strengthens the assertion that <i>Bythotrephes</i> cue
        levels are strong enough in the field to elicit responses from zooplankton.
        We found that water collected from a site with high <i>Bythotrephes</i> density
        elicited a very strong response, while water collected from a site with
        low <i>Bythotrephes</i> did not. (Fig. 2). </p>

      <p>These results suggest that <i>Bythotrephes</i> could have serious consequences
        to <i>Daphnia </i>population density and dynamics through induced (trait
        mediated) effects. In addition, <i>Bythotrephes</i> -induced responses
        like those observed in our experiment may reduce the availability of
        this resource to native Great Lakes fishes.</p>
      <p> Other results include:</p>
      1. <i>Diacyclops thomasi</i> responded to fish kairomone by lowering their
      vertical position in the day, not at night. <br>
      2. <i>Diacyclops thomasi</i> responded to <i>Bythotrephes</i> in a similar
      manner to that of fish, but did not respond to <i>Mysis</i>. <br>
      3. <i>Daphnia mendotae</i> responded to fish kairomone by lowering their
      vertical position in the day and night.<br>
      4. <i>Daphnia mendotae</i> respond differently to Mysis and <i>Bythotrephes</i>.<br>

      <p> <strong>2) Field survey work. </strong><br>
      </p>
      <p> Another component of our research involves field work in off shore Muskegon
        starting from June to October 2004, in coordination with other research
        projects (i.e., Vanderploeg and Picklova invasive predator cladoceran project).
        A number of vessel excursions were made to accomplished several goals.
        First, we tested the use of a diaphragm-pump sampler for determining vertical
        distribution of zooplankton, including IPC. This sampling technique was
        compared to the use of plankton nets and proved to be an adequate means
        of collecting zooplankton. This tool is important because it allows us
        to follow the vertical movements of both invertebrate predators and prey.
        The diaphragm-pump sampler was also found to be less destructive on zooplankton
        specimens than typical net sampling. This will allows better estimates
        of zooplankton life-history characteristics as well as overall productivity.
        Second, we collected live organisms for use in the laboratory experiments
        above. Currently, there is no protocol for culturing <i>Bythotrephes</i> in
        a laboratory environment, so this was key to our successful completion
        of the anti-predator tactics studies. Third, we completed surveys that
        followed the vertical distribution of zooplankton at near- and offshore
        sites (i.e., m15, m45, and m110). The surveys provided information about
        how the zooplankton density and vertical distribution change spatially,
        seasonally, inter-annually, and with respect to IPC densities. In addition
        to these day trips, we collaborated with other GLERL researchers on the
        diel sampling cruise conducted over two, 4-d periods in August. We used
        the diaphragm-pump sampler to provide important information of the day
        and night vertical distribution of zooplankton. </p>

      <p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Invertebrate predators may indirectly affect
        larval fish through density effects (predation, straight arrows) on zooplankton
        or inducing changes in zooplankton phenotype (trait changes, dashed arrow)
        such as changed vertical habitat migration or activity that affects growth
        rate and vulnerability.</p>
