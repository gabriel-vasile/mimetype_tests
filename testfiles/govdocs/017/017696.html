<P>When a genetic mutation occurs in a population, a new characteristic may be displayed.
If the mutation causes health problems, a person with the mutation is considered
to have a genetic disease. This activity is intended to give you an opportunity to
do research to determine the allele frequencies of a genetic disease. You will write
about the effects of a genetic disease, search out the number of people with the
disease (not an easy task), and use this information to determine the frequency of
alleles, as well as the number of genotypes/phenotypes in the population. You will
need at least a week to gather information.</P>
<P>You will recall in the Hardy-Weinberg principle that <IMG SRC="sRes1.GIF" WIDTH="62"
HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">, where <I>P </I>represents the frequency (probability)
of a dominant allele, and<I> q </I>represents the frequency of the recessive allele.
Also recall that when this binomial is expanded we obtain <IMG SRC="sRes2.GIF" WIDTH="92"
HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. <IMG SRC="sRes3.GIF" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> represents the frequency of a person who has inherited
two dominant alleles (pure dominant homozygote) and will display the dominant trait
(the trait will be visible to an observer). <IMG SRC="sRes4.GIF" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> represents the frequency of the person with the dominant
trait, who has inherited one dominant and one recessive allele (heterozygote), and
so is a carrier of the recessive trait. <IMG SRC="sRes5.GIF" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="18"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> represents the frequency of a person who has inherited
two recessive alleles (pure recessive homozygote) and will display the recessive
trait.</P>
<P>Shown below are examples of calculations needed to determine allele frequency.</P>
<P>* Given: Disease A is the recessive trait and affects <IMG SRC="sRes6.GIF" WIDTH="23"
HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> people.</P>
<P>Solution: Since the disease is recessive, it affects only people who have inherited
two recessive alleles. So <IMG SRC="sRes7.GIF" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0"> and <IMG SRC="sRes8.GIF" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">=0.1.
From <IMG SRC="sRes9.GIF" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> we can
determine that <IMG SRC="sRes10.GIF" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">.
Now that we know both <I>P</I> and<I> q</I>, we can determine the number of carriers.
The carriers are people who have a recessive allele in their genetic make-up yet
display the dominant trait. That is, they have one recessive and one dominant allele.</P>
<P>The frequency of the:</P>
<P>carrier is <IMG SRC="sRes11.GIF" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">,</P>
<P>pure dominant is <IMG SRC="sRes12.GIF" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">,
and</P>
<P>the recessive trait is <IMG SRC="sRes13.GIF" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0">.</P>
<P>*<I>Note: The sum of the three values above is one.</I></P>
<P>* Given: Disease B a dominant trait affecting <IMG SRC="sRes14.GIF" WIDTH="23"
HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> individuals.</P>
<P>Solution: A dominant disease affects those individuals who have inherited one
or two dominant alleles. In the expansion of <IMG SRC="sRes15.GIF" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="18"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">, the dominant frequency is <IMG SRC="sRes16.GIF" WIDTH="51"
HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">=<IMG SRC="sRes17.GIF" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. The frequency of individuals not affected is <IMG SRC="sRes18.GIF"
WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">so <IMG SRC="sRes19.GIF" WIDTH="222"
HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> and <IMG SRC="sRes20.GIF" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. We know that <IMG SRC="sRes21.GIF" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> and so conclude <IMG SRC="sRes22.GIF" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="12"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. There are no carriers of this disease. Those with one
dominant and one recessive allele aren't considered carriers because their genetic
make-up contains the dominant allele and so they will have the disease.</P>
<P>* Given: Disease C a recessive trait that is sex linked (X chromosome/recessive)
and affects <IMG SRC="sRes23.GIF" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">
male births.</P>
<P>Solution: A female has two X chromosomes, whereas a male has one X and one Y chromosome.
An allele that is linked to the X chromosome will be contained on only the X chromosome
(there will not be a corresponding allele on the Y chromosome). When a recessive
genetic disease is linked to the X chromosome a male can only receive one of these
recessive alleles. In order for a female to inherit this recessive trait she would
need two recessive alleles, but it is different for the male. He needs only to inherit
one recessive allele. That is because he has no equivalent gene on the Y chromosome
to dominate the recessive X chromosome allele. Therefore, every male that is affected
has the recessive X chromosome allele, and so we conclude that <IMG SRC="sRes24.GIF"
WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">, and <IMG SRC="sRes25.GIF" WIDTH="114"
HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">.</P>
<P>* Given: Disease D a recessive trait with the frequency of carriers being <IMGSRC="sRes26.GIF" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">.</P>
<P>Solution: We know that <IMG SRC="sRes27.GIF" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0"> and since <IMG SRC="sRes28.GIF" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0">, we can substitute for <I>P</I> and obtain <IMG SRC="sRes29.GIF" WIDTH="162"
HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="sRes30.GIF" WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="18"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. The quadratic formula calculates <IMG SRC="sRes31.GIF"
WIDTH="342" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> so <IMG SRC="sRes32.GIF" WIDTH="61"
HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> or <IMG SRC="sRes33.GIF" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. Since the trait is recessive we conclude that <IMG SRC="sRes34.GIF"
WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> and <IMG SRC="sRes35.GIF" WIDTH="63"
HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">. Let's take this problem farther and use the
frequency values to determine what the genetic make-up would be for a population
of 1,000,000 people. The number of people with a particular genetic make-up is found
by multiplying the frequency values times the total population. So the number of
people who are:</P>
<P>pure dominant is <IMG SRC="sRes36.GIF" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0"></P>
<P>carriers is <IMG SRC="sRes37.GIF" WIDTH="295" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>pure recessive is <IMG SRC="sRes38.GIF" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0"></P>
<P>*<I>The sum of the values above is not equal to the population because of rounding
error</I>.</P>
