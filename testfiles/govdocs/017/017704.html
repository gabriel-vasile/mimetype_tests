<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers are 
  increasingly using animal models to study the genetic basis of complex human 
  behaviors, such as alcoholism. The most commonly used animal species are rodents, 
  but other species, such as nonhuman primates, fruit flies, and zebrafish, can 
  also provide important information. A variety of approaches are employed in 
  these studies, particularly knockout and transgenic mice as well as specially 
  bred animal lines that can be used for various genetic analyses, including quantitative 
  trait locus mapping. Other strategies applied in genetic studies in animal models 
  include random mutagenesis, virus­mediated gene transfer, and gene expression 
  profiling.</font></strong> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Key 
  words: genetic theory of AODU (alcohol and other drug use); alcoholic beverage, 
  phenotype; animal model, gene knockout, transgenic technology; QTL (quantitative 
  trait locus) mapping; mutagenesis; gene expression; genetic trait; genetic correlation 
  analysis</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vertebrate and invertebrate 
  animal models contribute to researchers&#8217; knowledge about the genetics 
  of alcoholism. Overall, the DNA sequences of humans and other organisms (e.g., 
  other primates, rodents, and even fruit flies or yeast) are rather similar (e.g., 
  Bihoreau et al. 2001). Therefore, findings regarding the association of certain 
  genes with specific alcohol­related physiological changes and behaviors (i.e., 
  phenotypes) in animals can at least to some degree be extended to human alcoholics 
  and vice versa. In fact, some researchers have suggested that mouse lines carrying 
  human genes&#8212;an approach called gene­swap&#8212;will become a common method 
  for studying both the effects of specific genes and genetic differences among 
  humans (Nebert et al. 2000). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One example of how genetic 
  discovery in human alcoholics can be translated to animal research involves 
  the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor gene (called <em>DRD<sub>2</sub></em> in 
  humans and <em>Drd<sub>2</sub></em> in mice). Dopamine is a brain chemical (i.e., 
  neurotransmitter) used in the communication between nerve cells. To exert its 
  effects, dopamine is released from the signal­emitting cell and binds to docking 
  molecules (i.e., receptors) on the surface of the signal­receiving cell. Several 
  genes encode dopamine receptors, including <em>DRD<sub>2</sub></em>. More than 
  a decade ago, some studies implicated variations in the <em>DRD<sub>2</sub></em> 
  gene as a factor influencing a person&#8217;s risk of developing severe alcoholism, 
  although subsequent studies have provided mixed support for this claim (e.g., 
  Noble 2000; Matsushita et al. 2001). Subsequently, studies using a technique 
  called quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (described in more detail in the 
  section &#8220;Specific Genetic Approaches&#8221;) indicated that a region on 
  mouse chromosome 9, which is similar to a region on human chromosome 11 where 
  the <em>DRD<sub>2</sub></em> gene resides, influenced voluntary alcohol consumption 
  in mice (Phillips et al. 1994). Together with the clinical results obtained 
  in humans, this finding led researchers to consider the mouse <em>Drd<sub>2</sub></em> 
  gene as a good candidate for further study. Followup work in mice that lacked 
  functional D<sub>2</sub> receptors (knockout mice, which are also described 
  in the section &#8220;Specific Genetic Approaches&#8221;) provided further evidence 
  of the involvement of this receptor because the knockout mice exhibited markedly 
  reduced alcohol consumption compared with normal littermates (Phillips et al. 
  1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers also introduced 
  a modified virus into a specific brain region of rats called the nucleus accumbens, 
  which plays an important role in drug reward. The modified virus produced excessive 
  amounts of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor and resulted in reduced alcohol consumption 
  and preference in the animals (Thanos et al. 2001).<sup>1</sup> (<sup>1</sup> 
  One would expect that if mice which lack a functional D<sub>2</sub> receptor 
  exhibit reduced alcohol consumption, animals producing excessive amounts of 
  that receptor should exhibit increased alcohol consumption. The prediction is 
  not that straightforward, however. The knockout mice, which lack the receptor, 
  likely no longer experience the rewarding effects of alcohol that are modulated 
  by that receptor; accordingly, their alcohol self­administration drops. The 
  animals with the excessive receptor levels, in contrast, receive a stronger 
  rewarding effect after consuming alcohol. As a result, they will consume less 
  alcohol to get the same rewarding effect as rats with normal receptor levels.) 
  Although these findings do not prove that the gene identified by QTL mapping 
  on mouse chromosome 9 is <em>Drd<sub>2</sub></em>, they do provide justification 
  for continued studies of the role of this gene and its product in alcohol consumption. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article describes several 
  of the genetic methods that have been used in various animal models of alcohol 
  research, including rodents and other species. It is important to realize, however, 
  that for such complex diseases as alcoholism, animal models cannot <em>prove</em> 
  genetic associations in humans. Human alcoholism cannot be exactly replicated 
  in animals, even though some external factors thought to influence human alcohol 
  consumption, such as physiological and social stress, can be modeled in animals. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite these limitations, 
  the ability to precisely control environmental and genetic characteristics of 
  animal models allows researchers to identify important avenues of investigation 
  that can then be translated to research in humans. For example, because the 
  gene frequencies can be changed in animals by selective mating or by specific 
  mutations introduced through genetic engineering, one can systematically study 
  changes in the influence of a single gene that are caused by this gene&#8217;s 
  interactions with other genes (i.e., the genetic background). Ultimately, careful 
  investigation of gene&#8211;gene interactions in human populations will contribute 
  to a more complete understanding of the coordinated biological systems that 
  influence the susceptibility to and progression of alcoholism as well as the 
  effectiveness of alcoholism treatment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>SPECIFIC GENETIC 
  APPROACHES</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Knockout Mice and Transgenic 
  Mice</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a known gene is suspected 
  to influence a trait (e.g., sensitivity to alcohol), researchers can disrupt 
  or enhance the function of that gene using molecular genetic techniques (Homanics 
  2002) and then study the effects of this genetic alteration. For example, mice 
  in which the function of a particular gene has been disrupted&#8212;called knockout 
  mice&#8212;are increasingly being used in research (Anagnostopoulos et al. 2001), 
  including numerous studies in alcohol research. The disruption of gene function 
  also has been applied to more &#8220;primitive&#8221; organisms, such as yeast, 
  to study alcohol as a stressor (i.e., a stimulus that activates certain &#8220;stress­related&#8221; 
  signaling pathways in the organism) (Zu et al. 2001). Furthermore, disruption 
  of gene function is a classic approach in genetic analyses of the fruit fly 
  <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (discussed in the section &#8220;Research in 
  Other Species&#8221;). Similarly, researchers are examining the functions of 
  a particular gene by introducing that gene into other organisms, generating 
  &#8220;transgenic&#8221; animals (most commonly mice).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knockout and transgenic 
  mice have been used in various areas of alcohol research, such as studies of 
  the genetic basis of alcohol&#8217;s pleasurable (i.e., rewarding) effects (for 
  a review, see Cunningham and Phillips 2003). In many cases, a particular transgenic 
  or knockout animal is studied because pharmacological or electrophysiological 
  evidence implicated the gene product that is altered in that animal. Evidence 
  from human linkage studies&#8212;studies in which researchers analyze whether 
  people with a certain trait (e.g., alcoholism) are more likely to carry a particular 
  variant of a gene or DNA region&#8212;probably has also influenced research 
  in these animal models (e.g., Phillips et al. 1998; Deltour et al. 1999). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain difficulties, however, 
  are associated with interpretation of data generated using transgenic or knockout 
  animals (e.g., Gingrich and Hen 2000). In particular, any interpretation must 
  take into consideration the difference between variation in gene function associated 
  with different variants (i.e., alleles) of a gene versus the obliteration of 
  function as a consequence of gene knockout technology. In some instances, a 
  disease develops when the function of a specific gene is completely absent. 
  In other cases, variation in disease susceptibility appears to be associated 
  with altered, rather than absent, gene function. In these instances, when elimination 
  of gene function affects a trait (e.g., alcohol consumption), one cannot conclude 
  that this gene is associated with the trait variation (i.e., differences in 
  alcohol consumption levels) seen in &#8220;natural&#8221; populations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Quantitative Trait Locus 
  (QTL) Mapping</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quantitative traits are 
  genetically influenced characteristics that differ in the extent to which each 
  individual in a population possesses that characteristic (e.g., height or sensitivity 
  to alcohol), rather than in the kind of trait they possess (e.g., eye color). 
  Quantitative traits are generally determined by more than one gene, each of 
  which can exist in several forms (i.e., alleles), as well as by multiple environmental 
  factors. Thus, differences in the trait among the individuals in a population 
  most commonly result from variations in gene function rather than from the presence 
  versus absence of gene function. The DNA regions that influence quantitative 
  traits (i.e., that contain genes determining the trait) are called QTLs. QTL 
  mapping takes advantage of naturally occurring genetic variation to determine 
  the regions of specific chromosomes that harbor genes influencing quantitative 
  traits. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For QTL mapping analyses, 
  researchers can use different types of genetically defined animal populations, 
  including the following (Palmer and Phillips 2002):</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Recombinant inbred 
      (RI) strains.</em> These strains are generated by repeatedly inbreeding 
      brother&#8211;sister pairs from the second­generation (F2) offspring of 
      two genetically distinct parent inbred strains. Because of genetic recombination 
      of the DNA from the parent strains that occurs during the production of 
      sperm and egg cells, each F2 animal has a slightly different combination 
      of genes from the parent strains. By repeated inbreeding, animal strains 
      are generated in which all the animals within a strain are genetically identical, 
      but each strain differs in the specific combination of parental genes. (For 
      more information on this approach, also see the article by Dick and Foroud, 
      pp. 172&#8211;180.).</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Chromosome substitution 
      strains (CSS).</em> To create a CSS, an entire chromosome of one inbred 
      strain is replaced with that of another strain. The final product is a mouse 
      of one strain that has been altered only with regard to replacement of a 
      single pair of chromosomes from another &#8220;donor&#8221; strain. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Intercross and 
      backcross populations.</em> An intercross population is the F2 offspring 
      of two genetically distinct inbred strains. A backcross population is produced 
      by mating two genetically distinct inbred strains to produce the first generation 
      (F1) and then breeding the F1 offspring back to one of the parent inbred 
      strains.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em> Selected lines.</em> 
      These lines are discussed in the next section. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Heterogeneous populations.</em> 
      Individuals within these populations have diverse genetic backgrounds. The 
      most commonly used heterogeneous mouse stock was produced by interbreeding 
      eight genetically diverse inbred strains.<br>
      Finer mapping of a QTL to the smallest possible genetic segment may involve 
      the use of specialized genetic models (e.g., models called interval­specific 
      congenic strains [ISCS] and advanced intercross lines [AIL]) as well as 
      of heterogeneous populations (see Palmer and Phillips 2002). </font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol­related traits have 
  been most extensively mapped in mice (see Crabbe et al. 1999). To identify specific 
  genetic variants associated with a particular alcohol effect, it is important 
  to narrow the DNA region possessing a QTL down to one that is likely to contain 
  only a few genes (see Palmer and Phillips 2002). One trait for which researchers 
  have made considerable progress is relative sensitivity to alcohol&#8217;s sedative 
  effects (Ehringer et al. 2001). Any genes that are identified in such a mouse 
  model of alcohol sensitivity may prove important for investigations in human 
  populations, because relative insensitivity to alcohol may be related to increased 
  alcoholism risk (e.g., Heath et al. 2001). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Selected Lines</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Selected lines are generated 
  by selectively breeding animals within a population that have either very high 
  or very low levels of the desired trait (e.g., alcohol consumption). When the 
  selective breeding is conducted over several generations, the selected lines 
  often show progressively greater differences from each other with respect to 
  the trait under investigation and with respect to the gene variants that influence 
  the trait. The lines should remain similar, however, with respect to traits 
  not influenced by those genes. Selective breeding approaches have resulted in 
  several rat and mouse lines that have extremely high or low sensitivity, preference, 
  or aversion to alcohol. Some of these lines have also been shown to exhibit 
  different types of adaptation in brain function (i.e., neuroadaptation) in response 
  to alcohol exposure. Selected lines are frequently used to identify traits that 
  are influenced by common underlying genetic factors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Selected lines also are 
  being used in QTL mapping studies to locate the genes that influence the selected 
  trait. For example, a study comparing rats that were selectively bred to consume 
  either large amounts of alcohol (i.e., alcohol­preferring, or P, rats) or small 
  amounts of alcohol (i.e., alcohol­nonpreferring, or NP, rats) identified a QTL 
  near the neuropeptide Y (<em>NPY</em>) gene (Carr et al. 1998). NPY is a small 
  protein molecule (i.e., a peptide) that has been suggested to have diverse functions, 
  including the control of food intake, emotional behavior, and responses to alcohol. 
  Studies in other genetic models (e.g., knockout mice) and neurochemical studies 
  in selected lines have supported a role for NPY in alcohol consumption (Tecott 
  and Heberlein 1998). The results regarding the function of NPY are equivocal, 
  however, because no QTL in that gene region was found in a different set of 
  high­alcohol­drinking (HAD) and low­alcohol­drinking (LAD) rat lines (Foroud 
  et al. 2000). These contradictory findings may result from differences in the 
  genetic backgrounds of the rats used in the two studies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly discrepant results 
  regarding the role of NPY have been found in humans. Thus, one study in humans 
  found that a certain <em>NPY</em> gene variant was associated with increased 
  alcohol consumption (Kauhanen et al. 2000), whereas in a subsequent investigation 
  this gene variant was found less frequently among alcoholics (Ilveskoski et 
  al. 2001). This discrepancy may result from differences in the phenotypes that 
  were examined in the two studies. Future research needs to clarify the exact 
  role of the <em>NPY</em> gene in influencing alcohol consumption and alcoholism 
  risk as well as the exact sources of the discrepancies in the existing findings. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Random Mutagenesis</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers use transgenic 
  or knockout mice to study the specific effects of a known gene. To identify 
  new genes that might affect a trait of interest, however, they may use an approach 
  called random mutagenesis. With this approach, the animals (e.g., mice) are 
  treated with a chemical that can induce changes (i.e., mutations) in the DNA 
  of the sperm or egg cells so that the mutations are passed on to the offspring 
  of those animals. Consequently, every gene becomes a potential target for study. 
  In 1999, seven institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including 
  the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), initiated a 
  mouse genetics research program to launch genomewide mutagenesis projects in 
  mice and develop methods allowing rapid screening of large numbers of phenotypes 
  resulting from such random mutagenesis (Moldin et al. 2001). The hope is that 
  these genetic tools will lead to broad insights in the study of complex behaviors, 
  such as alcohol consumption. However, researchers will be facing significant 
  hurdles in achieving this goal. For example, phenotypic screening of animals 
  with such mutations is most likely to detect major gene effects and may miss 
  more subtle effects. Furthermore, the identification of specific mutation(s) 
  associated with a complex trait will require extensive mapping like that used 
  in QTL analyses (Belknap et al. 2001). The fruits of this approach in addiction 
  research await harvesting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Virus­Mediated Gene 
  Transfer</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A compelling approach to 
  confirming the involvement of a specific gene in a trait thought to be controlled 
  by a specific region of the central nervous system is to transfer that gene 
  into that specific region and then look for changes in the trait. One way to 
  transfer the gene is to insert it into a modified virus that can then be used 
  to infect a specific cell type but is not harmful to the animal or human being 
  studied. Once the virus infects its target cells, it begins to produce the product 
  of the inserted gene, resulting in abnormal or higher­than­normal levels (i.e., 
  overexpression) of that gene product in the infected cells. The technology associated 
  with this virus­mediated gene transfer is improving (Carlezon et al. 2000), 
  and the method is being used in alcohol research. For example, as mentioned 
  previously, researchers have demonstrated an association of <em>Drd<sub>2</sub></em> 
  overexpression with reduced alcohol consumption using virus­mediated gene transfer 
  (Thanos et al. 2001). Other investigators are studying the role of certain enzymes 
  in alcohol­induced liver injury using virus­mediated gene transfer of those 
  enzymes (Wheeler et al. 2001). This approach may have far­reaching implications 
  for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism and other addictions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Gene Expression Profiling</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers are also conducting 
  large­scale studies of changes in gene expression (i.e., in the amount of gene 
  product produced) that may be associated with alcoholism and other addictions 
  (Uhl et al. 2001). Using technologies called gene chip or microarray analyses, 
  these investigators examine the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously 
  from a single DNA sample. This approach is also called gene expression profiling. 
  It allows researchers to collect information about genetic changes that occur 
  together in a coordinated fashion to affect a given phenotype, rather than being 
  limited to the examination of one gene at a time. For example, alcoholics often 
  exhibit loss of white matter in various brain regions. This white matter is 
  composed of the extensions of nerve cells that are normally covered by an insulating 
  substance called myelin. Using gene expression profiling, researchers were able 
  to demonstrate reduced expression of several myelin­related genes in the brain 
  tissue of alcoholics obtained after they died (Lewohl et al. 2001). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Animal studies already have 
  identified many genes whose expression is altered after alcohol and other drug 
  administration; moreover, such analyses demonstrated that different genetic 
  changes are associated with alcohol&#8217;s effects after initial and long­term 
  (i.e., chronic) consumption. One example of animals that have been profiled 
  for differences in gene expression are mice that were selectively bred for extreme 
  differences in sensitivity to alcohol&#8217;s sedative (i.e., hypnotic) effects 
  (Xu et al. 2001). In other work, a gene called cocaine­ and amphetamine­regulated 
  transcript (<em>CART</em>) was found to change its expression in response to 
  cocaine and amphetamines. This gene was further studied by injecting a fragment 
  of the <em>CART</em> gene product into the ventral tegmental area of rats, a 
  brain region thought to influence the experience of drug reward. Injection of 
  this fragment induced behaviors virtually identical to those seen after cocaine 
  administration (Kimmel et al. 2000). Similar work is being conducted to study 
  other genes whose expression is found to be changed in response to alcohol.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>RESEARCH IN OTHER 
  SPECIES</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers also are studying 
  the genetics of alcoholism and other addictions in species other than rodents 
  and humans. For example, changes in gene expression in response to chronic cocaine 
  treatment have been described in certain brain areas of nonhuman primates (Freeman 
  et al. 2001), and similar analyses are likely to be performed in nonhuman primate 
  models of alcoholism. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another commonly used animal 
  model is the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, which has a long and 
  rich history in genetic research. The entire <em>Drosophila</em> DNA sequence 
  has been deciphered and has shown considerable similarity (i.e., homology) with 
  that of mammals (Adams et al. 2000). Several laboratories have studied <em>Drosophila</em> 
  genes that influence sensitivity or tolerance to alcohol (see Heberlein 2000). 
  One <em>Drosophila</em> mutant with markedly increased alcohol sensitivity has 
  been named &#8220;cheapdate&#8221; (see Heberlein 2000). The mutation in this 
  strain affects a signaling system called the cAMP pathway, which is important 
  for many regulatory processes in the cell. The cAMP signaling pathway also has 
  been implicated in determining alcohol consumption and sensitivity to alcohol 
  in studies of a mouse knockout model (Thiele et al. 2000) and of human alcoholics 
  (Yamamoto et al. 2001). These observations suggest that <em>Drosophila</em> 
  will provide an important model system for at least some aspects of alcohol&#8217;s 
  effects. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies in various animal 
  models sometimes also complement or inform each other. For example, the findings 
  regarding the role of the cAMP signaling pathway just described are supported 
  by studies in the round worm (i.e., nematode) <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>. 
  Analyses in that organism identified a gene that is also part of the cAMP pathway 
  and which influences adaptation to another addictive substance, nicotine (Waggoner 
  et al. 2000). Similarly, non­alcohol­related research in <em>Drosophila</em> 
  has led to the isolation of a mouse gene that corresponds to a <em>Drosophila</em> 
  gene called neuralized, which subsequently was found to alter sensitivity to 
  alcohol (Ruan et al. 2001). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another organism that is 
  increasingly used in research on alcoholism and other addictions is the zebrafish 
  <em>Danio rerio</em>. The embryos of these fish are transparent, allowing easy 
  anatomical characterization that facilitates genetic analysis. Furthermore, 
  for many zebrafish genes, corresponding genes exist in mammals. For example, 
  researchers have cloned a zebrafish gene that corresponds to a mammalian receptor 
  for opioid drugs (e.g., morphine) and have studied that receptor&#8217;s distribution 
  in the zebrafish&#8217;s central nervous system (Porteros et al. 1999). This 
  research may have implications for alcohol research in humans because drugs 
  that interfere with the activity of opiates and their receptors (i.e., opiate 
  antagonists) have shown promise in alcoholism treatment (Kranzler and Van Kirk 
  2001). Researchers also have recently cloned the zebrafish gene for alcohol 
  dehydrogenase (ADH), the primary enzyme responsible for the degradation of alcohol 
  in the body (Dasmahapatra et al. 2001). This gene also exhibits substantial 
  genetic similarity to a human <em>ADH</em> gene. Finally, zebrafish exhibit 
  behavioral responses to alcohol that are reminiscent of those seen in other 
  model organisms (Gerlai et al. 2000). Consequently, research using zebrafish 
  may be a promising approach for identifying important genetic influences on 
  alcoholism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The search for genes related 
  to alcoholism using such methods as QTL mapping and random mutagenesis is a 
  painstaking process because of the difficulty of sifting through large amounts 
  of genetic information to identify relevant genes. Additional genetic approaches 
  (e.g., comparative sequence analyses) are being used to identify differences 
  in the genetic material within genetic regions implicated by QTL analyses that 
  could be functionally relevant to the trait associated with a given QTL. However, 
  finer mapping techniques are still needed to narrow down long lists of alleles 
  potentially related to the trait under investigation. Investigators are also 
  trying to integrate gene profiling information from animals with results from 
  human linkage studies in order to identify high­probability candidate genes 
  for further analyses. However, such &#8220;one­gene­at­a­time&#8221; approaches 
  are beginning to give way to synthetic approaches that consider interacting 
  genes and coordinated pathways that influence complex traits. The wealth of 
  sequencing information now available in various species, the development of 
  high­throughput methods for genetic analyses, and the evolution of methods for 
  handling massive data sets should all accelerate the identification of genes 
  that influence alcohol&#8217;s effects and the risk of alcoholism.</font></p>
