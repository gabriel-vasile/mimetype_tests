<p>
The Journal of Quantitative Trait Loci (JQTL), sponsored by the Crop Science Society of
America (CSSA), will provide a peer-reviewed, fully electronic forum in which articles
dealing with the theory and practice of QTL analysis will be published.  <p>
<p>
The publication format will facilitate links to related publications and databases and will
permit the inclusion of more complete analyses than are generally feasible in bound media. 
Improved publication speed, easy and inexpensive access, and flexibility should make JQTL a
preferred journal for the publication of papers dealing with the analysis of inheritance of
quantitative traits.<p>
<p>
Purposes of the Journal<p>
<p>
1. JQTL will publish articles relevant to the analysis, manipulation, and use of genes
modifying quantitative characters in any species. We are defining quantitative characters as
those for which the phenotypic variation among genotypes is continuous and cannot be
separated into discrete classes. This definition of QTL makes no assumptions regarding thenumber of genes controlling such characters, nor the magnitude of genetic effects.  When
appropriate, authors will be encouraged to include data sets on which their analyses depend.<p>
<p>
2. JQTL will serve as a medium for announcing, describing, and storing new software
developed for QTL analysis.<p>
<p>
3. JQTL will publish secondary analyses of primary data sets when such analyses prove novel
and illuminating.<p>
<p>
4. JQTL will publish worthy editorial commentaries and review articles as space and interest
warrant.<p>
<p>
General Standards<p>
<p>
Papers will be submitted via either electronic transmission or on diskette. They will consist of
ASCII text, with .gif files holding images.  Papers will be written in general accordance with
style standards of Crop Science (Publications Handbook and Style Manual, 1988, American
Society of Agronomy (ASA), Madison, WI).  Papers will be submitted to the editor, who will
then request review by two technical editors.<p>
<p>
Information To Be Inculded in Articles Submitted<p>
<p>
All articles should contain (a) title; (b) affiliation, phone number, and e-mail addresses of allauthors; (c) abstract briefly summarizing  the work; (d) introduction, methods, results and
discussion sections in accordance with ASA guidelines; and (e) literature cited. <p>
<p>
For all articles containing data sets, authors must supply a data dictionary (description of data
fields) and a description of how the data were gathered. <p>
<p>
Software submission:  All software described in a JQTL article should be, if at all possible,
available for JQTL readers.  Ideally, an anonymous ftp site would already exist from which
software could be downloaded.  If this is not the case, and the software was developed by the
authors, then the software should be uploaded to hordeum.oscs.montana.edu.  All executable
software should be accompanied by source code, if available, as well as a user manual. <p>
<p>
Acceptable formats are: <p>
Unix: a compressed tar file (compressed with either the compress program or by gzip)<p>
DOS/Windows: a PKZIP (.zip) file<p>
Macintosh: a StuffIt archive (.sit) file<p>
<p>
Originality and Novelty<p>
<p>
To be considered for publication, neither data nor analyses should have been published
previously in any peer-reviewed journal, book, or bulletin.  While updates (that is, second
year data sets or data sets gathered in new environments using lines already characterized)
may be considered for publication, they will generally be accepted as appendices to previousarticles.  New analyses of previously published data sets will be accepted if they provide
novel insights into the data.<p>
<p>
Peer Review and Comments<p>
<p>
Each submitted article will be reviewed by two scientists familiar with the area of research. 
They will be asked to review the manuscript for compliance with the above criteria, to judge
suitability of the article for inclusion in JQTL, and to write brief critiques of the manuscript
to be returned to the author.  The editors will attempt to evaluate the performance of
submitted software.<p>
<p>
Submission Protocol<p>
<p>
Articles may consist of text, tables, and data sets (all in ASCII format) and figures (in .GIF
format).  Other acceptable formats may be announced in the future.  There are no size
limitations.<p>
<p>
Before submission, authors should e-mail the editor (current address:
blake@hordeum.oscs.montana.edu) to request a submission number.  Files should then be
renamed to include the submission number (for example, text##.asc, fig1##.gif, fig2##.gif,
tabl##.asc, data##.asc). This should prevent one submission overwriting another.<p>
<p>
Submit files via ftp to hordeum.oscs.montana.edu<p>
<p>
Log in as jqtlsubm <p>
Password: your e-mail address.<p>
<p>
The editor will scan each submitted article for gross compliance with standards and then will
send all appropriate articles to two technical editors.  They will review the paper, suggest
modifications if necessary, and return the files to the editor, who will in turn send them to the
author as files appended to a letter describing the technical editors' recommendations.  For
manuscripts dealing with re-analysis of previously published data, the editor will invite the
author of the original publication to submit a review. This will provide the original authors an
avenue for direct feedback before publication of the new analyses.<p>
<p>
After receiving the technical editors' recommendations, the author may revise (if necessary)
and resubmit the paper with &quot;r&quot; appended to each file name (for example, text##r.asc,
fig1##r.gif, tabl##r.asc).  Each accepted manuscript will then be sent to CSSA headquarters
for HTML formatting and finally to the USDA, ARS, National Agricultural Library for
immediate publication.  JQTL will be continuously updated with new articles.<p>
<p>
Journal Access<p>
<p>
On April 1, 1995, JQTL became available for public online access from the National
Agricultural Library via World Wide Web at http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/  under the
heading Newsletters, Journals, and Other Publications.  <p>
<p>
No charge will be levied for publication or for journal access during 1995, although nominal
fees may be assessed at a later date.  JQTL will be indexed in the AGRICOLA bibliographic
database and by other biological indexing services.<p>
<p>
Journal Annual<p>
<p>
By the end of the first year of publication, we hope to have the capacity to make annual CD's
of the journal available for a nominal fee.<p>
