NCBI seminar:
Protein Domain Promiscuity and Evolution of Eukaryotes
Malay K Basu
Building 38A, B2 Library, October 25, 2005, 11 AM

In this talk I will try to put forward evidence that protein domain 
promiscuity, a term used in this study to indicate protein domain 
co-occurrence diversity of a particular domain, is an interesting trait 
for comparative-genomic analysis. Domain promiscuity appears to be an 
important indicator of genome complexity. I will discuss methods we used 
to numerically measure promiscuity and will show the evolution of 
promiscuity in Eukaryota. I will also show ancestral reconstruction 
using promiscuity as a trait, and will demonstrate how we can use this 
technique to get an idea about the time during evolution when a domain 
became promiscuous.
