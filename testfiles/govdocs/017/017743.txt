The data entered in this database was recorded by several individuals based on individual interpretations of  literature sources.  	
"Although attempts were made to maintain data quality, review of all 14,000+ records was not possible.  Users are therefore advised"	
that some errors may exist in the database as a result of recorder misinterpretations or data-entry errors.  Please notify third author (D.M. Carlisle:
