Hi Roberto:
Thanks. Do you have at hand a reference to breaking
into fragments for MD purposes a molecule that has no
repeating units? I am always brought to biopolymers or
at most modified proteins.

The molecules I want to study display properties that
depend from the whole, with subtle chirality axes. It
may well be that I did not grasp the substance of MD,
though I find difficult where to break the molecule.
Unless it is a formal breaking in some way, while
there is behind a trait-de-union as if the molecule
were intact.

Apologize for such naive expressions.
Thanks
francesco
