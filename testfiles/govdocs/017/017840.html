<blockquote><font color="#000080">[26 July 1971, first day of mission.]</font><p>

<font color="#000080">[The morning launch of Apollo 15 from Pad A at Launch Complex 39 avoids the high heat of a Florida summer but the weather is clear and bright, with few scattered clouds, which will allow the crowds watching the spectacle to track the flight for much of its ascent to orbit. Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center was built with 2 fully operational launch pads; in the expectation of a much higher launch rate than was ever achieved. Only <i>Apollo 10</i> departed from Pad B at a particularly busy time in the Apollo program, leading up to the launch of <i>Apollo 11</i>. Every other Apollo/Saturn V launch, including Apollo 15, began from Pad A.]</font><p>

<font color="#000080">[The spacecraft/vehicle stack is designated AS-510, signifying that it is the tenth launch of the Apollo/Saturn V combination. As the Apollo spacecraft components came off the production line, they were also assigned serial numbers to help distinguish them. Each had modifications which built on the experience gained from previous missions or which came from requirements of their particular mission. Therefore, each had checklists pertaining to their individual configurations.]</font><p>

<font color="#000080">[This mission was originally intended to be similar in scope to <i>Apollo 14,</i> both classed as 'H' missions, the extent of lunar exploration being limited by the walking range of the landing crew. However, the H mission for Apollo 15 was cancelled on 2 September 1970 as part of NASA's budgetary cutbacks and the advanced 'J' missions were brought forward to take advantage of the enhanced exploration promised by the Lunar Roving Vehicle, a 2-man buggy which would allow astronauts to explore up to 10 kilometres from the Lunar Module. Because of this, Apollo 15 is jumping the numerical sequence of modules, missing out CSM (Command/Service Module) 111 and LM (Lunar Module)-9. LM-9's destiny is to be located in the Apollo/Saturn V Center at KSC, where it now forms part of an impressive visitor attraction dedicated to the Apollo Program.]</font><p>

<font color="#000080">[CSM 112, among its upgrades, includes an array of scientific instruments and cameras called the SIM (Scientific Instrument Module), installed in a previously largely vacant sector of the Service Module. The Command Module includes controls for operating the SIM bay. The Lunar Module for this mission, LM-10, also has extensive modifications to permit an extended stay on the Moon, including improved propulsion and guidance, as well as the Lunar Roving Vehicle, cleverly folded on its side. The launch vehicle, AS-510, also has modifications to allow it to lift this heavier Apollo spacecraft to Earth orbit and then on to the Moon.]<p>

[The timing of an Apollo launch to the Moon falls within certain 'windows' or periods of time which are influenced by daily and monthly factors. The daily restriction to the window is due to the rotation of the Earth bringing the launch site to the correct relationship with the Moon's position in its orbit, to allow enough of a parking orbit around the Earth before the boost to the Moon. The monthly factors are the lighting requirements at the landing site. The landing should take place in the early lunar morning so that the Sun will be behind the astronauts as they approach from their east-to-west orbit. A low Sun-angle will also produce shadows on the lunar terrain that allow the Commander to recognise landmarks as well as aiding speed and distance perception. With a lunar day lasting 29.5 Earth days, the correct conditions for the landing only occur monthly.]<p>

[The first launch window for Apollo 15 begins at 09:34, Eastern Standard Time, on 26th July, 1971, and lasts 2 hours, 37 minutes. If technical problems or poor weather delay the launch, they can try again on the 27th, otherwise, they must wait for two opportunities in late August, or three more in late September.]<p>

[Before the voyage commences, there are two sections to the CSM Launch Checklist to be followed. The lift-off configuration is set and verified by the back-up CMP (Command Module Pilot), in this case Vance Brand, who checks that each switch, knob, adjustment and talkback indicator is correctly set for the arrival of the prime crew. The CSM launch Checklist systematically covers each of the 57 panels in the Apollo 15 CSM.  There are 454 lines in the checklist.  Some panels are covered by a single line, while panel 2 on the main display console requires 78 lines.]</font></blockquote>

<i>Command Module Main Display Console from Apollo Operations Handbook Block II Spacecraft (October 15, 1969). This console comprises panels 1, 2 and 3, and is very similar, though not identical, to the console in the Apollo 15 Command Module. This and other diagrams of the Apollo spacecraft are available from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/diagrams/apollo.html">Diagram page of the NASA History Website</a></i>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[At first glance, the Main Display Console of the Command Module is utterly overwhelming. But for those to whom an aircraft cockpit is unfamiliar territory, the &quot;front office&quot; of a Boeing 747 is also a visual racket. Not unlike the tales of people who regain their hearing after a lifetime of deafness, and perceive sounds as a jumble and without structure, finding order in the Apollo spacecraft is a concentrated learning process. When viewed with the skilled eye of the Apollo 15 crew, the cockpit quickly turns into, perhaps not a thing of beauty, but an entity born of structure and function.]<p>

[In February 2004, Dave Scott joined us for a review of the Journal.]<p>

[Scott - &quot;People don't have any idea how much stuff was in there.&quot;]<p>

[Three hours before launch, the prime crew enters the spacecraft and once settled, they continue the prelaunch checks. CDR (Commander), Dave Scott, takes the left couch facing the major flight controls and the abort handle. CMP, Alfred Worden occupies the centre couch, facing the caution and warning panel and ready to monitor the computer's display during the critical minutes of ascent. The electrical and environment systems are monitored during launch by the LMP (Lunar Module Pilot), Jim Irwin, who takes the right couch. The checklist for boost preparation will be performed starting at T - 20 minutes.]</font></blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control. T minus 46 minutes and counting. T minus 46 minutes and counting. We are proceeding satisfactorily, aiming toward our planned lift-off here for Apollo 15. The Apollo 15 astronaut crew standing by in the spacecraft at this time. They'll have quite a bit more work before we reach our T-zero, but they are standing by at this point. They've completed their guidance and alignment checks and are waiting as certain key launch vehicle checks are taking place at this time. We have just completed a check of the digital range safety command destruct system. These are the destruct packages aboard the three stages of the Saturn V that would be activated if the vehicle was flying off course and was a danger to personnel below. Of course before the destruct system would be activated, the abort sequence would take place and the astronaut crew and their spacecraft would be separated from the launch vehicle. Our weather is Go and all aspects of the countdown [are] Go. 44 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;
</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[<a name="rangesafety"></a>Each stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle has shaped explosive charges attached to its outer surface which, in the event of an abort, rupture the fuel and oxidiser tanks, dispersing their contents into the atmosphere rather than allow them to impact the Earth with dangerous loads still on board. The charge for the S-IC (the designation of the first stage) cuts a longitudinal breach in the fuel tank on the opposite side of the vehicle from that for the oxidiser tank so as to minimise their mixing during dispersion. Charges for the S-II (second stage) cut a 9 metre longitudinal opening in the hydrogen fuel tank and a series of lateral 4 metre ruptures in the squat LOX (liquid oxygen) tank. Those for the S-IVB (third stage) make two parallel 6 metre openings in the fuel tank and a 1.2 metre diameter hole in the LOX tank. These charges are fired only after the Command Module has separated from the launch vehicle. During a normal ascent, the destruct system is safed soon after the Launch Escape Tower is jettisoned; after about 3&frac12; minutes of flight.]<p>

[Early in the Apollo program, the Air Force had insisted that the LM, a vehicle from which every ounce of unneeded weight had been trimmed and which would be a home to men on the lunar surface, also had to have destruct ordnance attached. This was based on the premise that, in the event of a launch abort, it was better for propellants to be consumed before reaching the ground. After all, the LM would be unmanned at this stage. NASA pointed out the weight and safety penalties of this arrangement and eventually won what was a substantial argument by pointing out that the LM was hardly likely to survive the destruction of the S-IVB stage anyway. A similar conflict occurred over demands by the Air Force that the Service Module also carry destruct charges.]</font></blockquote>

<font color="#008000">

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control at T minus 40 minutes, 54 seconds and counting. Still proceeding very well at this time, aiming toward our planned T-zero at 9:34 a.m. [Eastern Daylight Time, 4 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time]. The astronauts will be busy again shortly in the spacecraft, particularly Command Module Pilot Al Worden, as he proceeds to go through the sequence of pressurizing the Reaction Control System [RCS] of the spacecraft. This is primarily concerned with those four quadrants of hundred pound [445 N] thrust rockets on the side of the Service Module. We pressurized that system before launch and Al Worden reads out the status of the overall system so that spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin and crew, back in the spacecraft control center, can determine that that system is Go for launch. Of course, the Reaction Control System [is] used extensively on the flight to and from the Moon for small refinements on trajectory. Here, in Firing Room 1, we're Go for the final portion of the count. We have a clearance from the range to launch and our countdown is continuing. The countdown has been going excellently since it picked up at 11:34 p.m. last evening following a 9 hour, 34 minute built-in hold. Since that time, a major portion of the count was devoted to the propellant loading of the Saturn V launch vehicle, bringing aboard liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen or so called cryogenic propellants aboard the three stages of the vehicle. We loaded more than three quarters of a million gallons [2.8 million litres] of the oxygen and hydrogen onboard and at lift-off we expect to have the vehicle weighing close to 6.5 million pounds [nearly 3,000 tonnes] on the launch pad. The Saturn V space vehicle stands some 363 feet [110.6 metres].&quot;
</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Journal contributor Henry Spencer - &quot;The actual countdown first appeared in Fritz Lang's movie 'Frau im Mond' (usual English translation 'The Girl in the Moon', although 'Woman' would be more accurate), and it appears to have been Lang's invention as a way to add suspense to a silent movie. The rocket experimenters at the VfR (<i>Verein f&uuml;r Raumschiffahrt</i> or <i>Society for Space Travel</i>) picked it up, and it spread from there, gradually elaborated into a lengthy pre-launch schedule.&quot;]<p>

[Early countdowns did not have built-in holds. However, the countdown, even in the early years of rocketry, was not just a clock ticking down toward launch, it specified when various things happened pre-launch. During development, operational missiles suffered inevitable delays due to minor snags cropping up, despite their supposedly predictable schedules. While difficulties were ironed out, the count had to be paused, holding up other events. By building pauses into the count at carefully chosen times, engineers could use this time to appraise problems and deal with them appropriately when this would not cause trouble. A simple way to implement such a pause is to stop the clock.]<p>

[The built-in hold became firmly established in the launch event schedule during the Gemini program, when it was important that launches of the spacecraft and their rendezvous target vehicles, the Agenas, were carefully choreographed and had to be on time.]</font></blockquote>

<font color="#008000">

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;As far as the Apollo 15 crew is concerned, the crew was awakened by their boss, Donald K. Slayton, as planned in the countdown at 4:19 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. They were given a brief physical exam by Dr. Jack Keegan a short time later and he declared them in excellent physical condition and very well rested. The crew then sat down to breakfast with a number of the astronaut members of the back-up team and support team who have worked so hard with them in preparation for the mission and then were ready to proceed to the suit laboratory to don their pressure suits and go through final checks prior to being ready to go to the launch pad. Once again as planned in the countdown they departed the crew quarters at 6:28 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, arrived at the pad about 18 minutes later and then went onboard the spacecraft at about the 2&frac12; hour mark in the count. Since that time, Scott, Worden and Irwin have been performing various checks, working with the spacecraft control team, and all these checks have gone well. Our status is excellent at this time. The weather forecast certainly a Go for launch with clear skies, clear to scattered skies, the surface winds about 10 miles per hour from the south and the weather situation on the worldwide track as far as contingency purposes all Go. That's our status [at] T minus 37 minutes, 35 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;</font><p>

<font color="#008000">

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control at T minus 31 minutes and counting. T minus 31 on mission with Apollo 15; still Go. This is the fourth flight intended for a lunar landing and all is going well. [Strictly speaking, this is the fifth flight, as Apollo 13 was intended for a lunar landing until its explosion aborted the mission.] We're still aiming toward our planned T-zero at 9:34 a.m. EDT, when, if all goes well, those 5 big engines in the first stage of the Saturn 5 will ignite, generating more than 7.7 million pounds [34,250 kN] of thrust to start us on the way on a long trip to the Moon. 30 minutes, 25 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;
</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[<a name="sic"></a>Of the 110.6 metre height of the entire Apollo 15/Saturn V stack, 42.1 metres comprise the S-IC first stage. Five F-1 engines are clustered at the bottom of the stage to provide 34,025 kN (7,700,000 pounds) of thrust in total. The propellants used are RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly refined kerosene) as the fuel and LOX as the oxidiser. The lower of two tanks is filled with 810,000 litres of RP-1 at T-13 hours with a final topping up occurring at T minus 1 hour. At nine hours before launch, the larger upper tank has nitrogen gas pumped through it to purge it of air and water vapour contaminants. Six and a half hours before launch, it is precooled to prepare it for the loading of 1.3 million litres of LOX at a temperature of -183&deg; C. Initially, the LOX is fed at a slow rate of 95 litres per second until the tank is sufficiently chilled to retain the liquid up to 6.5% full, then the tank is filled to 98% at a rate of 630 litres per second, a process lasting over 45 minutes. The slow fill rate is reestablished until the tank is full at about 4 hours 55 minutes before launch. From then on, until three minutes before launch, the level is replenished as the volatile LOX boils off. Both of the first stage tanks are then pressurised prior to launch using helium; the fuel tank at T-96 seconds, the LOX tank at T-72 seconds.]</font></blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control. T minus 26 minutes and counting. We are still proceeding very satisfactorily here in the final minutes of the countdown. All still going well. The busy activity right now, [is] astronaut Al Worden giving final verification of the status of the propellant system onboard the Apollo spacecraft. He's working with Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin, giving the key readings on the various systems, temperatures and pressures to assure that that Reaction Control System is Go for the launch. They [the RCS] will have a lot of work to do during the mission and we wanted to make sure that it is precisely right before we are ready to commit the launch. Skip Chauvin now informs the astronauts that we are still about 10 minutes ahead in the countdown, and Dave Scott replies back with a rather quick 'Roger'. The countdown is still going. Launch vehicle status is Go. 25 minutes, 2 seconds and counting, and this is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;<p>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control; T minus 20 minutes, 56 seconds and counting. All aspects of the count are still Go, still aiming toward our plan T-zero at the appointed time of 9:34 a.m. Astronaut Al Worden ... Worden, the Command Module Pilot in the middle seat, has completed his checks of the pressurization system for the reaction controls of the Apollo spacecraft and all is still going well. Here in the Launch Control Center, the crew has started a sequence to chill down the upper two stages of the Saturn V because of the extremely low temperatures of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen involved in the propellant system and it is necessary to condition the engine chambers in both the second and third stages so that they will be at a lower temperature when the propellants are introduced at ignition time during the powered stage of the flight. We'll have more than 11 minutes of powered flight in the first stage of the mission [not the first stage of the launch vehicle], before the spacecraft - the Apollo spacecraft is placed into a parking orbit some 90 nautical miles [166 km] high, still attached to the third stage [of the launch vehicle]. A second burn of that third stage of the Saturn V will place the spacecraft on its proper translunar trajectory. Our status; 19 minutes, 40 seconds and counting, all aspects still Go. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[<a name="sii"></a>The second, or S-II, stage of Apollo 15's Saturn V vehicle is 24.9 metres tall and is powered by the combustion of LH<sub>2</sub> (liquid hydrogen) and LOX in a cluster of five J-2 rocket motors which generate a total thrust of 5,115kN (1.15 million pounds). A million litres of LH<sub>2</sub>, cooled to -253&deg;C to get it into a liquid state, is loaded into the large, upper tank of the stage while 331,000 litres of LOX is loaded into the smaller, squat tank below. These tanks share a single insulated structure with only an insulated, common bulkhead between them. With both propellants being so cold - LH<sub>2</sub> is only 20 degrees above absolute zero - the tanks must be prepared and chilled down before they can be filled.]<p>

[Air and water vapour is purged from the tanks by repeated pressurisation and venting with helium. Helium is used because nitrogen would freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen. Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold gas through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it. Seven hours before launch, LOX is fed at 31.5 litres per second until it is 5% full, then the fill rate goes to 315 litres per second to take the tank to 96% full. This takes about 25 minutes and then the tank is topped up at 63 litres per second. Five hours before launch and after purging and cooling, LH<sub>2</sub> enters at 63 litres per second, further cooling its tank so that propellant begins to remain liquid and rise in level in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. Once the level of liquid propellant reaches 5 percent, the fill rate is increased to 630 litres per second until the tank is 98 percent full, when the fill rate reduces again to 63 litres per second to top off the tank's load. To compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before launch when the tanks are pressurised. Up to the launch, pressurising helium gas is supplied from the ground. After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure until the engines are ignited 2 minutes and 40 seconds into the flight.]<p>

[<a name="iu"></a>Atop the S-IVB stage, a ring 1 metre high and the same diameter as the stage, called the IU (Instrument Unit), carries the guidance and control electronics for the Saturn V. Particularly important among these are the LVDC (Launch Vehicle Digital Computer) and the inertial platform, the ST-124, which has to be aligned to the intended trajectory before launch. The angle between north and the groundtrack of the vehicle's flight path is called the flight azimuth. For this launch, it is to be 80.088&deg; or slightly north of east. The gyroscopically stabilised platform at the heart of the ST-124 is aligned with the intended azimuth just prior to launch by rotating the X stable member with reference to a theodolite mounted some distance away from the launch pad. There is a small window in the skin of the Instrument Unit for this purpose.]<p>

[At T - 20 minutes, the Boost Preparation checklist deals with alignment of the X Stable Member Azimuth and checks that the various RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters on the side of the Service Module (SM) are powered from the two main electrical busses in such a fashion to allow maximum RCS control, should one bus lose power.]</font></blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control. The 16 minute mark has just been passed. We're at 15 minutes, 53 seconds and counting. The astronaut crew standing by for some important functions that will be coming up in a minute or so as the Apollo spacecraft goes on full internal power on the fuel cells [which are] onboard. Up to this time in the countdown, an external power source also has been applied to conserve those fuel cells. The external power source is removed. The astronauts will take a look at the status of their power system onboard and report it back to the Spacecraft Control Center. The astronauts also will arm their hand controllers onboard the spacecraft, and we will be ready to proceed to also place the Emergency Detection System on its automatic mode. Our countdown is still proceeding very satisfactorily as we come up on the 15 minute mark. The flight azimuth is the same. About 5 minutes ago there was an update given to the spacecraft computer. No changes were required because our countdown is right on time. 14 minutes, 53 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[The crew is checking the final status of the electrical system and the setup of the FDAI (Flight Director Attitude Indicator). This instrument, often called the &quot;8-ball&quot;, is similar to the ball-style artificial horizon found on many aircraft and, likewise, allows determination of the spacecraft's attitude with respect to a desired frame of reference, usually this will be the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) though it may be the GDC (Gyro Display Coupler), a device which displays the spacecraft's attitude compared to a crew preselected attitude. The FDAI will also show attitude errors and the rates of change of attitude.]</font></blockquote>

<font color="#008000">

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control. T minus 10 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. Countdown still running smoothly as astronaut Dave Scott onboard the spacecraft checks out a key abort circuit. [This is probably the Astro Launch Operations Voice Check at the bottom of the CSM Boost Preparation checklist.] This is a special communications system with only about 3 or 4 people on it. These are the people who can recommend an abort to the spacecraft commander if required. These people include the Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly, the spacecraft communicator here in the [Launch] Control Center, astronaut Vance Brand, Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin, and Houston Flight Director Gerry Griffin. We've checked out this special communication system and Dave Scott confirms that all is well.&quot;
</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Astronaut Vance Brand, the back-up CMP, communicates with the spacecraft from the LCC (Launch Control Center), five kilometres from the launch pad. In Mission Control, Houston, astronaut Gordon Fullerton is designated the CapCom for the first part of the mission and is awaiting the moment when the ascending vehicle will clear the tower it has stood next to and control of the mission transfers from the LCC to Houston.]</font></blockquote>

<font color="#008000">

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;The countdown [is] proceeding. Jim Irwin [is] now reading off some checks on the status of the fuel cells as we continue to go. We'll go on an automatic sequence here in the countdown starting at the 3 minute, 7 second mark on the count. From that time down, we will be automatic, with the countdown given by the computer. This will wind up with ignition of those 5 engines in the first stage at the 8.9 second mark in the countdown. The engines will build up to their full thrust, the computer will make a determination that we have 90% thrust in all 5 engines and that will be the signal for commit or to release the vehicle. Our countdown still proceeding; 9 minutes, 33 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;
</font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[<a name="sivb"></a>The third stage of the Saturn V, called the S-IVB for historical reasons, could be described as a smaller version of the S-II stage in that it also consists of a single tank structure with a common bulkhead between the LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX compartments. These propellants, which are stored at the same supercold temperatures as for the S-II, are burned in a single J-2 engine which yields a thrust of 890 kN (a shade over 200,000 pounds). The engine's capability for restarting is utilised for the boost out of Earth orbit to the Moon. The construction of the S-IVB's propellant tank differs from the S-II stage by having the insulation on the inside of the tank's metal skin, a detail which made manufacture easier by not having to develop a bonding system which had to work at only 20 degrees above absolute zero. With the insulation between it and the propellant, it would be substantially warmer. About 8 hours before launch, the cryogenic systems of the S-IVB stage are purged, including the engine feeds and pump cavities. At T minus seven and a half hours, the LOX tank is precooled by pumping LOX onboard at 31.5 litres per second and allowing its conversion to a gas to take away heat from the tank. When enough liquid remains to fill the tank to 5%, the fill rate goes to 63 litres per second, the fast fill rate, until the tank is 98% full. Finally the tank's total capacity of 92,350 litres is reached at a slow fill rate of up to 19 litres per second, and after that, replenished at a rate of up to 2 litres per second. The LOX tank filling takes about 25 minutes. Filling of the 253,200 litres of LH<sub>2</sub> follows a similar process beginning 4 hours and 11 minutes before launch. Tank precooling and filling to 5% is achieved with a fill rate of 31.5 litres per second, before the fast filling of the tank at 190 litres per second takes the tank's quantity to 98% three and a half hours before launch. The slow rate of fill is reestablished to top off the tank and keep it replenished. LH<sub>2</sub> tank pressurization is maintained, during initial flight, by the boil-off of the fuel, then later with helium from a collection of spheres mounted on the exterior of the thrust structure at the base of the stage. The LOX tank is pressurised from heated helium fed from cold storage tanks within the LH<sub>2</sub> tank.]</font></blockquote>

<b>Public Affairs Officer</b> - &quot;This is Kennedy Launch Control; T minus 5 minutes, 55 seconds and counting. We're still Go. Just - we're about to come up with some status checks now to determine the final status. In the meantime, the Lunar Module test conductor, Fritz Widick has come in over the circuits, and [has] informed the spacecraft Commander, Dave Scott, that Lunar Module <i>Falcon</i> and the Rover are Go. Dave Scott thanked him for this and then also received a report from Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin that the command ship, which will have the call sign <i>Endeavour</i>, also is Go. We've just completed our status report and the Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly, the Launch Director Walt Kapryan and the Mission Director Chet Lee, all have given their Go's. We're standing by for the swing arm to retract to its full fallback position. It's moving now as we approach the 5 minute mark in the count. Coming up on the 5 minute mark. Mark: T minus 5 minutes and counting. We're Go on Apollo 15. This is Kennedy Launch Control.&quot;

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[<a name="mobilelauncher"></a>The Saturn V launch vehicle is assembled, transported on, and launched from the Mobile Launcher. This structure consists of a base platform 48.8 x 41.1 metres and 7.6 metres high with a 13.7 metre square hole over which the vehicle is mounted. (The platforms were later converted for use by the Space Shuttle.) Sprouting from one end of this platform is the LUT (Launch Umbilical Tower). This 116 metre tower bears nine swing arms which provide the ground crew with access points to the vehicle, and a wide range of services including fuel, LOX, hydraulics, electrical power and various gases for purging and pressurization. These arms are articulated so they can swing away from the vehicle to give it clearance as it rises, and to protect them from the rocket's white hot exhaust gases. The crew enter the spacecraft via the top, or ninth, arm, which carries an environmentally controlled room at its end. Known as the &quot;white room&quot;, it covers the CM hatch until the crew is aboard. 43 minutes before launch, it is swung away from the spacecraft by 12&deg;. Five minutes before launch, it completes its retraction to 180&deg;, on the opposite side of the tower from the Saturn V.]<p>

[The Flight Plan indicates that in the CM, the five launch vehicle indicator lights are illuminated at T - 4 minutes, 10 seconds. Throughout powered flight, these lights, arranged to resemble the pattern of the engine clusters on the S-IC and S-II stages, will provide the commander with cues about the progress of the boost and the status of each engine in each stage. Readers can familiarize themselves with this subpanel through the movie <i>Apollo 13.</i> Two events in the film that focus on this panel are when Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell, Apollo 13's commander) manually jettisons the Launch Escape Tower, and when the inboard engine of the S-II stage prematurely shuts down. Then we see one of the few flaws in this movie, otherwise known for its incredibly high standards of accuracy. The central light is shown to blink on and off. In reality, it simply changes from on to off or vice versa.]<p>

[Dave Scott, from 1998 correspondence - &quot;In <i>Apollo 13,</i> the movie, the light was purposely made to blink to get the viewers attention - the movie-makers knew the actual operation, but chose to take this license for dramatic effect (actually a pretty good license, as otherwise, the viewer would have missed the point!).&quot;]</font></blockquote>

<font color="#000080">[<a name="f1desc"></a>First, a description of the engine. A large combustion chamber and bell have an injector plate at the top, through which, RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a gas generator. After powering the turbine, the exhaust gas passes through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds it into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself. Above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump with two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets going, via shutoff valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these 'feeds' supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid, though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground for this purpose. At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator. The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel. Lastly, an igniter, containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid with burst diaphragms at either end, is in the high pressure fuel circuit and has its own inject point in the combustion chamber. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15% triethylaluminium.]<p>

[<a name="f1start"></a>At T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer fires four pyrotechnic devices. Two cause the fuel rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters the engine bell. Another begins combustion within the gas generator while the fourth ignites the exhaust from the turbine. Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, starting it to rotate, then into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes a valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and accelerate the turbine. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve, letting fuel pressure reach the hypergol cartridge which promptly ruptures. Hypergolic fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its port where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.]</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the buildup of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.]</font></blockquote>

A pneumatic device, backed up by an explosive, collapses the lever linkage to allow the arm to rise. Additionally, a number of controlled-release mechanisms (up to 16, depending on the mission) prevent the vehicle from accelerating too rapidly in the first moments of motion. These consist of tapered pins mounted to the pad which are pulled through dies mounted on the vehicle. The deformation of the pins controls the initial acceleration for the first 150 mm of flight; a simple and ingenious arrangement.]</font></blockquote>

This yaw, begun 1.35 seconds after lift-off, maneuvers the vehicle 1.25&deg; from vertical in a direction away from the tower to ensure clearance in case a gust of wind pushes it back or a swing arm doesn't fully retract. Then nine seconds into the flight, almost as the rising rocket clears the tower, the stack is brought vertical again. To those who were not prepared for it, this fully intended yawing of over 110 metres of metal, filled to the brim with exotic fuels and oxidisers, could sometimes cause some consternation. The launch checklist for the CSM calls for the initiation of this yaw to be reported to the ground but the transcript does not carry it.]<p>

During launch, the A-15 CDR Cue Card indicated :00 - lift-off, and then next :11 - Roll. Therefore, in summary, there was no &quot;yaw&quot; transmission to the ground. How this got into the &quot;checklist&quot; I do not know, but as the missions wore on, &quot;interested parties&quot; were able to get into the loop. During the early days of Apollo, the crew only prepared the &quot;checklist,&quot; which was later approved by the Crew Procedures Change Board.

[Scott, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;My evaluation, compared to Apollo 9 [on which he flew as CMP], was that the lift-off itself was softer and quieter. When the tiedowns went, we could feel definite motion, but it didn't seem like as much as it was on Apollo 9.&quot;]<p>

[Woods, from 1998 correspondence with Scott - &quot;Could the difference between your perception of Apollo 9's and Apollo 15's lift-off be due to the greater weight of the stack in the latter mission?&quot;]<p>

[Scott, from 1998 correspondence - &quot;Unlikely - there are probably many other variables with greater influence on the 'feel' of a launch - each launch seemed to have its own unique characteristics, even each mission. The crew reports after each mission were, among other uses, factored into the simulators - which to subtle, but perceptible, degrees were changed in some form after each mission - like sounds of thrusters, sometimes louder and sometimes softer. Also, the added mass in percent was probably less than temperature and wind changes in percent - on any given launch. &quot;]</font></blockquote>

The value of this arrangement was dramatically demonstrated on <i>Apollo 12</i> when, during the early seconds of the flight, lightning temporarily knocked out the CM's electrical system, causing the CM's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to tumble and lose its pointing reference.

[Throughout the powered ascent of the launch vehicle, there are various modes of aborting the mission, each of which are appropriate to the current height and speed. For the first two of these modes, IA and IB, the Flight Plan defines the safe range of vehicle motion rates as not exceeding &plusmn;4&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll. Motion rates exceeding these limits will entail an abort.]<p>

[<a name="mode1a"></a>The initial 42 seconds, to an altitude of about 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) are flown in abort Mode IA (one alpha). If a dangerous situation occurs within this period, the CM would separate from the SM, and the LET (Launch Escape Tower, or just 'tower'), which is the solid-fuelled rocket mounted on top of the CM, would carry it up from the wayward launch vehicle while a small 'pitch control' motor at the top of the LET steers the assembly east out over the ocean and away from a possibly exploding booster below. The tower would be jettisoned only 14 seconds after the initiation of the abort. While this is going on, the highly dangerous hypergolic propellants of the Command Module's RCS would quickly and automatically be dumped overboard as they would be harmful to the recovery forces. The CM would then descend on parachutes to a normal splashdown.]<p>

[<a name="mode1b"></a>Abort Mode IB extends from 42 seconds into the flight to an altitude of 30.5 km (16.5 nautical miles) as defined by the abort checklist. With the vehicle being further downrange and tilted over, the pitch control motor would not be required in the event of a IB abort. However, it had been discovered during hypersonic testing, that the CM/LET stack could be aerodynamically stable in a tower-first as well as a base-first attitude so a pair of canards were added which would be deployed automatically to force the combination into an attitude where the base of the CM is facing the direction of travel, ready for the safe deployment of the drogue and main parachutes. While the canards have little effect in a low altitude abort, they become increasingly important as the Saturn V gains speed through the IB mode.]<p>

[Scott, from 1998 correspondence - &quot;The 'abort' function was so very critical in terms of success/failure that many people thought there should be no crew function, and it should all be automatic (which in turn would introduce other more consequential failure modes). The most difficult simulations during the entire training process were 'launch aborts' - even more so than lunar landings (the landing itself was more difficult than launch, but not for 'aborts'). More crews 'bought it' during launch sims than any other area, by far!&quot;]</font></blockquote>

[Worden, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;I guess the shaking of the S-IC was a little bit more than I expected. More lateral shaking, a little more vibration than I expected right at lift-off. When we got away from the tower and got away, maybe from some ground effects, whatever it was, it smoothed down.&quot;]<p>

[During the ascent through the atmosphere, it is important that the rocket points straight into the direction of its motion, and avoids flying sideways, even slightly, lest aerodynamic forces overload its structure. This is achieved by flying the first stage, and the start of the second stage, according to a carefully calculated, preprogrammed tilt schedule.]<p>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Towards the end of the S-IC's boost phase, two factors serve to gradually increase the acceleration experienced onboard. First, the atmosphere is becoming essentially a vacuum, reducing the backpressure the exhaust gases have to fight against compared to the air pressure at sea level. This improves the efficiency of the engines so that from launch to cut-off, S-IC thrust rises 19% from 34,250 kN to about 40,700 kN. Second, the S-IC tanks are emptying, lightening the launch vehicle and presenting less inertia to the thrust. To alleviate these rising acceleration forces and the shock of all five engines shutting down simultaneously, the centre engine of the cluster is shut down 23.5 seconds earlier than the outboard engines. The outboard engines cutoff at 2:39.6, staging occurs at 2:40.7 and the second stage ignition command is at 2:41.8.]<p>

[Another effect of the reduced air pressure on the S-IC is visible on movie coverage of the launch as the base of the vehicle appears to be progressively consumed by the conflagration. Near the ground, the plume is constrained by air pressure into a narrow flame extending rearwards. With decreasing air pressure, the hot gases are able to expand into an ever widening plume. Towards the end of the S-IC's flight, the air is so thin and the slipstream so negligible that a small amount of exhaust is able to expand forwards up the side of the rocket's structure giving the appearance, on TV coverage, of the rocket's base being consumed by the plume.]<p>

[The spent S-IC has lifted the vehicle to about 70 km; above most of the atmosphere. The S-II will continue the ascent to the orbital height of about 170 km, as well as accelerating the vehicle to about 90% of the velocity required to achieve a stable orbit.]</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[The term &quot;Good stage&quot; is used to mean that one stage of the stack is spent and has been separated from the rest of the rocket to allow the stage above it to take over the task of acceleration. The tilt sequence, which has defined the trajectory throughout the flight so far, has brought the rocket's slow, pre-programmed tilting motion to a halt so that during staging, it's attitude is stable which avoids complicating the event with unwanted rotation of the vehicle.]<p>

[<a name="sicsep"></a>The S-IC/S-II staging sequence for AS-510 differed markedly from earlier missions. On previous flights, the interstage, or skirt, a 4.9-metre tall ring matching the 10-metre diameter of the S-IC and S-II that it sits between, carried solid-fuel rockets which fired shortly after the first stage separated to settle the S-II propellants in their tanks. AS-501 and AS-502 had eight of these ullage rockets, while AS-503 to AS-509 had four. They were deleted from the Apollo 15 launch vehicle, along with four of the eight retro rockets built into the conical engine fairings around the base of the S-IC, in order to save weight and increase payload. Ullage is a brewers' term for the portion of a barrel occupied by air, not liquor. The separation did not quite go according to plan. After the F-1 engines were shut down, the thrust they generated during the tail-off period was greater than expected. The engines don't instantly stop thrusting when they receive their cut-off command. After a quick drop to about 2% thrust, they take over four seconds to decay to zero. As the engines expired, the acceleration imparted to the, now separate, empty and therefore light S-IC stage was above the predicted value. Despite deliberately coasting for longer than usual between separation and S-II ignition, the distance between the two stages was less than engineers had planned and the blast of hot gases from five J-2s against the top of the empty stage disabled a telemetry package with which the S-IC was to be monitored until its impact with the Atlantic Ocean.]<p>

[<a name="skirtsep"></a>Staging of the S-IC and S-II is technically described as a &quot;dual plane separation,&quot; as the vehicle is cut across two geometrical planes. The first plane is between the skirt and the S-IC, with the S-II engines starting 1.1 seconds later. The second plane separation, when the second stage loses the skirt, occurs at 3 minutes, 10.7 seconds; 30.0 seconds after the S-IC separation. This time allows the S-II's attitude to stabilise because if either part of the launch vehicle were to be yawing or pitching excessively, there would be a danger of the engine bells striking the S-IC and skirt as the two great metal cylinders coast along before ignition of the S-II. The skirt provides clearance above the first stage's LOX tank for the five J-2 engines of the S-II stage.]</font></blockquote>

[<a name="j2desc"></a>The S-II stage carries five J-2 uprated engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce up to 1,041 kN (234,000 pounds) thrust each. They are capable of being restarted in flight but this feature is only implemented in the engine used in the S-IVB.]</font><p>

<font color="#000080">[The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together in a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously prewarm the fuel. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants. The hot gas exhaust is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell. The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the solid steel injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this carries 614 posts which pass LOX through the injector and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The fuel delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent seeps through the injector face to cool it, the rest passing through the annular orifices.]<p>

[The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter), fed with propellant and mounted to the injector face, provides a flame to initiate full combustion. Valves are provided to bleed propellant through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings. A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen. This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves while the hydrogen spins up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust down to 890 kN (200,000 pounds) during flight to optimise engine performance.]<p>

[<a NAME="j2start"></a>To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the role of the engine. A one second delay is used for the S-II engines. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14&deg; allowing LOX to begin burning with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14&deg; is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.]</font></blockquote>

[<a name="pogo"></a>Being a huge, long, metal structure in a very dynamic environment, with large quantities of fluid moving inside at speed, the stack is prone to vibrations along its length. This lengthwise stretching and squeezing is known as &quot;Pogo&quot; from its similarity to the spring action of the &quot;Pogo stick,&quot; a contemporary child's toy. The structure itself vibrates at particular frequencies which, as the fuel tanks empty, sweep through a substantial range. Other variables, such as vehicle and payload mass, and propellant characteristics, make it exceedingly difficult to predict the frequency and magnitude of these pogo oscillations.]<p>

[Many launch vehicles suffer pogo problems during development and the Saturn V was never completely free of it. The S-II, in particular, exhibited severe pogo which plagued the early flights.

[The four flush mounted S-band antennas are used for near Earth communication and as a back-up to deep space communication. There is a capability for the ground to switch between antenna D and one which has been manually selected by the crew. Normally, the crew would select antenna B, which is on the opposite side of the spacecraft to D. Then, as one antenna goes away from line of sight of the Earth, the other will come into view and the ground can take care of antenna selection. However, if the crew manually selects antenna D, then the ground effectively lose control of which antenna is being used at any particular time.]</font></blockquote>

It is part of a strategy to make sure that as little propellant as possible is left in the tanks when the second stage has done its work.

During ascent on the previous stages, LH<sub>2</sub> tank pressure is maintained by boil-off of the liquid hydrogen itself.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[The crew is consulting their computer's DSKY (display and keyboard), as required by the checklist, which tells them that they have achieved a slightly eccentric orbit of 93.7 nautical miles (173.4 km) by 88.9 nautical mile (164.5 km) and their velocity is currently 25,595 feet per second. H dot is the derivative of height with respect to time - essentially the rate of change of height - and, at 8 feet per second, is small as would be expected for a nearly circular orbit. The current altitude is 93.2 nautical miles (172.5 km). The IU is giving a slightly different answer which Mission Control have observed through telemetry and which has been confirmed by radar. This is a very low orbit and one which cannot be sustained for long due to the friction with the tenuous air at this altitude. Indeed, there is significant heating on the skin of the vehicle due to atmospheric friction. However, this is considered acceptable for the three hours duration of the parking orbit and the low altitude allows the Saturn to carry a greater payload.]</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Comm break.]<p>

[On attaining orbit, the APS (Auxiliary Propulsion System, the S-IVB's own attitude control system), begins a maneuver to rotate the vehicle from the 18&deg; pitched down attitude at shutdown of the S-IVB, to the local horizontal (i.e. with respect to the Earth's surface below). This maneuver is greater on Apollo 15 than the 6&deg; to 10&deg; noted on previous flights, due to the lower altitude of the final orbit, and is carried out at a rate of 0.3&deg; per second. However, the large size of the maneuver helps develop a slosh wave within the nearly three quarters full LOX tank and about 220 kilograms of LOX is lost through an intentionally open vent. Future missions would rotate the stack at only 0.14&deg; per second to minimise propellant sloshing.]<p>

[The APS then sets up a slow pitch rotation at a rate which matches the vehicle's rate of rotation about the Earth (therefore called 'orb rate') so that throughout the orbit, the same side keeps facing Earth. In this case the crew is in a 'heads down' attitude and the vehicle is pointing in the direction of travel.]<p>

[There seem to be a number of interrelated reasons for the orb rate maneuver during the Earth parking orbit. As we have seen, making large attitude changes to the very full S-IVB is to be avoided to inhibit sloshing in the tanks. Already, nearly a quarter of a tonne of LOX has been lost. They entered orbit nearly &quot;pointy-end-forward&quot; and will boost to the Moon (the TLI or Translunar Injection burn) in a similar attitude. Staying in that same attitude, relative to the local horizontal, avoids excessive attitude changes. Also, this attitude presents a small cross section to the extremely thin atmosphere that the spacecraft and S-IVB is still moving through, and this minimises friction induced heating. It may be preferable for the small thrust resulting from the venting of LH<sub>2</sub> to push the vehicle in the same direction as orbital motion. Finally, keeping the CSM in a 'heads down' attitude ensures that the spacecraft's optics, mounted on the opposite side of the Command Module from the hatch, are facing towards the stars so Al can sight on them during the upcoming navigation tasks.]<p>

[Woods - &quot;there was a propulsive vent going on the whole time while you were in Earth orbit. They were venting the boil-off as a propulsive vent, partly to settle the propellants.

[Scott - &quot;That torques the CSM guidance platform to your nominal orientation - the orientation you want after insertion because it may have drifted during launch. Before launch, you gyrotorque down to the last minute so that everything's aligned. And then you go through the launch and you get all this vibration and all that stuff. I think what they do when you get into orbit is to torque it again to null again all the drift and bias built up during launch.&quot;]<p>
