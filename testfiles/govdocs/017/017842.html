<CENTER>An address before the Annual Meeting

<P>of the Aerospace Medical Association</P>

<P>Detroit, Michigan</P>

<P>17 May 1999</P></CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Good morning! It is a pleasure to be here and to have the
opportunity to address such a meeting of aerospace professionals. We
are here today, in part, to celebrate an organization that has, for
seventy years, pioneered in studying and applying aerospace medicine
to the problems of flight. When, at 10 a.m., on the morning of
October 7, 1929, Louis Bauer called the first annual meeting of the
"Aero Medical Association" to order in the old Statler Hotel in this
city, about 60 physicians were present. Look around: we see how
successful this organization has been, how compelling his vision was,
how demanding the need has been for the aerospace medicine
professional, in those who are here today. That year was a remarkable
one in aviation, for only a week before, test pilot Jimmy Doolittle
had completed the first blind flight in aviation history, a triumph
of technology and courage that incorporated more than a little
aerospace medicine itself. Today, seventy years later, this
organization has, appropriately enough, changed its name to reflect
the aerospace revolution. We are an aerospace nation, we are, indeed,
an aerospace world. There is very little in this world that is
unaffected by the revolution in flight.</P>

<P>The airplane has flown for little less than a century, yet, in
that time, it has radically reshaped the world in which we live.
Several weeks ago, at a fete offered by <I>Time Magazine</I> honoring
their notable cover people, Bill Gates of Microsoft saluted the
Wright brothers as the inventors of the first "World Wide Web." Now,
at first thought, that may seem a little extreme. But if we really
think of what has been accomplished in aerospace in this century, it
makes a great deal of sense. For example, if any one of us wished to
take a trip to Europe in the nineteenth century, such a venture
required great wealth, a tremendous amount of time, a great deal of
planning, and, frankly, not a little risk. Such voyages weren&#146;t
called "Grand Tours" for nothing. Yet today, you can&#146;t find room
to stow your briefcase on any transatlantic widebody for all the
backpacks of vacationing students. That&#146;s mass communication,
and, as Gates so perceptively noted, it&#146;s a direct outgrowth of
the aerospace revolution. And it has been a factor in world affairs
since 1958 when, for the first time, more people traveled across the
North Atlantic by air than by sea.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><I>A Brief Overview</I></CENTER>

<P>Revolutions require revolutionaries&#151;visionary figures that
transform a field of endeavor or who otherwise take advantage of
circumstances to change and alter previously accepted patterns of
behavior and thought. The aerospace revolution is a classic example
of this, and when it is examined in detail, we see that there was any
number of individuals whose international efforts, combined together,
worked to give to the world the ability to exploit the third
dimension. While the popular mind naturally gravitates to the
aeronauts, aviators, astronauts, and cosmonauts themselves, and the
inventors, designers, engineers, and technicians who developed the
remarkable flying machines that we have witnessed, there are many
others who have contributed to the explosive growth of aviation in
this century. In particular, the medical researcher and the medical
practitioner stand tall in this pantheon, for medicine and medical
concerns have been integral parts of the aerospace process since the
very dawn of flight itself.</P>

<P>Take Icarus, who, together with his father Daedalus, fashioned
crude wings to his arms using wax and feathers, and, flapping
furiously, took off from Crete. Before take-off a flight surgeon had
warned him not to fly too close to the sun, lest the wax melt and his
feathers fall off. But like many pilots since that time, he ignored
the advice, experienced structural failure from thermodynamic
effects, and got waxed in the process. So there is a long tradition
of mixing medicine and flight.</P>

<P>But seriously, it is worth noting a number of early aviation
pioneers were also medical practitioners or interested in medicine:
the Moorish physician Abbas b. Firnas, who completed a short glide in
the tenth century; the Renaissance futurist Leonardo da Vinci who
conceptualized ornithopters, helicopters, and parachutes; and
Giovanni Borelli, a 17<SUP>th</SUP> century mathematician who
undertook pioneering studies of human musculature.</P>

<P>Clearly the history of aerospace medicine and the history of
aerospace technology have advanced hand-in-hand. Put another way, the
challenges and accomplishments that constitute the development of
aerospace medicine have closely matched the challenging requirements
of flight as it has evolved from within the atmosphere to within the
harsh environment of near-Earth space. As you all recognize,
aerospace medicine involves many discrete specialties and numerous
major areas of practice and interest. In a broad sense, it ranges
from the physician screening candidates for civil or military pilot
training, to the aerospace health care professional supervising
patient care during medical evacuations, to the laboratory researcher
investigating g-induced loss of consciousness or the impact of
long-duration space missions upon human physiology.</P>

<P>What I would like to concentrate upon in my remaining time is the
relationship between aerospace medicine and the development of
aerospace technology. This relationship has been characterized
by:</P>

<P>--<I>Forced adaptation</I> to the opportunity afforded by rapid
technological development in aeronautics and astronautics,</P>

<P>--<I>Perceptive anticipation</I> of future medical requirements
for flight systems and human performance, and, finally,</P>

<P>--<I>Rapid advancement</I> of both fields: aerospace medicine as a
discipline within the health sciences, and aerospace technology as a
discipline within the matrix of engineering science and related
fields.</P>

<P>Specifically I would like to examine the twin problems of aircrew
safety and performance, particularly under high accelerations and at
high-altitudes; and escape and survival in the advent of catastrophe.
Several of the challenges within these two areas have struck me as of
particular significance in revealing the critical role that aerospace
medicine has played in aerospace development since Kitty Hawk and,
indeed, since the development of the first crude balloons not quite
216 years ago. Listed in rough chronological order&#151;for many
represent continuing concerns through the years&#151;we have the
following challenges:</P>

<P>--Ensuring aircrew safety and performance during high-altitude
flight.</P>

<P>--Studies of human susceptibility to disorientation during
so-called "blind" flight.</P>

<P>--Interest in acceleration effects during abrupt maneuvering
flight.</P>

<P>--Introduction of crude pressure suits and early pressure cabin
technology.</P>

<P>--Introduction of the g-suit to enhance combat survivability and
performance.</P>

<P>--Crew escape from high-altitude and at high-speeds.</P>

<P>--Development of practical partial and full-pressure pilot
protection suits and helmets for flight above 50,000 ft.</P>

<P>--Resolving problems of long-duration missions in zero-g
conditions and in conditions where spacecraft crews might be exposed
to solar radiation.</P>

<P>Clearly, many of these challenges overlap and display a high
degree of interrelatedness&#151;as well as a high degree of
persistence, in that they exhibit reoccurrence as the capabilities of
aerospace systems evolve.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><I>From Ballooning through the Great War</I></CENTER>

<P>The first notable work in aerospace medicine accompanied the
development of the balloon. While hot-air designs of the kind
pioneered in 1783 by the brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier
cooled so quickly once aloft that they remained essentially "low
altitude" systems, even the first crude cold-gas (hydrogen) balloons
were capable from the outset of reaching remarkably high-altitudes
for their time. Indeed, the very first balloonist to make an ascent
in a hydrogen balloon, French physicist J. A. C. Charles, climbed to
10,000 feet on December 1, 1783, his second voyage aloft. On this
thirty-minute journey, he grew so exceedingly cold that he could not
hold a writing pen, and developed a "violent pain in my right ear and
jaw" that forced him to valve off gas and descend. By the
mid-1860&#146;s, British balloonists had reached 25,000 feet, without
using oxygen though they clearly recognized its desirability; one
wrote that he had "experienced the limit of our power of breathing."
This led the French physician Paul Bert to create the first pressure
chamber capable of simulating ascents; this small test facility could
produce an equivalent altitude of 28,000 feet. Bert subsequently
undertook a variety of physiological experiments upon animal and
human test subjects, evaluating the effects of various concentrations
of oxygen, his efforts earning him recognition as the father of
aerospace medicine. Sadly, two of his disciples, who ignored his
advice to use oxygen throughout a high-altitude journey (and not just
when they felt the need) perished from oxygen deprivation at 28,000
feet in the flight of the French balloon <I>Zenith</I> in 1875.</P>

<P>Using a more cautious approach, two German balloonists, students
of the great Austrian physiologist Hermann von Schrotter, reached
34,500 feet in an open-gondola balloon in 1901, though even they
nearly died in the attempt. (Afterwards, von Schrotter recommended
all subsequent high-altitude balloons use a "hermetically sealed
gondola"). But even over a quarter-century after this, in 1927, lack
of adequate preparation and anticipation of flight conditions could
lead to tragedy, as the death of U.S. Army balloonist Hawthorne Gray
during an ascent to over 42,000 feet (using unpressurized oxygen
delivery systems and an open gondola) dramatically illustrated. For
aeronauts and aviators alike, the future of high-altitude flight
belonged to the pressurized cabin or the pressure suit.</P>

<P>The invention and subsequent international development of the
airplane occurred at a pace that is remarkable even today, in the era
of the electronic revolution. To illustrate this, in 1903 the Wrights
flew at Kitty Hawk, barely climbing higher than the height of a
person, and covering only eight hundred feet on their best flight of
the day, which lasted just short of a minute in duration. In 1908
they developed the first military airplane, demonstrating their
aircraft to astonished Europeans the following year. An Italian
military pilot flying a German-built airplane became the first airman
to attack enemy ground forces using bombs dropped from an airplane,
during the 1911 Italo-Turkish war over Tripoli. In 1914, eleven years
after Kitty Hawk, the two great battles that shaped the future
direction of the First World War, the battles of the Marne and
Tannenberg, were decided on the basis of aerial reconnaissance.
Aircraft served in a variety of roles during the First World War,
and, in 1919, there were no less than three flights across the North
Atlantic. In 1924, a small formation of U.S. Army biplanes circled
the globe.</P>

<P>Given what we now know about the limitations of human performance
at altitude, and what was even known at the time from balloon flights
and the work of individuals such as Bert and von Schrotter, it is
remarkable how cavalier the world&#146;s airmen were about flying at
high-altitudes in open-cockpit, unheated, and non-oxygen-equipped
aircraft. By 1917, combat patrols and dogfights at altitudes between
16,000 and 18,000 feet were commonplace, some missions lasting
upwards of 1-&#189; hours. Anoxia and hypothermia undoubtedly
contributed to loss rates (as evidenced by the number of pilots who,
in high-altitude combat, were taken by surprise, or showed little
recognition of what was happening around them, or who simply fell out
of control). The rigors of flying seem to have reduced pilot
resistance to more common ailments as well. For example, when
influenza swept with Western Front and British Isles in 1918, fighter
squadrons seem to have been particularly hard hit.</P>

<P>Confronting the world&#146;s first air war, medical researchers
concentrated on attributes of aircrew performance that they
considered significant, including vision, reaction time, heart rate
and respiration, and vestibular response, the latter then based on
the notion, later disproved, that the ear was more important than the
eye in providing cues to the pilot as to aircraft orientation.
Significantly, the United States introduced the innovation of having
medical personnel familiar with aviation and possessing actual flying
experience&#151;the first genuine flight surgeons.</P>

<P>By 1918, largely on the recommendations of medical personnel
coupled with the evidence of actual flying experience,
oxygen-breathing systems were beginning to appear in combat aircraft,
as were heated flying suits. Neither, however, was in widespread
service.</P>

<P>The interwar years witnessed dramatic changes in aircraft
capability and performance. Between the armistice in 1918 and the
outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, aircraft flight speeds
tripled, the airplane evolved from wood and fabric to rugged
all-metal construction, and from an open-cockpit to an enclosed cabin
design. By the end of the period, the turbojet engine promised an era
of 500+ mph flight speeds at altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet, and a
high-speed aerodynamic revolution offered the potentiality of
exceeding the speed of sound.</P>

<P>Numerous challenges confronted aircraft designers, aircrew,
aircraft operators, researchers, and medical personnel alike during
this time period. Early in the 1920&#146;s, the hazards of so-called
"blind flying" led to international efforts to develop a better
appreciation of pilot disorientation while operating in conditions
where no clear horizon existed. Often, even the threat of zero
visibility forced pilots to abandon their aircraft; as early British
aviator John Grierson recollected, "when the weather became bad or
the fuel ran out, the parachute was there to be used." As exemplified
by tests using the Jones-Barany revolving chair, aeromedical
researchers such as William Ocker and David Myers demonstrated that
safe blind flying was not something dependent upon the
individual&#146;s own vestibular system or something that could be
resolved physiologically by selecting a specially gifted individual
or by special physical training. Rather, it required faith: it
demanded a denial of the <I>perceived</I> motion generated by
physical cues in favor of an acceptance of the <I>revealed</I> motion
as indicated by onboard instrumentation.</P>

<P>This went very much against the pilot training culture of the
time. Charles Lindbergh recalled that flight instructors warned
students "A good pilot doesn&#146;t depend on his instruments," and
Harry Guggenheim, a World War I naval aviator whose postwar
philanthropic foundation played the key role in resolving the
challenge of blind flight, remembered his flight instructor stating
"See those instruments? Pay no attention to them. I want you to get
the feel of the ship regardless of instruments." It should not be
surprising, then, how many pilots became disoriented and spun
themselves into the ground.</P>

<P>Thanks to better appreciation of what a pilot needed, rapid
instrumentation development efforts both followed this initial
medical research and accompanied subsequent work: radio navigation
systems for long-range precision flying and precision letdowns to
landing, artificial horizons to compensate for the lack of a visible
horizon reference line, and precision altimeters to give accurate
vertical measurements. In September 1929, test pilot James H.
Doolittle completed the first blind flight in aviation history, an
epochal event ranking with the first supersonic flight in
demonstrating the mastery of what had heretofore been considered not
merely dangerous but perhaps impossible as well.</P>

<P>Related to this was the growing problem of accelerations in
flight. Structural failures of new generations of military aircraft
were commonplace; fortunately, the introduction of the personal
parachute kept fatalities reasonably low. Nevertheless, researchers
needed to understand the loads environment that these newer 200 mph+
encountered. In the course of this research, they discovered that it
was equally important to understand what was happening to the crew.
Early biplanes could exceed upwards of 7g in maneuvering flight, and
when the all-metal revolution increased the strength of aircraft
structures, the g limits rose appreciably. Thus, aeromedical
researchers were particularly interested in 1927 when test pilot Luke
Christopher of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics did an
abrupt stick-snatch at 173 mph in a Navy Curtiss Hawk fighter,
hitting 10.5g. Christopher suffered "generalized conjunctivitis of
both eyes", and a "mild cerebral concussion with some generalized
cerebral capillary hemorrhage," and required a month before fully
recovering. Interestingly, some high-speed air racing accidents
during tight pylon turns and crashes of dive-bombers (both in the
U.S. and Germany) during dive pullouts strongly suggest, from
today&#146;s perspective, possible g-induced loss of consciousness
(G-LOC).</P>

<P>Both in the United States and abroad, aeromedical researchers
increasingly relied upon flight testing, using specially instrumented
aircraft carrying test subjects to determine crew tolerance in
maneuvering flight to a variety of g levels sustained over time. Very
quickly they noted some of the characteristics we now associate with
high-g flight such as graying of vision, and vision "tunneling." This
generated growing interest in developing some sort of garment that
might offset, in a manner analogous to the primitive pressure suits
of the time, the limiting and, indeed, dangerous, effects of rapid g
onset, as will be discussed shortly.</P>

<P>The defining drive in aeronautics in the interwar period was the
goal of flying faster and further, which, of course, required flying
higher&#151;certainly above 30,000 feet. Even before the end of the
First World War, the emergence of the gear-and-turbo-driven engine
supercharger clearly established a technical ability for aircraft to
reach higher altitudes. This, of course, drove a great deal of
interest in protecting the pilot and passengers. Accordingly,
significant high-altitude research, using both aircraft and balloons,
occurred in virtually all advanced nations. Again, open-cockpit
unpressurized flights were risky in the extreme, and numerous close
calls characterized some of the flight tests. (In September 1934, for
example, Italian test pilot Renato Donati reached an altitude of
47,358 feet in an open-cockpit biplane, but had to be carried from
his plane after landing in a near-comatose condition, remaining so
for nearly a day).</P>

<P>Pressure suit development intrigued a number of researchers,
beginning with British physiologist J. B. S. Haldane, who had first
proposed such an approach to high-altitude flight as early as 1920.
In December 1934, wearing an experimental pressure suit with an
internal absolute pressure of 7 pounds per square inch (psi)
developed by B. F. Goodrich, Wiley Post reached an altitude of 48,000
feet, flying a supercharged Lockheed Vega monoplane, the famed
<I>Winnie Mae</I>. The next year, Post flew from Burbank, California,
to Cleveland, Ohio, cruising in the jet stream at an altitude in
excess of 30,000 feet. Post&#146;s suit is the direct ancestor of the
modern full-pressure "space suit." By the end of the decade, other
nations had flown generally similar suits, and, in 1938, Italian
pilot Mario Pezzi reached an altitude of 56,046 feet, a record that
still stands for a piston-engine airplane. But the suit, of course,
was far from practicable for commercial applications, or even
military ones.</P>

<P>Early pressure cabin research was hardly less risky than open
cockpit high-altitude flying. In 1921, one U.S. Air Service test
pilot discovered that his experimental pressurized aircraft worked
too well: the pressurization system generated an equivalent altitude
of &#150;3,000 feet below sea level! Although experiencing a great
deal of discomfort, the pilot was able to land safely, but the plane
never flew again. Balloonists had greater early success. Using a
sealed pressurized pure-oxygen gondola (in many ways, the predecessor
of the modern space vehicle), the Swiss physicist August Piccard
reached 51,775 feet in May 1931 in the research balloon <I>FNRS</I>,
accompanied by Paul Kipfer. The similarly designed American
<I>Explorer II</I> (which used a safer atmosphere of 46% oxygen and
54% nitrogen), crewed by Orvil Anderson and A. W. Stevens reached
72,395 feet in November 1935, a record, incidentally, that lasted
nearly sixteen years, until exceeded by the Douglas D-558-2
rocket-propelled research airplane.</P>

<P>The first successful pressurized cabin airplane was the Junkers Ju
49, which flew to over 41,000 feet in May 1929, piloted by Willi
Neuenhofen. The Ju 49, strictly experimental, had a small pressurized
"capsule" with vision portholes for its pilot inserted into the
structure of the aircraft. As for the United States, the death of
balloonist Hawthorne Gray in 1927 had profoundly affected the
engineering community at Wright Field, Ohio, and, under the
leadership of Carl Greene, they devoted increasing attention to
examining the potentiality for pressurized cabins. Greene and
research associate John Younger designed a special pressurized cabin
for use with a modified Lockheed Model 10 Electra twin-engine
transport, using engine-driven air compressors. This testbed, the
Lockheed XC-35, first flew in 1937, with a cabin that operated at a
pressure of 9.5 psi, affording its passengers the ability to fly well
above 30,000 feet in shirtsleeve comfort, without the need for oxygen
breathing systems. The advent of the XC-35 marked the emergence of
the practical pressurized cabin for high-altitude commercial and
military aircraft, a milestone event in aerospace history suitably
recognized by the award of the Collier Trophy to the XC-35 team in
1938. That same year, Boeing unveiled the world&#146;s first
production airliner designed for a pressurized fuselage, the Boeing
307 Stratoliner; the next year saw the first flight of a turbojet
airplane. That combination--the turbojet and the pressurized
cabin--would, in the 1950&#146;s, revolutionize international air
travel and, indeed, modern society.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><I>World War II and Into the Jet Age</I></CENTER>

<P>The Second World War constituted a crucible in the rapid
proliferation of aerospace medicine. It was the first conflict
employing the mass application of aerospace medicine in every role
from aircrew screening through medical research. Aerospace medical
thrusts during the war concentrated on two primary areas: improving
the ability of combat aircrew to fulfill military missions, and
protection of aircrew from the hazards of combat, high-altitude
flight, and emergency escape. The emergence of the pilot protection
anti-g suit, the development of better oxygen delivery systems and
masks, and the development of the first ejection seats all constitute
notable examples of research in these areas, but particularly the g
suit.</P>

<P>Ironically, few outside the medical community considered that g
forces might prove a serious safety and operational limitation in
fighter combat. During the late 1930&#146;s, for example, a senior
member of the Royal Air Force&#146;s Air Staff informed the Flying
Personnel Research Committee that modern fighter aircraft flew so
fast (then about 300 mph) that dogfights would be essentially
impossible. (Nor was the RAF alone in this; fighters in the
1930&#146;s were seen primarily as bomber interceptors, not as
aircraft that would clash in great numbers themselves. The FPRC
persisted in g-suit research, largely because scientists were aware
of a great deal of Nazi interest in acceleration effects due to the
<I>Luftwaffe&#146;s</I> investment in dive-bombers, and they
concluded that such a course of action was only prudent). In America,
the noted American aerospace practitioner and researcher, Harry G.
Armstrong, had undertaken a number of g effects studies using an
early centrifuge, as had the von Diringshofen brothers in Germany.
The lack of suitable centrifuge test facilities caused British
researchers to use both single and multiseat research airplanes
instead. The combined results of both ground and flight-testing
elaborated upon earlier work in the interwar years, and refined
understanding of gray-out and black-out. Further, testing
demonstrated the lasting effects accompanying over-g episodes,
notably mental confusion, lethargy, and fatigue, all of which could
become killers in the era of G-LOC. British researchers examined
various options to prevent blood pooling in the lower extremities.
These included fitting higher rudder pedals to operational fighter
aircraft to raise the legs during combat (which increased g tolerance
by more than 2g). Additionally, as early as 1940, they investigated
angled seats--shades of the F-16 over three decades subsequently!
--including one inclined at 45 degrees that enabled a pilot to
sustained 6g for 9 seconds without vision impairment or blacking
out.</P>

<P>Most serious medical researchers recognized that solving the g
onset challenge required developing an anti-g suit of some sort that
could prevent pooling of blood in the extremities. The pioneering
nations in this work were, primarily, Canada, Australia, and the
United States. The Canadian cancer researcher Wilbur Franks designed
a full-coverall, water-filled anti-g suit in 1939. In 1942, Royal
Navy fighter pilots employed a derivation of this suit during the
invasion of North Africa with great success, though, interestingly,
the RAF did not adopt it for fear pilots would overstress their
aircraft. In contrast, the Australian exercise physiologist Frank
Cotton derived a two-piece air-operated suit, which saw limited
service with the Royal Australian Air Force. After assessing the
merits of both the Franks and Cotton approach, American researchers
emphasized using a simpler "exoskeleton" air bladder system, creating
a lightweight and cool garment fed by air drawn from the
aircraft&#146;s engine intakes. The so-called G-2 and G-3A suits
entered service with the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944. Combat
experience indicated that, under identical combat conditions over the
same length of time, pilots wearing g-suits shot down twice as many
enemy fighters compared to pilots without them. (Nazi Germany,
despite all its interest and work on accelerations, did not employ a
combat g-suit during the war). G-suit use likewise cut incidences of
gray-out or black-out in half. One danger did exist: pilots could now
withstand a higher g loading than their Mustangs, raising the specter
of their inadvertently overstressing their airplanes.</P>

<P>By the end of the war, attention in aviation was turning to the
problems of very high-speed flight, in excess of Mach 1, at altitudes
higher than 50,000 feet. Here, the wartime investment in
high-altitude and high acceleration protection paid off quickly, but
new complications forced further work. For example, newer generations
of jet aircraft operating to higher altitudes required stronger
internal structures to permit a high level of pressure differential
to avoid the problem of dysbarism. Even so, as altitudes exceeded
50,000 feet, crews had either to rely upon partial-or-full-pressure
suits or, as with spacecraft, upon a completely sealed cabin, to
avoid both the danger of anoxia and, at higher altitudes,
vaporization of body fluids.</P>

<P>With this resurgent drive to altitude, a new problem grew in
seriousness: explosive decompression. This had occurred occasionally
during B-29 operations against Japan, typified by the blowing out of
windows, bubbles, and hatches, sometimes with fatal results for a
nearby crewman. But in the jet era, such decompression could be fatal
to an entire airplane and its crew, as evidenced by the tragedy of
the world&#146;s first production jet airliner, the De Havilland
Comet. A series of accidents claimed dozens of lives, and were
eventually traced to structural failure leading to decompression and
then the literally explosive disintegration of the fuselage. The
subsequent Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 family of transports, which
revolutionized intercontinental travel, was the direct beneficiaries
of the long and detailed accident investigation undertaken after the
Comet&#146;s mysterious crashes.</P>

<P>In 1949, during a high-altitude flight attempt, explosive
decompression nearly led to the loss of the first Bell X-1 aircraft;
pilot Frank Everest&#146;s life was saved by his partial pressure
suit. On a later flight of the more advanced X-1A, Chuck
Yeager&#146;s life was arguably saved by his g suit, which enabled
him to withstand punishing positive accelerations when the plane
tumbled completely out of control at Mach 2.44. Other ideas for crew
escape at high-altitude were less successful; for example, provision
of an escape capsule failed to save the life of Milburn Apt when his
X-2 research airplane likewise departed violently at Mach 3.2.</P>

<P>Much as a parachute had revolutionized aviation safety in the
early 1920&#146;s, the ejection seat--appearing in many nations,
starting with Nazi Germany in the Second World War--did so again in
the jet age. Initially fired using compressed air or a shell
cartridge system, the seat eventually evolved into a complex
aerospace system itself, with self-righting systems, rocket boost and
attitude controls, built-in oxygen for its occupant, automatic seat
disconnect systems and deployment systems for the crewman&#146;s
parachute, etc. The Korean War, the first jet air war, saw numerous
ejections of both Western and Communist pilots from aircraft stricken
by enemy fire or inflight failure. The value of automated seats was
well illustrated in 1955 by test pilot George Smith, who survived an
ejection in a near-vertical dive at Mach 1.05 and 6,000 feet from a
North American F-100A Super Sabre. The ejection imposed 64g forces on
the hapless pilot, with an onset rate of 700g per second. Rendered
unconscious and seriously injured, the pilot survived because the
seat automatically separated from him, and the &#145;chute
automatically deployed as well.</P>

<P>Acceleration research had continued after the Second World War and
had led to some experimental work in Europe and America on
prone-pilot tests to determine if such an awkward crew position may
improve resistance to g-onset. But, as the Smith ejection showed, the
most serious difficulty with acceleration in the early jet era was as
a result of having to escape. Ejection at both low and high-speed,
and at low and high-altitudes, presented numerous problems.
Essentially, aeromedical researchers had to provide seat designers
with information enabling them to design seats that could accelerate
a pilot away from a crashing airplane in any sort of flight attitude
The dynamic loadings experienced by the pilot were, of course, of
critical interest, as was the behavior of his protection
system--particularly his parachute and protective suit. In World War
II, W. Randolph Lovelace had survived deliberately parachuting from a
B-17 at over 40,000 feet to validate the use of a bail-out oxygen
bottle during a high-altitude descent, experiencing an unexpectedly
violent opening of his &#145;chute that knocked him unconscious and
stripped the gloves from his hands. Now, in the Lovelace tradition,
aeromedical researchers offered themselves up as test subjects to
resolve the problems of both low-and-high-altitude and
low-and-high-speed escape. In Britain, some proved out the operation
of the first low-altitude low-speed rocket ejection seats (which
eventually led to the so-called "zero-zero" seats of the present day)
capable of saving a pilot during ejections during takeoff or landing
at very low altitudes. One Royal Navy aeromedical researcher, J. S.
P. Rawlins, went a step further, and undertook extremely hazardous
ejection trials underwater to validate the operation of ejection
seats and oxygen systems as a means of escaping from sinking
carrier-based aircraft, nearly drowning several times in the
process&#151;but always going back.</P>

<P>The most notable of these researchers was, of course, John Paul
Stapp, who, at extreme personal risk, added greatly to understanding
of drag deceleration during high-speed bailouts at high dynamic
pressures ("q") by courageously subjecting himself to no less than 29
brutal rocket sled deceleration tests between 1947 and 1954. In the
course of these tests, facing both forwards and to the rear, he
suffered a variety of broken bones and sprains, retinal hemorrhage,
and concussion, yet continued to offer himself up as a test subject.
In December 1954, he experienced conditions only slightly less
strenuous than those which seriously injured George Smith a little
over two months later, during a test simulating pilot ejection at
1,000 mph at 40,000 feet. Stapp accelerated to 632 mph in five
seconds, then stopped in 1.1 seconds, imposing a peak g loading of
40g&#146;s, at a deceleration rate of 600g/sec. Stapp experienced a
variety of daunting short-term physiological symptoms as a result,
chief of which was acute eye pain that he equated to "extraction of a
molar without an anaesthetic." (Later, in 1961, facing rearwards, Eli
Breeding went even further, reaching a peak of 82.6g, which left him
unconscious, with no measurable blood pressure for 30 seconds.
Hospitalized for three days, Breeding made a full recovery).</P>

<P>Besides Stapp, there were a number of researchers in the United
States and abroad who risked their own lives to further aerospace
medicine. Using sealed gondolas, or open cabins and pressure suits,
high-altitude balloonists such as M. Lee Lewis, Malcolm Ross, Charles
Moore, David Simons, Clifton McClure, Joseph Kittinger, and Victor
Prather took huge polyethylene balloons to altitudes as high as
113,700 feet in the years from 1947 to 1961. These flights always
involved tremendous dangers, even near the surface, as the tragic
deaths of Lewis and Victor Prather showed (the former perishing in a
ground handling accident, and the latter falling and drowning during
a landing at sea). Many of these long-duration flights were to
validate the performance of aircrew in near-space environments, but
Kittinger, in 1959-1960, made three notable free-fall parachute
jumps, the last from 102,800 feet.</P>

<P>The courage and determination of these researcher-test subjects
cannot be overemphasized, and, thanks to them, both the prospects of
survival and the prospects of practical high-altitude, high-speed,
and, even, practical near-earth space flight were considerably
brightened. When <I>Project</I> <I>Mercury</I> took to space in 1962,
it did so on the firm basis of aeromedical work accomplished in
support of the earlier American rocket research aircraft program
(typified by the supersonic X-1 and Douglas D-558-2, and the
hypersonic X-15). Among many different areas of investigation, these
aircraft had explored the problems of control at high-altitudes. They
also furnished opportunities for evaluating crew performance during
zero g flying conditions, under conditions of abrupt acceleration
during rocket boost, and during high-workload powerless
low-lift-to-drag-ratio landings. Such vehicles had required
development of specialized aeromedical equipment (particularly
pressure suits such as the David Clark X-15 suit of 1959, the first
operational full-pressure suit, which anticipated later full-pressure
suits for the manned space program). "X-series" research flights were
themselves high risk missions, and not simply because of the
aerodynamic and propulsion unknowns associated with the dawn of
supersonic flight and early manned rocketry. For example, X-15 pilots
tended to experience vertigo during acceleration and climb to
altitude, and one of them, Michael Adams, was killed in an accident
where this tendency almost certainly played a significant role.</P>

<P>The American manned spacecraft program went surprisingly smoothly,
with the marked exception of the loss of the <I>Apollo</I> 1 test
crew in 1967 during a pre-launch spacecraft fire (due in large
measure to poor vehicle design that relied upon a pure oxygen
environment), the near-loss of <I>Apollo</I> 13 (whose crew survived
in part because of excellent aerospace medical technical support as
well as training); and the Space Shuttle <I>Challenger</I>. As tragic
as the latter was, the success of the space program to that time had
been remarkable, without the loss of an astronaut in flight over the
previous quarter-century. This success required challenging study,
training, and evaluation procedures, and widespread and comprehensive
laboratory and flight research.</P>

<P>Among the many unknowns and concerns affecting spaceflight at the
dawn of the so-called "Space Age" were human performance and mobility
in a weightless environment, nutritional and toxicological challenges
and requirements, circadian cycle issues, prolonged isolation,
protection from space radiation, and tolerance and performance during
reentry. Short of actual in-space experience, all of these required
creative means of research and assessment. For example, zero-g could
be briefly simulated by flying so-called "Keplerian trajectories" in
two-seat fighters such as the Lockheed F-94C Starfire and North
American F-100F Super Sabre, and modified transports such as
NASA&#146;s infamous Boeing KC-135 "Vomit Comet." In other cases, to
measure acceleration effects during launch, monkeys and other animals
were launched aboard research rockets and then recovered for study.
Test subjects, candidate astronauts, and X-15 pilots underwent
centrifuge studies (in one case, in 1975, during tests of inclined
seats, Navy volunteers withstood 14g for 45 seconds without loss of
consciousness or vision disturbance). Special
multiple-degree-of-freedom space motion simulators could disorient a
test subject, who then had to use his controls to try to regain
"control" of his "spacecraft." All of these proved useful, but no
substitute for actual inflight space experience.</P>

<P>From the earliest days of NASA, the agency incorporated a
biomedical study group as part of its manned spacecraft effort,
complementing the well-established military aerospace research
establishments then in existence, such as the Air Force&#146;s
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, or the Navy&#146;s Aviation
Medical Acceleration Laboratory. But exactly what conditions a
spacefarer might have to encounter were so difficult to predict and
assess, that, as an expedient, the physical standards for astronaut
selection processes were almost arbitrarily high and demanding. In
the most highly publicized result of these standards, <I>Mercury</I>
astronaut Donald K. "Deke" Slayton was removed from flight status
before he had his chance to fly in space, though he remained with the
space program and eventually, in an era where better understanding of
the physiological requirements of spaceflight existed, commanded the
international <I>Apollo</I>-<I>Soyuz Test Project</I> (<I>ASTP</I>)
in 1975, the famed "handshake in space" mission.</P>

<P>The nature of the space program gave a strong, structured focus to
American aerospace medical research and support requirements.
<I>Mercury</I> was essentially to orbit an astronaut and recover him
successfully. <I>Gemini</I> would use a two-man spacecraft to assess
team performance in space, and to accomplish early rendezvous and
docking tasks. <I>Apollo</I> would take a team of astronauts, deploy
two of them to land on the Moon, and then recover them and return to
earth. After <I>Apollo</I> was a not-then-very-well-defined notion
for some sort of space station with a logistical spacecraft (which
became the Shuttle) to support it. The downturn in the national space
program after <I>Apollo</I> suspended for well over a decade plans to
build a genuine space station in orbit. Skylab (a short-term orbital
research facility) and some of the longer Shuttle missions acquired
some useful data on long-duration research. But the most dramatic and
graphic data came from the extremely long duration Soviet missions,
including some, after the end of the Cold War, which involved visits
by American astronauts to the Soviet space station <I>Mir</I>.</P>

<P>Both American and Soviet shorter-duration missions indicated that
problems people had presumed to be serious--for example accelerations
and zero g, or blood pressure changes, or hallucinations and
euphoria--were either nonexistent or of less consequence than
thought. But longer duration missions by astronauts and cosmonauts
alike witnessed more serious difficulties. These ranged from personal
hygiene issues, to bickering, sulking, and other interpersonal
conflict between crewmen, to isolation and boredom, and, more
seriously still, unanticipated physiological problems typified by
reduced exercise capacity, bone demineralization, muscle atrophy, and
decreased red-cell mass. The image of returning cosmonauts lifted out
of their <I>Soyuz</I> spacecraft in the steppes of Central Asia,
placed in litters, and then whisked by helicopter to the nearest
hospital as anxious medical personnel watch over them is not one to
give much hope to enthusiasts wanting to fly to Mars.</P>

<P>Clearly in this century we have mastered manned flight within the
atmosphere and, to a great degree, in the environment of low and
medium earth orbit as well. The challenge over the next century will
be to expand our ability to exploit both mediums but, increasingly,
the space medium in particular. This is by no means easy. But then,
neither was the invention and exploitation of the airplane or,
perhaps more appropriately, the European colonization of the "New
World."</P>

<P>If we, in closing, briefly cast back to that earlier era, we see
some striking parallels to the century of flight that we have
experienced, and the century that lies before us. The very late
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries constituted an era of great
exploration and increasing mastery of the intercontinental seas. The
seventeenth century was the century of growing commercial and
military exploitation, culminating in the explosive industrial
revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth century that set the
stage for the technological revolution of this century as well.</P>

<P>Today, spaceflight is in the position that transoceanic voyages
were after Columbus: humanity then could only grasp the potential,
just as today spaceflight&#146;s potential is still primarily in the
future. As those early sea voyagers had to face considerable medical
challenges, such as nutrition and disease, so, too, do we have to
face considerable medical challenges as we contemplate extending our
ability to operate beyond the Earth-Moon environment and on into
interplanetary space. But if the history of flight in this century,
and particularly the history of aerospace medicine in this century,
has any lesson to teach us at all, it is that imagined barriers and
actual barriers alike are all-too-often vanquished by resolute
spirit, intelligence, and creativity. Those virtues have been innate
in the aerospace medical profession in this century, and will, I am
certain, carry us forward so that the first century of the next
millennium is one of even more extraordinary accomplishment. Thank
you all very much&#151;and congratulations!</P>
