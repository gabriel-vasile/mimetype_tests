ABSTRACT

Several thoracic and head protection side impact air bag systems (SAB) are emerging in the U.S. market and are projected to become prevalent in the fleet. These systems appear to offer improved protection in side crashes. However, concerns have been raised as to their potential for causing injury to out-of-position (OOP) occupants. This report describes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) research program for evaluation of the SAB systems for OOP occupants. The procedures recommended by the Side Airbag Out-of-Position Injury Technical Working Group (TWG), comprised of the Alliance, AIAM, AORC, and IIHS, for 3-year-old and 6-year-old occupants are evaluated. Additional test procedures are described to augment the TWG procedures.

1.0 INTRODUCTION:
Several thoracic and head protection side impact air bag systems (SAB) are emerging in the U.S. market and are projected to become prevalent in the fleet (Figure 1). The market share of SAB equipped vehicles in 2001 is estimated to be 36% for passenger cars and 15% for LTV/SUV. These inflatable side countermeasures vary widely in designs, sizes, mounting locations and methods, inflation systems, and areas of coverage. In particular, there are several seat and door mounted thorax air bag systems; various versions of a window curtain type head protection air bag system, an inflatable tubular structure head protection system, a combination head/thorax seat mounted air bag system, etc. These systems appear to offer improved protection in side crashes. NCAP tests on forty-five four door cars show that the eleven vehicles with SAB got higher star ratings (for the driver) than those without SAB. Also, the average TTI values (for the driver) of the SAB equipped vehicles were lower than for those without SAB. 

Figure 1. Use of Front Seat SAB in Vehicles

As of January 1, 2001, the NHTSA Special Crash Investigations (SCI) program had studied 48 crashes involving SAB [1]. In vehicles with head protection side air bags, the SAB provided an increase in occupant protection, indicated by a direct contact to the outside surface of the head protection air bag with no head injury reported. There were no serious injuries (AIS-3 or higher) attributed to SAB in the majority of the cases. In a single exception, the driver received anAIS-3 thorax injury from the SAB cover flap in a door mounted thorax SAB system. However, concerns have been raised as to their potential for causing injury to out-of-position (OOP) occupants, especially as the usage of SAB systems increases in the coming years.

The need to understand the benefits and potential for harm to OOP occupants (and certain in-position occupants, e.g., properly restrained infants in child restrained systems) is especially important considering the growth in the number of SAB systems in the past few years and the projected trend for the prevalence of such systems, standard or optional, in the coming years.

This report describes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) research program for evaluation of the SAB systems for OOP occupants. The procedures recommended by the Side Airbag Out-of-Position Injury Technical Working Group (TWG) , comprised of the Alliance, AIAM, Automotive Occupant Restraints Council (AORC), and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), for the 3-year-old and 6-year-old occupants were evaluated.

Additional test procedures are described to augment the TWG procedures. This includes assessments of in-position 12 month CRABI dummy in forward and rear facing child restraint systems, which are not addressed by the current TWG procedures. This report focuses on seat mounted and door mounted SAB systems for thorax and head protection. Additional research is ongoing into the evaluation of adult OOP dummies, roof mounted air bag systems, and repeatability of these test procedures.

2.0 BACKGROUND
The agency has been concerned about the potential for injury from side air bags, considering that front air bags have been the cause of injury and fatalities in certain low severity impacts. The agency initiated research in fall of 1998 into 3-year-old child OOP interactions with SAB [2]. The study concluded that some SAB systems had the potential for causing injury to the head-neck-chest of OOP children, although less aggressive airbags reduced that potential. The results were sensitive to the positioning of the dummy and had some test-to-test variability because of variability in the deployment characteristics of the bags.

Research was also initiated by Transport Canada in 1998 to examine the most appropriate and effective means of minimizing injury risks to children under “off-design” conditions [3]. The research concluded that while SAB have thepotential for benefit in side crashes, they also have the potential for causing injury to OOP children. The results from the 1998 NHTSA research and Transport Canada study were presented at a public meeting in April 1999 [4].

In December 1998, then NHTSA Administrator, Ricardo Martinez, M.D., wrote to the automobile manufacturers indicating that the SAB had significant safety potential, and encouraged the manufacturers to confirm that the current and projected applications of advanced technologies did not pose safety risks. The letter also indicated a willingness to work jointly with the industry to establish rigorous internal design protocols to address this possibility. In May 1999, Dr. Martinez, in a letter to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (Alliance) and Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM), asked the industry to develop comprehensive, open, and timely test procedures for the industry to follow, which would ensure that future side air bags would not pose any risk of serious injury to occupants [5].

In August 2000, the Side Airbag Out-of-Position Injury Technical Working Group (TWG) proposed test devices, performance criteria, and test procedures for assessing SAB deployment injury risks [6]. These proposals were based on a draft procedure [7] developed by the Working Group 3 of the International Organization of Standards Technical Committee 10. The TWG procedures provided a framework for the agency’s research activities described in this report.

In the summer of 1999, research was initiated at NHTSA’s Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) to study the potential for injury to OOP occupants and to evaluate the benefits of SAB in side impacts. The first phase of this research was to evaluate the TWG procedures and propose any additional procedures or modifications, if necessary, to assess the injury to OOP children and evaluate any risks to properly restrained children in child restraints and booster seats. The 2nd phase of that research is in progress. The findings from the first phase are presented in this report.

3.0 TEST CONDITIONS

3.1 Vehicle Selection:
The vehicles with seat, door, and roof mounted SAB (front seating position, unless specified otherwise) chosen for this study are shown in Table 1.

Specific models were chosen based on vehicle sales in the U.S. and the availability of the SAB in the vehicles. The initial selection of vehicles was done in the Spring of 1999. The goal was to have a range of airbags in the test matrix: head/thorax bags, thorax bags, head bags, seat mounted, door mounted, and roof mounted systems for a wide selection of vehicles with production side air bag systems. Although not prevalent, vehicles with side air bags in the rear seats were especially selected because of the need to evaluate the risks to children in the rear seat in child restraints.

Table 1. Vehicle Selection

3.2 Seating Procedures
The TWG OOP Seating Procedures [6] were used as the basis for selecting test positions. High speed videos of “blank deployments” (deployments of the air bags without any occupants in the seated positions) were studied to estimate any other position (for example, positions used in the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) study [2]) or variations to TWG positions that might result in high loads to the head and chest. The goal was to understand the location of the bag deployment opening, deployment path, bag size, etc. This was used as a guide for finding the positions for the most severe loads for dummies of various sizes.

A test matrix was set up based on the above study of 13 test vehicles. The vehicles had different types of side airbags; door mounted, seat mounted, and head bag curtains. The test matrix lists the different types of vehicles and the tests that were performed on either the front or the rear passenger seat. The objective of these tests was to evaluate the OOP performance of the side air bags for three-year-old and six-year-old, and the properly restrained 12-month-CRABI dummies. Some of the positions for booster seats (not covered by the TWG procedures) were evaluated with a small child occupant. Evaluation of roof mounted air bags is not included in this report.

3.2.1 Seat Mounted Systems
The following baseline tests were performed on most of the vehicles with the Hybrid III three-year-old dummy in vehicles with seat mounted systems: TWG 3.3.2.2 -peek-a-boo (kneeling on the seat, facing rearwards), TWG 3.3.2.1 -leaning sideways with booster, and TWG 3.3.2.3 -lying across the seat with head on armrest. If the review of the high speed films indicated an alternative seating position that would more likely produce higher loads, then additional tests were conducted in positions derived from varying the TWG positions.

The following seating procedure variations were tested on several vehicles: peek-a-boo with arm out of the way and the side touching armrest, on foam booster leaning sideways with pelvis forward until head touches seatback, leaning sideways without a foam booster, lying across seat at an angle with head on armrest, properly seated in a belt positioning booster (BPB), on a BPB leaning sideways, the Medical College of Wisconsin Procedure (MCW)-where the dummy is seated in the center of the seat and leaning sideways[2], and MCW position on a booster. The BPB used in all tests was the Fisher Price Booster Model # 79750.

Variations to TWG positions were also tested for the 6-year-old Hybrid III dummy. The baseline test performed for most of the vehicles was TWG 3.3.2.5 -leaning sideways on booster. The following modified seating procedures were performed: leaning sideways without a booster, leaning sideways with the head CG at the horizontal center of the airbag module, leaning sideways at the seat’s centerline with the pelvis forward and head CG in line with the top of the airbag module, and MCW.

The 12-month-CRABI dummy was tested in two different types of child restraints: a forward facing child restraint system (FFCRS) with tray shield and a rearward facing child safety seat (RFCSS). The two child seats used were Century Ovation Model # 4665NSK and Fisher Price Safe Embrace Infant Seat Model # 79725, respectively. The child seats were installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (using lap-shoulder belts, without tethers) and were checked for cracks and/or any other damage noted after each test.

Table 2 contains a summary of all the seating positions used for the seat mounted systems. Appendix A contains a detailed description of the procedures followed for each of the NHTSA positions.

3.2.2 Door Mounted Systems
The following baseline TWG tests were performed with the Hybrid III 3-year-old dummy in vehicles with door mounted systems: TWG 3.3.3.1 -kneeling at window, TWG 3.3.3.2 -back on door facing inward, and TWG 3.3.3.3 -head on armrest. The following modified seating procedures were tested on several vehicles: kneeling at window -knees at the door, back on door -lower neck to upper airbag module, dummy’s head CG at vertical centerline of airbag module (MCW), sitting at seat centerline with seat at rearmost position leaning sideways with head CG at airbag module, sitting at seat centerline leaning sideways with head CG at horizontal centerline of airbag module, sitting in a BPB, and sitting in a BPB leaning sideways.

Table 2. Test Positions for Seat Mounted Air Bags

Table 3. Test Positions for Door Mounted Air Bags

There were no TWG tests with the Hybrid III 6-year-old dummy used as baseline tests for the door mounted systems. The following tests were performed for door mounted systems: back on door -lower neck to upper airbag module, dummy’s head CG at vertical centerline of airbag module (MCW), sitting at seat centerline leaning sideways with head CG at airbag module, sitting at seat centerline leaning sideways with head CG at horizontal centerline of airbag module, and sitting at seat centerline leaning sideways with top of head at horizontal centerline of the airbag module.

The door mounted systems were tested with the 12-month CRABI dummy using the same child seats and positioning procedures as in the seat mounted systems.

Table 3 contains a summary of all seating positions used for the door mounted systems. Appendix A contains a detailed description of the procedures followed for each of the NHTSA positions.

3.3 Dummies and Instrumentation
The Hybrid III 3-year-old dummy used in the testing had the following instrumentation: head tri-axial accelerometers, upper and lower 6-axis neck load cells, left and right biaxial shoulder load cells, T01 tri-axial accelerometers, T12 tri-axial accelerometers, chest tri-axial accelerometers, chest displacement potentiometer, rib #3 uni-axial accelerometer, upper and lower sternum uni-axial accelerometers, 6-axis lumbar load cell, pelvis tri-axial accelerometers, biaxial pubic load cell, and right and left upper and lower biaxial ASIS load cells.

The Hybrid III 6-year-old dummy had the following instrumentation: head tri-axial accelerometers, upper and lower 6-axis neck load cells, chest tri-axial accelerometers, chest displacement potentiometer, upper and lower spine uni-axial accelerometers, upper and lower sternum uni-axial accelerometers, pelvis tri-axial accelerometers, and right and left upper and lower biaxial ASIS load cells.

The 12-month-CRABI dummy had the following instrumentation: head triaxial accelerometers, upper and lower 6-axis neck load cells, chest triaxial accelerometers, 6-axis lumbar load cell, and pelvis triaxial accelerometers.

The body coordinate system used for the dummies was per SAE J211 (March 1995), including the accelerometers (X-Forward; Y-Rightward and Z-Down).

The dummy positions were documented by taking several measurements from the dummy to the interior parts of the vehicle (tip of dummy’s nose to corner of glove box, head CG to side air bag center, lower neck junction to top of seat air bag, head CG to head restraint). All tests were documented with digital still photography and two high speed digital videos at 1000 frames per second.

3.4 Injury Criteria
TWG has recommended two sets of injury criteria: Injury Reference Values and Injury Research Values.
A thorough evaluation of the validity of TWG recommended injury criteria, and the corresponding threshold values, was not included in this program. However, to compare the relative safety performance of the dummies in various positions considered in this report, those injury reference and research values were used, with the exception of the injury criteria for the 3-year-old chest deflection and 6-year-old HIC. The injury threshold values for these two criteria were per NHTSA interim final rule for FMVSS 208, published in May 2000.

The injury reference value and the research value thresholds used in this report are listed in Table 4.

Table 4.
Injury Reference and Research Value Thresholds

For this study, the chest deflection rate was calculated by differentiating the chest potentiometer.

4.0 TEST RESULTS
The test matrices for the OOP tests are shown in Tables 5 through 13. The test numbers are denoted in the appropriate cells. The tests that exceeded the injury reference value thresholds are marked with ** while those that exceeded 80% of the injury reference value thresholds are marked with *. Similarly, the tests that exceeded the research value thresholds are marked with ^^ and those that exceeded 80% of the research value thresholds are marked by ^.
The untested combinations were considered unlikely to cause high loads on the dummies based on the dummy positions and the bag deployment characteristics (as determined by the blank deployments).
For some of the tests which produced high injury values, a repeat test was conducted. If the results of the repeat test did not closely match those of the first test, a second repeat test was performed. No repeat tests were done with the 12-month CRABI, since the injury values were very low.
A summary of the injury criteria measurements for all tests is contained in Appendix B. Details of the tests conducted with the Hybrid-III 3YO and 6YO and with the 12 month CRABI are contained in Appendices C, D, and E, respectively.

5.0 OBSERVATIONS

5.1 Seat mounted Systems
For the seat mounted air bag systems, the dummy’s loads were affected by the seat bolsters, airbag module locations, and the type of the airbag (i.e., thorax or head/thorax bag).

The TWG 3.3.2.2 procedure, where the Hybrid III 3-year-old was facing rearward in the seat and the chest (upper rib) was aligned with the top of the airbag module, provided a good procedure for measuring injuries to the chest of 3-year-old occupants. Figure 2 shows some of the vehicles with high chest deflection and chest deflection rates produced by this position. However, in some cases, this alignment couldn’t be obtained, because the top of the airbag module was too high in the seat (00 Nissan Maxima, 99 Ford Windstar). In these particular cases, the dummy was positioned as close as possible to the desired TWG position.

TWG 3.3.2.1 (leaning sideways on a booster) was an effective procedure for measuring the loads on the head-neck region of the 3 –year-old on the vehicles where the TWG position allowed the head to touch the seatback. However, in the 1999 Ford Windstar (Figure 3) and the 1999 Mercury Cougar, when seated per TWG 3.3.2.1, the dummy’s head did not touch the seatback. These vehicles have large seat bolsters, causing the dummy to sit farther away. NHTSA developed seating procedures NHTSA-Seat-07-3 (Figure 4), NHTSA-Seat-02-3 (Figure 5) and NHTSA-Seat-08-3 (Figure 6) to put the head in closer proximity to the air bag. These involved sliding the pelvis forward and aligning some portion of the dummy’s head to be near the top or middle of the airbag module, or had the dummy sitting in the center of the seat (instead of at the edge), leaning sideways, with its head CG at the center of the airbag module. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the higher loads produced by NHTSA-Seat-02-3 and NHTSA-Seat-07-3 compared to those produced by TWG 3.3.2.1.

The seat mounted air bags can be located at different heights along the seat back. Adding NHTSA-Seat-03-3 to NHTSA-Seat-02-3, NHTSA-Seat-07-3, NHTSA-Seat-08-3 and the TWG positions, provides the ability to locate the head of the 3-year-old leaning sideways at a range of vertical locations along the seat back (Figure 9). This helps in identifying test conditions which produce more severe loads.

Two vehicles (Volvo S80 and Geo Prizm) passed all TWG position tests but exceeded the neck twist (MZ) criteria in NHTSA-Seat-10-3 (upper neck) and NHTSA-Seat-03-3 (lower neck) positions, respectively (Figure 10).

The above result, and the substantial differences in some of the dummy responses (Figures 7 and 8) indicate that there is some potential for one of the NHTSA procedures to detect an aggressive air bag not identified by the TWG procedures alone.

Figure 10. Vehicles Passing TWG and Failing a NHTSA Position

Certain TWG positions were not considered likely to produce any significant loads on the dummies for the vehicles considered in this study. For example, TWG 3.3.2.4 and 3.3.3.4 (lying on the seat, seat and door mounted systems) were not tested, based on the study of blank deployments for the selected vehicles.

5.2 Door Mounted Systems:
All of the door mounted TWG procedures were evaluated, except for TWG 3.3.3.4 (lying across the seat with the head resting on the seat cushion). Based on the blank deployments with the three different vehicles (with two vehicles having rear door mounted systems), it was determined that the airbag would produce very low loads on the dummy or not contact the dummy.

TWG 3.3.3.1 (Hybrid III 3-year-old kneeling at the door with its head facing out the window) produced high chest deflections in some tests.

The TWG 3.3.3.2 position (the dummy facing inward with its back against the door aligned the upper neck to the upper airbag module) produced high upper neck tension force (+FZ) and high research injury numbers in the lower neck tension force (+FZ)

A more severe test for the Hybrid III 3-year-old was TWG 3.3.3.3 (head on armrest). This position put the top of the dummy’s head in the opening where the airbag deployed. This was severe for all vehicles, both front and rear. The dummy’s neck was forced downward as the flap folded down and the airbag deployed. This caused high loads in head, upper neck, and lower neck. Figure 11 shows the normalized injury values produced by this position for all vehicles, in front and rear seating positions.

TWG did not recommend any positions for door mounted systems with the dummy leaning sideways (while facing forward). NHTSA evaluated some leaning sideways positions, putting the dummy’s head CG in different locations on the airbag module. There were several tests with high injury numbers. Figure 12 shows the neck loads produced by one such position with the 3 YO dummy.

TWG did not have any positions for the Hybrid III 6-year-old for door mounted systems. NHTSA Door-01-6 position, where the lower neck is aligned with the upper airbag module was evaluated. The injury numbers were generally low, with some tests producing high values of MY and MZ (neck twist moment) as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13. High Injury Values in NHTSA-DOOR-01-06


5.3 General Observations:
TWG procedures are generally capable of discriminating air bag systems over a wide variety of systems. The TWG and NHTSA procedures indicate that high loads are possible in SAB systems, especially from door mounted bags and seat mounted head-thorax combination bags. For example, seven out of twelve vehicles (with door or seat mounted bags) exceeded injury reference values in OOP tests.

For the 3YO dummy, 8 of 10 seat mounted bags and all door mounted bags exceeded injury reference or research values. For the 6YO dummy, 6 of 10 seat mounted bags and 3 of 5 door mounted bags exceeded injury reference or research values.

Tests with in-position, properly restrained occupants in forward and rear facing child restraints did not produce high loads. However, a test (A01_62) of a door-mounted SAB with a 3 YO dummy in the rear seat, restrained in a belt positioning booster, but OOP (leaning towards the door) produced high HIC values.

Considerable resources (time and money) were spent in locating the correct replacement parts for the side air bag systems (module, mounting hardware, etc.). It is of some concern that often the dealerships were unable to identify or supply the correct parts for these late model vehicles. It is hoped that such confusion will not result in incorrect parts getting used to repair vehicles on the road.

6.0 SUMMARY
*TWG procedures are generally capable of discriminating air bag systems over a wide variety of systems.
*Certain TWG positions may not be attainable in some vehicles. This would indicate that a set of generic positions may not be suitable for all vehicles. Variations based on SAB location, deployment path, and bag size and shape may be necessary.
*Certain TWG positions are not expected to produce any significant loads on the dummies in the vehicles included in this study.
*Several vehicles exceeded injury thresholds with the NHTSA procedures but did not with the TWG procedures.
*Some additional positions increase the likelihood of identifying air bags which may produce more severe, and potentially injurious, loads on OOP occupants:
o NHTSA Seat-02-3 and NHTSA Seat-07-3 : locates the head CG closer to the air bag
o NHTSA Door-04-3 and NHTSA Door-06-3 : adds leaning sideways condition for 3 YO in door mounted systems (not included in TWG procedures)
o NHTSA Seat-04-6 and NHTSA Seat-05-6 : adds leaning sideways condition for 6 YO in door mounted systems (not included in TWG procedures)
o NHTSA Door-01-6 : adds back against the door condition for 6 YO in door mounted systems (not included in TWG procedures)
*Tests with in-position, properly restrained occupants in forward and rear facing child restraints did not produce high loads.
*High loads are possible in out of position children in belt positioning boosters in vehicles with door mounted bags, even in the rear seat.
*Considerable efforts were spent in locating the correct replacement parts for the side air bag systems (module, mounting hardware, etc.).

APPENDIX A
NHTSA’s Side Air Bag Out-of-Position Static Deployment Tests Seating Procedures Used in Addition to the TWG Procedures


NHTSA’s side air bag evaluation program evaluated the performance of side air bags in out-of-position situations. The test positions suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG) were used as baseline test conditions. Additional positions, described below, were also tested to evaluate the TWG positions and to achieve the worst case condition (produce higher loads) for the OOP dummies.

The seating procedures described on the following pages are general guidelines. These procedures were developed on some of the vehicles selected for the NHTSA study. The procedures, as written, have not been tested to work in other vehicles.

The following are the first steps in all of the modified seating procedures, unless otherwise stated in the procedure. These are based on the TWG’s general guidelines.

1. Place the seat in the rearmost position and the lowest adjustment, unless otherwise specified.
2. Position the seatback at a torso angle of 25 degrees, as measured on the SAE J826 H-Point machine.
3. Mark the airbag module’s top and bottom on the seat or door, for easy reference.
4. Mark the seat centerline, for easy reference.
5. Mark the location of the head CG at the sides of the dummy head.
6. Mark the seat for heel placements at two points; 75 mm from the centerline on each side and 20 to 50 mm from the leading edge of the seat.
7. Adjust the head restraint to its full-down position, or remove if interfering.
8. Place the safety belt anchor in its highest position.
9. Position the window either up or down. Most of the tests performed were with the window down, for easier access to the dummy for positioning and better lighting for high speed photography.
10. The foam block booster, used in some of the procedures, should be of the following dimensions: 300 mm deep by 450 mm wide by 75 mm thick. The foam has a density of 40-80 g/l. A typical foam material is expanded polypropylene (EPP).
11. The wedge-shaped foam block, used in some of the procedures, should be the same density as the foam block booster and wide enough to support the dummy’s back.

Seat Mounted Side Airbag Seating Procedures For a Hybrid III 3-year old



NHTSA Seat-01-3:
*Place the dummy along the outboard edge of the seat cushion kneeling and facing rearward. Its feet may overhang the front edge of the seat cushion.
*Align the dummy’s sternum as close as possible with the leading edge of the seatback bolster or forward most contour line. The sternum should contact the seat.
*Place the dummy’s head between the seatback and B-pillar. The head should remain in its neutral orientation and should not be forced into flexion or extension. For rear seats tests, the head should be placed as far outboard as possible.
*Position the outboard leg at the outboard edge of the seat cushion and parallel to the seat centerline. For seat cushions with bolsters, the outboard leg should be placed as close to the edge of the seat cushion as possible, while remaining on the cushion.
*Move the outboard arm up and away from the side of the dummy, slide the dummy toward the door and/or armrest so that it is touching. Try to keep the dummy in the same vertical alignment.
*Slide the outboard knee and lower leg toward the seat bight (seatback/seat cushion junction) until the top edge of the upper rib is aligned horizontally with the top edge of the airbag module. The sternum should be in contact with the leading edge of the seatback bolster.
