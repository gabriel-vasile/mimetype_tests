Helene Braver Recognized for 16 Years of Service to Marylanders</center></i><p>
<p><b>WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Barbara A. Mikulski </b>(D-MD) today congratulated Helene Braver on 16 years of dedicated service to Maryland's citizens.  Helene is a Federal Employees caseworker in the Senator's Baltimore Office.<p>
<p>	Mrs. Braver moved to the Baltimore area 19 years ago with her late husband, and began working for Senator Mikulski when she was a member of the House of Representatives.  As a caseworker in the northwest Baltimore office, her casework included immigration, Worker's Compensation, and Social Security benefits.<p>
<p>	"Helene Braver has always been an integral part of my staff," said Senator Mikulski.  "I can count on her to get the job done and be an advocate for Marylanders.  Whether it's helping families get green cards for their relatives or cutting the red tape for older people waiting for their Social Security checks, Helene exemplifies one of my own guiding principles – we cannot always guarantee an outcome, but we can guarantee a first-class effort."<p>
<p>	In her years with Senator Mikulski, Mrs. Braver remembers case after case where she and the Senator have helped Marylanders with their day to day needs.  One case stands out in her mind-- when she and the Senator helped an orphan from Rwanda get a visa to come to the United States to live with her American relatives after her parents had been killed.<p>
<p>	"It's always been a labor of love for me," said Mrs. Braver.  "Helping people when they need it most has been the most rewarding part of my career."<p>
<p>	Senator Mikulski proudly salutes Helene Braver for 16 years of dedicated service.<p>
