<P>
<FONT>As one of several working groups charged with the ultimate task of
promoting research on fathers, we recognize that scholarly and social policy
initiatives are linked to decisions about how fatherhood is defined. Our
conceptual treatment of fatherhood focuses on both the social and legal
definition of "father," (Marsiglio, forthcoming) and the cognitive, affective,
and behavioral aspects of male parenting as an ongoing interpersonal process
(Palkovitz, 1997). Addressing these complex and interrelated conceptual issues
is essential if researchers and policymakers are to improve the quality of
data and research on fathers (Fox and Bruce, 1996). Simply put, the research
community must attend to these issues if we are to develop a better understanding
of fathers' involvement<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP> with, and
influence on, their
children.<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Fatherhood, and its many aspects, can be conceptualized in diverse
ways. Numerous questions frame the sometimes controversial and often perplexing
issues that need to be explored in this regard. Some of these include the
following:</FONT>

  <LI>
    <FONT>How should fatherhood be defined? What is the basis for advocating
    one definition over another? In short, who are fathers?</FONT>

</OL>
<P>
<FONT>Defining fatherhood in the United States is a difficult task, in part,
because many factors shape the way fathers are perceived and behave. These
difficulties are accentuated by the varied disciplinary and theoretical
perspectives that are brought to bear on this task. We attempt to capture
some of this complexity in our interdisciplinary report. In addition, we
show how four general interrelated themes or foci enrich our definition of
social fatherhood and paternal involvement. These themes include: a) family
structure, b) cultural diversity, c) the notion that aspects of parenting
are fundamentally shaped by dynamic and gendered social roles, and d) the
idea that developmental trajectories, expressed at various points throughout
the life course, influence fathers' involvement with their children.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Framework</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>In this interdisciplinary report, we address the compelling questions
noted above and propose a framework for conceptualizing "social fatherhood"
that focuses on key aspects of male parenting. We use the term "social
fatherhood" throughout this report to underscore the wide net we cast when
we address fatherhood issues. Thus, we are not merely interested in men who
are biological progenitors, although they clearly represent the most important
group of men we consider (we exclude men who are anonymous sperm donors).
For our purposes, being a social father includes many dimensions. It includes,
for example, the range of activities outlined by Palkovitz (1997) that expand
upon earlier conceptualizations of paternal involvement (Lamb, Pleck, Charnov,
and Levine, 1987). This more comprehensive vision of paternal involvement
is consistent with our objective of developing a framework that captures
the diverse ways fathers help to raise their children and influence their
well-being. We underscore the notion that fathers' contributions often go
beyond their hands-on care of children. As such, we take into account the
resources fathers can provide for their children including human capital
(e.g., skills, knowledge, and traits that foster achievement in U.S. society),
financial capital (e.g., money, goods, and experiences purchased with income),
and social capital (e.g., family and community relations that benefit children's
cognitive and social development) (Amato, 1998; see also Coleman, 1988, 1990;
Hagan, MacMillan, and Wheaton, 1996). Of these resources, we focus primarily
on aspects of fathers' economic provider roles and their contribution of
social capital as expressed through coparental and father-child
relationships.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Four interrelated issues.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>We present our
framework as the basis for collecting more meaningful data on fathers in
order to generate theoretically informed research and policymaking agendas
that address issues associated with fathers' involvement with their children
and their contributions to their well-being. As such, we take a practical
approach to conceptualizing and reviewing literature that addresses four
interrelated issues associated with social fatherhood and paternal involvement
(including the various forms of capital described above). First, we discuss
issues associated with the conceptualization and assessment of <I>fathers'
involvement</I>. We highlight the range of activities and dimensions related
to fathers' roles, with particular attention to the way fathers spend time
with their children and fathers' economic provider roles. Second, we examine
some of the factors that underlie men's personal <I>motivation</I> to express
themselves as social and "responsible" fathers. Third, we emphasize how paternal
involvement is often shaped by the complex web of relationships between fathers,
their children, and children's mothers. We use the shorthand phrase "<I>family
process</I>" to refer to this set of relationships and the interpersonal
exchanges they entail. Within this domain, social capital associated with
a healthy coparental relationship provides children with the opportunity
to model dyadic skills such as providing emotional support, establishing
open communication, and implementing effective conflict resolution strategies.
It also exposes them to a united authority structure (Amato, 1998). Fourth,
we highlight some of the key <I>social policy</I> issues germane to fathers.
This discussion considers the structural barriers/facilitators that either
constrain or enhance a fathers' ability to assume active and responsible
roles in their children's lives, and, in some ways, is linked to our comments
about paternal involvement, motivation, and family process issues.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Based on previous reviews of the literature, we assume that a fathers'
positive involvement and resource provision can enhance children's well-being
(Lamb, 1997; Amato, 1998). Consequently, we assume that a fathers' negative
involvement and inability or unwillingness to provide certain types of resources
to their children can hinder children's healthy development. Our discussion
of social fatherhood and paternal involvement emphasizes the positive ways
fathers can influence their children's lives, though our discussion clearly
has implications for the adverse effects that children may experience when
their fathers exploit, neglect, or are unsuccessful in contributing to their
children's development.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Definitional Issues and Rationales</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Researchers, policymakers, and the general public continue to grapple
with the definition of "father." Not surprisingly, this question is addressed
from a wide range of disciplinary and ideological perspectives (Marsiglio,
1995a, forthcoming; Blankenhorn, 1995; Gershenson, 1983; Popenoe, 1996).
Consequently, much of the debate hinges on the legal/policy, genetic, and
social distinctions interested observers and stakeholders emphasize. These
distinctions are justified in terms of moral, pragmatic, and theoretical
rationales. The most typical response points to biological paternity as the
defining characteristic of fatherhood, but this approach has increasingly
been challenged by scholars and the general public alike for being overly
restrictive, and in some cases too
simplistic.<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP> For many, the more
intuitively appealing answer is: It depends. A man may be a father in the
eyes of geneticists and the law but not in those of a child; or the reverse
may be true. The distinction between the genetic father and the social father
has been reinforced because high rates of both out-of-wedlock childbearing
and divorce involving children have led to more men assuming father-like
roles with children who were not their biological offspring (Da Vanzo and
Rathman, 1993). The increasingly large percentage of men who have voluntarily
or reluctantly disengaged themselves from their nonresident children's lives
also contributes to this pattern (Furstenberg, 1988; 1995). Likewise, the
emerging appreciation for the cultural diversity in familial arrangements
highlights nontraditional definitions of fatherhood (Gershenson, 1983). These
ongoing debates about the definition of fatherhood have grown even more
complicated with the advent of asexual reproductive technologies which have
muddled traditional notions of paternity and fatherhood roles (Marsiglio,
forthcoming).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>A man may be genetically related to a child but have no social or legal
ties to his genetic offspring, or a man may have no genetic bond with a child
but be perceived by individuals and the legal system to have social, and
in some cases legal ties to the child. This latter scenario includes many
of the millions of men who assume formal or informal step and adoptive father
roles. In sum, the definition of fatherhood varies according to the personal
and cultural reference points being used.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Obviously, then, the definition of fatherhood is shaped simultaneously
by scholarly, political, and cultural forces. Thus, sober discussions about
the nuances of fatherhood definitions are essential if we are to develop
better research designs and social policies targeted at fathers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We propose a broad conceptual framework that goes beyond defining
fatherhood <U>a priori</U> along biological lines. Instead, we focus on the
more general concept of social fatherhood. In many respects biological fathers
will remain at the forefront of research and policymaking efforts, but these
efforts should not thwart attempts to study and support forms of male parenting
that involve men who are not genetically related to "their" children. A more
inclusive approach such as ours provides researchers and policymakers with
greater latitude in understanding the full range of issues involving men's
negotiation and expression of fathering roles (Fox and Bruce, 1996). It also
provides scholars with a clear incentive to explore the symbolic and practical
significance of biological paternity versus men's purely social ties to children,
as well as the legal implications associated with these distinctions.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Social father.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>As such, we justify focusing
on social fatherhood by pointing to both theoretical and pragmatic rationales.
From a theoretical point of view, much can be gained by studying the dynamic
processes that shape individuals' (e.g., fathers, mothers, children) perceptions
about how their sense of fatherhood personally affects
them.<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP> Biological paternity is clearly
not always perceived as the only defining characteristic of who fathers are
in contemporary society (Furstenberg, 1995; Gershenson, 1983; Marsiglio,
forthcoming). In some cases it may be completely irrelevant (e.g., sperm
donors). Furthermore, there are consequences associated with how people define
a situation -- whether that definition is consistent or not with commonly
recognized objective criteria (e.g., blood or legal ties). Put differently,
if individuals define situations as real, they are likely to have discernable
consequences for fathers, mothers, and children. Our conceptualization of
fatherhood, by emphasizing the social dimensions to fatherhood, takes these
issues into account.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We also emphasize the need to view men holistically as procreative
beings (Marsiglio, forthcoming). We stress the importance of recognizing
the continuity of men's roles beginning with their procreative decision-making
choices prior to conception, moving on to the pregnancy process
itself,<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP> and culminating in fathers'
involvement with their children. Unfortunately, little research has explored
prospective fathers' feelings and behaviors prior to the birth of their children
(May, 1980; May and Perrin,
1985).<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP> Because of the limited scholarship
in this area and the mission of our working group, we primarily focus on
issues directly related to fathers' involvement with their children. Nonetheless,
men's pre-birth experiences need to be addressed more systematically by future
researchers because some men have the opportunity to affect child outcomes
during this period as well as develop their sense of commitment to particular
father roles.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Generative fathering.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>From a practical point
of view, our conceptualization is appealing because it encourages policies
that reward men's positive and active participation in children's lives.
Our approach is consistent with a growing scholarly movement to define fathering
in terms of proactive behavior rather than from a `deficit model' (Hawkins
and Dollahite, 1997; Palkovitz, 1997; Snarey, 1993). From this <I>generative
fathering</I> perspective, researchers can avoid the temptation of looking
at father influence as a phenomena characterized by a father's absence. The
concept of generativity views fathering as a complex and emergent process
that accentuates men's personal growth vis-a-vis the child's well-being.
Understanding the reciprocal nature of interaction between parent and child
is the key; as both extend and invest in the relationship, both are enriched.
The deficit model suggests, on the other hand, that only the child suffers
when fathers are absent and that this absence is rather bi-modal (ie., the
father is either there or not).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Responsible fathering.</I></B> Our general definition of
"responsible" fatherhood, which is closely linked to generative fathering,
acknowledges the need to discuss motivational factors associated with men's
desire to be "responsible" fathers as well as their actual paternal involvement.
Our conceptualization is therefore consistent with Levine and Pitt's (1995,
p. 5-6) description of a "responsible man" as someone who does the
following:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>1. He waits to make a baby until he is prepared emotionally and financially
to support his child.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>2. He establishes his legal paternity if and when he does make a
baby.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>3. He actively shares with the child's mother in the continuing emotional
and physical care of their child, from pregnancy onwards [or is willing to
assume these responsibilities on his own if the mother does not wish to be
involved].</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>4. He shares with the child's mother in the continuing financial support
of their child, from pregnancy onwards [or is willing to assume these
responsibilities on his own if the mother does not wish to be involved].</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Our General Thematic Framework</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Fathers' attitudes and actions are affected by many factors including
their immediate social surroundings. In this regard, family structure variables
and residential arrangements are quite important. The growing diversity of
life course and residency patterns for men and children have fostered new
perceptions about fathers' roles (Gerson, 1993; Griswold, 1993; Marsiglio,
1995b). One consequence of these patterns is that, compared to a few decades
ago, a decreasing proportion of all children today live in households with
their biological fathers, and in no time in U.S. history have so many children
had biological fathers living elsewhere (Bianchi, 1995; Mintz, 1998). Moreover,
many children have stepfather figures living with them on a regular or irregular
basis, and growing numbers of men are assuming the role of custodial single
father (Brown, 1996; Eggebeen, Snyder, and Manning, 1996; Larson, 1992;
Marsiglio, 1995c). These patterns translate into expanding images of who
fathers are and what they do.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Family structure.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>These socio-demographic
patterns complicate researchers' efforts to understand divorced fathers'
commitment to and involvement with their nonresident biological children.
Researchers may need to consider whether stepfather figures alter biological
fathers' relationships with these children. Similarly, social fatherhood
issues are relevant to never married fathers' relationships with their young,
nonresident biological children if former partners mediate their chances
for being involved in their children's lives.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Diversity.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Our approach highlights how
sub-cultural diversity issues are relevant to both definitions of fatherhood
and men's experiences with expressing themselves as fathers. We briefly discuss
the interrelated factors associated with race and social class. Many of the
insights we have gleaned from the research in this area remind us that father
roles are quite diverse within the U.S., and that they frequently involve
negotiated arrangements between various family members, and in some cases
other individuals or groups. This research also highlights how these negotiations
occur within a larger ecological context that is fundamentally shaped by
economic and culturally based factors (Burton and Synder, 1996, Daly, 1995;
Furstenberg, 1995; Sullivan, 1989).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Gender.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Gender issues significantly affect
the way many men experience their everyday lives as procreative beings
(Marsiglio, forthcoming) and fathers (Coltrane, 1996). These issues influence
how men think about the prospects of paternity and fatherhood, how men view
themselves as fathers, the way men are viewed and treated as fathers, and
how fathers perceive their children and are involved in and/or affect their
lives. As a fundamental organizing principle of social life, gender influences
fathers' lives in numerous ways. For example, it is implicated in the way
institutional arrangements are structured (e.g., labor markets, corporate
culture, judicial system). In addition, when gender is viewed as a performed
activity that is constructed in specific interaction settings (West and
Zimmerman, 1987; Thompson, 1993), it provides individuals with opportunities
to display and interpret symbolic images of masculinity and femininity that
are closely tied to value laden meanings associated with the economic provider
and caretaker roles. Moreover, the process of "doing gender" underlies patterns
of interpersonal communication (e.g., negotiations about child care). In
short, many men and women experience tremendous anxiety and conflict sharing
parental responsibilities, due in part to their gendered expectations and
competing perceptions of family life (Fox and Bruce, 1996, see also Hawkins,
Christiansen, Sargent, and Hill, 1993).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>From a macro perspective, conservative and liberal social commentators
have each lamented cultural changes in how adulthood masculinity is defined
(Blankenhorn, 1995; Ehrenheich, 1983). The basic thrust of these arguments
is that cultural and social changes have weakened the connection between
masculinity norms and expectations about being a good "family man." Accordingly,
adult men have in recent years been able to pursue their individual interests
more easily as single men without jeopardizing their sense of
masculinity.<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP> In other words, they
are able to sustain their masculine sense of self without being a married
family man. Some observers believe that men's expanded options for achieving
adulthood masculinity have led to negative outcomes for many women and children
(Blankenhorn, 1995; Popenoe, 1996).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The gender theme is also intimately related to cultural diversity issues.
Masculinity norms and images, and the way these cultural elements are associated
with marriage and family life, may differ between men from different racial,
social class, and religious backgrounds. Determining how men in different
types of settings are able to express their manhood, and the importance they
place on doing so, is an important aspect to understanding fathers' level
and type of commitment to and involvement with their children.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Developmental/life course trajectories</I>. </FONT></B><FONT>It
is generally assumed (Klein and White, 1997) that developmental/life course
trajectories are inevitable. As time passes, the complexities of family
structure, issues in gender, and larger community/cultural norms about behavior
merge together to describe a person's and/or family's journey as their roles
and responsibilities change over time. The essence of this perspective is
that life is not static nor is it defined by simplistic role definitions
that can only capture a father's (for example) involvement level at one time
point, when he and his spouse/partner are at certain ages and the children
are at a particular stage of life. Further, this perspective also encourages
us to examine a family life form using multiple levels of analysis. That
is, we need to recognize that families are a type of social group but that
within that group are potential dyadic interactions, and further, the dyads
are made up of individuals who are passing through a life course. Therefore,
the description of family life is one of <I>aggregate </I>clusters of families,
communities and individuals. We further assume that all of these levels of
analysis have a significant impact on which of life's strategies to
choose.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Father Involvement: Assessment and Measurement</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>By employing a broad definition of father involvement, as we do, three
features are particularly striking. First, fathers can be involved with their
children in many ways. Palkovitz (1997), for example, identifies fifteen
general types of paternal involvement (e.g., doing errands, planning, providing,
shared activities, teaching, and thought processes, see Figure 1 for a complete
list). Second, there is a diverse array of potentially overlapping dimensions
or aspects associated with the numerous ways fathers are either involved
with their children and/or make contributions to their well-being (Amato,
1998; Hanson and Bozett, 1987; Fox and Bruce, 1996; Palkovitz, 1997; Lamb,
Pleck, Charnov, and Levine, 1987). Third, there are vast individual and
sub-cultural differences in how persons define and invest in these dimensions.
By contrast, because the core features of mothering (nurturance and protection)
are more universally recognized, much greater consensus exists about "good
mothers" than about "good fathers." Men committed to being "good fathers"
may perform in vastly different ways, with the same performances sometimes
being viewed as successful or unsuccessful depending on the implicit definitions
held by those making the evaluations. These facts confound efforts to examine
fathers' involvement and to articulate the motivations related to it. Ideally,
we are interested in determining the factors that lead to positive ways fathers
are involved with their children (Pleck, 1997).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Domains of paternal involvement</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Efforts
to develop a theoretically meaningful and tidy categorization scheme for
the varied forms of paternal involvement is fraught with difficulties. Fathers'
assorted forms of involvement can be grouped together in various ways. The
most rudimentary approach reveals that men's experiences as fathers can be
categorized within one of three overlapping domains of functioning: cognitive,
affective, and behavioral (Palkovitz, 1997; Doherty, 1997; Hawkins and Palkovitz,
1997). In other words, when we think about what fathers do with and for their
children, we are able to place them within one of these three domains. What
becomes apparent is that any behavioral expression that can be described
as paternal involvement also contains cognitive and affective components.
To date, however, researchers have concentrated on measuring and studying
fathers' behaviors.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In addition to these conceptual tools, researchers might want to emphasize
the key substantive themes or dimensions associated with paternal involvement.
These would include fathers' nurturing and provisioning, moral and ethical
guidance, emotional, practical, and psychosocial support of female partners,
and economic provisioning or breadwinning (Figure 1).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><U>The nurturance and provision of care</U> to young children has typically
been assessed using time use data on fathers' activities and it has been
referred to in the literature as "paternal involvement" (Lamb et al., 1987;
Pleck, 1997). While most observers view fathers' nurturance as a desirable
form of fathering, there continues to be widespread disagreement about the
importance of this dimension relative to other aspects of fathering. When
it is evaluated positively, its importance may still vary depending on the
age and gender of the children. Even though (or perhaps because) this dimension
approximates "mothering" in many respects, it is almost universally viewed
as secondary--less important than mothering by mothers, and less important
than the other dimensions of fatherhood.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Second, <U>moral and ethical guidance</U> is viewed as a core feature
of fatherhood within most religious traditions even though, in reality, most
such guidance or socialization within the family is performed by mothers.
Furthermore, when fathers are involved in socialization of this sort, their
impact may be indirectly mediated by children's identification with and imitation
of their fathers, regardless of any efforts on the fathers' part.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>A third aspect involves the <U>emotional, practical, and psychosocial
support of female partners</U> (biological mothers or stepmothers). When
this third aspect of father involvement is loosely defined, it can also refer
to aspects of social capital derived from coparental relations noted
earlier.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Finally, <U>economic provisioning, or breadwinning</U>, is the dimension
of fatherhood that is probably viewed by many of the stakeholders who define
fatherhood as one of the most central aspects to fatherhood and paternal
involvement. This dimension has clearly been one of the focal points of many
social policy and programatic efforts during the past two decades.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>While fathers and evaluators in most subcultural groups tend to acknowledge
each of these dimensions of fatherhood to some extent, they may have different
views about their relative importance. Thus, it is not very informative to
ask individuals about the personal significance of fatherhood without first
ascertaining what it means to them and their children. Unfortunately, few
researchers have done this; consequently, the motivational bases of fatherhood
or paternal involvement remain poorly understood. When studies have been
conducted, it is not always clear that the researchers' conception of fatherhood
matches the respondents'. In addition, different metrics are needed to assess
the fulfillment of each dimension of fatherhood, and performance is easier
to measure in some areas (e.g., economic provisioning) than others (e.g.,
moral guidance). Outside narrow research contexts, the easiest data to gather
involve fathers' time use and economic provisioning, though in neither case
do the available statistics directly and clearly tap either fathers' involvement
or motivations. Moreover, these and other measures of fathers' involvement
and subjective phenomena related to fathers are fraught with complex measurement
issues resulting from different family members providing competing assessments
of relevant variables (see Braver, Wolchik, Sandler, Fogas, and Zvetina,
1991; Seltzer and Brandreth, 1995; Smith and Morgan, 1994). Nevertheless,
numerous studies indicate that a considerable amount of similarity exists
between fathers' assessments of their involvement and their wives' reports
(see Pleck, 1997).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Time Use Data and "Paternal Involvement" Measures</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Much of the research on paternal involvement has examined how much
time fathers spend with their children and what sorts of activities occupy
that time (Lamb, Pleck, Charnov, and Levine, 1985; 1997; Pleck, 1983; 1997).
Many of these studies involve small and often unrepresentative samples--a
perennial problem in developmental research. Fortunately, this area of research
has recently been augmented by several studies based on nationally representative
samples of individuals (both mothers and fathers, e.g., NSFH) who have been
asked what fathers do and how much they do.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Given the availability of these data, it would seem easy to determine
what contemporary fathers really do. Sadly, the task is not as easy as it
sounds because the results of different surveys vary dramatically. One problem
is that different researchers have invoked very different implicit definitions
of parental involvement, using different activities as aspects of paternal
involvement. Thus, it is very difficult to compare results.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Components of involvement.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>One way to make
sense of these data is to first group the studies according to the implicit
definitions of paternal involvement they use. For analytic purposes, it is
useful to consider the three components of parental involvement as they were
originally outlined by Lamb et al. (1987). The first and most restrictive
type is time spent in actual one-on-one interaction with a child (whether
feeding her, helping him with homework, or playing catch on the sidewalk).
This form of time use, which Lamb and his colleagues labeled
<U>engagement</U> or interaction, does not include time spent in child-related
housework or time spent sitting in one room while the child plays in the
next room. This latter type of time use represents a second category comprised
of activities involving less intense degrees of interaction. These activities
imply parental <U>accessibility</U> to the child, rather than direct interaction.
Cooking in the kitchen while the child plays in the next room, or even cooking
in the kitchen while the child plays at the parent's feet, are examples.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The final type of involvement is the hardest to define but is perhaps
the most important of all. It taps the extent to which the parent takes ultimate
<I>responsibility</I> for the child's welfare and care. It can be illustrated
by the difference between being responsible for child care and being able
and willing to "help out" when it is convenient. Responsibility involves
knowing when the child needs to go to the pediatrician, making the appointment,
and making sure that the child gets to it. Responsibility involves making
child-care and babysitting arrangements, ensuring that the child has clothes
to wear, and making arrangements for supervision when the child is sick.
Much of the time involved in being a responsible parent is not spent in direct
interaction with the child. Consequently, survey researchers can easily overlook
this type of involvement.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Quantifying the time involved in the responsibility component to
involvement is difficult, particularly because the anxiety, worry, and
contingency planning that comprise parental responsibility often occur when
the parent is ostensibly doing something else. Unfortunately, and as noted
earlier, while the mental work associated with parenting is quite important,
and most salient to this third type of time use, researchers have focused
little attention on how and the degree to which fathers actually think about
their children (Palkovitz, 1997). One notable exception is Walzer's (1996)
qualitative analysis of the gendered patterns associated with parental care
of infants. Not surprisingly, this study revealed that new mothers are much
more likely than fathers to think independently about and plan for their
infant's care.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Problems in Consistency</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>When the three different types of parental involvement covered in the
more recent studies are differentiated, greater consistency is found from
study to study than was apparent in earlier studies (Rebelsky and Hanks,
1971; DeFrain, 1975), but a considerable degree of inconsistency remains.
In part, this is because the distinction between the three types of involvement
has been applied retrospectively to the results of independent studies conducted
years earlier. Thus, there are still differences across studies in specific
definitions of engagement, accessibility, and responsibility. For example,
in one study using a major national survey, `'watching TV together" was grouped
with activities of the interaction type, whereas in another study, it was
included as a component of accessibility.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>To integrate and compare the findings of different studies, each
researcher's idiosyncratic definition of involvement must be allowed to stand,
but relative rather than absolute measures of paternal involvement must be
used to compare results. Instead of comparing those figures purporting to
measure the amount of time that fathers spend "interacting with" their children,
proportional figures must first be computed (i.e., compared with the amount
of time that mothers devote to interaction, how much time do fathers devote
to it) and these proportional figures can then be compared. When this strategy
is used, the picture becomes much clearer. Surprisingly similar results are
obtained in the various studies, despite major differences in the methods
used to assess time use (diary versus estimate), the size and regional
representation of the samples employed, and the date when the studies were
conducted.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Time proportions.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Lamb et al.'s (1987) review
of data for two-parent families in which the mother is unemployed, suggested
that the average father spent about 20% to 25% as much time as the mother
did in direct interaction or engagement with their children, and about a
third as much time being accessible to their children (see also Pleck, 1983;
1997). The largest discrepancy between paternal and maternal involvement
was in the area of responsibility. Many studies show that fathers assume
essentially no responsibility (as previously defined) for their children's
care or rearing. In two-parent families with an employed mother, the levels
of paternal compared with maternal engagement and accessibility are both
substantially higher than in families with an unemployed mother (Lamb et
al., 1987; Pleck, 1983; 1997). Lamb et al. (1987) reported figures for direct
interaction and accessibility averaging 33% and 65%, respectively, whereas
Pleck's later review reported that the averages had increased to 44% and
66%. As far as responsibility is concerned, however, there is no evidence
that maternal employment has any effect on the level of paternal involvement.
Even when both mother and father are employed 30 or more hours per week,
the amount of responsibility assumed by fathers appears as negligible as
when mothers are unemployed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In light of the controversies that have arisen on this score, it is
noteworthy that fathers do not appear to spend more time interacting with
their children when mothers are employed; rather the proportions just cited
go up only because mothers are doing less. Thus, fathers are proportionately
more involved when mothers are employed, even though the depth of their
involvement in absolute terms, does not change to any meaningful extent.
The unfortunate controversies in this area appear attributable to a difference
between proportional figures and absolute figures. On the other hand, studies
focused on time use pay scant attention to the quality of maternal and paternal
behavior. Maternal employment has probably led to changes in the types of
activities in which fathers engage and new studies may show increases in
the extent of paternal responsibility.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Although spending time with children may or may not represent an important
aspect of fatherhood to the individuals concerned, time diary studies have
shown that the amount of time fathers spend with their children is associated
with socioeconomic class membership (lower class fathers tend to spend more
time with their children), age (fathers spend more time with younger than
with older children), and gender (fathers spend more time with boys than
with girls).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B>Positive paternal involvement</B>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>A recent development in the conceptualization and measurement of paternal
involvement includes a series of efforts that focus on the positive content
of fathers' behaviors (for a review, see Pleck, 1997). Thus, in the past
decade or so, a growing number of scholars have begun to systematically think
about and measure the content of paternal involvement (e.g., Amato, 1987;
McBride, 1990; McBride and Mills, 1993; Radin, 1994; Snarey, 1993; Volling
and Belsky, 1991). For example, using her Paternal Index of Child Care
Involvement (PICCI), Radin (1994) has been able to tap five different dimensions
of positive paternal involvement which she labels; statement of involvement,
child-care responsibility, socialization responsibility, influence in
childrearing decisions, and accessibility.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Some of the most promising new work on conceptualizing positive paternal
involvement draws upon the generative fathering perspective. In particular,
Palkovitz's (1997) expanded conceptualization of paternal involvement should
be appealing to those researchers and policymakers who have become more sensitive
to the myriad ways fathers affect their children's development and well-being.
By restructuring and expanding its treatment of the involvement concept,
this <I>preliminary</I> framework may generate a new wave of research on
fathers. In addition to his expanded interpretation of the ways fathers can
be involved with their children, and his interest in the specific domains
in which this involvement operates, Palkovitz explores how paternal involvement
can be understood by considering a series of simultaneously occurring continua
(described below). Palkovitz, by drawing attention to the continua theme,
reminds researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds that thinking of
fathers as being either more or less involved in their children's lives in
a global sense does little to advance our understanding of paternal involvement,
or how fathers' involvement affects children's well-being and development.
Instead, it is more meaningful to assess the specific ways fathers are involved
with their children in terms of various co-occurring continua.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We briefly discuss five of these continua (time invested, degree of
involvement, observability, salience, directness) and mention two others
(proximity and appropriateness). The most obvious continuum, and one that
we discussed earlier, involves the amount of time fathers invest in any
particular form of paternal involvement. When conceptualizing paternal
involvement, it is important to keep in mind that the time fathers invest
in their children's lives does not always reflect their degree or depth of
involvement. Some fathers, for instance, may spend little time playing with
their children, but their degree of involvement in this area may be quite
high if they make important decisions about how their children's playtime
is structured. Other fathers may spend a great deal of time doing certain
things with or for their children, but they may invest little of their heart
and soul into these situations. They may simply be going through the motions
of being involved.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We would also want to be aware of how observable fathers' involvement
may be in certain situations (a consideration that is relevant to research
and debates that deal with how parenting patterns are influenced by cultural
factors, developmental trajectories, and gender differences). Fathers' thoughts
about monitoring, planning, or worrying about their children's lives may
not represent observable behaviors, but this cognitive activity may significantly
influence how they interact with their children in different settings. Those
fathers who think at length about how they might help their children deal
with personal problems or developmental issues are much more likely to be
well-prepared to be involved with their children in a positive manner than
fathers who respond to their children without such deliberation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Another continuum relates to the degree of saliency the paternal function
or task has for fathers and their subjective interpretation of this activity.
This continuum appears to be closely related to the "degree of involvement"
continuum. In some instances, tasks may be highly relevant to fathers because
they are aversive or pleased with them. Situations where fathers are completely
indifferent to some form of paternal involvement represent one of the extreme
poles of the saliency continuum.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The final continuum we mention here is the extent to which involvement
is direct or indirect. Given the longstanding importance of the traditional
male breadwinner role, much of what fathers have done for their children
can be viewed in this way. Resident fathers who work overtime to provider
financially for their children are engaged in indirect forms of involvement.
Likewise, nonresident fathers who pay child support or monitor their children's
lives through third parties are indirectly involved.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>While it is beyond the scope of our report to describe or critique
this particular approach in more detail, we suspect that scholars with
allegiances to various disciplines or methodologies would stand to benefit
by becoming more familiar with at least some of this framework's central
themes. This work reminds us that efforts to better understand paternal
involvement as a multidimensional construct are clearly warranted. Fox and
Bruce (1996) provide us with a good beginning by developing an inventory
of constructs depicting fathering that is organized according to three categories
they label, evaluative, attitude/belief, and behavior. After reviewing the
literature on men's parenting behavior, they conclude that the conceptualization
of fathering behaviors is thin in several areas that involve: a) the potential
for child-specific parenting, b) role sharing and role spelling between father
and mothers, c) role cycling or the rotation among fathers' varied activities
as disciplinarian, nurturer, etc., d) the distinction between fathers'
investments in the status of father versus the process of fathering, and
e) the potentially different perceptions of fathering experiences among men
from different sociocultural backgrounds. Their largely social psychological
approach is relevant to many of the points we make in this report and can
serve as a springboard for refining the conceptualization of paternal involvement
and proposing future areas of research.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Father's Role as Economic Provider.</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>As noted above, the role of economic provider is fundamental to most
persons' definition of fatherhood and is a critical form of paternal involvement,
broadly defined. For these reasons, and given its policy significance, we
specifically discuss in this section fathers' provision of money for food,
clothing, shelter and other consumption items. While the economic provide
role is also linked to symbolic aspects relating to power, intergenerational
transmission of values (e.g., work ethic), and the family connections to
the larger community (e.g., social capital), we defer our discussion of some
of these issues to our subsequent section on <U>family process</U>.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Economic resources.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>To assess the importance
of the economic provider role for children, we first need to ask whether
increased economic resources enhance children's well-being. As Brooks-Gunn
and Duncan (1997) decisively show in <U>The Consequences of Growing Up
Poor</U><I>, </I>economic resources are particularly important during early
and middle childhood, especially for cognitive outcomes. Specifically, higher
income is associated with a richer learning
environment.<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP> In addition, it is suggested
that economic resources matter in part because economic instability (e.g.,
unstable work, income loss, etc.) can lead to marital conflict which itself
has negative consequences for children (Conger and Conger, 1997).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Although the results cited above are suggestive of several mechanisms
through which economic resources can influence child outcomes, many unanswered
questions remain. For example, what is the tradeoff between time and money?
Fathers who provide more money to the family often do so at the cost of spending
less time with their families. Is the choice of money over time beneficial
for children and for other aspects of father involvement with children? Some
literature suggests that there is an interaction between being perceived
as a good provider (and thus spending a substantial amount of time in the
labor force) and the quality of time that fathers spend with their
children.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Decisions about money.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>A second question
relates to whether fathers spend money in different ways than do mothers,
and which parent has more power over spending decisions. The recent household
bargaining literature in economics presents evidence that children are better
off (higher calorie intake, lower mortality rates, more education) when mothers
have more autonomy over spending decisions. This evidence may suggest that
mothers spend money in ways that are more "child friendly" than do fathers.
However, there is little direct evidence on spending patterns for specific
individuals within the household. To address the kinds of questions posed
above, we need data that combine information on family spending patterns,
time allocation, and measures of child outcomes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>A related question is how much of the family income is spent on children
as opposed to adults? There is a large literature on this topic (see Betson,
1990 for a review). Estimates of the proportion of family income spent on
one child range from 16% to 33%. Estimates for two children range from 27%
to 49% of income. Thus a substantial proportion of family income is consumed
directly by children. Lazear and Michael (1988) find that the proportion
spent on children varies by characteristics of the household. More highly
educated and older parents spend a larger proportion of income on children.
Households with two working parents also spend more.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Nonresident fathers and economic
provisioning</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> The literature on the "cost of children"
has been used by policymakers to assess how much absent parents (predominantly
fathers) should pay to support their children. As part of the Family Support
Act of 1988 all states were required to implement numerical formulas called
child support guidelines specifying how much child support an absent parent
should pay. These guidelines were intended to mimic the amount of income
a nonresident parent would have spent on a child had he/she been living with
that child. These guidelines have been criticized both by women's groups
as being too low and by fathers' groups as being too high. However, there
is some evidence that guidelines may make it easier for parents to reach
cooperative agreements by creating a sense of fairness about the process
(Argys et al., 1997). When child support agreements are cooperative, fathers
are more likely to pay (Nord and Zill, 1996a).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Payment of support</B>. </FONT></I><FONT>Despite legislative
efforts during the 1980s to increase the frequency and size of child support
awards and reduce delinquency in child support payments, many nonresident
fathers still do not pay any formal child support. In 1991, 66% of ever married
custodial mothers had a child support award compared to only 27% for never
married mothers. Half of the nonresident fathers (51%) who owed child support
paid the full amount; 24% paid a partial amount, and the remaining 25% paid
nothing. Overall, about 38% of custodial mothers received any formal child
support, and the mean amount received was $3,011 (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1995).<SUP><A HREF="c4.htm#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Data and research on the provider role of nonresident fathers usually
focus on formal child support awards and payments. However, nonresident fathers
may also provide support for their children informally through monetary or
nonmonetary contributions to the mother. Data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY) shows that even in the absence of a legal child support
award agreement, some fathers voluntarily provide informal financial support.
For instance, among a child support-eligible sample in the NLSY with no awards,
24% of divorced or separated mothers and 47% of mothers of children born
outside of marriage reported receiving at least some monetary child support
from fathers since their eligibility (Argys, Peters, Brooks-Gunn and Smith,
1996).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Even fathers in marginal or economically unstable conditions are found
to contribute food, diapers, clothing, and some financial assistance informally
(Hardy, Duggan, Masnyk, and Pearson, 1989; Sullivan, 1993). Interviews with
155 young unmarried fathers enrolled in a pilot project indicated that many
of these fathers preferred to purchase items and services for their children
rather than to pay money directly to the mother or the child support office
(Achatz and MacAllum, 1994). Fathers pointed out that buying needed items
allowed them to directly provide support and maintain control over how their
money was spent. In addition, they viewed these tangible contributions as
symbols of responsible fatherhood that gained them respect in their community.
A study of 214 mothers on AFDC (Edin, 1994) revealed that fathers assumed
more financial responsibility for their children informally than through
the formal child support system. One-third of the women in the sample reported
regular financial support from the fathers, while only 14% received this
support through the formal child support enforcement system. An additional
30% of mothers reported that in lieu of monetary support, fathers provided
items, such as disposable diapers, school clothing and shoes, and/or Christmas
and birthday gifts. Similarly, Greene and Moore (1996) examined early descriptive
data from the Jobs Opportunities and Basic Skills Child Outcomes Study and
found that while about 17% of fathers provided child support through the
formal system during the past year, 42% provided informal support, such as
money, groceries, clothes, or other items directly to the mother.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Child support and well-being. </I></B>There is a growing literature
on the relationship between child support and child well-being (see Garfinkle
and McLanahan, 1994; Nord and Zill, 1996b). Generally, studies find that
child support has positive effects on children's cognitive achievement and
educational attainment that cannot be accounted for solely by the financial
contribution of child support. The reason for this positive correlation is
complex. One hypothesis is that success in fulfilling the economic provider
role may free fathers to become involved with their children in other beneficial
ways. Another theory suggests that fathers who pay child support may want
to continue to see their children as a way of monitoring that investment
(Weiss and Willis, 1985). Alternatively, the causation could go in the other
direction. Fathers may agree to pay child support only as a means to maintain
access to their children. Finally, it is possible that there is a third factor
that would lead some fathers to have high levels of both time and money
involvement (e.g., altruism towards children).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Stepfathers' and male partners' economic provisioning.
</I></B>Very little is known about the economic contributions stepfathers
and male partners in cohabiting relationships make to the household and to
their partner's children. Generally speaking, stepfathers' income is included
in total family income when determining eligibility for welfare benefits,
whereas in many states male partners' incomes are not included. Similarly,
an important policy debate in formulating child support guidelines is how
(or whether) to account for the additional economic obligations a nonresident
father may incur if he remarries. These policies are based on certain assumptions
about the degree to which stepparents or male partners provide economic resources
to children, but, at present, there is little data on which to base these
assumptions.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Motivation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Having briefly reviewed some of the types and potential consequences
of fathers' involvement, it is useful to discuss the key conceptual issues
concerning fatherhood, paternal involvement, and motivation. Men may have
somewhat separate, yet interrelated views about biological paternity, aspects
of social and "responsible" fatherhood, and specific ways of being involved
with their children. Obviously, then, different conceptions or definitions
of concepts are likely to be associated with different sets of motivations.
We must also recognize that in many respects men's desires to procreate are
often intimately related to their perceptions about assuming specific social
father roles (e.g., economic provider, nurturer), and their commitment to
being "responsible" fathers (Marsiglio, 1995a; forthcoming; Tanfer and Mott,
1997). Furthermore, our discussion of motivation issues is affected by our
decision to incorporate men's prenatal roles into our conceptualization of
social fatherhood.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Reasons for involvement. </I></B>We are mainly concerned with
men's motivations to become "responsible" social fathers who are committed
to enhancing their children's well-being through their positive involvement
with them. Conceptions of fatherhood, as well as the extent to which individual
fathers are motivated to behave in a responsible manner, appear to be shaped
by cultural images of fatherhood represented in the media and other outlets,
as well as men's socio-cultural background, their current social circumstances,
and their earlier experiences, particularly the behavior of their own parents.
More specifically, some of the principle reasons men are motivated to become
social fathers are because they want:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>1. the experience of caring for and raising children,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>2. an opportunity to strengthen their bond with their romantic
partners,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>3. to ensure that they are not lonely or financially vulnerable in
their later years of life, or,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>4. to feel more connected to their extended family and/or friends.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Likewise, men's motivation to be responsible fathers who are positively
involved with their children my stem from some of the aforementioned factors
as well as:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>1. their genuine love for their children,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>2. societal and familial pressures to act like masculine adult males
(the "shame" factor in the extreme), and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>3. their perceptions of how much their children need their involvement
or financial resources owing to their perception of their sexual partner's
(or former partner's) financial and relationship circumstances.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>As we consider how these or other motivations may prompt fathers to
strive to be responsible fathers, we should be aware that this task is made
more difficult when we acknowledge the multiple ways in which paternal
involvement can be expressed. Moreover, the diverse views held by the various
stakeholders about what constitutes "good fathering" adds to this
complexity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Instead of trying to rank motivations in order of importance or associate
them with specific expressions or dimensions of fatherhood, it may be more
productive to enumerate the most important motivational or explanatory categories
that have been hypothesized, recognizing that the empirical research in this
area is scanty, at best. As expected, scholars with ties to anthropology,
developmental psychological, life course perspectives, social psychology,
sociobiology, and sociology each tend to address motivational issues from
a different perspective.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Socio-biological motivations.</B>
</FONT></I><FONT>Sociobiologists, for example, emphasize that both men and
women strive to maximize the representation of their genes in future generations.
Several implications flow from their observation that males (unlike females)
can be biologically involved in many pregnancies simultaneously and do not
need to make major physiological contributions to the physical survival of
their offspring after insemination. The `down side,' according to these same
theorists, is that men can never really be sure of paternity, and thus always
face the risk of investing resources in someone else's children (genes).
Several predictions flow from these simple (if controversial)
observations:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>1. Men invest less in individual offspring because the opportunity
costs are so much lower and the risks of mis-investment are so much higher
than they are for women.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>2. Men support their partners and offspring economically and socially
(rather than physiologically).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>3. Biologically determined differences in male and female investment
may continue after delivery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>4. Like mothers, fathers invest time in the care and rearing of their
children in order to bring children to reproductive maturity. Unlike mothers,
their behavior does not appear to be hormonally facilitated.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>5. The more men invest in partners and their children, the more they
want to be sure of paternity; the extent to which they provide economic and
socio-emotional support may affect the extent to which their partners' later
children have the same fathers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>6. The fewer the children, the greater the motivation to invest time
and resources in the success of each.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The clarity of some of these predictions is offset by the fact that
the motivations are unconscious and must therefore be studied, not by probing
attitudes and values in interviews, but by studying the effects, often at
the level of population groups rather than individuals. Fortunately, the
desire to be a father isn't driven solely (or even consciously) by the desire
to propagate one's genes, and sociobiological explanations in terms of ultimate
causes involve a different level of analysis than psychological and sociological
explanations.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Generativity.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Theorists who stress developmental
issues and the generativity theme contend that some fathers are motivated
to be involved with their children because such involvement is related to
healthy adult development (Hawkins and Dollahite, 1997; Palkovitz, 1997;
Snarey, 1993). Many individuals find fulfillment in shaping the growth and
development of another person, and this type of experience represents a
motivating force for some fathers. Such participation is hard to quantify
empirically, but time-use measures come closest, especially when they illuminate
both what and how much fathers do for or with their children. Moreover, large
scale studies do not measure how well fathers perform these roles or tasks
-- that is the focus of smaller scale studies that are informed by direct
observation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The type and extent of individual involvement in fathering may also
be affected by recollections of the fathering men experienced as children
as well as their interpretation of other men's fathering behaviors in specific
social situations. Some men (particularly those who embrace higher levels
of hands-on involvement and avoid being defined solely by breadwinning) are
motivated to emulate the behavior of their fathers while others who behave
in this way are apparently driven by a desire to be better fathers than their
own fathers (Fox and Bruce, 1996). Meanwhile, Daly's (1995) recent qualitative
work suggests that fathers may be less likely to turn to concrete figures
to model their behavior and more likely to pick and choose actions, values,
and standards that are displayed by various parents they encounter in their
everyday lives.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Maturity and status</B>. </FONT></I><FONT>Meanwhile, theorists
who focus on life course, identity, and gender issues shed light on some
men's motivations by suggesting that being a father denotes maturity and
confers status in many societies and subcultures. Fathers can reap the benefits
of social status when their partners and children are well-provisioned and
successful (as denoted by school performance, sports achievement, college
admissions, and career attainment). Attitude surveys may indicate the relative
if not absolute importance of these motivations, as well as differing perceptions
of the ways in which these desired outcomes can best be hastened by coaching,
supervision, warmth, play, and physical provisioning.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In a related social psychological vein, identity theory (Marsiglio,
1995d; Ihninger-Tallman, Pasley, and Buehler, 1995) has been extended to
address issues associated with men's paternal identity and involvement. This
model emphasizes fathers' <U>commitment</U> to role identities that are
negotiated within the context of structured role relationships. As such,
it implicitly deals with motivational issues in that fathers' commitment
to being a particular type of man, partner, and father may affect their desire
to be involved with their children in specific ways. This perspective is
valuable because it draws attention to the interpersonal and social context
within which men develop their individual dispositions to think, feel, and
act toward their children. Moreover, it provides a theoretically meaningful
link between fathers' perceptions of themselves and their actual paternal
involvement. By emphasizing identity within a complex relational context,
this theory also points out how coparental issues may condition men's involvement
with their resident and nonresident children (Fox and Bruce, 1996). We deal
more explicitly and at greater length with these concerns in the next two
sections.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><U>Moderating factors</U>. To conclude this section, we build upon
the work of Palkovitz (1997) and Lamb and his colleagues (1987) to summarize
the types of factors that condition or moderate fathers' positive involvement
with their children. We discuss three broad types: individual, interactional
context/process, and macro/meso. As seen in Figure 2, these diverse factors
range from developmental and life course considerations for both fathers
and their children, to factors associated with the context and processes
that shape fathers' interactions with their children (e.g., mothers, school
officials), to more macro/meso types of factors that affect fathers' rights
and opportunities to be involved with their children in particular ways.
Together, these types of factors shape the overall context within which paternal
involvement is expressed and evaluation occurs.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>FAMILY PROCESSES AND FATHERING</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>As was mentioned in the beginning of this report, fundamental social
changes in family structure and generalized definitions of gender roles have
raised many questions about the significance of fathers and their interactions
with children. In this section, we expand on the dyadic and triadic interactions
(with a focus on paternal-child interaction) used to described "family process"
(sometimes called family dynamics) and their relationship to important child
well-being outcomes.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Definition.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Family process informs us about
how family members think, feel, and act toward each other in their relationships
( Brodrick, 1993; McKenry and Price, 1994). By definition, family process
is measured by assessing the shared relationships of multiple family members.
This level of analysis is interactional and the focus is the family group
instead of individual or macro-levels. For example, two or more family members'
perceptions about how individuality and intimacy are tolerated in a family
represents a family process measure (Gavazzi, 1994).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Family process and social capital.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>One promising
model of how family dynamics are employed to enhance the lives of children
can be found in the theoretical work of Coleman (1988). He suggests that
the co-parental relationship and the dyadic relationship between parent and
child represent a resource and these resources are inherently dyadic. He
further posits that the level of social capital available from the father
that<U> could</U> be transmitted to the child can only be transferred in
the context of higher quality dyadic relationships. Higher quality might
be, for example, spending time together (a primary feature of the interaction
theme in Lamb's work) but is more likely to be found in the <U>nature</U>
of the interaction. In particular, higher quality interaction exists when
the father is more supportive, has higher levels of effective communication,
understands appropriate distance regulation, and is appropriately flexible,
his resource base (either human, financial, or social capital) is more likely
to be transferable to the child.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The effects of being able to transfer resources is critical and varies
by ethnicity and gender. Additionally, the processes are different depending
the life course phases of family members and family structure features (i.e.
the age of the child, age of parent, number of siblings at home, etc.).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Steelman and Doby (1983) and Rumberger (1983) have found strong links
between parental resources and high school completion rates as well as
offspring's cognitive skills. These results are modified by the parent-child
relationship and vary by race (black/white). Further, when children are young
at the time of parental separation, fathers' human capital is more influential
when they have close contact with their children (Amato, 1998). Future research
in this area needs to examine the effects paternal and maternal income <I>vis
a vis</I> family process variables.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Such work is valuable as researchers continue to explore the links
between important issues such as poverty and children's well being. Financial
capital, distributed in the context of a caring and appropriately supervised
parent/child relationships, may be substantially more effective in reducing
the effects of lower education, poverty, and higher crime rates than the
dispersing of money only. By understanding family processes, we may improve
our ability to unravel the question of what fathers potentially contribute
to the family besides provisioning and limited child care.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Assumptions About Family Processes</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>To understand how fathers fit into the discussion of family process,
four assumptions need to be examined. First, family process describes the
non-static ongoing dynamics of interaction found within a family unit. Second,
it is often assumed that most of what happens in families is hidden or latent
even to the family. It is only through multi-perception research that researchers
can begin to have some understanding about those dynamics. Third, it is assumed
that family process interactions are recurring, repetitive patterns of
interaction. Therefore, over time, family members (or an observer) can begin
to notice and record these redundant patterns of interaction and then induce
from them attendant rule structures and belief systems that drive the
redundancies. Fourth, family processes usually reflect hierarchically structured
rules and interactions. The rules and patterns of interaction tell us who
is in charge, who should do what at certain times, who can change the rules,
and who can administer them. Often these rules of hierarchy tell us about
gendered power differences or cultural imperatives that shape domination
patterns within the redundancies.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Examples of Family Processes</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>A perusal of scholarly family process literature manifests only a few
recurring family process ideas. From the larger list of family processes
only three examples will be discussed in depth here and they are: <I>distance
regulation</I> (i.e., enmeshment, individuation, boundary definition,
triangulation, and family intrusiveness), <I>flexibility</I> (i.e., adaptability,
coping), and<I> support</I><B>.</B> A short list of other family process
constructs not discussed here are: supervision/ monitoring (which includes
rule setting, rule implementation) affection (which includes levels of
generosity, caring, loving, and kindness) communication; and
ritualization).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>While family process has clearly been shown to have much to do with
understanding the well-being of children, unfortunately, research explaining
how fathers contribute to these processes is relatively underdeveloped. The
selected family processes discussed below have a research tradition and clear
methodologies for acquiring data on mothers' and fathers' contribution to
children's well-being. Even so, little research on these processes has been
conducted that focuses specifically on fathers. Perhaps the exception to
this notion is the work on power differences in families. Differentials in
power between parents (when there are two) greatly influence the family dynamics
associated with decision-making, resource allocation, and goal
attainment.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Distance Regulation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Distance regulation contains two primary dimensions: (1) the parent's
tolerance for individuality, or the relative tolerance that the system displays
for each member to experience a sense of separateness from the family, and
(2) the parent's tolerance for intimacy, or the relative tolerance that the
system displays for members to be connected emotionally and psychologically
to the family (Gavazzi, 1993).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Individuality and intimacy.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Distance regulation
patterns that tolerate both individuality from the family and intimacy within
the family create a well-differentiated family system. If the distance regulation
patterns display high tolerance for only one dimension of family differentiation
-- individuality or intimacy -- the family is thought to have a moderate
level of differentiation. Here, families that retain a sense of intimacy
but do not tolerate individuality well have been labeled "enmeshed," whereas
families that tolerate individuality among its members without retaining
a sense of intimate belonging have been labeled "disengaged" (Minuchin, 1974).
Finally, distance regulation patterns that do not tolerate individuality
claims and do not tolerate intimacy within the family are thought to be poorly
differentiated (Gavazzi et al., 1994).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Individual family members contribute to family differentiation through
their multiple interactions with other members of the family, and each member
does have their own personal experiences of their family system. By definition,
however, no one individual family member can retain a level of family
differentiation. Further, the level of family differentiation is not the
mere summarization of each member's contribution to the family, but a latent
construct derived from the response of each family member.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Adolescence and distance regulation.</B>
</FONT></I><FONT>Distance regulation in the family has received increased
theoretical and clinical attention in recent years, especially regarding
families with adolescents (Allison and Sabatelli, 1988; Anderson and Sabatelli,
1990; Sabatelli and Mazor, 1985). While most of these researchers focus on
parent-child relationships, few differentiate between the gender of the child
or parent and how distance regulation may differ for each. Nevertheless,
distance regulation strategies between parent (father and/or mother) and
child vary greatly by family with differing outcomes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The ways in which the father and mother regulate individuation and
familial intimacy affect the adolescent's ability to make a successful transition
into adulthood status (Carter and McGoldrick, 1989; Farley, 1979; Kerr and
Bowen, 1988; Lapsley, 1993; Lopez and Gover, 1993). Basically, this family
process is the mechanism by which parents promote or retard the development
of appropriate child autonomy. One researcher (Broderick, 1993) speaks of
family distance regulation as the primary mechanism that defines the bonding
and buffering processes associated with healthy functioning in the family
with adolescents. Family distance regulation is defined as the amount of
individuality and the amount of intimacy that are tolerated within a family
system.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Empirical Work on Family Distance Regulation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Recently, studies have generated an empirical foundation for these
theoretical and clinical writings, especially with regard to families with
adolescents. For instance, Gavazzi (1993) discussed how severity levels in
a variety of presenting problems (e.g., school-related difficulties, peer
relationship problems, individually oriented difficulties, and illegal
activities) could be predicted by differentiation levels in the family. Also,
Gavazzi (1994a) reported that distance regulation levels were predictive
of Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach and Edelrock, 1983) total problem
scores. Other studies have noted similar links between levels of family
differentiation and more specific problematic behaviors in adolescents. Bartle
and Sabatelli (1989) reported a link between family differentiation levels
and alcohol-related difficulties in adolescents. Sabatelli and Anderson (1991)
found a relationship between family differentiation and adolescents' levels
of depression and anxiety. Finally, Gavazzi, Anderson, and Sabatelli (1993)
reported that both psychosocial development and problematic behaviors in
adolescents were significantly predicted by family differentiation levels,
a finding replicated by Gavazzi, Goettler, Solomon, and McKenry (1994).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Gender differences.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>While this research
has a promising theoretical and empirical record, little has been done to
look at parent gender differences. For example, we do not know if different
levels of intimacy tolerance by fathers (versus mothers) has differential
familial effects. Nor do we know if it is better (or not) for both parents
to agree on a "family" level of tolerance and individuation. Also, little
is known about the child outcomes when there is only one parent or only one
physically present parent (and the other one is psychologically or physically
absent). Neither do we know if there are cultural differences that promote
different levels of distance regulation.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Problems in distance regulation.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>However,
families with distance regulation problems (for fathers and mothers) report
more pathological indicators, including depressive disorders (Asarnow, Goldstein,
et al., 1993), disruptive behavior and obsessive-compulsive disorders (Hibbs,
Hamburger, et al., 1991; Hibbs, Hamburger, et al., 1993), eating disorders
(Grange, Eisler, et al., 1992), and aggressive and non-aggressive attention
deficit hyperactivity disorders (Marshall, Longwell, et al., 1990). Additionally,
these families are more likely to report that their teen is involved in "at
risk" psychopathological conditions (Albers, Doane, and Mintz, 1986; Cook,
Kenny, and Goldstein, 1991; Schwartz, Dorer, et al., 1990; Valone, Goldstein,
and Norton, 1984). In general, these studies have linked higher levels of
expressed emotion in the family to lower levels of intrapsychic and interpersonal
functioning in both clinical and non-clinical adolescent samples. Initial
results by Gavazzi (in press) indicate that the distance regulation style
of the father may have a greater impact on pre-teen and teenage children
than the mother's style. Certainly more research is needed to understand
these processes better.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Father and distance regulation.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>In a recent
study by Bartle and Gavazzi (1994), it was found that by analyzing the influence
of the father's distance regulation behaviors, one could significantly predict
better adolescent outcomes such as behavior problems and ease of on-time
developmental transitions. When analyses were conducted in which fathers'
and mothers' data were combined, the effect was still there, but when run
with mothers' data only the effects disappeared. In other words, when the
relationship between father and adolescent (irrespective of gender of child)
was strong (i.e., appropriate levels of distance regulation) the child was
much less likely to be in trouble with school and/or the law. When that
relationship was poor they were much more likely to report problems with
both school and local police.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In another study, Gavazzi (in press) reports that father's scores on
family distance regulation (in a sample of involved and active fathers) is
very different than that of the mother's and/or the teen in a family. In
other words, the father's perception of what happens in the family does not
statistically resemble the mother's or the teen's and yet the mother's and
teen's perception statistically converge. Even when he is there and contributing
in a positive way, his view of what is going on inside the family is quite
different than other family members. His view is so remarkably different
that the statistical models rejected the father's scores as coming from the
same family to which he belonged.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Such studies create a research imperative in which multiple views of
family events,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>feelings, and goals are measured. Only when these family process measures
are done with representative large scale studies will we have the confidence
to suggest specific policy recommendations about the role of the father in
enhancing children's well-being.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Flexibility</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>An increasingly large amount of family-based literature has been devoted
to the study of the amount of flexibility families display in response to
internal and external demands for change. In essence, it is believed that
families able to demonstrate greater flexibility in the face of demands for
change will respond in more healthy ways thereby meeting the needs of its
individual members (Terkleson, 1980). This literature contains a number of
constructs related to flexibility in the family, including similar constructs
which have been used in family research. Among these are adaptability (Olson,
Sprenkle, and Russell, 1983; Lewis, Beavers, Gossett, and Phillips, 1976)
family problem-solving ability (Aldous et al., 1971; Reiss and Oliveri, 1980)
and family coping styles (McCubbin et al., 1980; McKenry and Price,
1994).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Definition.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Flexibility assesses the degree
to which members are able to change the power structure, relationship rules,
and roles in relation to developmental and/or situational stressors (Anderson
and Gavazzi, 1990; Olson, Sprenkle, and Russell, 1979). Problem-solving abilities
in the family involve the ability of its members to gain resolution to both
instrumental and affective difficulties (Epstein, Bishop, and Baldwin, 1980).
Coping in the family concerns the degree to which members are able to respond
to calls for change by taking direct action, reframing a difficult situation
in ways that become more manageable, and/or controlling the amount of stress
and anxiety generated by the difficult situation (Boss, 1988; McCubbin and
Patterson, 1982).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Empirical Work on Family Flexibility</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>While few studies have focused on mother/father differences with regard
to flexibility, some researchers (McCubbin and Patterson, 1982) have suggested
that there is a greater chance for a family to have appropriate levels of
flexibility when there are two parents present. They suggest that having
two adults (regardless of gender) balances and regulates the stresses and
strains of daily living. Better flexibility, it is hypothesized, is created
when the two adults can call upon one another for suggestions, creative
solutions, and respite from the stress of parenting. However, we know nothing
of differences in the process that men and women use to ameliorate or attenuate
levels of familial flexibility.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Flexibility and well-being.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>At a more general
level, however, research has shown a strong and generally linear relationship
between variables associated with family flexibility and indicators of the
well-being of family members (Anderson and Gavazzi, 1990; Beavers and Voeller,
1983; Cluff, Hicks, and Madsen, 1994). For instance, studies have linked
lower levels of family adaptability to destructive parent-child interaction
(Garbarino, Sebes, and Schellenbach, 1985), the presence of a juvenile offender
(Druckman, 1979; Rodick, Henggeler, and Hanson, (1986), sexually abusive
behavior (Alexander and Lupfer, 1987), level of psychopathology (Lewis, Beaver,
Gossett, and Phillips, 1976) and chemical dependence (Freidman, Utada, and
Morrissey, 1987; Olson and Killorin, 1985).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Other studies have linked decreases in problem-solving abilities to
families seeking clinical help (Epstein, Baldwin, and Bishop, 1983; Fristad,
1989; Miller, Bishop, Epstein, and Keitner, 1985), families with a juvenile
offender (Vuchinich, Wood, and Vuchinich, 1994) as well as the level of risk
factors present (Byles, Byrne, and Offord, 1988; Kabakoff et al., 1990).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Additionally, a wide variety of interventions are based on increasing
the problem-solving abilities of families who are dealing with a range of
disorders (Patterson, Dishion, and Chamberlain, 1992; Kazdin, Siegel, and
Bass, 1992). Finally, studies have reported significant association between
family coping behaviors and physical health (Ross, Mirowsky, and Goldsteen,
1980), depression (Armsden et al., 1990; Arnold, 1990 Barrera and Garrison-Jones,
1992; Kandel and Davies, 1982; Puig-Antich et al., 1993), and a wide variety
of other outcome variables associated with individual and interpersonal
functioning (Olson et al., 1989; McCubbin et al., 1980; Perlin and Schooler,
1978).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Parental Support</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Definition.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Parental support, whether
conceptualized as general support, physical affection, acceptance, or
companionship, is a diverse category of behavior communicating warmth, affection,
rapport, and feelings of being valued (Barber and Thomas, 1986; Peterson
and Hanna, in press; Rohner, 1986; Stafford and Bayer, 1993). Parental support
is viewed as an expression of the "loving" dimension of relationships in
families. Such loving relationships are at least partly rooted in altruistic
motives that seem to foster such things as bonding, security, harmony,
protection, and opportunity for optimal human development in families (Burr,
Day, and Bahr, 1993). In the case of the parent-child subsystem, nurturant
or emotionally supportive relationships encourage the young to identify with
parents and incorporate their attitudes, values, and expectations.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Outcomes.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Consequently, parental support
often contributes to moral internalization and conformity to parent's
expectations (Hoffman, 1980; Peterson and Rollins, 1987; Stafford and Bayer,
1993). Other positive outcomes for children include autonomy and self-esteem.
Consequently, parental support seems to foster seemingly opposite developments
-- both responsiveness to or connectedness with parents as well as progress
toward autonomy or individuality. Parent-child relationships characterized
by considerable nurturance appear to provide a secure base (bonds of
connectedness) from which children and adolescents develop confidence to
explore outward and meet challenges that exist beyond family boundaries (autonomy
or individuality) (Bowlby, 1988: Peterson and Hann, in press; Peterson and
Leigh, 1990. Failure to receive sufficient levels of support, in turn, fosters
feelings of separation, expressions of hostility and aggression, diminished
self-esteem, as well as antisocial and risk behavior (Felson and Zielinski,
1989; Gecas and Schwalbe, 1986; Peterson and Rollins, 1987; Rohner, 1986;
Stafford and Bayer, 1993; Young, Miller, Norton, and Hill, 1995).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Empirical Work on Support</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Fathers' role in fostering the best outcomes for children has often
been portrayed as one of showing children (even at early ages) how to become
autonomous. In past research, the father was characterized as the one who
showed the child how to be independent in the world (Adelson and Doerhman,
1980; Shulman-Klein, 1993). Additionally, the traditional view of the father
is that he was summoned to, on occasion, reinforce stern rules, reaffirm
boundaries, and administer harsh discipline (Sterns, 1991). Some have suggested
that this type of figure-head, distant father who rules and demands had the
purpose of preparing the young person for the harsh world (Collins and Luebker,
1991).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Support and child-well being</B>. </FONT></I><FONT>Contrary to
previous research that highlighted the benefits of fathers' sternness, more
recent research suggests that fathers are more likely to produce positive
child outcomes when they contribute to youthful autonomy within the context
of relationships characterized by closeness, mutuality, and <I>support</I>
(Baltes and Silverberg, 1994; Baumrind, 1991; Grotevant and Condon, 1983;
Peterson, 1994; Quintana and Lapsley, 1990). That is, adolescents become
more self-directed when parents (especially fathers) promote a family environment
in which the teen can seek advice, experience validation, and realize a sense
of security.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In turn, an increased sense of autonomy and independence promotes other
desirable outcomes (e.g., higher academic achievement, better mental health,
and ease of transition in adult roles) in children as they mature and grow
into adulthood. Limited research about the role of the father (<I>cf
</I>Peterson and Day, in press) in this type of family process has greatly
hampered efforts to understand the complexity of the parent-child dyad.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>POLICY ISSUES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>For public policy to be effective in promoting responsible fathering,
it will need to be proactive, theoretically informed, and research based
(Furstenberg, 1988; Marsiglio, 1995b). Recent government policy concerning
men's family life has been dominated by punitive strategies to address domestic
violence and child support issues. While these strategies and issues remain
relevant to the prevailing social policy agenda, there is growing sentiment
that the search for better policy results will depend on research that considers
fathers' participation in family life in new ways.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Increasingly, policymakers and the general public acknowledge that
many fathers want to be more involved, and in some cases are more active
in their children's lives than previously thought. Even in those situations
where fathers are physically estranged from their children, many observers
believe that fathers can still be involved with their children in productive
ways and provide social capital to them. These observers also recognize how
important responsible fathering is for children's well-being. As a result,
individuals seem eager to support social policy that promotes the desirable
aspects of fathering, while at the same time minimizing the barriers that
limit fathers' options for making a positive contribution to their children's
well-being.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>At present, there is a paucity of information about men's positive
contribution to their families, and how family responsibilities may motivate
men to behave in the world of work and the larger society. The development
of social policy is therefore based on an incomplete understanding of how
men behave in response to policy stimuli. The stakes are high and social
policy regarding fatherhood may be much more important to areas such as crime,
education, economic development, welfare, and human capital development than
has been widely believed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>At least two historically novel trends related to fathers' experiences
have significant implications for public policy. One trend involves the
bi-polarization of fatherhood. This trend is evidenced by the simultaneous
growth in the proportion of fathers who are interested in playing a more
active role in their children's lives and the increasingly visible segment
of fathers who are disengaging (or are pushed) themselves from their paternal
responsibilities (Furstenberg, 1988). The other trend involves the growing
diversity and dynamic nature to men's life course patterns and paternal roles
as they find themselves in step, blended, cohabiting, and fictive families.
These family types require men (and others) to visualize and negotiate new
roles. To the extent that social policy is constructed through the lens of
the traditional nuclear family model, new forms of responsible fathering
by biological fathers or stepfathers are likely to be constrained.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>General Policy and Research Issues</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>In this section, we briefly explore some of the key features of social
policy and research germane to our conceptualization of responsible fatherhood
and positive paternal involvement. Unfortunately, our understanding of fathers
from a policy perspective is impeded because they are often considered in
a piecemeal manner, usually within the context of narrowly defined policy-related
questions.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Father's attachments to their children</I>.</FONT></B><FONT>
The first issue to consider is how biological fathers establish relationships
with their children. Fathers (biological and step) often develop attachments
to their children and become committed to them, at least in part, because
they have established a sexual relationship with their children's mother
(Furstenberg and Cherlin, 1991; Marsiglio, 1995c). As a result, when men's
romantic relationships with the mother is interrupted through a divorce or
informal breakup outside of marriage, men's relationships with their children
often deteriorate (Furstenberg and Cherlin, 1991). A key question, then,
is: How can fathers sustain a relationship with their children in spite of
their severed romantic ties to the mother of their children? Additionally,
are men capable of rekindling a relationship with their children after it
has waned? Can fathers establish relationships with their children even if
they failed to do so when their children were much younger?</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Divorce and coparental situations</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> As noted
above, the unraveling of a marriage often leads to attenuated relations between
fathers and their children. Intervention efforts to help fathers (and mothers)
deal with the emotional turmoil induced by separation and divorce processes
involving custody and visitation rights are warranted.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Despite some legal scholars' strong reservations about the feasibility
of professional mediation for partners undergoing separation and divorce
(Levy, 1993), it seems prudent to give serious consideration to public policies
that would provide couples with easy access to mediation during their divorce
negotiations as well as subsequently when they may need to address new family
situations (Arditti, 1991; Arditti and Kelly, 1994; Lamb and Sagi, 1983;
Thompson, 1994). Thompson convincingly argues that policymakers should move
away from "clean break" perceptions about divorce and instead encourage new
types of postdivorce relationships that are in children's best interests.
Voluntary or perhaps mandatory mediation classes for parents who are applying
for a divorce could enable parents to understand existing or potential
co-parenting issues more fully. Mediation sessions, and other pre/post divorce
intervention strategies, should encourage mothers to realize that promoting
access and positive interaction between fathers and children is a worthy
goal. In addition, these programs could help fathers understand the unique
features of their particular circumstances as nonresident, single, and perhaps
even stepfathers. In general, it is essential that a concerted effort be
made to ensure that fathers feel connected to their children and maintain
a feeling of obligation toward them--without relying exclusively on punitive
strategies. Evaluation research is therefore needed to assess the program
features of interventions, particularly ones with a two-parent focus, that
are most effective in promoting responsible fathering and children's
well-being.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Procreative responsibility and related
activities</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Another general issue focuses on how the
act of procreation and men's subsequent paternal involvement are related
to men's larger quest for meaning in their lives. The relationship between
men's family roles and their roles in other spheres of life (e.g., work,
school, religion, community) are reciprocal in many respects. One question
is: how do different forms of paternal involvement promote male responsibility
with respect to future fertility, labor force participation, and community
involvement? This question is particularly relevant to socioeconomically
disadvantaged men who are often marginalized from the paths to "success"
typically deemed appropriate by the mainstream public. Most of these men
are poorly educated and have limited job skills. Some are also shadowed by
a history of criminal behavior and other self-destructive patterns. What
do these men want out of life?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Ethnographic research hints that many desire the traditional formula
for success as a man -- a stable job, the sense of belonging to a family,
and a respected place in the community. Charles Ballard's innovative outreach
program for fathers, established in 1982 in Cleveland, provides additional
evidence that helping low-income fathers establish an emotional commitment
with their children can provide an enormous incentive for men to develop
their own human capital and community involvement (Levine and Pitt,
1995).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Perhaps the recent reforms to the AFDC program will enhance men's
commitment to family roles and spark an increase in disadvantaged men's economic
productivity and pro-social behavior. Research evaluating the effects of
welfare reform should therefore consider how these innovations affect men's
lives as fathers and in other spheres of life (e.g., education, work, community,
church).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Father/mother differences</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Do fathers differ
from mothers in their family behavior during the course of a child's life?
We have a better understanding of mothers because research has disproportionately
focused attention on their intense involvement with their children in the
early years of their lives. Fathers are often seen as mothers' helpers in
these early years, but do their contributions and involvement in children's
lives change as children grow up? Are there life course and developmental
processes that require different levels and types of father involvement and
support? Do these potential needs vary by the age and gender of children?
These questions require us to consider men as individuals rather than as
merely supports for mothers. We do not know what to expect from fathers in
general, and estranged fathers in particular, as they age with their children.
It may be the case that fathers play a poorly appreciated role as the adolescents
transition to productive, independent adults. If so, fathers' disengagement
early in a child's life must be evaluated in terms of its impact on children
that may manifest later in their lives. These issues loom large in questions
of custody and living arrangements subsequent to a divorce.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Family transitions and instability.</I></B> One consequence of
the instability of modern family life is that many fathers find themselves
disengaged from their families and searching for a new family experience.
Cherlin (1978) has suggested that we are in a cultural transition in which
the plethora of emerging family types and situations has created a phenomena
that could be described as an "incomplete institution." By this, he means
that the changes in our culture have occurred so rapidly that the new emerging
family forms have not had time to become "institutionalized." When family
transitions (e.g., marriage, engagement, and death of spouse) are
institutionalized, members are aware of norms to guide their behavior, ie.,
they have some sense of placement, the procedures to follow, and what to
expect. In the case of remarriage, families are left to invent their own
norms and transitional procedures. There are no well-defined "standards"
one can easily adapt to the new situation. Consequently, individual family
members must decide, with little guidance from cultural scripts, what the
new parent should be called, how distance should be regulated, who should
discipline and when, and how money should be transferred.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>While men in remarriage situations are generally older and perhaps
wiser as they prepare to establish a new family, their circumstances are
complicated because they often have family obligations from a previous family.
These obligations can collide with future fertility behavior in a subsequent
marriage, cause role confusion, and create a sense of detachment from one
or both families.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Also, if the new marriage or non-marital union involves a mother with
children from a previous relationship, then a stepfather may be forced to
negotiate a relationship with his stepchildren within a context marked by
the presence of a living, active biological father. A stepfather must ask:
How does forming a serious romantic union affect my new and pre-existing
paternal roles? How should I treat my stepchildren relative to my biological
ones? Where do my loyalties ultimately reside with respect to children?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In some ways, the law treats paternal involvement in remarriages as
a secondary commitment. Biological fathers, irrespective of their new marital
status and family circumstances, are expected to fulfill their child support
obligations to their nonresident children. This often causes conflict within
both families to the detriment of each. Also, the law is quite vague about
stepfathers' relationships with stepchildren. Indeed, social and legal
perceptions of stepfathers are still evolving and worthy of continued study,
especially in light of current demographic patterns that suggest that a large
percentage of children will at some point live with a stepfather figure.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Dual aspects of fatherhood</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> A final issue
involves the competing ways in which fathers may influence children's lives.
Fathers obviously may help protect children and teach them how to negotiate
the difficult experiences they will encounter as they make the transition
to adulthood. In stark contrast to these acceptable roles, fathers sometimes
present a danger to their families and trigger their children's self-destructive
behavior. Fathers have the potential to bring about real harm when they are
physically or mentally abusive, or when they induce children to leave home
before they are able to sustain themselves in a risky world.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>How can we fashion laws and public policy to encourage the protective
aspect of fathering while discouraging fathers' potentially harmful actions?
Attentive and caring fathers bring safety and stability to the home, and
communities filled with these types of fathers add an extra measure of security
to children's lives. Unfortunately, modern public policy has tended to discourage
men's participation in families which has lead to interpersonal instability
within households and dangerous communities where concentrations of households
without coresiding fathers are high. As we contemplate strategies for assisting
high risk families, no one knows for sure how to arrive at the optimal balance
between promoting fathers' positive participation in their children's lives
and restraining their negative influences. This represents an important area
where future research needs to inform policymaking.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>The Role of Public Policy, Law, and Business Practices</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>How does government constrain and/or promote responsible fatherhood
and positive paternal involvement? We highlight what we believe to be the
most important ways that public policy, law, and business practices currently
influence fathers' behavior, either positively or negatively. While social
initiatives are relevant to fathers' paternal involvement in a wide range
of situations, most deal with fathers who are either struggling because they
are poor, or their paternal rights and obligations have become a focal point
due to a divorce or a nonmarital birth. Obviously, many men are affected
by both sets of circumstances.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Welfare reform</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> As mentioned previously,
the provider role is a central construct in fathering. The structural
transformation of the U.S. economy away from manufacturing and extractive
industries to an information and service economy, coupled with the displacement
of jobs from inner city areas, has disproportionately diminished the ability
of economically disadvantaged fathers to provide for their families relative
to what mothers can provide, especially when mothers are aided by government
transfer programs. From a national policy perspective, many fathers have
been marginalized in their role as provider and this has coincided with a
marked increase in family instability. For example, government support programs
that require mothers to remain single in order to receive benefits offer
more attractive alternatives to the traditional notion of fathers as providers
when the eligible men are poorly educated and have few work skills. In addition,
administrative rules that require that fathers' child support be used to
reimburse the government for welfare support provided to the mother and her
children, and incentive programs that prod welfare mothers to target child
support enforcement actions at fathers, have sometimes discouraged fathers
from playing a more active role in their children's lives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The advent of welfare reform provides an excellent opportunity to
reconsider these policies and many states are experimenting with ways of
realigning government policies to be more father-friendly. For example, many
states have received permission to allow nonresident fathers of children
on welfare to enter the JOBS program which currently provides the mothers
of these children access to job training and education opportunities. By
making these services available to fathers, policymakers hope to improve
fathers' ability and desire to provide for their children. Some states (e.g.
Virginia and Maryland) have embedded specific fatherhood programs in either
child support and/or maternal health programs (Brenner, 1996).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>"Man in the house" rules have also been a prominent feature of public
housing and other types of welfare transfers. These rules have had the effect
of producing large concentrations of households in which fathers are "around"
but not living with their children. This may have the unfortunate effect
of undermining fathers' roles and preventing fathers from being responsible
fathers. Some states have started to abolish these policies. In Connecticut,
for example, parents can receive public assistance when both parents live
in the home. Moreover, the Hartford Housing Authority and the Child Support
Enforcement program have joined to create a program giving nonresident fathers
jobs related to the maintenance of a public housing project. These men also
receive special help in resolving child support related issues. Programs
such as these increase fathers' ability to contribute to their children's
lives and encourages their positive involvement with them. Such efforts are
expanding and must be evaluated rigorously with respect to all aspects of
fathers' involvement as well as children's and families' well-being (Brenner,
1996).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Complexities of divorced families</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> The debates
about fathers' degree of commitment and involvement with their children
post-divorce are volatile and complex (Griswold, 1993; Marsiglio, forthcoming).
One side of the debate focuses on the emotional crises many fathers experience
because of the formal and informal impediments they must deal with as they
struggle to maintain close relationships with their children after the
dissolution of a romantic relationship--often marriage. For many men, the
pain is real and long lasting. Despite the obvious anguish some fathers feel
in this area, harsh critics of some efforts to expand nonresident fathers'
rights present the other side of the debate in compelling fashion (Bertoia
and Drakich, 1995). Among other points, they suggest that many fathers are
less concerned about the day-to-day care of their children, the "moral labor"
of parenthood, than they are in controlling their former partners. These
critics warn against being duped by some men's "rhetoric of equality." As
is often the case in debates such as these, there is an element of "truth"
associated with each position. What must not be forgotten is that the processes
that feed into this perplexing situation occur within a society that remains
highly gendered.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Having alluded to the complexity of these issues, it is useful to point
out that research has recently revealed a surprising array of structural
barriers to father involvement in divorced families (Arditti and Kelly, 1994;
Thompson, 1994 p. 39, l 1). While it was previously thought that fathers
in such families remained uninvolved because they simply didn't care about
their children (deadbeat dads or runaway dads), research is accumulating
that suggests that this portrayal is vastly oversimplified. In many instances,
government policies (state and national) combine to deny fathers a more important
-- and more beneficial -- role in their children's lives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Joint custody.</I></B> One specific post-divorce policy challenge
is to deal with multi-household living environments that arise out of joint
legal or legal/physical custody arrangements. The advent of controversial
joint custody arrangements has prompted researchers to consider how these
arrangements affect post-divorce parenting; their research has produced mixed
results. Interestingly, Maccoby and Mnookin's (1992) research on California
families, and Seltzer's noncustodial fathers' income, did not find that joint
legal custody was related to child support, visitation, and child-related
decision-making (see also Fox and Kelly, 1995). However, Maccoby and Mnookin
did find that joint legal/physical custody was related to positive post-divorce
parenting. Some recent research also shows that joint legal custody appears
to be associated with more positive forms of paternal involvement such as
child support payments than with parental conflict (Seltzer, 1996). Braver's
(1994) research with families in Arizona has shown that when joint custody
is awarded father involvement is at very high levels. Moreover, the U.S.
Census Bureau has found that 97% of joint custody fathers pay child support,
as opposed to about a 2/3 rate for the population as a whole (US Bureau of
Census, 1991; Braver, 1996).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Fathers without custody.</I></B> While some men want and gain
either joint or sole custody, some observers contend that our current court
system mitigates toward disproportionate custody awards to mothers (Braver
et al., 1993). Braver and his colleagues found that fathers indicate strong
preferences (over 70%) for a joint legal custody award, and only a distinct
minority (11%) preferred the mother to have sole legal custody. However,
in 77% of these families the ultimate award was indeed for sole maternal
legal custody. Warshak (1988) has made compelling data-based arguments that
joint custody is in the best interests of children in many cases.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Why fathers so seldom receive the full custody or joint custody they
say they would prefer is a matter of some dispute. Weitzman (1984), for example,
reports that mothers believe that the fathers don't really <U>want</U> custody,
they just raise the possibility as a threat or a bargaining chip, and relinquish
their bid when they wring financial concessions. Others (Levy, 1990) argue
that attorneys discourage fathers from pursuing their preferences because
of a biased legal system, and usually only those with unassailable cases,
such as those involving the mother's severe mental illness, persist.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Father-child visitation</I>. </FONT></B><FONT>Some divorced fathers
without custody don't receive the legal right to visit their children and
this, of course, can be viewed as a severe structural barrier. In many cases,
there are clearly legitimate reasons for denying fathers access to their
children (e.g., history of abuse). Although fathers are seldom denied legal
visitation rights, greatly restricted rights are far more common. This is
particularly true when allegations of spouse or child abuse are made. One
difficult policy issue is deciding how government programs should balance
the safety of mothers and children when bona fide violence is present, while
at the same time not confusing an allegation with proof of abuse. While strong
incentives for spurious claims of abuse clearly exist, there are few
disincentives for such claims.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The most frequent visitation problem involves fathers who are legally
entitled to spend time with their children, but are either completely or
sporadically denied access by the mother. According to several studies (<I>cf
</I>Braver et al, 1993), this occurs in between 25% and 40% of divorced families.
There can be little dispute that there is minimal enforcement of visitation
rights, especially in comparison to the vast legal machinery that exists
to enforce non-payment of child support. We are not proposing that a federal
Office of Visitation Enforcement be created with a parallel budget. However,
the imbalance in efforts to protect visitation rights vs. the enforcement
of child support obligations no doubt conveys a message to fathers that the
"system" doesn't care about them nor about whether they are active in their
children's lives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Pilot research is currently underway to explore the feasibility and
effectiveness of visitation enforcement (Braver et al., 1993). The Dads For
Life Program currently being conducted and evaluated in the Phoenix area
attempts to teach divorced fathers how to be a positive force in their children's
lives irrespective of the constraints a divorce may impose on their family
relationships. Preliminary reports from participating fathers, mothers and
children suggest the program is having profound and apparently long-lasting
benefits. Perhaps the best remedy is educating mothers on how healthy
father-child relationships can benefit children -- as well as the mother
herself.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Mothers as gatekeepers.</I></B> As the previous discussion suggests,
mothers often serve as gatekeepers in divorced families (and in informal
unions leading to nonmarital births). This can hamper fathers' motivation
to remain involved. In the most definitive research, using a representative
sample, and a longitudinal design, Braver et al. (1993) found that the factor
best predicting fathers' long term involvement was the fathers' feeling
"parentally enfranchised." Many fathers felt that issues related to their
divorce, especially concerns about their children, were out of their control.
When divorced fathers felt they shared control with the mother over child
rearing issues they were less likely to feel alienated. When fathers did
not feel they shared parental control, they felt as if their children were
not theirs anymore. Many reported that they felt the society, the legal system,
and their ex-wives had conspired to fracture their connection with their
children while expecting them to fulfill their financial obligations as
fathers.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Geographic relocation.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>A barrier of another
kind is when one divorced parent moves to another geographic area. Clearly,
if the child stays with the mother, fathers can not retain the same day-to-day
involvement that is possible when both parents remain in the same location.
This type of relocation is also associated with a significant decrease in
child support payments and enforcement is far more difficult. This hotly
debated area finds feminists arguing that no restrictions should be placed
on mothers' (or fathers') mobility, while opponents argue that custodial
parents who want to relocate and take their child should be forced to demonstrate
that such a move is necessary, for either health or employment reasons.
Additional research on the consequences of relocation on all involved parties
is needed to inform policy in this area.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Child support enforcement</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Child support
enforcement is related to circumstances stemming from either divorce or a
nonmarital birth. It also is a difficult public policy area because it stresses
a strict financial discipline on nonresident parents who are usually
fathers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>An important component of child support enforcement is paternity
establishment. States are using a variety of methods to establish paternity
in cases of nonmarital births as soon after the birth as possible. While
this is done to maximize the ability of the state to enforce child support
claims against the father, this procedure may encourage fathers to develop
a stronger commitment to their children. To the extent this objective is
achieved, fathers may be more involved in their children's lives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>One of the key issues associated with child support enforcement policy
is the extent to which the resources of the program will be used to mediate
conflicts arising over visitation. At least one state, Utah, will suspend
a mother's drivers license if she refuses to cooperate in allowing visitation
access. Policymakers face a major challenge in finding an optimal child support
enforcement policy that maximizes the financial commitment of nonresident
fathers while ensuring that fathers have ample opportunity to spend quality
time with their children.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Experience with attempts to enforce child support obligations has revealed
that fathers' visitation patterns are related to child support payment, and
greater contact may be related to better outcomes for children (Zill and
Nord, 1996; Argys, 1996). While researchers are uncertain about the complex
causal direction of these statistical associations, the apparent relationship
between father-child contact and child support payments should serve as an
incentive for researchers to examine these issues more carefully.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Health insurance</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Health insurance for children
is a major consideration for poor families. The advent of a service economy
has meant that many fathers must work more than one job, many of which are
without health insurance benefits. Medicaid, like AFDC welfare, has posed
problems for fathers in the past because these programs were formally linked.
Medicaid will not pay for any Prepared Childbirth training for fathers and
this may hinder the bonding between fathers, mothers, and children in poor
families which are already often very fragile. The beginning of welfare reform
offers an opportunity to consider ways in which health insurance can be provided
to poor families without discouraging fathers from co-residing with their
children and/or being responsible fathers (Staff, 1995).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Early childhood education programs.</I></B> Early childhood education
programs including developmental day care, Head start, and preschool programs
have largely ignored how fathers might be connected to their children in
these formative years. While these early childhood programs were initially
developed to assist mothers, ongoing experiments such as Early Head Start
are examining ways to connect fathers to their children (Levine, Murphy,
and Wilson, 1993).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Criminal justice system.</I></B> Officials within the criminal
justice system have taken notice that many prisoners are fathers and that
there is a substantial intergenerational transmission of experience about
the subculture of crime. This has stimulated a new awareness that intervention
programs that help imprisoned fathers be better fathers might break the
intergenerational transmission of institutionalization. Some states (e.g.,
Louisiana and California) are experimenting with intervention programs in
the juvenile justice system and states such as California, Illinois, Arkansas,
Delaware, and New Jersey are doing the same in adult corrections facilities
(Staff, 1997). Policymakers are thus faced with the prospects of figuring
out innovative ways of promoting styles of fathering that will break the
intergenerational transmission of anti-social behavior.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Workplace barriers</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> The debate about how
to balance work and family roles has generally focused on women, because
women have traditionally taken the primary responsibility for child rearing
while participating in the labor market as secondary earners; men have been
considered the family breadwinner. Debates in recent years, however, have
begun to incorporate discussions about the "new" father who is expected to
be more involved with children (Hyde et al., 1993). For these reasons, a
discussion about workplace barriers to participation in family life is important
for both men and women.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Parental leave</I>. </FONT></B><FONT>In 1993 President Clinton
signed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) that allowed parents to take
up to six weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or adopted child or
another family member who is sick. The federal law further restricted these
benefits to those working in establishments with 50 or more employees, employed
for a full year, and working at least 1,250 hours during the year prior to
taking the leave. Before the passage of FMLA, 11 states had similar family
leave policies (Klerman and Liebowitz, 1997).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Paid parental leave in the U.S. is fairly rare. In 1993 only 3% of
medium and large establishments and 1% of small establishments offered parental
leave (Blau, Ferber, and Winkler, forthcoming). Other countries have much
more generous family leave provisions. For example, parents in Sweden can
take up to a total of 15 months in paid leave to be shared between the mother
and father.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Despite the availability of these benefits, fathers are much less likely
to take parental leave, or they take leave for much shorter durations than
do mothers. In the U.S. it has been estimated that fathers take about five
days of leave when their child is born. The good news is that 91% of fathers
took at least some leave (Hyde, Essex, and Horton, 1993). When fathers take
time off from work, they are much more likely to use paid vacation or sick
leave than parental leave which is most often unpaid.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The availability of parental leave in the U.S. is a fairly recent
phenomenon. Comparisons with studies of parental leave in Sweden provide
us with what is likely to be a "upper bound" estimate of how U.S.
fathers;'paternal leave tendencies might change over time. Haas and Hwang
(1995) report that in 1974, the first year that parental leave was available,
only 3% of Swedish fathers took parental leave. Over time that number increased
gradually, and by 1994 about one-half of fathers took parental leave. Even
in Sweden, however, fathers of children born in 1989 took far fewer days
of leave than mothers (43 vs. 60) (Haas, 1993). Two reasons for this difference
are 1) the importance and prevalence of breast feeding during the first year
of a child's life, and 2) the fact that men generally earn more than women.
Thus, unless income replacement is 100%, the income loss to the family is
greater when men take a leave and is likely to act as a disincentive for
fathers to take leave at the same rate as do mothers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Surveys of workers and employers also find that fathers are concerned
that taking parental leave will reduce their chances for promotions and
raises<B> </B>(Hyde, Essex, and Horton, 1993). Employers state that those
fears may be justified. Although women of child-bearing age have traditionally
faced these same prejudices, some employers are beginning to make allowances
for family responsibilities because so many women are now in the labor force.
The idea of men taking paternal leave, on the other hand, is still largely
viewed as unacceptable in the corporate culture (Hass and Hwang, 1993).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Jobs.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>The structure of jobs and workplace
policies may facilitate or hinder working parents' ability to spend time
with their children. The key to parental care when both parents work is flexible
hours, including flextime, irregular work schedules, part-time employment,
job sharing, and home based work. In addition, the parental leave policies
mentioned above allow a parent to be at home full time during critical periods
in a child's life without the fear of losing a job or losing seniority in
that job.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT><I>Flexible hours</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> One measure of co-parenting
fathers' involvement with their children is the frequency that they provide
child care while the mother works. For married couples with children under
age 15, it has been estimated that about 13% of fathers serve as the primary
child care provider when the mother works outside the home (O'Connell, 1993).
Most of these fathers are employed. Studies have found that fathers are more
likely to provide this child care if 1) the mother works part-time or a
non-standard shift or 2) the father works part-time or a non-standard shift
(Casper and McConnell, 1996; Averett, Gennetian and Peters, 1997). Part-time
or non-standard shift work allows parents to work at different times from
each other and for each parent to provide some care while the other works.
Presser (1995) estimates that 54% of men and 56% of women work a fixed day
schedule, Monday through Friday only. Presser has also found that women are
more likely to respond to family responsibilities by choosing non-standard
work schedules. Specifically, 27% percent of women who had children under
age 14 reported better child care as the reason for working a non-standard
shift compared to almost 5% of men (Presser, 1995).</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Part-time work.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Part-time work is also more
prevalent for women than for men. In 1995, 34% of women, but only 18% of
men worked part-time (Blau, Ferber, and Winkler, forthcoming). Although part-time
work has the advantage of allowing parents to share child care and spend
more time with the family, it also has costs in the form of lower earnings,
lower pay per hour, fewer opportunities for promotion and fewer benefits
such as health care and retirement savings plans.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>CONSTRUCTS USED IN DATA COLLECTION</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Another way we can begin to understand father involvement is to examine
how survey researchers have measured this construct in large scale data sets
such as the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID), National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY),
High School and Beyond (HSB), the National Survey of Children (NSC), and
the forthcoming Adolescent Health Survey (Add Health) from the University
of North Carolina Population Center. In this section of the report, we review
what we found when we canvassed these and other data sets and categorized
the types of measures that were included. The collection of massive data
sets is an obviously expensive and time consuming undertaking. Therefore,
the constructs that survive that scrutiny are deemed essential to the data
collection effort. By performing an audit on some of these larger data sets
we are able to determine how fatherhood issues have been measured and, therefore,
what many researchers deem significant. This exercise contributes to the
conversation about what information still needs to be collected about father
involvement in large-scale data sets, most of which are longitudinal in
nature.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Our search was guided by the categories, topics, and domains suggested
earlier in this report where we discussed conceptualizations of father
involvement. At the most basic level, we appraised each data set with regard
to general father presence/absence issues. Next, in each of the 14 data sets,
we looked for any of Palkovitz's (1997) suggested categories of involvement.
Table 1 is a distillation of what was found in the data sets. Further, Tables
4 through 15 give examples drawn from particular data sets of how questions
were asked in reference to an involvement category. (see Appendix J)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT><B><I>Data Sets.</I></B> We chose data sets based on two criteria.
First, we selected those which featured family-related variables (e.g., Add
Health, NSFH, NSC). Second, we chose data sets if they represented an area
of study for which information about fathers would seemingly be important
(e.g., Baltimore Study of Unplanned Teen Pregnancy, High School and Beyond).
This selection process is in no way meant to be exhaustive or even representative
of secondary data sets. Instead, our purpose is to demonstrate the kind of
father-related research variables that have been used to date.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT><B>Findings.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>We provide a short analysis of
what we found when we examined father measures. First, as an historical note,
recent data sets that have been collected (or are being collected, e.g.,
Add Health, PSID Supplement, NSFH II ) have many more items that can be construed
as fitting into the father involvement categories. Surprisingly, some of
the more widely used data sets such as the NLSY, have very few father related
variables. The HSB, for example, has practically nothing a researcher can
use to consider the effect of differing levels of father involvement on school
performance. Nevertheless, we conclude that many researchers are beginning
to attend to father involvement issues. Of particular note is the recent
extensive work done on the PSID. In the past, this survey has focused heavily
on income dynamics as its name suggests. New data are being collected (1997)
using this supplement and the resulting information should provide a wealth
of opportunities to research father involvement issues.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Also, in the recent panel wave of the NSFH, much more attention was
paid to involvement categories like <I>activities, emotional support, and
monitoring.</I> In the new Add Health Survey, a specific effort has been
made to assess quality and substance of communication between fathers and
teen children. Additionally, these researchers have paid careful attention
to other father involvement variables like teaching, monitoring, availability,
and levels of affection. Unlike several of the other data sets, the Add Health
also examines in more detail the types of shared activities that fathers
and children experience. Our guess is that this data set will be used extensively
by researchers interested in father involvement issues.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We recognize that organizers of large data sets often include measures
for the parents who are in or out of the immediate environment. Some go to
great lengths to assess where that parent is and what his/her contact is
with the family. However, the usual pattern is to ascertain a general dichotomous
reading of family structure (i.e., is the father there or not) and then to
let his absence stand as a token marker variable. Again, this deficit model
of research suggests a simple two-variable linear connection that father
absence leads to poorer family well-being.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>None of the data sets began with the notion of examining a father
involvement construct central to ongoing family processes. However, there
are some data sets (e.g., Add Health, NSFH, PSID, and NSC) that have a few
scattered family process variables in them. These usually reflect an effort
to collect some information about monitoring, communication, or affection.
Family process variables such as flexibility and distance regulation have
not been assessed in these types of data collection efforts. Additionally,
very few of the data sets attempt to collect information from multiple
respondents within the family. Therefore, even when a family process measure
happens to be included, it is usually appraised from only one person's
perspective. As such, the latent family process constructs remain poorly
measured and under-researched.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The new supplement to the PSID offers researchers a better look at
fatherhood issues by using a diary system. The respondents are given a time
diary in which they are to record time use and some interactions with family
members. One challenge facing large data collection efforts is how to move
away from having data about attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions that are
reported from one respondent. By using video recordings, time diaries, and
other observational techniques, researchers can begin to respond to the common
critique that assessing marker-like variables from one person's perception
tells very little about the inner dynamics of a family.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We also learn from a perusal of these data sets that only one or two
items are typically used to measure a construct. For example, several data
sets have some measure of monitoring. Often, however, there is only one item
that could be considered a monitoring question. The richness and texture
of that construct is therefore compromised. It is understandable that they
are limited in this way given the expensive nature of data collection and
that these collection efforts were not directly targeting fatherhood
issues.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The most common categories of questions that have been covered (at
least superficially) in this sampling of surveys are questions about teaching,
monitoring, caregiving, availability, and affection. Also, several of the
surveys focused on the negative involvement aspects of fathering and proposed
some measure of conflict and harsh punishment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We hasten to add, however, that in some cases such as measures of
communication, the smattering of questions asked ranges from in-depth exchanges
about sexual issues to frequency of letters received from fathers during
the year. This leads to an important lesson we can gain from this exercise.
There is apparently very little consensus on how these constructs are defined
and operationalized from one researcher to next. The secondary data researcher
who employs these data sets must make do with the items that were chosen.
One outcome of this rather chaotic approach is that it is practically impossible
for researchers to compare findings across data sets. Only on rare occasions
(such as measures of depression) is there a consensus on how to measure an
idea.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>The least common father involvement categories that were measured were
sharing interest, protection, emotional support, child maintenance, and other
family processes. Virtually no studies have ventured into the realm of
ritualization, distance regulation, and flexibility for example. Surprisingly,
very few ask questions about protection which is a fathering stereotype that
is almost universal. Also, it is surprising that few have asked fathers about
what activities they wish to or do share with their children (NSFH is one
exception on the latter point). This is particularly odd given that many
researchers have characterized fathers as being notably interested in play
activities.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In sum, recent data collection organizers (e.g., Add Health, PSID,
NSFH) are to be applauded for including survey questions that help us better
understand father involvement as a complex and intricate construct. They
should also be recognized for moving away from the sterile environment of
presence/absence questions. However, much work is yet needed. As more conceptual
work proceeds and researchers/policymakers begin to agree on central constructs,
we will need to wrestle with designing and using measures that provide the
broadest picture of father involvement. Ideally, these measures should also
appeal to a research community with diverse disciplinary interests.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Summary and Applications</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>We began this report by discussing our preference for using the term
"social fatherhood" to underscore our perspective on conceptualizing fatherhood
issues. Thus, we are not merely interested in men who are biological progenitors,
although they clearly represent the most important group of men we consider.
Being a social father involves a diverse set of ways "fathers" can be involved
in their children's lives that may or may not be tied to biological
paternity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>An understanding of several general issues is essential as researchers
and policymakers approach the task of conceptualizing social fatherhood and
paternal involvement. Our broad conceptualization of these issues is informed
by four overarching themes:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT>First, one needs to consider <I>family structure</I> issues in light
    of recent sociodemographic changes in family composition.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Next, by attending to <I>cultural diversity</I> we direct our attention
    to divergent ethnic and cultural patterns that shape fathers' parenting
    experiences.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><I>Gender</I>, as a primary organizing principle of social life, is
    an important consideration at various levels when examining men's and women's
    social parenting roles. Gender issues continue to shape the social context
    for parenting as well as how males and females view and experience their
    parenting roles. In particular, gendered parenting exists to the extent that
    parents' involvement in their children's lives is affected by their use of
    different parenting paradigms which may include potentially different skills,
    interests, motivations, strategies, and resources.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>The <I>developmental trajectories</I> perspective reminds us that fathers,
    mothers, and children have different needs, goals, and interests which they
    express at various points throughout their overlapping life courses.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Domains of fathering.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Drawing on the thematic
    framework noted above, we emphasize an inclusive approach to paternal involvement
    that emphasizes the value of considering cognitive, affective, and behavioral
    ways that fathers can be involved with their children. Thus, our
    conceptualization of paternal involvement incorporates far more than simply
    fathers' hands-on parenting experiences.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Resources.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>A particularly important feature
    of our definition of social father is an assessment of what resources he
    shares with the assembled family. This is not to imply that mothers are somehow
    deficient or cannot bring similar resources to the family. However, it is
    precarious to assume that resource contributions will necessarily be equal
    in amount or type. We suggest that in most cases there will be differences
    in resources (for better or worse) and that research needs to attend to resource
    type, amount shared, and mechanisms for transference. To understand the
    conceptualization of social father it is necessary to delineate these resources
    <I>vis a vis</I> the mother and others who may be contributing. From Coleman
    (1992) we learn that the resources fathers provide for their children
    include:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Human capital</I></B> (e.g., skills, knowledge, and traits that
    foster achievement in U.S. society)</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Financial capital</I></B> (e.g., money, goods, and experiences
    purchased with income)</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Social capital</I></B> (e.g., family and community relations
    that benefit children's cognitive and social development)</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>In this report, we focus primarily on aspects of fathers' economic
    provider role and the contributions of social capital as expressed through
    coparental and father-child relationships. More research on how all three
    types of capital influence childrens' well-being is essential.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Generativity.</I></B> We also suggest that conceptualizations
    of social fatherhood should be sensitive to the <I>generative fathering</I>
    perspective. Researchers are likely to make better contributions to this
    literature when they view fathering as an emergent process that accentuates
    men's personal growth vis-a-vis their children's well-being. In contrast,
    a deficit model suggests that the topic of fathering be approached from the
    position of what fathers do not do or what happens when they are absent.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Responsible fathering.</I></B> A conceptualization of responsible
    fathering needs to recognize men <I>holistically as procreative beings</I>
    (Marsiglio, forthcoming). We stress the importance of recognizing the continuity
    of men's roles beginning with their procreative decision-making choices prior
    to conception, moving on to the pregnancy process itself, and culminating
    in fathers' involvement with their children. We therefore follow Levine and
    Pitt's (1995) lead who propose that the "responsible man" does not participate
    in the conception process until he is prepared emotionally and financially
    to support his child, establishes legal paternity when a child is conceived,
    shares in the continued emotional and physical care of his child, and shares
    in the continuing financial support of his child, from pregnancy onwards.
    Policies and/or research agendas about fathers in families will be better
    served when the above starting points are recognized and highlighted.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Paternal involvement.</I></B> Fathers' involvement with their
    children includes a diverse array of potentially overlapping dimensions.
    Furthermore, vast individual and subcultural differences exist among persons'
    definitions and willingness/ability to invest in these dimensions. Men committed
    to being "good fathers" may perform quite differently, with the same performances
    sometimes being viewed as successful or unsuccessful depending on the implicit
    definitions held by those making the evaluations. A primary purpose of this
    report is to further develop an understanding of the factors that lead to
    positive forms of fathers' involvement with their children. Some of the essential
    elements of paternal involvement include:</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Nurturing and caregiving</B>:</FONT></I><FONT> This is an often
    recognized aspect of fatherhood but there is disagreement about the importance
    of this dimension. Its relevance and effectiveness may vary depending on
    the age and gender of the children.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Moral and ethical guidance</I></B>: While this aspect of fatherhood
    is often viewed as central to what fathers should do for their children,
    in reality, most such guidance or socialization within the family is performed
    by mothers. The influence of paternal guidance may be indirectly mediated
    by children's identification with and imitation of their fathers, regardless
    of fathers' own efforts.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Emotional, practical, and psychosocial support of female
    partners</I></B> (i.e., mothers or stepmothers of men's children): This refers
    to aspects of social capital derived from coparental relations. That is,
    when the relationship is stronger the transmission of social capital will
    be more likely to occur.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Economic provisioning or breadwinning</I></B>: This dimension
    of fatherhood is probably viewed by many as the central aspect to
    fatherhood.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Time use.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>A large number of studies have
    examined how much time fathers spend with their children and what sorts of
    activities occupy that time. While there are numerous problems with father/child
    time use data, the extant research in this area suggests the following:</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Quantifying</B> </FONT></I><FONT>the time involved is difficult.
    The anxiety, worry, and contingency planning that comprise parental
    responsibility often occur when the parent is ostensibly doing something
    else.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Problems of <B><I>measurement inconsistency</I></B> remain. When
    researchers use Lamb et al.'s (1987) three-fold typology of involvement (i.e.,
    engagement, accessability, and responsibility) they usually do so retrospectively
    using results of independent studies conducted years earlier which were never
    collected with those ideas in mind.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Fathers do not appear to be spending appreciably more <B><I>time
    interacting</I></B> with their children when mothers are employed; rather
    the proportions increase because mothers do less interacting (because they
    are working outside the home more). Thus, fathers are proportionately more
    involved when mothers are employed, even though the depth of their involvement
    in absolute terms, does not change to any meaningful extent.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Maternal employment</I></B> has probably led to changes in the
    types of activities in which fathers engage and new studies may show increases
    in the extent of paternal responsibility.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Time diary studies have shown that the amount of time fathers spend
    with their children is associated with <I><B>socioeconomic class</B> </I>(lower
    class fathers tend to spend more time with their children), age (fathers
    spend more time with younger than with older children), and gender (fathers
    spend more time with boys than with girls).</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT>New work on conceptualizing paternal involvement.</FONT></B>
    <P>
    <FONT>Researchers have recently devoted more attention to developing new
    ways of<I> conceptualizing and measuring involvement.</I> Palkovitz (1997)
    provides an expanded view of paternal involvement from a generative fathering
    perspective.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>His conceptualization expands Lamb's earlier typology and he elaborates
    on a diverse set of ways fathers can be involved with their children, including
    economic provisioning. In addition to highlighting the behavioral domain
    of paternal involvement, this framework accentuates the cognitive (e.g.,
    planning) and affective domains as well. Palkovitz also suggests that a complete
    conceptualization of paternal involvement needs to take into account a series
    of co-occurring continua (time invested, observability, salience, degree
    of involvement, directness, proximity, appropriateness).</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Economic provider.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>In this report, we focus
    specific attention on fathers' role of economic provider because it is
    fundamental to most persons' definition of fatherhood, it is a critical form
    of paternal involvement, and it is associated with important public policy
    issues. Provisioning is meant to include the supplying of money for food,
    clothing, shelter and other consumption items. The following points were
    made with regard to provisioning behavior:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Economic resources matter because <I>economic instability</I> (e.g.,
    unstable work, income loss, etc.) can lead to marital conflict which itself
    has negative consequences for children.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Fathers who provide more money to the family often do so at the <I>cost
    of spending less time</I> with their families.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Evidence suggests that mothers spend money in ways that are more <I>child
    friendly</I> than do fathers.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Many nonresident fathers do not pay <I>formal child support</I>. In
    one recent study it was reported that about half of the nonresident fathers
    (51%) who owed child support paid the full amount; 24% paid a partial amount,
    and the remaining 25% paid nothing.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>A relatively new concept in the provisioning literature suggests that
    nonresident fathers may provide heretofore unreported support in the form
    of <I>informal monetary or non-monetary contributions</I> to the mother.
    Indeed, one study found that fathers assumed more financial responsibility
    for their children informally than through the formal child support
    system.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Generally, studies find that child support has positive effects on
    children's <I>cognitive achievement and educational attainment</I> that cannot
    be accounted for solely by the financial contribution of child support. This
    suggests that when fathers contribute and transfer capital to their children
    the act of transference is more powerful than when the same resources come
    from non-paternal sources.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Very little is known about the economic contributions to the household
    and to children of <I>stepfathers or male partners in cohabiting
    relationships</I>.</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT><I>Motivation</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> The motivations that bear on
    a man's decision to be a father and to fulfill the associated roles in a
    responsible way appear to be shaped by cultural images of fatherhood represented
    in the media and other outlets, as well as men's socio-cultural background,
    their current social circumstances, and their earlier experiences, particularly
    the behavior of their own parents. Some primary motivations that were mentioned
    were 1) the experience of caring for and raising children, 2) an opportunity
    to strengthen their bond with their romantic partners, 3) to ensure that
    they are not lonely or financially vulnerable in their later years of life,
    and 4) to feel more connected to their extended family and/or friends. We
    also suggested that there is a growing thread of research in which
    sociobiologists emphasize that both men and women strive to maximize the
    representation of their genes in future generations. Other motivations to
    parent were suggested as follows:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>The <I>generativity</I> theme contends that some fathers are motivated
    to be involved with their children because such involvement is related to
    healthy adult development.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Some men are motivated by <I>recollections</I> of the fathering men
    experienced as children as well as their interpretation of other men's fathering
    behaviors in specific social situations.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Some are motivated by a desire to seek or <I>enhance a level of
    maturity</I> and receive a confirmation of social status.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>A <I>commitment model </I>highlights the notion that identities are
    negotiated within the context of structured role relationships. As such,
    a key feature of motivation is that fathers' commitment to being a particular
    type of man, partner, and father may affect their desire to be involved with
    their children in particular ways.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>We summarized our review of paternal involvement by noting that individual,
    interactional, and macro/meso level factors combine to shape fathers' motivations
    and opportunities to express themselves as fathers toward their children
    in particular ways.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>The role of <I>motivation</I> in the search for a conceptualization
    of men's parenting role is complex and rich with research opportunity. Very
    little is known about why men choose to parent and how those choices vary
    by age, ethnic, cultural, or class background. Further, we know little about
    why some men are more motivated than others to magnify particular ways of
    involving themselves in their children's lives.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Family process.</I></B> Family process informs us about how family
    members think, feel, and act toward each other and is measured by assessing
    the shared relationships of multiple family members. This level of analysis
    is interactional and the focus is the family group instead of individual
    or macro-levels. One application that helps us understand how the quality
    of family process operates can be found in the work of Coleman. He posited
    that the level of social capital available by the father that <I>could</I>
    be transmitted to the child can only be transferred when the quality of the
    dyadic relationships are of higher capacity. Such ideas have prodded family
    researchers to consider the inner dynamics of families and their impact on
    children's well-being.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>There are several important family process constructs that have recently
    emerged as seminal descriptors of those inner dynamics, including <I>distance
    regulation, flexibility, support, supervision/ monitoring, affection,
    communication, and ritualization.</I> We focused on three of these constructs
    to illustrate how parent interaction can facilitate children's well-being.
    A main point of that discussion was that very little of the family process
    research has explored how the parent's gender may affect these processes.
    Further, there is evidence to suggest that when father's and mother's
    contribution to the family interactional process is examined separately the
    differences predict in discrete ways, and tell us more about family outcomes
    than when research only examines the process from one parent's point of view
    or combines the perspectives.</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT><I>Distance regulation</I>.</FONT></B><FONT> Distance regulation
    contains two primary dimensions: tolerance for individuality and the parent's
    tolerance for intimacy.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Effective distance regulation influences the child's ability to make
    a successful and effective transition to a post-adolescent status. Families
    with distance regulation problems (for fathers and mothers) result in adolescent
    samples displaying a variety of pathological indicators, including depressive
    disorders, disruptive behavior and obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating
    disorders, and aggressive and non-aggressive attention deficit hyperactivity
    disorders. These patterns are also found among more outpatient-oriented samples
    deemed "at risk" of developing psychopathological conditions. Also, the distance
    regulation style of the father may have a greater impact on pre-teen and
    teenage children than the mother's style. It has also been found that the
    influence of the father's distance regulation behaviors is a good predictor
    of adolescent outcomes such as behavior problems and ease of on-time
    developmental transitions.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT><B><I>Flexibility</I></B> is defined as the degree to which members
    are able to change the power structure, relationship rules, and roles in
    relation to developmental and/or situational stressors. Research on flexibility
    and children's well-being has shown that better levels of flexibility exist
    when there are two parents present. Better flexibility is linked to lower
    levels of destructive parent-child interaction, the absence of a juvenile
    offender in the home, lower reports of sexually abusive behavior, decreased
    levels of psychopathology, and less chemical dependence.</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT><I>Parental Support</I> </FONT></B><FONT>is defined as general support,
    physical affection, acceptance, or companionship, and includes the communication
    of warmth, affection, rapport, and feelings of being valued. Parental support
    is viewed as an expression of the "loving" dimension of relationships in
    families. Research shows that parental support often contributes to moral
    internalization and conformity to parent's expectations, autonomy and
    self-esteem, a sense of connectedness, and if absent may lead to feelings
    of separation, expressions of hostility and aggression, diminished self-esteem,
    as well as antisocial and risk behavior. As was mentioned above, while little
    research has focused on fathers' role in promoting support, research has
    shown that adolescents become more self-directed when parents (especially
    fathers) promote a family environment in which the teen can seek advice,
    experience validation, and realize a sense of security. Individual autonomy
    can best be fostered through mutuality and support.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Future research clearly needs to spotlight fathers' roles in family
    processes. Researchers are beginning to move away from the assumption that
    men's and women's contribution to family dynamics is similar with regard
    to such topics as distance regulation and/or support. However, we know very
    little about how each gender (within different family structure types or
    cultures) approaches these strategic interactional tasks.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Policy issues.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>For public policy to be effective
    in promoting responsible fathering, it will need to be proactive, theoretically
    informed, and research based. Past policy directives with regard to fathering
    have primarily focused on punishing and/or coercing fathers when they do
    not support their families or when they are violent. It is critical that
    family policy move beyond that two-pronged focus and begin to consider how
    to encourage fathers' positive participation in family life.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>A new assumption is awaking our interest in this arena. That is, we
    are learning that many fathers want to be responsible and involved. However,
    unintended barriers created by well-meaning policies, cultural stereotypes,
    and work place factors have limited the ability and motivation of men to
    take a more proactive posture toward their family commitments. Furthermore,
    it is becoming clear that encouraging fathers to attend to these commitments
    (especially where children's welfare is concerned) has high payoff in the
    long and short term. When families are stronger (accomplished in part through
    better and more positive father involvement) they place a smaller financial
    burden on local, state, and federal governments. Two trends related to fathers'
    experiences are particularly significant for public policy:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>First, while the proportion of fathers who are interested in playing
    a more active role in their children's lives has been increasing, the proportion
    of fathers who are disengaging (or are pushed) themselves from their paternal
    responsibilities has also been rising (Furstenberg, 1988).</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Second, there is an evolving diversity and dynamic nature to men's
    life course patterns and paternal roles as they find themselves in step,
    blended, cohabiting, and fictive families. The increased frequency of these
    diverse family types require men (and others) to visualize and negotiate
    new roles. To the extent that social policy is constructed through the lens
    of the traditional nuclear family model, new forms of responsible fathering
    by biological fathers or stepfathers are likely to be constrained.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>As the above trends are considered, policymakers need to remember that
    the decisions about parenting are usually made within the context of an adult
    dyadic relationship (i.e., husband and wife). These trends have drawn observers'
    attention to obvious questions: How can fathers develop and sustain a
    relationship with their children in spite of their severed romantic ties
    to the mother of their children? Additionally, are men capable of rekindling
    a relationship with their children after it has waned? Can fathers establish
    relationships with their children even if they failed to do so when their
    children were much younger?</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>During divorce processes.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>With regard to
    the process of divorce, we suggested that continued positive father interaction
    is important to more favorable outcomes for children. Consequently, we suggested
    that:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Policymakers should give greater attention to policies that would provide
    couples with easy access to mediation during their divorce negotiations as
    well as subsequently when they may need to address new family
    situations.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Policymakers should move away from "clean break" perceptions about
    divorce and instead encourage new types of postdivorce relationships that
    are in children's best interests.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Mediation classes for parents who are applying for a divorce could
    enable parents to understand existing or potential coparenting issues more
    fully.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Mediation sessions, and other pre/post divorce intervention strategies,
    should encourage mothers to realize that promoting access and positive
    interaction between fathers and children is a worthy goal.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Programs could help fathers understand the unique features of their
    particular circumstances as nonresident, single, and perhaps even
    stepfathers.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Evaluation research is needed to assess the program features of divorce
    interventions, particularly ones with a two-parent focus, that are most effective
    in promoting responsible fathering and children's well-being following
    dissolution.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Procreative responsibility.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>With regard
    to procreative responsibility, researchers and policymakers need to discover
    how different forms of paternal involvement, particularly fathers' involvement
    in their children's lives, promote male responsibility with respect to future
    fertility, labor force participation, and community involvement. This question
    is particularly relevant to men who are often marginalized from the typical
    paths to "success."</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Mother/father difference.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Another policy
    issue centers on father/mother differences. Do fathers differ from mothers
    in their family behavior during the course of a child's life? The implication
    is that fathers are often seen as mothers' helpers in the child's early years,
    but do their contributions and involvement in children's lives change as
    children grow up? Are there life course and developmental processes that
    require different levels and types of father involvement and support? Do
    these potential needs vary by the age and gender of children? Perhaps fathers
    play a poorly appreciated role during adolescents' critical transitions.
    If so, fathers' disengagement early in a child's life must be evaluated in
    terms of its impact on children that may manifest later in their lives.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Incomplete institutions.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Many of the transitions
    families face today occur within "incomplete institutions." Our culture has
    changed so rapidly that the new emerging family forms have not had time to
    become "institutionalized." For example, in the case of remarriage, families
    are left to invent their own transitional procedures. There are no well-defined
    "standards" one can easily adapt to the new situation. As a result, individual
    family members must decide, with little guidance from cultural scripts, what
    the new parent should be called, how distance should be regulated, who should
    discipline and when, and how money should be transferred. Policy ideals need
    to be sensitive to these fundamental changes in our society and assist families
    as they try to adjust during these critical transitions.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Duality.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Fathers also experience a duality
    in their role as parent. First, fathers may help protect and provide for
    their children while teaching them how to negotiate the difficult experiences
    they will encounter as they make the transition to adulthood. However, there
    can be a darker side to fathers' presence in their children's lives. Fathers
    sometimes present a danger to their families and trigger their children's
    self-destructive behavior. Fathers have the potential to bring about real
    harm when they are physically or mentally abusive, or when they induce children
    to leave home before they are able to sustain themselves in a risky world.
    Attempting to balance these sometimes competing realities is an important
    policymaking dilemma that should be informed by additional research.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Public policy.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>In this report we highlighted
    several proactive roles that public policy, law, and the private sector can
    develop to assist fathers to engage in responsible fathering.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Policymakers must be sensitive to structural changes in the U.S. economy
    that have disproportionately lessened economically disadvantaged fathers'
    ability to provide for their families relative to what mothers can provide,
    especially when mothers are aided by government transfer programs.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>For example, "man in the house" rules need to be re-examined. These
    rules, which have required women to remain single in order to receive certain
    government benefits, have had the effect of producing large concentrations
    of households in which fathers are "around" but not living with their children.
    This may have the unfortunate effect of undermining fathers' roles and preventing
    fathers from being responsible fathers. Some states have started to abolish
    these policies.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>Policymakers should re-evaluate the latent consequences of administrative
    rules that require fathers' child support to be used to reimburse the government
    for welfare support provided to the mother and her children. These rules
    have helped foster a climate of underground fatherhood while making it difficult
    for some fathers to be more involved with their children.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>In a similar vein, care needs to be exercised when developing incentive
    programs that prod welfare mothers to target child support enforcement actions
    at fathers. Such programs have sometimes discouraged fathers from developing
    a sense of commitment to their children.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>State and federal programs can become more father-friendly by allowing
    nonresident fathers of children on welfare to enter the JOBS program which
    currently provides the mothers of these children access to job training and
    education opportunities.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>States can be encouraged to embed specific fatherhood programs in either
    child support and/or maternal health programs.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Divorce and fathers.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Policymakers should
    heighten their understanding of the complexities that characterize divorced
    families. The debates about fathers' degree of commitment and involvement
    with their children postdivorce are volatile and complex. Many fathers experience
    emotional crises resulting from the formal and informal impediments they
    must deal with as they struggle to maintain close relationships with their
    children after the dissolution of a romantic relationship. Yet, harsh critics
    of some efforts to expand nonresident fathers' rights argue that many fathers
    are less concerned about the day-to-day care of their children than they
    are in controlling their former partners. What must not be forgotten is that
    the processes that feed into this perplexing situation occur within a society
    that remains highly gendered and the welfare of millions of children are
    at stake.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Fathers and custody issues.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>While the data
    are mixed, the joint custody arrangements may be associated with more positive
    forms of parental involvement such as child support payment rather than with
    negative paternal behavior or parental conflict. Joint custody variations
    should be researched thoroughly because they are likely to increase fathers'
    options for crafting meaningful roles with their children (typically after
    divorce or in the context of a nonmarital birth).</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>While some men want and gain either joint or sole custody, some observers
    contend that our current court system continues to mitigate toward
    disproportionate custody awards to mothers. The processes associated with
    custody decision-making need to be examined carefully in light of informed
    research.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>One difficult policy issue is deciding how government programs should
    take into account the safety of mothers and children when bona fide violence
    is present, while at the same time not confusing an allegation with proof
    of abuse. While strong incentives for spurious claims of abuse clearly exist,
    there are few disincentives for such claims. Additionally, little is known
    about the most frequent visitation problem which involves fathers who are
    legally entitled to spend time with their children, but are either completely
    or sporadically denied access by the mother.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Mothers as gatekeepers.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>As the preceding
    comments suggest, there is a great deal of concern about how mothers often
    serve as gatekeepers in divorced families and how this can hamper fathers'
    motivation to remain involved. Some research suggests that fathers who feel
    "enfranchised" are more likely to engage in long term involvement. Many fathers
    feel that issues related to their divorce, especially concerns about their
    children, are out of their control and that policies and other legal barriers
    prevent them from continuing to be committed and responsible caretakers.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Geographic barriers.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Some fathers (and mothers)
    face the prospects of a former partner taking their children and moving to
    another area. Clearly, if the child(ren) stays with the mother, fathers can
    not retain the same day-to-day involvement that is possible when both parents
    remain in the same location. This hotly debated area finds many feminists
    arguing that no restrictions should be placed on mothers' (or fathers') mobility,
    while opponents argue that custodial parents who want to relocate and take
    their child should be forced to demonstrate that such a move is necessary,
    for either health or employment reasons. Additional research on the consequences
    of relocation on all involved parties is needed to inform policy in this
    area.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Paternity establishment.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>An important component
    of child support enforcement is paternity establishment. States are using
    a variety of methods to establish paternity in hopes of maximizing the ability
    of the state to enforce child support claims against the father and encourage
    fathers to develop a stronger commitment to their children. One of the key
    issues associated with child support enforcement policy is the extent to
    which the resources of the program will be used to mediate conflicts arising
    over visitation, for example the suspension of drivers licenses (Utah) if
    the mother refuses to cooperate in allowing visitation access is being explored.
    Policymakers face a major challenge in finding an optimal child support
    enforcement policy that maximizes the financial commitment of nonresident
    fathers while ensuring that fathers have ample opportunity to spend quality
    time with their children. Experience with attempts to enforce child support
    obligations has revealed that fathers' visitation patterns are related to
    child support payment, and greater contact may be related to better outcomes
    for children.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Starting places.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>Health insurance determinations
    and policies about such programs as Head start were also mentioned as places
    where strong father/family friendly programs could be built. Additionally,
    there is a new awareness that intervention programs that help imprisoned
    fathers be better fathers might break the intergenerational transmission
    of institutionalization. Some states are experimenting with intervention
    programs in the juvenile justice system with the hopes of figuring out innovative
    ways of promoting styles of fathering that will break the intergenerational
    transmission of anti-social behavior.</FONT>
    <P>
    <I><FONT><B>Other barriers.</B> </FONT></I><FONT>We reiterate here the plea
    by many researchers and policymakers that we need to consider how policies
    targeted at the work place can be used to promote more positive father
    involvement. For example, it was mentioned that:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>The balance between work and family roles has generally focused on
    women, because women have traditionally taken the primary responsibility
    for child rearing while participating in the market as secondary earners;
    men have been considered the family breadwinner. The "new" father is expected
    to increase in his caretaking role and share in that responsibility. This
    will mean changes in the expectations that men have for themselves at work,
    not to mention the expectation business has for the involved father.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>In 1993 President Clinton, signed the Family and Medical Leave Act
    (FMLA) that allowed parents to take up to six weeks of unpaid leave to care
    for a newborn or adopted child or another family member who is sick. Such
    policies seek to eliminate workplace barriers and allow either parent to
    participate in child care. While this is a good beginning it should be contrasted
    with parents in Sweden who can take up to a total of 15 months in paid leave
    to be shared between the mother and father.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>The advent of more flexible working hours may serve to facilitate paternal
    involvement. For example, one measure of fathers' involvement with their
    children is the frequency that they provide child care while the mother works.
    This may be possible when work schedules are more flexible.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>A ground swell of support has emerged for researchers and policymakers
    to reexamine how we view children's well-being. Research agendas and policy
    decisions need to be sensitive to the positive ways fathers might be involved
    in family life. Government programs need to include ways to enhance (not
    limit) the ability of fathers to engage in their primary responsibilities,
    that of co-caring for the well-being of their children. As we learn more
    about fathers' potential to affect children's fragile world, it behooves
    us to (re)consider how to alter those barriers that preclude fathers from
    being involved with their children in positive ways while enhancing the necessary
    incentives to prod them to take up their important roles in earnest.</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT>Recommendations</FONT></B>
    <P>
    <FONT>Throughout this report, we have suggested that any (re)conceptualization
    of father involvement should attend to several interrelated themes and contexts.
    As part of this discussion we have emphasized that we need to be mindful
    that father-child issues are:</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>shaped by particular structural or familial contexts,</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>embedded within a larger ecological context influenced by social class
    and race factors,</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>often fundamentally shaped by gender due to its role as a major organizing
    principle of social life,</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>intimately related to developmental trajectories and life course
    considerations (with particular attention to children's experiences).</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>1. Our most general recommendation, then, is that researchers and
    policymakers interested in father involvement and children's
    well-being/development attend to these themes in a systematic way.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>2. Researchers should continue to show how conceptual and theoretical
    concerns, measurement and data questions, and policymaking issues overlap
    and mutually inform each other. These efforts are essential if we are to
    develop better research strategies and ultimately a more complete understanding
    of why and how fathers are involved with their children, and contribute to
    their well-being and development.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>3. At the outset of this report, we mentioned that there are some general
    ways of thinking about fatherhood from a social or legal perspective that
    in essence considers "father" as some type of status--and the implications
    this distinction engenders. More work needs to be done to answer the question:
    Who are fathers? Decisions about the basic definition of "father" are critical
    and should be examined from various disciplinary perspectives. Thus, attention
    should be given to developing concepts that capture the meaning and definition
    of who fathers are. These concepts should address conceptions of fatherhood
    throughout the life course (pre-birth through grandparenting). As researchers
    we should be interested in how individuals, subcultural groups, interest
    groups, the legal system, media, etc. construct the images associated with
    fatherhood.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>4. Following from #3, researchers and policymakers should attempt to
    understand individuals' perceptions of the varied meanings associated with
    biological and social fatherhood and the consequences of these perceptions.
    Under what circumstances does biological paternity entitle men to certain
    rights or elicit certain obligations? What should those rights and obligations
    be as defined by the various stakeholders?</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>5. In addition, we need to explore how individuals distinguish between
    fathers' investments or perceptions of their status as father versus their
    views and involvement in the process of fathering. As researchers we need
    to be clear on these two different meanings associated with fatherhood. These
    distinctions are related to disciplinary perspectives and ideological views
    to some extent, but they also play themselves out in the way individuals
    think, feel, and act when they're "doing fatherhood" or interpreting others
    as they're "doing fatherhood."</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>6. In addition to looking at fatherhood as a social or legal status,
    research and social policy needs to focus on fathering as a process. We also
    need to develop a better understanding of individuals' motivations for fathering
    that takes into account individuals' views (and their commitment to others'
    views) of different ways to be involved.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>7. More attention should be given to the specific context and
    family-related processes that either facilitate or impede specific expressions
    of fathering, and shape children's well-being and development. While there
    have been some attempts to collect data about these important facets of family
    life, data are rarely collected from multiple perspectives and almost never
    focus on the inner dynamics of family life. Research and policymaking should
    take a cue from the emerging dialogue about generative fathering and positive
    paternal involvement. Thus, future research needs to continue to move beyond
    the deficit model approach where fathers' influence is assessed in terms
    of absence and/or negative involvement. There is a serious need for greater
    understanding of how fatherhood is negotiated, directly or indirectly by
    various parties (mothers and children in particular, and grandparents in
    nonmaritals birth to young persons). Focusing on mothers/partners' roles
    as gate-keepers is an essential element to this effort.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>8. Researchers should strive to develop a more systematic and richer
    portrait of how men, women, and children (from different class and race)
    backgrounds view aspects of fatherhood. This would clarify the cultural norms
    associated with fatherhood. Researchers have only begun to identify this
    portrait and still know very little about such obvious aspects of the parenting
    role as protecting and breadwinning.</FONT>
    <P>
    <U><FONT>More specifically:</FONT></U>
    <P>
    <FONT>We need to explore what being a biological and/or social father means
    to men, prior to conception, during pregnancy, and during the child's
    life.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>What do each of these ways of distinguishing fathers mean for fathers,
    mothers, and children?</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>What are individuals' (fathers, mothers, and children) views of "good"
    fathering and how are they conditioned by individual, interpersonal, and
    more macro or cultural level factors?</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>How do these interpretations affect how fathers are involved in children's
    lives? How are these meanings affected by children's developmental stage,
    children's personality, children's gender, family structure situation,
    perceptions about the value of particular ways fathers might be or are involved,
    interpersonal ties and negotiations with the mother of the children?</FONT>
    <P>
    <B><FONT>Recommendations Focusing on Data Collection and
    Policymakers</FONT></B>
    <P>
    <FONT>1. We applaud the efforts of the NICHD community for recognizing that
    the work on father involvement is best done in an interdisciplinary context.
    For example, those who worked on this report and committee brought diverse
    interests and disciplines as we focused on the many different topics that
    affect fathers and their children. Future data collection efforts should
    therefore, at minimum, demonstrate a sensitivity to the research community
    comprised of family social demographers, developmental psychologists, family
    relations and human developmentalists, social psychologists, sociologists,
    family legal scholars, family economists, and probably others.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>2. Research and funding communities need to increase their efforts
    to improve large scale data collection efforts. While this process has begun,
    much more refinement is possible. We suggest that the federal and
    foundation-based funding agencies initiate a data collection effort in which
    men's/father's issues are the theme rather than an afterthought.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>3. Additionally, we recommend that funding agencies promote smaller
    scale studies that feature fatherhood topics. The series of NICHD sponsored
    conferences on fathering during 1996-97 have clearly shown that smaller scale
    projects can and do generate excellent research that helps us understand
    the process of parent-child interaction. Indeed, there are many important
    topics which simply cannot be approached with larger data efforts.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>4. By necessity, research and funding agencies should focus a great
    deal of our limited resources on studying the processes associated with key
    transitions that affect fathering. At the same time, studying fathers and
    children in more stable contexts is important, but public policy, though
    potentially useful in some ways when it comes to stable well-functioning
    families, is largely not as relevant during these stable times. To the extent
    possible, we should explore the interpersonal dynamics and social processes
    that enable fathers to make a positive contribution to their children's lives
    in stable households.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT>From a policy perspective, we should be particularly interested in
    the meanings of paternal involvement and its expression during<I> crisis
    or transitional periods</I> (e.g., issues associated with nonmarital births,
    divorce and custody issues, men making the transition into or out of prison,
    the competing demands associated with work and family transitions when children
    are infants, and job loss).</FONT>

<A NAME="N_1_"></A>1. We use the phrases "father involvement" and "paternal
involvement" interchangeably to capture the wide range of things fathers
do with or for their children. Blankenhorn (drawing on a conservative ideological
stance) and Popenoe (relying on the tenets of evolutionary psychology) are
likely to take issue with this trend. Blankenhorn in particular suggest that
it is folly to think that persons other than biological fathers can replace
all of the contributions men and uniquely capable of making to their genetic
offspring.
<P>
<A NAME="N_2_"></A>2. Given our recognition of the major social policy issues
affecting children in our society, and the limited scope of our report, we
focus on fathers' involvement as it relates to minor children. We believe,
however, that many of the issues we address are likely to have long-term
implications for children once they become adults. Moreover, many of the
issues central to our report are directly relevant to those young adults
who have not yet become financially self-sufficient.
<P>
<A NAME="N_3_"></A>3. <FONT> While our report focuses on questions dealing
with fathers specifically, we should be mindful that these questions are
relevant to the more general public discourses about the definition and meaning
of family life in industrialized societies today (see Beutler, Burr, Bahr,
and Herrin, 1989; Delaisi de Parseval and Hurstel, 1987; Edwards, 1989; Griswold,
1993; Jurich, 1989; Menaghan, 1989; Scanzoni and Marsiglio, 1993; Scanzoni,
Polonko, Teachman and Thompson, 1989).</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="N_4_"></A>4. See Blankenhorn (1995) and Popenoe (1996) for notable
exceptions to this trend. They both emphasize the biological relationship
as the only legitimate way to conceptualize fatherhood. Each also suggests
that it is folly to think that persons other than biological fathers can
replace all of the contributions men are uniquely capable of making to their
genetic offspring. These views are often buttressed by an appeal to a religious
fundamentalist doctrine.
<P>
<A NAME="N_5_"></A>5. See Fox and Bruce (1996) and Marsiglio (forthcoming)
for discussions about how symbolic interactionists theorize the interpersonal
processes that foster or hinder men's opportunities to develop a sense of
having a "father-like" identity.
<P>
<A NAME="N_6_"></A>6. Some psychoanalytically inclined theorists with interests
in object relations theory and self psychology have recently emphasized the
need to explore unconventional and controversial innate variables such as
"father presence" (see Krampe and Fairweather, 1993).
<P>
<A NAME="N_7_"></A>7. The NICHD working group "Male Fertility and Family
Formation/Dissolution" address some issues related to this area.
<P>
<A NAME="N_8_"></A>8. See Nock (forthcoming) for an alternative perspective.
<P>
<A NAME="N_9_"></A>9. The evidence presented in this research does not allow
us to determine whether the spending on a higher quality home environment
(e.g., a good neighborhood and school system, higher quality child care,
or cognitively stimulating toys and books) itself causes better outcomes,
or whether that spending is, instead, only a marker for parents who value
cognitive success and who spend time nurturing their children's cognitive
abilities.
<P>
<A NAME="N_10_"></A>10. The data cited here are reports from custodial mothers.
Several studies (Peters and Argys, 1996; Seltzer, 1996; and Smock and Manning,
1996) show that fathers generally report paying more than mothers report
receiving.
