Hi Molly &#8212; Thanks for sharing your experiences. Your mother sounds
<BR>braver than I. There is a significant homeschooling community here, and
<BR>while some people definitely think we're doing a disservice to our kids,
<BR>it's not *that* hard to weather it. I'm interested in how much people
<BR>think kids just *should* be in school. As if it were some law of nature
<BR>or something. I think a big part of the explanation is that school is
<BR>training for the rest of life according to the rules and pressures of
<BR>today's institutions &#8212; alienating work, a profit-oriented economy,
<BR>irrational hierarchies, etc. I don't believe those are healthy
<BR>institutions, so I don't anyone should be trained to suffer them.
<BR>
<BR>The question is: what's a collective solution? (Individuals deciding to
<BR>homeschool really isn't any more than a private solution.) More and
<BR>more, I wonder if we shouldn't be looking at education reform in a whole
<BR>new light. I propose a paradigm shift: free and open (and voluntary)
<BR>schools, lots of space and opportunity for physical activity, no
<BR>homework, teachers as resources and facilitators &#8212; not instructors,
<BR>per se, the community-as-classroom, mentoring, apprenticing, treating
<BR>youth as if they are an integral part of the community, as if their
<BR>minds matter &#8212; not just for solving problems on a worksheet but for
<BR>solving problems in *the course of daily life.* Put resources into
<BR>building safe communities with infrastructure that &quot;scaffolds&quot; young
<BR>people into what it means to be a member of a community. Ultimately:
<BR>trust the kids. I know it sounds radical. But we don't need to fear
<BR>young people. They are an amazing resource to be embraced an nurtured.
<BR>Instead, it seems to me, we treat them as future criminals who have to
<BR>be curbed and controlled and disciplined rather than *sought out* for
<BR>who they are.
<BR>
<BR>Molly: To answer your questions at the end of your email: Zoe works in
<BR>a bakery, is doing some internships, and volunteers at a bookstore. She
<BR>takes a photography and a woodworking class, and she does a lot of her
<BR>own writing. She's got a lively social life and she watches movies and
<BR>keeps up her MySpace and Friends pages. My 11-year old has homeschooled
<BR>her whole life, until this Sept. when she started 6th grade. Her
<BR>favorite things at school are &quot;Friday share&quot; (a community-wide meeting)
<BR>and independent lunch (a special lunch that she can eat in the classroom
<BR>instead of in the lunch room &#8212; which is a purely chaotic and
<BR>inhospitable place).

</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> I enjoyed your articles- coming from a homeschooling family myself. I
</I><BR><BR>never
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> had any interest in &quot;trying&quot; public school after my mom pulled me out
</I><BR><BR>after
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> 3rd grade. When I was 16 I enrolled in the local community college
</I><BR><BR>for some
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> classes, and that was as close to a traditional experience that I
</I><BR><BR>got. 13
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> years later I went on to get my Master's in education and I worked as
</I><BR><BR>a
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> teacher at a public middle school in southern California because I
</I><BR><BR>love
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> education, learning, and I love helping people. 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> I no longer work at the school- the stresses were just too great for
</I><BR><BR>many of
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> the reasons you mention in your article. I found myself continually
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> supporting the petty things you talk about in your articles (such as
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> requiring name and section number in a special place on a project),
</I><BR><BR>just to
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> survive on a daily basis (otherwise the name and section might not
</I><BR><BR>appear on
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> the project, or I might not ever find it- but I hated that I had to
</I><BR><BR>devote
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> my time to such mundane things for grading purposes). I taught
</I><BR><BR>language
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> arts, social studies, and high school credit French, and the average
</I><BR><BR>class
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> size was 35 students. At our department meetings I learned that we
</I><BR><BR>talked
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> about what all we were required to do by the state, but we all knew
</I><BR><BR>that
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> under the circumstances we could not, so we just planned our lesson
</I><BR><BR>and did
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> our true best. Meanwhile students were coming to school needing help
</I><BR><BR>dealing
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> with parents who had committed suicide or who were in the middle of
</I><BR><BR>messy
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> divorces, pressure from older siblings to get involved in local
</I><BR><BR>gangs, and
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> kids who weren't ready developmentally for some of the higher level
</I><BR><BR>thinking
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> skills that are required by the state standards. I admire teachers
</I><BR><BR>who do a
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> good job in the circumstances that they face daily, they really amaze
</I><BR><BR>me. It
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> is a gift. People used to make jokes, wondering what was in my karma
</I><BR><BR>that
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> allowed me to avoid the public schools for so long, but then come
</I><BR><BR>back as a
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> teacher. 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> I my home-schooling experience however, my mother did &quot;make&quot; us study
</I><BR><BR>the
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> minimum high school requirements as outlined in the public school
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> curriculum, and we took standard tests every year to make sure that
</I><BR><BR>we were
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> keeping up with other kids our age. She un-enrolled us from school
</I><BR><BR>because
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> she felt that she could do a better job (without a college education)
</I><BR><BR>than
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> the public schools, and I believe that she did. In the early 80's
</I><BR><BR>that was
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> considered child abuse by most of the community that we lived in, and
</I><BR><BR>she
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> had to work hard to prove that we weren't being deprived of a decent
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> education.
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> I would imagine that you face similar sentiments with your daughter
</I><BR><BR>and her
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> self-directed education. How do you address those concerns or talk
</I><BR><BR>about it
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> with others? 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> I am curious to know what Zoe is up to now- and what is happening
</I><BR><BR>with your
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> other children? 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> 
</I><BR><BR>&gt;<i> There is a lot of research done on students who are in or who remain
</I><BR><BR>in the
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> public school system. I think there is very little research done
</I><BR><BR>about kids
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> who are in private schools, alternative schools, or in home
</I><BR><BR>schooling
<BR><BR>&gt;<i> families.
