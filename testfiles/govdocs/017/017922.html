            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Washington, 
              D.C. -- House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi today released the 
              following statement in honor of Veterans Day:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Veterans 
              Day is a day to honor and remember the courageous and faithful men 
              and women who have served our country in uniform. No group of Americans 
              has stood stronger and braver for our nation than our veterans. 
              From the bitter cold winter at Valley Forge to the boiling hot Iraqi 
              terrain, our soldiers have courageously answered when called, gone 
              where ordered, and defended our nation with honor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;On the 
              battlefields of war, our soldiers pledge to leave no one behind. 
              As a nation it must be our pledge that, after our soldiers come 
              home, we will leave no veteran behind. Our veterans served for all 
              of us. We must be there for all of them. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Democrats 
              have proposed a comprehensive package of legislation that keeps 
              America&#146;s promise to our veterans. Today, veterans&#146; health 
              care is in crisis, with 60,000 veterans waiting up to six months 
              for an appointment at Veterans Affairs hospitals. Democrats are 
              fighting to provide an additional $1.8 billion for next year to 
              improve veterans&#146; health care. And we have taken action to 
              block the Bush Administration's proposal to increase prescription 
              drug co-payments and enrollment fees.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Democrats 
              are leading the charge to end the national disgrace of the disabled 
              veterans tax, which denies more than 500,000 disabled veterans their 
              full retirement and disability benefits. Because of Democratic pressure, 
              the Republicans have put forward a plan, but it leaves far too many 
              veterans behind. Under the Republican plan, two-thirds of our veterans 
              still will not receive one penny of compensation for their disabilities. 
              Democrats will stand for all of our disabled veterans and will continue 
              to fight for full concurrent receipt, making sure that no soldier 
              is left behind. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;On this 
              Veterans Day, with tomorrow&#146;s veterans now serving in Iraq 
              and Afghanistan, we should renew our national promise to fulfill 
              our sacred obligations to those who have worn this nation&#146;s 
              uniform. Our veterans and their families ask for nothing more. They 
              deserve nothing less.&quot;</font><br>
