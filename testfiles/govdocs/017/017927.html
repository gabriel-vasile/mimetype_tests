You may recall that the newsletter included a reprint of the Ted Rockwell address to the 1998
ANS Radiation Protection and Shielding Division Topical Conference, held in Nashville,
Tennessee. As the editor who assembles this newsletter monthly, I occasionally get evidence that
the material is read. One of our readers read Rockwell's statement very thoroughly and noted a
discrepancy between the text and the table. The email exchange of information is given below

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><!--mstheme--></font><pre>Date: Mon, 22 Jun 1998 070938 -0600
From: Brian D Harlow &lt;HARLBD@inel.gov&gt;
Subject: Why Low-Level Radiation Can?t Cause Cancer
To: rsic@ornl.gov

I just finished reading the May newsletter from the Radiation Safety
Information Computational and was interested in the article &quot;Why
Low-Level Radiation Can't Cause Cancer.&quot; However, looking at the
numbers presented in the article, an error seemingly appeared. It
stated that about 99.99% of the DNA alterations are repaired in the
metabolic case, and about 1 in 500 in the radiation case. That would
mean that 499 in 500 DNA alterations are not repaired in the radiation
case. However, in the subsequent table &quot;Number of Events Occurring
Daily in Each Cell of the Body&quot; the number 1 in 500 un/misrepaired
alterations (DNA alterations not repaired) is used instead of the
actual number of 499 in 500 DNA alterations not repaired as stated in
the text. This would change the final ratio of mutation, radiation to
metabolism to about 1 to 2,000. This is still a substantial ratio
between the two types of mutation sources but is substantially less
than the printed 1 to 10,000,000.

Bernadette et al.

When I write something, it's nice to know that it's not only read, but
read carefully and with understanding. You have caught a clear
disconnect between the table and the words. Thanks for pointing that
out.

The table is correct. I originally described all this in exponential
form, and then tried to simplify it by talking about percentages. I
shouldn't have. It's 1 in 10,000 single breaks that fail to repair
properly, and 1 in 500 for the double breaks. As you pointed out, the
words said it backwards for the double breaks.

I hope your readers found this paper helpful. As you noted, even if
the words were right and the table wrong, the basic point would still
hold, though less dramatically.

Thanks again for the feedback.

COLLECTION<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
Four changes or additions were made to the computer code collection during the month. One new
code system was packaged and added to the collection, one code system was replaced with a
newly frozen version, the documentation was updated on an existing code package and an
existing code package was corrected.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><a href="http://www-rsicc.ornl.gov/codes/ccc/ccc5/ccc-552.html"><img src="news98.june.htg/img2.gif" width="209" height="127" align="left"></a>Argonne National Laboratory contributed a newly frozen
version of this code system to calculate site-specific residual
radioactive material guidelines and radiation dose and excess
cancer risk to an on-site resident. The revised package
includes RESRAD 5.82 and RESRAD-BUILD 2.36. 

<p>RESRAD 5.82 requires a Windows operating system and is
compatible with Windows95, WindowsNT, or Windows 3.1.
The primary modifications in this 4/30/98 release include:

<p>1) Allows plot data to be exported to tab-delimited text file, <br>
2) Corrected an installation problem on Windows 3.1,<br>
3) Corrected a plotting problem for soil guidelines.

<p>RESRAD-BUILD Version 2.36 is a pathway analysis model designed to evaluate the potential
radiological dose incurred by an individual who works or lives in a building contaminated with
radioactive material. The radioactive material in the building structure can be released into the
indoor air by mechanisms such as diffusion (radon gas), mechanical removal (decontamination
activities), or erosion (removable surface contamination). Features in Version 2.36 include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1) Corrected a problem with simultaneously changing number of wall regions and their
parameters, <br>
2) Added an OK button to uncertainty window,<br>
3) Made sure first uncertainty variable is added on first try.

<p>The Lahey F77L3/EM-32 and Microsoft Visual Basic compilers were used to create most
RESRAD executables included in the package. The RESPLOT executable was created with
Lahey and MicroGlyph SCIPLOT 5.0. The new RESRAD and RESRAD-BUILD executables run
under Windows 3.1, Windows95 and Windows NT 4.0. <strong>Note that the source files are not
included.</strong> The package is distributed on five DS/HD 3.5-in. (1.44 MB) diskettes in
self-extracting compressed DOS files. Reference: ANL/EAD/LD-2 (Sept. 1993) and
ANL/EAIS-8 (April 1993), ANL/EAD/LD-3 (Nov. 1994). Fortran 77 and BASIC; PC 386 or 486

advised RSICC of a correction to the MELCOR Accident
Consequence Code System designated MACCS2, which was
developed to estimate the potential impacts to the surrounding
public of severe accidents at nuclear power plants. The
principal phenomena considered in MACCS are atmospheric
transport and deposition under time-variant meteorology,
short-term and long-term mitigative actions and exposure
pathways, deterministic and stochastic health effects, and economic costs of mitigative actions.
Two defect notifications M2V1-12A and M2V1-12B describe the defects and the methods to
avoid involving them in a calculation. The notifications are available on the WWW and are being
added to the RSICC package documentation. No changes to the software are being made at this
time, but these defects will be corrected in the next release of MACCS2. A release date for the
new version is not known at this time. For those users with access the web the corrections can be
found at <a href="maccnote.pdf">maccnote.pdf</a>.

<p>MACCS2 runs on IBM compatible 80486 or Pentium PC with 8 MB of RAM under DOS,
Windows95 or WindowsNT. The Lahey F77L3/EM-32 Version 5.2 compiler was used to create
the executables included in the package, which is transmitted on nine 1.44 MB 3.5-in. DOS
formatted diskettes in self-extracting archive files. References:

contributed a new code system to determine alpha,n;
spontaneous-fission; and beta-n delayed neutron sources and
spectra due to the decay of radionuclides in homogeneous media. The code also calculates
alpha,n sources and spectra in interface problems where the alpha source material is in one region
and the (alpha,n) target material is in an adjacent region. Spontaneous-fission spectra are
calculated with evaluated half-life, spontaneous-fission branching and Watt spectrum parameters
for 43 actinides. The (alpha,n) spectra are calculated using an assumed isotropic neutron angular
distribution in the center-of-mass system with a library of 89 nuclide decay alpha spectra, 24 sets
of measured and/or evaluated (alpha,n) cross sections and product nuclide level branching
fractions, and functional alpha stopping cross sections for Z &lt; 106.

<p>SOURCES3A runs on Sun, IBM RS/6000 and personal computers. The package is transmitted
on one diskette and includes the Fortran source, PC executable, data libraries, and test cases in

contributed a minor correction to this multidimensional,
finite-difference heat conduction analysis code system.
HEATING can solve steady-state and/or transient heat
conduction problems in one-, two-, or three-dimensional
Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates. Both
HEATING 7.2i and HEATING7.3 are distributed in this
package. The correction was made to Subroutine H7MAP in
HEATING 7.2i and in Subroutine H73MAP in HEATING
7.3, and the H73MAP executable was recompiled. The change impacts output for 1-dimensional
problems. If the number of nodes is large enough that the output exceeds one page in length, only
part of the output is displayed. The output from the first few temperatures is repeated, and the
rest of the output is never printed.

<p>HEATING7.2i runs on several Unix systems including IBM RS/6000, Sun, DEC, DEC Alpha,
HP and Cray. Fortran 77 and C compilers are required. For the PC version, a Fortran compiler
and DOS extender software are needed to create new executables or to compile and load
user-supplied subroutines. The Microway NDP Fortran 386 4.2.1 compiler was used to create
7.2i executables included in package. HEATING 7.3 is written in Fortran 77 but includes some
Fortran 90 features. HEATING 7.3 PC executables were created using Microsoft Powerstation
v4.0. Visual Basic 4.0 was used to create the graphical front end for the program. Windows95 or
WindowsNT is required to use the GUI version of HEATING 7.3, though a non-GUI version is
included in the package that may be run in a DOS window of Windows95 or WindowsNT.
HEATING7.3 for Unix was tested only on IBM RS/6000 and requires the XLF 3.2 compiler.
Included are the referenced document and one CD-ROM which contains source, PC executables,
script files, and sample cases. The Unix versions are written in compressed Unix tar files.

The Seventh Annual Meeting of the Council on Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards
(CIRMS) will be held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg,
Maryland, October 19-21, 1998. CIRMS is a non-profit, U.S. Council, with representation from
academic, professional and industrial associations and organizations, government agencies and
interested individuals. CIRMS provides an opportunity for open discussion of current issues
concerning ionizing radiation and future directions of measurements and standards.

<p>The focus of the meeting will be the role of the National Laboratories in ionizing radiation
measurements and standards. The National Laboratories play pivotal roles in standards
development and implementation and in the development of state-of-the-art technologies for
ionizing radiation measurements and standardization. Sessions will include medical applications,
occupational radiation protection, public and environmental radiation protection, and industrial
applications and materials effects, each session addressing the subject of one of the CIRMS
Science and Technology Subcommittees. For more information contact Katy Nardi, (770)
