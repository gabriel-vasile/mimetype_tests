	  <p><strong>1825 - Philosophy of Systematic Scientific Observations and Elimination
	    of Error</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Absolute mathematical accuracy exists only in the mind of man. All
	    practical applications are mere approximations, more or less successful.
	    And when all has been done that science and art can unite in practice, the
	    supposition of some defects in the instruments will always be prudent. It
	    becomes therefore the duty of an observer to combine and invent, upon theoretical
	    principals, methods of systematical observations, by which the influence
	    of any error of his instruments may be neutralised, either by direct means,
	    or more generally by compensation.&rdquo; In the Principal Documents (1825)

	  <p><strong>1854 -Benjamin Peirce and the Ultimate Limits of Accuracy</strong></p>
	  <p>As powerful as the method of &ldquo;least squares&rdquo; is, under certain
	    conditions its most probable estimation of truth may in fact be quite misleading.
	    Superintendent Bache&rsquo;s good friend, Harvard mathematician Benjamin
	    Peirce, pointed this out in a treatise appended to the Coast Survey report
	    for 1854 under the unlikely name &ldquo;Report upon the Determination of
	    Longitude by Moon Culminations.&rdquo; Although meant as an argument in
	    favor of his thesis that longitude determinations by moon culminations of
	    the Pleiades had the potential to be the most accurate possible, this document
	    is memorable for its lucid discussion of the various types of observational
	    errors as well as for its understanding of the ultimate attainable limits
	    of accuracy. As such, Peirce&rsquo;s major points are applicable to most
	    types of scientific observation and the paper could be considered a landmark
	    in American scientific thought.</p>
	  <p>Peirce began with the supposition that with only one observation of a physical
	    quantity that observation must be adopted as the true value of the constant.
	    However, &ldquo;A second observation gives a second determination, which
	    is always found to differ from the first. The difference of the observations
	    is an indication of the accuracy of each, while the mean of the two determinations
	    is a new determination which may be regarded as more accurate than either. &rdquo;</p>
	  <p>As more and more observations are acquired, &quot;The comparison of the
	    mean with the individual determinations has shown, in all cases in which
	    such comparison has been instituted, that the errors of lunar observation
	    [or most species of scientific observation are subject to law, and are not
	    distributed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. They are the symmetrical
	    and concentrated groupings of a skillful marksman aiming at a target, and
	    not the random scatterings of a blind man, nor even the designed irregularities
	    of the stars in the firmament. This law of human error is the more remarkable,
	    and worthy of philosophic examination, that it is precisely that which is
	    required to render the arithmetical mean of observations the most probable
	    approach to the exact result. It has been made the foundation of the method
	    of least squares, and its introduction into astronomy by the illustrious
	    Gauss is the last great era of this science. &rdquo;<br />
	    Peirce continued: &ldquo;If the law of error embodied in the method of least
	    squares were the sole law to which human error is subject, it would happen
	    that by a sufficient accumulation of observations any imagined degree of
	    accuracy would be attainable in the determination of a constant; and the
	    evanescent influence of minute increments of error would have the effect
	    of exalting man&rsquo;s power of exact observation to an unlimited extent.
	    I believe that the careful examination of observations reveals another law
	    of error, which is involved in the popular statement that &lsquo;man cannot
	    measure what he cannot see.&rsquo; The small errors which are beyond the
	    limits of human perception, are not distributed according to the mode recognised
	    by the method of least squares, but either with the uniformity which is
	    the ordinary characteristic of matters of chance, or more frequently in
	    some arbitrary form dependent upon individual peculiarities -- such, for
	    instance, as an habitual inclination to the use of certain numbers. On this
	    account it is in vain to attempt the comparison of the distribution of errors
	    with the law of least squares to too great a degree of minuteness; and on
	    this account there is in every species of observation an ultimate limit
	    of accuracy beyond which no mass of accumulated observations can ever penetrate.</p>
	  <p>&quot;A wise observer, when he perceives that he is approaching this limit,
	    will apply his powers to improving the methods, rather than to increasing
	    the number of observations. This principle will thus serve to stimulate,
	    and not to paralyze effort; and its vivifying influence will prevent science
	    from stagnating into mere mechanical drudgery....&rdquo; In Annual Report
	    of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey for 1854 (1855). Appendix 36 &ldquo;Report

	  <p><strong>1858 - Deep-Sea Sounding Difficulties</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The explorations of the Gulf Stream by officers of our navy, in connection
	    with the survey of the coast, first gave rise to systematic efforts to determine
	    sections of the bottom of the sea along lines of great depth; afterwards
	    the extensive system of deep-sea soundings executed under the direction
	    of the Navy Department, through the exertions of Lieut. Maury, furnished
	    most useful experience and results, and more recently the soundings along
	    the line of the proposed Atlantic telegraph, first by Lieut. Comg. Berryman,
	    United States navy, and again by Lieut. Comg. Joseph Dayman, R.N., have
	    shown that to reach the bottom of the sea is not beyond the power of human
	    effort.</p>
	  <p>&quot;Notwithstanding so much has been done to overcome the practical difficulties
	    which formerly embarrassed and discouraged any attempts to sound at great
	    depths, it is undeniable that much uncertainty exists in the determinations
	    that have been made even when the depth is not greater than 2,000 fathoms;
	    while below 2,000 or 2,500 fathoms, the errors and uncertainties amount
	    to failures; and a limit has been reached beyond which it seems difficult
	    to pass.</p>
	  <p>When the subject is viewed as a mechanical problem it seems hardly possible,
	    however, that insurmountable obstacles can exist to its practical solution.
	    The facility with which an observer can place himself over any point, the
	    distance of which below the plane on which he rests it is his object to
	    determine, and from which he is separated by a medium freely and almost
	    equally penetrable at all depths, the laws of which are well known, would
	    seem to offer greater hopes of our being able ultimately, to determine the
	    depressions of the bottom of the ocean by a greater number of observations,
	    and with greater accuracy, than the elevations of the continents.</p>
	  <p>&quot;The solution of the question requires that the difficulties which
	    have been found to exist in the present methods of sounding, should be clearly
	    determined and overcome, and when these methods fail, that they should be
	    improved, if possible, or new ones substituted. . .&quot; In &quot;Investigation

	    by William A. Harris, Washington. pp. 228-239.</p>
	  <p><strong>1858 - Need for Improved Modes of Sounding</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The idea of a &lsquo;plateau&rsquo; existing between Newfoundland
	    and Ireland is not warranted, it seems to me, by any observations that have
	    yet been made. The range of errors may be as great as 500 fathoms, which
	    would admit of the existence of a submarine mountain on this line half as
	    high as Mount Washington. A true section of the Atlantic can only be determined
	    by improved modes of sounding, since, from the preceding discussion, we
	    may be warranted in the conclusion that it is practically impossible to
	    determine the greatest depths of the ocean by the methods now in use.&rdquo; In &quot;Investigation

	  <p><strong>1880 - American Pride</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Without specifying the great results obtained from this continuous
	    research, I may be pardoned in referring with some gratification to the
	    fact that in the small steamer &lsquo;Blake,&rsquo; of only three hundred
	    and fifty tons burthen, N.M., under the energetic and skillful commands
	    of Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee and Commander Bartlett, with a full complement
	    of forty-five including officers and crew, more rapid work was done than
	    had been accomplished with the old methods and appliances by the Challenger,
	    a vessel of over 2,000 tons burthen, with a complement of twenty-nine naval
	    and civil officers and a correspondingly large crew.&rdquo; Carlile Patterson
	    in introduction to &ldquo;Deep Sea Sounding and Dredging: A Description
	    and Discussion of the Methods and Appliances Used on Board the Coast and
	    Geodetic Survey Steamer, Blake,&rdquo; by Charles D. Sigsbee, 1880. Published
	    by Government Printing Office, Washington. p. 5.</p>
	  <p><strong>1880 - Early Advances on the Blake</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;A question may naturally arise as to the considerations which would
	    authorize a notice of the methods and appliances of the Blake&rsquo;s party.
	    To this it is replied---</p>
	  <p>&quot;We were one of the first, after Sir William Thomson, and Capt. George
	    E. Belknap, U.S.N., to use piano-forte wire for sounding purposes, and we
	    probably continued its use for a longer time than any other organization.</p>
	  <p>The Blake is the only vessel that has ever been fitted out with wire rope
	    (the suggestion of Prof. Alexander Agassiz) for deep-sea dredging and trawling.</p>
	  <p>But little has been published concerning the use of wire for sounding;
	    and of wire rope for dredging, nothing, in fact, excepting in a general
	    account of the Blake's dredging work by Professor Agassiz.</p>
	  <p>Nearly all the apparatus for sounding and dredging used on board the Blake
	    is new or modified from previous forms, and is peculiar to that vessel,
	    the water-cup (Plates 20 and 40) being the first and only instrument in
	    the field for the performance of the complex work aimed at in its design.</p>
	  <p>These appliances, which are intended to effect an advance in accuracy or
	    in celerity of operations, and to secure ultimate economy, have been well
	    tested in actual service, and are believed to have accomplished, at least
	    in some degree, the object sought.</p>
	  <p>Having had unusual facilities, in connection with continuous work, our
	    methods were perhaps more systematic in certain directions than are generally
	    followed by parties or organizations for the prosecution of deep-sea work.&rdquo; In

	  <p><strong>1880 - Working on the Blake</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The longest continuous run that we ever made on sounding-lines occupied
	    eleven days, although that length of time was nearly equaled on several
	    occasions. These long runs were sometimes executed under such trying circumstances
	    of wind, weather, sea, and current as to impose much mental strain on the
	    officers and to call forth all the endurance of the crew. At sea, everything
	    had to give way to the work in hand. If the vessel did not look pretty,
	    we concluded that we could not help it, and complacently looked forward
	    to a higher standard on our arrival in port. It was generally understood
	    and appreciated by all on board that mistakes through carelessness ought
	    not to be tolerated, and that strictness should rule always in matters immediately
	    connected with the special purpose of our party. In port, on the contrary,
	    the fullest liberty of action, not at variance with good order and the interests
	    of the work, was allowed.&rdquo; In Deep Sea Sounding and Dredging: A Description

	  <p>&quot;My familiarity with the successful use of very long steel ropes for

	  <p><strong>1888 - Alexander Agassiz on Ocean Temperatures</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;A great objection to the use of Miller-Casella [a maximum - minimum
	    recording thermometer] for obtaining deep-sea temperatures is found in the
	    fact that they will register only the lowest temperatures observed.....When,
	    however, we seek to ascertain the temperatures of the Gulf Stream, or to
	    work in the Arctic regions, where the coldest water may be nearest the surface,
	    we are unable, of course, to determine the position of the coldest or warmest
	    intermediate layers of water. The only perfect method of taking serial temperatures
	    is one which records them continuously on deck during the descent of the
	    thermometer. Such an apparatus has been devised by Sir William Siemens.
	    In the Bakerian Lecture for 1871, he showed that the principle of the variation
	    with the temperature of the electrical resistance of a conductor might be
	    applied to the construction of a thermometer, which would be in use in cases
	    where a mercurial thermometer was not available. The instrument he described
	    has since been largely used as a pyrometer for determining the temperatures
	    of hot blasts and smelting furnaces; and it has been found that its indications
	    agree very closely with those of an air-thermometer. He devised a similar
	    instrument for measuring temperatures where a much greater degree of accuracy
	    is required, as in the case of deep sea observations; and during the autumn
	    of 1881, this deep-sea electric thermometer was subjected to a series of
	    tests on board the Blake by Commander Bartlett.&rdquo; In Three Cruises

	  <p><strong>1888 - The Working Atmosphere on the Blake</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;It is pleasant to notice that the harmony between the naturalists
	    and officers of the &ldquo;Blake&rdquo; was not for an instant disturbed
	    during the time they were working in common. Everything in the way of naval
	    routine was sacrificed for the time to the objects of the cruise, and the
	    appearance of the deck and bow of the Blake was often more that of a mud-scow

      Device</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Depth determinations by means of reflected sound from the bottom
	    are reported to be feasible; andthough it may never supplant the standard
	    method of sounding, there is a possibility of it becoming a valuable supplementary
	    device.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Mapping the Pacific - Survey of Shoreline and Coastal
	    Waters&rdquo; by Commander J.T. Watkins, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

	  <p><strong>1926 - The Contribution of Steam Power to Oceanography</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Before steam came in to enable the mariner to keep his ship over
	    one spot it was quite impossible to take an accurate sounding over 100 fathoms.
	    The Challenger had moderate steam power, but was not fitted with the excellent
	    sounding engines and wire line of the present day. She used Italian hemp,
	    which, as it carried air down in its interstices, went slower and slower
	    and marked the great depths badly....&rdquo;</p>
	  <p>&quot;The weights on the hemp line were so heavy that they were slipped
	    each time and left at the bottom, and it is possible that in future geological
	    ages they will be recorded as meteorites that have come from other worlds
	    or from cosmic space.&rdquo; In Nature Notes for Ocean Voyagers (1926) by

	  <p><strong>1932 - Sailing by the Wind</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Walking aft a few feet we stand at the steering gear of the ship.
	    There is no cozy; wheel-house on the bridge for the quartermaster of a sailing
	    ship! He must stand at the very stern, with an unobstructed view of the
	    sails. When sailing &ldquo;by the wind&rdquo; his eye is glued to the weather-side
	    of the uppermost sail; he keeps it drawing a trace of wind, but never lets
	    it fill.&rdquo; In The Last Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by J. H. Paul.

	  <p><strong>1932 - Storms and Too Much Equipment</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;.... On the next day we had the worst storm of the passage. We were
	    forced to heave to and ride it out. Several of the bronze fittings in the
	    rigging were carried away. However, damage was not so serious that emergency
	    repairs could not be made. The vessel was having a bad time of it. Time
	    and again seas swept the quarter-deck, something which rarely occurred on
	    previous cruises. This was probably due to the load carried aft. The new
	    winch, generators, batteries, and so on, used for our oceanographic work,
	    weighed several tons.&rdquo; In The Last Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by

	  <p><strong>1932 - Hypothesis vs. Reality</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;There was one great surprise in the results. All of those who discussed
	    the project in its early stages questioned whether radio acoustic work would
	    be successful on the northwest Pacific Coast of the United States on account
	    of heavy surf noise interfering with the signals and the difficulties of
	    installing shore stations and cables, while it was taken for granted that
	    no difficulty would be encountered on the Atlantic Coast. The exact opposite
	    proved the case and it is only recently in the course of the Georges Bank
	    work that use under Atlantic Coast conditions has proven practicable.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Beginnings
	    of Acoustic Work in the Coast and Geodetic Survey&rdquo; by N.H. Heck, in &ldquo;Association
	    of Field Engineers U. S. Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey Bulletin,&rdquo; June
	    1932, No. 5, p. 48.</p>
	  <p><strong>1939 - Progress in Mapping the Seafloor</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Surveys of water areas, usually called hydrographic surveys, have
	    one large handicap not encountered in land surveying -- namely, the sea,
	    lake, or river bed is usually invisible to the surveyor. This is, perhaps,
	    the main reason why hydrographic surveys are so fascinating. In addition
	    to the interesting problems connected with routine tasks - seamanship, handling
	    of observations, and computations - there is always the anticipation of
	    finding some new and unsuspected feature of the sea bottom. In conducting
	    echo sounding surveys there is the additional attraction of being able to
	    observe the continuous variations in ocean bed topography as the surveying
	    vessel steams along on the sea surface sometimes a thousand fathoms or more
	    above the land being mapped. &ldquo;To a casual observer on a modern surveying
	    ship that is obtaining echo soundings, and is being controlled in position
	    by radio-acoustic ranging, the whole process might appear remarkably simple.
	    But to the engineers, both hydrographic and electrical, and the crews who
	    have contributed to the development and perfection of some of these methods
	    and applied them to the surveyors&rsquo; needs, it still seems almost incredible
	    that a system has been devised that is so practical as it is, a procedure
	    that permits the rapid accumulation of thousands of accurate soundings and
	    accurate positions of soundings in darkness, fog, or out of sight of visual
	    control. We look back on this development sometimes and wonder that it has
	    been made to work so well and realize that many of the most serious difficulties
	    have not been those of physics and engineering, but those involving skill
	    and experience in seamanship, and the knowledge and ability that come only
	    after long experience in dealing with the ever uncertain quantities -- weather
	    and waves. To the men of the crews, therefore, of the vessels of the Survey
	    must be given a large share of the credit for success in the &ldquo;sea
	    going&rdquo; use of methods and instruments usually not found outside a
	    physics laboratory.&rdquo; In &quot;Atlantic Submarine Valleys of the United
	    States and the Congo Submarine Valley&rdquo; by (1939) A.C. Veatch and P.

	    7). pp. 53-54.</p>
	  <p><strong>1939 - Methods, Errors, and Accuracy</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;... It is of the utmost importance in any study of these data to
	    have a thorough knowledge of the methods used, what probable errors to expect,
	    and the changing relative accuracy as certain improvements increase the
	    accuracy of the results from year to year; that is to say, one must acquire
	    at least a speaking acquaintance with many technical details that are second
	    nature to an experienced hydrographer.&rdquo; In &quot;Atlantic Submarine

	  <p><strong>1939 - The Role of Echo Sounding in Exploring the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Echo sounding has, indeed, opened an almost unlimited field in geology
	    and related earth sciences. Through it we shall be able to achieve extensive
	    and intensive exploration of the vast submerged areas of our planet that
	    hold so much of geologic history hidden under thousands of fathoms of sea.&rdquo; In &quot;Atlantic

	  <p>&quot;And thus we advance; what is adequate today may be inadequate tomorrow,
	    and, as better methods and equipment are perfected and demands for new facts
	    and knowledge are made, resurveys are periodically necessary. Surveys of
	    tomorrow doubtless will make those of today seem quite inadequate.&rdquo; In &quot;Atlantic

	  <p><strong>1955 - The Pioneer Survey II</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The Survey had developed a very effective radio navigation system
	    which could be installed along the coast to provide precise (within a hundred
	    feet) position information out to distances of a few hundred miles. Existence
	    of this system is basically what made the entire resulting operation, both
	    topographic and magnetic mapping, possible.&rdquo; This quote refers to
	    the Pioneer survey which was funded by the Navy for determining offshore
	    bathymetry on the west coast. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography funded
	    using the first shipboard towed magnetometer from the Pioneer. This convergence
	    of interests led to the discovery of magnetic striping on the sea floor,
	    a key element in formulating the theory of Plate Tectonics. In &ldquo;Some

	  <p><strong>1969 - The Need for Accurate Navigation</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;One of the problems that has plagued oceanography from its beginning
	    is the difficulty of establishing position above, on, and beneath the ocean
	    surface. The requirements for position accuracy differ from place to place
	    and from problem to problem. In the case of geophysical measurements on
	    the continental shelf, a precision of a few feet may be required, whereas
	    for certain biological measurements in the open ocean, an uncertainty of
	    several miles is acceptable. There are also studies, such as the measurement
	    of surface currents, where high relative precision, where the order of tens
	    of yards, is required, but where accurate knowledge of the absolute position
	    is unnecessary. Certain geophysical studies, such as gravity measurements,
	    also require precise navigation in order to determine the Eotvos correction....&rdquo; In

	    Academy of Sciences. p. 92.</p>
	  <p><strong>1969 - A Global Satellite Navigation System</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;.... An ideal [navigation] system would include the following characteristics:
	    global coverage, common geodetic datum, constant availability, unambiguity,
	    absolute accuracy of at least 200 m, capability of random access, self-monitoring,
	    relative simplicity at the sensor, capability of providing different ranges
	    of accuracy, and availability to infinite numbers of users. &ldquo;....It
	    would be a synchronous satellite -based system. With ground-tracking stations
	    located on a common geodetic datum, the spatial positioning of the satellite
	    could be well determined and monitored. The system should be global ....&rdquo; In

	  <p><strong>1980 - Wisdom in Using What Works</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;... when the opportunity arises one should take whatever proven techniques
	    he has and go to sea. Waiting for the ultimate system to be available can
	    lead to indefinite delays and no new science &ndash; the better system can
	    always be used on the next expedition.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Some Origins and
