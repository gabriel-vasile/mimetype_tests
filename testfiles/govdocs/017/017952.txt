ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
     

ADDITIONAL  MONETARY  RELIEF  AWARDED  AGAINST  MARLEN  JOHNSON  IN  CONTEMPT
PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH VIOLATIONS OF AN AGREED FINAL JUDGMENT

     After  ordering  defendant Marlen V. Johnson's arrest and incarceration,
     United  States District Judge A. Joe Fish has assessed civil  penalties,
     fines  and  attorney's fees in excess of $290,000  against  Johnson  for
     conduct  in contempt of a final judgment signed by Judge Fish  in  1996.
     On Dec. 9, 2002, Judge Fish signed an Order Setting Additional Fines and
     Setting  Amount  of  Attorneys' Fees to be Paid  by  Marlen  V.  Johnson
     Pursuant to Order of Contempt (December 9 Order).  The December 9  Order
     supplements  the  Order Holding Defendant Marlen  V.  Johnson  in  Civil
     Contempt for Failure to Comply with Court Orders, Granting Sanctions for
     Contempt  and Granting Other Post-Judgment Relief, entered by the  Court
     on Sept. 24, 2002 (September 24 Order) [see LR 17750/Sept. 26, 2002].
     
     Both  the  September 24 Order and December 9 Order arise from  Johnson's
     violations  of  the terms of an Agreed Final Judgment entered  by  Judge
     Fish  on  April 7, 1996 (SEC v. Jeffrey C. Hays, Marlen V. Johnson,  and
     James M. Nilsson, USDC/NDTX [Dallas Division], Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-
     0250-G).  The final judgment, entered in a matter charging Johnson  with
     masterminding a stock-manipulation scheme, barred Johnson from acting as
     an  officer or director.  The judgment also permanently enjoined Johnson
     from,  among  other  things,  future violations  of  the  antifraud  and
     reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.
     
      Judge Fish found that Johnson violated the final judgment from at least
     Oct. 19, 2001, to the present by acting as an officer and director of  a
     public  company,  including, but not limited to,  Voyager  Group,  Inc.,
     Neoteric,  Inc.,  and R&RX Group, Inc.  Judge Fish  further  found  that
     Johnson  violated the antifraud and reporting provisions  of  the  final
     judgment by causing reports to be filed with the Commission that omitted
     to  disclose  material information.  Specifically, Forms 10-K  and  10-Q
     that  Johnson signed and filed on behalf of Voyager and Neoteric  failed
     to  disclose  that Johnson, while acting as president, secretary  and  a
     director  of  these  companies, was nonetheless  subject  to  the  final
     judgment  barring him from acting as an officer or director.   Moreover,
     Johnson  failed  to  disclose any portion of  the  1996  final  judgment
     against him.
     
     Johnson  ignored the Court's initial order to show cause and  failed  to
     appear  at  a  contempt hearing held by Judge Fish on  Sept.  24,  2002.
     Pursuant  to  the September 24 Order, Judge Fish issued a bench  warrant
     requiring  the  arrest  and incarceration of  Johnson  and  ordered  the
     assessment  of  daily  coercive fines until Johnson  purged  himself  of
     contempt.   Additionally,  the  Court  required  Johnson  to   pay   the
     Commission  attorney's fees for the time expended in seeking to  enforce
     Johnson's  compliance  with  the final  judgment.   Finally,  the  Court
     imposed  on  Johnson  a third-tier civil penalty  of  $120,000  for  his
     failure  to  disclose  his  disciplinary history  in  filings  with  the
     Commission.

     After  Johnson  was arrested and incarcerated, the Court held  a  second
     show  cause  hearing.   Following this hearing, Judge  Fish  issued  the
     December  9  Order, awarding the Commission additional  monetary  relief
     against Johnson.  The Court set the amount of the coercive fines against
     Johnson  at  $120,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the Commission's
     request  for attorneys' fees in the amount of $50,975.  [SEC v.  Jeffrey
     C. Hays, Marlen V. Johnson, and James M. Nilsson, Civil Action No. 3:95-
     CV-0250-G, USDC, ND TX] (LR-17941)

FINAL  JUDGMENT  SETTING  DISGORGEMENT AND IMPOSING CIVIL  PENALTIES  AGAINST
PRINCIPALS OF A BOCA RATON COMPANY

     The  Commission  announced that on Jan. 10 the  United  States  District
     Court  for  the  Southern District of Florida entered a  Final  Judgment
     Setting  Disgorgement  and  Imposing Civil Penalties  (Final  Judgment),
     against  Defendants  Ulrich  Garbe, Peggy  Patterson  and  John  Hyland,
     formerly   principals  of  Sunstate  FX,  Inc.  (Sunstate),  a   company
     purportedly  in  the  business of trading foreign currency.   The  Final
     Judgment orders Garbe to pay $710,287.96 in disgorgement,  $76,712.75 in
     prejudgment  interest  and a civil penalty of  $120,000.   Patterson  is
     ordered  to  pay $228,374.09 in disgorgement, $24,665.93 in  prejudgment
     interest  and  a  civil penalty of $60,000.  Hyland is  ordered  to  pay
     $124,670.24  in  disgorgement, prejudgment interest  in  the  amount  of
     $13,464.667  and  a civil penalty of $60,000.  The Final  Judgment  also
     provides  for the dismissal of disgorgement and civil penalties  against
     Sunstate as the company is no longer in operation.
     
     The  Court  had previously entered, with the defendants' consent,  Final
     Judgments  of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Judgments)  on  the
     following dates: Sunstate on July 10, 2001, Patterson on July 26,  2001,
     Hyland  on  Oct.  18, 2001, and Garbe on Feb. 26, 2002.   The  Judgments
     permanently  enjoin  Sunstate, Garbe and Hyland from violating  Sections
     5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of
     the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 (Exchange  Act)  and  Rule  10b-5
     thereunder.    The  Judgments further enjoins Patterson  from  violating
     Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
     
     On  April  18, 2001, the SEC filed an emergency action against Sunstate,
     Garbe,  Patterson, and Hyland seeking to enjoin them from continuing  to
     violate  the  federal securities laws in connection with their  ongoing,
     fraudulent,  unregistered offer and sale of securities.   The  complaint
     alleged that Sunstate had raised over $54 million from approximately 160
     investors,  but  that  only 20% of these funds were  actually  used  for
     foreign  currency  trading, and even these  funds  were  only  used  for
     trading  for  a few short months.  Instead, according to the  complaint,
     Garbe,  Patterson and Hyland misappropriated at least  $2.9  million  in
     investor  funds  for their own personal use, including the  purchase  of
     luxurious  homes,  cars  and other personal  items.   In  addition,  the
     complaint  alleged  that, unbeknownst to investors,  Sunstate  paid  its
     sales agents commissions totaling at least $10.6 million -- representing
     about  20% of the offering proceeds.  [SEC v. Sunstate FX Inc., et  al.,
     Case No. 01-8328-CIV-RYSKAMP (USDC/SD FL)] (LR-17942)
