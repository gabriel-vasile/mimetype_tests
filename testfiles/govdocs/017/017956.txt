1.	INTRODUCTION

The following represents an up-to-date bibliography of available research conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other organizations from the mid-1990s to 2005, as well as a brief overview of state legislative activity regarding wireless voice communications in vehicles.  Note that in many cases the research included in this bibliographical listing are pertinent to the general issue of distraction by virtue of: (1) the similarity of actions and demands related to using wireless communication and other distracting actions in which drivers engage; (2) the inclusion of other distracting tasks in research studies; and (3) the scope of legislation or discussions of liability.  

The published research presented in this bibliography was drawn from all available sources the authors could identify based on personal knowledge, a comprehensive review of the literature, contacts with experts in the field and searches on the internet.  In an effort to present an unbiased compilation, all published research studies were included regardless of their source or findings. The classification of research into source categories (i.e., type of source from which each citation is drawn) was made to facilitate access for the reader and does not reflect an indication of importance or relevance.  The five categories identified for the purpose of this bibliography include:  NHTSA, Journals, Conference Proceedings, Technical Reports, and Other Research/Sources.  Within each category references are ordered by year of publication and then alphabetically by author.

3.	OVERVIEW OF ACTIVITY AT THE STATE LEVEL

As reported by the National Conference of State Legislatures, few states specifically regulate wireless phone use in motor vehicles.  In particular (as of September 2004),
* As of November 1, 2001, New York prohibits drivers from talking on hand-held cell phones while driving.
* As of July 1, 2004, New Jersey prohibits drivers from talking on hand-held cell phones while driving, but this is only enforceable as a secondary traffic violation.
* The District of Columbia enacted a law in 2004 (effective July 1, 2004) that bans the use of hand-held phones (with certain restrictions) by all drivers, bans the use of any cell phones by novice drivers and school bus drivers, and also addresses distracted driving in general.
* In September 2004, California enacted a law (effective January 1, 2005) that makes it illegal to use a cellular phone while driving a school bus or other public-transit vehicle.
* California requires that rental cars with cellular telephones must include written operating instructions for safe use of the phone.
* Florida and Illinois allow cell phone use in the car as long as sound to both ears of the driver is not impaired.
* Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Tennessee have enacted legislation that prohibits the use of cell phones while operating a school bus.
* Delaware clarified that school bus drivers can use a radio or telephone device to make or receive calls for assistance.
* Massachusetts also requires that all drivers have at least one hand on the steering wheel at all times while using a cell phone.
* New Jersey enacted legislation in 2002 that prohibits the holder of a driver examination permit from using any interactive wireless device while operating a motor vehicle, with emergency use exceptions.
* Maine enacted legislation in 2003 that prohibits drivers with only an instruction permit from using a mobile telephone (a device used to access a wireless telephone service) while operating a motor vehicle.

In addition, 

* Delaware, Louisiana, Virginia, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia have approved resolutions to study the risks associated with cell phones and driving.
* New Jersey passed a measure to provide for data collection and also prohibits drivers with learner's permits from using a cell phone while driving.  
* Illinois allows the use of one-sided hands-free headsets with cell phones.  
* New Hampshire passed a comprehensive distracted driving law.
