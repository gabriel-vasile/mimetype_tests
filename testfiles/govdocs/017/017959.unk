NLS progress in digital technology to patrons, library

An accessible design for NLS Patrons
Accessibility is a hot-button issue in the world of consumer
products. Engineers consider the wide range of abilities and
limitations of consumers and incorporate accessible design
into their work‡as will the team that creates the new
digital talking-book (DTB) system for the National
Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped
(NLS), Library of Congress. 
   Involved from concept to handoff for production, the team
members are HumanWare, formerly VisuAide, a leader in DTB
technology; the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), the
largest organization of blind persons in the world, with
more than fifty thousand members; and the Trace Research and
Development Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a
specialist in accessible technology for the disabled. They
will assist Battelle, a leading technology innovation firm,
with the design and development of the digital talking-book
machine (DTBM).

Getting creative
"The creative input of our patrons is essential to designing
a digital talking-book system that best accommodates them,"
says Frank Kurt Cylke, director of NLS. "One of the ways
we'll identify the needs and wants of our patrons will be
through repeatedly testing the player design concepts with
focus groups of blind and physically handicapped users."
Other project highlights include creating multiple models of
the DTBM, observing how users interact with them, and
developing the player‡s software and hardware. Gilles Pepin
of HumanWare, will manage and coordinate subcontractor
activities. His team will also support Battelle with design
and engineering activities by sharing the results of earlier
tests, developing training materials, and testing the final
DTBM for overall performance. 
   The two-phase project will take thirty months to
complete. "The first phase consists of concept development,
design, and testing," says Pepin. "The collected information
will directly influence the design of the DTB player
prototypes at appropriate stages of development." During the
second phase, the player will be transferred for
manufacturing, and early DTBMs will be examined to make sure
they operate according to design.

Testing . . . one, two, eight
A series of eight usability test cycles will ensure that the
final player is acceptable to NLS patrons. The tests will
employ a combination of focus groups, fieldwork, and site
visits. Individuals will test different versions of the DTBM
in typical settings, be assigned operational tasks, and make
evaluations based on their interactions with the machine.
Testers will also make suggestions on the kinds of things
they want the machine to do.
   Most tests cycles will take two weeks from start to
finish. The results will guide the development process, as
each test is designed to extract specific information.
Initial tests will explore user needs; whereas later ones
will examine how users interact with different player
designs and test sound, navigation, and manipulation of the
DTBM. A few tests will be used to confirm that the player
meets with the regulatory standards for DTBs.
   Recognized for expertise in consumer product testing, NFB
and the Trace Center will administer usability tests to
select groups. The Trace Center will test individuals
selected from residential living centers for the elderly and
senior day centers. 
   "People who are older and those with multiple
disabilities are a large part of the talking-book user
population," says Gregg C. Vanderheiden, director of the
Trace Center. "Our work can help ensure that current users
will continue to be able to use talking books as they age,
and new patrons will also be able to enjoy DTBs."
   NFB will manage tests among blind and low-vision users,
primarily NLS patrons who match certain profiles for visual
ability, age, demographics, and level of exposure to
technology. They will also test the DTBM with library staff
and repair technicians.  "When a user population is
involved, they will come up with many things that engineers
don't even think of," said Dr. Marc Maurer, president of
NFB.  "Because if one believes that the target population
for the machine will have a fuller life because of the
machine; then the machine has to do what it's designed to
do."

Facing a new frontier: 
Talking-book machine transformation
For many years, NLS and the volunteer machine-repair groups
TelecomPioneers and GE Elfuns have partnered to keep
talking-book machines in top shape. With a whole new
technology in development for talking books and machines,
what does the future look like for this relationship?
   As the next generation of playback machines evolves, they
will still have their work cut out for them. Cassette
machines will be in use beyond 2008 when the new DTBMs are
introduced.
   The national organizations of volunteers have repaired
more than 1.8 million NLS machines and dedicated countless
hours in repair workshops around the country. Their efforts
save NLS more than $5 million each year.
   Last year alone, they repaired more than 127,000
machines. And with the promise of nearly one million new
digital machines, the expertise of the repair volunteers
will be needed.
   But this isn't the first time these organizations have
faced a challenge and won. In the past, the repair
volunteers invented special tools and solutions to repair
the specialized players.

Flash, May 2005, volume 1, issue 6

Paving a distribution highway for talking books
Just as cars need highways, books need distribution systems
to facilitate the journey from libraries to patrons. That is
why a distribution system study is a necessary step for the
National Library Service for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress, on the road toward
digital transformation. A study has been contracted to
ensure that the digital book
distribution process evolves in tandem with the creation of
the books, giving patrons high-quality service.
   "The digital transformation is an opportunity to enhance
talking-book technology and the reading experience," says
Frank Kurt Cylke, director of NLS. "The distribution study
will help us maximize the potential of the digital talking
book (DTB) to better serve patrons."
   For this project, NLS has contracted with experts in new
technology solutions. ManTech Advanced Systems International
will lead the effort, supported by two subcontractors:
Jerome Ducrest, an independent contractor, and Daniel Kind
of Wesley-Kind Associates. Having worked with NLS in the
past, the two are uniquely familiar with library operations.

Maximizing potential
Driven by thorough research, the two-phase study will take
roughly sixteen months to complete. The first phase will
involve evaluating three possible DTB distribution models
followed by the selection of the best overall choice. Once
NLS approves the recommended model, phase two will gear up.
The design of the new system and a multiyear transition plan
will be the focus of the second phase, expected to run
through the summer of 2006.
   "Our goal is to implement a system that maintains high-
quality service and is mutually beneficial to NLS,
libraries, and patrons," says Michael Moodie, NLS deputy
director. "An ideal solution would provide patrons with
personal service, localized librarian knowledge, and timely
book delivery. It would also ensure sufficient inventory to
meet patron requests and would save libraries and NLS
money."
   The three models under consideration include the current
system, which duplicates mass quantities of book titles and
stores them locally for easy access by librarians as they
fill loan requests; on-demand duplication, where a central
facility would copy DTBs as patrons request them; and a
hybrid model which combines mass circulation and on-demand
duplication. To make the right choice, NLS will use
evaluation criteria developed with input from the
contractors and the Digital Long-Term Planning Group, an NLS
committee that includes state, regional, and subregional
librarians as well as patrons.
   "This decision will impact the entire distribution
network‡duplication, circulation systems, data management,
and possibly even facilities," says Moodie. "It is important
that we consider the economic, operational, and human impact
of each model."


Seamless transition
Librarians and patrons will aid the process as part of the
Digital Long-Term Planning Group. At the end of the initial
phase, contractors will meet with the group, which includes
members of the National Federation of the Blind and the
American Council of the Blind, to review the recommended
scenario and to collect comments on system design. 
   "Depending on the distribution model selected,
contractors may also visit certain libraries to gather
information to assist the design process," says Jean M.
Moss, NLS digital projects coordinator. "Libraries that
employ special shelving schemes will be of special
interest."
   Development of the new design will underscore cooperation
and integration. The design must consider all aspects of DTB
distribution, including duplication, packaging,
shipping/receiving, shelving, and automated circulation
systems.
   If significant changes from the current system are
recommended, the contractor will develop a comprehensive
transition plan. Some key topics might be establishing
telecommunications systems, phasing out cassette book
circulation, and phasing in DTB systems. Another area to be
examined is the method for educating library patrons and
staff about the new distribution model.
   "A detailed transition plan is being developed to provide
a roadmap to the future," says Moss. "The plan will be
implemented over a period of years to give libraries time to
adapt to any necessary changes."

Spotlight on DTB distribution system
Mass duplication Book titles are copied in large batches
(approximately 1,000 copies) at NLS audiobook production
facilities before being sent to network libraries for
storage and circulation. An allotment system permits the
libraries to determine the number of copies received for a
new title. Each library receives at least one copy of each
new title but may request more to meet reader demand.

Duplication-on-demand When needed, DTBs would be produced at
a central duplication center operated by NLS contractors.
Librarians would receive patron requests and submit them to
the centers. Rather than storing physical copies of DTBs on
shelves, titles would be stored on digital servers and then
loaded onto flash-memory cartridges and mailed to patrons.

Hybrid This system combines mass duplication and
duplication-on-demand to meet reader demand. High-
circulation titles‡which account for about 20 percent of the
collection but perhaps 80 percent of total circulation‡would
be mass produced and distributed to libraries for loan to
patrons. Low-circulation titles‡comprising the balance of
the collection yet only a small percentage of
circulation‡would be duplicated on demand at distribution
centers. The hybrid system is predicated on Pareto's Law,
which indicates that for a given population of entities
associated with a given activity, a distinct minority of the
population accounts for a distinct majority of the activity.
