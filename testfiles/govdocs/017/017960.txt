ment to prove that the bribe affected or could have
affected the federal funds received by the agency.

STATEMENT

    Following a jury trial in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, petitioner
was convicted on one count of conspiring to conduct
or participate in the conduct of the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity
(RICO conspiracy), in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(d),
and two counts bribery by an agent of an entity re-
ceiving more than 10,000 in federal funds, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. 666(a)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. 2 (aiding and
abetting); he was acquitted on one count of racketeer-
ing, in violation of 18. U.S.C. 1962(c). Petitioner was
sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment, to be followed
by three years' supervised release; he also was fined
$5,000. The court of appeals affirmed.
    1. At the relevant times, petitioner was the Divi-
sional Chief for Detention of the Hidalgo County
Sheriff's Office.  His co-defendant, Brigido Mar-
molejo, Jr., was the Sheriff of Hidalgo County. 1
Marmolejo was responsible for the operation of the
Hidalgo County Jail, and petitioner was his second in
command at the Jail. Pet. App. 1-2; Tr. 48-52.
    The Hidalgo County Jail was built and improved
with an 850,000 federal grant issued pursuant to a
grant contract executed between the United States
Marshals Service and Hidalgo County in May 1984.
J.A. 31-40. Under that grant agreement, the County
agreed to house federal prisoners in the completed
facility. J.A. 35. The agreement between the federal
government and the County was authorized by 18
U.S.C. 4002, which establishes a federal program for
providing "suitable quarters for the safekeeping,

___________________(footnotes)

    1. Marmolejo is a respondent in this Court under this Court's
Rule 12.6 and has filed a brief supporting petitioner.

care, and subsistence" of persons held in custody
under federal law.
    A secondary agreement between the Marshals Ser-
vice and the Count y, executed by Sheriff Marmolejo
on behalf of the County,  established specific provi-
sions for the County's housing of federal prisoners,
including the compensation to be paid to the County.
See J.A. 41-52.  Under that agreement, it was esti-
mated that the federal government would pay the
County approximately 915,000 annually for housing
federal prisoners. J.A. 43.
    The Hidalgo County Jail did not permit conjugal
visits. During most visits, the inmate was separated
from his visitors by a glass partition.  The Jail also
allowed one 30-minute family contact visit during a
prisoner's incarceration (additional contact visits
might be permitted at the discretion of Jail officials in
special cases, such as a death in the family).  Contact
visits took place in the attorney visiting room, the
booking area, or the detention squad room, and were
subject to observation by guards.  Under the Jail's
policy, if an ordinary contact visit became too physi-
cally intimate, the guards, after a warning, would ter-
minate the visit. See Tr. 61-62, 76-78, 119-121, 767-769,
797.
     2. Homero Beltran-Aguirre (Beltran) was a federal
prisoner housed in the Hidalgo County Jail pursuant
to the County's agreement with the federal govern-
ment.  Beltran was transferred to the Jail on June 7,
1991, and remained there until April 14, 1992, when he
was transferred to another facility.  Beltran returned
to the Jail on November 6, 1992, and remained there
until April 26, 1993.  Pet. App. 2.
    In August or September 1991, Beltran agreed to pay
Marmolejo a series of bribes in exchange for conjugal

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

4

visits at the Hidalgo County Jail. Beltran agreed to
pay Marmolejo a fixed rate of 6,000 per month for
weekly visits with his wife, and also to pay 1,000 for
each such visit. Beltran also paid for intimate contact
visits with his girlfriend on at least five occasions.
The visits occurred two days a week during the period
in which Beltran was incarcerated at the Jail.  See
Tr. 140-141, 143-148, 218-219, 233, 253, 273-274, 476,
502-503,547,910-914.
Several of the visits occurred in Sheriff Mar-
molejo's office.  On a few occasions, petitioner stood
outside the office supervising the visits. Tr. 231, 253,
502-503, 544.  Marmolejo also told Beltran's brother-
in-law, Juan Antonio Guardado, who arranged for
some of the payments, that whenever the Sheriff was
unavailable, petitioner should be contacted about the
conjugal visits.  Tr. 253, 502-503, 547.
In January 1992, Beltran instructed Guardado to
purchase four pairs of Rado watches.  The watches
cost Beltran approximately 8,500.  Beltran and Guar-
dado gave petitioner and Marmolejo each a pair of
watches, and told petitioner to give another pair to
Captain Andres Alaniz, which he did.  On another
occasion, Guardado gave petitioner a 1984 Chevrolet
Silverado pickup, valued at 3,000-4,000.  See Tr. 235-
237,497-501,561,756.
3. The RICO conspiracy count of the indictment,
Count 2, alleged that  ''each defendant agreed that two
or more of the acts of racketeering activity, as
specified in paragraph 7 of Count One, * * * would be
committed in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise."  J.A. 89.  The alleged pattern of rack-
eteering activity consisted of 14 state felony bribery
offenses, in violation of Texas Penal Code, Section

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

5

36.02(a). 2.  There was no allegation that each defendant
agreed personally to commit two racketeering acts.
At trial, petitioner requested an instruction that,
in order to find him guilty of RICO conspiracy, the
jury was required to find that he agreed personally to
commit two racketeering acts.  Although the gov-
ernment did not object to that proposed charge, the
district court rejected it.  The court stated that the
case should be submitted to the jury under "classic
conspiracy law" (J.A. 116):  "As long as I tell them
that he has to know that the object of the conspiracy
is running the enterprise with a pattern of racke-
teering, involving more than two acts, knowing that,
did he then, at some point, join in to participate in
assisting that conspiracy to be run. It seems to me
that's classic conspiracy law with RICO." Ibid.; see
also J.A. 109-111.  Accordingly, the court instructed
the jury as follows:

    So what the government has to prove is that the
    two of these gentlemen reached an agreement with
    each other that they were going to run the
    Sheriff's Office through a pattern of racketeering
    acts, that they were going to run the Sheriff's
    Office through a system of collecting bribes from
    one of these prisoners in return for doing favors
    for him, and that each of the defendants knew that

    2  That Texas offense provides that a person commits a
second-degree  felony punishable by up to 20 years' imprison-
ment if "he intentionally or knowingly * * * accepts * * *
from another: (1) any benefit as consideration for the recipi-
ent's * * * exercise of discretion as a public servant."  Tex.             
Penal Code Ann.  36.02(a) (West 1994); see id.  36.02(e)
(designating the offense as second-degree felony);  id.  12.33(a)
(defining punishment for second-degree felony).

    that was the idea and that each of them willfully
    joined in.
J.A. 137-138.             
    4. A divided panel of the court of appeals affirmed
petitioner's convictions.  Pet. App. 1-47.  Judge Jolly
dissented with respect to the bribery convictions. Id.
at 37-47.
    a. The court first rejected petitioner's contention
that his acceptance of bribes did not fall within the
reach of 18 U.S.C. 666 because the County Jail had not
received "[f]ederal assistance" exceeding $10,000 in a
year.  Petitioner contended that the federal funds
received by the County pursuant to its contract with
the Marshals Service to house prisoners were simply
payments for services rendered, and therefore were
not "[f]ederal assistance" within the meaning of the
statute.  The court noted, however, that the con-
tract to house prisoners was "interrelated" with the
federal government's grant of funds to the County
for jail construction, since, "[a]s a condition to the
receipt of this grant, Hidalgo County Jail had to
guarantee that it would provide detention space for
federal prisoners."  Pet. App. 6-7.  Accordingly, the
court concluded that the grant agreement and the
contract, together, constituted "[f]ederal assistance"
or a "[f]ederal program" within the meaning of Sec-
tion 666(b).  Pet.  App. 7.
    The court also concluded that, even with respect to
the contract payments alone, petitioner's argument
that the funds for housing prisoners were not
"[f]ederal assistance" must fail.  The court noted that
the purpose of  Section 666 is to protect the integrity
of federal programs for which there is a "specific
statutory scheme authorizing the Federal assistance

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

7

in order to promote or achieve certain policy objec-
tives." Pet. App. 8 (quoting  S. Rep. No. 225, 98th
Cong., 1st Sess. 371 (1983)).  To determine whether
federal funds were "[f]ederal assistance:  the court
therefore asked  "whether the funds disbursed [could]
be considered Federal assistance within a specific
scheme intended to promote public policy objectives
and not payments by the government as a commercial
entity." Ibid.  Because the funds provided by the
federal government in this case were intended to
fulfill the government's policy of providing for the
safekeeping and care of prisoners in federal custody,
it was irrelevant, the court concluded, that the gov-
ernment received something in return for the assis-
tance it provided to the County.  Ibid.
    b. The court also rejected petitioner's argument
that permitting Beltran to have conjugal visits in the
County Jail was not a transaction involving "any-
thing of value of 5,000 or more," as required by Sec-
tion 666(a)(l)(B).  The court noted, first, that under
circuit precedent, Section 666(a)(l)(B) "does not re-
quire the government to prove that federal funds
were directly involved in a bribery transaction, or
that the federal monies funded the corrupt trans-
action."  Pet. App. 10-11.  It also noted that the phrase
(anything of value " is " broad in scope and contains no
language restricting its application to transactions
involving money, goods, or services."  Id. at 11
(emphasis added).  The court therefore concluded that
the phrase includes "transactions involving intangi-
ble items, such as the conjugal visits at issue in this
case." Ibid. "Because the conduct in this case in-
volves serious acts of bribery by agents of a local
government who were carrying out their duties under
a Federal program," the court stated, "this case is

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

8

within the scope of conduct Congress intended to
encompass within 18 U.S.C. 666. " Id. at 14.
    The court observed further that "[t]he transactions
involved something of value-conjugal visits that
Beltran was willing to pay for."  Pet. App. 16.
Because Beltran was willing to pay more than 5,000
to obtain conjugal visits, the court held that the visits
had a value of more than 5,000.  The court reached
that conclusion "in the same way an appraiser would
value an asset-by looking at how much a person in
the market would be willing to pay for [the visits]."
Id. at 17-18.
    c. The court further rejected petitioner's conten-
tion that the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct
the jury that, to find petitioner guilty of RICO con-
spiracy,  it was required to find that he agreed
personally to commit two predicate acts of racketeer-
ing. Pet. App. 21-26.  The court reasoned that nothing
in the language of the RICO conspiracy provision, 18
U.S.C. 1962(d), "indicates that Congress intended to
do anything more than to criminalize a conspirato-
rial objective-the violation of a substantive RICO
provision." Pet. App. 24.  To accept petitioner's
argument that RICO conspiracy contains a special
element of agreement personally to commit an offense
"would be a marked departure from traditional
conspiracy law for which there is no support in the
language of the statute or the legislative history."
Id. at 25.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

    I. Petitioner's conviction satisfied all the ele-
ments of the offense of bribery under 18 U.S.C.
666(a)(l)(B).  The evidence established, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that petitioner was an agent of an

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

9

agency of local government, the Hidalgo County
Sheriff's Office; that the Sheriff's Office received
more than $10,000 in a year in federal assistance; that
petitioner corruptly accepted, or aided and abetted the
acceptance of, bribes from Beltran in return for a
transaction of the Sheriff's Office (allowing Beltran
to have conjugal visits at the Jail); and that those
conjugal visits were something of value worth at least
$5,000.  The government was not required to show, in
addition, that the transactions (the conjugal visits)
involved the disbursement or affected the integrity of
federal funds.
    The text of the statute does not require the govern-
ment to prove that a bribe made unlawful under Sec-
tion 666(a)(l)(B) affected or could have affected federal
funds.  The statute expressly prohibits bribe-taking
in connection with "any * * * transaction" of the
agency, reaching broadly to cover any transaction of
any kind whatsoever, as long as the transaction
involves a matter worth at least 5,000.  Congress did
not limit the statute to transactions shown in a
particular case  to involve or affect federal funds.
    The legislative history of Section 666 also provides
no basis for the limited construction suggested by
petitioner.  That history suggests, at most, that Con-
gress was particularly concerned about bribery that
would affect the integrity of federal funds.  It does not
indicate, however, that Congress intended to limit the
offense to cases where a threat to federal funds was
established at trial as an element of the offense.  Cer-
tainly the legislative history does not compel that
conclusion to the extraordinary degree that would be
necessary to disregard the plain language of the
statute.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

10

    Section 666(a)(l)(B) is a valid exercise of Con-
gress's spending power.  Under the spending power,
Congress may attach reasonable conditions to the
receipt of federal funds by local governmental enti-
ties. In Section 666, Congress has required that
officials of local governments receiving federal funds
adhere to high standards of integrity, even if those
officials do not themselves disburse federal funds.
Those officials may, as in this case, be responsible for
administering a federal program, and their corrupt
activities may jeopardize the attainment of the federal
program's ends.  More generally, Congress was en-
titled to conclude that agencies receiving federal
money must be free of significant corruption, since an
agency with problems of corruption in the imple-
mentation of state and local affairs might also be
untrustworthy in handling federal monies or imple-
menting a federal program.
    II. Petitioner's conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1962(d)
for conspiracy to violate the RICO statute also is
valid.  The district court properly instructed the jury
that it could find petitioner guilty if it found that he
had agreed with his co-conspirators that they would
operate an enterprise (the Sheriff's Office) through a
pattern of racketeering acts (the collection of bribes
from a prisoner), including at least two acts of rack-
eteering.  The jury was not required to find also that
petitioner agreed to commit two acts of racketeering
personally.
    Under traditional principles of conspiracy law, a
defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy upon
proof that he agreed with his co-conspirators that a
crime would be committed by some member of the
conspiracy.  There is no requirement that each con-
spirator agreed to commit the object crime personally.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

11

That rule follows from the nature of a conspiracy as a
partnership in crime, in which the partners act for
each other in their joint effort to commit offenses.
    Congress is presumed to adopt the settled mean-
ings of common law terms that it includes in statutes,
and so is presumed to have adopted settled aspects
of conspiracy law when it defined the offense of
conspiring to violate RICO.  The RICO conspiracy
statute, 18 U.S.C. 1962(d), makes it an offense to
conspire to violate a substantive provision of RICO.
Section 1962(d) does not alter the nature of a con-
spiracy by adding any new requirement that the de-
fendant agree personally to commit the predicate acts
of racketeering.
    That construction of the RICO conspiracy offense
serves Congress's overarching objective in RICO of
combating organized crime.  A principal practical
difficulty with prosecuting leaders of organized-crime
operations has always been that such leaders insulate
themselves from the actual commission of offenses.  A
requirement that conspirators be shown to have
agreed to commit two acts of racketeering personally
could inhibit the government's ability to prosecute
members of organized-crime operations who agree
and lend assistance to the commission of crimes
through an enterprise but who do not commit the
crimes themselves.  And requiring proof of agreement
to commit the predicate crimes personally is not
necessary to preserve the elements of the object
RICO violation involving Section 1962(c), namely,
that an enterprise exist, that the predicate crimes
constitute a pattern, and that the racketeers conduct
or participate in the conduct of the enterprise.  To
be guilty of such a conspiracy to violate RICO, one
must not merely agree to the commission of two

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

12

racketeering crimes; one must agree to the conduct
of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering crimes.  Thus, the government must
show that the co-conspirators anticipated the pursuit
of ongoing, related criminal activity through a for-
mal or informal arrangement with an ascertainable
structure.

ARGUMENT

I. PETITIONER'S CONVICTION SATISFIED ALL
   THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENSE UNDER
   18 U.S.C. 666(a)(l)(B)

    Petitioner was convicted on two counts of violating
18 U.S.C. 666(a)(l)(B).  Section 666(a)(l)(B) provides,
in pertinent part:

(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in
subsection (b) of this section exists -

(1) being an agent of an organization, or of
a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or
any agency thereof -

*****

(B) corruptly solicits or demands for
the benefit of any person of any person, or
accepts or agrees to accept, anything of
value from any person, intending to be
influenced or rewarded in connection with
any business, transaction, or series of
transactions of such organization, gov-
ernment, or agency involving anything of
value of 5,000 or more;

*****

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

13

     shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
     more than 10 years, or both.

The "circumstance described in subsection (b)"
referred to in the first clause of Section 666(a)(l)(B)
is that "the organization, government, or agency
receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of
$10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant,
contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or
other form of Federal assistance." 18 U.S.C. 666(b).
     Accordingly, to obtain a conviction under Section
666(a)(l)(B), the government must show (as relevant
here) that (1) the defendant was an agent of an agency
of local government (2) the defendant's agency re-
ceived more than 10,000 in a year in federal assis-
tance; (3) the defendant corruptly accepted something
of value intending to be influenced in connection with
transactions of his agency; and (4) the transactions of
the agency influenced by the corrupt payment in-
volved something worth at least 5,000.  All of those
elements were proven beyond a reasonable doubt at
petitioner's trial.  The statute establishes no further
elements of the offense.
    Petitioner contends nonetheless (Pet. Br. 5-24) that
his conduct was not encompassed by Section 666,.
Primarily, petitioner argues that Section 666 re-
quired the government to prove at trial that his
acceptance of a bribe had, or could have had, an impact
on federal funds.  There is no such requirement in the
statute, nor should one be implied.
    Petitioner also argues (Pet. Br. 15-23) that the
government did not establish either (1) that the
Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office received 10,000 in
annual "benefits" under a federal program or (2) that
he was an agent of an agency of local government.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

14

Neither contention is fairly included in the questions
on which the Court granted review, and, in any event,
both claims are incorrect.

    A. Section 666 Does Not Contain An Implicit
        Requirement That A Bribe Must Affect Federal
        Funds

    Petitioner does not contest that he corruptly
accepted, and aided and abetted Sheriff Marmolejo's
acceptance of, bribes in exchange for Beltran's
conjugal visits, or that permitting those conjugal
visits were transactions of the Sheriff's Office within
the meaning of Section 666.  He also does not contest
that those conjugal visits, for which Beltran paid
6,000 per month and 1,000 per visit, constituted
"anything of value of 5,000 or more."  He argues,
however (Pet. Br. 6), that  Section 666 requires that
the 5,000 transaction influenced by the bribe be
shown to be a matter that affects the disbursement or
integrity of the federal funds received by the local
government agency.  That contention is without any
basis in the statute.  3.

    3  All the courts of appeals that have addressed the precise
issue presented here have rejected the contention that the
bribe-taking must be shown to have an impact on federal funds.

Cir. 1996), petition for cert. pending, No. 96-1346; United

    1. Section 666 contains no language requiring a
showing that a bribe directly or indirectly affect fed-
eral funds. Rather, what Section 666 requires is that
the bribe be in connection with "any business, trans-
action, or series of transactions of [an] organiza-
tion, government, or agency" that itself receives fed-
eral funds. 18 U.S.C. 666(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added)!

meaning, that is, `one or some indiscriminately of
whatever kind.'" United States v. Gonzales, 117 S.

prosecution of corruption that was not shown in some way to
touch upon federal funds," held that the corruption must
involve a transaction valued at 5,000 or more from the
perspective of the entity that receives the federal financial
assistance.  That construction also has no basis in the text of
Section 666.  The statute flatly prohibits corrupt acceptance of
bribes by an agent of a recipient of federal funds to influence a
transaction of the recipient  "involving anything of value of
$5,000 or more";  it does not require that the thing of value
be measured by its worth to the recipient of the funds rather
than the bribe giver.  The $5,000 requirement represents a
congressional determination that corruption in transactions of
a magnitude of $5,000 or more itself poses a threat to the
integrity of federal funds and programs.  The Foley court's
extra-textual limitation on the statute would effectively im-
munize corrupt transactions involving payments of $5,000 or
more for government benefits that are difficult to value from
the perspective of the government, such as licenses, exemp-
tions, approvals, and numerous other regulatory actions.  The
restriction is thus unfounded.
    4. Likewise, the theft offense defined by Section 666(a)(l)(A)
requires only that the property stolen have a value of  5,000 or
more and be under the custody or control of the organization
receiving the requisite $10,000 in federal funds.  There is no
requirement that the $5,000 stolen have any connection with
the federal funds.  All that is required is that the property
have a connection with the organization receiving federal
funds.

Ct. 1032, 1035 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 97 (1976)). Congress did
not include a limiting phrase such as "involving
federal funds" or "in connection with federal funds,"
although it easily might have done so if there had
been an intention to so limit the statute.  See United
States v. Westmoreland, 841 F.2d 572, 576 (5th Cir.)
(Section 666 "contains nothing to indicate that `any
transaction involving $5,000' means `any federally
funded transaction involving $5,000' or `any trans-
action involving $5,000 of federal funds,' and other
subsections of the statute contain no inconsistent
provisions that might suggest such a qualification"),
cert. denied, 488 U.S. 820 (1988).  The purpose of
omitting such a limitation is evident rather than
adopting a cumbersome requirement of tracing fed-
eral dollars to particular corrupt activities, Section
666, as drafted, "allow[ed] Congress to ensure the
integrity of federal funds by protecting the integrity
of the organizations that receive them."  Pet. App. 16.
Accordingly, "any transaction" must be given its
plain meaning;  there is no requirement that it be a
transaction involving or implicating federal funds.
    Petitioner contends (Pet. Br. 11-15) that Section
666 contains no "clear statement" that it is to be
applied to bribery of state officials, and that such a
clear statement is required by Gregory v. Ashcroft,
501 U.S. 452 (1991), and McNally  v. United States, 483
U.S. 350 (1987).  That contention is plainly incorrect.
Section 666 by its express terms prohibits acceptance
of bribes by anyone who is an "agent of * * * a State,
local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency
thereof." 18 U.S.C. 666(a)(l).  No further language is
necessary to make clear that Section 666 applies to

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

17

corruption of local officials who are agents of recipi-
ents of federal funds, whether or not federal funds are
involved in the corrupt transaction.
    2. In contending that Congress intended to reach
corrupt bribe-taking only when shown to pose a
threat to the federal funds received by recipients of
grant assistance, petitioner relies on the legislative
history of  Section 666.  But there is no basis here for
adding a significant limitation to the scope of a clear
criminal prohibition on the theory that the limiting
principle may be found in the legislative history.  See
Gonzales, 117 S. Ct. at 1035 ("Given the straight-
forward statutory command, there is no reason to
resort to legislative history.").  As we have explained,
the text of Section 666 is plain and evinces no limi-
tation of the offense to bribe-taking that is proven to
endanger federal funds.
    Even if a truly compelling showing based in the
legislative history could justify a departure from the
statutory language in this case, the legislative
history of  Section 666 does not yield the "extra-
ordinary showing" that would be necessary to con-
clude that Congress intended to enact the restricted
reading of the statute put forward by petitioner
rather than the plain meaning of the text. Cf. United
States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985); National
Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S.
249, 261 (1994).  The Senate Judiciary Committee
Report accompanying Section 666 explained that the
statute was enacted in part because of uncertainty
about the reach of 18 U.S.C. 201, which prohibits
corrupt bribery of "any public official," including any
"person acting for or on behalf of the United States,"
18 U.S.C. 201(a).  See S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st
Sess. 369-370 (1983).  At the time that Section 666 was

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

18

enacted, the courts of appeals were divided as to
whether Section 201(a) applied to state officials and
employees of private entities that had not contracted
directly with the federal government.  That uncer-
tainty was eventually resolved by this Court in
Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S. 482, 499 (1984),
which held that a person employed by a state gov-
ernment or private organization may be a "public
official" within the meaning of Section 201, if he or
she "possess[es] some degree of official responsibility
for carrying out a federal program or policy." The
Senate Report indicated that Congress wanted the
new Section 666 to reach at least as far as lower court
decisions that, at the time, had construed Section 201
to cover persons who had not entered into a direct
contractual relation with the federal government, but
who had responsibility for administering  federal
programs.  See S. Rep. No. 225, at 370 & nn.2, 3 (dis-
cussing court of appeals cases).
    Rather than amend Section 201 or draw on lan-
guage in an earlier proposed bill that expressly re-
quired a link between the bribe and a federal pro-
gram, 5. however, Congress created an entirely "new
           
___________________(footnotes)    

    5  The Committee Report indicated that Section 666 was
"derived" from a bribery provision in an earlier, unenacted
proposed comprehensive revision of Title 18. S. Rep. No. 225,
at 369 & n.l;  see S. Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 802-804
(1981).  That earlier provision would have defined a federal
offense of  "commercial bribery" where the defendant was an
agent or fiduciary of  "an organization charged by Federal
statute, or by a regulation issued pursuant thereto, with
administering monies or property derived from a Federal
program, and if the recipient's conduct is related to the
administration of such program." Id. at 803; see S. 1630, 97th
Cong., 1st Sess.  1751(c)(1)(I) (1981).  In Section 666, however,
Congress enacted no condition that the conduct be "related

19

offense[ ]" (S. Rep. No. 225, at 369) with a different
scope from that of Section 201.  Whereas Section 201
reaches bribery by anyone who implements a federal
program, regardless of the value of the transaction
affected by the bribe or the amount of federal assis-
tance received by the bribe-taker's organization, Sec-
tion 666 reaches corrupt bribery whether or not the
agent is exercising "official responsibility for carry-
ing out a federal program or policy" (Dixson, 465 U.S.
at 499), but only if the agent is associated with a
recipient of 10,000 or more annually of federal assis-
tance, and only if the bribe involves a transaction of
the agency worth at least  5,000.
    The Senate Report stated that Section 666 should
be construed broadly, to achieve its purpose of pro-
tecting funds distributed through federal programs
from bribery, fraud, and theft. S. Rep. No. 225, at 370.
The Report did not suggest, however, that the statute
should be construed to achieve only that purpose.
Congress evidently believed that recipients of signifi-
cant federal assistance should be held to the high-
est standards of integrity, and that any significant
corrupt transaction by an agent of those recipients,
whether or not the corruption directly endangers fed-
eral funds, triggers federal concern.  That view is
reasonable; a state or local official who engages in
corrupt bribe-taking with respect to state monies and
transactions might well do the same with respect to a
transaction involving federal funds.

to the administration of " the program receiving federal

requirement.

    While the Senate Report suggests that Congress's
main purpose in enacting Section 666 was to protect
funds distributed through federal programs, it does
not support the claim that Congress intended to
require prosecutors to show in each case that the
corrupt transactions impaired federal funds.  The
unqualified language used by Congress in Section 666
leaves no room for any such argument.  Evidence that
some members of Congress had particular fact pat-
terns in mind when they recommended the enactment
of Section 666 provides no basis for limiting the
application of the statute to those particular factual
scenarios.   See Albertini, 472 U.S. at 681-682 (noting
that, although congressional debates suggested that
the primary purpose of 18 U.S.C. 1382 was to punish
spies and panderers for repeated entry into military
installations, the text of the statute was not limited
to such persons and did not preclude application to
political protesters); Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrez Co.,
473 U.S. 479, 500 (1985) (declining to create "rack-
eteering injury" requirement to RICO civil action
when such requirement did not exist in text of
statute, even while recognizing that RICO "is evolv-
ing to something quite different from the original
conception of its enactors").
    3. Petitioner and amicus NACDL suggest that,
unless Section 666 is narrowly construed to reach
only acts of bribery that affect federal funds, it
exceeds Congress's legislative authority under the
Constitution. See Pet. Br. 14-15; NACDL Br. 23-29.
That argument is without merit.  Section 666 is a
valid exercise of Congress's spending power under
Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, which authorizes Con-
gress to "provide for the common Defense and general
Welfare of the United States."  Section 666 ensures

that States and local governmental units that accept
federal financial assistance exceeding $10,000 in a
year will adhere to high standards of integrity, and
requires that they act through agents who do not
abuse their positions of public trust by corruptly
accepting bribes in conducting official business.  The
requirement that officials whose agencies administer
significant federal program funds refrain from accept-
ing bribes in any substantial transaction (whether or
not it involves the federal funds) is a reasonable and
appropriate method of ensuring the integrity of the
administration of the federal funds.
    "Incident to [its spending] power, Congress may
attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and
has repeatedly employed the power `to further broad
policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal
moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal
statutory and administrative directives.'"  South
Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987) (quoting
Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 474 (1980)
(opinion of Burger, C.J.)).  Moreover, Congress may
permissibly accomplish objectives through the use of
the spending power even if those objectives are "not
thought to be within Article I's `enumerated legisla-
tive fields'" such as the Commerce Clause power.  Id.
at 207 (quoting United States  v. Butler,  297 U.S. 1, 65
(1936)). "The offer of benefits to a state by the United
States dependent upon cooperation by the state with
federal plans, assumedly for the general welfare, is
not unusual."  Oklahoma v. Civil  Service Comm'n,
330 U.S. 127,144 (1947).
    The spending power is subject to three "general"
restrictions, Dole, 483 U.S. at 207, all of which are
met here.  First, the spending must be for the
"general welfare," a matter to which substantial

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

22

deference is given to the judgment of Congress. See
ibid.; Helvering  v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619,640-641 (1937).
This case, however, does not involve any challenge
to the propriety of the expenditures authorized
by Congress (as was true in Helvering v. Davis)
but rather to the conditions placed on that spending.
In any event,  no deference is required to see the
prudence of requiring high standards of integrity at
agencies involved in administering federally funded
programs.
    The second limitation is that the condition on the
receipt of federal funds must be clearly stated,
"enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice know-
ingly, cognizant of  the consequences of their partici-
pation." Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (quoting Pennhurst
State School & Hospital  v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17
(1981)).  The prohibition on bribery in Section 666 is
stated expressly on the face of the statute. And the
prohibition may permissibly fall on the employee even
though it is the governmental agency that receives
the funds. In Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commis-
sion, supra, the Court upheld, as a valid exercise of
authority under the spending power, federal restric-
tions on partisan political activities by state employ-
ees whose employment was connected to any activity
financed  in whole or part by federal  funds.  330 U.S. at
143-144.
    Third, the Court has suggested that "conditions on
federal grants might be illegitimate if they are
unrelated `to the federal interest in particular na-
tional projects or programs.'" Dole, 483 U.S. at 207
(quoting Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U.S.
444, 461 (1978) (plurality opinion)).  Here, there is a
reasonable relationship between the condition im-
posed on the federal funds-insisting that those who

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

23

work for local agencies that receive substantial fed-
eral program funds  do not engage in corruption-and
the purpose of the condition-protecting the integrity
of the administration of those federal programs. Cf.
New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 172-173
(1992) (finding a "reasonable relationship" between
"milestones" required to be accomplished by States in
disposal of radioactive waste and payments to States
from surcharges on such waste, to be made only if
States achieved those milestones).  It was reasonable
for Congress to insist that all personnel of agencies
handling federal funds adhere to high standards of
integrity, whether or not they are directly involved in
implementing federal programs or disbursing federal
funds.
    In this case, of course, the law enforcement officials
who engaged in corrupt activity "were in charge of
carrying out the Federal program of housing and
safekeeping the federal prisoners, including [the
bribe-payer] Beltran, at Hidalgo County Jail." Pet.
App. 15-16.  Their corrupt activities thus undermined
the very federal program for which federal monies
were being paid to the local agency.  But Congress
could reasonably conclude that an agency with a
problem of corrupt employees handling state or local
affairs might also fail the requisite standard of
integrity when implementing federal policies.  Thus,
Congress could reasonably insist that a local agency
that receives significant federal assistance be free of
corruption entirely.
    This is not a ease in which the conditions imposed
on receipt of federal funds in Section 666 "pass the
point at which pressure turns into compulsion."  Dole,
483 U.S. at 211 (internal citation omitted). In this
case, Hidalgo County was free to refuse the federal

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

24

financial assistance that it received in building the
County Jail. Nor was the County compelled to enter
into a contract to house federal prisoners.  While
presumably the County agreed to do so because it
obtained a benefit in obtaining the federal per diem
reimbursements, there is no indication that those
benefits were anything more than a "relatively mild
encouragement," ibid., to cooperate with the federal
government.  Moreover, the agreements with the
Marshals Service did not compel the County to alter
any local policy with respect to public corruption in
order to conform to federal requirements; bribery is
contrary to the law of Texas as well as the United
States. See Tex. Penal Code Ann,  36.02(a) (West
1994).  Accordingly, Section 666(a)(l)(B) does not
exceed Congress's spending power. 6.
    4. Finally, petitioner (Pet. Br. 13) and amicus
NACDL (Br. 11-12) rely on the rule of lenity.  That
rule applies only in a case of statutory ambiguity,
where the Court "can make no more than a guess as
to what Congress intended." United  States v. Wells,
117 S. Ct. 921, 931 (1997) (internal quotation marks
omitted).  Here, the text of the statute is unqualified,
and to the extent that the legislative history may be
relevant, cf. Gonzales, 117 S. Ct. at 1035, that history
discloses no basis for engrafting on Section 666 a
requirement that the bribe must be shown to affect
federal funds. Accordingly, "this is not a case of

power may be invalid if it contravenes some "independent
constitutional bar" such as the Eighth Amendment, see Dole,

this case.

at 931.

B. Petitioner Was An Agent Of A Local Government
    Agency That Received More Than 10,000 In A
    Year Of Federal Program Benefits

    Petitioner contends that two explicit elements of
the offense under Section 666(a)(l)(B) were rot
satisfied.  First, he argues (Pet. Br. 15-20) that the
Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office did not receive
10,000 in annual "benefits" under a "Federal pro-
gram" within the meaning of the statute, because the
payments made by the United States Marshals
Service to Hidalgo County for the housing of federal
prisoners like Beltran were merely payments for
services rendered, and not programmatic assistance.
Second, he argues (Pet. Br. 20-23) that he was not an
agent of local government because the Sheriff's
Office for which he worked was not a local govern-
ment agency.  Neither of those arguments is fairly
included within the questions on which this Court
granted review, and neither is therefore properly
before the Court. See Yee v. City of  Escondido, 503
U.S. 519, 533 (1992). 7. Both contentions are in any
event without merit.
    1. Petitioner was unquestionably an agent of an
agency of local government, the Hidalgo County
Sheriff's Office. Although petitioner argues that the
Sheriff's Office is not a local governmental agency
because it is independent of the County, the evidence

___________________(footnotes)

    7  In particular, petitioner's contention that the federal
funds were merely payments for services rendered is an
attempt to argue the first question presented in the petition for
a writ of certiorari, which this Court excluded from its grant
of review. See Pet. i;  J.A. 167.

26

at trial showed that Sheriff Marmolejo signed the
contract to house federal prisoners on behalf of
Hidalgo County. See J.A. 43, 45-46.  Furthermore,
Section 666 reaches all local governmental agencies
of any kind; Section 666(d) defines a "government
agency" to include "a subdivision of the executive,
legislative, judicial, or other branch of government,
including a department, independent establishment,
commission, administration, authority, board, and
bureau." 18 U.S.C. 666(d)(2) (emphasis added).
    2. The Sheriff's Office received more than 10,000
under a "Federal program involving a grant, con-
tract, * * * or other form of Federal assistance"
during the relevant periods.  The Cooperative Agree-
ment Plan (CAP) (J.A. 31-40) provided for a federal
grant to the County for construction at the Jail; that
grant was conditioned-on the County's agreement to
house federal prisoners at the Jail in exchange for
their costs (J.A. 35), which agreement was later me-
morialized in the Intergovernmental Service Agree-
ment (IGA) signed by Sheriff Marmolejo (J.A. 41-52).
Pursuant to the CAP and IGA, the federal govern-
ment paid the Sheriff's Office about 70,000 per month
for prisoner housing during the relevant period, an
amount far exceeding the jurisdictional prerequisite
of 10,000 in federal funding per year.  See Tr. 1121-
1122, 1126, 1137.
    Petitioner argues that the federal payments for
prisoner housing were not "[f]ederal assistance" be-
cause they were merely payments for commercial
services rendered by the County Jail.  He relies (Pet.
Br. 18-19) on a statement in the legislative history of
Section 666 to the effect that "not every federal
contract or disbursement of funds would be covered"
by Section  666. S. Rep. No. 225, at 370.  The Senate

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

27

Report indicates, however, that disbursements of
funds under federal contracts are covered by Section
666 as long as they are pursuant to a "[f]ederal
program,"  which the Report explained to mean "that
there must exist a specific statutory scheme author-
izing the Federal assistance in order to promote or
achieve certain policy objectives." Ibid. See United
States v. Rooney, 986 F.2d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 1993) ("The
inquiry is not whether there is a quid pro quo, but,
rather, whether the funds disbursed can be considered
Federal assistance within a specific statutory scheme
`intended to promote public policy objectives and not
payment by the government as a commercial entity.").
    In this case, there is a "specific statutory scheme"
under which the CAP and IGA were entered into, and
under which the Jail received the federal payments
for housing federal prisoners.  The CAP and IGA
were executed under 18 U.S.C. 4002, which authorizes
the Attorney General to enter into contracts with
state and local authorities to arrange for "suitable
quarters for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of
all persons held under authority of any enactment of
Congress." The CAP, which was "predicated upon
the Federal government's requirement for detention
space and services and the local government's pro-
vision of such services," provided for "Federal partici-
pation in the funding of local governmental jail con-
struction, renovation or improvement programs."
J.A. 32.  In effect, the CAP and IGA were part of a fed-
erally funded jail construction and operation program,
and although title to the County Jail remained in the
hands of the local government, one of the major
purposes of federal funding of the Jail was to pro-
vide space needed for the federal government's own
inmates when their presence was required in the

area. Accordingly, under the terms of Section 666,
the Sheriff's Office received, within the relevant
periods, "benefits in excess of 10,000 under a Federal
program involving a grant, contract, * * * or other
form of  Federal assistance.""

II. THE RICO CONSPIRACY STATUTE, 18
     U.S.C. 1962(d), DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT
     THE DEFENDANT AGREE PERSONALLY TO
     COMMIT ANY PREDICATE ACTS OF
     RACKETEERING

    The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organiza-
tions Act (RICO) makes it a crime to conduct, or
participate in the conduct of, the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. 1962(c).  A "pattern of racketeering activ-
ity" requires "at least two acts of racketeering
activity" within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. 1961(5).
"[R]acketeering activity" covers various offenses,
including state felony offenses involving bribery.  18
U.S.C. 1961(1).  The RICO statute also punishes, as a
separate crime, conspiring to conduct the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. 1962(d).
    In this case, petitioner and his co-conspirators
were charged with conspiring to conduct the affairs of
the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office (the enterprise)
through two or more acts of bribery, constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity.  See J.A. 89.  The
conspiracy count did not charge that any of the four
conspirators agreed personally to commit two
racketeering acts; rather, it alleged (and the jury
found) that petitioner agreed "that two or more acts
of racketeering activity * * * would be committed in
the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise."  Ibid.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

29

Petitioner contends that, to be guilty of RICO
conspiracy, a defendant must agree to engage in the
pattern of racketeering personally, and that it is not
sufficient that he agree to the commission of the
predicate acts by a member of the conspiracy.  That
proposed rule is contrary to traditional principles of
conspiracy law, and there is no indication in the
RICO statute that Congress intended to impose such
a novel and strict requirement of proof in order to
convict RICO conspirators.
    1 "A conspiracy is a partnership in crime."
Pinkerton  v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 644 (1946).
"The gist of the crime of conspiracy * * * is the
agreement or confederation of the conspirators to
commit one or more unlawful acts." Braverman  v.
United States, 317 U.S. 49, 53 (1942) (discussing
predecessor to 18 U.S.C. 371).  Under traditional
principles of conspiracy law, there is no requirement
that any of the conspirators agree personally to
commit the substantive offense that is the objective of
the confederation; unless the particular conspiracy
statute requires the commission of an overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy, all the government
must show to prove conspiracy is that the defendant
entered into an agreement with the objective of
violating one or more criminal statutes.  See United
States  v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 13-14 (1994); Braver-
man, 317 U.S. at 53; United States v. Holte, 236 U.S.
140, 144 (1915).
    The absence of any requirement that a conspirator
agree personally to the commission of a substantive
offense stems from the fundamental point that "a
conspiracy to commit a crime is a different offense
from the crime that is the object of the conspiracy."
United States  v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 85 (1915).

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

30

Entering into a conspiracy is prohibited by law, not
merely because the conspirator has a desire or intent
that the law be violated, but because (among other
reasons), by entering into the arrangement to commit
a crime, the conspirator creates a greater danger that
the crime will in fact be committed by someone. See
Callanan  v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593 (1961).
In a conspiracy, "so long as the partnership in crime
continues, the partners act for each other in carrying
it forward." Pinkerton, 328 U.S. at 646. Thus, one
may be guilty of conspiracy to commit an offense even
if he is incapable of committing the substantive
offense.  Rabinowich, 238 U.S. at 86; see Holte, 236
U.S. at 144-145.
    Nor is it necessary, for a conspiracy conviction,
that the conspirators have identified and come to
agreement on the precise details of their criminal
objectives.  As Judge Learned Hand cogently ex-
plained, "a party to a conspiracy need not know the
identity, or even the number, of his confederates;
when he embarks upon a criminal venture of indefi-
nite outline, he takes his chances as to its content and
membership, so be it that they fall within the common
purposes as he understands them." United States v.
Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503, 507 (2d Cir. 1944); see also
Johnson v. United States, 62 F.2d 32, 33 (9th Cir.
1932). "The fact that the defendants may not have
known all the particulars of the total scope of a
conspiracy does not bar a conviction." United States
v. Bastone, 526 F.2d 971, 981 (2d Cir. 1975), cert.
denied, 425 U.S. 973 (1976); see also Jones v. City of
Chicago, 856 F.2d 985, 992 (7th Cir. 1988) (Posner, J.)
("It is enough if you understand the general objec-
tives of the scheme, accept them, and agree, either

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

31

explicitly or implicitly, to do your part to further
them.").
    Accordingly, one who agrees to assist in accom-
plishing the essential objective of an illegal scheme
is guilty of conspiracy, whether or not he agrees
personally to commit the substantive offense that is
the object.  See Pinkerton, 328 U.S. at 645-647; Blue
v. United States, 138 F.2d 351, 360 (6th Cir. 1943),
cert. denied, 322 U.S. 736 (1944). 8.  In keeping with that
rule, this Court has upheld conspiracy convictions as
supported by sufficient evidence, even though the
defendant did not participate directly in the com-
mission of the object offense and was not charged
with agreeing to do so.  In Direct Sales Co. v. United
States, 319 U.S. 703 (1943), the Court upheld the con-
spiracy conviction of a drug wholesaler who supplied
drugs to a physician with knowledge that the physi-
cian was distributing them unlawfully, even though
the wholesaler did not personally violate the sub-
stantive law; the Court regarded it as sufficient that
the wholesaler intended to further the physician's
criminal objective. Id. at 713.  In Rabinowich, the

___________________(footnotes)

    8 That principle is related to the principle that conspirators
may be punished for any reasonably foreseeable substantive
offense committed by their co-conspirators in furtherance of
the conspiracy's objective.  Pinkerton, 328 U.S. at 647.  The
rule that conspirators are accountable for each other's acts in
furtherance of the conspiracy was recognized at common law.
See, e.g., Collins v. Commonwealth, 3 Serg. & Rawle 220, 223,
226 (Pa. 1817); Commonwealth v. Warren, 6 Mass. 74 (1809);
B.F. Pollack, Common Law Conspiracy,  35 Gee. LJ. 328, 334
(1947).  That principle also serves as the theoretical foundation
for Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d)(2)(E), which makes the
statement of one conspirator during and in furtherance of the
conspiracy admissible against all his co-conspirators.  See Fed.
R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) advisory committee's note.

Thus, a RICO conspiracy offense is established if
there is an agreement among the conspirators to
conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity, which includes the agree-
ment that the conspirators, as a group, will commit
two or more racketeering acts constituting such a
pattern. 9.
    Petitioner's reading of Section 1962(d) to require
proof of an agreement to commit personally two
predicate acts of racketeering `would require "a
degree of involvement in the affairs of the conspiracy
that is not required in any other type of conspiracy,
where agreeing to a prescribed objective is suffi-
cient."  United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F.2d 489,498
(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 939,940 (1986).  Peti-
tioner's argument would require this Court to con-
clude that Congress, in enacting Section 1962(d), had
created a wholly  "new form" of conspiracy at odds
with traditional conspiracy doctrine.  Id. at 497.
There is no basis in the language or history of the
statute to suggest that Congress had such an inten-
tion.  Instead of creating a new law of conspiracy,
RICO merely created a new objective for traditional

    9 There is therefore no merit to the argument of amicus
NACDL (Br. 10-11) that a conspirator's agreement to conduct
the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity, in violation of RICO, means an agreement to conduct
such affairs personally. NACDL starts from the premise that,
even under the common law, "a conspiracy requires[] the
individual's agreement to violate the substantive offense." Br.
10.  But as we have explained, a conspiracy as traditionally
understood does not require the individual's agreement to
violate the offense personally, but rather his joining a group
that collectively agrees and intends to violate the substantive
offense.

35

conspiracy law-a violation of Section 1962(a), (b),
or (c).   Ibid.
    Petitioner suggests (Pet. Br. 27-28) that Congress,
in enacting RICO, intended to incorporate a rule
adopted in a sentencing provision of the same omnibus
anti-crime legislation, which directed enhanced sen-
tencing for a dangerous special offender who com-
mitted a felony in furtherance of a conspiracy to
engage in a pattern of criminal conduct, and who did,
or agreed that he would, manage or supervise the
affairs of the conspiracy.  See 18 U.S.C. 3575(e)(3)
(1970) (repealed).  From that sentencing provision,
petitioner argues that Congress, in the RICO con-
spiracy provision, also adopted a rule that the
defendant must have intended personally to conduct
the affairs of the racketeering enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity.  The former Section
3575(e)(3), however, is irrelevant to the issue before
the Court in this case.  The Court has in the past
looked to that sentencing provision to inform RICO's
definition of a "pattern" of racketeering activity,
since the special-offender provision specifically de-
fined the term "pattern" to require that criminal acts
be related to one another.  See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n.14 (1985); H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239-240
(1989).  But see H. J., 492 U.S. at 240 (noting that
special-offender provision was "of no assistance" in
explaining pattern element requiring continuing
racketeering activity, because it did not address
continuity). "Pattern," however, is a term without a
settled common law meaning.  This case concerns the
"meaning of "conspire: and that word had an extensive
judicial gloss when Congress enacted RICO.  There
is no indication in the omnibus 1970 crime legislation

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

36

that Congress intended the courts to look anywhere
other than well-settled principles of conspiracy law in
giving meaning to that term.
    3. Amicus NACDL argues (Br. 18-23) that a rule
requiring proof of the defendant's agreement to
commit the predicate acts personally is necessary to
preserve requirements of the substantive RICO
offense defined in Section 1962(c)-such as the re-
quirement that the predicate acts of racketeering
constitute a "pattern" the requirement that an en-
tity identifiable as an "enterprise" be present, and the
element that a defendant must "conduct or parti-
cipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct" of the
enterprise.  That argument is without merit.  A con-
spiracy to violate RICO requires more than an agree-
ment that two acts of racketeering will be committed;
the conspiracy must involve an agreement among the
conspirators to conduct the affairs of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity.  See
Neapolitan, 791 F.2d at 496 n.3.  Thus, although the
conspirators may not, at the time of their agreement,
foresee all of the opportunities for criminal activity
that will eventually cross their path, they must
anticipate that the criminal association will "function
as a continuing unit,"  thus constituting an enterprise
(see United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583
(1981)), that the criminal acts will be related, thus
constituting a pattern (see H.J., 492 U.S. at 239), and
that at least one among them will manage or operate
the enterprise (see Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507
U.S. 170, 179 (1993)).  Those elements of the unlaw-
ful agreement eliminate any danger that a RICO

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

37

conspiracy defendant will be convicted merely on the
basis of "guilt by association" (see NACDL  Br. 22). 10.
    A personal-commission rule would, in fact, under-
mine the goals of conspiracy law generally and the
RICO statute in particular.  First, traditional princi-
ples of conspiracy law permit authorities to intervene
when the criminal agreement is formed, even when
"the object dimension * * * [is still] of indeterminate
scope." See Developments in the Law-Criminal
Conspiracy, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 919,930 (1959).  Assume,
for example, that a group of people agree to set up
an arson-for-hire ring to take advantage of future
criminal opportunities, but that they are discovered
before any definitive plans to carry out acts of arson
materialize.  Or assume that a group of corrupt
probate judges, court clerks, and estate lawyers agree
to use in the future the judges' power to appoint
personal representatives in return for kickbacks and
bribes, but that the conspirators are discovered early,
before any opportunities to engage in their corruption
arise, and that not every member of the conspiracy is
in a position either to give or to receive bribes.  In
both cases, the confederates have conspired among
themselves to conduct the affairs of an enterprise

    10 It is  therefore irrelevant  to this case that petitioner was
acquitted on one of the two predicate acts of racketeering with
which he was charged, and was therefore acquitted on the
substantive count of racketeering.  J.A. 143.  Because the jury
necessarily found that petitioner agreed to the conduct of the
affairs of the overall enterprise, the Hidalgo County Sheriff's
Office, through a pattern of bribes, he was properly convicted
of conspiracy, even though he was found to have personally
committed only one act of racketeering, bribery involving the
acceptance of two Rado watches from Beltran.  See J.A. 57.

they have not assigned definite roles in the enterprise
to every member of the conspiracy, and even if some
roles do not necessarily involve the personal com-
mission of racketeering acts.  Each case, like that
of  "Murder Incorporated[,]' would be a group con-
templating the commission of other than a definite
number of crimes" (ibid.) and would be punishable as a
conspiracy.
    Often, the government will not know which member
or members of a RICO conspiracy intends actually to
commit the object offense until the offense has been
committed; indeed, the conspirators themselves might
not decide until long after their initial agreement how
precisely they will go about achieving their criminal
goal.  Requiring the government to show not merely
that the defendant entered into an agreement having a
criminal object, but also that he personally agreed to
commit the object offense, would in many cases defeat
a principal purpose of  the conspiracy concept (both in
RICO and elsewhere)-to enable the government to
intervene before the illegal acts intended by a crimi-
nal collaboration actually occur.  See United States v.
Feola, 420 U.S. 671,694 (1975); Rabinowich, 238 U.S.
at 88; Developments in the Law-Criminal Con-
spiracy, supra, 72 Harv. L. Rev. at 924 ('When the
defendant has chosen to act in concert with others,
rather than to act alone, the point of justifiable
intervention is reached at an earlier stage.  In this
situation the reasons for which the law is reluctant
to intervene are considerably weaker."); Model Penal
Code and Commentaries, supra, at 388 (conspiracy
law properly permits "preventive intervention by the
agencies of law enforcement").
    Second, adherence to traditional conspiracy doc-
trine furthers Congress's major purpose in enacting

RICO, the eradication of organized crime. H. J., 492
U.S. at 245. A requirement that each member of a
RICO conspiracy agree to commit personally the
requisite predicate acts would undermine the con-
gressional objective of combating organized crime
because it would have the effect of exempting from .
, coverage those organized crime figures shrewd
enough to insulate themselves from the criminal acts
committed by their underlings. As two scholars in
the field of organized crime have observed
     The reason why most of the top leaders [of the
     Cosa Nostra] are able to live and flourish with-
     out going to jail is because they are carefully
     insulated from contact with crime.  That is,
     insulated from those criminals who get their
     hands dirty. Many of the criminal brass could
     take, and pass, a lie detector test during which
     they could deny having touched or seen a deck of
     heroin, been in a bookie joint, or [having] known
     any loansharks, extortionists or murderers in
     years.
R. Salerno & J. Tompkins, The Crime Federation:
Cosa Nostra and Allied Operations in Organized
Crime 156 (1969) (quoted in J. Minnis, Comment,
Clarifying RICO's Conspiracy Provision: Personal
Commitment Not Required, 62 Tul. L. Rev. 1399,
1412 n.80 (1988)); see also Permanent Subcomm. on
Investigations of the Senate Comm. on Government
Operations, Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in
Narcotics, S. Rep. No. 72, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 2
(1965) (convicting crime chieftains is "usually ex-
tremely difficult and sometimes is impossible, sim-
ply because the top-ranking criminal has taken the

utmost care to insulate himself from any apparent
physical connection with the crime"). 11.
    Congress reinforced the sweep of the RICO statute
by expressly directing that "[t]he provisions of this
Title [Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970] shall be liberally construed to effectuate
its remedial purposes."  Pub. L. No. 91-452,  904(a),
84 Stat. 947 (18 U.S.C. 1961 note).  In light of the
statute's purpose to eradicate organized crime, Con-
gress's "self-consciously expansive language and
overall approach," Sedima, 473 U.S. at 498, and the
congressional directive to construe the statute liber-
ally, there is no basis for narrowing Section 1962(d)
by imposing a personal-commission  requirement that
is foreign to traditional conspiracy law.  RICO's
liberal-construction clause "seeks to ensure that
Congress' intent is not frustrated by an overly
narrow reading of the statute." Reves, 507 U.S. at
183.  Petitioner's construction, by insulating some of

    11 Two pre-RICO cases-People v. Luciano, 14 N.E.2d 433
(N.Y. 1938), and United States v. Aviles, 274 F.2d 179 (2d
Cir.), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 974, 982 (1960)-illustrate the op-
erating style of many organized-crime chieftains.  In describing
a large-scale prostitution ring run by Charles "Lucky" Luciano,
the head of the New York syndicate in the late 1930s, the
Luciano opinion noted that Luciano himself "did not take an
active part in the daily operations of the business." 14 N.E.2d
at 434.  In Aviles, the court of appeals affirmed the narcotics
conspiracy conviction of Luciano's successor, Vito Genovese,
explaining "Although there is no proof that Vito Genovese
ever himself handled narcotics or received any money, it is
clear from what he said and from his presence at meetings of
the conspirators and places where they met and congregated
that he had a real interest and concern in the success of the
conspiracy." 274 F.2d at 188.

those who occupy the highest rungs of organized
crime, would have that unjustified effect.
    4. Petitioner and amicus NACDL make a number
of additional arguments in favor of reversal here, all
of which are without merit. First, petitioner argues
that the government conceded in the district court
that he could be convicted only if he were shown
to have agreed personally to commit two acts of
racketeering, and that this case was tried against him
under that theory. Pet. Br. 28-29. The prosecutor
explained to the district court, however, that, "[i]f he
[petitioner] generally knows what's going on, he
knows that these [racketeering acts] are happening,
then he would be liable." Tr. 1290-1291. The prosecu-
tor also agreed with the court's statement that "[the
defendant] doesn't necessarily have to know about
every particular act as long he's in the relationship,"
by responding, "Yes, sir. That he has knowledge that
it's going on. * * * A pattern that's occurring and
that he's willing and able to participate. He assists by
being available." Tr. 1291.  The district court clearly
ruled that the government did not have to prove that
petitioner agreed to commit two acts of racketeering
personally and instructed the jury on that basis in
accordance with that ruling, see J.A. 154-155, and the
government defended that ruling and instruction in
the court of appeals, see Gov't C.A. Br. 43-47. 12.

___________________(footnotes)

    12  Petitioner also argues (Pet. Br. 31-32) that the RICO
instructions given here would not have been valid in the
Eleventh Circuit, which arguably requires, in a "single objec-
tive" RICO case, that the defendant have agreed to commit
two racketeering acts personally.  Whether or not petitioner
might have prevailed on appeal had his case been brought in
the Eleventh Circuit, the correct rule, in our view, is that, in
every RICO conspiracy case, the defendant need only have

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

    Second, petitioner suggests (Pet. Br. 36) that
application of the RICO statute to state and local gov-
ernment officials  is contrary to Gregory  v.  Ashcroft,
501 U.S. 452 (1991), and McNally  v. United States, 483
U.S. 350 (1987), which he reads as requiring a clear
statement of congressional purpose to subject state
governmental entities to federal law.  That claim was
not presented in the petition for a writ of certiorari
and is not "fairly included" within the RICO question
on which review was granted, which is limited to
the personal-commission issue.  Accordingly, the
Court should not reach the issue.  See Yee v. City of
Escondido, 503 U.S. at 533.  In any event, this case is
unlike Gregory or McNally, for this case involves a
federal prosecution of a conspiracy to commit predi-
cate acts that are felonies, not federal preemption of
state policymaking authority in matters such as
"disclosure and good government for local and state
officials" (McNally, 483 U.S. at 360).  Furthermore, it
is well settled that a state governmental entity may
bean "enterprise" within the meaning of RICO. See
United States v. Angelilli, 660 F.2d 23, 31 (2d Cir.
1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 910, 945 (1982); United
States v. Thompson, 685 F.2d 993 (6th Cir.) (en banc),
cert. denied, 459 US. 1072 (1982).  An enterprise

___________________(footnotes)

agreed to the commission of racketeering acts by members of
the conspiracy, not necessarily himself. The Eleventh Circuit's
distinction of single-objective and multiple-objective RICO cases
in United States v. Carter, 721 F.2d 1514 (llth Cir.), cert.
denied, 469 U.S. 819 (1984), appears to have been based on an
effort to reconcile its own RICO conspiracy precedents, a task
that this Court need not undertake.  The Eleventh Circuit's
treatment of that point in Carter was thoroughly and con-
vincingly criticized by the Seventh Circuit in Neapolitan, 791
F.2d at  499 n.5.

under RICO may be "any entity''-in other words,
"anything that exists," including a state agency.
Angelilli, 660 F.2d at 31.
    Finally, petitioner argues that the racketeering
acts charged in the RICO conspiracy count-state
bribery offenses-are not predicate offenses because
they are not punishable by more than one year's
imprisonment under Texas law.  Pet. Br. 37-40.  That
argument, too, was not presented in the certiorari
petition and is not properly before the Court.  In any
event, the court of appeals properly rejected the
contention.  Pet. App. 19-20.  The predicate state-law
offense of bribery, Tex. Penal Code Ann.  36.02(a)
(West 1994), is not superseded by the misdemeanor
gratuity offense, id.  36.08(b), in cases like this one,
involving a bribe given as a quid pro quo for a benefit,
since the misdemeanor offense does not contain the
element of quid pro quo.  Pet. App. 20; Cerda v. State,
750 S.W.2d 925, 927 (Tex. Ct. App. 1988).  Section
36.02(a) does not contain any element that the person
offering a bribe must be in custody, and petitioner
was a "public servant" covered by the plain language
of the prohibitions of Section 36.02(a), since he
was "selected" or "appointed" as an "agent of gov-
ernment." Accordingly,  petitioner was properly con-
victed of RICO conspiracy.

from a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt in which such person
has participated as a principal within the meaning of
section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or

provides:

Federal prisoners in State institutions; employment

    For the purpose of providing suitable quarters for
the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons
held under authority of any enactment of Congress,
the Attorney General may contract, for a period not
exceeding three years, with the proper authorities of
any State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof,

The rates to be paid for the care and custody of said
persons shall take into consideration the character of
the quarters furnished, sanitary conditions, and
quality of subsistence and may be such as will permit
and encourage the proper authorities to provide rea-
sonably decent, sanitary, and healthful quarters and
subsistence for such persons.
