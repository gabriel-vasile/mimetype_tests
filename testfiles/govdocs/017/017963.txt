The validity of this report is questionable, as it was not reported in either the Roseburg Twice A Week Review or the Umpqua Valley News, both of which were published semi-weekly in Roseburg, OR.

"[The mainshock] was followed, after a short interval by another tremor which ... was not heavy enough to do any damage, while the third shock, following at a longer interval, was scarcely perceptible.  The last two shocks, in fact, seemed like a gentle readjustment of the earth, as though the first shock had seriously displaced it and it was 'shaking itself back into place.'"

"... During the day and until midnight slight shocks, to the number of twenty or more, kept our people in a state of nervous suspense.  A frisky one at 2:28 sent people running pell mell into the streets."
The daily version of the paper was printed in the morning, so the events discussed above must have occurred on Wednesday.  From the context, 2:28 is inferred to be in the afternoon.

This aftershock was apparently only reported from Avila Beach, which suggests that its location was near Avila Beach.  It is worth noting that Avila Beach is ~200 km SSE of San Juan Bautista, the southern limit of the mainshock rupture.  This distance is nearly equal to half the rupture length away from the rupture itself.

"At exactly three o'clock this morning occurred another earthquake, not so severe as the first one of Tuesday morning, but sufficiently shocking to awaken a large number of people and cause those who already had their eyes open to hike towards the open.  It is likely that some few panes of glass were broken and other minor damage done, which will be discovered by the good householders this morning.  That people's nerves are on edge regarding earthquakes in general is evidenced by the fact that when this tremor was felt, people began to appear on the streets in abbreviated attire and were soon discussing this late reminder of the recent catastrophe."
The "first one" referred to is almost certainly the mainshock of Wednesday morning, 18 Apr.

The remainder The Irvine & Muir Cos store which was partially demolished Wednesday morning has gone down as has also the rear walls of the McElroy building....
"These buildings were all one story bricks and had been damaged by former shocks.  The earthquakes commenced again last evening and two light shocks were felt.  At quarter of two this morning a heavy shock was felt and the one this afternoon completed the damage.  The one story wooden dwelling of C F Vincent was thrown from its foundations and overturned."
A note under the heading "An Explanation" on p. 4, c. 1-2 of the 27 Apr 1906 issue of the Ukiah Republican Press recants this report-it is not clear what part of the report, if any, is true and accurate:
"In an extra issued from this office Friday evening ... there was a misstatement in a communication from Willits which set forth that another earthquake had occurred at Willits and destroyed some of the buildings which had been injured in the first shocks....

Although the timing is a little off, this is inferred to be the event of the early morning of 23 Apr.  Even if it is not the same event as the earthquake felt across much of northern California on 23 Apr, this entry in the lighthouse log still provides some constraints: if the lighthouse keeper would bother to note a "slight" earthquake in his log, but he did not note a different earthquake about two hours later, the later earthquake (i.e., the event felt across much of northern California) must not have been strong enough to wake him.  If that is the case, the later event probably did not have an intensity (MMI) greater than IV.

Sam Luttrel was driving from Fort Jones with a load of Yreka passengers.  He met  a man about three miles out of Yreka driving to Fort Jones who told him that the earthquake had been very severe in Yreka, cracking the Masonic building from top to bottom and doing other material damage.

"Grants Pass, Or., April 23.-Severe earthquake shocks occurred here at 1 o'clock this morning.  The tremor continued for about 20 seconds, rattling windows and doors and stopping clocks.  People were awakened, many going out into the streets.  At the Hotel Josephine nearly all the guests awoke and came down into the lobby.  It was feared for a while that serious damage would result.
"Telephone reports from Crescent City, California, state that that place was severely shaken last night, as was Sisson and other northern California towns."

"Ever since the disastrous quake at 5:11 a. m. Wednesday [April 18], there have been innumerable shocks of more or less severity at intervals but none approaching the severity of the first.  One o[f] the heaviest of these occurred at 1:10 o'clock this morning and caused considerable consternation among the people owing to the length of time that the vibrations continued.  In fact the period was fully as long as that of the first shake of Wednesday.  However, besides rattling things about considerably, spilling liquids from open dishes, and stopping clocks, as far as learned there was no serious damage done about the city.  The only exciting incident appears to have been the breaking of a live electric wire in front of the Daly Bros. store at Fourth and F streets.  This did no damage however.
"One effect of the earthquake shock of early this morning was to cause a slide to come in on the Scotia road, which prevented the train from coming in from there with the overland mail this morning and delayed the arrival of the train from Alton about one hour."
What was called the Scotia road probably ran from Fortuna to the south, through Scotia.  Because the slide blocked the trains from both Scotia and Alton, the slide must have occurred north of Alton, which is between Scotia and Fortuna.  Hence the slide most likely occurred between Alton and Fortuna.  For several hundred meters north of Alton, the road and railroad tracks run along the base of an escarpment, and this seems to be the most likely location of the slide.
"The telephone wire was working spasmodically as far as Hydesville, and from there it was learned that no damage was done by this morning's earthquake.
"Telephonic communication with Ferndale was partially restored late this forenoon, when it was learned that the shock this morning did little or no damage there.  A few more bricks were knocked out of the walls of the Russ, Early & Williams wrecked brick store, a few movable articles about town were disturbed, and that was about all."

"As compared with the shock of last Wednesday morning, the quakes felt here yesterday morning did little or no damage.  A window pane here and there which had been cracked from the big temblor fell out, a few bricks which had become loosened on a number of chimneys about town tumbled down, putting the fear of the Almighty in the hearts of many, and the houses generally were shaken up, sufficiently to awaken the populace.  There were many who remained awake the remainder of the night and few of the more timid who sought the streets.
"The shock was felt at Ferndale, but comparatively no damage was done.  In fact it was felt by all the valley towns about the same as in Eureka.
"As nearly as can be learned the recent shake extended farther north than did the other, and it is reported that Arcata and the towns in the northern part of the county felt the thrill, and that Crescent City and Grants Pass got it stronger than ever before.  Even Portland is reported as getting shaken up, in the same manner as Eureka was Wednesday morning, perhaps not so seriously.
"The shock was felt at Yreka more severely than the Wednesday quake at that place.  At Redding it lasted eight seconds, and a few chimneys tumbled down, and there was a shirttail brigade.
"Locally [in Eureka] there were two shocks.  The first was at 1:10 a. m. , with vibrations from south to north and lasting 14 seconds.  The second was exactly at 6:07 a. m., with vibrations from southwest to northeast, and lasting four seconds."
From this article alone, it is not clear which of the two events were characterized by the effects described in the first two paragraphs, and which of the two events were felt as described in the locations mentioned in paragraphs three and four.  From other reports, however, it appears that the 01:10 shock was much the stronger, and it is consequently inferred that the first four paragraphs of the above article refer to the 01:10 shock and not the 06:07 shock.

"Guests in the Lorenz, Golden Eagle and Temple hotels were alarmed and a few came down into the office or out into the street, dressed only in their night clothing.  The electric clock in the Temple Hotel stopped at 1:10 a. m.  No other electric clocks in town were affected.
"The quake awakened people throughout Redding, but hundreds and hundreds of sleepers were not disturbed at all and first learned of the earthquake when they arose for the day.
"As compared with the shake-up of last Wednesday morning, the earthquake of yesterday morning is described by some as being sharper, while others insist that it was not so sharp.  Perhaps the happy mean is about the correct estimate and Monday's quiver was only a duplicate of that of last Wednesday.
"H. Bemis, who sleeps in the Gem Lodging-house, says he was awakened by a jerking motion of his bed.  The jerking ceased momentarily, but for a few seconds-perhaps eight or ten-the bed continued to tremble a little, and then came the last and final jerking, much sharper than the shake-up that had awakened him.  With that the event was over.  During the earthquake he could hear a tapping on the windows, perhaps caused by the rattling of the panes.  An open door somewhere in the house swung on its hinges, grinding out a noise something like 'hee-haw, hee-haw!'"

"Wild rumors flew along the wires this morning from the south of a reported disastrous earthquake throughout Oregon last night.  The Tidings was called up by phone from Redding to confirm a report that Ashland and Grants Pass had been damaged, but had to deny knowledge of any disturbance here, although some people reported a slight tremor at 1:10 o'clock this morning.  Others, including the telegraph operators who were on duty all night here, knew nothing of it.  The Grants Pass telephone office reported a slight tremor in that city and at Glendale and Merlin.  Redding, on the south, felt a slight tremor, and there was more or less seismic disturbance through California which disarranged the telegraph lines for an hour."

"A slight shock of Earthquake was felt by some people in Ashland at 1:10 Tuesday morning, also at Sisson, Hornbrook and other points in Siskiyou...."
Tuesday would be 24 Apr; later in the same article, however, the date is given as 23 Apr.  [The remainder of this article is listed chronologically in this catalog under 23 Apr, under (nearly) identical entries published in the Morning Oregonian (Portland).]  Because this source is internally inconsistent, and because the 01:10 time of the event matches the time of an event known to have occurred on 23 Apr (but not on 24 Apr), the obvious inference is that the date stated above ("Tuesday") is in error.  It should state the date as being Monday morning, 23 Apr.

"GRANTS PASS, Or., April 23.-(Special.)-An earthquake shock which broke some windows and awoke sleeping citizens was felt here at 1:11 this morning.  The shock lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and was accompanied by a distinct rumbling noise.  The motion of the undulation was from east to west and the oscillation was sufficient to set hanging lamps and pictures to swaying.
"Mayor George Good states that the shock was felt all over his house, which is a structure 75 feet in length and two stories high.  His children, who were asleep, were awakened and cried out in alarm, and a relative who was sleeping in an adjoining room, despite the fact that he is quite deaf, was aroused by the sway of electric light fixtures attached to the bed.
"Within a few minutes after the shock frightened citizens began calling up the local telephone exchange to ascertain the cause of the commotion.  The telephone manager had been raised by the shock and was able to allay the fears of all, as practically no damage had been done beyond the breaking of window glass."

"The people of Redding experienced another earthquake shock at 1:20 o'clock Monday morning.  In some sections of town the twister was felt more plainly than in others.  Many people slept through it all, not knowing of any disturbance until they awakened and were told of the affair by their neighbors, whose slumbers had been disturbed.
"The shock was accompanied by a rumbling noise similar to that made by a locomotive.  Many who felt the shock did not consider it of sufficient import to get out of bed, while others made hasty exits from their lodgings.
"Several guests at the Lorenz and Golden Eagle hotels were awakened but none were badly frightened.
"A stone and concrete fence on the north Liberty street premises of A. J. Martin ... was cracked in several places.
"The shake was felt as far north as Portland and Seattle and south in Oakland and San Francisco, though no damage was reported from any section in the state."
The last paragraph is almost certainly erroneous.  It is not corroborated in either the Oregon Daily Journal or the Morning Oregonian, both of which were published daily in Portland.

"But up on the hill back of the main street there was a lively shaking up of windows, dishes and furniture.
"Frank Talmadge, who lives on the hill section, says his house was severely wrenched and shaken.  The windows rattled, Talmadge's bed swayed perceptibly and he hastily telephoned down town to see how much damage was done.  Clocks were stopped in various parts of town.

The minor temblors, which are still coming and one of which occurred at an early hour yesterday morning, are merely the necessary movements of the earth in the process of adjustment....

"McAdie has found ... at the Eckart home, 3014 Clay street, a complete set of apparatus for just the work of his department.  At this address the Weather Bureau is now located, and will remain until other arrangements are made for it...."
The "Forecaster McAdie" mentioned in this article is Professor Alexander G. McAdie, who at the time of the 1906 earthquake was Meteorologist in Charge of the San Francisco office of the United States Weather Bureau.  In 1907, he published a catalog of earthquakes on the Pacific coast, covering the years 1897 to 1907.  It was published under the title Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, part of Volume XLIX, No. 1721.  More information can be found in the Preface and Introduction to the Townley and Allen (1939) catalog, pp. 1-13.
The events listed in this article are not listed as individual entries in this catalog because they are all listed in McAdie's catalog and again in Townley and Allen (1939).  It is not always clear which of these aftershocks were actually felt or which were only recorded instrumentally.
The times given in this article for all the aftershocks (except the last aftershock, at 7pm) were adjusted by McAdie before he published his catalog in 1907.  Each of the times listed in his catalog for these aftershocks is one minute later than it is in this article.

Many Oakland people were complaining today of smashed crockery and other slight damage resultant from the shock, but as a whole it occasioned no general alarm.

"If I had only known that there would not be any more earth-quakes I could just as well kept on at the Post Office and be making two dollars per day.

It scared me about as bad as the first one did, and I did not want to take any chances, every one that comes weakens the building that much more, and it looks now as if it would fall at any time...."
Although this event scared the writer "about as bad as the first one did," he also wrote in his diary, on 29 Apr 1906, that all the aftershocks put together "would hardly make as great a one as the first one was."

Durham (1998) identifies two locations named Mile Rocks, one in Sonoma County and the other in San Francisco County.  Looking at the maps in the atlas portion of Lawson (1908), the San Francisco County "Mile Rocks" location is on Maps 4, 17, and 19, whereas the Sonoma County location of that name is not on any of the maps.  The inference is made that "Mile Rocks" in the list of aftershocks in Lawson (1908) refers to the San Francisco County location.

"The shock of earthquake felt at 3:15 yesterday afternoon was No. 37 of the series in which is included the one responsible for starting the fire that caused the destruction of San Francisco.  It was a little less than three seconds in duration and would be rated as a number three.  Numbers one and two are not perceptible shocks, and can be observed only through the agency of seismic instruments.  These registered the earthquake that did all the damage in the city as a number nine.
"At the Chabot Observatory, Oakland, it was said today that the shock felt yesterday was much lighter than the average layman thought.
"'The people are now all tuned up for shocks,' said Professor Burckhalter, 'and they unconsciously exaggerate the dimensions of the slightest quake.  That of yesterday afternoon was of a significance hardly worth talking about.  Instruments are fortunately without nerves and have enabled us to be assured that it was incapable of any material consequence.'"
Also in the Oakland Herald of 26 Apr 1906, p. 2, c. 3-4.
It is not clear whether the statement in the first paragraph about it lasting three seconds and being "rated as a number three" describes the earthquake in San Francisco or Oakland.  By comparison to reports in the Oakland Enquirer (27 Apr) and The Bulletin (28 Apr), it appears as though all of this information came from Professor Burckhalter at Chabot Observatory in Oakland; still, there are minor inconsistencies between all three reports that are puzzling.
See Table 10.

"Professor Burckhalter of the Chabot Observatory states that the earthquake which occurred yesterday afternoon at fifteen minutes after 3 o'clock, was only a small one, in spite of the miniature panic it caused.  It lasted only two seconds, he says, and ordinarily would hardly be noticed.
"It was rumored that yesterday's shake was due to an extra large dynamite explosion in San Francisco.  Professor Burckhalter says that such was not the case, and that the dynamiting over there has no effect on the earth's crust over here."
Although the earthquake is stated to have occurred "yesterday," the report almost certainly refers to the earthquake at around 15:15 on 25 Apr; compare this with the report in The Bulletin (San Francisco), 26 Apr 1906, p. 6, c. 2-3.

"So far as has been learned the earthquake caused no damage in this section, although it is feared a number of the partially wrecked buildings in Oakland and San Francisco may have suffered.
"Occupants of the First National Bank building were not alarmed, a majority of them remaining in their offices.
"The earthquake was of several seconds duration.  Its direction appeared to be from south to north.  The officials at the University were unable to give a report of the earthquake this afternoon, but will be prepared to give a seismographic record of today's disturbance and the numerous recent temblors."

Many rushed from their homes bareheaded and into the streets, looking at each other with blanched faces, fearing a repetition of the shock of last week.  Practically no damage was done, only a few loose bricks toppling from their shaky positions, not having been securely replaced since the earth quake of April 18.  The shock yesterday consisted of one short, sharp 'jerk.'  It is said by the scientists that it was one of the to be expected 'settling' shocks caused by the earth's crust in the affected region adjusting its self to the conditions caused by the great quake.
"The building inspecting authorities say that no damage whatever was caused by the shock.

"Voluntary Observer W. H. Martin makes the following report of his observations at the Napa State Hospital for the month of April:
"... Severe earthquake shock April 18th at 5:14 a. m.; slight shocks April 20th, 4:50 a. m.; April 21, 3 a. m.; April 22, 3 p. m.; sharp shocks April 26, 3:15 p. m.; April 29, 12:35 a. m."
It is of interest to compare the dates and times listed above with those of earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) as felt in Napa in the period 18-30 Apr 1906, following the mainshock.  The earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) are as follows:
20 Apr, 04:50;   21 Apr, 03:00;   22 Apr, 15:00; 
25 Apr, 15:15 ("sharp");   28 Apr, 00:35 ("sharp")
The earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) are attributed to W. H. Martin, the observer responsible for the newspaper report above; it is puzzling, then, why there are discrepancies in the dates of the last two quakes, and those dates should be called into question.  For the 25/26 Apr event, based on the time of day and the description in the article, and based on other felt reports in the area on 25 Apr (and not on 26 Apr) it is inferred that this is the 25 Apr event.
Also see the entry for the earthquake reported in Lawson (1908) at 15:15 on 25 Apr 1906 in Napa.  Note that Townley and Allen (1939) list an event in Napa at 15:15 on 25 Apr, but not on 26 Apr.

Many people left their beds and hastened to the streets, expecting momentarily to see their residences collapse.  This heavy shake was followed by two of less violence.  Southern Pacific employees found a locomotive off the rails in the yards this morning, apparently caused by the earthquake through a faulty piece of rail on which it was standing.

Under the heading "Weather Report":
"Voluntary Observer W. H. Martin makes the following report of his observations at the Napa State Hospital for the month of April:
"... Severe earthquake shock April 18th at 5:14 a. m.; slight shocks April 20th, 4:50 a. m.; April 21, 3 a. m.; April 22, 3 p. m.; sharp shocks April 26, 3:15 p. m.; April 29, 12:35 a. m."
It is of interest to compare the dates and times listed above with those of earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) as felt in Napa in the period 18-30 Apr 1906, following the mainshock.  The earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) are as follows:
20 Apr, 04:50;   21 Apr, 03:00;   22 Apr, 15:00; 
25 Apr, 15:15 ("sharp");   28 Apr, 00:35 ("sharp")
The earthquakes listed in Lawson (1908) are attributed to W. H. Martin, the observer responsible for the newspaper report above; it is puzzling, then, why there are discrepancies in the dates of the last two quakes, and those dates should be called into question.  For the 25/26 Apr event, based on the time of day and the description in the article, and based on other felt reports in the area on 25 Apr (and not on 26 Apr) it is inferred that this is the 25 Apr event.  By analogy, and based on a felt report from Santa Rosa on the morning of 28 Apr, it is inferred that the last event is the 28 Apr event.
Townley and Allen (1939) also list an event in Napa at 00:35 on 
28 Apr, but not on 29 Apr.

"A telephone message from Capay says that there has been a land slide at the Wilson ranch at what is known as the shale rocks, that dammed the water completely...."

"Both Mr. Ashley and Mr. Gregory [who were among a party surveying a landslide on Cache Creek, which they located at 'about 4 miles east of the junction of North Fork with Cache Creek'] are of the opinion that the landslide was due to a slight temblor which occurred on Tuesday about 9 a. m."
The time given in this article is inconsistent with the time listed in a letter from Mr. P.N. Ashley which was printed in the Woodland Daily Democrat, 14 May 1906; the time in the latter account is stated as 9 p.m., not 9 a.m.  Because this source is internally inconsistent, and because all other sources indicate that the event occurred at around 21:00 on the night of 1 May, the obvious inference is that the time stated in this article ("9 a. m.") is in error.
Note that a report in The Home Alliance (Woodland), 4 May 1906, p. 9, c. 1, indicates that the landslide occurred prior to and independent of the earthquake.  If that is the case, nothing should be inferred from this report about the intensity at the site of the landslide.

A one-line summary of the keeper's completed chores for the day follows the description of the earthquake above.  Because the description of the earthquake precedes the summary of the day's chores, either the entire entry was recorded late at night (after 22:58), or the earthquake occurred the preceding night, on 30 Apr.  Townley and Allen (1939) list this event at 22:58 on 30 Apr, but the source of their information is not clear.  This issue cannot be resolved with any certainty.

"'At Salinas it is said the shock was much heavier, and that the residents were so frightened they rushed out into the streets.  A number of walls of buildings wrecked in the big earthquake two weeks ago were knocked down.'"
No issues of the Monterey Cypress could be located from 1906.  The date of the original report, and the date of the earthquake, are unknown, although from the time stated it was probably either the 
3 May or 4 May 1906 event.

Workmen in many places were endangered by falling bricks, but no casualties were reported.  The shock was the most severe since that of April 18.
"The shock was distinctly felt in Oakland, and while it did no harm, it frightened some people.
"Professor C. H. Burkhalter, of the Chabot Observatory, said that the shock had been a very slight one as recorded by the seismograph.  'It was only one of many,' he declared, 'that are being caused by the settling of the earth after the shock of April 18....'"

"Another severe earthquake shock occurred ... and was possibly the heaviest since the great one of April 18.  The temblor was felt in all parts of the city and at the University Observatory.  Many people ran from their homes and business houses, fearing a repetition of the one of two weeks ago.
"Professor J. N. LeConte and Dr. Newkirk of the University, recorded the temblor at the observatory, and its intensity was taken on the Rossi-Forel scale which was II.  The shock was instantaneous, so that its duration could not be recorded."
It is not entirely clear which locations are meant by "all parts of the city"; however, it was a common practice of the time to refer to San Francisco simply as "the city."  It is inferred that this description applies, at least in part, to the city of Berkeley.  It probably also applies to San Francisco and perhaps other Bay Area locations.

"It reacht Lakeport at 8:15, coming from the west, and went on over to Bartlett Springs, where its trail was lost.  It did not pick buildings up and let them down again, as its big brother did on the 18th of April, nor did it cause the earth to roll in billows.  It simply took hold of the buildings and rattled them-gave them a lively mischievous shaking, as if it wanted to frighten the people.
"And it frightened them, too, for their nerves were still on edge from the 18th.  They flockt into the streets in short order and most of them made a bee line for Main street to see if the brick buildings were still standing.  They were, and no damage was done in the town...."

"The almost common salutation in Eureka this morning was: 'Did you feel the shake last night?' to which the response would be 'Did you feel it this morning?'  Last night and this morning Eureka experienced two rather heavy 'jars,' that of last night, however, being much the heavier.  It occurred between 9:25 and 9:30, lasting several seconds, during which time it rattled things about considerably.  However, it was not severe enough to be felt by those standing on terra firma, and the only thing which made it apparent to those already on the street that there was something doing in the seismic line was the sight of people rushing out of doors, particularly from the Second street saloons.  As far as can be learned the only effect of last night's temblor was to rattle things a little, principally dishes, glassware and sash weights, and some people, many of whom appeared decidedly rattled as they ran out from buildings.
"Although there was no panic, a large part of the audience at the Girton theater hurriedly left the place with the first tremor.  It was a remarkable coincidence, and one that undoubtedly added to the fear of the audience, that their nerves were keyed up by the stereopticon views of earthquake scenes at San Francisco, which were just then being projected on the screen at the theater.  A telephone message to San Francisco soon after the shake brought the reply that the shock had not been felt there, and inquiry of other places this morning and about the city brought no tales of damage of any kind...."

Because the earthquake occurred "today" and not "tonight," and because the article probably would have been written before bedtime on the 13th, we assume the writer means 11 am, not 11 pm.

"Two heavy jolts of earthquake at 3.55 Wednesday afternoon, brought down a shower of bricks from the upper story of the Court House.  Dick Nolte, McConnell's crack abstractor, never touched the ground in his flight to the street.  Mike Donovan went into the Assessor's vault and closed the door.  Deputy Clerk Shaw and Treasurer Welch ran a tie foot race to the iron fence.  Sheriff Croxon and Under-Sheriff Kearney shot out of the old jail like rockets.  Mrs. John Garner, who was acting as School Superintendent during John's absence, stood the shock well, but concluded to call it a day and went home."
There is evidence to suggest a larger earthquake occurred in the same area one day later, around 20:20 on 17 May 1906.  This event, on 16 May, may have been a preshock to the 17 May event.  Note that the 17 May event was not reported by this newspaper.  This may be because the newspaper was published weekly on Fridays, and it may have gone to press by the time the larger earthquake occurred on Thursday night, 17 May.
This does not appear to be a misdated (and mistimed) report of the 17 May event, as all the people mentioned in the article were at their place of business, which, most likely, would not have been the case had the event occurred at night, after 20:00.

It is not clear whether the date of this event was 17 or 24 May; however, based on the timing of the event and on other felt reports in the area on 17 May (and not on 24 May) it is presumed that this is the 17 May event.

Durham (1998) identifies two locations named Mile Rocks, one in Sonoma County and the other in San Francisco County.  Looking at the maps in the atlas portion of Lawson (1908), the San Francisco County "Mile Rocks" location is on Maps 4, 17, and 19, whereas the Sonoma County location of that name is not on any of the maps.  The inference is made that "Mile Rocks" in the list of aftershocks in Lawson (1908) refers to the San Francisco County location.

Although thick in the business of ordinances and resolutions each separate city father dropped his work.  Several men in the lobby rose and left the room.

"In Oakland persons ran from the buildings into the streets, and while very perceptible in all parts of the city no damage was done.

The 20:40 event time matches the time given in all the other reports in the "box" (which all describe the 17 May event).  Most likely, this "box" was first published in the daily version of this paper, on 
18 May 1906, then reprinted verbatim in the San Luis Obispo Tribune, a semi-weekly paper.  When it was reprinted, "last evening" was not corrected as it should have been to reflect the passage of several days' time.  The daily version of this paper could not be located.

"Last night at about 8:45 windows began rattling, slightly at first, but presently in an ominously violent manner, causing people to look at each other in an inquiring sort of manner that seemed to say: 'Isn't about time to hike outside?'
"The trembling lasted about 18 seconds, then came a succession of thumps that only lasted a few seconds, but rocked some of the people out of their houses pretty lively.  It was nearly as severe as No. 1 of the Big Series that came on the 18th of last month, but unlike that one, it was not followed up.  No damage whatsoever was done here."

San Francisco Examiner,
18 May 1906;  p. 3, c. 4
"SAN JOSE, May 17.-Frightened by prophesies of the world's end, hundreds of women became panic stricken to-night when what seemed the heaviest shock since April 18th rocked the town.  Despite the apparent force of the temblor, however, not even the shakiest walls were injured or disturbed.
"At the Jose Theatre a crowded house rose as the lights upon the stage went out, and rushed towards the doors.  The coolness of the employees and several other men stopped the panic before any one had been injured.  Although many left the theatre, the performance was continued.  For days San Jose has been deeply agitated over the mysterious appearance upon the fences and dead walls of the city of placards and signs predicting the speedy end of the earth....
"When the shock came to-night the scenes throughout the residence section of the city were those of a wildly disturbed community.  Women rushed from every house screaming and terrorstricken.  Crying to one another that the end of the world had come, they dashed from their homes without a thought of consequences.  The efforts to calm them by the men that remained collected were futile-their fear was not one that could be reasoned with.  Blind, unreasoning terror, superstitious fright, was all powerful.  There was scarcely a street upon which were not huddled frightened groups of women seeking refuge from the houses that rocked with the force of the quake.  To persuade the nervous to return to the houses was a difficult task, and in a few instances impromptu tents formed the night's shelter."

"While the members of the City Council were deep in the consideration of municipal business during the meeting of the Council committees last night ... an earthquake rocked the City Hall, and in an instant the business of the meeting was forgotten.  Councilmen and lobby ___* seized their hats, and made ready to fly to the safety of the open air, should the shock become more violent.
"Several gentlemen ... took no chances but left the Council chamber with more haste than dignity and sought safety in the ___* until assured that the ___* was over.  When satisfied that there was no danger of the immediate destruction of the City Hall by the convulsions of Mother Earth, those who had fled returned, the City Fathers resumed the business which had been interrupted and the earthquake was forgotten."

"A slight earthquake was felt in Templeton at or near the hour of 11 o'clock Wednesday night of this week.  Wouldn't that jar you?"
This paper was published weekly on Wednesdays.  "Wednesday night of this week" could not refer to 6 Jun, because the paper must have been published by that time.  Alternatively, it seems unusual to refer to 30 May (one full week before publication) as "Wednesday ... of this week."  The time of the event leads one to speculate that it may be describing the event of 4 Jun 1906, in which case "Wednesday" would have been erroneously substituted for "Monday."  At best, the date is speculative.

"The people were greatly alarmed and rushed from their home into the streets.  Many did not venture indoors for several hours.  It was feared that another shake was imminent.  The entire section felt the shake.  It lasted for several seconds.  No damage has been reported."
Presumably, this is the 31 May event as reported in the Humboldt Standard and Humboldt Times, but the date is incorrect here.

As in the case of most of the after shocks recorded since April 18, the main direction of the temblor was from southeast to northwest.
"The shock was very perceptible in all parts of this city, and many of the residents who had retired were awakened by a dull, rumbling sound, followed by a sudden shaking of buildings.  Others who were up at the hour of the seismic disturbance noticed the shock.  No damage resulted from the temblor.

"The shock was almost from west to east ... and was of somewhat a different character from the big shake which created havoc with the state.  The greatest intensity was a few seconds after it was first felt, and then it gradually died away.
"Although sharp, the quake was not at all violent, and did no damage.  Quite a number of people were frightened.  At the Court House the county officials hesitated in their work, and paid little visits to each other in their respective offices, and the District Attorney descended the stairs about four steps at a time....
"The earthquake was general along the coast as far as heard from, having about the same range as the big one.  It was felt at Oakland and intervening points.  From the fact that the temblor came from the west and was felt all along the coast with practically the same intensity, it is considered that it was caused by some disturbance in midocean."

"A little piece of belated news has floated down from the old town of Shasta that is important inasmuch as it shows that on last Friday afternoon there was some sort of a disturbance in the Shasta region, probably an earthquake, that caused much commotion and some damage.
"About 1 o'clock that afternoon, which in the quiet old town is the quietest time of the day, when everything is still and not a soul is to be seen except those who sit on their east porches to cool themselves off, a terrific rumbling and crashing noise was heard, coming apparently from the northern part of town.
"Those who heard it, and nearly everyone in Shasta experienced the sensation, thought it was an earthquake and the street was very soon filled with an anxious and inquiring populace.  The crashing noise emanated from the old Charles McDonald saloon and there was a general rush for that building....
"[Inside] on the floor lay tons of debris-bricks, laths and plastering.  The ceiling had fallen in with the exception of one solitary joist and a portion of the interior walls collapsed.
"A peculiar feature about the affair is that a large and valuable glass mirror that hung behind the bar escaped uninjured and unscarred.
"About the same time that the McDonald saloon interior collapsed an incident occurred on the Iron Mountain road that gives strength to the earthquake theory.  A driver was watering his team at the trough between Shasta and Iron Mountain.  He asserts positively that about 1 o'clock, as he stood at the trough watering his horses, he heard a terrible rumbling and rolling noise and on looking up saw huge rocks and boulders rolling down the hillside.  He even saw the places from whence these boulders came, and was confident nothing less than an earthquake could have loosened them.
"There are many old buildings in Shasta that would not need much of a shock to reduce them to a pile of debris and many believe that Friday's affair was simply the natural cause of decay, but the Iron Mountain incident, occurring at the same time, is either evidence of a seismic disturbance or a very remarkable coincidence."
An article on p. 2, c. 1 of the 13 Jul 1906 issue of the Courier-Free Press adds more information to this story:
"... The building had not been used for years, but Will Hartman was preparing to use the building for sleeping quarters, as it was one of the coolest places in town.  He noticed the walls spreading and concluded not to occupy the place.  Soon after the roof and timbers crashed in."

"A report came over the railroad wire Saturday saying that there was an earthquake shock in Coalinga at about 10 o'clock Friday night.  The report stated that the Odd Fellows were holding a meeting, and the severity of the jar caused the company to hurry onto the streets.  No damage is reported from the temblor, but the people were badly frightened.
"Railroad men coming from Lemoore Saturday morning, said that the shock was felt there at about the same time that Coalinga was shaken, but the jar was not so perceptible.  The disturbance was felt here by a few, and was apparently very slight, but Hanford will not be envious of the two towns to the west on account of their being favored by a greater shock."

"It was rumored around town today that a severe earthquake was felt last night at Coalinga, Volta, and Los Banos.  At the two former places the shock was quite severe and many people rushed out of their houses.  The shock occurred about 11 p. m."
It seems unlikely that Volta would have a sufficiently higher intensity than Los Banos, given the proximity of the two locations, the similar underlying geology, and the fact that the epicenter is almost certainly closer to Los Banos than to Volta.
The nature of this report, and the lack of a report from Visalia in this or in other Visalia newspapers, suggest that this earthquake was not felt in Visalia.

"It is so long since the report of an earthquake in the State that it kind of surprises one to learn that what the geographers call terra firma, give a little shrug at about 1 o'clock Friday morning."
It is not clear whether the date of this event was 20 or 27 Jul.  It should be noted, however, that this paper was the weekly version of the Daily Gazette (Martinez), and articles printed in the daily version in a given week were often re-printed at the end of the week in the weekly version, without any information as to the date on which the article was originally published.  (In other words, it is possible that this article was originally printed as early as 21 Jul, in which case "Friday" would refer to 20 Jul.)  Based on the timing of the event and on other felt reports in the area on 20 Jul (and not on 27 Jul) it is presumed that this is the 20 Jul event.  No copies of the Daily Gazette could be located for Jul 1906.

"A chasm about four feet wide and seemingly bottomless lies open for over a mile through the snow.
"Whether the crack was caused by a readjustment of the earth's crust in the vicinity, or by an explosion of gases, cannot yet be determined.  Some investigation has been made by people in the vicinity and they have found a black mineralized substance resembling asphalt in some of its properties....

"The fissure makes a dark line where it opened up through the snow on the mountain side.
"It would seem that the rending of the ground was accompanied by an earthquake, as the chimney of a house belonging to Mr. Hess, and standing about one hundred and fifty yards from the fissure, was thrown down by the shock.  The earthquake shock did not extend very far however or at least it was not felt.

It was not a very serious affair, but as it was slow in action nervous people feared that it might be preliminary to a more serious disturbance.  Light sleepers in frail buildings were awakened, but it was such a minor shake that they turned over and went to sleep again....  No damage whatever is reported.
"The seismograph at the students' observatory caught the records distinctly and the belief is that the center of the vibrations was about fifty miles away.  Here is the official reading of the seismograph:
"'The earthquake of this morning started at 12:26:37 P. S. T.  The preliminary tremor lasted for six seconds when the main shock began.  This was in two parts, the first and more severe lasting for twenty-one seconds, the other lasting for twenty-eight seconds, giving a total duration of 49 seconds for the main shock.  The Omori Seismograph from which these data have been taken showed smaller tremors for nearly three minutes.  The direction of the vibrations was from southwest to northeast.  A greater disturbance is shown in the east and west component than in the north and south.  The center of the shock is about fifty miles distant.  The maximum amplitude of the shock is one-one-hundredth of an inch.'"

"... a quite determined jolt occasioned by some internal disturbance of Mother Earth.  The shock lasted five or six seconds, perhaps, and caused many a person to 'sit up and take notice.'  Some even got out of bed and out into the cold, cold world evidently from fear that something might drop.  But nothing did drop or fall down, and so far as has been learned no damage was done.  The shock was also felt in San Jose, San Francisco and all of the peninsula towns."

"Mr. Perrine of 2138 Alameda avenue, father of Professor Charles Perrine, the well known astronomer, possesses the only seismograph in Alameda....  The record shows three-quarters of an inch, almost directly east and west, with a slight variation to the southeast and northwest.

"Reports reached here early this morning by way of the railroad telegraph lines of an earthquake shock in San Francisco, occurring some time after midnight.  The Southern Pacific operator in the Flood building said that the shock seemed as heavy as the one that caused the disaster of last spring.  The furniture in the office danced about the room.  So far as the railroad operator knew the damage in the city was not great.  The wires were working well.
"By telephone to Oakland it was learned that a very severe earthquake was felt at 12:45 in San Francisco, Oakland and other cities as far south as Stockton.  No shock was felt at Fresno or in this city.
"The telephone operator at Oakland said that no reports of serious damage had been received up to 2 o'clock.
"A later report by telephone from the telephone operator at Oakland said that the shock occurred at 12:38 and lasted 11 seconds.  The shock caused great terror, but so far it appeared that little damage had been done."
In comparison to other reports from San Francisco, this account seems greatly exaggerated.

"Weather overcast all day.  Quite a heavy earthquake shock occurred during the night.  Examiner said it was 'No. 4.'  E.L.D. returned on morning train and met H.L.T. at 4:20 San Jose in the Large Loco [sic]."
According to T. Toppozada (CDMG; written comm., 2001), two sets of diaries for each year exist-one for the ranch and one for the office.  Tevis did not write the diaries, his valet did.  No mention is given of the valet's name.  Tevis lived in Alma, outside of Los Gatos on the road to Santa Cruz.  He was an early California millionaire and had a ranch near Los Gatos and a house in San Francisco.
The location where the aforementioned earthquake was felt is not stated but is inferred from the rest of the diary entry.

"No harm resulted from the earthquake, the vibrations only being of a few seconds duration."
*  Compare this article with similar articles that appeared in the Courier-Free Press and the Searchlight, both of Redding.  
The latter two articles were presumably copied from the Daily People's Cause (the daily version of this paper, which could not be located for 1907).  In the two Redding papers, the word "not" appears at the place marked by an asterisk above; in this article, however, the word "not" does not appear at that location.  Based on the inconsistency, and from the context, it appears that this was an accidental typographical omission.  It is inferred that the line was intended to read "... excitement early Sunday morning that all did not share."

"Quite a lively earthquake shock was felt in Salinas at 4:42 o'clock yesterday afternoon, causing people to run into the street for fear that a harder one might follow.  In the court house, during the Naredo trial, consternation reigned for a moment and several persons made for the door, but Judge Sargent rapped for order and spoke a few words of reassurance, and allayed their fears.  After a few moments the trial proceeded.  Sunday night two very slight shocks were felt here, the first about 11:50 and the other about five minutes later.-Salinas Journal."

"At 1:25 o'clock this afternoon a sharp earthquake shock was felt in this city.  The duration was only about two seconds, and the vibration seemed more like that caused by some explosion of dynamite than like a temblor.  Many people evidently had the same idea about it, for inquiries came pouring into the Mail office by telephone from persons who wanted to know whether it was really a genuine, simon-pure earthquake or not.
"The shock was more pronounced in buildings, especially tall structures, than on the streets.  At the High school the full force was felt, but the pupils were not uneasy.
"Immediately after the temblor a message was sent to San Francisco by the Mail to ascertain whether any damage had been done there.  Word came back that no quake had been felt in the metropolis."
Note that, with respect to San Francisco, this report contradicts information given in the Antioch Ledger of 2 Nov 1907 (p. 4, c. 1), and in the Stockton Daily Evening Record of 29 Oct 1907 (p. 5, c. 1), which state that the earthquake was felt lightly in San Francisco.

"Did you feel it?
"Yes, it was an earthquake, a real temblor, but a little one.  It happened at exactly 1:25 o'clock this afternoon.  The motion, whether from east to west or north to south, the reporter could not determine, but he was assured that it was disagreeable and a bit alarming....
"The shock was quite severe for Stockton, but not heavy enough to do any damage, not even to buildings in course of construction.  At the time it happened a Record reporter was taking a telephone message from the County Hospital.  The speaker ceased talking for a few moments and then cut in with, 'Say, did you feel that?  My, but it was heavy here.  A patient was shaken right out of his chair.  No, it did no damage....'
"A message from the Holden drug store stated that the shock was believed there to have been as severe as the big quake on April 18th of last year.
"The Southern Pacific depot in this city also reported that the shock was quite violent, nearly as heavy as the big one of nineteen months ago....
"Immediately after the shock people began telephoning from all over town to the Record, asking if damage had been done in San Francisco.  The Record operator at once ticked off the query over the Record's leased wire to San Francisco, asking if the quake had done damage there.  The answer flashed back that the quake had been very light there and had done no damage....
"'Long Distance,' in the telephone office, stated that the shock was felt quite heavily in Oakland, but not in San Francisco.  She said no damage had been reported from anywhere...
"It is probable that the quake was a San Joaquin special.  It was apparently more severe in this county than anywhere else, but if they never come harder than that no harm will be done....
"Out in Fair Oaks the shock was particularly heavy.  In the big school house there the pupils and teachers were badly frightened.  The teachers lined up the pupils and marched them out into the yard.  One of the teachers became hysterical and the result was that the school was dismissed for the day.  The shock knocked books off the shelves in the school library."

Many people who happened to be on the second and third floors at the time report having had quite a shock.

General Comments:


1.  For some of the entries in this catalog, the date and time were omitted from the actual citation, in an effort to save space.  In all cases where the date and time, or any text, is omitted from the citation, it is replaced by editorial ellipses.  The date and time are always given (when known) under the appropriate columns in the table.


2.  Obvious typographical errors in newspaper sources were corrected without comment.


3.  A common statement in many of the articles reads something like: "two shocks of earthquake were felt in the morning" or "several shocks of earthquake were felt last night."  The authors of this paper have not been able to determine consistently whether statements such as these meant that two (or several) separate earthquakes were felt, or whether one earthquake was felt which had two (or several) distinct "jolts."  Indeed, in many cases it appears that it meant that only one earthquake was felt, but in other cases, the context of the article implies that it meant that multiple earthquakes were felt.  This ambiguity and apparently inconsistent use of the phrase may have resulted from a poor understanding of the earthquake process, i.e., some people at the time may have thought that earthquakes which occurred minutes apart were all part of the same event.


4.  Reports far from the source location were not included if they appeared to be based entirely on a report that was published near (or nearer) the source location.  For example, a report that appeared in a Humboldt Co. newspaper of a SFBA earthquake would not be included (or referenced) in this catalog if a nearly identical report appeared in a SFBA newspaper; in that case, the SFBA newspaper report would be included instead.


5.  This catalog is intended to be used in conjunction with, but not to replace, Townley and Allen (1939) or Lawson (1908).  Most aftershock reports listed in Townley and Allen (1939) and Lawson (1908) were not included in this catalog; they were listed here only for a few selected earthquakes and only when those reports contained information not found in the newspapers, diaries, and other historic documents.


Ý  The column "Unreliable? Not Felt?" only contains an entry if the report is considered unreliable, or if the earthquake was stated or inferred to have been not felt in the location in question; otherwise, this column is left blank.
