AEROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS
[Aerological Division, D. hl. LITTLE In charge]
By B. FRANCIS DASHIELL
During October 1938 a total of 523 aerological observa-
tions were macle by airplane and radiosonde a t 18 points in the tTnited States. The mean free-nir data based on these observations are gken in tables 1 and la. They include
the basic meteorological elements of pressure, .temperature, and relative humidity, recorded a t certain geometric
heights. At four stations a niasinium height of 31 kilon!e- ters was reached during 3 1 racliosonde observations, wliile all of the 309 observations listed in table la reached a
height, of 16 kilometers.
The “means” are omitted whenever less than 15 observa- tions nre made a t the surface and less than 5 a t a standard
height, but 15 observations are required for those levels
that come within the upper and lower limits of the
nionthly vertical range of the tropopause. A brief descrip- tion of the met,hods used for computing these means will
be found under “Aerological Observations” in the January 1935 issue of the MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW.
The month of October was abnormally warm, as shown
by chart 1. The mean swjace temperatures (O F .) were
above nornial throughont the entire United States, with only minor exceptions along the south Atlantic coast, and
in Florida and portions of California. East of the Missis- sippi River and west of the Rocky Mountains, the depar-
tures of mean surface temperature above the normal
were moderate, but in the central States and upper
Missouri valley the mean temperatures were in excess by as much as loo F. above the normal. These positive
MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW 33 1
departur?s ,in October showed a continuance of the ten-
dency existing throughout the summer and fall months of
1938 for the surface temperature to range considerably
above the noraal. Mean free-air temperatures (" C.) recorded abow tlie surface over the United States cluring October a t all sta-
tions were seasonally lower than those noted in the preced-
ing month of September, except over Sault Ste. Marie,
Mich., a t 3 kilometers. The highest mean temperatures
were confined generally to the southern half of the country, but a warm area pushed northward as far as Omaha,
Nebr. The highest October nieans for the countiy, as
recorded a t each level, were noted over Pensacoh, Fla.
(18.2' C.); Oklahoma City, Okla. (18.3' C.); El Paso, Tes. (18.3' C., 15.4' C., 11.9' C., and 8.1' C.); and over Pensa-
cola, Fl?. (0.2' C. and -5.S°C.)*at 0.5, 1, 1.6, 2, 2.6, 3 ,4 , and 5 kilometers, respectively. +he lowest mean temper-
tures of 6.8' C., 6.0' C., 6.2' C., 2.9' C., 1.9' C., -6.0' C., and -12.4' C., occurred o ~e r Saiilt Ste. Marie, Mich.,
a t 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,4, and 6 kilometers, respectively, while
the lowest a t 3 kilometers (-0.1' C.) was reported over Seattle, Wash. Mean temperatures were decidedly lower during the
current month a t all levels over Seattle arid Spokane,
Wash., than those recorded in September when the same two stations reported exceptionally warm means a t all
levels. Over Spokane, Wash., the mean temperatures in October were lower than in September by 10.0' C., 9.5' C.,
8.5' c., 7.2' c., 6.0' c ., 4.3' e., and 3.4' c., at 1, 1.5, 2*
2.5, 3, 4, and 5 kilometers, respectively. However, vver
Sault Ste. Marie, htich., Chicago, Ill., Nashville, Tenn., and Omaha, Nebr., the mean temperatures for October a t
each level were only slightly lower than those recorded in the preceding month of September.
In the high altitudes above 5 kilometers, where records
were obtained only by radiosonde, the lowest mean temper- ature for the United States was -65.2' C., over Oklahonia
City, Okla., a t 17 kilometers. Slightly higher mean mini-
mum temperatures (-60.6' C . and -6214' C.) were re-
corded farther north over Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Fargo, N. Dak. All of the lowest mean temperatures for all stations were recorded along the 17-kilometer level as
was also the case during the preceding month of Septem-
ber. A gradual increase in the mean temperature occurred
upward above 17 kilometers, to as much as -60.4' C'. over
Oklahoma City, Okla., a t 21 Iiilometers. This was the lowest recorded a t the highest altitude reached in October. However, temperatures for the current month were sliglitIy
higher in the high altitudes than those recorded during September a t correspoiiding levels.
Isobaric charts prepared from the mean pressure data
given in tables 1 and l a , showed that during Octnher a statistical low pressure area esisted in the lower levels
over Fargo, N. Dak. In the higher levels this area es-
tended east and west over the entire northern tier of
States, but was centered over Sault Ste. hlarie, Rlich. Pressure, however, in the higher altitudes reached by
radiosondes, continued lower over Fargo, N. Dak., as
well as Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. Pressure was relatively low over the far Northwest, but it was high over the southern States a t all levels with the center apparently
over Pensacoh, Fla. Mean pressures recorded over the country in October showed little difference from those
noted during September, but they were slightly lower over
the South in the upper levels, and decidedly lower over Fargo, N. Dak., a t all levels. High relative humidities prevailed during October over
most of the Far West, the Pacific coast, and the Northeast,
articularly over Spokane, Wash., and Sault Ste. Marie, &ich., a t all levels. This distribution coincided closely wit11 those sections of the United States that showed high
percentages of normal precipitation for October, but differed from that condition which esisted in the previous
month of September when high huniitlities were found
over the eastern linlf of the country. The highest mean humidity for the United States was recorded over Sault
Ste. Marie, htich., a t all levels. I t clirniiiished steadily
from 90 percent a t the surhce to 56 percent a t 5 kilo-
meters, and 47 percent a t 9 liilometers. El Paso, Tex., reported the lowest humidity recorded in the lower levels
(39 percent), but this wizs increased to 60 percent, a t 4
kilometers. Over Norfolk, Va., the lowest humidity re-
ported at all levels above 2 kilometers (32 lercent nt, 4 kilometers) was noted. This situation he I d generally
over most of the rest of the South and Southeast. But a t Omaha, Nebr., while mean relative humidities were COR+
parntively high at a11 levels, that State reported the small- est amount of precipitation of any during October (11
percent of normal). Resultant winds in the free atmosphere, based on pilot-
balloon observations made new 5 a. m. (75th meridian
tinie), are shown in table 2. The resultant wind directions remained much closer to their normals during the month
of October than in the preceding month of September when
unusually wide divergences were noted. However, there were several outstanding departures in resultant velocities from normal observed in October, but these were mostly
less than normal and confined generally to the 3- and 4-
kilometer levels.
The outstanding departures or differences between the October resultant directions and their normals in each
level over the United States were: 163' a t hIedford, Oreg. (when the October direction is rotated in a clockwise
direction away from its normal); 119', 87', 82', 96', and 86' (when rota ted counterclockwise) over Oakland, Calif. ;
162' (counterc,locIiwise) and 153' (clockwise) over Key
West, Fla. ; and 75' (counterclockwise) over Spokane,
Wash.; a t the surface, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 kilo- meters, respectively.
The greatest departures of the resultant directions from normal a t all levels were noted over Oaliland, Calif.; Key
West, Fla.; Rfedford, Oreg.; Atlanta, Ga.; San Diego, Calif.; and Nashville, Tenn. Over Oakland, Calif., the
October resultant directions were 155', 235', 27S0, 270°,
244', 246'. 251', 305', and 332', as compared to the
estnblished normfils of 156O, 354', 5', 352', 340', 332', 294', 2 7 2 O , and 313', a t the surface, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
2.5, 3, 4, and 5 kilometers, respectively. As previously
recorded for several months in 1938, the stations a t St. Louis, Mo. ; Chicago, Ill. ; and Oklahoma City, Okla.,
again showed the least departures from the October
resultant directions and their normitls a t all levels. Farther north, a t hledford, Oreg., the greatest departures occurred a t the surface and a t 0.5 kilometer, where the
differences were 163' and 113', when rotated in a clock- wise direction. Above these levels the differences were
much less, and the monthly resultants departed in an opposite direction with a counterclocliwise rotation away from normal. In the South, over Atlanta, Ga.; Nashville,
Tenn. ; and Pensacola, Fla., decided variations from normal were noted in the upper levels. Above 1.5 kilometers
they depnrted widely froin normal in a clockwise direction so that the winds were northerly. Atlanta, Ga.; showed outstanding departures a t all levels. These difl'ercnces
were: lo', 25O, 26O, 62', 45', 53', 67', 64', and 68',
departing in a clockwise direction northward from normal,

a t the surface, and 0.5, 1, 1.5,3, 2.5,3,4, and 5 kilometers, respectively. The distribution of resultant wind direc6ions over the United States a t all levels during October showed that,
above the surface, the winds were almost gerierally from a
westerly direction. -4t 1.5 kilometers 45 percent of t81ie winds fell in the northwest qusdra.nt, 32 perce,nt in tlie
southwest, 14 percent in the southeast,, and 9 percent in
tlie east,. Of all the winds having west,erly components those from the northwest qua.drant precloiiiiiiatecl slightly
a t all levels up to 4 kilometers. At 5 kilometers, however,
50 percent of the winds were southwesterly, 37 percent.
northwesterly, and 13 percent northeasterly. A small
percentage of the directions fell in t,he northeast quadrant at all of the levels from 0.5 t.o 5 kilometers.
Over Snn Diego, Calif., Seatt,le, Wash., Albuclnerque, N. Mes., a.nd Cheyenne, Wyo., the current ~&d tlirect,ions
departed from normal by turning in n counte,rclocl~~~~lse rotation et all levels, while over Atlanta, Ga. (as esplnined),
Boston, Mass., and Brooklyn, N. P., tlie winds departed
from normal by rotating in clockwise directions. The departures in direckion a t each level over a,ll pilot-halloon
stations were nearly equally divided-56 percent hnriiig
comit~erc.lock~~-iue rohtions away from their normals, and
the average shat.ion departure from nornia.1 for each level
showed there was a st,eadp increase in the departure riif- ferences with dtiturle. These average differences (a.!l
stations) betwcen t,he ciirrent resultant direct,ions and the
norm& for each level were: 2O0, 3S0, 34O, 25O, 29O, 3 2 O ,
35O, 44O, and 4 7 O , a.t tlie surface, and a.t 0.5, 1, 1 .5 , 2 ,
2.5, 3, 4, aid 5 kilometers, respeclively. The 2-kiloinefer level showed the RiOSt consistent depmture in direction,
for 63 percent of all stations recorded departures thn.t rotated count8ercloctkwise from their nornials.
Resultant wind velocities during October were less than
normil a t Bostjon, hiass., by negative differences of 0.8,
2.3, 3.8, 3.2, 4.0, 3.7, 2.7, and 5.6 meters per s,econd, at the surface, a,nd a t 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,4, and 5 kilometers, reupective,ly. Tius sta.t,ion showed more negative depar-
tures a.t ail consecutive levels t1ia.n tiny other st.ation In t,lie c,ountry. Billings, Mont., Cliica,go, Ill., Detroit,
Micll., Spokane, M-n.sh., and St. Louis, Mo., reported snxdlcr negut.ive departures a t a11 levels. No station
showed posit,ive (or grmter thnn normul) velocity de-
prtures a t d l levels, but a t Pensxoln, Fla., Srtlt Lake City, Utah, and Snn Diego, Calif., large positive departure differemes were recorded n t most of the levels. In this
respect, I'eiis~ola, Fla., indicn.t,ed the greatest positive diflerences for the country of 1.1, 3.0, 3.4, 2.7, 0.8, and 1.4
meters per second, a t 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 kilometers, respectirely. Light velocit,ies, 1x8 well as slight departures
froin the resulta,nit veloc.it'y normals, occurred a t Oakland, Calif., Fitrgo, N . Dnk., Nashville, Te.nn., Key West, Fla.,
and At,lantn, Ga.. Several of these stations showed, as a re- sult, ou tstanding resultzmt direction departures from normal.
htasirnuni wind vdocities for October, as shown in
tn.ble 3, occurred a t a nuniber of stations ove,r the Umted
St.nt.es. Winds having a speed of 50 meters per second or
inore (1 14 miles per hour or more) were reported from. Las

RIVERS AND FLOODS
[River and Flood Dirlsior:. MURRILL B~RNIRD in charge]
By BENNETT SWENSON
No floods occurred during the month of October 1938 with the exception of floods in the upper Mississippi
Basin and in the lower Rio Grande which were a continu-
ation of oveiflows that begn.n in September. The flood
in the upper Mississippi will be discussed below. Tllo overflow in t,lie Rio Grande WAS limited to the extreme lower reach of the river. Flood stage was esceeded at8
Mercedes and Brownsville, Tes., from September 29 to
October 3 and crested on October 1 a t a stage of 22.0
feet a t the former station and 18.6 feet a t t'he latter. The principal damage in this flood was caused by a bren.k in the main levee, on the American side of t,he river,
about 2 or 3 miles above Brownsville, Tes., resulting in
inundat,ion of approximately 1,200 ncres of land. The total damage hn.s bee,n estimated a t $2,500. The upper hlississippi flood resulted from heavy rains
over southern Minnesota, sou thern Wisconsin, northern
Illinois, and centrnl and nort,liern Iowa. The flood was largely a tribut,ary flood, with the Chippewa, Black,
Wisconsin, Zumbro, and llliitewater Rivers particulurly , experiencing unusually severe floods. The heavy rains began about September 5 and cont,inued until September 14, and occurred again from the 17th to the 19th, but the
rains of the latter pei-iod were not generally as intense and did not have a great effect on t'he high water escept
to prolong it somewhat. Figure 1 shows the distribution
of precipitation from September 5 to 14. The dn.ta used in the preparation of the isohyets may be found in CZiinat obog<ca I Da.ta . A meteorologid analysis of the storm shows that t8he rainfn.11 was caused primarily by a strong influx of moist
tropical air from the south and southwest overrunning a. wedge of cold polar air to the north a.nd northeast, over
the extreme upper portion of the hlississippi Valley. This condition persisted almost ent.irely from September
5 to 14. The front a t the surface 1n.y in a general enst-west direction approsimat'ely over the southern boundaries of
hlinneso tn. and Wisconsin and remained almost stationary
from the .?itch to the 12th. A series of active waves moving
along this front produced frequent rains during this
.
period. On the 12th a mass of polar air moved in from
the northewst and the front was displaced slightly to the
southeast, resulting in clearing weather temporarily. However, on the morning of the 13th another wave had advnnced northeastward to southwestern Iowa accom- panied by modern tely heavy precipitation. This disturb-
nnce niored slowly eastward from that point followed by a:
large mass of dry polar air which dominated the upper
Mississippi region by the evening of September 14.
The stream of tropical air which invaded the upper
hlississippi Valley from September 5 to 14 was maintained by a large anticyclone situated over extrem? eastern
United States and extending to high elevations. At 14,000 feet the center was located approximately over
western Tenneseee and doniinated most of the eastern half of the country. The persistence of this anticyclone
prevented any marked invasion of polar air except in the extreme upper portion of the Mississippi Basin until the 14tJ1, when the anticyclone weakened considerably a t
high levels and was displaced to the southward and southeastward. At the snme time a low a t high levels
moved eastward over the Lake region and brought in cold
air from the northwest over most of the Mississippi Valley.
The flood was unusual in that floods rarely occur a t
thnt senson of the year in the upper Mississippi Basin, the flood season estefiding usually from March to June.
Table 1 presents crest stages a t various points on the principal streams t\gether with comparative data.
The following reports have been submitted by the officials in charge :k t the various river district offices in
the upper Mississippi Valley:
LA CHOSSE, WIS., RIVER DIbTRICT
Il'hiieu~trr and Zimbro Rivtrs in ~~ffnnesota.-An intense local
flood of sl1o.t durntion occurred in the Whitewater River area from September 6th to 9th. Two stornis of over 2 inches of rain pro-
duced dirartrous floods in this valley which caused considerable loss to bridges, highways, crops, and a few buildings. Flood damage rn as greatest at Weaver, Minn., alRo considerable damage occurred at Elba and Braver, Minn.; the latter town was isolated and had the highest stage recorded in years.
