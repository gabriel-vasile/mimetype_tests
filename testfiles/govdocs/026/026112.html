style='font-size:14.0pt'>EOIR Announces Latest Disciplinary Actions Under Rules 
    of Professional Conduct</span></b><br>
<b><i>Three Attorneys Immediately 
    Suspended; Three Receive Final Orders</i></b></p>
  <p>FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Executive Office for 
    Immigration Review (EOIR) has taken disciplinary action against six attorneys 
    after charging them with violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct for 
    immigration practitioners.  The rules appear in Title 8 of the Code of Federal 
    Regulations (8 CFR Parts 1003 and 1292).  In most cases, the disciplinary 
    action is initiated as a result of sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions 
    or a criminal conviction.</p>
  <p>Although the disciplinary process may vary according 
    to the specific circumstances of each case, generally it includes the following 
    steps:</p>
  <p>Disciplinary proceedings begin with a Notice 
    of Intent to Discipline filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) 
    by the Office of the General Counsel of either EOIR or the Department of Homeland 
    Security (DHS).  The BIA requires the attorney to respond to the alleged violations.  
    In some cases, a Petition for Immediate Suspension also is filed and the BIA 
    orders the attorney to be suspended immediately from practice before the immigration 
    courts, the BIA, and the DHS.  (DHS joins EOIR in taking the disciplinary 
    action.)  Disciplined attorneys are directed to notify promptly, in writing, 
    any clients with cases currently pending before the BIA, the immigration courts, 
    or the DHS that they may no longer represent clients before these tribunals. 
     Disciplined attorneys must petition and be reinstated by the BIA before they 
    can resume the practice of law before the BIA, the immigration courts, and 
    the DHS.</p>
    <p><b>Immediate Suspension</b><br>
The BIA ordered the immediate suspension of 
    the following attorneys:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Maritza Regalado:</b> She was disbarred from the practice of law by 
      the Supreme Court of Florida for neglect and engaging in acts involving 
      dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.  She was immediately suspended 
      by the BIA on Feb. 7, 2005, pending final disposition of her case.</li><br><br>
    <li><b>Paul White aka Krishan Kumar:</b> He was disbarred from the practice 
      of law by the Supreme Court of Washington for submitting false or incomplete 
      information on applications for admission to two other state bars.  He was 
      immediately suspended by the BIA on Feb. 11, 2005, pending final disposition 
      of his case.</li><br><br>
    <li><b>Alex M. Sonson:</b> He was suspended from the practice of law for 90 
      days by the Supreme Court of Hawaii for misappropriation of funds.  He was 
      immediately suspended by the BIA on Feb. 14, 2005, pending final disposition 
      of his case.</li>
  </ul>
<p><b>Final Orders of Discipline</b><br>
The BIA issued Final Orders of Discipline against 
    the following attorneys:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Alfred L. Hansen:</b> He was suspended from the practice of law for 
      2 years by the Supreme Court of Louisiana for violating numerous rules of 
      professional conduct relating to an immigration matter.  He was immediately 
      suspended by the BIA on Jan. 10, 2005, pending final disposition of his 
      case. The final order of Feb. 14, 2005, suspends him from practice before 
      the immigration tribunals for 2 years, effective Jan. 10, 2005.</li><br><br>
    <li><b>Paul Alan Schelly:</b> He was suspended from the practice of law for 
      60 days by the Supreme Court of California for violating his previous disciplinary 
      probation.  He was immediately suspended by the BIA on Jan. 11, 2005, pending 
      final disposition of his case.  The final order of Feb. 14, 2005, suspends 
      him from practice before the immigration tribunals for 60 days, effective 
      Jan. 11, 2005.</li><br><br>
    <li><b>Eric Tarankow:</b> He was suspended from the practice of law for 2 
      years by the Supreme Court of California for violating numerous provisions 
      of the California Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Business 
      and Professions Code.  He was immediately suspended by the BIA on Jan. 10, 
      2005, pending final disposition of his case.  The final order of Feb. 14, 
      2005, suspends him from practice before the immigration tribunals for 2 
      years, effective Jan. 10, 2005.</li>
  </ul>
    <p align="left"><b>Background</b><br>
    <br>
    The Rules of Professional Conduct include provisions specifying grounds for 
    disciplinary action, requirements for receiving and investigating complaints, 
    and procedures for conducting hearings.&nbsp; The Rules also authorize the 
    BIA to suspend immediately a practitioner who has been subject to disbarment, 
    suspension, or resignation with an admission of misconduct as imposed by a 
    state or federal court, or who has been convicted of a serious crime, pending 
    a summary proceeding and final sanction. They are available on the EOIR website 
    at <a 
href="../../vll/fedreg/2000_2001/fr27jn00R.pdf">http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/fedreg/2000_2001/fr27jn00R.pdf</a>.</p>
  <p>EOIR announces these disciplinary actions to inform the public about practitioners 
    who are not authorized to represent any matter before an immigration tribunal.&nbsp; 
    EOIR also posts a "List of Suspended and Expelled Practitioners" on its website 
    at <a 
href="../../index.html">http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir</a> (near the bottom 
    of EOIR's home page).</p>

    Specifically, under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR interprets 
    and administers federal immigration laws by conducting immigration court proceedings, 
    appellate reviews, and administrative hearings. EOIR consists of three components: 
    the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge, which is responsible for managing 
    the numerous immigration courts located throughout the United States where 
    immigration judges adjudicate individual cases; the Board of Immigration Appeals, 
    which primarily conducts appellate reviews of immigration judge decisions; 
    and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, which adjudicates 
    immigration-related employment cases. EOIR is committed to providing fair, 
    expeditious, and uniform application of the nation's immigration laws in all 
    cases.</i><br>
