<abstract>
Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act
and the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is charged with determining if
the manufacture, use, or disposal of a chemical
will present an unreasonable risk of harm to the
environment.  While management decisions are often
based on protecting populations of organisms, the
Endangered Species Act requires that, in some
cases, managers must estimate the take of
individuals to determine if the loss of
individuals might adversely affect a population of
an endangered species or threatened species.   The
most direct assessment would be to determine the
sensitivity of a listed species to a particular
contaminant or perturbation.  However, this direct
approach would be time consuming and expensive
because it might require development of organism
culturing and handling procedures, some species
may not be amenable to culture. there might be
multiple species to be considered, and would be
contaminant specific.  It is not possible to test
all listed species that may need protection from
environmental contaminants.  Therefore, decisions
need to be made for listed species using toxicity
data obtained from standard test procedures and
using surrogate organisms typically tested  in
laboratory toxicity assessments (e.g. rainbow
trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, fathead minnow
Pimephales promelas, and the cladoceran
Ceriodaphnia dubia).  These surrogate species are
easily tested using standardized methods; however,
there is a concern that these species or
procedures may not adequately represent
populations of listed species. By evaluating the
sensitivity for a number of listed species, it is
possible to make generalizations regarding the
protection afforded listed species though standard
regulatory programs.  This research project had
two objectives: (1) determine the relative
sensitivity to contaminants of listed species
using standard acute toxicity tests; and (2)
determine the degree of protection afforded listed
fish speces through the use of standard species
used in whole effluent toxicity tests.  Previous
cooperative research conducted between EPA and the
U.S. Geological Survey primarily evaluated the
similarity in response to five chemicals with
different modes of action (carbaryl, copper,
4-nonylphenol, pentachlorophenol and permethrin)
between surrogate (rainbow trout and fathead
minnows) and listed species within the same
taxonomic family (Salmonidae, Cyprinidae) using
standard acute toxicity tests.  The present study
expands this data base by testing five additional
species with these five chemicals.  Species were
listed either by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS) or state agencies or were species
identified as surrogates in FWS Recovery Plans.
Organisms included: (1) the Family Percidae
fountain darter  (Etheostoma rubrum, Federally
listed), greenthroat darter (Etheostoma lepidum,
state listed - Texas); (2) the Family
Acipenseridae, shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus
platorynchus, identified as surrogate for the
Federally listed pallid sturgeon - Scaphirhynchus
albus); (3) the Family Poeciliidae, Gila topminnow
(Poeciliopsis occidentalis, Federally listed); and
(4) the Family Bufonidae, boreal toad tadpoles
(Bufo boreas, state listed - Colorado).  The data
that was generated indicates that in 96 hour acute
toxicity tests, if ranbow trout is used as a test
species, a species typically used in pesticide
registration or water quality criteria derivation,
those procedures which protect rainbow trout would
likely be protective of most listed aquatic fish
species.  If a safety factor is needed to estimate
96 hour LC50s for listed species, the data
indicates that 0.5 would be a conservative
estimator.  Also, if EPA water quality criteria
are recalculated by eliminating certain species
from the data set, such as rainbow trout, then
listed fish species might not be adequately
protected.

<purpose>
The objective of the present study was to expand
the acute toxicity database by conducting tests on
the same five chemicals with five additional
species.  The selection of species tested was
based on availability of listed organisms.

held in well water (alkalinity 258 mg/L as CaCO3,
hardness 286 mg/L as CaCO3, pH 7.8, 18 C) at the
Columbia Environmental Research Center until
acclimation began.  Before the start of a toxicity
test, organisms were acclimated for a total fo 96
hours (EPA 1975, ASTM 1998).  For the first 48
hours, organisms were acclimated to the test water
and temperature.  The test organisms were then
moved to clean containers and held for an
additional 48 hours at the test temperature in
100% test water.  Organisms were not fed during
the 48 hours of holding in 100% test water.

The chemicals used in testing were carbaryl,
copper, 4-nonylphenol, pentachlorophenol, and
permethrin.  Chemicals were selected to represent
different classes of chemical and modes of toxic
action.  Organic chemical stock solutions were
prepared by dissolving the chemical in reagent
grade acetone, whereas stock solutions for copper
were prepared by dissolving copper in deionied
water.  The maximum acetone concentration in any
test container was 0.05 mL/L.  Organic and
inorganic chemical stocks were analyzed to confirm
nominal concentrations.  Organic chemical analysis
was conducted at either Mississippi State Chemical
Laboratory (Mississippi State, MS) or ABC
Laboratories (Columbia, MO) using gas
chromatography.  Copper stocks were confirmed at
either the CERC or Mississippi State Chemical
Laboratory by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
Overall, the mean percent nominal concentration
was 110% (n=9), with a mean range of 63% (copper)
to 160% (permethrin). One 4-nonylphenol stock had
a percent nominal concentration of 320%.  However,
biological results from the tests using these
stocks were similar to tests conducted with other
4-nonylphenol stocks.  The investigators therefore
believe that the reported value for this sample is
incorrect and that percent recovery was not
included in the average percent of nominal
concentration.

Static acute toxicity tests were conducted in
basic accordance with procedures described in EPA
(1975) and ASTM (1998).  Exposures were conducted
in 19.6 L glass jars containing 15 L of test
solution. All tests were conducted at 22 degrees
Centigrade. Test water was resconstituted hard
water (alkalinity 110 to 120 mg/L as CaCO3,
hardness 160 to 180 mg/L as CaCO3 - ASTM 1998).
One study with the boreal toad was conducted in
CERC well water.  Tests were conducted under
ambient lighting.  The exposure series consisted
of six concentrations with a 60% dilution series
tested in duplicate (except for the tests with the
boreal toad, which were tested in triplicate).
When a solvent was used, both a solvent control
and a dilution water control were included for
each species.  Individual test series were
randomly assigned to a waterbath and location
within a waterbath (complete block design).
Fishes and tadpoles were counted into two groups
(3 to 5 organisms per group depending on
availability) and pooled for each exposure
replicate (7 to 10 organisms/replicate).
Mortality was the endpoint measured at 6, 12 24,
48, 72, and 96 h of exposure and was defined as
lack of movement for a 5 -s observation with the
unaided eye.  Dead animals were removed at each
observational time.  Carbaryl concentrations used
in the test conducted with the boreal toad
tadpoles were not high enough to estimate LC50
concentrations.  Subsequent testing with boreal
toad tadpoles was being peformed concurrently with
this study. In that testing, exposures were
conducted in the well water used for culture and
the carbaryl testing had a 70% dilution series.
All other conditions were similar.

Alkalinity, hardness, and pH were measured on each
batch of reconstituted water before the start of
the exposures.  Alkalinity and hardness of
reconstituted hard water were within suggested
ranges, but average pH (8.4) was slightly above
the suggested value of 8.0.  The pH was measured
on the control, low, medium, and high exposure
concentrations at 0 hours and in those same
treatments if organisms survived to 48 and 96
hours of exposure.  Any drop in dissolved oxygen
was isolated and interspersed throughout the
exposures.  However in toxicity tests with
shovelnose sturgeon, jars with acetone added
either as a control or as a chemical carrier had
low concentrations of dissolved oxygen at 48 hours
of exposure.  The low concentrations of dissolved
oxygen in those jars may have been the cause for
the mortalities observed in that test at 72 hours
of exposure.  For this reason, data generated from
toxicity tests with shovelnose sturgeon using
solvent carriers should be interpreted with
caution.  No toxicity data for shovelnose sturgeon
toxicity tests using acetone as a carrier solvent
beyond 48 hours of exposure.

The LC 50 and 95% confidence interval for each
test was usually calculated using probit analysis.
However, when probit analysis was not appropriate
(i.e., less than two partial mortalities), LC50's
and confidence intervals were calculated using
moving average or a non-linear interpolative
procedure (Stephan, 1977).  The LC50's and
confidence intervals were determined using nominal
concentrations.  For the present study, they did
not have multiple tests for the listed species.
Therefore to compare listed species responses to
rainbow trout, an overall LC50 and confidence
interval for each chemical was calculated for
rainbow trout by combining all replicates from the
six tests.  The LC50's for fountain darters,
greenthroat darters, shovenlnose sturgeon, gila
topminnow, and boreal toads calculated in the
present study were then compared to the overall
LC50 for rainbow trout.  Differences between
LC50's were tested for statistical significance
using the procedure described by Sprague and
Fogels (1976).
