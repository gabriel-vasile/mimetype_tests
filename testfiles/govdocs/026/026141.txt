DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING            :      Docket No. D 98-1


BEFORE: Jordan, Chairman; Marks, Riley, Verheggen and Beatty,
        Commissioners


                            DECISION

BY THE COMMISSION:

     This disciplinary proceeding arises under Rule 80 of the
Commission's Procedural Rules, 29 C.F.R. § 2700.80.[1]  On 
August 19, 1998, a Commission administrative law judge referred
to the Commission a matter which the judge believed may warrant
disciplinary proceedings.  The substance of the referral
concerned guilty pleas entered by the representative of an
operator in civil penalty proceedings to criminal violations of
mandatory safety and health standards as well as to provisions
of Title 18 of the United States Code.  On the grounds explained
below, we conclude that disciplinary proceedings are not
warranted at this time and we dismiss without prejudice the
disciplinary referral.

     This matter arises in connection with a civil penalty
proceeding, Durbin Coal, Inc., Docket No. WEVA 98-65, that is
currently pending before Administrative Law Judge William Fauver.
In that proceeding, the operator contested various aspects of
three MSHA civil penalty assessments on March 26, 1998.  Contest
of Civil Penalties, Ex. A.  On May 5, the Secretary filed a
Petition for Assessment of Civil Penalty as well as discovery.
On June 1, an Answer to Discovery Request and Answer to Petition
for Assessment of Penalty were filed on behalf of Durbin Coal,
Inc. ("Durbin") by Connie J. Prater, "Consultant," on the
letterhead of "Pra-Mac Enterprises Inc."

     On June 15, 1998, the Secretary filed a Motion to Strike and
Motion for Default, in which the Secretary asked the judge to
strike the answers filed by Prater and to then find Durbin in
default, or in the alternative for an order requiring Prater to
"explain the manner by which she has satisfied the requirements
of 29 C.F.R. § 2700.3."[2]  S. Mot. to Strike and Mot. for
Default at 3.  By filings dated June 22 and June 29, 1998, the
Secretary supplemented and amended her motion.  Attached to the
motion, as amended and supplemented, was a copy of a criminal
information filed on January 12, 1995, by the United States
Attorney in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Kentucky.  S. Mot. to Suspend Discovery and Mot.
to Supplement, Addendum to Ex. B.  The information alleged
that Prater willfully violated 30 C.F.R. §§ 70.201, 70.207 
and 70.208, as well as Mine Act section 110(d),[3] 30 
U.S.C. § 820(d), the criminal penalty provision of the Mine
Act, by submitting to MSHA on behalf of various mines
respirable dust samples that "were fabricated outside of the
mines or were otherwise not taken in accordance with the
requirements of the Mine Safety Act."  Id. at 1-2.  Exhibit B to
the Secretary's motion to strike was a judgment in United States
v. Prater, Case No. 95-2-1 (E.D. Ky.), entered against Prater on
April 19, 1995, for violation of 30 U.S.C. § 820(d) based on her
plea of guilty to the information.  Also attached to the motion
was a copy of a judgment in United States v. Pra-Mac Enterprises,
Case No. 94-26-S-1 (E.D. Ky.), entered against Pra-Mac
Enterprises ("Pra-Mac") on April 18, 1995, for violation of 18
U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1001 based on its pleas of guilty to "count two
of superseding indictment."  S. Mot. to Strike and Mot. for
Default, Ex. A.  The indictment was not attached, but the offense
is described in the judgment as "Willfully & knowingly falsify,
conceal, & cover up & cause to be falisified [sic], concealed &
covered up, material facts by submitting fraudulent respirable
dust samples to [MSHA]; Aiding and Abetting[.]"[4]

     In her motion, the Secretary complained that Durbin had
failed to comply with Rule 3 of the Commission's Procedural
Rules.  S. Mot. to Strike and Mot. for Default at 1.  The
Secretary asserted that Prater is not an attorney admitted to
practice in Kentucky or West Virginia, and that she is not
otherwise authorized to practice before the Commission under Rule
3.  Id. at 1-2.  The Secretary noted the guilty pleas of Prater
and Pra-Mac and suggested that "the judge withhold permission for
Connie Prater to represent Respondent or any other party before
the Commission."  S. Amend't to Mot. to Strike and Mot. for
Default at 1-2.  She also argued that permission for Prater to
represent Durbin should be denied because "Pra-Mac Enterprises
Inc., the representative of Durbin Coal Incorporated through
Prater . . . , pled guilty to a crime of moral turpitude
implicating its tendency for truthfulness, and, thus, the judge
and the Secretary have reason to question the reliability of any
assertions in its pleadings."  Id. at 2.  In addition, the
Secretary contended that, given Rule 80's authorization of
disciplinary proceedings against an individual "who is practicing
or has practiced before the Commission on grounds that such
person has engaged in unethical or unprofessional conduct," the
judge should not permit Prater to enter her appearance pursuant
to Rule 3.  Id. at 2 n.1*.

     The firm of Patton Boggs, L.L.P. entered its appearance on
behalf of respondent Durbin, and on July 1, 1998, filed Durbin's
opposition to the Secretary's motion.  Durbin asserted that it
authorized Prater in writing to act as its agent in filings with
MSHA and that she has submitted "dozens of plans and other
documents to MSHA on behalf of Durbin."  D. Opp'n at 3.  Durbin
stressed that the guilty pleas of Prater and Pra-Mac were the
result of a plea bargain.  Id. at 4, 6.  It denied that either
defendant was guilty of a crime of moral turpitude.  Id.  In
explanation of Prater's failure to seek permission to practice
before the Commission, Durbin stated that she was told by MSHA
officials that she did not need to obtain counsel to contest
citations on behalf of her clients.  Id. at 4-5.  Durbin also
asserted that Prater entered appearances in the past by "filing
Answers before the Commission in exactly the same way she did in
this case, and those appearances have been routinely accepted
without comment."  Id. at 5.  Durbin argued that the Commission
has routinely accepted the appearance of non-attorneys under Rule
3, and that an investigation of the background of applicants
under that rule would be inappropriate.  Id. at 6.  Durbin also
contended that any inappropriate conduct may only be examined
pursuant to a disciplinary referral under Rule 80.  Id. at 7.  In
this connection, Durbin suggested that the judge consider
referring to the Commission under Rule 80 alleged misconduct of
the Solicitor, consisting of his asserted "misreading of the law,
and other unsubstantiated or wrong claims," as well as his
alleged failure to "check[] his facts" and his purported
"slander[ of Prater's] reputation and integrity."  Id. at 7-9.
Durbin asserted that, under Rule 80, only misconduct occurring in
the litigation before the Commission, and not a representative's
past conduct, has been a basis for a disciplinary proceeding
before the Commission.  Id. at 8.  Durbin requested that Prater
be allowed to represent it in the civil penalty proceeding.  Id.

     To date, the judge has not ruled on the Secretary's motion
to strike or Durbin's motion under Rule 3 to permit Prater to
represent it.  On August 18, 1998, the judge made the instant
disciplinary referral, attaching the criminal information and
judgments submitted by the Secretary in the civil penalty
proceeding.  According to the judge, those documents "contain
information that may warrant disciplinary proceedings against
Connie Prater, who practices before this Commission."  Disc.
Referral at 1.

     In our view, this disciplinary referral is premature.
Because the referral was made before the completion of the
underlying proceeding, the civil penalty docket continues before
the judge.   Under Rule 3(b)(4), non-attorneys and individuals
not described in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) are required
to obtain permission from the presiding judge or the Commission
to practice before this agency.  The judge has yet to rule on
Durbin's request under Rule 3 that Prater be allowed to represent
it.  Thus, it has yet to be determined whether Prater will be
practicing before the Commission in the matter that gave rise to
this referral.  Depending on the outcome of Durbin's request to
permit Prater to practice, the Rule 80 proceeding may become
moot.  In any event, we conclude it is unwise for the
disciplinary proceeding to continue while the Rule 3 question is
still pending, given the possibly overlapping nature of the two
matters.

     Accordingly, we terminate this disciplinary referral without
prejudice, and express no opinion on whether Prater's guilty
pleas warrant disciplinary proceedings under Rule 80.

          rules or an order of the  Commission  or  its
          Judges; has been disbarred or suspended by  a

          Judge  or  other  person having knowledge  of
          circumstances that  may  warrant disciplinary
          proceedings  against  an  individual  who  is
          practicing  or  has  practiced   before   the
          Commission  shall  forward  to the Commission

               (2)  Inquiry  by  the  Commission.   The
          Commission    shall    conduct   an   inquiry
          concerning a disciplinary  referral and shall
          determine  whether  disciplinary  proceedings
          are  warranted.  The Commission  may  require
          persons  to  submit  affidavits setting forth
          their  knowledge  of relevant  circumstances.
          If    the    Commission    determines    that
          disciplinary proceedings are  not  warranted,
          it  shall  issue  an  order  terminating  the
          referral.

          Commission's Chief  Administrative  Law Judge
          shall  assign  the  matter  to a Judge, other
          than  the  referring Judge, for  hearing  and
          decision. . . .
