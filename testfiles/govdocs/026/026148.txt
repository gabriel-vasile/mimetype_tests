          OPINION OF THE COMMISSION

               REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION -- REVIEW OF
               ASSOCIATION ACTION

                    Jurisdiction to Review Action of Association

               Customer's disciplinary complaint against member firm of
               registered securities association and associated person,
               contending that firm and associated person had violated
               association rules, was dismissed by association after
               conclusion of proceedings in which no violation was found.
               Held, the matter is not reviewable by the Commission because
               the dismissal of such a complaint is not among the actions
               enumerated in Section 19(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
               of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d), and application for review is
               dismissed.

          APPEARANCES:

               Russell A. Simpson, pro se.

               Alden S. Adkins, Norman Sue, Jr., and Susan L. Beesley, for
          NASD Regulation, Inc.

               Peter W. Schneider and Kevin E. Broyles, of Rogers & Hardin,
          for Pierre M. Koutani and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.

          Appeal lodged:  December 11, 1997
          Last brief received:  March 30, 1998

                                          I.

               Russell A. Simpson, a former customer of Bear, Stearns & Co.
          Inc. ("Bear Stearns"), a member firm of the National Association
          of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), seeks review of NASD
          action.  The NASD dismissed a complaint filed by Simpson against
          Bear Stearns and Pierre Koutani, formerly a registered
          representative with Bear Stearns who handled Simpson's account.
          Simpson contends both that Bear Stearns and Koutani violated NASD
          rules, and that the NASD and its subsidiary NASD Regulation, Inc.
          ("NASDR") failed to enforce those rules. [1]  As discussed below,
          we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction under Section
          19(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"),
          15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(2), to review this matter. [2]


                                         II.

               At the time of the events at issue, Article IV, Section 2 of
          the NASD Rules of Fair Practice provided that any person feeling
          aggrieved by an act of an NASD member or associated person that
          he or she believed to be in violation of those rules could file a
          complaint, using a form to be supplied by the Board of Governors,
          and that any such complaint would be handled in accordance with
          the NASD Code of Procedure.  Article IV, Section 2 subsequently
          became NASD Rule 8120.  Rule 8120 was eliminated in 1997 when the
          Commission approved new rules governing the NASD disciplinary
          process. [3]

               On April 10, 1994, Simpson wrote to the NASD's District
          Business Committee for District Number 7 (the "District
          Committee"), identifying his letter as "a formal complaint under
          Article IV, Section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice" against
          Bear Stearns and Koutani.  Simpson asserted that Bear Stearns and
          Koutani had violated the NASD Rules of Fair Practice in
          connection with securities transactions in October and November
          1993.  He contended that Koutani had misrepresented the
          price/earnings ratio of a stock that Koutani had recommended;
          that Bear Stearns and Koutani had recommended the purchase and
          subsequent sale of that stock to him without any reasonable
          grounds for believing that those recommendations were suitable;
          and that Bear Stearns and Koutani had not given proper notice
          that, as a market maker in that stock, it was the seller of the
          shares Simpson purchased and the repurchaser of the shares he
          later sold.

               Although Simpson indicated that he intended his letter as a
          formal complaint, he did not, as the rule required, use the form
          provided for such complaints.  The District Committee therefore
          did not treat the letter as a formal complaint.  Rather, the
          District Committee considered it in accordance with former
          Article I, Section 4 of the NASD Code of Procedure, which
          provided that communications received from any person regarding
          any grievance against an NASD member or associated person "may be
          dealt with by the [NASD] as it considers to be fair and proper
          under the circumstances." [4]  After an investigation, the NASD
          staff determined that no disciplinary action was warranted.
          Simpson expressed dissatisfaction with this outcome, and an
          examination subcommittee of the District Committee then reviewed
          the staff's report of investigation and determined to take no
          further action.
          
               Still dissatisfied, Simpson filed a formal complaint against
          Bear Stearns and Koutani.  Simpson conducted the prosecution of
          the complaint.  After a hearing at which four witnesses testified
          and more than 60 exhibits were introduced into evidence, the
          District Committee found that Simpson failed to sustain his
          burden of proof as to any of the violations.  It therefore
          dismissed the complaint.

               Simpson appealed the District Committee's dismissal to the
          National Business Conduct Committee ("National Committee").
          Following a hearing, the National Committee instructed the
          District Committee to clarify its findings as to one of the three
          causes alleged in the complaint, and retained jurisdiction over
          the entire matter pending receipt of that clarification.  The
          National Committee found that the first District Committee
          response was inadequate and ordered further clarification.  After
          receiving this additional clarification from the District
          Committee and reviewing the record and the arguments made on
          appeal, the National Committee affirmed the dismissal of
          Simpson's complaint in its entirety.  Simpson then sought our
          review.


                                         III.

               Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1),
          requires, among other things, that the NASD file notice with the
          Commission of any action by which it:  (1) imposes any final
          disciplinary sanction on any member or person associated with a
          member; (2) denies membership or participation to an applicant;
          (3) prohibits or limits any person in respect to access to
          services offered by the NASD or an NASD member; or (4) bars any
          person from becoming associated with a member.  Exchange Act
          Section 19(d)(2) authorizes our review of any action as to which
          notice is required to be filed with us under Section 19(d)(1) on
          our own motion or upon application of any person aggrieved
          thereby. [5]  Although we have not previously considered whether
          we can review actions in which a formal complaint brought by
          a customer was dismissed by the NASD with no finding of
          violation, [6] we have considered the extent of Commission
          jurisdiction to hear appeals from other types of actions by self-
          regulatory organizations ("SROs") such as the NASD.  Based on
          those earlier rulings, we conclude that we do not have
          jurisdiction here under Section 19(d).

               A.  This is not an action in which the NASD imposed a "final
          disciplinary sanction."  We have previously defined a
          disciplinary action as an action that responds to an alleged
          violation of an SRO rule or Commission statute or rule,
          or an action in which a punishment or sanction is sought or
          intended. [7]  Under this definition, the proceeding initiated by
          Simpson's complaint was unquestionably disciplinary in nature:
          it was held in response to Simpson's allegations that NASD rules
          had been violated, and Simpson asked that Koutani and Bear
          Stearns be sanctioned.  Section 19(d) does not, however, grant
          us jurisdiction to review disciplinary actions generally, but
          only over those in which a final disciplinary sanction is
          imposed.  Here, the NASD imposed no sanction; indeed, it found no
          violation on which a sanction could be based.

               Simpson relies on Rule 19d-1(c)(1), 17 C.F.R.
          240.19d-1(c)(1), which requires SROs to report to us "any final
          disciplinary action" that "after notice and opportunity for
          hearing, results in any final disposition of charges of:  (1) one
          or more violations of (A) the rules of [an SRO]."  Because this
          proceeding resulted in final disposition of charges of violations
          of rules of an SRO, he contends that we have jurisdiction to
          review it.

               Simpson's reliance on this rule, however, is misplaced.
          Rule 19d-1(c)(1) requires that dismissals of disciplinary actions
          be reported to us so that we may more effectively carry out our
          responsibilities for oversight of the SROs. [8]  The rule does
          not expand our review jurisdiction under Section 19(d), which
          allows appeals only where disciplinary actions result in
          imposition of final disciplinary sanctions. [9]

               B.  We also conclude that the NASD's action did not prohibit
          or limit Simpson in respect to access to services offered by the
          NASD. [10]  Simpson's interaction with the NASD was through his
          involvement in seeking disciplinary action against Koutani and
          Bear Stearns.  We do not view permitting any person to file a
          complaint against an NASD member or associated person and
          conducting any resulting proceeding as offering a "service" for
          purposes of Section 19(d). [11]

               Even if the NASD were deemed to be offering a service under
          Section 19(d), however, it did not limit or prohibit Simpson's
          access to that service.  Simpson's informal complaint was
          investigated and considered by NASD staff, and the staff's
          recommendation was then reviewed by the District Committee.  His
          formal complaint was given full consideration:  a hearing before
          the District Committee, an appeal to the National Committee, and
          two remands to the District Committee for clarification before
          the issuance of the National Committee decision.

               C.  The remaining two prongs of Section 19(d) are easily
          dealt with.  Simpson did not apply for membership in the NASD,
          nor did he seek to become associated with a member.  Questions of
          denial of membership or bar from association are therefore not
          raised.


                                         IV.

               A.  As an alternative to Section 19(d), Simpson asks us to
          review the NASD's decision on our own initiative under Rule 400,
          421, or 430 of our Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. 201.400,
          201.421, or 201.430.  None of these rules is applicable.  Rule
          400 pertains to the interlocutory review of rulings of hearing
          officers, and Rule 430 provides for our review of actions taken
          pursuant to authority delegated to Commission staff in 17 C.F.R.
          200.30-1 through 200.30-18.  Neither of these applies to our
          review of SRO proceedings.

               Rule 421 allows us to review on our own initiative any
          determination by an SRO that could be subject to an application
          for review under Rule 420.  But the SRO determinations to which
          Rule 420 applies are those enumerated in Section 19(d)(1), and as
          discussed above, the NASD's action here does not fall within that
          section.

               B.  Simpson contends that there were numerous "abuses" in
          the way the NASD and NASDR handled his complaints.  Because
          19(d) gives us no jurisdiction over this review proceeding,
          however, we cannot consider Simpson's procedural issues in this
          context. [12]


          **FOOTNOTES**

          [1]: Simpson  states  that  "[i]t  is  not  the  purpose  of this
               application  for  review  to  seek  disciplinary  sanctions"
               against Bear Stearns and Koutani.  Rather, he claims that he
               wishes us to find that Bear Stearns and Koutani violated the
               NASD's rules.

               [2]:As  an  initial  matter,  Bear Stearns and Koutani  have
               filed a motion for leave to file  a  Brief  in Opposition to
               Simpson's Application for Review.  Bear Stearns  and Koutani
               contend  that  they  have a high degree of interest in  this
               proceeding, since they  would  be  affected  by its outcome.
               They  contend  that  it  would  be  unfair to deny them  the
               opportunity to defend themselves.  Simpson  does  not oppose
               the motion.

               As  discussed  below,  after  an evidentiary hearing and  an
               appeal, the NASD found that Simpson failed to establish
               that Koutani and Bear Stearns had  violated  NASD  rules  as
               alleged  in  his  complaint.   It  therefore  dismissed  the
               complaint,  and  Simpson  sought our review.  The parties to
               this review proceeding are thus Simpson, as applicant,
               and the NASD.  Under Rule 210(f)  of  our Rules of Practice,
               17 C.F.R. 201.210(f), however, we may allow a non-party to
               participate on a limited basis in a proceeding  to  review a
               determination  by a self-regulatory organization if we  deem
               it necessary or appropriate in the public interest.  We deem
               it  appropriate  to   allow  Bear  Stearns  and  Koutani  to
               participate by filing their brief.

               [3]:In  light  of  the  rule   amendments,   which  included
               implementing   staff-initiated   disciplinary   proceedings,
               enhancing  the  arbitration  process,  and  instituting   an
               expanded and independent NASD internal review function, this
               Commission  agreed  with  the  NASD  that  it  was no longer
               necessary  to accord aggrieved persons the right  to  invoke
               NASD processes to initiate formal disciplinary actions.  See
               Exchange Act  Rel.  No. 38908 (August 7, 1997), 62 Fed. Reg.
               43,385, 43,401 (1997).

               [4]:Article I, Section 4 subsequently became NASD Rule 9111,
               and was later eliminated.

               [5]:Because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction, we do not
               reach the question whether  Simpson  was  "aggrieved" within
               the meaning of Section 19(d)(2).  See Daniel M. Pecoraro, 48
               S.E.C.  875,  875  n.1 (1987) (dismissing appeal  of  entity
               against whom no findings  were made and on whom no sanctions
               were imposed, on grounds that it was not "aggrieved").

               [6]:We have exercised review  jurisdiction over appeals from
               NASD disciplinary actions initiated  by  customer complaints
               where  those actions resulted in findings of  violation  and
               the imposition  of final disciplinary sanctions.  In each of
               those  instances,   the  appeal  was  filed  by  the  person
               disciplined.  See Stephen  Investment  Securities,  Inc., 51
               S.E.C. 604 (1993), aff'd, Stephen Investment Secs., Inc.  v.

               Docket  1107, 1111 (noting that reports of dismissals  "have
               been demonstrably  valuable  to the Commission in overseeing
               NASD regulatory performance").   Reports  of  dismissals are
               required  pursuant  to the Commission's power under  Section
               17(a) of the Exchange  Act, 15 U.S.C.  78q(a).  Id., 12 SEC
               Docket at 1111 n.5.

               [9]:We noted the distinction  between  the  scope of Section
               19(d)(1)  and the scope of Rule 19d-1 when we  adopted  Rule
               19d-1:   "While  Section  19(d)(1)  of  the  [Exchange]  Act
               appears to  require  the  SRO  to report only proceedings in
               which sanctions were imposed, Rule  19d-1  requires SRO's to
               file notices of both the imposition of sanctions  as well as
               the dismissal of charges."  Id., 12 SEC Docket at 1111.   We
               further noted that, because Section 19(d)(1) did not mandate
               all   the   reports   that  our  oversight  responsibilities
               required,  it  was  necessary  to  include  the  concept  of
               "disciplinary actions" in Rule 19d-1 to ensure that we would
               obtain information about  dismissals,  among  other  things.

               [10]:Although Section 19(d) also gives us jurisdiction  over
               NASD  actions  involving  limitations  on access to services
               offered by NASD members, access to services  offered by Bear
               Stearns is not an issue here.

               communication  between  floor and non-members was denial  of

               Rel. No. 39459 (December 17, 1997),  66 SEC Docket 351, 356-
               57 (reviewing cases in which denial of  access  to  services
               was found).

          [12]:Simpson  also urges us to institute proceedings against  the
               NASD and/or  NASDR  based  on what he terms their failure to
               enforce the NASD's rules.  Our decision whether to institute
               such proceedings is a separate  matter  from our disposition
               of this review proceeding.
                                          V.

               For the reasons discussed above, we have concluded that the
          NASD's decision to dismiss Simpson's complaint is not reviewable
          by this Commission under the Exchange Act.  We accordingly
          dismiss Simpson's application.

               An appropriate order will issue. [13]

               By the Commission (Chairman LEVITT and Commissioners
          JOHNSON, HUNT, CAREY and UNGER).
