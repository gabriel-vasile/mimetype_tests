Introduction

This inventory provides brief synopses of 52
residential boot camps and their aftercare
provisions. The boot camp programs include: 34
adult programs run by State correctional agencies
in 32 States; 8 local programs operated by
sheriff's departments or local probation or
correctional departments; the program operated by
the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Texas and
Pennsylvania; and 9 juvenile programs operated by
a variety of public and private youth agencies. 
 
The study employed a three-tiered process to
identify and describe aftercare programming for
boot camps:

o  Telephone interviews with extant juvenile and
adult boot camps. Interviews were conducted with
representatives from all 52 boot camp programs
and, in most cases, with representatives from the
aftercare programs. The list of programs drew upon
three sources: State programs were identified from
a 1993 survey of the 50 States and the District of
Columbia conducted by the American Institute for
Research (AIR) to determine the number of
operational and planned boot camps; local programs
were identified from Austin, Hones, and Bolyard's
(1993) review of jail boot camps; and juvenile
programs were identified from a survey conducted
by the Institute for Criminological Research
(1992). The group represents the vast majority of
boot camps then in existence. Because this study
does not address the prevalence of boot camps, no
systematic attempt was made to determine if
additional programs were in operation. Several new
programs were not included because the aftercare
segment of the program was not developed. 

o  Reviews of program documentation to produce
individual case summaries. Information from the
interviews and from written materials was combined
to create individual case summaries for each
program, which were then submitted to program
staff for their review. Each of the program
summaries was approved by a representative from
the program.

o  Site visits to selected programs. Site visits
were conducted at three boot camps -- the
Minnesota Challenge Incarceration Program, the
Herman L. Toulson Correctional Boot Camp in
Maryland, and the Kentucky First Incarceration
Shock Treatment Program -- and the aftercare
programs located in the proximate urban areas of
Minneapolis, Baltimore, and Louisville. 

A companion document, A National Survey of
Aftercare Provisions for Boot Camp Graduates,
provides a synthesis of boot camp aftercare
provisions, highlighting several innovative
program features. 

The inventory is intended to serve as a resource
tool for practitioners interested in the aftercare
programs and arrangements of other boot camp
programs. Each synopsis includes:

Alabama: Disciplinary Rehabilitation Program

Jurisdiction: State of Alabama

Program Goals:

o  Divert younger, first-felony offenders from
long-term incarceration into a regimented, short-
term period of punishment in a restrictive
setting.

o  Improve offenders' behavior upon their return
to the community.

o  Encourage younger offenders to accept
responsibility for their criminal activities and
impress upon them society's unwillingness to
condone criminal behavior.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders with no previous incarceration
in an adult correctional facility. 

o  Offenders with sentences of 1 to 15 years.

o  No offenders convicted of murder; first-degree
rape; kidnaping; sodomy; arson; robbery; enticing
a child to enter a vehicle, house, etc., for
immoral purposes. No offenders with life
conviction without parole.

Boot Camp:

The Alabama Department of Corrections (DOC) opened
the "Disciplinary Rehabilitation Unit" (Boot Camp)
at the Childersburg Community Work Center in 1988.
The program normally lasts for 90 days but can be
extended to 180 days. With a total capacity of
180, the program accepts new platoons of about 60
inmates each month. Judges sentence offenders
directly to the program pending the outcome of DOC
medical and psychological screening. Although
there is no specified age limit for program
participation, judges have sentenced offenders
between the ages of 14 and 37 to the boot camp.
The total budget in FY 94 was $2,443,983, an
estimated cost per inmate, per month of $835. 

Program activities include physical training,
military drill and ceremony, hard labor, and
counseling. Adult basic education, literacy, and
pre-GED classes are mandatory for any inmate
without a high school diploma or a GED. Drill
instructors focus on developing self-discipline,
self-confidence, and social conformity in each
inmate. The treatment staff use rational
decisionmaking/reality therapy to provide
addictive behavior/substance abuse and
interpersonal skills/socialization counseling. 

Since the program started, 2,696 offenders have
been sentenced to the program, 2,098 of whom
graduated from the boot camp, for a 78-percent
success rate. Fifty-seven percent of the
nongraduates were dismissed for behavior problems,
and close to a third were released for medical
reasons.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The boot camp program sends a report to the
sentencing court for each graduate. After
successfully completing the program, offenders
return to the sentencing judge for resentencing.
The majority are placed on probation. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

No special staff is designated to monitor boot
camp graduates, and no special requirements exist
for their treatment.

Supervision:
The majority of the boot camp graduates are placed
on regular probation.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Of the 2,098 graduates, 584 (27.8 percent) have
subsequently returned to Department of Corrections
custody. About 59 percent of the returns are for
new crimes; the remainder are for technical
violations.

Arizona: Shock Incarceration Program

Jurisdiction:  State of Arizona

Program Goals:

o  Divert youthful offenders from incarceration,
saving prison beds and reducing costs.

o  Shock youthful offenders with a preview of
prison life.

o  Instill and promote self-reliance, self-
confidence, self-discipline, self-respect, respect
for and adherence to authority, respect for
others, teamwork skills, responsibility, and pride
in accomplishment.

o  Promote personal growth by developing a work
ethic and acquiring personal hygiene habits and
social skills.

o  Enhance offenders' physical and mental health.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and females between the ages of 18 and 25.

o  No prior adult incarceration.

o  No obvious or known contagious or communicable
disease or physical limitation.

o  If sentenced as a condition of probation,
eligible for intensive probation and convicted of
a Class 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 felony.

o  If referred from the Department of Corrections
(DOC): a maximum sentence of 7 years, a
nondangerous, nonrepetitive designation, and a
conviction for a Class 3, 4, 5, or 6 felony.

o  DOC inmates must volunteer for the program.

Boot Camp:

Following the passage of an Arizona law permitting
the development of a boot camp as a condition of
intensive probation in 1988, DOC opened its 150-
bed Shock Incarceration Program (SIP) at the
medium-security east unit in the Arizona State
Prison Complex in Florence. Two years later the
legislature authorized the placement of inmates
from within the prison center at the boot camp.
Diversions from prison currently account for about
5 percent of the boot camp population. 

Inmates enter the 120-day boot camp in platoons of
about 24. Participants, sentenced by a judge to
the shock program as a condition of probation, are
screened by an adult probation officer and held in
a preshock compound for eligibility screening for
up to 45 days or until the next platoon entry
date. 

Inmates who are recommended for shock
incarceration by a correctional supervisor are
interviewed by the Shock Incarceration Committee.
They are held at a different facility until the
next platoon entry date.

Inmates progress through four phases lasting
approximately 1 month each. The intensive, 17-hour
daily schedule employs a military model: drill and
ceremony; physical training; education (ABE, GED,
typing); substance-abuse training; anger
management; discipline; work; and life skills
training. Removal from the Shock Incarceration
Program can occur as the result of medical
illness, disciplinary problems, or court-ordered
sentence amendment. About 60 percent of the
participants graduate from the program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

SIP graduates are placed into one of two different
aftercare programs, depending on their original
boot camp referrals. Graduates who had been
sentenced to boot camp as a condition of probation
are released on intensive probation in their
counties of origin. Graduates placed in SIP by DOC
are granted inmate release status.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The county intensive probation offices are
responsible for the boot camp graduates released
on probation, and DOC operates the shock release
program. An average caseload for a parole officer
is 85 parolees.

Supervision:

For the first 90 days of aftercare, shock
releasees supervised by the Parole Division of DOC
are placed on home arrest and receive electronic
monitoring. Subsequently, they are placed on
general supervision and are required to maintain a
minimum of two face-to-face contacts per week with
their parole officers. 

Shock probationers released into all counties,
except Maricopa, are placed under the same
supervisory requirements as other county
probationers. They are assigned to a probation
officer's caseload. In Maricopa County, where the
probation office runs the aftershock program, boot
camp graduates are placed in a community house
arrest program or a transitional shock house for
90 to 120 days. An aftershock team decides where a
graduate is placed based on the graduate's
performance in boot camp, the nature of the
original crime, perceived risk to the community,
and family situation. All Maricopa shock
probationers are placed on a three-phased
intensive probation supervision program lasting
between 9 and 12 months. In the first 3 months of
aftercare, contact requirements are four times per
week. In the subsequent 3 months, the requirement
drops to three contacts per week, and for the
final 3 months, one contact per week.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

A Maricopa County probation officer is assigned to
the boot camp to work with offenders during the
residential phase. All inmates from other counties
are assigned to a probation officer's caseload.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The Department of Corrections does not provide any
special services to shock releasees except for 90
days of electronic monitoring.

Unless they are placed in Maricopa County, shock
probationers receive the same services that are
provided to regular probationers. In Maricopa, the
aftershock team develops individual treatment
plans for the graduates. Participants must
maintain full-time employment and provide 40 hours
of community service. Program activities in the
shock probation aftercare program include:
educational classes (GED, ABE, typing); parenting
classes; substance abuse classes; self-help
groups; family counseling; recreation; group
physical training; and random drug testing.

Evidence of Program Effects:

To date 1,341 offenders have graduated from the
Shock Incarceration Program. The Maricopa County
shock probation program reported an 88- percent
success rate for its aftercare graduates. The
Shock Incarceration Program reported a return-to-
prison rate of 32 percent since the program
started. Estimate dollar savings from the program
were $17,000 per year, per successful shock inmate
for the first sentence. The program also reported
that shock incarceree labor had provided the
community 30,000 hours of free labor and 80,000
hours of prison facility labor during a year.

Arkansas: Department of Corrections Boot Camp
Program

Jurisdiction:  State of Arkansas  

Program Goals:

o  Reintegrate inmates into society by changing
their attitudes, norms, and lifestyles.
o  Reduce recidivism.
o  Ease prison overcrowding.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male, first-term, nonviolent, nonsexual
offenders with less than 10-year sentences who are
eligible for minimum-security status.
o  Volunteer for program.
o  Medical clearance.

Boot Camp:

Since April 1990, the Arkansas Department of
Corrections has operated a 15-week, 150-bed boot
camp on the grounds of the Wrightsville
correctional facility. The boot camp strives to
build self-esteem, self-discipline, cooperation,
accountability, appropriate goals, and positive
attitudes by providing discipline, academic
education, substance abuse training, and mental
health counseling. Through these efforts the
program hopes to change criminal attitudes, norms,
and lifestyles and ultimately to reintegrate
inmates into productive roles in society. About 80
percent of participants graduate from the program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

At the 100th day of the residential program, a
committee of counselors, teachers, drill
instructors, the drill sergeant, the chief of
security, and the boot camp warden/administrator
reviews each participant's case and determines
eligibility for graduation. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

All boot camp graduates are released to the
supervision of the Arkansas Department of
Community Punishment. No separate aftercare
program for boot camp graduates is available. 

Supervision:
Boot camp graduates are assigned to regular parole
caseloads of about 58 parolees per parole officer.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The community aftercare program operated by the
Department of Community Punishment provides
intensive support and aftercare through counseling
services and referrals to community treatment for
releasees at high risk of returning to the drug
culture. Boot camp graduates are required to
attend 8 to 10 group counseling sessions. The
planned treatment referral program will provide
comprehensive statewide substance abuse
assessment/counseling treatment, mental health
assessment/ counseling/therapy, and transitional
living services to offenders. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

The Arkansas Boot Camp program reports a 16.7
percent recidivism rate for its graduates as
compared with the institutional rate of 38
percent.

California: San Quentin Boot Camp Alternative
Sentencing Program (ASP)

Jurisdiction:  State of California

Program Goal:

o  Serve as an alternative to long-term
incarceration for nonviolent offenders committed
to prison for the first time.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male volunteers from among offenders serving
first prison sentences of 12 to 36 months.

o  Perpetrators of offenses that include: second-
degree burglary, grand theft, vehicle theft, petty
theft with priors, receiving stolen property,
forgery/fraud, other property offenses, certain
controlled substance/marijuana offenses, driving
under the influence (DUI), and
involuntary/vehicular manslaughter.

o  No offenders with physical or mental
impairments, communicable diseases, or medical
problems.

o  No offenders who have a major hold or detainer.

Boot Camp:

The California Department of Corrections opened
the Alternative Sentencing Program (ASP) at the
San Quentin prison in 1993. The 120-day boot camp
for 176 males is based on the therapeutic
community approach. This multifaceted approach
includes: instruction in military bearing,
courtesy, discipline, and drills; physical
training; structured work programs; group and
individual therapy; drug and alcohol abuse
counseling; educational programming; reality
therapy; and community living skills. 

Approximately 80 percent of the participants
graduate from the boot camp and enter aftercare. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:
California Department of Corrections.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:
 
ASP has a two-tiered aftercare program. For the
first 60 days after graduation from boot camp,
participants enter a residential work furlough
program at one of two locations. Participants are
then released to their communities on intensive
parole supervision for 120 days. 

Supervision:

During the work furlough phase of aftercare,
participants reside at one of two work furlough
facilities. During this period they work in the
community for 40 hours a week and are supervised
at the work furlough facility during nonworking
hours. On successful completion of the work
furlough program, offenders are released on
intensive parole supervision for 120 days.
Intensive parole stresses employment, schooling,
and a continuation of reality therapy, along with
continued substance abuse programming. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The aftercare components, work training and
intensive parole, are considered integral parts of
the ASP program. Efforts are underway to integrate
the programming at boot camp and work training
sites. For instance, the boot camp commander
conducts training for residential facility staff,
work facility staff visit boot camp, and vice
versa. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

The intensive parole component stresses
employment, schooling/ training, and reality
therapy. Boot camp graduates are expected to
secure full-time employment while in aftercare. An
additional 30 hours per week is devoted to
rehabilitative program activities.
 
Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports that 80 percent of all boot
camp graduates have successfully completed the
aftercare program.

Colorado: Regimented Inmate Training Program

Jurisdiction:  State of Colorado 

Program Goals:

o  Reduce recidivism through alcohol and drug
abuse treatment.
o  Decrease prison-bed needs, prison overcrowding,
and incarceration cost in the Department of
Corrections.
o  Promote personal development and self-
discipline.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female nonviolent offenders between
the ages of 18 and 30. 
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders serving a sentence that was
reduced to a nonviolent offense as a result of a
plea bargain.
o  No offenders with a previous incarceration for
a violent offense.

Boot Camp:

The Colorado Regimented Inmate Training Program,
also known as the Colorado Correctional
Alternative Program (CCAP), is a 90-day military-
style boot camp that includes intensive physical
training and discipline. It has slots for 92 males
and 8 females at the Buena Vista Correctional
Facility.

Candidates are screened on arrival at the
reception center by the Colorado Department of
Corrections (CDOC) and must volunteer for the
program. Most are burglary or drug abuse offenders
with an average sentence length of 4.7 years. CCAP
excludes offenders who have served sentences for
violent offenses. A platoon of approximately 40
offenders enters each month. 

Each inmate is assigned a case manager who
oversees his/her needs and progress. About half of
the daily schedule is devoted to military-style
physical training and discipline. Considerable
emphasis is placed on drug and alcohol treatment,
with mandatory participation in a 96-hour
addiction recovery program, consisting of group
therapy and classroom study, that is run by a
certified drug and alcohol counselor. The program
also provides educational and vocational
assessment and job skill-related training. GED and
parenting classes are offered during the final 30
days. In addition, CCAP staff assist inmates in
establishing short- and long-term goals that they
can accomplish after release to their community. A
30-day transition period is provided to graduates
while they are waiting for sentence
reconsideration. 
 
About one-third of the 778 males and 36 females
admitted to CCAP since 1991 failed to complete the
program.

Females had a higher dropout rate than males (74
percent versus 32 percent). Program failures were
more likely to be nonwhites and have an extensive
history of juvenile incarceration. They were also
less likely to have been on probation or community
residential status.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Sentencing judges, district attorneys, and
probation departments receive a 30-day and a 60-
day performance report as well as recommendations
from CCAP staff regarding disposition. Graduates
are referred back to their sentencing judges for
sentence reconsideration. The majority of
jurisdictions have requested formal hearings to
reconsider the sentences, thereby extending the
time required to process offenders over the 120-
day statutory limitation for the program. As a
result, CDOC had to move graduates to other
facilities to await disposition of their cases. 

In the first 2 years of program operation, judges
agreed with recommendations from CCAP staff for
aftercare release dates and placement in only 45
percent of the cases. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

No special aftercare program is available. Inmates
may be released into community corrections,
intensive probation, standard probation, parole,
or have their sentences discharged.

Supervision:

As of July 15, 1993, 439 of the 539 graduates had
been released from prison. Forty-two percent of
the graduates were placed in community
corrections, 38 percent on intensive or regular
probation, and 16 percent on parole. The remaining
100 were still in the CDOC system awaiting parole
or sentence reconsideration. 

Aftercare Program Activities:
No special activities are offered to boot camp
graduates.

Evidence of Program Effects:
The rate of return to CDOC after release was 34.7
percent for boot camp graduates, compared with
29.9 percent for a comparison group. The CDOC
cautions that these data reflect only a few months
of time out of the program and may look different
in a 2- or 3-year followup.

CDOC estimated that boot camp had resulted in
operating cost savings of nearly $2 million and
capital construction cost avoidance of more than
$4 million. However, sentence reductions for CCAP
graduates had only a minimal effect on the length
of time served. Only 2 out of 27 offenders who had
their sentences reduced were released on their
earliest release date.

Florida: Basic Training Program

Jurisdiction: State of Florida

Program Goals:

o  Divert selected youth offenders from long
periods of incarceration.
o  Provide inmates with the opportunity to become
involved in the decisionmaking process concerning
their futures.
o  Instill confidence, self-respect,
responsibility, and pride in accomplishments.
o  Promote the development of self-discipline
through the military model of treatment.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male, first-time offenders between the ages of
15 and 24.
o  Offenders serving sentences of 10 years or
less.
o  Offenders with no capital or life felonies,
minimum mandatory sentences, or any sex offense.
o  Offenders sentenced under the Youthful Offender
Act.
o  Offenders with no physical or psychological
limitations.

Boot Camp:

The Florida Department of Corrections started the
Basic Training Program at the Sumter Correctional
Institution in Bushnell, Florida, in 1987. The
program has a capacity of 100 inmates.
Participants enter as platoons and stay for 90 to
120 days. Staff include 13 drill
instructors/platoon supervisors, 14 housing
officers and supervisors, two human services
counselors, and five supervisory correctional
officers. 

Candidates are identified at the Department of
Corrections reception centers. The department
requests approval from the sentencing court to
place eligible inmates into the boot camp. The
program employs shock incarceration training
techniques such as intense physical training,
military drill, verbally aggressive confrontation,
and summary punishment to change youthful offender
behavior. Offenders follow a prescribed schedule 6
days a week from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m. that includes:
an hour of physical training, more than an hour of
education and employability skills, 4 hours of
work detail, more than 2 hours of challenge
activities, an hour of group or individual
counseling, and 3 hours of military drill.

As of May 1994, the program had admitted 2,442
inmates, of which 49.2 percent had graduated and
another 4 percent were still enrolled. A third of
the inmates had been dismissed as program
failures, and 1 out of 11 was dismissed for
medical reasons.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

On completion of the program, the Department of
Corrections provides the sentencing court with a
performance report for each graduate. If
performance were satisfactory, the court issues an
order modifying the sentence and placing the
graduate on probation for the remainder of his
sentence.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing: 

Currently, there is neither a special aftercare
program nor probation staff designated
specifically for boot camp graduates. However, the
Florida Legislature recently mandated the
development of an aftercare program for the boot
camp graduates. Beginning July 1, 1995, boot camp
graduates will spend 4 to 6 months in community
residential centers before they are released to
their communities. They will then serve the
remainder of their sentences on probation in their
counties of origin.

Supervision:
Currently, most boot camp graduates are on regular
probation supervision.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Between 1987 and 1992, 820 offenders successfully
completed the boot camp program. During the
initial year following release from prison, 218 of
these graduates were recommitted to State prisons,
resulting in a recommitment rate of 26.6 percent.
Accounting for the return to prison was either a
conviction for one or more new offenses, generally
felonies, or a violation of rules governing
behavior while under formal supervision in the
community.

Georgia: Inmate and Probation Boot Camps

Jurisdiction: State of Georgia 

Program Goals:

o  Protect the public.
o  Ease overcrowding in State prisons and thereby
end the prison early release program.
o  Begin a process of change in offenders'
attitudes and behaviors through an intense prison
experience and personal development program.
o  Reduce costs by using offender facilities that
are less expensive to construct than prisons and
by serving more offenders because of the shorter
incarceration.

Eligibility Criteria:

Georgia Inmate Program
o  Males, 35 years or younger.
o  Sentenced to 10 years or less or convicted of a
felony. 
o  No violent offenders.

Georgia Probation Program
o  Between the ages of 17 and 30.
o  Physically and mentally capable of
participating in the program.
o  Males (planning to develop a facility for
females).
o  No violent offenders.

Boot Camp:

Since 1983 when Georgia opened the first boot
camp, the Georgia Department of Corrections has
expanded its boot camp program to reach its 1994
capacity of 1,693 in 9 facilities2. All of the
inmate boot camps are co-located with prisons. 

Georgia distinguishes between two types of boot
camps -- probation boot camps designed for young
felony offenders with drug or alcohol problems,
and inmate boot camps designed for nonviolent
prison inmates with sentences of 10 years or less.
Six of the existing facilities are inmate boot
camps, and three are probation boot camps.

Participants in the inmate boot camp program are
identified by the Board of Pardons and Paroles
during the diagnostic process. Judges sentence
young men directly to the probation boot camps.

2 Georgia's comprehensive correctional program has
three components: Inmate Boot Camp, Probation Boot
Camp, and Probation Detention Centers. The Inmate
Detention Centers were not included because they
do not utilize physical training and do little
drill.

The 120-day program employs a military model.
Inmates follow a highly structured routine that
includes extensive heavy labor and physical
training. They are trained in military drill and
ceremony, and strict adherence to military dress
and courtesy is enforced.

Substance abuse counseling, adult basic education
(ABE) and GED preparation, and other support
services are provided 2 to 3 hours per day.

Eighty-seven percent of inmate program
participants and 91 percent of probation program
participants graduate. Forty percent of inmate
program failures stemmed from disciplinary
problems, and 48 percent of probation program
failures stemmed from medical reasons.

Authority for Aftercare Decisions:

The State Board of Probation and Parole
concurrently approves referral to the program and
parole eligibility on completion of boot camp. The
boot camp commander determines when a graduate has
completed the program, typically about 120 days.
At this point, release on parole is automatic if
there is an acceptable parole residence. If not,
the graduate moves to a corrections facility until
he can locate an acceptable residence or until the
parole board can place him in a transitional
center. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Inmate boot camp graduates are remanded to parole
custody under the responsibility of the State
Board of Pardons and Paroles, as are other inmates
in Department of Corrections facilities. There are
no special boot camp caseloads or supervision
requirements. 

Supervision:

Previously a probation boot camp graduate was
released routinely to intensive probation
supervision if it was available in the graduate's
county. Intensive supervision involves nearly
daily contact with the surveillance officer,
submission to random drug testing, and 96 hours of
community service. Probationers are expected to
either be employed or be full-time students.
Intensive caseloads are designed to be about 25
per officer, but they are generally somewhat
higher. Currently, boot camp graduates are
released to standard caseloads. Standard caseloads
average 200 probationers per officer and have
fewer contact requirements.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

A prerelease coordinator on the boot camp staff
conducts a needs assessment for each individual
and recommends, as appropriate, that special
services or requirements be included as terms of
the parole. This information is relayed to the
assigned parole or probation officer through
telephone calls as well as a written report.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The only special aftercare provision for boot camp
graduates is automatic referral to a substance
abuse counselor, if one is available on the staff
to which they were assigned.

Evidence of Program Effects:

No data were available on the prison return rates
for the 120-day boot camps. The Department of
Corrections reports that boot camps cost less to
construct, with construction costs estimated to be
a tenth of those of prisons. Boot camp operating
costs are also less: $26 per inmate day compared
with $48 in a prison. Finally, because boot camp
beds are turned over three or four times a year,
they can serve larger numbers of offenders at the
lower daily rate, thereby resulting in overall
savings for the system.

Idaho: North Idaho Correctional Institution "Boot
Camp"

Jurisdiction: State of Idaho 

Program Goals:

o  Redirect youth and unsophisticated criminal
offenders away from "hard-core" prison inmates and
long-term incarceration in prison.
o  Conduct fair and impartial evaluations of
inmate behavior to determine suitability for
release into the community.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders adjudicated as adults (youngest
14 and oldest 82).
o  Offenders with sentences of 1 year to life.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No murderers.

Boot Camp:

The North Idaho Correctional Institution (NICI) is
the Idaho Department of Corrections' (DOC's) boot
camp designed as a diversion program for
unsophisticated (substance-involved) offenders. Of
the institution's 250-plus beds, 210 are allocated
for minimum-security boot camp enrollees. The
remainder are accommodated in a small prerelease
work program. NICI employs 64.75 staff, with an
annual operating budget of approximately $2.18
million from the general operating fund and
$180,000 from work project receipts.

Offenders are committed to DOC for a maximum of 6
months, with the sentencing judge retaining
jurisdiction over the offender. Following the
evaluation at boot camp, the offender is released
on probation or incarcerated to serve the
remainder of his sentence. 

Through an integrated model that employs
educational opportunities, group interaction, goal
setting, meaningful work, and a boot camp regimen,
the program attempts to improve offenders' sense
of responsibility, work ethic, knowledge, and
interpersonal skills. About half of the day is
spent on education and counseling and 20 percent
on military drill, discipline, and physical labor.

Since the boot camp began in 1989, more than 600
offenders have entered annually. This equates to
more than 52 percent of the total incarcerated
population each year in Idaho. Approximately 80
percent of those who enter boot camp complete it
to be released on probation.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

As part of the evaluation process at boot camp,
staff prepare a report recommending that the
offender either be released on probation or
incarcerated at another institution to serve out
the remainder of his original sentence. This
report is sent to the sentencing judge, the
probation officer, the prosecutor, and the defense
attorney. In about 90 percent of the cases, judges
follow the recommendations of the boot camp in the
final disposition. 
 
Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

No separate aftercare program or caseload
structure for boot camp graduates is available.
Former boot camp enrollees recommended for release
are placed on probation like others released from
the Department of Corrections facilities.

Supervision:

Supervision levels are the same for boot camp
graduates and other probationers. Many are
initially placed on intensive supervision that
requires contact twice a day, with a maximum
caseload size of 25. Others are placed on a
specialized probation caseload. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

For those inmates completing the residential
substance abuse program component, boot camp staff
contact aftercare staff to make recommendations
for additional treatment. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

Probation officers are responsible for referring
offenders in their caseload to community treatment
services as needed. Boot camp graduates have
priority on receiving substance abuse aftercare
services.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The boot camp reports that recidivism rates for
graduates released to probation are about 19
percent. The average recidivism rate for inmates
on parole in Idaho is 43 percent.

Illinois: Impact Incarceration Program (IIP)

Jurisdiction: State of Illinois

Program Goals:

o  Promote public safety by employing risk
management strategies to select participants and
by gradually reintegrating them into the
community.
o  Promote lawful behavior by developing
responsibility and self-esteem.
o  Address the underlying issues that often lead
to criminal behavior and substance abuse.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Felony offenders between the ages of 17 and 35
who volunteer for the program.
o  Offenders serving first- or second-time adult
prison sentences of up to 8 years.
o  No Class X felony, murder, armed violence,
aggravated kidnaping, criminal sexual assault,
aggravated sexual abuse or subsequent conviction
for criminal sexual abuse, forcible detention, or
arson.
o  No physical or mental limitations or
disabilities that would prevent participation.
o  No history of absconding or escape. 

Boot Camp:

The Illinois Impact Incarceration Program (IIP) is
a prison alternative operated by the Department of
Corrections (DOC) since 1990. IIP operates at
three locations -- the Dixon Springs facility in
the Shawnee National Forest, the Greene County
facility in central Illinois, and the DuQuoin
facility in southern Illinois. The total IIP
capacity is 620 males and 24 females. 

Sentencing judges recommend candidates for the
program, specifically targeting drug and property
offenders. DOC makes the final selection after
conducting physical and mental screening of
recommended candidates. More than two-thirds of
participants are from Cook County. Participants
join platoons for 120 days, extendable to 180
days. 

The program offers a highly structured, quasi-
military environment that includes military
bearing, drills, physical training, and hard
labor. In addition, IIP provides the following
services: a multileveled treatment approach to
substance abuse; an integrated educational program
including both basic education and GED
preparation; a life skills curriculum that covers
employment skills, managing money, and using
public services; and prerelease preparation. The
latter function includes the development of
individual development plans.

The program reports that 87 percent of those who
take the GED test pass. The majority of the
participants complete the program, with 21 percent
of them dropping out voluntarily and 9 percent
terminated for disciplinary reasons. Dropouts
spent an average of 22 days in IIP. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp participants are committed to DOC. If
they successfully complete the boot camp, the
program staff will release them to aftercare.  

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Aftercare is the responsibility of DOC's Community
Services Division, with supervision provided by
officers in the community service centers
distributed across the State. For the first 3
months releasees are monitored by Special
Intensive Supervision Units.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are placed on intensive parole
supervision for a minimum of the first 3 months
after release and are monitored electronically.
They are then transferred to regular parole
supervision for 1 or 2 years, depending on their
original sentence. Initially, the graduates were
placed on intensive supervision without electronic
monitoring for another 3 months, but this
requirement was removed in 1992 because of the low
recidivism rates of program participants.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

An officer from the Community Services Division is
located at boot camp to coordinate release
strategies with the supervising agents. While at
IIP, participants are introduced to the services
available to them in the community -- such as the
Department of Children and Family Services,
Correctional Employment Services, or Title XX. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

There are no organized activities specifically for
boot camp graduates during aftercare. Individual
parole officers are responsible for locating
appropriate services. Graduates in need of
substance abuse treatment are referred to four
community drug intervention programs located
across the State. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

Among the first 199 graduates of the program, 21
percent returned to prison for new felony offenses
for 2 years, compared with 34 percent among a
comparison group. However, the return rate for
technical violations was considerably higher in
the IIP group than in the comparison group. 

The program estimates that IIP has saved the State
nearly $8 million by accelerating the release of
boot camp graduates from prison.

Kansas: Labette Correctional Conservation Camp
(LCCC)

Jurisdiction:  State of Kansas

Program Goals:

o  Serve as a sentencing alternative for youthful
felony offenders before the Kansas Judiciary.
o  Provide a positive life experience that will
increase self-esteem, self-respect, respect for
others, responsibility, accountability, and a work
ethic.
o  Develop coping skills.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Adult male felony offenders between the ages of
16 and 27.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  Physically and mentally able to participate in
the program.
o  No offenders with more than five felony
convictions, a prior conviction in an adult penal
institution, or a record of violent crimes.

Boot Camp:

The minimum-security Labette Correctional
Conservation Camp (LCCC) opened in March 1991. The
camp is county-owned and operated under contract
with the State of Kansas and is privately managed
by Correction Partners Inc. Camp capacity is 104,
but the daily population is typically between 60
and 70. 

Inmates enter the 180-day program in platoons
every 3 weeks. Kansas courts nominate offenders
for the program and provide presentence
investigations and medical information to the camp
screening staff. Approximately 78 percent of those
nominated are accepted into the facility.

LCCC is a highly structured and disciplined
program that stresses accountability and
consequences of actions. In addition to
paramilitary and physical training, the program
offers approximately 3 hours per day in
rehabilitative and educational programs,
including: GED preparation, literacy tutoring,
life-skills training, substance abuse programs,
and counseling. Inmates progress through four
levels: orientation, challenge activities, work
programs--both camp and community improvement
projects--and reintegration. Individuals who do
not progress by mid-program may be discharged
after review by an administrative review board.

The graduation rate for the 619 offenders who
entered the program during the first 3.5 years was
59 percent. About 27 percent of the participants
were discharged for disciplinary reasons, and 7
percent were discharged for medical reasons.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The 1994 Kansas Legislature passed a law requiring
all offenders who successfully complete LCCC to be
supervised by a community corrections program on
intensive supervised probation for 180 days.
Further assignment to community corrections and
assignments for unsuccessful LCCC discharges are
made according to the court's discretion or
sentencing guidelines, as appropriate.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Supervision of an LCCC graduate is the
responsibility of 1 of the 30 different community
corrections programs serving the 105 counties in
Kansas. 

Supervision:

LCCC graduates receive the highest level of
intensive supervised probation available. Although
caseload levels vary from agency to agency, the
Kansas Department of Corrections Standards specify
maximum caseload sizes of 25.

Aftercare Program Activities:

LCCC graduates receive the standard activities
available for other offenders on intensive
probation.

Evidence of Program Effects:

An informal study in 1993 indicates that about 20
percent of the LCCC graduates were subsequently
incarcerated in Department of Corrections
facilities, mostly for technical revocations.

Kentucky: First Incarceration Shock Treatment
(F.I.S.T.) Program

Jurisdiction:  State of Kentucky

Program Goals:

o  Reduce the demand for bed space in the
Department of Corrections.
o  Provide more effective services to inmates to
prevent future crime and incarceration.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female volunteers between the ages of
17 and 29.
o  Inmates with 6 months and no more than 10 years
remaining in a sentence to State Department of
Corrections (DOC), or between 4 and 24 months
remaining to parole board hearing.
o  Medical/psychological clearance required.
o  Target offenders with drug and alcohol
offenses.
o  No one who reads below 6th grade level.
o  No violent felons, sex offenders, those with
prior terms in a State institution, or history of
escape.

Boot Camp:

The 50-bed boot camp opened in 1993 on the grounds
of the Roederer Correctional Complex in LaGrange,
Kentucky. Inmates are screened and assessed for
entry to boot camp at the DOC intake and
assessment center, also located at Roederer. 

Inmates are admitted in 25-person platoons: 20 men
and 5 women. The program begins with an "intake
procedure" designed to break down inmates' pride
in lawbreaking behavior and to examine the
consequences of their previous attitudes and
behaviors regarding self and others. The balance
of the 126-day program is designed to build up the
morale and physical condition of the inmates and
to provide them with support, counseling, and
training.

The program is conducted in a structured and
regimented environment. It includes strict
military discipline, drill and ceremony, military
courtesy, uniforms, and inspections. Inmates are
required to participate in daily physical training
and work details on the correctional complex
grounds.

A strong emphasis is placed on academic education.
Classes are held 15 hours per week (and study hall
2.5 hours per week) for the first 3 months of the
program (the GED test is given at the end of the
third month). Those without a high school diploma
are given GED preparation coursework. Those with a
high school diploma or more receive adult basic
education in their weaker academic areas and serve
as tutors in their stronger areas. During the
fourth month of the program this time is used for
an employability skills program.

Inmates are also required to participate in a
substance abuse program. Classes are held 2.5
hours each weekday. Inmates attend four Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings and two Narcotics Anonymous
meetings per month. The classes involve drug
education, group counseling, and individual
counseling, as well as reading and writing
assignments. 

Approximately 90 percent of the inmates entering
boot camp graduate. Inmates have improved their
math and reading skills by an average of two grade
levels, and 75 percent of those taking the GED
exam have passed it.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

State of Kentucky Parole Board 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Boot camp graduates are released to the
supervision of the Division of Probation and
Parole. All boot camp graduates in a metropolitan
area are assigned to the same parole officer, and
all must attend a substance abuse program.
Otherwise, parole is no different for boot camp
graduates than it is for other parolees. 

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are assigned to intensive
supervision, if it is available in the area to
which they are returning for the first 4 months
after release. Under intensive supervision,
graduates must be employed, frequently contact a
parole officer, be subject to home and work visits
by a parole officer and random drug tests, and
attend meetings of a substance abuse prevention
program. They are then placed in regular
supervision for the balance of their sentences. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Modest efforts have been made to integrate
aftercare programming with that in boot camp. The
majority of parole officers have visited the boot
camp and learned about its objectives and type of
programming. Those from counties near the boot
camp may visit the inmates while they are still in
camp. Similarly, the boot camp staff assist in
preparing the prerelease report and occasionally
attend parole activities.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Graduates returning to the Louisville area may go
to a halfway house for men who need continued
substance abuse treatment or who are unable to
find suitable living arrangements. The halfway
house conducts an intensive treatment program,
keeping men within the facility for the first
month, and then letting them out for limited job
search or employment purposes. The facility is
shared with a "halfway-back" program for nonboot
camp parolees, who have committed technical
violations of the terms of their parole, and
graduates from a substance abuse program at the
Roederer Correctional Complex. There is another
halfway house for women who cannot find suitable
living arrangements. It does not have a substance
abuse treatment emphasis.

Boot camp graduates in Louisville also meet
monthly to share experiences and provide mutual
support.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Ten percent of boot camp graduates have been
reincarcerated, all on technical violations,
compared with 37 percent of the members of a
comparison group, some of whom committed new
crimes.

Louisiana: Intensive Motivational Program of
Alternative Correctional Treatment (IMPACT)

Jurisdiction:  State of Louisiana

Program Goals:

o  Provide an alternative to long-term
incarceration for primarily youthful first- and
second-time offenders.
o  Reduce costs without undue risk to public
safety.
o  Develop participants' self-discipline, self-
confidence, self-respect, individual
responsibility, and respect for others.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female volunteers under the age of 40
serving sentences in State prison.
o  First felony offenders committed to State
custody for 7 years or less for an offense with
parole eligibility. 
o  Second-time felony offenders who have not
previously spent time in State prison and who have
been committed to State custody for 7 years or
less for an offense carrying parole eligibility.
o  No offenders with outstanding felony charges,
numerous outstanding misdemeanor charges,
outstanding immigration detainer, mental or
physical health problems, history of assaultive
behavior or escape, overt homosexuality, sex
offense against a child or any violent sexual
offense, or absence of postrelease residence plan.

Boot Camp:

In 1987 the Department of Public Safety and
Corrections began operating a 136-bed military-
style boot camp program at the medium-security
Hunt Correctional Center. Up to 20 female slots
are available at the Louisiana Correctional
Institute for Women; these inmates would be bused
to the boot camp daily. The 90- to 180-day program
uses a three-phased approach to promote its
philosophy of discipline and treatment. Regular
program activities include military drill and
ceremony training, physical training, and
organized recreational activities. Treatment
programs include a re-educative therapy class that
requires participants to evaluate their beliefs
and values, substance abuse education classes and
activities, and prerelease (life skills)
preparation.

The program applies alternative training, such as
extra duty or incentive physical training, for
minor disciplinary infractions. More serious
infractions may result in reduction in rank,
additional duties, or, in some cases, dismissal
from the program. About 55 percent of participants
graduate from the program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

All IMPACT participants are eligible for parole
consideration after serving between 90 and 180
days of their sentences. The parole board uses a
preparole report detailing the participant's
performance while in prison and a report from the
Division of Probation and Parole to determine
whether to grant parole. The decision to grant
parole to boot camp graduates is based on the same
criteria used to grant parole to the general
prison population.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Louisiana Division of Probation and Parole
operates the State's parole supervision. Boot camp
graduates are initially placed under intensive
parole supervision. They are mixed with nonboot
camp parolees, although boot camp graduates
represent a high percentage of the intensive
caseloads at some locations.

Supervision:

On release, all IMPACT parolees are assigned to 3
months of intensive parole supervision where, in
addition to the regular conditions mandated for
all parolees (maintain employment or full-time
educational training), they must satisfy the
following requirements: a minimum of four face-to-
face contacts with a supervision officer each
week, adherence to a curfew, 100 hours of unpaid
community service work, and random drug and
alcohol screenings. After 3 months, supervision
standards are gradually relaxed. Depending on
individual performance, at the conclusion of 6
months of intensive supervision, parolees can be
recommended for either additional intensive
supervision or regular parole supervision.
(Regular parole requires one or two contacts per
month.) 

Aftercare Program Activities:

No additional program activities are provided to
IMPACT parolees, although efforts are underway to
enhance aftercare services.

Evidence of Program Effects:

According to the Multisite Evaluation of Shock
Incarceration report to the National Institute of
Justice, Louisiana is one of three States with
lower recidivism rates than comparison groups in
that failures are more often for technical
violations of parole than for new crime
violations. It is estimated that each 100 inmates
completing the program result in a cost savings of
$750,000 to the State.

o  Classified as minimum-security or prerelease
status.

o  No offenders convicted of violent or sex
crimes, or with recent disciplinary problems.

Part III inmates:
o  Technical parole violators and parole board
recommends the boot camp.

o  Have 9 months remaining to serve on sentence.

Boot Camp:

The Maryland Department of Public Safety and
Correctional Services opened the 256-bed Herman L.
Toulson Boot Camp at its Jessup, Maryland, cluster
of correctional facilities in 1990. The 6-month
program is divided into three phases. The first
phase emphasizes physical training, military drill
and ceremony, and strict discipline. In the second
phase participants are detailed to work in the
community, and in the third phase the emphasis
shifts to prerelease planning and job-readiness
training. New platoons enter the program each
month.

Inmates are screened on entry to the Division of
Correction, and those meeting the eligibility
criteria are transferred to staging at the boot
camp. If the inmate meets the medical,
psychological, and criminal criteria, he or she is
offered a "Mutual Agreement Contract." This is a
legally binding contract between the Division of
Correction, Maryland Parole Commission, and the
inmate. It defines the conditions the inmate must
meet to graduate from the boot camp and
establishes the date the inmate will be paroled if
he or she does so.  

The Toulson boot camp is described as an
"experimental rehabilitation program" that
attempts to remove resentment of authority and
pride in criminal behavior. The program relies on
tight structure, physical training, and military
drills to build self-discipline, self-esteem, and
the ability to work with others. It also uses the
Network approach, a program of community meetings
developed at the New York boot camp program.
Network sessions focus on developing a sense of
community among the inmates, developing effective
communication, decisionmaking, self-awareness, and
other skills. 

The program includes addiction education and
treatment, vocational education, and adult basic
education. Inmates have access to a computerized
education laboratory, allowing each to work at his
or her own pace. Special assistance is available
for inmates with learning disabilities or other
special education needs. The overall graduation
rate from the boot camp program is 72.5 percent,
with women inmates graduating at a lower rate than
the men. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The Mutual Agreement Contract signed before entry
to boot camp defines the conditions the inmate
must meet before release and establishes a parole
date if the conditions are met. The boot camp
staff determines whether the conditions have been
met. Since Part II inmates must complete at least
a fourth of their sentences before being paroled,
they may be transferred to a prerelease unit or a
home detention unit before release.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Boot camp graduates are released to the
supervision of the Department of Probation and
Parole. In Baltimore and Prince Georges counties,
the department operates separate boot camp
aftercare programs with parole officers assigned
exclusively to boot camp parolees. In the
remaining  counties, boot camp graduates move into
regular parole.

The Maryland Department of Economic and Employment
Development has assigned two staff members to work
full time with the Baltimore aftercare program and
has assigned lead responsibility for working with
boot camp graduates to specific staff members in
each county in the rest of the State.

Supervision:

All boot camp parolees are assigned to intensive
supervision after release. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

To facilitate the transition to aftercare, two
parole officers from the Baltimore program are
assigned to the boot camp to work with inmates in
the last 2 months before graduation. In addition,
the parole agents assigned to each of the inmates
visit boot camp before graduation and meet their
charges. Some programs overlap from boot camp to
aftercare. The final 5 months of a 9-month
addiction treatment program at boot camp are
completed during aftercare.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Graduates paroled to the Baltimore area are
mandated to participate in the Boot Camp Aftercare
Parole Program. The program involves the
following: intensive parole supervision;
participation in the "PREP" program (Pre-Release
Employment Program) to find employment or to
enroll in job training or education; participation
in a mentoring program with adult volunteers from
the community; weekly attendance at a substance
abuse training and counseling program; weekly
aftercare support group meetings with parole
officers and adult volunteers; participation in
clean-up activities in the surrounding community;
and referral to other services as needed.

Outside of the Baltimore area, there are no
special boot camp aftercare programs. However,
boot camp graduates are expected to contact the
parole officer more often than other parolees.
Also, a staff member of the State employment
office is available to help in job location and
job readiness training. A statewide committee is
studying ways to make support services for boot
camp graduates more widely available throughout
the State. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

Since the first platoon graduated in the spring of
1991, 19.6 percent of the graduates have returned
to prison. About 25 percent of those returning to
prison committed new crimes. The remainder
returned for technical violations of their parole.
Participants in the Baltimore aftercare program
have a lower recidivism rate of 13 percent, and
they are reported more likely to be employed or
enrolled in school full time.

Of the 1,208 program graduates, 215 earned their
GED while in the boot camp, and 15 went on to
enroll at a local community college.

Massachusetts: Boot Camp

Jurisdiction: Commonwealth of Massachusetts

Program Goals:

o  Provide an alternative to long-term
incarceration.
o  Reduce prison overcrowding while enhancing
public safety.
o  Reduce recidivism and drug use.
o  Increase individual offenders' positive social
values, respect for authority, confidence, and
responsibility.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male/female volunteers under the age of 40
committed to "a house of correction."
o  Eligible for release after serving no more than
18 months of sentence.
o  No convictions for sex offenses, multiple DUI
convictions, domestic abuse convictions,
outstanding felony warrants, motor vehicle
homicide convictions, assaultive crimes plus three
prior incarcerations, lengthy criminal histories,
mandatory sentences, or escape history.
o  No medical or psychological problems.

Boot Camp:

The Massachusetts Boot Camp is a 256-bed, minimum-
security, co-ed facility that emphasizes a
military-disciplined operation within a
rehabilitative, therapeutic community. The
Department of Corrections opened the facility for
male offenders in August 1992 and admitted its
first platoon of females in May 1993.

The 4-month boot camp program attempts to instill
self-discipline, accountability, respect for
authority, and attention to detail, while teaching
offenders basic skills in academic subjects,
substance abuse recovery, and wellness. The
program strives to achieve a workable balance
among militaristic activities and labor-intensive
work assignments, a strict daily regimen of
physical training, and intensive
educational/therapeutic programming. 

The boot camp employs "Get Real," a commercially
produced program that consists of community
meetings, confrontation groups, a clearing
process, three-part meetings, steps in
decisionmaking, and addiction workshops. The "Get
Real" program requires the offender's investment
in his/her own rehabilitative process.
Educational, life skills, and religious services
are also provided on a weekly basis.

The program has admitted 1,151 offenders between
the ages of 17 and 40. Forty-eight percent
successfully completed the program. Of those who
dropped out of the program, 34 percent withdrew
voluntarily, 34 percent were dismissed as
disciplinary problems, 28 percent left for medical
reasons, and 4 percent were terminated on legal
issues.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The Massachusetts Parole Board makes decisions
about parole release on the basis of written
recommendations by the Commissioner of Correction
and the Administrator of the Boot Camp. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

There is no special aftercare program for boot
camp parolees. Parolees are generally placed on
intensive parole in their counties.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are placed on intensive parole
for 4 months and transferred to maximum
supervision after that. If warranted, the parole
can be extended beyond 4 months. Special
conditions include: mandatory urine testing,
mandatory attendance at five Alcoholics Anonymous/
Narcotics Anonymous meetings per week, curfew from
10 p.m. to 6 a.m., and employment or training
program. Electronic monitoring may be used as an
intermediate sanction if necessary and approved.
An intensive parole officer's caseload is
typically 15, compared with 63 on standard parole.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The Massachusetts Parole Board has some
preliminary data on the effects of the program.
However, the board believes that a proper
assessment cannot be made until the program has
been in place for 2 years.

Michigan: Special Alternative Incarceration (SAI)
Program

Jurisdiction: State of Michigan

Program Goals:

o  Reduce prison crowding.
o  Reduce costs.
o  Promote public safety.
o  Rehabilitate probationers/prisoners.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females. 

Probationers eligible if:
o  under the age of 25 when sentenced.
o  never served prison sentence.
o  physically and mentally able to participate.
o  volunteer for the program.
o  never charged with arson or sex crimes, and no
   pending felony charges.

o  never in program before.
o  physically and mentally able to participate.
o  serving first prison sentence.
o  minimum sentence is no more than 36 months.
o  never charged with violent or sex crimes,
   arson, escapes, or no pending felony charges.

Boot Camp:

In March 1988, Camp Sauble was established as
Michigan's first Special Alternative Incarceration
(SAI) program serving 120 male offenders. In June
1991 the Cassidy Lake Technical School, a minimum-
security prison camp, was converted into the new
Michigan Department of Corrections Special
Alternative Incarceration Program, serving male
prisoners and female probationers and prisoners.
The Cassidy Lake facility provides slots for 336
males and 24 females. 

The 90-day boot camp employs military-style drill
and discipline in an effort to break down the
inmates' accustomed behaviors, defenses, and
attitudes so that new beliefs and behaviors can be
instilled by the program. The program emphasizes
the development of personal responsibility, work
ethic, self-esteem and self-discipline.

Participants spend 6 hours per day on work
assignments within the boot camp facility or in
the community. They spend 1.5 hours per day in
physical training. Military drills are
interspersed throughout the day.

The inmates participate in counseling and skills
training for more than 2 hours each evening. The
programs include life skills, stress management,
substance abuse awareness, GED preparation and
adult basic education (ABE), job-seeking skills,
and general counseling. Each inmate is given an
academic achievement assessment on entry to the
program, and the results are used for placement in
an educational program while in the boot camp and
after release. The local school district conducts
GED preparation and ABE classes. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The SAI Intensive Aftercare Supervision is divided
into two phases. Phase II, a residential program
placement, is an optional component that lasts no
more than 120 days. The need for Phase II
placement is determined by the supervising field
agent. The 120-day Phase III Intensive Aftercare
Supervision, or intensive community supervision,
is provided by SAI Intensive Supervision teams or
regular field agents depending on the number of
SAI graduates going to an area. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

A residential aftercare center is operated by the
Department of Corrections in Wayne County (serving
about 33 percent of boot camp graduates) and by
the Field Operations Administration for the rest
of the State. The intensive supervision phase is
conducted by the Department of Probation and
Parole.

Supervision:

Phase II supervision consists of residential
program placement during which the SAI graduate is
closely supervised and assisted with various
reintegration issues, such as decompression, case
planning, job search, and placement into needed
rehabilitative programming. In metropolitan areas,
Phase III supervision is provided by SAI intensive
supervision teams. A team consists of a field
agent and a field services assistant and usually
supervises no more than 30 SAI graduates. A total
of 13 counties are served by these teams. In other
counties, intensive supervision is provided by
field agents who also have regular caseloads.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The activities of the residential aftercare
facility are integrated with those of the boot
camp. This occurs in the continuation of
programming in education, substance abuse, job
search skills and in other counseling.

Aftercare Program Activities:

After completing the boot camp, and if the
supervising field agent deems necessary, graduates
spend up to 120 days in a residential facility.
Wayne County, which receives a third of the
graduates, has a facility dedicated to boot camp
graduates. Elsewhere, graduates are sent to an
existing probation residential center. At the
residential facility, inmates are subject to
strict discipline and work details within the
facility and mandatory community service. They
must participate in drug abuse treatment programs,
submit to random drug testing, and conduct a job
search or enroll in educational or vocational
classes. Additional services and counseling are
available if required by the probation or parole
officer or requested by the participant.
Participants are expected to find a "career-path"
job prior to leaving the facility. Those who do
not find a job must enroll in a full-time high
school program or in the vocational training
program. In Wayne County, the residential program
offers vocational training in the culinary arts or
computer training for program graduates.

The graduate's stay in the residential facility
can be extended for disciplinary infractions or
failure to participate in required programs,
particularly those related to securing employment.
The stay may also be extended if the program
graduate needs more time to complete prerelease
planning, secure suitable living arrangements, or
complete more substance abuse treatment. 

Following release from the residential program,
boot camp graduates spend a minimum of 120 days
under intensive supervision. In the metropolitan
counties where the special SAI teams have been
established, this involves up to 26 contacts per
month between a team member and the graduates,
random drug testing, and sometimes electronic
monitoring, especially for those who are not
employed or in school full time. Requirements
include employment of at least 30 hours per week
or enrollment in a vocational or academic program;
submission to drug testing; participation in a
substance abuse counseling program; and
participation in all community rehabilitation
programs ordered either by the Parole Board or the
sentencing court.

After completing intensive probation or parole,
the graduate is assigned to regular supervision
for 14 months or the remainder of the graduate's
minimum sentence, whichever is longer.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Approximately 72 percent of the prisoners and 82
percent of the probationers admitted to the boot
camp complete the program. Of those who do not,
the majority voluntarily quit. Eighteen months
after the 1992 expansion of the program, 90
percent of the prisoners who graduated and 68
percent of the probationers were still on parole.
Ten percent of the prisoners and 32 percent of the
probationers were in prison. About two-thirds of
the probationers in prison had committed technical
violations and one-third had committed new crimes.

Minnesota: Challenge Incarceration Program (CIP)

Jurisdiction: State of Minnesota

Program Goals:

o  Punish and hold offenders accountable.
o  Protect the safety of the public.
o  Treat offenders who are chemically dependent.
o  Prepare the offender for successful
   reintegration into society.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Adult male and female nondangerous drug and
property offenders committed to the Department of
Corrections.

o  Commitment must follow revocation of a stayed
sentence, or the term of imprisonment must be
between 18 and 36 months with no dispositional
departure under State sentencing guidelines.

o  Volunteers for the program.

o  No previous or current conviction for murder,
manslaughter, criminal sexual conduct, kidnaping,
or any offense involving death or intentional
injury.

o  No physical or psychological limitations.

o  No history of program failure or failure while
on supervised release. 

Boot Camp:

The Department of Corrections began operating its
72-bed, 6-month Challenge Incarceration Program
(CIP) at its Willow River/Moose Lake facility in
1992. The program philosophy emphasizes personal
accountability, choice, and commitment to change.
The program structure includes strict discipline,
physical training, work programs, development of
critical-thinking skills, substance abuse
avoidance education, acupuncture for stress and
addiction relief, literacy training, nutrition
education, and life-skills training. 

Inmates are returned to a secure facility for
repeated rule violations or for new offenses.
Currently 78 percent of the participants complete
the residential phase of the program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Ninety days before a participant is expected to
complete the residential program, a CIP aftercare
agent reviews his/her status. Those who have both
successfully completed the residential phase and
have developed an appropriate release plan are
released into intensive community-supervised
release, the first of two aftercare phases. On
completion of the first aftercare phase, with a
CIP agent's recommendation and approval from the
Department of Corrections' Office of Adult
Release, the offender can graduate to the second
aftercare phase, general community-supervised
release, for the remainder of his/her original
sentence.                            

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Department of Corrections operates the first
phase of the aftercare program at a day-reporting
location in Minneapolis. Offenders in the seven-
county area around Minneapolis-St. Paul (70
percent of the boot camp graduates) are required
to report regularly to a day-reporting center.
Three CIP staff supervise caseloads of about 14
aftercare enrollees. In addition, the CIP staff
are responsible for ensuring that offenders in
nonmetropolitan areas are linked with local
programs and resources to meet the phase two
supervision requirements. 

Supervision: 

For the first 6 months after release from boot
camp, offenders are required to maintain daily
contact with their CIP agent, either through
visits to the day-reporting center or through
phone calls. Offenders must submit a weekly
schedule for their agents' approval. They can
expect random and unannounced contacts and phone
calls from their agents to ensure schedule
compliance. Participants must also abide by
curfews.

During the second aftercare phase, offenders are
assigned to a parole agent in their communities.
With the approval of the Office of Adult Release,
the designated parole agent determines the level
of supervision appropriate for each offender. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Before offenders are released from boot camp, boot
camp program staff and CIP aftercare agents hold
integrated planning sessions to ensure that
aftercare programs incorporate the boot camp
philosophy. For example, the chemical dependency
training, acupuncture therapy, and cognitive
training sessions begun in boot camp are continued
in the first phase of aftercare.

Aftercare Program Activities:

During the first aftercare phase, in addition to
maintaining daily contact with CIP staff,
offenders are required to secure and maintain
full-time employment or be involved in full-time
vocational training programming. First-phase
aftercare participants are also required to
participate in the following program components:
group problem-solving meetings; critical-thinking
sessions; chemical dependency counseling; and
random drug and alcohol tests. Offenders may be
required to participate in biweekly acupuncture
sessions, and they are encouraged to stay
physically fit. Individual counseling is provided
on an as-needed basis.

The second phase of aftercare consists exclusively
of supervisory activities.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Of those who graduate, 85 percent successfully
complete the aftercare portion of the program. No
data are yet available on the subsequent
recidivism rates.

Mississippi: Regimented Inmate Discipline (RID)

Jurisdiction: State of Mississippi

Program Goals:

o  Provide an alternative to long-term
incarceration under the mandate of the earned
probation statute.
o  Develop self-discipline, a positive attitude,
and prosocial values.
o  Promote personal responsibility.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Sentencing under the Earned Probation Program
(EPP).
o  Male or female volunteers of any age.
o  No death or life sentence, previous
incarceration for a felony,  previous conviction
for a felony involving use of a deadly weapon, or
conviction for an offense requiring a mandatory
sentence under the Earned Probation Statute.
o  No histories of psychiatric disorders, mental
retardation, extensive juvenile criminal activity,
substantial health problems, or sexual offense. 

Boot Camp:

The Regimented Inmate Discipline Program (RID), a
paramilitary prison rehabilitative program, was
instituted by the Mississippi Department of
Corrections in 1985. The highly structured program
operates at two facilities, one for females with a
capacity 40 and one for males with a capacity of
300. The length of stay is typically between 90
and 120 days.

The program falls under an existing EPP statute
that permits the release of certain offenders on
probation after serving at least 30 days and no
more than 180 days of their sentences at the
Department of Corrections (DOC). Offenders are
screened for earned probation eligibility as they
enter the DOC classification facility, and
eligible offenders are transferred to the RID
program. 

The RID philosophy is to forcibly change an
offender's behavior. By creating external order
and control, RID participants learn to comply with
authority and learn that such compliance generates
success. Paramilitary activities such as marching,
inspection, cleaning, and calisthenics generate
discipline. Other RID program components include:
structured individual and group therapy sessions
to stimulate attitudinal changes; drug and alcohol
counseling and rehabilitation based on the 12
steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and concluding with
each offender preparing a detailed plan for
noncriminal sobriety; daily work and community
service details beginning in the third month; and
adult basic education to improve literacy skills
and assist participants in obtaining a GED.

Beginning in October 1992, a therapeutic
prerelease program was integrated into the RID
program. This program element was designed for all
participants and consists of employability classes
and job-search assistance/development. The
prerelease program attempts to match participants
with employment opportunities and conducts job-
related followups for 90 days after program
release.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Based on the combined assessment of all program
staff, a decision to pass or fail an inmate is
submitted in a report to the inmate's sentencing
judge offering recommendations for the future
disposition of the case. Weighing such factors as
nature of the original crime, previous criminal
history, performance at boot camp, and boot camp
staff recommendations, the court may release the
participant to regular or intensive probation
supervision, to a restitution center, or to
another correctional facility. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

No special aftercare program exists. About 91
percent of the participants graduate from RID.
They are released to the supervision of the
Department of Corrections probation officers. The
caseloads include RID graduates and other
probationers.

Supervision:

The court assigns RID graduates to regular,
intensive, or strict probation. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp staff are available for consultation via
phone.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The RID graduates receive the same services as
other community probationers.

Evidence of Program Effects:

RID reports that participants have less negative
and more positive attitudes and behaviors; short-
term prison costs have been reduced for those who
would have been sent to prison; and there have
been some reductions in overcrowding.

Montana: Swan River Correctional Training Center

Jurisdiction: State of Montana

Program Goals:

o  Provide an alternative to long incarcerations
for selected offenders.
o  Modify the behavior of participants by
employing the shock incarceration training
technique.
o  Develop self-esteem, self-responsibility, self-
discipline, and a solid work ethic.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male volunteers under the age of 35 serving a
sentence of at least 1 year.
o  Classified as medium or minimum custody. 
o  No offenders designated as "dangerous" by the
court; nor those with a history of violent,
predatory behavior; nor escapers; nor those with
outstanding detainers.
o  No one with medical or psychological problems.
o  Sex offenders, provided they can be treated
while at the program.

Boot Camp:

The Department of Corrections and Human Services'
Boot Camp Incarceration Program was established in
July 1993 to provide an alternative to long
incarcerations for selected offenders. During
reception, processing staff screen offenders to
determine eligibility and space availability.
Offenders are then referred back to the court for
sentencing under the Boot Camp Incarceration Act,
or, for parole violators, to the Board of Pardons.
Offenders enter in platoons every 3 weeks. Release
is staggered, occurring after completion of at
least 90 days and before 120 days.

Offenders participating in the 30-bed program
follow a regimented schedule that involves
strenuous physical training; manual labor
assignments; personal development counseling in
chemical dependency, anger management, and
effective habits; paramilitary activities drill
and ceremony; rigid dress and appearance codes;
military courtesy; a GED program; and training for
jobs, parenting, and living skills. 

Minor disciplinary infractions result in the
imposition of alternative training. More serious
infractions result in actions by a review team or
by the disciplinary team for potential
terminations. An offender's stay can be extended
for up to 30 days. Of 160 participants admitted to
the program as of November 15, 1994, 34 are still
in the program and 69 completed the program
successfully, resulting in a graduation rate of 55
percent. The primary reasons for program losses
are voluntary withdrawals and terminations for
medical or disciplinary problems.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

At the conclusion of the boot camp, staff review
the participant's performance, criminal record,
and home environment and recommend to the judge
release to either intensive or regular
supervision. The court makes the final decision. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Immediately after graduation, while the court is
deciding on release status, about 90 percent of
participants are transferred to the Great Falls
Transition Center, a Department of Corrections and
Human Services prerelease center operated under
contract with a not-for-profit agency. Those not
sent to prerelease are placed in intensive
supervision probation and are electronically
monitored. Participants may stay in the prerelease
center for up to 60 days. This may be extended if
recommended by boot camp personnel or court order.
 
One wing in the prerelease center, staffed by a
counselor and three assistants, is designated
specifically for boot camp graduates. After
release from the prerelease center, boot camp
graduates receive the same services and
assignments as other offenders on intensive or
regular supervision.

Supervision:

While residing at the prerelease center,
participants spend 8 hours a day working or in
training programs, and they return to the center
for additional evening programming. The specific
contact and supervision requirements for those on
intensive or regular probation may be set by the
individual probation/parole officers. Intensive
supervision caseloads are typically 15 per agent,
while regular caseloads are 90 per agent.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Attempts have been made to integrate the
programming at the boot camp and prerelease center
through frequent telephone and personal contact
among the staff. The boot camp recently added a
full-time institutional probation and parole
officer, and the prerelease center works closely
with a liaison officer of probation and parole in
Great Falls. The probation/parole phase of the
program is totally independent of the boot camp.
Further integration of boot camp and prerelease
center programming occurs through continued use of
military-style courtesies and deportment codes
established at boot camp.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Prerelease program activities center on readying
the offender for life in the community. The
activities include group and individual counseling
sessions; an outpatient substance abuse treatment
program -- "Getaway Recovery"; job-search
assistance; educational programming; and physical
training. While at the prerelease center,
offenders are expected to continue using the
military courtesies developed at boot camp.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Although no recidivism data are yet available, 20
of the first 38 boot camp graduates successfully
completed the community supervision phase of the
program, and 14 were still under supervision in
the community. Three graduates were sent back to
prison, and one was serving additional months in
the prerelease center for drug violations.

Boot Camp:                     

Since 1991, the Nevada Department of Prisons has
operated a 96-bed boot camp program on the grounds
of the Southern Desert Correctional Center in
Indian Springs, Nevada. Inmates progress through
three phases lasting from 150 to 190 days.

District judges assign inmates to boot camp before
sentencing. Sentencing is held in abeyance until
the inmate either completes the program and is
released on probation, or until he is dismissed
from boot camp.

The rigorous 17-hour daily schedule includes
physical training, including 7 hours of labor,
preparation for the GED, and a drug abuse
prevention curriculum that offers stress
management and social skills development. In
addition, work assignments with the Nevada
Division of Forestry serve as community service.
Before release, inmates participate in special
sessions designed to ease the transition to the
community. As of April 1994, 67.5 percent of the
participants had completed boot camp.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Before a participant completes the program, the
boot camp provides the district attorney and/or
the sentencing judge with a performance report for
the boot camp participant. If the participant's
performance in boot camp was satisfactory and
there is no outstanding warrant or detainer, the
court can issue an order of release to place the
individual on probation. In some cases, the judge
may order a sentence reduction. Those participants
not receiving an order of release are returned to
jail. Approximately 90 percent of boot camp
graduates receive an order of release and are
placed on probation.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Currently, no special aftercare program
specifically for boot camp graduates exists. In
Las Vegas, two probation officers are assigned to
supervise boot camp graduates, but caseloads may
have nonboot camp graduates as well. 

Supervision:

Most boot camp graduates are placed on regular
probation supervision.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Judges may mandate that as a condition of parole,
some graduates obtain additional educational
training (special education or GED studies),
individual counseling, anger management sessions,
and substance abuse programming. Boot camp
graduates also are required to secure employment.
The boot camp program, in conjunction with a
private business, Mirage Corporation, assists
unemployed graduates in finding employment.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The Nevada Department of Prisons reports an 18-
percent recidivism rate for its boot camp
graduates. Ninety-two percent of the trainees who
enter the program obtain their GEDs.

New Hampshire: Shock Incarceration Program

Jurisdiction: State of New Hampshire

Program Goals:

o  Develop self-esteem. 
o  Instill individual accountability.
o  Develop a solid work ethic and a sense of civic
responsibility.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female felony offenders between the
ages of 18 and 30. 
o  No prior history of incarceration in a State or
Federal prison.
o  No conviction for murder, first-degree assault,
aggravated felonious sexual assault, kidnaping,
robbery, escape, subversive activities, sabotage,
or felonious use of a firearm.
o  State residents with no relocation plans.
o  Deemed inappropriate for community sanctions
and likely to receive prison sentence.
o  Volunteer for the program.

Boot Camp:

The Department of Corrections began operating the
120-day shock incarceration program at its Lakes
Region Facility in Laconia in 1990. Staff include
eight drill instructors, two part-time drug and
alcohol counselors, and a probation/parole
officer. The program has a capacity of 72 (60
males and 12 females), with the potential to
expand to 120 if the need arises. The current
daily population averages about 25 to 35, for a
staff-to-offender ratio of 1 to 3.

Offenders, generally those with sentences between
2 and 4 years, enter the program every 2 months in
platoons of about 16. Eligible offenders may be
identified by probation/parole (during the
presentence investigation or during the plea-
bargaining process), by individual judges, or by
prison staff. Screening and final approval of
eligible offenders are the responsibility of the
Department of Corrections. Participation in the
program is voluntary.

The program philosophy is that character can be
developed by systematically challenging the
offender physically and mentally to overcome
adversity and defeat. The rigorous schedule
includes 7 hours of hard labor during each
weekday, more than an hour of physical training,
and 3 hours of adult basic education, substance
abuse avoidance education, or other counseling.
The program is divided into four phases, each of
which addresses a different set of issues: the
crime and awareness of the victim; substance
abuse; personal issues and positive habits; and
responsibilities after release. 

The program applies alternate training such as
extra duty or incentive physical training for
minor disciplinary infractions. More serious or
frequent infractions may result in dismissal from
the program or a 60-day recycle. Eighty-six
percent of the participants complete the boot camp
successfully. Of the 313 offenders to enter the
program as of October 1993, 11 percent were
recycled and 14 percent were dismissed.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp is an alternative to a prison sentence
for most of the participants. The court suspends
the prison sentence under the condition that boot
camp is successfully completed and sentences
offenders to up to 5 years probation. After
release from boot camp, participants serve their
remaining probation sentence. The Department of
Corrections refers some offenders directly to boot
camp. Decisions about release for this group must
be approved by the parole board.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The shock incarceration program conceives of
aftercare as a fifth phase of the program. Three
of the staff at boot camp -- the probation/parole
officer and the two drug and alcohol counselors --
conduct the special Shock Incarceration Aftercare
Program, consisting of required biweekly meetings
for all boot camp graduates. In addition,
participants are directly monitored by
probation/parole officers in the various counties.

Aftercare Program Activities:

After a 3-week adjustment hiatus, each platoon
meets every other week for 6 months, combining
with preceding and subsequent graduating platoons.
These meetings are conducted by the three staff
members from boot camp at a central, usually urban
location. Attendance is required, with
transportation assistance provided by the local
probation/parole officer. Each meeting follows a
set format, beginning with a social hour and
followed by discussions of pressing personal
problems. Participants are encouraged to air their
difficulties and to confront individuals with
negative attitudes. Those with extremely negative
attitudes may be removed from the group, which is
subsequently a violation of probation. 

At these meetings the drug and alcohol counselors
continue the drug education programming begun
during boot camp. In addition, individuals with
substance abuse problems are expected to
participate in local Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous groups.

Supervision:

Supervision levels vary among individuals and
across counties and are the responsibility of the
local probation/parole officer to which the
individuals are assigned. Upon release from boot
camp, most offenders are placed on intensive
supervision for 90 days. This level of supervision
may require up to daily contact. Caseload sizes
range between 12 and 25 individuals per officer.
If there are no problems during intensive
supervision, an individual is placed on standard
supervision, requiring one or two contacts weekly.
Standard caseload sizes are typically about 100
per officer.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Biweekly platoon meetings are expressly designed
to build on the social bonds and programming begun
at boot camp. The meetings follow the same pattern
as in boot camp and are conducted by the same
staff.

Program Effects:

As of October 1993, 61 of the 249 graduates from
the program had been returned on a violation of
probation, and another five had violations
pending, for a 24-percent recidivism rate. The
program reports that a University of New Hampshire
study of the program found that the "shock" 2-year
recidivism rate was only 17 percent, compared with
47 percent for the men's prison.

New York: Shock Incarceration Program

Jurisdiction: State of New York

Program Goals:

o  Reduce the demand for bed space in the
Department of Correctional Services.
o  Treat and release selected State prisoners
earlier than court-mandated minimum sentences
without compromising community safety.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females sentenced to various prison
terms.
o  Those between the ages 16 and 35 at time of
commission of crime.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  Those eligible for release within 3 years.
o  No violent felonies, A-1 felonies,
manslaughter, sex offenses, or history of escape.
o  No previous sentence of indeterminate prison
terms.

Boot Camp:

Started in 1987, the program, run by the
Department of Correctional Services in four shock
incarceration facilities, has a total capacity of
1,390 beds for males and 180 for female, plus 222
beds for the orientation and screening stage.
Participants are identified at reception and
eligible offenders are offered the option of 6
months in a shock incarceration facility (boot
camp) and 6 months on intensive parole. As of
September 1993, 15,500 inmates had been sent to
the program. 

The boot camp employs the therapeutic community
model known as "Network," which was established in
the New York State Department of Correctional
Services in 1979. Network is based on the
principles of control theory and Alcoholics
Anonymous. Participants enter in platoons, live in
the community, participate in peer confrontation
groups and life skills classes, and earn status
and privileges that, in turn, allow them to serve
as positive role models for other youths. The
multi-treatment program emphasizes discipline,
hard labor, education, substance abuse treatment,
counseling, and physical training.

Inmates who may be dismissed may continue in the
program for several weeks of reevaluation during
which their behavior and progress are closely
monitored. Sixty-three percent of the inmates
entering the program graduate. Voluntary
withdrawals and removals for disciplinary reasons
are the most common reasons for not completing the
program. 

Authority for Aftercare Decisions:

Graduates are presented to the parole board, which
has discretion in granting release. About 99
percent of the candidates are subsequently
released on parole. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The New York State Division of Parole operates the
State's shock parole. Since two-thirds of the
shock graduates reside in New York City, a
special, separate aftercare program has been
implemented there. The aftercare program operates
out of the Manhattan division of the parole
office. Staff include a bureau chief, 6 senior
parole officers, and 37 parole officers. The
parole officers work in teams of 2, sharing a
caseload of 38 parolees.

Graduates returning to other locations do not have
access to any special aftercare program, but they
are placed under intensive supervision. Two parole
officers share a caseload of 38 boot camp
parolees, half the regular caseload. The program
is currently attempting to standardize the
aftershock programming on a statewide basis. 
 
In New York City the Division of Parole contracts
with the Vera Institute of Justice for parolee
participation in the Neighborhood Work Project
(NWP) and the Vocational Development Program
(VDP). It also contracts with the Fellowship
Center for Relapse Prevention Counseling and with
the Episcopal Mission Society for operating the
Community Network Program. 

Supervision:

Parolees participate in the intensive aftercare
monitoring program for 6 months and complete the
remainder of their sentences under traditional
parole supervision. Shock program goals include:
securing a job within a week of release; enrolling
in an academic or vocational program within 2
weeks of release; participating in mandatory
substance abuse counseling; and attending a
community network program. Monitoring includes
random urinalysis checks, curfew checks,
employment and other verifications, and home
visits. 
 
Each two-person team is assigned to a specific
neighborhood and is expected to conduct home
visits and checks together. The parole officers'
responsibilities include attendance at the evening
sessions held 4 nights a week. The average
caseload size is 19 per officer in the aftershock
phase and 38 per officer in the later phase under
traditional supervision.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The two components of the shock program, the
incarceration program and the New York City
aftershock program, employ the same philosophy of
a "network" therapeutic community. In aftershock,
much of the programming begun while the parolee
was incarcerated, such as the use of peer
confrontation and support groups, continues. In
addition, parole staff are located at each of the
shock facilities to prepare prerelease residence
and employment plans.   

Aftercare Program Activities:

Parole officer teams are responsible for casework
and intervention efforts on behalf of the shock
incarceration parolees. Available services
include:

o  Temporary housing and support services for up
to 90 days for individuals in need of a stable
residential placement.

o  Immediate transitional training for up to 75
days through Vera Institute's Neighborhood Work
Project. This program provides shock graduates who
are not employed when they are released with work
4 days a week. A daily stipend provides the shock
graduate with immediate earnings. 

o  Job placement, employment counseling, and
vocational testing services through the vocational
development program also operated by the Vera
Institute of Justice. The program consists of an
orientation class, a 4-day life-skills training
class to address topics such as job interviews and
resume writing, and an intake class where each
graduate is assigned to a personal job developer.
The personal job developer assists the graduate in
finding jobs. During 6-months in 1993, 576 shock
parolees enrolled in the program. Of those
enrolled 304 were placed in jobs and 76 were
placed in on-the-job training. 

o  Relapse prevention counseling through the
Fellowship Center. Within 2 weeks of release all
New York City shock parolees are referred to the
center for an individual assessment. Parolees are
required to attend weekly meetings organized by
the platoon to discuss factors that may lead to
relapse and common problems they have experienced
in readjusting to the community. Parolees
identified as being at risk of relapse are
counseled individually as well. In 1993 these
services were provided to an average of 248
graduates each month.

o  Weekly network sessions conducted by the
Episcopal Mission Society to build on the Network
program initiated during the boot camp. The weekly
sessions follow a set format. They begin with a
community meeting that focuses on individual and
group responsibility. A four-part meeting designed
to develop self-esteem and to focus on specific
issues follows. The session concludes with a
"cleaning" meeting to allow participants to vent
feelings and ideas. Participation is required for
the first 3 months after release. During 6 months
in 1993, the Society held 107 group meetings and
an average of 235 graduates received services each
month. 

Program Effects:

Compared with inmates from minimum- or medium-
security facilities, shock inmates were younger
and were more often committed for drug crimes.
While at boot camp, shock inmates were involved in
more incidents that were categorized as serious
than were inmates in the medium- and minimum-
security facilities. The shock group was less
often involved in incidents of a less serious
nature than the comparison inmates. During the
first 6 months of shock, 61.5 percent of the
graduates increased math scores on the TABE by one
grade or more, and 45.1 percent increased their
reading scores by one grade or more. Rates of
testing inmates for the GED and rates of earning
the GED are considerably higher at shock
facilities than at medium-security facilities. 

Shock graduates perform better on parole than the
comparison groups. They have higher employment and
higher enrollment in community programs at the 6-
month mark than comparison graduates. After a
year, 90 percent of the shock group were still in
the community, and at 24 months 70 percent were
still in the community. The lower success rates of
three comparison groups were statistically
significant.

The department estimates that for every 100 shock
inmates released, $2.05 million is saved for the
care and custody of the inmates. Thus, for the
8,842 inmates released by September 1993, the
department estimates a savings of $176.2 million.
Savings from avoidance of capital construction
were estimated to be another $129.1 million.
Savings resulting from the fact that the shock
graduates return less frequently to custody than
do the non-shock graduates are estimated to be an
additional $8.3 million.

North Carolina: Intensive Motivational Program of
Alternative Correctional Treatment (IMPACT)

Jurisdiction: State of North Carolina

Program Goals:

o  Free prison beds by reducing incarceration for
selected offenders.
o  Improve participants' self-confidence,
discipline, and work ethic.
o  Develop positive and responsible behavior among
participants.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male volunteers between the ages of 16 and 25.
o  Nonviolent offenders serving a prison sentence
of a year or more.
o  No offenders with a previous incarceration of
more than 120 days.

Boot Camp:

Started in October 1989, IMPACT is a 90- to 120-
day boot camp program operated by the North
Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC). It
currently admits platoons of up to 30 inmates
every 2 weeks, up to a total capacity of 180. The
program employs 70 staff with an estimated cost of
$48 per inmate per day.

The court sentences participants directly to the
program. The daily regimen includes exercises,
drills, work, and school with more than 7 hours
devoted to work and 2.5 hours earmarked for study
each night. In addition, over the course of the
90-day program, participants receive between 16
and 18 hours of substance abuse counseling and are
involved in a ropes challenge course. 

As of August 1994, the program has served about
1,963 offenders. Fifteen percent of the
participants had not completed boot camp for
medical or disciplinary problems. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp graduates are released to probation,
either intensive or regular, according to the
order of the sentencing court. Discussions are
currently underway for greater program input into
aftercare decisionmaking. 

Aftercare Agency and Staffing:

Boot camp graduates report to their assigned
probation officers within 24 hours of release from
the program. The Division of Adult Probation and
Parole of DOC provides probation supervision to
boot camp graduates. There are no special staff or
probation requirements for boot camp graduates.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates may be on regular or intensive
probation supervision. No percentages were
available.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effect:

The program reports a 25-percent recidivism rate,
about half of which is for new crimes and half for
technical violations.

Ohio: Shock Incarceration Program Camp Reams

Jurisdiction: State of Ohio 

Program Goals:

o  Divert nonviolent offenders from lengthy
sentences in conventional prisons.
o  Free up prison beds for more violent, serious
offenders.
o  Improve offenders' behavior, values, and goals
and thereby increase their ability to become
productive citizens.
o  Increase offender's self-discipline, self-
esteem, sense of responsibility, and work ethic.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males between the ages of 18 and 30 sentenced
to the Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction. 
o  Convicted of a third- or fourth-degree felony.
o  Volunteers for program.
o  Those with a remaining sentence between 5 and
60 months. 
o  Good physical and mental condition.
o  No offenders of violent or sex crimes, offenses
involving firearms, or history of escape.
o  No offenders with a prior incarceration in a
State institution or detainees.

Boot Camp:

The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
(DRC) opened Camp Reams, a 108-bed minimum-
security boot camp on the grounds of the
Southeastern Correctional Institution in 1991. DRC
screens and assesses offenders at its reception
center, admitting them as space becomes available.
Participants must complete 90 days of active
participation in the boot camp before transferring
to a transitional program. 

The 90-day boot camp program attempts to produce
behavioral conformity through advanced military-
style training that involves drill, hard labor,
and physical training. In addition, each evening
the program offers adult basic education (ABE)
classes including preparation for the GED, a 12-
step substance abuse program, counseling sessions,
and life-skills classes that include values
clarification, decisionmaking, employment skills
development, and effective parenting. 

No provisions for repeating the Shock
Incarceration Program are available. Except for
sick-day allowances, offenders who are not able to
complete the program in 90 days are returned to
DRC to serve the remainder of their sentences.
Participants can also be removed for disciplinary
infractions or a failure to adjust. About 53
percent of the first 1,664 offenders who entered
the program graduated. Twelve percent of the
dropouts had entered the program without knowing
the outcome of a motion filed for shock probation,
and they were removed to enter the probation
program. Twenty-seven percent quit voluntarily and
8 percent were terminated.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Aftercare consists of two phases: 30 to 60 days of
intermediate transitional detention; and intensive
parole for up to 6 months, followed by maximum
parole for the remainder of the inmate's sentence.
The authority for the release to intermediate
transitional detention resides with the director
of the Shock Incarceration Program. The authority
for release to intensive parole resides with the
Department of Adult Parole.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

DRC contracts with a nonprofit agency to operate
Alvis House, the halfway house that serves
graduates of the shock incarceration program.
After release from Alvis House, the adult parole
authority is responsible for the shock
incarceration graduates. The parole authority does
not make special provisions for shock graduates
except to ensure that they are placed on intensive
supervision for up to 6 months. 

Supervision:

During intermediate transitional detention, each
participant is under the supervision of a parole
officer. Program participants are confined to the
intermediate transitional detention facility
except when participating in another approved
program. 

During intensive parole, the inmate must: check in
with the parole officer at least once a week;
submit to random urine checks; be employed or
actively looking for employment; and continue to
participate in a substance abuse counseling
program. Intensive caseload sizes are typically 11
per officer, compared with standard parole
caseload sizes of 75 to 80 per officer.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp staff participate in the development of
the treatment program for each inmate. In
addition, the transitional program continues some
of the military courtesies developed in boot camp,
such as requesting to speak and standing at
attention when staff enter the room. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

During intermediate transitional detention, each
participant participates in a comprehensive set of
services including:

o  Substance abuse programming -- including
individual counseling, group education, and drug
testing.

o  Life-skills programming -- including parenting,
personal finances, health, and self-esteem.

o  Employment-services programming -- including
assessment, counseling, training, and job
placement.

o  Other programming, including supervision by
center staff, case management, and referral
services.

After 30 days in the intermediate transitional
detention facility, participants who meet the
following conditions will be released to intensive
parole: completion of all programming required as
a condition of his release from the boot camp;
development of a parole plan; demonstrated
capability to continue substance abuse treatment;
employment or vocational training; and
identification of suitable living arrangements.
Those who do not meet these conditions after 60
days are returned to a correctional institution.

On intensive parole, the participants continue
participation in a drug abuse treatment program
and are referred to job placement, vocational
training, and other support services as necessary.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The staff have yet to compile data on the
program's effectiveness.

Oklahoma: Regimented Inmate Discipline (RID)
Program

Jurisdiction: State of Oklahoma

Program Goals:

o  Serve as an alternative to standard
imprisonment for first-time incarcerates.
o  Reduce prison overcrowding and cut costs by
providing a shortened prison term.
o  Deter trainees from future crime by providing
insight into the controlled lifestyle of prison.
o  Improve trainees' self-control, self-esteem,
ability to respond to authority, and capability to
redirect their lives.
o  Provide a foundation on which trainees can
develop the competencies to meet daily challenges.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female offenders who are 25 years old
or younger.
o  Offenders with sentences of 5 years or less.

Boot Camp:

The minimum-security William S. Key Correctional
Center is host to the Oklahoma Department of
Corrections' (DOC's) Regimented Inmate Discipline
(RID) Program for males. The RID program for
females is located at the Dr. Eddie Warrior
Correction Center. The programs can accommodate
150 males and 120 females.3

Most inmates enter the program by court order with
a delayed incarceration sentence. The Department
of Corrections also assigns inmates to RID from
those who meet the eligibility criteria and are
classified as minimum or community security risks.
In either case inmates spend between 10 and 15
days at the Lexington Assessment and Reception
Center before transfer to the boot camp.

The program lasts 120 days, but time spent in jail
or at the reception center is credited towards
that requirement. Typically, an inmate spends
between 90 and 100 days at the boot camp.

The central program feature is regimented
discipline. This includes acceptance of authority,
competency in physical training and drill and
ceremony, consistency in personal grooming and
space maintenance, compliance with rules and
regulations, cooperativeness with the program
structure, and a positive attitude, motivation,
and leadership. 

The program also emphasizes education and
vocational training, allotting between 3 and 6
hours a day for GED preparation or, for
those with a GED or high school diploma, a
vocational training course. All trainees complete
a vocational assessment course that permits them
to experiment with a variety of trades. Those who
participate in a vocational training course are
eligible to enter the Department of Vocational and
Technical Education's programs on release. 

About 66 percent of the male trainees graduate. It
has been suggested that female graduation rates
are higher, but data are not yet available.
Trainees may be removed from the program for
disciplinary reasons, failure to participate or to
progress, or mental or physical conditions
preventing full participation. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Decisionmaking for aftercare depends on the
sentence under which the trainee entered the
program. Those trainees who entered the program by
court order with a delayed incarceration sentence
return to the court for sentencing at the
conclusion of RID. Judges typically resentence
graduates to probation and place them under
intensive supervision, but they may also return
them to boot camp to serve more time or send them
to another institution. The Department of
Probation and Parole supervises the RID graduates.


The Department of Corrections makes release
decisions for those trainees it placed in the boot
camp program. 

Supervision:

Trainees who were placed by the Department of
Corrections serve the remainder of their sentences
in a minimum security institution or are released
to a community center, depending on their risk
level. The RID graduates are mixed in with other
DOC wards. 

RID graduates resentenced to probation are
typically placed on intensive supervision.
Intensive probation officers generally have a
caseload of 100 offenders. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

RID graduates have access to the same programs and
services as other probationers or community
custody inmates, but they are not provided any
additional services. However, RID graduates who do
not have a GED or equivalent must receive remedial
education during aftercare.

Evidence of Program Effects:

A study conducted by MacKenzie and Souryal (1994)
indicates that slightly more than 11 percent of
the RID graduates either received a new criminal
charge or revocation within 24 months of release.

Warrior Correctional Center for females. The
capacity at OSP is 170.

The shock incarceration program provides a highly
structured, disciplined, and monitored program of
activities and work for a minimum of 45 days.
Inmates are not permitted outside contacts, access
to radio and television, tobacco use, or personal
possessions. Psychological and chemical abuse
evaluation and educational and vocational
assessment are used to develop comprehensive
community supervision plans.

From September 1991 through March 1994, a total of
2,228 inmates have exited the program. Forty of
these did not complete the program, a failure rate
of 1.8 percent. Of these, four died and one
escaped.

Oregon: Success Using Motivation, Morale,
Intensity, and Treatment (SUMMIT) Program

Jurisdiction: State of Oregon

Program Goals:

o  Promote offender rehabilitation through
cognitive restructuring training, alcohol and drug
treatment, life-skills training, basic education,
and instilling personal discipline.
o  Reduce recidivism.
o  Reduce prison overcrowding through early
release of graduates.
o  Reduce need for additional prison beds.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females between the ages of 18 and 40
and those under 18 convicted after remand from a
juvenile court.
o  Physically and mentally able to complete the
program.
o  Sentenced to the custody of the Oregon
Department of Corrections under sentencing
guidelines statutes.
o  Between 8 and 36 months left to serve in
sentence.
o  Assigned to minimum custody status.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders with enumerated violent crimes and
enumerated sex offenses.
o  No offenders with a recent history of escape,
an Immigration and Naturalization Service
detainer, or requiring protective custody.

Boot Camp:

Oregon opened its 6-month Success Using
Motivation, Morale, Intensity, and Treatment
(SUMMIT) Program at the Department of Corrections'
(DOC's) Shutter Creek Correctional Institution in
North Bend in March 1994. The SUMMIT capacity is
200 males and 16 females. Offenders are screened
on intake to the Department of Corrections and
enter in platoons. 

The program is modeled after the New York Shock
Incarceration Program. It is highly structured,
intense, and regimented. Offenders spend about 10
percent of their time on military drills and
physical training and about 14 percent on hard
labor in the boot camp and the community.

In addition to the military emphasis, the program
employs a therapeutic community model. Each
platoon of boot camp participants holds daily
community meetings to develop a sense of
membership and to help each individual view his
actions from the perspective of the community.
More than one-half of the daily schedule is
devoted to a comprehensive living-skills
curriculum. The curriculum includes: cognitive
training to alter each inmate's thinking to
prosocial adaptation; alcohol and drug treatment;
employment and job-seeking skills; money
management; community reintegration skills;
literacy and education; anger and stress
management; personal health; and spiritual
wellness.

The Department of Corrections may remove offenders
from the program for administrative or
disciplinary reasons and transfer them to another
DOC facility, subject to consultation with a
superintendent's review committee, and, in
disciplinary cases, a disciplinary hearing.
Offenders subject to removal may also be recycled
or restored to complete the program with a later
platoon.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

DOC has the authority to release graduates to
community supervision. Inmates successfully
completing the institutional phase of the program
enter a 1-month transitional phase where they are
supervised in the community. Inmates who meet all
requirements of this transitional leave will be
released to postprison supervision. Offenders are
released from DOC after completing their terms of
postprison supervision, which range between 6
months and 3 years. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

DOC's Division of Community Services supervises
offenders in the community. Each county has
designated a parole officer to be the contact
person for release planning.

Supervision:

Participants maintain inmate status for 30 days
after release into the community. Since boot camp
graduates have had their sentences reduced, they
are held to a higher standard of performance in
the postinstitutional phase. However, supervision
levels vary according to the graduates' county of
origin. Where available, inmates are released to
intensive supervision. When appropriate, graduates
will be placed in transitional housing upon
release.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The designated parole officer from each county
works with boot camp staff to identify the needs
of individual inmates and develop a release plan.
The county parole officers meet or teleconference
with the inmates and institution staff before
release to develop the release plan, initiate
applications for services, and other planning for
a transition to the community.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The inmates are assigned to the highest level of
parole supervision available in their home county,
requiring frequent contact with their parole
officer. All require participation in Alcoholic
Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous or other substance
abuse treatment, employment or participation in
job-search assistance, and counseling sessions.
Some counties give boot camp graduates needing
mental health, substance abuse, or other treatment
priority for available services.

Evidence of Program Effects:

No data are available on program effects since the
program only opened in March 1994.

Pennsylvania: Quehanna Boot Camp Program

Jurisdiction: State of Pennsylvania 

Program Goals:

o  Provide a safe, secure, and humane alternative
to standard incarceration.
o  Provide the opportunities and mental framework
for positive change.
o  Facilitate the adoption of an alcohol- and
drug-free lifestyle.
o  Improve control of emotions and behavior.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females under the age of 35.
o  Sentenced to the Department of Corrections for
2 to 5 years.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders convicted of homicide, kidnaping,
rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse,
felony robbery, and history of escape.
o  No one with psychological, physical, and
medical problems.
o  No one with prior violent offenses or
detainers.

Boot Camp:

The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections
established the Quehanna Boot Camp in Clearfield
County in 1992 as a 6-month alternative to a
traditional State incarceration sentence. The
capacity of the minimum security facility is 200
(190 males and 10 females), which accommodates
monthly platoons of about 20. Although open to
both males and females, only one of the first 108
graduates was female.

The referral and screening process begins when a
judge, after consideration of the sentencing
guideline ranges and legislative requirements,
indicates on the sentencing order that boot camp
should be considered as an option. Eligible
inmates are sent to the Diagnostic and
Classification Center for expedited
classification. Inmates must then apply to the
Department of Corrections for acceptance into the
program.

The program is designed to balance a military boot
camp approach with the traditional correctional
values and inmate management philosophy of the
Department of Corrections. The program employs a
highly structured, intense environment that
includes military drill and ceremony, uniforms,
military courtesy, and rigorous physical training.

More than 4 hours each day are spent in
educational or counseling groups to promote life
skills and to provide drug- and alcohol-therapy.
The Pennsylvania Probation and Parole Board has
assigned five licensed alcohol and drug treatment
specialists to boot camp. The therapeutic program
includes:

o  Individual and group psychotherapy.
o  Drug and alcohol education and relapse
prevention.
o  Relaxation and stress reduction training.
o  Communication skills development.
o  Spirituality development.
o  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics
Anonymous (NA) meetings.
o  Values clarification and life-skills
development.

Of the first 225 participants to enter the
program, 80 percent graduated.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Release of the inmate from boot camp to parole is
automatic upon successful completion of the 6-
month program. The judge's sentencing order
referring the inmate to boot camp serves as
permission for the inmate to be released prior to
the expiration of the minimum sentence. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Boot camp graduates are automatically released to
intensive supervision by the Pennsylvania
Probation and Parole Department (PPPD). 

Supervision:

On release, each graduate is placed on intensive
probation or parole between 1.5 and 4.5 years
(depending on the terms of the original sentence).
The supervision requirements of intensive parole
include weekly face-to-face meetings and regular
attendance at AA or NA meetings. The requirements
total approximately 24 hours per week of intensive
parole activities. On average, intensive parole
agents maintain caseloads of 10 to 20 parolees.
Adequate performance leads to reduced supervision
in subsequent years.

In addition, those offenders with unacceptable
living arrangements may be placed in a halfway
community corrections center. In the larger cities
electronic monitoring is an option. 

Aftercare Program:

All inmates are assigned to the Treatment
Alternatives to Street Crimes (TASC) program. Boot
camp graduates receive the same services as other
intensive parolees -- substance abuse treatment,
stress- and anger- management education,
vocational training, job-search assistance, and
physical training. 

Evidence of Program Effects:
As of November 1994, 18 of 167 boot camp graduates
have been reincarcerated for a recidivism rate of
10.4 percent.

South Carolina: Shock Incarceration Program

Jurisdiction: State of South Carolina

Program Goals:

o  Reduce prison crowding and cut costs by
providing a shorter term alternative. 
o  Improve self-esteem, self-control, and ability
to cope with challenging and stressful situations
by experiencing strict, but not harsh, discipline.
o  Provide punishment by placing offender in more
severe environment than probation.
o  Provide opportunities for self-discipline, hard
work, education, counseling, and training to
address problems related to criminality.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females sentenced to the Department
of Corrections or to the Shock Incarceration
Program.
o  Those who are between the ages of 17 and 29 at
the time of sentencing.
o  Those eligible for parole in 2 years or less,
or, if not sentenced at screening, subject to
being sentenced to 5 years or more or being
revoked from probation.
o  Physically and mentally able to participate.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders with violent convictions, prior
incarceration in an adult State facility or the
shock incarceration program, or offenders with
major detainers or holds pending.

Boot Camp:

The South Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC)
operates a 192-bed shock incarceration facility
for men at the Wateree River Correctional
Institution and a separate 24-bed facility for
women at the women's correctional center. The
program opened in 1986 and was expanded in 1990.

Originally judges sentenced offenders directly to
the program, but new legislation allows
corrections officials to select offenders after
commitment. Currently, the majority are selected
by the Department of Corrections from offenders
entering the reception centers. Participants must
meet eligibility criteria, volunteer for the
program, and pass the screening for medical or
psychological impairments. Judges may sentence
eligible offenders to 15 days for evaluation in a
DOC screening facility before final sentencing or
make a recommendation on the commitment order for
the shock incarceration program. About 3 percent
of the participants are sentenced directly to the
program after evaluation, and only 17 percent
enter on a commitment recommendation.

The boot camp program lasts for 90 days. The
program may extend this period for inmates who
show unsatisfactory progress or who cannot
identify suitable living arrangements.
Approximately 90 percent of male inmates and 82
percent of female inmates successfully complete
the program. The most common reasons for not
completing the program are disciplinary problems.

The boot camp program emphasizes military drill
and discipline and physical training to develop
teamwork, cooperation, self-control, and self-
esteem. Inmates are engaged in meaningful work
details for 7 hours each day; in addition, they
participate in 3 hours of education and additional
programs on life skills, substance abuse, and
release planning. The substance abuse program is
provided by the South Carolina Commission on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Parole is automatic on successful completion of
the boot camp program. Staff from the Department
of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services conduct a
risk assessment to determine the type of
supervision needed and to confirm the suitability
of living arrangements.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon
Services. There is no special staffing for boot
camp graduates. 

Supervision:

Currently, all boot camp graduates are under
regular supervision in the community. There are no
special requirements for boot camp graduates.

Aftercare Program Activities:

There are no special activities for boot camp
graduates while on parole.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports that 18 percent of female
graduates and 26 percent of male graduates have
been reincarcerated. These rates compare favorably
to the 35 percent of the inmates leaving other
State institutions who return to prison.

The estimate of program savings for 1990 was $2.6
million. Program staff also estimate that the work
performed by the inmates has saved local
governments as much as $60,000 per year.

Tennessee: Special Alternative Incarceration Unit
(Wayne County Boot Camp)

Jurisdiction: State of Tennessee

Program Goals:

o  Evaluate offenders' motivation to adopt a
noncriminal lifestyle.
o  Modify thoughts and behaviors to reducing
recidivism and promote good citizenship.
o  Provide early release to inmates who progress
satisfactorily.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males between the ages of 17 and 35 who have
received maximum sentences of 6 years, or for some
drug offenses 12 years.
o  No sex offenders, violent offenders, or
specific drug offenders. There are some
exceptions.

Boot Camp:

Established in December 1989, the 150-bed minimum-
security boot camp program is run by the Tennessee
Department of Corrections on the site of a
previous medium-security institution. The
multifaceted treatment regimen strives to promote
self-discipline, correct irrational/criminal-
thinking patterns, provide exposure to a work
ethic, encourage behavior change to reduce the use
of drugs and/or alcohol, and develop problem
solving techniques. Each inmate participates in an
educational program, drug/alcohol abuse prevention
program, prerelease program, and a special program
to enhance social, communication, and
decisionmaking skills. The prerelease program is
designed to prepare the inmate for his return to
the community.

Throughout the 90- to 120-day program,
participants' behavior is monitored by drill
instructors, case managers, counselors, and
psychological evaluators. Those individuals
failing to demonstrate satisfactory progress are
either assigned to a motivational platoon,
required to continue in the intensive program, or
transferred to the general prison population. 

Of 1,899 inmates who entered boot camp, 75.9
percent have completed the program. Major reasons
for program failures are refusal to adequately
participate or medical unsuitability for the
program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The Department of Corrections Division of Adult
Institutions.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

There is no aftercare program and no special
probation staff assigned to boot camp graduates. 

Supervision:

On graduation from boot camp, inmates are assigned
to either regular or intensive probation. Officers
for intensive probation maintain caseloads of 50
parolees. A regular probation caseload is 70. The
number of contacts for regular probation is 1 to 2
times per month. Eight monthly contacts are
required for those on intensive probation. Boot
camp graduates are required to perform 8 hours of
community service per month until their sentence
expires or their probation manager waives the
community service work. They must also submit to
random drug screening.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:
No recidivism data are available from the program.

Texas: Special Alternative Incarceration Program
(SAIP)

Jurisdiction: State of Texas 

Program Goals:

o  Assess offenders' needs for additional
incarceration or release on probation.
o  Assist participants in restructuring work
habits and family and peer relationships.
o  Provide participants with a negative impression
of prison life to deter future criminal
activities.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males and females between the ages of 17 and
25. 
o  Probation eligible and sentenced to the
institutional division for no longer than 90 days.
o  No one with physical or mental health
limitations that would preclude strenuous physical
activity.
o  No offenders with prior incarceration in a
penitentiary for a felony conviction.

Boot Camp:

Following authorization by the Texas Legislature,
in 1989 the Department of Corrections began
operating its 75- to 90-day Special Alternative
Incarceration Program (SAIP) for young offenders
who have been sentenced to the institutional
division. The boot camp serving male offenders is
located on the grounds of the T. L. Roach Unit in
Childress County. The program for males has a 500-
bed capacity, about half the capacity of the
facility, but the boot camp currently uses only
300 beds. Twenty boot camp slots for female
offenders are available at a separate facility and
are likewise currently underused. 

Offenders sentenced to SAIP must be eligible for
probation, but they are sentenced to the
institutional division, with the sentencing court
retaining jurisdiction for 90 days. Offenders who
have not been returned to the sentencing court for
release on probation after 90 days are
automatically transferred to the general prison
population.

SAIP is an intensive, military-like program with a
legislative mandate that it include strenuous
physical labor. Other program components include:
basic literacy education; employment counseling;
life-skills training; social training; and a 75-
hour substance abuse counseling and education
program that focuses on stress management,
communication skills, and values clarification.

The vast majority (85 to 90 percent) of the boot
camp enrollees complete the program successfully
and are released on probation. Those who are
removed for noncompliance are assigned to other
institutions to serve the remainder of their
sentences.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

On completion of the program, SAIP submits
individual progress reports to the sentencing
court and recommends whether inmates should be
released on probation. The court seldom departs
from the program staff's recommendations. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

There is no special aftercare program for SAIP
graduates. They receive the same probation
supervision services as the non-SAIP probationers
and are folded into the regular caseloads.

Supervision:

The majority of the SAIP probationers are placed
on regular probation supervision caseloads. 

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:
No recidivism data are yet available.

Virginia: Shock Probation (Boot Camp) Program

Jurisdiction: State of Virginia

Program Goals:

o  Serve as an alternative to long-term
incarceration for young, impressionable,
nonviolent offenders.
o  Stress the consequences of continued violations
of the law.
o  Build self-discipline, confidence, and group
cohesion through close supervision and continuous
evaluations of individual performance.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male, nonviolent felony offenders. 
o  Adult offenders 24 years old or younger
convicted as adults in circuit court. 
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders with a prior incarceration in a
State correctional facility or a sentence of more
than 20 years.
o  No offenders with a prior confinement of more
than 12 months or more than a confinement in a
local correctional facility (unless such
confinement resulted from misdemeanor or traffic
convictions).
o  No offenders convicted of murder, manslaughter,
kidnaping, sexual assault, malicious wounding,
robbery, or attempt to commit any of these crimes.

Boot Camp:

The Division of Field Operations of the Virginia
Department of Corrections (DOC) operates the Shock
Probation Program at the Southampton Intensive
Treatment Center. The program serves as an
alternative to incarceration for young offenders.
The residential program lasts 90 days, followed by
a 1-year probation. The average cost per inmate
day is $99.44. 

After conviction, the court refers eligible
offenders to the probation and parole office and
to the program for additional screening. Based on
their recommendation, the court commits the
offender to the Department of Corrections and
suspends the sentence, provided that the offender
successfully completes boot camp as a special
condition of probation.

The intensive treatment center provides a highly
structured program that simulates basic training
in the military. Military drill and ceremony,
physical training, and a rigorous work schedule
are the core program elements. In addition, the
program offers adult basic education (ABE) and GED
preparation, life-skills education, counseling,
substance abuse education, and vocational
assessment. 

Between April 1991 and October 1993, the program
served 694 offenders, of whom 76.5 percent
graduated. Of those who did not complete the
program, about half were unsuccessful due to
disciplinary problems; about a third due to
medical or psychological problems; and 14 percent
withdrew voluntarily. An evaluation of the program
by the DOC shows some improvements in attitudes
and test scores over the course of the 3-month
stay in the boot camp. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Because boot camp referrals participate in the
program as a special condition of probation, they
are automatically referred to a probation and
parole district office.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Except for the requirement that boot camp
graduates be placed on intensive probation
initially, they do not receive any special
treatment or have any special requirements in
aftercare.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are supervised in the
community for a minimum of 1 year. They are placed
on intensive supervision for the first 3 months.
Intensive caseloads are typically about 24
probationers, with a minimum of once-a-week
contact. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The boot camp staff and probation and parole
officers have little contact with each other. Boot
camp staff prepare a progress report for probation
and parole that summarizes the participants'
achievements and recommends areas for improvement.

Aftercare Program Activities:

No special boot camp aftercare activities exist.
Supervision and assistance are individualized.
Each graduate signs a contract with probation and
parole that identifies areas that need special
attention and highlights needs such as substance
abuse treatment, employment, or vocational
training.

Evidence of Program Effects: 

Twelve-percent return rates to DOC for boot camp
graduates compared favorably to those for a
similar group discharged from jail or prison (20
percent) and to those given mandatory parole (27
percent). However, boot camp participants who did
not complete the program had much higher return
rates: 62 percent for those removed for
disciplinary reasons and 42 percent for those
removed for medical reasons.

o  Provide an alternative to revocation for
probation and parole.
o  Provide productive inmate programs and work. 
o  Produce a success rate equal to, or greater
than, traditional parole.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders between the ages of 18 and 30.
o  Offenders with an alcohol or other drug abuse
problem.
o  Inmates with no physical and/or mental
limitations.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders convicted of crimes against life
or bodily security, sexual assaults, or weapon
offenses.
o  No inmates with severe learning disabilities.
 
Boot Camp:

Operated by the Wisconsin Department of
Corrections (DOC), the Challenge Incarceration
Program (CIP) is a 6-month structured discipline
and treatment program located at the rural St.
Croix Correctional Center. The program admits
inmates in squads of 10 to 12 to a maximum
population of 75 men. 

DOC screens inmates at the reception facility and
transports eligible inmates to the CIP facility to
await the formation of a new squad. The inmates
then progress through three phases, with specific
performance expectations attached to each. Failure
to meet these expectations results in removal from
the program.

The program employs rigid discipline and intensive
instruction in military bearing, courtesy, drills,
and physical training. Inmates work 30 hours per
week and are paid $2 per day. In addition, inmates
participate in individual and group therapy
sessions 25 hours per week. These sessions focus
on areas such as anger management, critical-
thinking errors, rational thinking, and abusive
relationships. An additional 8 hours per week is
devoted to alcohol- and drug- abuse treatment
sessions based on the 12-step approach of
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). 

Inmates spend 15 hours per week in adult basic
education. Those who do not have a GED focus on
preparing for the exam, passage of which is
required to graduate from the program. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The boot camp completion rate has been low -- 40
percent. Sixty percent of those starting the
program ask to be dismissed. These high rates are
attributed in part to the fact that offenders may
serve less time in the prison system than in the
boot camp because overcrowding has forced the
system to release offenders early. Moreover,
prison parolees may not have the added requirement
of intensive parole when they return to the
community. 

Upon completion of boot camp, about 80 percent of
the inmates are released to a halfway house for 3
to 6 months. All releasees continue under the
supervision of the Division of Probation and
Parole and are mainstreamed with other inmates
from nonboot camp institutions. Boot camp staff,
the parole officer assigned, and the inmate
jointly decide whether the graduate requires time
in a halfway house.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Division of Probation and Parole supervises
boot camp graduates in the community, integrating
them into its existing case structure. Boot camp
graduates are required to attend AA and Narcotics
Anonymous (NA) meetings. This is not necessarily a
requirement for nonboot camp parolees on intensive
supervision. 

Supervision:

Supervision levels are determined according to a
statewide classification system. Most boot camp
graduates are under intensive supervision for 6
months after release from the boot camp or a
halfway house. Intensive caseload sizes are about
50 to 60 parolees, who must contact their parole
officers weekly.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

None of the military aspects of the boot camp is
continued at the halfway house or on parole.
However, halfway houses do employ similar
counseling approaches to those used at boot camp.
Because of distance, contact between parole
officers and boot camp staff is generally limited
to the telephone. The case plans developed at boot
camp are relayed to the parole officers when the
inmates are released.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Approximately 80 percent of the boot camp
graduates are assigned to halfway houses for 3 to
6 months as a condition of their parole.
Individual and group counseling sessions focus on
rational thinking, avoiding criminal thinking,
chemical dependency, domestic violence, sexual
abuse, and family counseling. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

Of those who complete the program, approximately
10 percent are returned to prison within the first
3 years.

Wyoming: Honor Conservation Camp

Jurisdiction: State of Wyoming 

Program Goals:

o  Reduce prison overcrowding.
o  Divert young offenders from traditional
prisons. 
o  Rehabilitate young offenders by improving self-
esteem, self-discipline, mental health, and
providing adult role models.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males under the age of 25 who have been
convicted as adults.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No one convicted of capital offenses. 
o  No one with prior incarceration in a State or
Federal adult penal facility.

Boot Camp:

The Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp is a 90-day,
intensive boot camp operated by the Department of
Corrections since 1990. The camp has 30 beds and
served more than 300 inmates from 1990 through
1993. 

Inmates are admitted into the program on the
sentencing court's recommendation and after
determination that the individual meets the
eligibility criteria and has the physical and
mental health necessary to complete the program.
Although it is designed as a 3-month program, an
inmate's participation can be extended to 12
months if the program staff determines that it is
in the inmate's interest to do so. Plans are
underway to extend the program to a minimum
requirement of 120 days.

The program employs a military basic-training
model. The bulk of the day is devoted to military-
like activities -- drill and ceremony, physical
training, and group work details. Inmates dress in
uniforms and must follow specific rules about
attire, arrangement of personal items, and
military courtesy. Summary punishment of the
individual and the group is employed.

In addition, inmates are required to attend
counseling sessions focusing on substance abuse,
decisionmaking skills, and life skills daily for
1.5 hours. GED tutoring sessions are conducted 4
hours per week.

The average age of the first 317 inmates to enter
the program was 20 years. The majority of this
group had been incarcerated for property crimes
and the majority reported substance abuse
problems. Eighty percent of the inmates to enter
the program graduated, with the dropouts primarily
occurring either voluntarily or for disciplinary
problems. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

On graduation, inmates return to their sentencing
court for a hearing for a reduced sentence. At
this juncture inmates either have their sentences
reduced to probation or are sentenced to a work-
release program for 6 months, followed by
probation. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Department of Corrections operates three work-
release centers across the State. Boot camp
graduates are folded into the general population
at these centers, and there are no special
requirements or regimens to follow. Likewise, when
graduates are released on probation to the
Division of Probation and Parole, either from a
work-release center or immediately after
graduation from boot camp, they become part of the
regular caseloads and are not singled out for
special treatment. 

Supervision:

Inmates are on "regular" probation status. Those
in the work-release program must have a pass to go
anywhere except to work.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Probation officers across the State have been
briefed on the structure and goals of the boot
camp program. Informal contact between the boot
camp staff and probation officers serves to
provide some linkage, but there are no formal,
routine provisions for exchange.

Aftercare Program Activities:

No special activities. There is a proposal to
require assignment to a work-release program as
part of a transition to the community.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Approximately 17 percent of boot camp graduates
have subsequently returned to prison, a lower rate
than for the typical ex-offender in Wyoming.

Federal Intensive Confinement Centers Lewisburg
(Pennsylvania) and Bryan (Texas)

Jurisdiction: United States and possessions 

Program Goals:

o  Promote personal development, self-control, and
discipline by placing offenders in a highly
structured environment.
o  Reduce recidivism.   
  
Eligibility Criteria:

o  U.S. citizens, male and female.  
o  Priority to offenders under the age of 36.
o  No prior incarceration or minor prior
incarceration. 
o  Direct court placement of between 12 and 30
months or institutional transfer with maximum
original sentence of 60 months and no more than 24
months prior to projected release.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  Recommended by the sentencing judge.
o  Minimum custody status. 
o  No offenders with medical or mental
restrictions.

Boot Camp:

The Federal Bureau of Prisons operates a 192-bed
intensive confinement center for men at the
Federal Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania,
and a 120-bed facility for women at the Federal
Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas. The men's facility
opened in 1990 and the women's in 1992.

The intensive confinement centers attempt to
strike a balance between a military-style boot
camp with an intensive, highly structured
environment, and the bureau's basic philosophy of
inmate management that employs carefully
prescribed sanctions to manage behavior. The
centers do not employ summary punishment, nor do
they use a confrontational approach. The focus is
on positive staff/inmate interaction and the
development of individualized treatment plans.
Program objectives include the development of
responsible decisionmaking, self-direction,
positive self-image, and readiness for employment.

Program activities include: physical training;
military drill; labor-intensive work assignments;
education courses; drug abuse counseling; life-
skills training; and enhancement of
employability/vocational skills. The intensive
phase continues for 180 days.

Approximately 85 percent of the men and 95 percent
of the women who enter an intensive confinement
center complete the intensive phase of the
program. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Bureau of Prisons--Intensive Confinement Center
Director. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The three phases of aftercare are conducted under
the auspices of a Bureau of Prisons community
corrections center. These residential centers
serve as halfway houses and are located across the
country. Program graduates are sent to locations
closest to their homes. Both graduates of the
intensive confinement ("boot camp") program and
releasees from other Federal prisons are housed at
the community corrections centers. There is no
special staffing for boot camp graduates. 

Supervision:

During the first phase of aftercare, inmates are
housed at the community corrections center, which
serves as a halfway house. Inmates may leave the
facility only for employment or special program
services. During the next phase, the prerelease
component, inmates may receive a pass to visit
family and friends but must return to the center
at night. During home confinement for the
remainder of their sentences, inmates are under
intensive supervision and, in some areas,
electronic surveillance.

Inmates who commit minor violations of the terms
of the current phases of aftercare can be returned
to a phase involving more intensive supervision.
Those committing major violations, such as not
reporting to the corrections staff or failing a
drug test, may be returned to a Federal prison for
the rest of their sentences.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Considerable emphasis is placed on the continuity
of program services and positive interactions
between staff and inmates. Inmates identified
during boot camp as having severe drug problems
are required to participate in a more intensive
treatment program during aftercare.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The three phases of the aftercare program differ
in their degree of structure and the availability
of activities and services. The community
corrections centers contract with local agencies
to provide services in job placement, counseling,
housing, drug treatment, vocational training, and
other services. The centers also work to reconnect
the inmate with his or her family and to provide
counseling, parental training, and other
assistance as needed.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Of the men who had completed the center program,
35 percent were still under supervision in the
community and 49 percent had completed their
sentences. Fifteen percent, or 180 graduates, had
been reincarcerated. Except for eight offenders
who committed new crimes, all of those in prison
returned for technical violations of the community
supervision program. Nine others (1 percent) had
pending charges.

Sixty-five percent of the women graduates were
still under supervision in the community, and 24
percent had completed their sentences. Nine
percent had been reincarcerated, all but one for a
technical violation.

Practical Regimented Rehabilitation for Inmates
Determined to Excel Program (PRIDE) Malpitas,
California

Jurisdiction: County of Santa Clara, California
 
Program Goals:

o  Increase offenders' self-esteem and social
awareness.
o  Improve offenders' behavior.
o  Provide vocational education preparedness.
o  Reduce recidivism rate.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Female offenders classified and housed in a
medium or minimum security area.
o  Free of physical and mental limitations.
o  Agree to abide by program rules and adhere to a
rigid schedule.
o  No offenders convicted of certain serious
charges.
o  Those with prior escape histories, gang
affiliations, sex offenses, and assaults on peace
officers are evaluated case-by-case by the program
manager and classification officer.

Boot Camp:

PRIDE has been operated by the Santa Clara County
Department of Corrections since 1991. The program
occupies 44 beds in a medium- security facility.
Staff include corrections officers and educational
instructors. Four platoons enter the program each
year, and participants normally stay for 11 weeks.
Program participation can be extended to the next
platoon. PRIDE serves female offenders
exclusively. Eighty percent of the participants
have children.

PRIDE is a voluntary, semi-military program
designed to prepare inmates to be socially
responsible and productive citizens. The program
attempts to improve inmates' sense of pride and
self-worth/consciousness and to teach inmates how
to successfully manage their lives through the
provision of seven program activities:

o  Education to attain a GED.
o  Substance abuse focusing on self-esteem,
relationships, victimization, environment, and
women's issues.
o  Benefits and mechanics of health and physical
fitness.
o  Parenting skills. 
o  Group/individual therapy sessions dealing with
domestic violence, incest survival, and anger
management, as well as guidance towards positive
alternatives and conflict resolution.
o  Job skills.
o   Team building and the value of good
communication and work skills.

Two-thirds of participants graduate from the boot
camp. The program also reports improvements in
relationships and increased receptivity of
graduates' families.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp graduates who still have time left to
serve are rehoused in regular minimum- or medium-
security units as appropriate to their
classifications. Inmates are allowed to request
choices of unit assignments, which are then
reviewed and assigned by a facility classification
officer. Graduates also have the option to join a
new platoon of boot camp when it starts. 

Boot camp graduates with no time remaining are
processed for release. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

There is no aftercare program for boot camp
graduates. PRIDE's address and phone number are
provided to the graduates if they want to maintain
contact with the program after release. Program
staff also recommend various live-in programs and
make post-PRIDE support counseling available from
program counselors.

Supervision:
Not applicable.

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports that 30 percent of the PRIDE
participants have returned to confinement,
compared with 80 percent for releasees from the
regular jail population.

The Regimented Inmate Discipline Program (Boot
Camp) Pontiac, Michigan

Jurisdiction: Oakland County, Michigan 

Program Goals:

o  Provide an alternative sentencing option to
judges to alleviate overcrowding at the county
jail.
o  Provide strong military discipline. 
o  Increase offenders' self-motivation, ability to
work in teams, and ability to set realistic goals.
o  Improve inmates' physical condition and self-
image.
o  Stimulate inmates to make positive life

months.
o  Certain straight jail commitments.

Boot Camp:

The Oakland County Sheriff's Office has operated
the 8-week Regimented Inmate Discipline Program
(Boot Camp) since 1990. Participants enter in
platoons of between 20 and 30 trainees every 2
months. 

The program emphasizes strict regimented
discipline, daily fitness training, and work
details. Inmates provide manual labor for
community service projects, leaving the camp in
"work details" under the supervision of Oakland
County Deputies. Community improvement projects
have included emergency and disaster relief, parks
beautification, tree planting, and painting
municipal buildings.

The boot camp offers individual counseling
sessions that focus on improving offenders' self-
images and on developing goal-oriented plans for
the future. Class offerings include:

o  CPR/first aid.
o  Boater safety.
o  AIDS awareness.
o  Employability skills.
o  GED course work.
o  Substance abuse awareness.
o  Stress management.
o  Life skills.
o  Military drill.
o  Personal hygiene.

Seventy percent of participants graduate from the
boot camp. Offenders who do not complete the
program serve the remainder of their sentences in
the county jail. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Graduates with a boot camp/probation sentence are
released to the probation department on completion
of the boot camp program. The probation department
determines the level of supervision.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The probation department supervises most boot camp
graduates in the community, integrating them into
the regular caseload structure. Boot camp
graduates do not receive differential treatment.

Supervision:

The probation department determines whether
intensive or standard probation is appropriate on
a case-by-case basis. Most boot camp graduates are
on standard caseloads.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp staff provide the probation department
with a prerelease plan that defines the
employment, education, residence, substance abuse
counseling, and other service needs in the
community. 

Aftercare Program Activities:
Not applicable.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports a 16-percent recidivism rate
among boot camp participants, well below the
average recidivism rate of other offenders.

Nassau County High Impact Incarceration Program
(HIIP) Albany, New York

Jurisdiction: Nassau County, New York

Program Goals:

o  Divert selected technical parole violators with
substance abuse problems from reincarceration in
prison.
o  Provide substance abusers with the treatment
and tools to remain drug free.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male parole violators with a current substance
abuse problem.
o  No outstanding charges other than a parole
violation.
o  No violent offenders.
o  Volunteers for program participation.
 
Boot Camp:

The Nassau County Correctional Center is one of
seven jails that have established High Impact
Incarceration Programs (HIIPs) with the assistance
of the New York State Division of Parole. HIIPs
are specifically designed for parole violators in
need of substance abuse treatment. The Nassau
County Correctional Center allocated 20 treatment
slots in its 60-day drug and alcohol
rehabilitation treatment program for parole
violators. 

Eligible parole violators who are detained at the
center are screened by parole and correctional
center staff before they are offered the
alternative of participation in HIIP. The Parole
Board adjourns the violation hearings of
participants while they participate in the
program. 

The comprehensive, residential drug program
employs the boot camp model, with discipline,
physical training, and military-style drills. (Not
all HIIPs employ a military model.)

Nassau HIIP was implemented in June 1993 with its
first graduates released from jail in August 1993.
During fiscal year 1993-1994, 48 parole violators
(87 percent) graduated from the HIIP diversion
program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Parolees who successfully complete HIIP have their
delinquency canceled by the Board of Parole and
are restored to parole supervision with a special
condition that mandates participation in a
licensed community treatment program.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing: 

The Nassau County Department of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction provides referrals to community
treatment programs for all HIIP graduates. Parole
officers work with Department staff to monitor the
aftercare plan.

Supervision:

Graduates are returned to intensive parole
supervision, where they remain until the maximum
expiration of their sentences or the board of
parole discharges them from supervision.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The aftercare program attempts to build on the
substance abuse treatment begun in HIIP. Parole
officers work with county staff and treatment
providers to ensure comprehensive continuity of
treatment.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The aftercare agency links HIIP graduates with a
comprehensive system of treatment services,
including Topic House, a long-term residential
facility, and an outpatient unit at the Nassau
County Medical Center. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

No recidivism data are yet available.

Rikers Island High Impact Incarceration Program
(HIIP) Albany, New York

Jurisdiction: New York City

Program Goals:

o  Divert selected technical parole violators with
substance abuse problems from reincarceration in
prison.
o  Provide substance abusers with the treatment
and tools to remain drug free.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male parole violators with a substance abuse
problem.
o  No outstanding charges other than a parole
violation.
o  No violent offenders.
o  Volunteers for program participation.

Boot Camp:

Prompted by the success of New York State's shock
incarceration programs in serving as a short-term,
intensive alternative to longer prison sentences,
in 1991 the New York State Division of Parole
worked with the New York City Department of
Corrections to establish the Rikers Island High
Impact Incarceration Program (HIIP), a diversion
program for parole violators in need of substance
abuse treatment. A total of 159 beds are allocated
for this intensive, 60-day treatment program for
these parole violators. 

Eligible parole violators who are detained at the
jail are screened by both parole and city
Department of Corrections staff before they are
offered the alternative of participation in HIIP.
The parole board adjourns the violation hearings
of the participants while they participate in the
program. 

The comprehensive, residential drug treatment
program employs discipline, physical training,
military-style drills, and work details in concert
with extensive educational, rehabilitative, and
vocational counseling. Instead of participating in
the military-like aspects of the program, the
violators participate in a Self-Taught Empowerment
Program (STEP), a structured substance abuse
program that provides academic and vocational
treatment. During FY 94, 611 parole violators
graduated from the HIIP diversion program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Parolees who successfully complete HIIP have their
delinquency cancelled by the Board of Parole and
are restored to parole supervision with a special
condition that mandates participation in a
licensed community treatment program.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

HIIP staff develop aftercare plans for each
graduate. The New York State Division of Parole
supervises graduates in the community and is
responsible for ensuring participation in the
community treatment services. Although there is no
separate program for HIIP graduates, they are
mandated to continue substance abuse treatment in
the community. 

Supervision:

Upon graduation, violators are returned to
intensive parole supervision. They remain under
supervision until they reach the maximum
expiration of their sentence or are discharged
from supervision by the Board of Parole. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

The agencies responsible for the program, the New
York City Department of Corrections and the
Division of Parole, work together. They share
responsibility for determining eligibility during
selection. There also is some substantive overlap
from HIIP to aftercare because of the requirement
that substance abuse treatment continue during
this time.   

Aftercare Program Activities:

Parolees are referred to community substance abuse
treatment programs and to vocational training
programs.

Evidence of Program Effects:

A 1-year followup of FY 93 graduates shows that 78
percent of the graduates were still under parole
supervision after 1 year.

Brazos County Boot Camp Program
Bryan, Texas

Jurisdiction: Brazos County, Texas

Program Goals:

o  Develop self-esteem.
o  Instill individual accountability.
o  Develop a solid work ethic and a sense of civic
   responsibility.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders between the ages of 17 and 22.
o  First-time nonviolent offenders.
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders convicted of murder or attempted
   murder.

Boot Camp:

Since 1992, the Brazos County Probation Department
in Texas has operated a 90- to 120-day boot camp
program. Sentencing judges determine whether a
convict is placed in the program. The program has
15 beds.

The program philosophy supports character
development by systematically challenging the
offender physically and mentally. The rigorous
schedule includes 7 hours of work activities
during each weekday, more than an hour of physical
training, and 3 hours of adult basic education,
substance abuse avoidance education, or other
counseling. Those offenders without high school
diplomas are offered GED instruction.

The program applies alternate training such as
extra duty or incentive physical training for
minor disciplinary infractions. More serious or
frequent infractions may result in dismissal.

Rule infractions result in a hearing before a
three-member, non-boot camp-related committee.
Those expelled from the program are returned to
State boot camp or placed in jail. Program data
indicate that 75 participants have successfully
graduated, reflecting an 80-85 percent completion
rate.  

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp graduates are returned to their
communities of origin. Sentencing judges and
probation officers determine the level of
aftercare supervision to be provided to program
graduates. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:
No special staff is assigned to boot camp
graduates. 

Supervision:
The majority of boot camp graduates are placed on
regular supervision. 

Aftercare Program Activities:
There are no special activities for boot camp
graduates.

Evidence of Program Effects:
No information is available at this time.

Jurisdiction: Travis County, Texas; open to other
jurisdictions with inter-local agreements as space
is available.

Program Goals:

o  Serve as an alternative to longer term prison
confinement.
o  Encourage physical and mental discipline, self-
awareness, responsibility, respect, maturity, and
employability.
o  Afford young offenders an opportunity to attain
the highest level of personal growth.
o  Encourage young offenders to become productive,
self-sufficient members of the community.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female offenders between the ages of
17 and 26. Offenders between the ages of 15 and 16
sentenced as adults. Offenders between the ages of
27 and 41 are reviewed case-by-case.
o  Mentally and physically sound, on no more than
two psychotropic medications.
o  Sentenced on a felony or misdemeanor charge.
o  Voluntary for those already sentenced to jail
or submitted for parole in absentia screening
(latter group also must have a sentence of 5 years
or less, have a nonviolent offense and prior
criminal history).

Boot Camp:

Operated by the Travis County Sheriff's
Department, CORE is designed to provide a highly
structured environment that encourages physical
and mental discipline, self-awareness,
responsibility, respect, maturity, and
employability. The District Courts and Adult
Probation Departments make the majority of
referrals. County Courts also can refer
misdemeanants to the program. The first group of
offenders entered the program in 1988.
Participants enter the program individually upon
the availability of space. The program currently
has a capacity of 120 males and 10 females. Staff
include 25 drill instructors, 2 sergeants, 2
counselors, and a clerk.       

Boot camp participants progress through six
phases, with promotion to each subsequent phase
dependent on performance. The entire program is
designed to be successfully completed in 180 days.
The first 15 days, Zero Platoon, is an orientation
period where clothing and equipment are issued,
participants tested, and the rules, standards, and
procedures learned. The next three phases,
Platoons 3, 2, and 1, emphasize military-style
discipline, in cooperation with a number of
services:  alcohol and drug treatment including
auricular acupuncture for drug craving; three 12-
step meetings per week; group and individual
counseling and assessment; non-drug counseling and
assessment including referral for psychiatric
treatment; challenge programming; mandatory GED
preparation and testing for those without a high
school diploma; vocational training; participation
in work details; and physical training including
an obstacle course.

Boot Camp/Aftercare Transition:

After a minimum of 105 days in the boot camp
program, there is a 15-day transitional phase in
which participants work in government or nonprofit
agencies without direct supervision of the drill
instructors, but return to boot camp in the
evenings. Completion of this phase earns the
participant the right to enter the work-release
program at the institution or, for those from
outside of the county, in their own communities.
This final phase requires that the participant
follow a regular schedule of work or vocational or
educational programming off-site, while continuing
to live at the boot camp and participate in CORE
activities. Participants pay the boot camp a daily
rent of, at minimum $5, depending on their income
levels. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The authority to release a participant depends on
the avenue by which he or she entered the CORE
program. The program prepares an assessment report
for each graduate. The Parole Board has authority
for release decisions for participants who
volunteered for program participation after they
had already been sentenced to prison. The court
retains the release authority for those who were
assigned presentencing or directly as a standard
jail commitment. The court also makes the final
decision for those who are sentenced to probation,
under the condition that they complete boot camp.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

There is no program nor probation/parole staff
designated specifically for boot camp graduates.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are supervised by county
probation/parole staff who maintain caseloads of
approximately 125 to 130 parolees/probations.
Initially, the majority are on high supervision
levels for approximately 3 months.
Probation/parole officers may relax supervision
levels depending on the graduate's performance. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

County probation/parole officers supervising boot
camp graduates visit the program once every 3
months. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

There are no organized aftercare activities
specifically for boot camp graduates. If
necessary, graduates are referred to community
substance abuse programs by their probation/parole
officers.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Fifty-four percent of about 1,100 participants
completed the residential phase. Of those who
graduated, a little more than 150 failed in the
community phase:  about a third committed new
felonies; a third committed new misdemeanors; and
a third had technical violations.

Of 871 "Condition of Probation" participants
currently under study, there was a 34-percent
overall revocation rate (includes nongraduates).

Harris County Boot Camp Program
Humble, Texas

Jurisdiction: Criminal courts of Harris County,
Texas, and other counties throughout Texas

Program Goals:

o  Promote self-awareness, acceptance of
responsibility, feelings of competency, mastery,
and increased self-esteem.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male and female adult felony and misdemeanor
offenders between the ages of 17 and 25.
o  Physically and mentally capable to withstand
the rigors of military-style discipline.
o  Participants are identified by prior criminal
record/activity or by inability to succeed at a
less structured level of probation supervision.

Boot Camp:

The Harris County boot camp is funded by the
Community Justice Assistance Division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice and is run by the
Community Supervision and Corrections Department
serving the criminal courts of Harris County. The
3- to 4-month long program has a capacity of 336
males and 48 females.

While at boot camp, participants progress through
three phases lasting 30 days each. The first phase
emphasizes substance abuse assessments, academic
assessments, physical training, and drill and
ceremony. In the second phase, in addition to
physical training, ropes training, and drills,
participants are exposed to rehabilitative
programming such as academic and literacy
training, life skills training, substance abuse
treatment, and group therapy sessions. While
third-phase program activities include all of the
program elements from the previous phases, an
emphasis is placed on discharge or release
planning. 

Each month, between 80 and 100 offenders complete
the boot camp. Since the program started in 1991,
90 percent of participants have graduated.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

The sentencing judge may place offenders in an
alternative residential program or release them to
community supervision. For those released to the
community, a determination is made by both the
sentencing judge and the assigned probation
officer regarding the level of aftercare
supervision required for each graduate. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Community Supervision and Corrections
Department coordinates all aspects of the
aftercare program. Probation staff have caseloads
that include both boot camp probationers and
regular probationers. 

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates receive substantially more
intensive supervision and services as compared to
other probationers. During aftercare, boot camp
graduates released to community supervision are
required to contact a reporting center daily for
the first 30-60 days, twice a week for the
following 30-60 days, and once a week for another
30-60 days. Graduates are then moved to Tier 2
supervision, reporting twice a month for a year.
They are then placed on regular probation
(reporting once a month) for the remainder of
their sentences.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Boot camp graduates attend Life Skills II
(advanced life skills) 2 nights a week. They also
attend a boot camp support group once a week. This
group session is to help probationers reintegrate
into society by sharing experiences and supporting
fellow graduates. It is monitored by a licensed
counselor. Boot camp graduates also receive the
same services as the other probationers: Each
offender is required to complete a court-mandated
community-service requirement. All graduates must
secure and maintain employment. Unemployed
graduates are required to perform additional
community services and are assisted in their
efforts to secure a job by the Vocations
Intervention Program of the host agency. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

To date, 79 percent of the graduates are still
under supervision or have completed their
probation term.

Hidalgo County Boot Camp Program
Edinburg, Texas

Jurisdiction: Hidalgo County, Texas

Program Goals:

o  Serve as an alternative to prison.
o  Rehabilitate youth offenders within their
community through professional and family
involvement.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders between the ages of 17 and 25.
o  On probation for felony offenses.
o  Physically able to participate in the program.
o  Able to speak English.
o  No violent offenders.

Boot Camp:

Since 1993, the Hidalgo County Community Services
and Corrections Department in Texas has been
operating a 6-month, 96-bed boot camp program for
male offenders. Approximately 10 percent of
program participants are sentenced directly to
boot camp. The remainder volunteer for program
participation as an alternative to incarceration
in other facilities.

Programmatic elements at the boot camp include
drill and ceremony, physical training, physical
labor, educational training, drug and alcohol
counseling, family/religious support programming,
and a volunteer-sponsor (mentor) program.
Educational programming is emphasized. All
residents are required to demonstrate educational
improvement equalling two grade levels prior to
their departure from the facility. While at boot
camp, every program participant is required to
select a volunteer sponsor/mentor to work with him
during boot camp and aftercare phases. The goal of
the volunteer sponsor/mentor program is to alter
participants' negative attitudes and behaviors.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

On successful completion of boot camp, graduates
are sentenced to regular or intensive probation
caseloads. Based on recommendations made by boot
camp staff, probation agents determine each
graduate's aftercare program requirements. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Hidalgo County Community Services and
Corrections Department coordinates all aspects of
probation supervision.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates are sentenced to either
regular or intensive probation supervision.
Typically, a regular probation caseload ranges
between 150 and 250 probationers per agent.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Twice a month during boot camp, probation officers
visit offenders to prepare and discuss their
probation plans. Before graduating, family members
and mentors join the offenders to discuss the
aftercare plan with the program staff. The mentor
sponsorship continues during aftercare.

Aftercare Program Activities:

During the first month after boot camp, graduates
are required to attend weekly aftercare sessions
conducted at the camp. For the following 60 days,
attendance requirements at aftercare sessions are
reduced to twice a month. Counseling and
vocational training are provided during these
aftercare meetings. After 90 days, graduates
report to their probation agent as required. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

To date, the program reports a completion rate of
73 percent. Of the first 96 participants, 23 have
been eliminated for medical reasons or have
escaped.

Environmental Youth Corps
Mobile, Alabama

Jurisdiction: Mobile County, Alabama

Program Goals:

o  Create juvenile peer groups and family-training
programs that develop law-abiding and productive
behavior.
o  Provide training and experiences that promote
honesty, responsibility, self-worth, and respect
for authority and others.
o  Provide a sanction for offenders that
incorporates restitution.
o  Provide chemical abuse prevention through
testing, assessments, and education.
o  Increase reading skills.
o  Increase awareness of the environment and
appreciation of community service.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Adjudicated males between the ages of 13 and
17.

o  No offenders convicted of murder, manslaughter,
first- and second-degree assault, first- and
second-degree kidnaping, first-degree rape, first-
degree sodomy, first-degree sexual abuse, first-
degree burglary, first- and second-degree assault,
robbery, or shooting into occupied building.

o  No youths with medical problems, drug/alcohol
addiction, psychoses, suicide risk, escape risk,
or IQ below 60.

Boot Camp:

Established in 1992, the Environmental Youth Corps
(EYC) is a 45-bed facility located on the grounds
of the Strickland Youth Center. Youth progress
through three phases designed to last 3 months. 

The program specifically targets youths who have
failed on probation. Candidates are referred to
the program by probation officers during the
presentence investigation stage and sentenced
directly to the program. The program admits up to
13 youths each month.

Military discipline and regimentation are the
focus of the boot camp. The military aspects of
the program are intended to gain the attention of
the youths, ultimately improving self-discipline
and concentration. Then, it is thought that the
youths will be more receptive to the educational
and rehabilitative components of the program.
These include life skills and counseling sessions,
physical training, adventure therapy, and an
intensive individualized educational program. 

The residential phase of boot camp is extended for
those who have disciplinary problems. Currently,
82 percent of those who enter boot camp are
successfully released to aftercare. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Responsibility for release of the youths rests
with boot camp staff. Youths are released on
probation after 3 months unless they are recycled
through the program. Youths may be returned to
boot camp for disciplinary or performance reasons.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Aftercare services are provided by the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Greater Mobile and the Strickland
Youth Center. The former provides programmatic and
supervisory services, while the latter provides
case-management services.

Supervision:

All boot camp youths are required to attend a
weekly evening core aftercare session held at a
designated Boys and Girls Club in Mobile.
Supplemental offsite aftercare events are also
conducted on other week nights and on weekends. 

All boot camp graduates are placed on probation
status with the Mobile Juvenile Court and are
required to regularly report to a probation
officer. School and home visits are conducted by
probation officers. Youths who are required to
make restitution are supervised by a restitution
coordinator from the Strickland Youth Center. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

There are two probation officers assigned to boot
camp who work with the youths during the
residential phase and continue to supervise them
while on probation. Near the end of boot camp, a
committee composed of EYC teachers, drill
instructors, probation officers, the aftercare
coordinator, and parents or guardians develops an
Administrative Transfer Plan (ATP) for each
recruit. The ATP identifies specific requirements
that the individual entering aftercare must
accomplish. The requirements may vary with each
cadet to reflect individual needs.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Program services provided at the weekly core
aftercare session include tutoring, life skills
courses, social skills classes, and basketball and
other sports. Once per month youths are required
to participate in an organized community service
activity. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports a 20-percent recidivism rate
for its first year of operation. An additional 6
percent of youths who enter aftercare are
terminated for failure to comply with program
mandates. The program reports 2 percent of
aftercare participants as missing from the
program.

California Youth Authority Leadership, Esteem,
Ability, and Discipline (LEAD) Program
Sacramento, California

Jurisdiction: State of California

Program Goals:

o  Reduce lengths and costs of incarceration.
o  Reduce recidivism. 

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Juvenile court first commitment or parole
violation.
o  No previous LEAD involvement.
o  Not committed for serious violence (classified
as Youthful Offender Parole Board Hearing Category
5-7).
o  Male volunteers 14 years and older.
o  Medical clearance.
o  Substance abusers, addictive personality
history, or at risk of future substance abuse.
o  Youthful Offender Parole Board (YOPB) approval.
o  No youth eligible for special mental health
programs, undocumented aliens, and youth with
recent violent behavior.

Boot Camp:

The California Youth Authority (CYA) opened its
pilot Leadership, Esteem, Ability, and Discipline
(LEAD) program in September 1992 at the Preston
School of Industry in northern California. It is
an alternative short-term program for youths
committed to CYA. A second institutional site was
opened at the Fred C. Nelles School in southern
California in September 1993. Each institutional
boot camp has 60 beds.

Youths are screened for the program at CYA's
northern or southern reception centers. Parole
violators are prescreened by parole agents,
reviewed by the YOPB, then sent to the reception
centers for final screening. First commitments are
completely screened before review by the YOPB. At
commitment, judges may recommend youths for LEAD,
but they cannot place youths in the program. 

LEAD includes a 4-month institutional phase and a
6-month intensive parole phase. The institutional
phase is based on the army's officer-training
model including officer mentors, leadership
rotation schedules, uniform dress codes, marching,
structured physical training, strict decorum,
confrontational training, and extensively
structured daily activity. It features a 3-month
educational component with a practical life skills
focus, a substance abuse prevention component that
employs a 12-step model, and public service
activities in the final month, along with
preparole planning. 

Youths enter the program monthly in platoons of
15. The daily population consists of approximately
50 or more youths. In exceptional circumstances,
youths may be retained in the institutional phase
for an additional 30 days. Program failures are
transferred to regular, longer term institutional
programs based on each youth's previously
established parole consideration date. At the end
of the first year, the dropout rate was 29
percent.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

After release from the boot camp program,
participants serve their remaining commitments on
parole. For LEAD institutional graduates, the
first 6 months of parole involve the LEAD
intensive parole program. The CYA determines when
youths are referred to parole and when they are
recommended for discharge, but final approval for
these decisions rests with the YOPB.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The CYA has assigned two full-time parole agent
positions to the LEAD liaison agent positions in
the northern and southern parts of the State.
Liaison agents are responsible for negotiating a
smooth transition from institutional to parole
phases. In other respects, regular parole agents
staff the intensive parole program. 

Supervision:

LEAD aftercare requires parole agent caseload
ratios of 15 to 1. However, these ratios are often
managed with a 3.5 credit for LEAD parolees who
are added to regular agent caseloads of 52.
Guidelines for parole services (such as number of
contacts and drug tests) are determined by
geographical location of the parolee's home.
Youths residing in urban or suburban locations are
to maintain two parole contacts per week for the
first 60 days and one per week for the following 4
months. Youths living in rural locations are to
maintain one contact per week for the first 60
days and two contacts per month during the
remaining 4 months. Youths in remote locations
need to meet their parole agents twice per month
during the first 60 days and once per month
thereafter. 

Whenever possible, LEAD aftercare uses a relapse-
management strategy to respond to any parolees in
danger of failing parole, including short-term
institutional placement, if necessary. Following
the 6-month intensive parole phase, parolees may
be continued on regular parole supervision.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

To continue the LEAD treatment after boot camp,
informally designated liaison agents were assigned
to be communications links among parolees,
institutional staff, and field parole staff to
smooth and enhance delivery services. For example,
liaison agents sometimes locate and arrange
placements for youths before release to parole.
The position is typically filled on a half-time
basis, with the other half used to supervise LEAD
parolees in the community. Liaison agents begin
working with cadets early in the residential
program phase. They initiate contact with each
cadet's assigned field agent, maintain regular
office hours at the institutional site, and work
with counselors and youths to develop detailed,
realistic parole plans (called Life Plans) for
each youth. 

Aftercare Program Activities: 

Fundamental LEAD services include:

o  Drug treatment, using the "Twelve-Step" or
Relapse Prevention Model, as needed.

o  Employment assistance or vocational training,
using services of the State's Employment
Development Department.

o  Educational assistance, such as placement in
regular public school, vocational training,
tutoring, or day-reporting parole office schools.

o  Family and/or individual counseling as needed.

o  Drug testing.

o  Out-of-home placements, including group home
placement in one of two, six-bed LEAD group homes.

o  Electronic monitoring, residential drug
treatment, or temporary detention (including
short-term restructuring at the boot camp sites)
as strategies for relapse management. 

Evidence of Program Effects:

An implementation and process evaluation of the
first year of LEAD found: a steady intake of 30
youths per month (with 15 randomly placed in the
program and 15 in a control group); safer,
healthier living conditions in the boot camp,
which had a 71-percent completion rate; more
intensive services on parole; and closer working
relations among institutional staff and between
institutional and parole staff. The evaluation
report recommended expanding the aftercare program
to include more job and placement options. An
extensive evaluation of the program employing an
experimental design is in process, but no
recidivism or other data are available as yet.

Rebound/Camp Falcon Juvenile Facility
Golden, Colorado

Jurisdiction: State of Colorado

Program Goals:

o  Develop discipline through teamwork and
physical exercise.
o  Develop a strong work ethic and positive work
habits.
o  Promote individual responsibility.
o  Increase academic achievement and prevocational
skills.
o  Promote a drug-free lifestyle.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Adjudicated nonviolent male offenders between
the ages of 12 and 18.
o  Psychologically stable, able to handle a
confrontational milieu.
o  Physically able to participate in an intensive
physical training regimen.

Boot Camp:

Camp Falcon is a 60-day boot camp operated by
Rebound, a nonprofit corporation specializing in
treatment programs for nonviolent juvenile
offenders. The program was created in a special
session of the Colorado legislature; it opened in
1994 on the grounds of the Lookout Mountain Youth
Services Center in Golden, Colorado. When the
program reaches capacity, it will serve 80 youths
with 32 staff members.

The program is designed for first-time offenders
who would otherwise be sentenced to 45 days in
detention, probation, or the Division of Youth
Services. Judges commit youths directly to
regimented youth training dependent on
satisfactory physical and mental assessments at
the Division of Youth Services regional detention
centers. Youths enter in platoons of 13 or 14.

Camp Falcon emphasizes individual responsibility
in a structured, intensive environment that
incorporates the elements of military basic
training. Other program activities include
education and prevocational programming, drug and
alcohol education, life skills curriculum,
personal hygiene and healthy lifestyles, and a
work program.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

On completion of the 60-day boot camp program,
youths are released to their counties' judicial
departments for 6 to 12 months of probation
supervision.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Participants are monitored by the probation
department in their counties of residence.
Although the legislature provided the probation
departments with additional funding for aftercare
programming, it did not set any standardized
probation requirements for boot camp graduates. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

Probation services could include electronic
monitoring, educational and vocational programs,
short-term residential programs, outreach and
tracking services, and family counseling. It is
unknown what level of services boot camp graduates
currently receive.

Supervision:

Most youths are released on regular probation
caseloads, which range between 40 and 80 youths
and require only a few contacts per month.
  
Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:
Structurally, there is a Boot Camp Advisory
Committee, composed of the chief probation
officers and the boot camp administrators, that
meets monthly to work on common issues. In
addition, a number of probation officers attend
monthly staffing meetings held at boot camp for
each youth.

Program Effects:
No data are yet available.

Leon County Juvenile Boot Camp
Tallahassee, Florida

Jurisdiction: Leon County, Florida

Program Goals:

o  Support and promote public safety.
o  Reduce recidivism among program participants.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male offenders between the ages 14 and 18, who
have been convicted of felony offenses.

o  No sexual offenders.

o  No offenders with psychological or physical
limitations that would preclude program
participation.

Boot Camp:

Since January 1994, the Leon County Sheriff's
Office has operated a 30-bed residential boot
camp. The 120-day program employs an educational
and therapeutic model designed to reduce and
control offenders' anger. The program requires
some military courtesies but does not require
uniforms or military drills. Educational
programming is strongly emphasized during boot
camp, with as many as 8 hours per day being
devoted to literacy training. Other program
components include physical training, anger
management, group counseling, and life skills
training. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Youths committed to boot camp by the Department of
Juvenile Justice are simultaneously sent to both
transitional and aftercare services. The
Department of Juvenile Justice continues to
supervise youths through the transition and
aftercare periods. Boot camp graduates enter a 45-
to 60-day, secure, residential transition program
before release to aftercare. Aftercare
noncompliance can result in a "tune up," or return
to boot camp, for as little as 2 or 3 days, or for
extended periods. 

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The first graduates of the boot camp entered
aftercare in May 1994. The Department of Juvenile
Justice has contracted with Gator Human Service,
Inc., for the provision of community aftercare
services for boot camp youths. Six full-time staff
members are currently assigned to the community
aftercare program.

Supervision:

On graduation from boot camp, youths are placed
for 45 to 60 days at a Department of Juvenile
Justice-sponsored secure residential transition
program that is located at, but separate from, the
boot camp. 

Youths released from the transition program are
required to attend the contractor-operated
aftercare program. The 120-day aftercare program
provides a nonresidential setting where youths
receive daily supervision from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Additionally, youths in aftercare are placed on
electronic monitoring for 45 to 90 days and are
subject to regular home checks. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp, transition program, and aftercare staff
members regularly attend joint planning and
staffing sessions to discuss program components
and the progress being made by individual youth.
Both boot camp and transition program staff
receive more than 400 hours of job preparation
training.

Aftercare Program Activities:

The Department of Juvenile Justice's transition
program is clinically driven and includes such
program components as psychological readiness,
reality-based anger management training, family-
life management, parenting classes, and literacy
training.

Contracted services include the provision of
onsite schooling, transportational services,
recreational programming, and supervision.

Evidence of Program Effects:

The program reports that, to date, all those who
have entered the two-phased aftercare program have
completed it successfully.

(DHRS) District 6, and service as space available
to DHRS Districts 5 and 8

Program Goals:

o  Resolve issues and promote commitments to
relationships, values, and vocation by inducing a
crisis.
o  Enhance a youth's sense of control and mastery
by creating a consistent, structured, dependable,
predictable, and fair environment.
o  Facilitate social responsibility and self-
control by creating a social environment that
increases understanding of the effects of one's
behavior.
o  Assist youths in internalizing values by
promoting healthy attachment relationships with
caring adults in boot camp and aftercare.
o  Provide an environment where youths answer
questions concerning identity, values, and life
goals.
o  Provide support in a youth's normal environment
so that he can consolidate his new identity.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Committed males between the ages of 14 and 18,
with those who are 16, 17, and 18 years old having
priority.
o  Classified for high-risk residential placement.
o  Committed on a capital, life, first- or second-
degree felony, or a third-degree felony and two
prior felony commitments.
o  No youths with physical and psychological
problems, sex offenses, or history of suicide
attempts.

Boot Camp:

The Manatee County Sheriff's juvenile boot camp
opened in March 1993. Each month, the program
admits platoons of up to 15 youths referred by the
Department of Juvenile Justice. The minimum length
of the program is 12 months, with 4 months in the
boot camp residential phase and 8 months in
aftercare. No expulsions occur in the residential
phase, but this phase is extended for those who
have disciplinary problems. Fourteen certified
deputies and teachers staff the boot camp.

Each day the participants spend 5 hours in
education classes, 2 hours in rational creative
therapy, 1 hour on vital projects (e.g., job-
skills training, interview for jobs, budgeting,
communication with adults), and 1 hour on marching
and drills. Family counseling for participants and
their family members is provided on an as-needed
basis. 

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

Boot camp youths are committed to DHRS. DHRS
continues to supervise youths through aftercare.
All youths who have been in the boot camp for 4
months are released to aftercare, but they may be
returned to boot camp for disciplinary or
performance reasons.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

In July 1993, DHRS entered into a contractual
agreement with Associated Marine Institutes for
the provision of aftercare services for youths
from boot camp and from other DHRS programs within
a 14-county area (halfway houses, community
control agencies, DHRS Level 8 facilities).

Supervision:

All boot camp graduates are required to
participate in one of six Associated Marine
Institutes programs. The 8-month aftercare program
provides a nonresidential setting where youths
receive supervision from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each
weekday. During the first 30- to 60-days of
aftercare, all youths are required to receive
additional or "extended" services at the
institutes from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. At the conclusion
of 30 to 60 days, those youths warranting the
privilege are allowed either to return to their
school of record or to find employment.
Supervision continues with regular home visits,
curfew checks, and monthly visits with aftercare
staff.

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

While lacking the paramilitary emphasis of boot
camp, aftercare activities integrate many of the
rehabilitative and education philosophies
incorporated into boot camp. Additionally, boot
camp and aftercare staff members regularly attend
joint planning and multidisciplinary staffing
sessions to discuss program components and the
progress being made by individual youth in
different aspects of the program.

Aftercare Program Activities:

Program services are provided to each youth based
on an analysis of his student assessment plan,
family assessment plan, and transition plan. Each
of these plans, completed prior to entry into
aftercare, attempts to identify the specific
educational, vocational, rehabilitative, and
social needs of each youth.

Program elements may include the following: 

o  Educational services continuing the education
plan designed in boot camp. 
o  Family counseling.
o  Structured activity time (e.g., SCUBA diving,
swimming, basketball).
o  Job placement with the assistance of a
community coordinator.
o  Substance abuse counseling as needed.
o  Life-skills counseling as needed. 
o  Victim's day designed to increase participants'
awareness of victim suffering.

Evidence of Program Effects:

As reported, program effects are not based on
systematic analysis and are approximations only.
Of 82 youths who have entered the aftercare
program, 4 have been recommitted for offenses that
occurred prior to their entry into boot camp.
Additionally, five or six youths have committed
new delinquency offenses and have been
reincarcerated. The program reports that criminal
activity has been reduced by 95 percent 1 year
after release.

Stuart, Florida

Jurisdiction: Martin County, Florida

Program Goals:

o  Change criminal beliefs and values by providing
educational, vocational, and therapeutic
assistance.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Committed delinquent males.
o  Between the ages of 14 to 18 years.
o  Charged with a second-degree felony or third-
degree felony with two prior felony commitments.

Boot Camp:

Since April 1994, the Martin County Sheriff's
Office has operated a 30-bed residential boot
camp. The 4-month program employs educational,
vocational, and therapeutic programming to change
criminal beliefs and values. Program activities
and components include military dress, military
bearing and courtesies, physical training,
individual and group counseling, substance abuse
education, educational and vocational assessment,
passive and active recreation privileges, and case
management services.

Authority for Aftercare Decisions:

Boot camp youth are committed to the Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services (DHRS). DHRS
continues to supervise youth through aftercare.
All youth who have been in the boot camp for 4
months are released to aftercare, but they may be
returned to boot camp for disciplinary or
performance reasons.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The first graduates of the boot camp entered
aftercare in August 1994. The DHRS has contracted
with the Drug Abuse Treatment Association (DATA)
to provide aftercare services. DATA currently
provides day treatment for non boot camp DHRS
youth who require more intensive supervision than
that provided under standard probation
supervision. This same programming is provided to
boot camp youth. 

Staff include eight counselors, a director of day
treatment, a program supervisor, and an
administrative assistant.

Supervision:

Prior to release from boot camp, a release plan is
developed by boot camp staff and DATA aftercare
participants. All boot camp youth are required to
participate in the DATA program for 4 to 6 months.
Youth are supervised at the program for 12 hours
on weekdays and for 6 hours on Saturday. Caseloads
for aftercare supervisors range between 15 and 30.

Aftercare Program Activities:

DATA emphasizes the development of prosocial
skills. Staff are expected to serve as mentors,
guides, and role models for the youth, exhibiting
the same leadership and other qualities that they
are trying to promote in the youth.

The centerpiece of DATA's program is an accredited
academy staffed with teachers provided under
contract with the Martin County School Board. The
school operates 5 days a week. In addition to the
educational program, DATA's program provides life-
skills classes, substance abuse counseling, and
family counseling.

Evidence of Program Effects:
Data are not yet available.

Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Preparatory
School Boot Camp Program
St. Petersburg, Florida

Jurisdiction: Pinellas County, Florida, and six
additional counties in the Department of Health
and Rehabilitation Services region

Program Goals:

o  Rehabilitate youths by increasing their self-
management, goal-setting, and implementation
skills and providing individualized,
interdisciplinary services.
o  Reintegrate and maintain juveniles in a healthy
family and community.
o  Reduce recidivism.
o  Support and promote public safety.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Male committed youths between the ages of 14
and 18.
o  Eligible for moderate- or high-risk programs
and in need of restrictive placement.
o  Target youths who do not yet have a GED or a
high school diploma.

Boot Camp:

Established in November 1993, the Pinellas County
Boot Camp is a 30-bed paramilitary program that
emphasizes a structured treatment approach. The 4-
month residential program includes paramilitary
training, physical training and exercise,
individual/group counseling, substance abuse
education, a high school educational program, and
recreational activities.

Each youth must demonstrate satisfactory behavior
in each of four programmatic levels to graduate
into aftercare. Youths may be retained at each
level until satisfactory progress is demonstrated,
or they may be transferred to a different type of
program if appropriate.

Authority for Aftercare Decisions:

The Pinellas County Boot Camp holds the authority
to release youth from the boot camp into
aftercare. A court order is required, however, to
release the youth from each aftercare program. The
aftercare provider makes quarterly contact with
each youth and family during a 12-month followup
after release.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The Department of Juvenile Justice (DJ) contracts
with Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives/Eckerd
Leadership Program (ELP) for the provision of
aftercare services for boot camp youths. DJ is the
primary funder, with enhancement funds from the
local children's services tax administered by the
Juvenile Welfare Board (JWB) and inkind support
from community service providers. An onsite
education program is staffed and funded by the
Pinellas County School District.

Supervision:

Boot camp graduates participate in the intensive
aftercare program for a minimum of 8 months. For
the first 4 months, youths report to the aftercare
center for 10 hours each day. Then, the reporting
requirements are reduced and youths return to an
appropriate school or job placement in the
community. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Two structural components facilitate the
integration of boot camp and aftercare: a joint
planning committee composed of representatives
from the boot camp, DJ, JWB, ELP, and the school
system; and a transition team that monitors the
progress of boot camp and aftercare participants
each month. 

Aftercare Program Activities:               

Aftercare program components include:

o  Education: provided onsite during the first 4
months of aftercare.

o  Restitution: youths develop and complete
restitution plans that meet the restitution orders
of the court or those imposed by the program. 

o  Group therapy: focuses on risk factors youths
have identified in their "risk management plans."

o  Family involvement: the program offers family
counseling and parent support groups and referral
services, and it maintains regular contact with
the youth's parents throughout aftercare.

o  Mentors and community support: the program
trains mentors selected by the youth, families,
and staff. Youths and families are assisted to
identify community support teams that may include
mentors, aftercare staff, friends, neighbors, and
family members.

o  Substance abuse prevention/treatment: substance
abuse education and screening are included in the
basic curriculum for all youths. Treatment is
provided through arrangements with a cooperating
agency as needed.

o  Career counseling, job training, and assistance
in locating jobs: career counseling, employability
training, and job search assistance are integral
parts of the program.

Evidence of Program Effects:
No outcome data are yet available.

Boot Camp:

The New York State Division for Youth began
operating the Youth Leadership Academy (YLA) and
its City Challenge day placement aftercare program
in May 1992. The academy (boot camp) is 6 months
in duration, extendable to 9 months for
particularly problematic youths. City Challenge
lasts 3 months. 

The boot camp and the aftercare program are
integrated, sharing a common director and a
leadership philosophy centered on maintaining high
expectations, respect, teaching, role modeling,
and providing a safe, secure environment.

The 16-hour daily program includes: group and
individual counseling, formal classroom education,
experiential education (training), physical
training, hygiene, and recreation. Staff have
military backgrounds and youth wear military
uniforms.

Two programs specially designed for the academy by
academy staff are the Magic Within group
counseling modality and the "Job Book." The Magic
Within is a 60-module group counseling program
that guides participants toward self-awareness,
discusses and clarifies values, and develops goal-
setting and visualization skills. 

Experimental training centers on the "Job Book,"
which consists of 200 individual performance tasks
designed to build personal competence and enhance
esteem. The direct care staff teach a skill, model
it, supervise cadet practice of the task, and
evaluate performance.

Authority for Aftercare Decision: 

Youths are placed with the Division for Youth by
the courts and are selected for the boot camp
based on interviews and desire to attend. Boot
camp graduates automatically attend City
Challenge. No youths are expelled from the program
for poor or inappropriate behavior.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

Aftercare is an integral part of the New York
State Division for Youth's boot camp. The 3-month
day treatment program is run by the boot camp
director. Other staff include a counselor and two
direct care staff with military experience. 

Supervision:

All boot camp graduates are required to
participate in City Challenge, an intensive day
treatment program, for 3 months. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp and aftercare staff maintain close
communication and conduct some activities, i.e.,
home visits, together. In addition, the individual
plans developed at boot camp continue to be
followed at City Challenge. 

Aftercare Program Activities:

Programs include group counseling (Magic Within),
a New York City Board of Education school, family-
development programs, job preparation and
placement, and a variety of community involvement
programs in coordination with the Division for
Youth, city agencies and local churches. The
program stresses community interaction. Youths
take weekly cultural awareness field trips and
guest speakers are brought in for presentations.

Evidence of Program Effects:

Since the program has only recently begun, there
are no data available, but program officials
report that, "Thus far, three platoons have
entered City Challenge with impressive results to
this point."

Cuyahoga County Juvenile Boot Camp
Hudson, Ohio

Jurisdiction: Cuyahoga County, Ohio

Program Goals:

o  Alleviate overcrowding in juvenile correctional
facilities while providing adequate supervision
and treatment.
o  Reduce recidivism.
o  Promote prosocial values, accountability,
discipline, and good work habits.
o  Increase academic achievement and literacy.
o  Reduce alcohol and drug abuse.
o  Provide the court with additional alternatives
for sentencing.

Eligibility Criteria:

o  Males between the ages of 14 and 17. 
o  Adjudicated delinquent and committed to the
Ohio Division of Youth Services (ODYS) or the
Youth Development Center (YDC).
o  Volunteers for the program.
o  No offenders with violent offenses, i.e.
murder, sexual assault, rape, aggravated arson.
o  No serious, habitual offenders or escape risks.
o  No offenders with medical or mental problems or
requiring detoxification.

Boot Camp:

Camp Roulston is a 30-bed boot camp located on the
grounds of the Youth Development Center, a county
operated correctional facility in rural Hudson,
Ohio. Initiated in April 1992 as part of the
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention's boot camp demonstration program, it
is operated by the North American Family Institute
under contract with the Cuyahoga County Juvenile
Court. 

A program manager at the court screens youths
after they have been committed to the ODYS or YDC
and offers eligible youths the opportunity to
volunteer. Candidates are held at the detention
center until the next platoon is composed at the
beginning of each month. The program lasts 90
days.

The normative model, based on the assumption that
treatment must provide youth who have developed
antisocial normative systems with alternative,
positive norms, is the guiding principle of the
program. The program devotes 1 hour daily to one
of the techniques associated with this approach,
guided group interaction counseling sessions.
Military customs, drills, physical training, and
group punishment are used to provide a safe,
structured environment for the treatment.

Other program activities include 6 hours per day
of basic education in preparation for the GED; a
ROPES challenge course; a life-skills curriculum;
and community-service activities.

Authority for Aftercare Decision:

When youths enter the program, their commitments
to ODYS or YDC are suspended, and they are
committed to boot camp. Such a commitment  entails
participation in the 3-month boot camp, as well as
participation in 6 to 9 months of aftercare. The
North American Family Institute's boot camp staff
have the authority to graduate a youth to the
aftercare program, to recycle him to repeat part
of the program, or to dismiss him. Those who are
dismissed have to serve out their sentences
through ODYS or YDC.

Aftercare Host Agency and Staffing:

The North American Family Institute operates the
boot camp at YDC and the aftercare program at City
Center in downtown Cleveland. The two phases of
the program share a company commander. Other City
Center staff include four coordinators, four case
managers, two teachers, two and a half academic
coordinators, and two counselor/drivers. 

Supervision:

There are three progressively decreasing levels of
supervision for the aftercare program. During the
first month youths are transported to the City
Center at 8 a.m. daily, attend an alternative
academy there, and are transported home at 5 p.m.
The next level of supervision permits youths to
have the weekends off and to attend their own
schools. The final supervision level requires
attendance at City Center three nights a week. 

Integration of Aftercare and Boot Camp:

Boot camp and aftercare are different phases of
the same program, operated by the same
organization and employing the same philosophy,
staff training, and organizational supervision.
Although the military aspects of the program are
not transferred to aftercare, the guided group
interaction sessions and the life-skills
curriculum are continued throughout aftercare.

Aftercare Program Activities: 

Participation in a transitional academy is
required for the first month after release and
optional for the remainder of the time in
aftercare. The academy offers courses in English,
mathematics, history, literature, science, and
physical education. Additional activities include:
the life-skills curriculum begun in boot camp;
Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous; a
drug-trafficking prevention program; guided group
interaction counseling; job preparation and
employment training; assistance in locating jobs;
and community service. 

Program Effects:

A process evaluation indicated that during boot
camp youths improved their attitudes, physical
fitness, and math and reading skills.

The status of the 119 youths who entered the
program during the first year of operation was
assessed 10 months after the last platoon entered
the program. Program attrition was low during boot
camp with 5.9 percent of the youth terminated, but
high during aftercare, at 47 percent. Thirty-nine
percent of the youths had been charged with new
offenses, mostly for property crimes.
