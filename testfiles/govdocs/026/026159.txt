ASSIST EMPLOYEES WITH SUCCESS

• 
What is the easiest thing for a supervisor 
to do when they have an employee in 
need of special assistance to be 
successful? (Nothing) 


ASSIST EMPLOYEES WITH SUCCESS


• 
We need to make employees believe that we want to use non-disciplinary options to help them be successful. 
• 
We need to make supervisors understand that helping the employee today “may”
avoid hundreds of hours spent conducting an administrative disciplinary process in the future. 



ASSIST EMPLOYEES WITH SUCCESS 

• 
Discuss issue/s with employee and determine if any intervention is needed. 
• 
If intervention is needed get an understanding with employee about expectations and document these meetings and discussions in employee’s 
notes. 
• 
Identify any risk exposure and future liability. 


 
SECURE EMPLOYEE BUY-IN 
THE BENEFITS 

EMPLOYEE BUY-IN


• 
Union involvement from the beginning 
• 
It helps identify problematic behaviors that could lead to employee failure. 
• 
It will insure supervisory accountability. 
• 
It should reduce liability and future risk to 
the employer. 
• 
The program uses non-disciplinary intervention options for employee success. 



PPD Intervention Options

• 
Mandatory individual training

EMPLOYEE BUY-IN


• 
System access 
• 
The focus group determined we would give all rank and file, civilian and sworn employees access to their own 
information. The unions and employees loved this. “NO SECRETS” 
• 
This was a huge home run for our program. The employees loved it to the tune of a 90% positive response to a survey we conducted. 



• 
Seeing the thresholds 
• 
All employees also have access to their 
own threshold data screen and can see 
exactly where they stand. 
• 
Remember, “NO SECRETS” 


EMPLOYEE BUY-IN



• 
We created an electronic 
notification “data fix” system to help 
correct bad data and document the 
corrections. 
• 
We normally fix data errors within
24 hours which employees love.



EMPLOYEE BUY-IN


Non-electronic referrals 

This was a recommendation from 
members of our police family who 
hadn't been helped in the past and 
struggled with success. 


EMPLOYEE BUY-IN


Who is the first to know when an 
employee is struggling and in need of 
assistance for continued success? 

Supervisors
Fellow employees
Family and friends
Employees themselves




TRAINING 
THE BENEFITS 

Training is critical to the 
success of any early 
intervention program. 

TRAINING


• 
By reviewing historical information about 
police early intervention in America we knew 
employee buy-in was imperative. 
• 
We began planning a massive training and 
education program. 
• 
We started with the smallest group, executive 
staff. They liked it. 
• 
We followed with all first & second level 
supervisors. Surprisingly, these supervisors 
were very reluctant because it’s more work. 



TRAINING


• 
If you want true employee buy-in you better educate. 
• 
Lack of knowledge by the employees you are trying to help will be the death of your program. 
• 
Rumors, suspicion and a common distrust of management are age old problems. Especially if you house the project in Internal Affairs. 
• 
You must educate. 





• 
Executive staff 
– 
About the project 


• 
First and second level supervision 
– 
Access 
– 
Expectations 




• 
Rank and file 
– 
Access 
– 
Expectations 




• 
The bad news is all of this training takes a lot of time when you have 4100 employee department. This applies to everyone. 






TRAINING FOR WHO?



SUPERVISORY 
ACCOUNTABILITY 


• 
We created an extensive CASE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM to make sure that 
all employees get the help they need in a timely manner. 
• 
We make sure that three levels of 
supervision know about each employee review. 
• 
We hold supervisors to a time line (21 days)
for supervisory review and response. 


SUPERVISORY ACCOUNTABILITY



• 
So what else did we find out? 
• 
We needed to do more supervisory training on what 
expectations we had of supervisors when conducting an employee review then making them responsible. 
• 
Also how to better deal with employees in need. (Moretraining on communications and coaching skills &
information about generational issues) 
• 
We are looking for employee success using a non-
disciplinary process. This concept is new to policing since we have depended on discipline for change for so 
many years. 
• 
You must educate and make the students believe in the 
project for success. 




COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 
 

Community involvement?


• 
If you haven’t figured it out the community you serve is critical to the success of your police organization. 
• 
When it comes to problem solving you need to invite them to the table and let them 
participate in your project and hear the success stories. 
• 
The sooner they realize that we are human,
have problems and need help for success like them, the better the relationship will become. 
• 
Allow them to suggest changes to system. 



In summary 

The benefits of Early Intervention


• 
Early Identification and Intervention is a 
lot more than an electronic data base 
with fixed thresholds. 
• 
It’s more than an electronic case 
management system. 
• 
Don’t forget the “HUMAN ELEMENT” 
and the ability to do referrals. 
• 
And don’t forget you’re a Police Family!



• 
A successful early identification and 
intervention program will help your 
police family and get your agency one 
step closer to your other family. (The 
Community)
