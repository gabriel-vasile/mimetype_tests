SUMMARY: The Postal Service is removing the Rules of Practice in 
Proceedings Relative to Disciplinary Action for Violations of 
Restrictions on Post-Employment Activity.

DATES: Effective Date:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Postal Service is removing the Rules of 
Practice in Proceedings Relative to Disciplinary Action for Violations 
of Restrictions on Post-Employment Activity. These provisions have been 
superseded by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch issued by the Office of Government Ethics. This 
revision is a mandated charge in the agency rules of procedure before 
the Judicial Officer and, therefore, it is appropriate for its adoption 
by the Postal Service to become effective immediately.
    Accordingly, the Postal Service removes and reserves 39 CFR part 
956 as set forth below:
