SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Postal Service is removing the Rules of

of Restrictions on Post-Employment Activity. These provisions have been 
superseded by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch issued by the Office of Government Ethics. This 
revision is a mandated change in the agency rules of procedure before 
the Judicial Officer and, therefore, it is appropriate for its adoption 
by the Postal Service to become effective immediately.
