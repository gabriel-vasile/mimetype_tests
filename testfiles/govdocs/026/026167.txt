NR 2002-96
For Immediate Release						
December 17, 2002

Agencies Propose Disciplinary Action Rules for Accountants and 
Accounting Firms Performing Certain Audit Services

The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies today invited 
public comment on proposed rules governing their authority to 
take disciplinary actions against independent public accountants 
and accounting firms that perform audit and attestation services 
required by section 36 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

The proposed rules would establish procedures under which the 
agencies could, for good cause, remove, suspend, or bar an 
accountant or firm from performing audit and attestation 
services for insured depository institutions with assets of 
$500 million or more.  They would permit immediate suspensions 
in limited circumstances.

Under the proposed rules, violations of law, certain negligent 
conduct, reckless violations of professional standards or lack 
of qualifications to perform auditing services would be considered 
good cause to remove, suspend or bar an accountant or firm from 
providing services for such an insured institution.  Also, under 
the proposed rules an accountant or accounting firm may not perform 
audit services as prescribed under section 36 if the accountant 
or firm has been removed, suspended, or debarred by one of the 
agencies, or if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a state licensing 
authority takes certain disciplinary actions against the 
accountant or firm.

The proposed rules are being issued by the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 
the Office of Thrift Supervision.  While they would amend each 
agency's rules of practice separately, they would have uniform 
application for each agency.

Comments are due 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.
