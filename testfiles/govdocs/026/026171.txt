  SAMPLE NOTICE OF REPRIMAND

This sample letter is a reprimand by a FIRST LEVEL SUPERVISOR.  Minor editorial changes may be required if other than the immediate supervisor is proposing this action 

NOTE 1:  Supervisors are authorized to sign and issue notices, receive and consider employees' answers, and make recommendations and final decisions on actions covered. Normally, first level supervisors perform these functions, although higher level supervisors may perform any or all of them, as well.  

NOTE 2:  The servicing Personnel Office is the primary local source of authoritative information and interpretation of policy and procedures concerning discipline and adverse actions and shares in management's responsibility to ensure that actions have merit and comply with governing requirements.  Accordingly, written notices of final decisions for disciplinary and adverse actions must be coordinated with the SPO before delivery to employees.  

NOTE 3:  Ensure the employee initials and dates receipt of this notice and the original copy is provided to the employee, a copy is filed in the Supervisor's Employee Work Folder, and a copy is provided to the SPO for maintenance in the case folder and employee's Official Personnel Folder.

NOTE 4:  If the employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, be sure 
to review all applicable provisions prior to issuing a letter of reprimand (or any disciplinary action).  Supervisors are strongly encouraged to contact their SPO for further information and assistance in this regard.
