DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

Federal Emergency Management Agency

44 CFR Part 65

[Docket No. FEMA-B-7474]

 
Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations

AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency, DHS.

ACTION: Interim rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This interim rule lists communities where modification of the 
Base (1% annual-chance) Flood Elevations (BFEs) is appropriate because 
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates 
will be calculated from the modified BFEs for new buildings and their 
contents.

DATES: These modified BFEs are currently in effect on the dates listed 
in the table below and revise the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) in 
effect prior to this determination for the listed communities.
    From the date of the second publication of these changes in a 
newspaper of local circulation, any person has ninety (90) days in 
which to request through the community that the Mitigation Division 
Director of FEMA reconsider the changes. The modified BFEs may be 
changed during the 90-day period.

ADDRESSES: The modified BFEs for each community are available for 
inspection at the office of the Chief Executive Officer of each 
community. The respective addresses are listed in the table below.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William R. Blanton, Jr., Engineering 
Management Section, Mitigation Division, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-3151.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The modified BFEs are not listed for each 
community in this interim rule. However, the address of the Chief 
Executive Officer of the community where the modified BFE 
determinations are available for inspection is provided.
    Any request for reconsideration must be based on knowledge of 
changed conditions or new scientific or technical data.
    The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood 
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are in accordance 
with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., 
and with 44 CFR part 65.
    For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is 
shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
    The modified BFEs are the basis for the floodplain management 
measures that the community is required to either adopt or to show 
evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain 
qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP).
    These modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management 
criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. 
They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any 
existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain 
management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter 
requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by the 
other Federal, State, or regional entities. The changes BFEs are in 
accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.
    National Environmental Policy Act. This interim rule is 
categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, 
Environmental Consideration. An environmental impact assessment has not 
been prepared.
    Regulatory Flexibility Act. As flood elevation determinations are 
not within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-
612, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
    Regulatory Classification. This interim rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 
51735.
    Executive Order 13132, Federalism. This interim rule involves no 
policies

[[Page 70886]]

that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism.
    Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. This interim rule 
meets the applicable standards of Executive Order 12988.
