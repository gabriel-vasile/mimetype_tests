<p><font color="#004000">The miniature masterpieces that we call bonsai
and penjing are the pinnacle of gardening skill, and the National Bonsai
and Penjing Museum has one of the largest collections of these timeless
trees in North America.&nbsp; The Japanese art of bonsai, and its precursor,
the Chinese art of penjing, are rooted in the traditions of Asian culture.&nbsp;
The placement of branches, styling, and the pot all convey deep symbolism
and reverence for nature.

<p>The National Bonsai and Penjing Museum began when
Japanese bonsai enthusiasts in the Nippon Bonsai Association donated 53
bonsai to the people of the United States to commemorate the U.S. Bicentennial
in 1976.&nbsp; The collection has grown steadily with the addition of pieces
from American bonsai masters and penjing from China.&nbsp; Today, three
pavilions house about 150 plants.&nbsp; The International Pavilion is a
focal point that celebrates the related art forms of viewing stones and
ikebana, a Japanese style of flower arranging.&nbsp; Throughout the year,
you may also find exhibits featuring the work of local bonsai enthusiasts
and pieces from the permanent collection with special seasonal interest
in the International Pavilion.  

<p><b>Be sure to also vist our online <a href="../../Gardens/collections/VirtualTours/BonsaiVirtualTour.html">Bonsai Virtual Tour</a>.</b>

<p>The concept of an internationally acclaimed collection
of bonsai and penjing was conceived by former Arboretum Director Dr. John
Creech in 1972.&nbsp; In 1976, the Nippon Bonsai Association of Japan bestowed
on the American people a gift of 53 bonsai and six viewing stones.&nbsp;
The Japanese Pavilion was constructed as a result, and became the home
of the new specimens. The collection grew again in 1986 with the gift of
Chinese penjing from Dr. Yee-sun Wu and Shu-ying Lui.&nbsp; The construction
of the Dr. Yee-sun Wu Chinese Pavilion recognizes this important gift and
provides a home where his gift can be properly displayed.&nbsp; The growing
popularity of bonsai in North America was recognized with the construction
of the John Naka North American Pavilion.&nbsp; In it resides one of the
most extensive and diverse collections of bonsai from masters in North
America, including American master John Naka's <i>Goshin</i>, a spectacular
forest-style planting of junipers.

<p>The gardens in the National Bonsai and Penjing
Museum are more than a backdrop for the bonsai and penjing pieces.&nbsp;
The Ellen Gordon Allen Entrance Garden primes you for the experience of
visiting the museum with its sculpted pines.&nbsp; The Cryptomeria Walk
calms your soul as you pass through the shade of the evergreen branches.&nbsp;
The Japanese Stroll garden prepares you for the formality and spirituality
found in the Japanese Pavilion that is home to the Museum’s first and oldest
pieces.&nbsp; The Yamaguchi Garden, featuring a variety of plants native
to North America, echoes the less formal styling and diversity of inspirations
characteristic of American masters who contributed pieces in the North
American Pavilion.&nbsp; The pagoda-like entrance to the Chinese Pavilion
and the nearby serpentine wall give you a sense of the ancient roots of
penjing and the mysticism of Asian art forms.

<p>The <a href="http://www.bonsai-nbf.org">National Bonsai Foundation</a> 
was organized around the mission of promoting bonsai
in North America, particularly by supporting the development of the National
Bonsai and Penjing Museum.&nbsp; The Arboretum would provide the space
and the resources for the maintenance and display of the specimens.&nbsp;
The National Bonsai Foundation would provide the springboard for immensely
successful efforts to raise the private funds necessary to build the proper
museum structures to house and support the collection.&nbsp; Through the
generous gifts of the bonsai community and others, the Museum grew dramatically
in the early 1990s.&nbsp; The Haruo Kaneshiro Tropical Conservatory was
added for tender bonsai specimens, as well as a behind-the-scenes greenhouse
for holding of specimens under development.&nbsp; New pieces added in recent
years have further expanded the variety of styles and species represented
in the collection.&nbsp; The National Bonsai Foundation continues to play
a key role in the development of the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum.</font>

<p>The National Bonsai and Penjing Museum is undoubtedly one of Washington's
key attractions for plant lovers.&nbsp; You will want to budget ample time
to see the specimens and gardens at a leisurely pace, and an hour can easily
pass by before you have a chance to admire the pieces.&nbsp; Pathways are
currently constructed of gravel and stone, but the phased plan for construction
and development of the Museum will make it accessible to the handicapped.&nbsp;
The Museum's hours are shorter than those of other collections and you
may visit anytime between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm except for federal holidays November 
through February, when the museum is closed. &nbsp; The tranquility of Asian art
forms is sure to leave the most tired soul refreshed after a visit.&nbsp;
Recharged, you can make the short walk across Meadow Road to the <a href="herb.html">National
Herb Garden</a> or visit the aquatic plants, koi, and U.S. National Arboretum
introductions in the gardens surrounding the <a href="admin.html">Administration
Building</a>.

<font color="#663300" size="+2">Special Focus: The Enduring Appeal of Ikebana<br></font><br>
The Washington, D.C. Chapter No. 1 of Ikebana International, celebrated its 50th anniversary at the U.S. National Arboretum with an exhibition September 30 through October 2, 2006. Ikebana International promotes the ancient art of ikebana,   or Japanese flower arranging. In addition, in 1979, the Washington, D.C.   Chapter No. 1 donated a rare ikebana book collection to the arboretum in memory of their founder, Ellen Gordon   Allen. As part of the celebration, the arboretum has made this unique book digitized and available online.
