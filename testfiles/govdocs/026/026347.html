                    <strong class="title2">FACILITIES- </strong><strong class="title2">Ron Wilson,  Facilities Planning Director, ORF</strong>
                  <p><strong><em>Rt. 355 Streetscape Improvement Project</em></strong><br>
Mr. Wilson provided the following activities &amp; milestone  information for the project, which received its Notice to Proceed in February:</p>
                  <p>- Initiation: months 1 through 3 (gather &amp; review  existing information; conduct interviews &amp; summarize)</p>
                  <p>- Draft Plan: months 4 through 7 (develop &amp; review  framework diagrams; develop 3 alternative concepts &amp; present to CLC for  comment; select preferred alternative for draft plan basis, brief CLC &amp;  present to NCPC)</p>
                  <p>- Summary Design Guidelines: months 8 through 10 (develop  recommended palette of landscape materials, furniture &amp; hardscape  materials; present to CLC for comment)</p>
                  <p>- Final Plan: months 11 &amp; 12 (prepare &amp; document)</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Avoidance of Future Impact Reduction Retrofits</em></strong><br>
                    Mr. Wilson summarized 3 categories of lessons learned since  the last master plan update; namely, campus wide, transportation &amp;  environmental issues.&nbsp; NIH has every  intention of incorporating past experience into future planning objectives  &amp; approaches.</p>
                  <p>The categories address the following specific areas of  community interest:</p>
                  <p>- Campus wide: public access &amp; BRAC impacts<br>
                    - Transportation: parking ratio &amp; growth limits<br>
                    - Environment: noise, lights, reforestation/screening,  buffer zone &amp; utility (e.g. natural gas) services</p>
                  <p>With regard to screening, Ms. Harnish supports  &quot;pre-screening&quot; of future tall buildings near the perimeter, such as  the multi-level parking garage planned to be adjacent to the south side buffer.  &nbsp;Since it takes 10 or 20 years for  screening to mature, she recommended moving ahead with the screening now.&nbsp; She suggested evergreens, such as <em>Cryptomeria</em> or holly. </p>
                  <p>Mr. Coleman assured the group that he had informed Lynn  Mueller (grounds keeping manager) about the prescreening idea and asked him to  survey existing screening gaps, where future screening might be needed, what species  might be appropriate, and where prescreening should be located to avoid  interference with future construction. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilson cautioned that budget constraints could prevent  taking any action this fiscal year. &nbsp;Mr.  Coleman thought it significant that Dan Wheeland, Director of the Office of  Research Facilities, supports better screening.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the buffer zone, Mr. Schofer supports the  master plan provision that no further facilities be constructed in the buffer  (including parking lots) and that temporary facilities should be removed if  they haven't already been.</p>
                  <p>With respect to parking ratios, Mr. Oberlander suggested continued  monitoring of parking facility occupancy since gas price increases are likely  to increase future transit use by both staff &amp; visitors &amp; thus reduce  the need for parking below what previous master plans may have assumed.</p>
                  <p class="title2"><strong>ENVIRONMENT - </strong><strong>Dennis Coleman [Substituted Agenda Item Based on  5/6/08 Publication of BRAC RoD]</strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>BRAC EIS Record of Decision</em></strong><br>
Last month, the Navy published its final Environmental  Impact Statement (EIS) for the expansion proposed under the 2005 Base  Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law. &nbsp;The  next step was publication of its Record of Decision (RoD) on 5/6/08.&nbsp; The RoD documents the EIS mitigations that  the Navy actually commits to providing. &nbsp;As a result, Mr. Coleman searched the RoD for  &quot;affirmative declarations&quot; of actions to be taken by the Navy.&nbsp; He presented a 1-page table summarizing  these.&nbsp; CLC members asked for electronic  copies, which Mr. Coleman agreed to provide.</p>
                  <p>Most of the RoD commitments relate to secondary impacts of  BRAC such as dust, noise, erosion, habitat and historical preservation.</p>
                  <p>The Navy has not changed its position with respect to traffic  congestion, the main impact.&nbsp; The Navy will  cooperate on implementing traffic mitigations outside their fence line, but is  unable to fund them. &nbsp;They will request that  DoD (through its Defense Access Roads or DAR program) fund at least a portion  of some improvements.&nbsp; These were  originally expected to include extra turn &amp; storage lanes that directly  connect to base access gates on 355 &amp; Jones Bridge Road, plus improved  Metro access via a tunnel or bridge across 355 or elevators on the east side of  355.</p>
                  <p>The scope of turn &amp; storage lanes has been reduced, and  the elevator option is apparently preferred.&nbsp;  DAR funding will be sought only for the intersection of 355 &amp; North Wood Road.&nbsp; A northbound lane on MD355 to allow left  turns into NIH&rsquo;s CVIF, and an extension of current left turn lane storage on  southbound 355 into the North Wood    Road gate are now specified.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>The Navy&rsquo;s intention is unclear, since Mr. Moss is certain  that NIH has no agreement with the Navy to inspect any of the base's commercial  traffic, and the proposed configuration seems to prepare for that eventuality.&nbsp; Mr. Coleman also noted that the Navy intends  to fund a study of whether a new traffic signal at 355 &amp; North Wood Road is warranted, and if so  will ask the state to fund it. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Ms. Michaels said that a left-hand turn onto North Wood Road  would complicate traffic.&nbsp; Because it is  a state highway, she thought that lobbying by citizen&rsquo;s groups would be  effective in revisiting the wisdom of this option. &nbsp;Mr. Wilson said that the state does not want  this left-hand turn when the CVIF was planned. &nbsp;In fact, Mr. Moss thought that the state was  going to install a concrete median in front of the CVIF, so it would not be physically  possible to turn left there. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Mr. Oberlander suspected that much of what is listed in the  ROD will not be implemented, and that the purpose of this document is simply to  satisfy a requirement that the EIS process end with an RoD. &nbsp;He expects that the Navy will only deal with  BRAC transportation impacts when they eventually find out the hard way that patients  and employees cannot get in and out of the base. </p>
                  <p>The RoD does commit the Navy to update its transportation  management and master plans, but not now.</p>
                  <p class="title2"><strong>TRANSPORTATION&mdash;</strong><strong>Brad Moss [for Tom Hayden, Director, Division of  Amenities &amp; Transportation Svcs.], ORS</strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>NIH Police Representative</em></strong><br>
Mr. Moss introduced Cpl. John Ritch, the new NIH Community  Policing Coordinator. Officer Ritch distributed his business card and invited  community members to call him to report problems.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>North Entrance to NIH off MD355</em></strong><br>
                    In February, Ms. Volz reported a pedestrian safety issue at  the northernmost entrance to NIH from MD355, which has acquired the name,  Speeders' Drive.&nbsp; In summary, drivers tend  to speed and ignore the crosswalk during AM rush hour; pedestrians and cyclists  tend to ignore the crosswalk and marked pathways; and several near miss  accidents have occurred. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>To orient the group about the location of interest, Mr.  Coleman showed a 2006 aerial view of the northeast corner of the campus focused  on the driveway of concern. &nbsp;Mr. Moss  distributed a packet of photos and information Mr. Hayden had prepared. &nbsp;Comparing the 2008 photos and 2006 aerial  view, it was obvious that NIH had tried several remedies.</p>
                  <p>Officer Ritch, Mr. Hayden, and Mr. Mueller will be actively  involved in dealing with this situation and are reviewing possible remedies  beyond what has been tried so far (signs, bollards, boulders &amp; painted  roadway surfaces).&nbsp; Escalated solutions  include rumble strips (grooves dug into the road instead of bumps on top of the  road) and speed humps. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Speed bumps have been vetoed for now because of possible  damage to cars and hindrance to snow plows. &nbsp;Mr. Oberlander noted the difference between speed  bumps and speed humps.&nbsp; Ms. Lueders  observed that the county has dozens of 20-mile-per-hour speed humps in  neighborhoods all around NIH, and they don't seem to worry about damaging cars  or impeding snow removal, so NIH need not be so timid.</p>
                  <p>The driveway faces 3 lanes of traffic southbound on 355 and  is about 300 feet long.&nbsp; The pedestrian  crossing is less than 100 feet off 355, which may be part of the problem.&nbsp; After negotiating the driveway, commuters  make a 90-degree right-hand turn through the security gate and onto the campus. </p>
                  <p>Officer Ritch said the Police Department has considered  parking a police car in plain view of driveway traffic, but that could create  another distraction or obstacle for inbound commuters. &nbsp;Because the distance between the crosswalk and  the sidewalk is so short, ORS has also considered extending the sidewalk, which  would put the crosswalk farther away from 355. In addition to rumble strips, a  flashing caution light is another option.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Oberlander said that a high-traffic, pedestrian walkway  crosses a high traffic driveway, which is not an optimal design. &nbsp;He suggested closing that entrance and  bringing commuters onto the campus via North Drive, which requires a 90-degree  turn off 355. &nbsp;Any resulting gridlock  sounds better than pedestrian injuries. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Mr. Moss noted that pedestrians and bicyclists are also at  fault and that drivers seem not to know that the speed limit there is 5 miles  per hour. &nbsp;ORS will try to raise  awareness by sending out a global e-mail to all employees and contractors  reminding them that pedestrians always have the right of way at NIH. &nbsp;Mr. Moss added that they have to badge-in many  vehicles at rush hour, so the absence of the angled entryway would cause  traffic back-ups. &nbsp;He added that the  driveway is only open between 6 and 10 AM and that the currently short distance  between 355 and the pedestrian crosswalk limits signage possibilities.</p>
                  <p>Recognizing that ORS is doing all it can, Mr. Schofer  reiterated that the main issue is the poor design of this entrance. &nbsp;As a result, it will be very difficult to make  it work effectively regardless what is done. &nbsp;Mr. Coleman added that the Navy wants to put a  traffic light on 355 near this driveway, which may solve the problem since no one  will be able to speed anywhere in the area. </p>
                  <p>Mr. Moss thought that a sign that tells a driver how fast s/he  is going might help. &nbsp;He added that the short  length of the driveway and the background traffic on 355 precludes radar  enforcement of the speed limit. Mr. Oberlander suggested constructing an arched  pedestrian bridge.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. Coleman &amp; Mr. Moss have personally contacted  NIH Police Chief Hitton about this issue.&nbsp;  Mr. Coleman assured the group that it now has appropriate visibility,  and Officer Ritch has been assigned to monitor the situation and develop a  solution. &nbsp;If all else fails, and the  police launch even a brief ticketing campaign, Mr. Coleman feels sure that it  wouldn't take long for drivers to get the idea that they should slow down.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Buffer Facilities&mdash;Dennis Coleman, OCL Director, CLC Co-Chair [for Mr.  Hayden, ORS]</em></strong><br>
                    In March, CLC members asked when they see implementation of the  landscaped, 250-foot-wide buffer specified in the master plan to insulate the  community from NIH activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;In April, Mr. Hayden provided copies of a 2006  aerial photo and asked that CLC members mark the areas they are concerned about.  &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Mr. Coleman and Ms. Miller (CLC Co-Chair) used a 2004 master  plan drawing of the buffer to accurately determine its location and transpose  that location onto the aerial photo.&nbsp; They  then circled &amp; labeled every facility (including both buildings &amp;  parking lots) that occupies part of the buffer.&nbsp;  Finally, Mr. Coleman listed the 13 facilities, noting their description  and status, whether known or assumed. &nbsp;Subtracting &quot;grandfathered&quot; and  &quot;required&quot; facilities (which are understood by CLC members to be  permanently in the buffer) left 5 question marks.&nbsp; </p>
                  Mr. Hayden will be asked to confirm or correct the  status of each facility and fill in the question marks at the next CLC meeting.
                  <p class="title2"><strong>SPECIAL PROJECTS&mdash;Tony  Clifford, Chief Engineer, ORF</strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>South Lawn Drainage</em></strong><br>
                    Since 2003, the community has been concerned about flooding  and soggy surface conditions on the south lawn public recreation area.&nbsp; In 2007, the County admitted that the storm  water was coming from their system.&nbsp; A  consulting study funded by NIH recommended installing an underground 24-inch  pipe to divert water to North    Brook Lane, where it could reenter the County's  system. &nbsp;In early 2008, the county&rsquo;s  Department of Public Works and Transportation (DPWT) changed their view and advised  NIH that it was NIH&rsquo;s responsibility to accommodate drainage onto its property  from offsite sources, including the county&rsquo;s 21-inch drain pipe. &nbsp;Furthermore, it is NIH&rsquo;s responsibility to implement  a solution if such drainage poses a problem. </p>
                  <p>ORF Director Dan Wheeland (who is a registered engineer)  reviewed the issue and suggested a cooperative solution involving both NIH and  County resources. &nbsp;NIH would install a  470-foot, 24-inch-diameter underground stormwater line parallel to NIH&rsquo;s south  property line from Maple Ridge    Road to North    Brook Lane, with a manhole at either end. The  pipe location would parallel existing underground utility lines. The  new line would be perforated and surrounded with gravel to support filtration  of water back into the soil during mild storms and redirection of water  eastward during heavy storms. &nbsp;This would  be more environmentally friendly than the previous non-perforated design, which  environmental staff had opposed. &nbsp;The  pipe would be 5 to 6 feet underground. &nbsp;The County would install at their expense, connections  between the perforated pipe and the 21 inch source pipe at its west end and the  drainage system at its east end.</p>
                  <p>NIH has already put in a pipe to direct North Brook Lane discharge, and a surface  grate to try to deal with the ponding in the South Lawn. &nbsp;However, the grate was installed before the  origin of the water was apparent, and the pipe connected to it is only 8 inches  in diameter. &nbsp;Moreover, soil erosion  causes the grate to be occluded with mud most of the time. &nbsp;The County's western connection to the  proposed NIH pipe would also remedy the erosion and mosquito habitat issues now  being caused by the open 21 inch pipe.</p>
                  <p>This environmentally friendly solution would cost about  $100,000, including planning. Mr. Clifford did not know what the cost would be  for the County to connect to it. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>To advance this plan, Mr. Clifford must meet with Bruce  Johnson, DWPT&rsquo;s capital project manager.&nbsp;  He needs to be sold on the benefits of such a cooperative solution and  then details can be worked out. &nbsp;NIH could  then conceivably proceed with design work this year and budget for construction  in FY2009. &nbsp;Mr. Clifford will brief the  CLC on progress at forthcoming meetings.</p>
                  <p>Ms. Rice asked what would become of the beautiful bald cyprus  trees when the water retention pond is installed. Mr. Clifford assured her that  Mr. Mueller is working on the pond and is very attuned to saving trees in  general and these trees in particular.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Clifford concluded that stagnant water was the original  problem. He does not want to keep coming up with interim solutions and spending  money on things that won&rsquo;t work. This solution, with percolating pipes, allows  water to return to the soil. He feels sanguine because the county suggested  this solution, but did not recommend it because they didn&rsquo;t want to pay for it,  and because it was perceived to be environmentally unfriendly until Mr.  Wheeland suggested a perforated pipe. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Mr. Coleman pointed out that using County interest in  building a 3 acre storm water retention pond on NIH property to leverage their  participation in a South Lawn solution is probably not a constructive option  because it could compromise or delay another drainage solution that is 20 times  bigger (~$2M).</p>
                  <p class="title2"><strong>INFORMATION  FORUM&mdash;Dennis Coleman, OCL Director, CLC Co-Chair</strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>Helicopters</em></strong><br>
ORS has completed a report on helicopters and regulations  governing them, which will be presented in at least 2 parts&mdash;1 in June and 1 in  July. &nbsp;He showed the cover page on which  14 helicopters that now fly into Suburban and Navy helipads are pictured to  scale and labeled with their model number.&nbsp;  The latter determines power, performance and capacity, which govern much  of the noise and safety impact.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Other Issues</em></strong><br>
                    In the interest of time, Mr. Coleman drew everyone&rsquo;s  attention to the underlined (higher priority) items in the Information Forum packet.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Comments and Concerns</em></strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Dr.       Ozarin related a satisfying experience when her car recently broke down       outside NIH. &nbsp;She went to the police       station in Building 31, where they called a tow truck for her and then       sent a policeman to wait with her until the tow truck arrived. &nbsp;She had no NIH badge with her and thought       their response neighborly enough that she wrote to Dr. Zerhouni commending       the police officers.</p>
                    </li>
                       <li>
                         <p>Ms. Lueder       has observed that NIH visitors coming from the beltway to Old Georgetown Road       need more informative signs than the one sign that now reads, &ldquo;Visitors&rsquo; Entrance,       South Drive.&rdquo;       &nbsp;For unaccustomed visitors, it is       not always clear how to get into NIH. &nbsp;Mr. Moss reported that ORS is aware of       the problem and is in the process of a &ldquo;way-finding plan&quot; to coincide       with this summer's opening of Gateway        Center.</p>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                         <p>Mr.       Coleman reminded everyone that next month BRAC construction starts at the       Navy base. &nbsp;A new construction       entrance is to be created on 355.&nbsp;       Up to 50 cement mixers, dump trucks and other vehicles are to be       accommodated on the front lawn staging area. &nbsp;</p>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                         <p>Mr. Schools       added that many of the base's service facilities will be closed during the       30 month construction period, while wounded soldiers continue to return       from Iraq.       &nbsp;The Navy has approached the NIH       R&amp;W Assn. for help in dealing with this.&nbsp; Mr. Schools&rsquo; office has been organizing       and coordinating community donations of individual entertainment items       such as DVDs. </p>
