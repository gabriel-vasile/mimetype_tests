Mediated Settlement Agreement for Sequoia National Forest, Section B.  Giant Sequoia GrovesMaster BibliographyIn the process of data compilation for the evaluation of giant sequoia groves under the Mediated Settlement Agreement, we compiled a digital bibliography for giant sequoia groves on the Sequoia National Forest and for the entire Sierra Nevada.  This was done using the bibliographic database program EndNote 2.  This master bibliography consists of data that we were not able to include in the printed report due to space constraints.  There are over 700 references on giant sequoia ecology and management in the database and an output file of them follows.  The data are also contained in the ~ADDENDUM/~A_C08DAT directory in three formats:  EndNote 2 database (GS_BIB.EN2), ASCII text (GS_BIB.TXT), and Microsoft Word 6.0 (GS_BIB.DOC).Agamirova, M.

Canadian Journal of Botany 56(1): 57-62. 	Dead needles of Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris, P. leucodermis and Sequoia gigantea were immersed in a stream for 28 days and then examined for conidiophores of aquatic hyphomycetes. These fungi colonize untreated needles. Numbers of species and conidiophores were significantly higher on needles treated with steam before immersion than on untreated needles; both values were also higher on cut surfaces (mesophyll) than on intact surfaces (epidermis with cuticle) of longitudinally halved needles. Addition of untreated needle powder (Sequoia, P. leucodermis) to malt extract agar depressed linear growth of pure cultures of 5 aquatic hyphomycetes [Anquillospora pseudolongissima, Clavariopsis aquatica, Lemonniera aquatica, Tetracladium marchalianum, Tricladium angulatum]. The inhibition persisted when a 0.1 .mu.m membrane filter was placed between medium and fungal cultures. On water agar, by itself unsuitable for growth, low doses of needle powder allowed growth of the same fungi. At higher doses, inhibition again became predominant. Steam distillation of needle powder yielded 3 fractions: solid residue, soluble residue and steam distillate. Steam distillate did not influence fungal growth on the 2 media, while the other 2 fractions supported growth on water agar but did not lead to a clear dosage-effect curve on malt extract agarBaerlocher, F. and J.

After evaporating the solvents, extracts and extracted powder were added to nutrient medium to examine their effect on linear expansion of 5 aquatic Hyphomycetes [Anguillospora pseudolongissima, Clavariopsis aquatica, Lemonnlera aquatica, Tetracladium marchalianum and Tricladium angulatum]. All extracts depressed fungal growth, the inhibition being strongest with the 2 alcoholic extracts. The FeCl3 test indicated phenolic compounds in the alcohol and water but not in the petroleum-ether extracts. There was no correlation between the colorimetrically determined phenol content of an extract and its antifungal activity. Untreated needle powder strongly inhibited fungal growth, as did petroleum-ether or water-extracted powder. By contrast, alcohol-extracted powder did not inhibit fungal growth. The inhibitory effect of methanol extract was much more pronounced at a pH range of 4.0-4.5 than at 5.5-6.5Baker, R. S. B. (1943). The redwoods.

None of the cuttings rooted when continuously kept on medium containing the auxin NAA and vitamin D2. Peroxidase activity of all those cuttings on NAA + D2 first increased during the 7-9 first days and decreased in the days after. Rooting was obtained by transfer of the cuttings after periods longer than 7-9 days from the NAA + D2 inductive medium to a basal medium supplemented or not with rutin (expressive medium). The rooting capacity was emphasized by rutin treatment and was in correlation with the peroxidase peak reached on the NAA + D2 medium.

Regionalization of tree and shrub selections for cultivation in Poland. Arbor Kornickie 25: 329-376. 	The selections of trees and shrubs which are most valuable and most adapted to local site conditions were described. The list contained 669 spp. and varieties of woody plants. This is connected with the need to popularize many new ornamental varieties and new varieties adapted to particularily difficult urban environments. The tree plantings in the new open muncipal districts require diversification since a greater assortment of various species and varieties is possible. In Poland, 5 climatic regions were delineated: the western zone, the transitory zone, the eastern zone, the southern sub-montane zone and the montane zone. The western climatic zone favored the introduction of many ornamental trees and shrubs known for their sensitivity to winter frosts although exotic trees such as ebony (Diospyros lotus), bamboos (Sinarundinaria nitida) or sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) can be grown. The transitory zone has an intermediate climate. The eastern zone has a cold, more continental climate. The vegetative period is almost 2 mo. shorter than within the neighboring zones (Tarnow, Pszczyna). Only woody plants can grow there which are adapted to long lasting very cold and windy winters, e.g., Acer negundo, Physocarpus opulifolius and Rhus typhina. The submontane zone is defined by other climatic factors. The Subcarpathian valleys and the Silesian lowland belong to the warmest regions of Poland. This characteristic, the abundance of precipitation and the most intense solar radiation throughout Poland permit the introduction of many valuable trees and shrubs from genera Magnolia, Deutzia, Weigela, Juglans and others. The montane zone is different, covering the lower reaches of the Carpathian and Sudety Mountains. Successful cultivation of various species including some evergreen ones like those from genera Rhododendron, Pieris and Chamacecyparis is possibleBon, M.

During the elongation phase on the medium containing AC, the growing upper part of the juvenile clone microcuttings contained less polyphenols than the lower part, while this difference was not observed in mature material. Plantlets growing on AC-free medium had almost identical polyphenol levels, which greatly increased after the seventh week of culture both in the tissues and the medium. The effect of AC on microcutting growth as well as the significance of polyphenols for micropropagation are discussedBon, M. C. (1988a).

Buchholz during budbreak were determined. GDP and GTP contents were significantly higher in the juvenile clone apex than in the mature ones, whereas there was no difference in ATP concentration between the two materials. In vivo, induction of protein synthesis was similar in the two clones after 10 min of [35S]-methionine labeling. The increase of [35S]-methionine-tRNAs and labeled proteins continued up to 30 min for the juvenile clone. They markedly declined for the mature clone after 10 min. Only the diminution of this in vivo protein synthesis was well correlated with a decrease in GTP contentBon, M. C. and O. Monteuuis (1991).

Forest Ecology and Management 3(4): 307-328. 	This hypothesis was examined using 5-point pattern analysis techniques. The results showed statistically significant levels of contagion for most of the tree classes analyzed, thereby demonstrating the presence of aggregations in the giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest community. Both distance and quadrat methods of analysis also showed that older and larger trees have a tendency to be uniformly dispersed. Aggregations tended to decrease in size as the age of the trees increased. However, giant sequoia was unique in that its aggregations did not tend to decrease in size as the trees grew older. The quadrat methods also showed that most aggregations in the giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest community range in size 135-1600 m2. These results are compared with the pattern produced by a prescribed burn designed to reduce fuels and restore natural conditions. The prescribed burn reduced the density of trees but it did not significantly alter the pattern of trees in the 41-60 yr and older age classes. The management implications of these findings are discussedBonnicksen, T. M. and E. C. Stone (1982a).

Alternative objectives put forward by the Park Service, aiming at restoring or maintaining natural conditions, are evaluated using data from a giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum)/mixed conifer forest in Kings Canyon National Park, California [see FA 43, 2232]. It is concluded that structural maintenance objectives (those aiming to maintain the vegetation in its current state, or restore it to its presettlement state and maintain it there) are not biologically feasible since this forest community is not in a steady state. Process maintenance objectives, allowing succession to continue in the current vegetation, or after restoration to a presettlement condition, are, therefore, preferred. A new option is also presented, based on a high resolution description of the presettlement forest community and named the reconstruction-simulation approach.Bonnicksen, T. M. and E. C. Stone (1982b). Reconstruction of a presettlement giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest community using the aggreation approach.

The most conspicuous change in the forest community from the presettlement condition (.apprxeq. = 1890) was a general increase in the area of aggregations dominated by pole-size trees and mature trees, and a corresponding decrease in the area of aggregations dominated by sapling- and seedling-size trees. Aggregations dominated by white fir had both the greatest decline in area for sapling and seedling aggregations and the greatest increase in area for large mature, mature, and pole aggregations of any species in the watershed. The area of aggregations dominated by shrubs also declined, with manzanita aggregations showing the largest loss in area for any shrub species. Hardwoods were also a far more important part of the presettlement forest community than they are todayBonnicksen, T. (1994). Reconstruction graphics.Bosch, C. A. (1971).

Boiling and drying of compression-wood blocks induced split extensions at the pit-aperture grooves. The mean S2 fibril angle of 21-25 deg (maximum 32 deg ) was considerably lower than the value (45 deg ) reported in other species. The greater fibril angles of compression wood may be responsible for greater axial shrinkage and lower tangential shrinkage. The low tangential/radial shrinkage ratio is an important physical deviation from normal wood. The magnitude of shrinkage is influenced by the manner of drying, and differs between sapwood and heartwood.Cole, K. (1983). Late Pleistocene vegetation of Kings Canyon, Sierra Nevada, California. Quaternary Research 19: 117-129. 	Seven packrat midden samples make possible a comparison between the modern and late Pleistocene vegetation in Kings Canyon on the western side of the southern Sierra Nevada. One modern sample contains macrofossils and pollen derived from the present-day oak-chaparral vegetation. Macrofossils from the 6 late Pleistocene samples record a mixed coniferous forest dominated by the xerophytic conifers Juniperus occidentalis, Pinus cf. ponderosa and P. monophylla. The pollen spectra of these Pleistocene middens are dominated by Pinus sp., Taxodiaceae-Cupressaceae-Taxaceae (TCT) and Artemisia sp. Mesophytic conifers are represented by low macrofossil concentrations. Sequoiadendron giganteum is presented by a few pollen grains in the full glacial. Edaphic and snow dispersal are the most likely causes of these mixed assemblages. The dominant macrofossils record a more xeric plant community than those that now occur on similar substrates at higher elevations or latitudes in the Sierra Nevada. These assemblages suggest that late Wisconsin climates were cold with mean annual precipitation not necessarily greater than modern values. A model of low summer ablation allowing for the persistence of the glaciers at higher elevations during the late Wisconsin was supported. S. giganteum may have grown at lower elevations along the western side of the range and P. monophylla may have been more widely distributed in cismontane California during the PleistoceneColeman, W. and T.

In T. baccata delayed development of minute axillary buds occurs from these meristems after 1-4 yr on the intact plant.

Seed germination varied among populations, but did not reveal any clear geographic patterns. Cotyledon numbers (of 871 seedlings) varied among populations and geographic areas. Cuttings (from 608 seedlings) rooted at 94%. Isozyme variation was found in every population sample at one or more loci. Little if any recent gene flow is likely to have occurred between the northern and southern populations. Relatively low heterozygosity among embryo samples suggests that inbreeding and/or population substructuring is likely in giant sequoia populations. Relatively higher levels of heterozygosity are found in the southern parts of the range, suggesting different local selective regimes. Early data suggest that the most northern native population (Placer Grove) may be substantially different from the other populationsFins, L. and W. J. Libby (1992).

The temperature that kills 50% of the twig foliage is called the frost-killing-point and is denoted LT50%. The results were compared to damage sustained outdoors by seedlings and support the reliability of the testing methods employed. The experiment included the open-pollinated offspring of 2 trees growing in Hermeskeil, West Germany, and seedling samples of 22 provenances representing the entire natural range of giant sequoia. Significant and substantial differences were found in frost resistance, winter damage and in early height. Frost resistance is correlated with outdoor winter damage and elevation, however not with latitude, longitude nor seedling height.

Open-cone trees showed a significantly higher av. polymorphic index than trees with closed cones. The results are discussed and compared with those of a previous study of 113 vascular plant taxa in which species were classified for 12 life history and ecological traits and 3 measures of variation calculated. The study showed that plants with large ranges, high fecundities, an outcrossing mode of reproduction, wind pollination, a long generation time and from habitats representing later stages of succession had more isozyme variation than species with other characteristics.Hannum, W.

Based on a chronosequence, Abies concolor boles have a decay rate-constant of 0.05 year-1 and a half-life of 14 years. A decay classification system was developed for Abies concolor, Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin, Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf., and Pinus lambertiana Dougl. logs. Dimensions taken from maps of six permanent plots were combined with decay-class information to estimate volume, mass, and projected cover of logs and snags. Total mass ranged from 29 Mg ha-1 in a Pinus jeffreyi forest to 400 Mg ha-1 in a Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) Buchh. dominated stand.

Compared with controls, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization increased biomass more of younger than older seedlings. In young seedlings, species with large seeds responded less to phosphate addition or vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization than smaller seeded species. Vesicular-arbuscular myocorrhizal seedlings with low phosphorus were always larger than noninoculated low phosphorus controls and comparable in size or larger than nonmycorrhizal controls at moderate phosphorus. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal plants produced from 100 to 2000% more biomass than noninoculated plants at low phosphorus, and from equality to 500% at moderate phosphorus. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species did not differ in plant growth enhancement or root colonization at any seedling age or phosphorus fertility examined. Tree species' responsiveness ranged as follows: Thuja plicata > Sequoia sempervirens > Calocedrus decurrens > Sequoiadendron giganteum.

Over the 50 years virgin giant sequoia forest of the saddle and east slope (within Kings Canyon National Park) remains unchanged but has lost the Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus borealis). The mixture of old and second-growth sequioas of Whitaker's Forest, where pines and undergrowth were removed and snags eliminated, is missing the Mountain Quail (Oreotyx pictus), Flammulated Owl (Otus flammeolus), North Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis), Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), and Olive-sided Flycatcher. Though unchanged today, the riparian alders of Eshom Creek on the west slope have lost Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus). Drastic logging by Sequoia National Forest has driven all of the above from the west slope ponderosa pine forest that surrounds Whitaker's Forest. New birds established at Whitaker's Forest by 1986 are the Common Raven (Corvus corax), House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), and Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii). Intrusion of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) has begun within yet affecting two abundant species of vireos. The Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is reduced; the Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) has greatly increased. I attempt to explain avifaunal changes by comparing habitats over the 50-year interval. Disappearance of the flycatcher and thrush from unchanged, prime habitat must be caused by destruction of corresponding forests in Central America, where these birds maintain their winter territoriesMartin, E.

Silvae Genetica 36(2): 65-68. 	Four provenances of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) Buchh.) originating from the counties Fresno, Calaveras, Tulare and from Sequoia National Forest in California [USA]were tested on three sites in the Federal Republic of Germany (Rengsdorf/Rhineland Palatinate; Reinhausen/Lower Saxony; and at Grosshansdorf/Schleswig-Holstein). At age 14 years differences in survival between locations and provenances were ascertained. At the trial in Grosshansdorf survival was influenced particularly by frost damage in a frost pocket and a following infection by Armillaria mellea (Vahl) Karst. In spite of the small number of provenances there were significant differences in height, d.b.h. and diameter at half tree height between provenances and locations. The provenance Tulare which is known from other trials to perform well proved to have inferior growth and survival up to age 14 years. At the trial at Rengsdorf height growth was slightly negatively correlated with the altitude at the seed origin. A prerequisite for establishing stands of giant sequoia at a commercial scale is the choice of frost hard (and well performing) provenances. Such stands might be promising at suited sites in the Federal Republic of GermanyMetcalf, W. (1948). Youthful years of the big tree. Pacific Discovery 1(3): 4-10.Metcalf, W., P. C.

Cultures were initiated on a low-salt medium containing 0.1 mg l-1 l-naphthaleneacetic acid to stimulate meristematic activity. Benzylamino purine (0.01-0.5 mg l-1) inhibited meristematic activity, whereas gibberellic acid (0.01-0.5 mg l-1) had no effect on meristematic development. The mature ortet showed more specific mineral requirements and a lower capacity for cloning than the juvenile ortet. Rooted plants were obtained only from the juvenile clone. There was a marked seasonal effect on meristematic activity, especially for the mature clone, the most active material being obtained during budbreakMonteuuis, O. and M. Gendraud (1987). Nucleotide and nucleic acid status in shoot tips from juvenile and mature clones of Sequoiadendron giganteum during rest and growth phases. Tree Physiology 3(3): 257-263. 	Nucleoside triphosphate and nucleic acid contents of shoot tips of juvenile and mature clones of Sequoiadendron giganteum Buchholz were analyzed during rest and growth phases. In both juvenile and mature clones, shoot growth activity was characterized by significant increases in ATP, non-adenylic nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) and RNA levels. During the rest period, both ATP/NTP and RNA/DNA ratios were significantly higher in the juvenile clone than in the mature clone. However, during the growth phase, only the ATP/NTP ratio was higher in the juvenile than in the mature clone. The results suggest that the physiological differences between shoot tips of juvenile and mature tissues during the rest phase tend to decline as active shoot growth commences. This conclusion is consistent with morphological observations and with the varying organogenetic capacities of in vitro cultures of explants removed from stock plants at different timesMonteuuis, O., M.

Biol. 40(1): 128-137. 	Many phylogenetically ancient plant forms can synthesize chlorophyll in the absence of light at early ontogenetic stages. This ability was studied in the representatives of Gymnospermae, both relict and phylogenetically advanced forms. Using low-temperature fluorometry, 12 [Ginkgo biloba, Podocarpus macrophyllus D., Picea abies Karts., Cedrus deodara Lond., Pinus sylvestris L., Larix sibirica L., Cryptomeria japonica L., Sciadopitys verticillata L., Sequoia sempervivens Lamb., Sequoiadendron giganteum Linde., Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu et Hung, Cercediphyllium manigifum Kai., Zelcova serrata Spach, Arbutus andrachue A. L. de Juss and Callistemon lanceolata A. L. de Juss spp. of Coniferophyta were compared. Representatives of all the families studies (Gingkoaceae, Pinaceae, Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae) are able, at a stage of primary leaves, to accumulate in the dark chlorophyll forms differing in the degree of molecular aggregation. In the relict angiosperms studied this ability was absent. A nonphotochemical pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis is apparently present at the earliest stages of the evolution of Gymnospermae, which might be connected with germination conditions of the latter. Preservation of the ability for chlorophyll synthesis in the darkness at the seedling stage in now living species of Pinaceae and Taxodiaceae might point to a considerable adaptive lability of these plants. Further investigation into the peculiarities of formation of the pigment apparatus of coniferous plants will contribute to elucidation of some plant evolution problemsNorris (1963).

Forest Ecology and Management 2(1): 21-33. 	Fire suppression (100 yr) in a mixed-conifer forest which evolved with frequent natural fires has shifted successional patterns, increased the density of small trees, and produced an unnatural accumulation of ground fuels. Analysis of species composition, vegetation structure and age distribution in each of 4 forest types within the mixed-conifer zone of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, USA, has documented a substantial increase in young, shade tolerant white fir [Abies concolor] in each type. The original dominant species have decreased in relative abundance in most cases. The sequoia type has been most affected by the fire suppression policy. Giant sequoia [Sequoiadendron giganteum] show poor reproduction in the absence of fire. The sequoia type also exhibits the greatest accumulation of ground fuels. The ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa], white fir and mixed forest types also show successional changes as well as significant accumulations of flammable ground fuels following a century of fire exclusion. The management implications of these findings are discussed.Parsons, D.

W. (1973). The relationship between basal fire scars and crown damage in giant sequoia [Sequoiadendron giganteum]. Ecology 54(1): 210-213. 	Describes a study showing that a strong correlation exists between the presence of basal scars in Sequoia gigantea and the occurrence of snag tops (consisting of the dead top of the main stem plus remnants of the uppermost branches) in mature trees. The % of snag-top trees was directly related to the size of the basal scar. Ca. 50% of trees with fire scars > 100 ft2 in area had a snag top. The evidence indicates that the physiological basis of this phenomenon is a response to high water stresses in the uppermost crown of a mature tree. Fire damage at the base of the tree destroys large amounts of active xylem, thereby reducing the rate of water absorption. When water stress exceeds the physiological tolerance limits for the species, the top of the stem is the first part damaged. The critical water potential at the top of mature S. gigantea indicates that trees may survive xylem pressure potentials somewhat lower than -20 bars for short periods at midday without damage. Water potentials lower than this may be a significant limiting factor in determining the upper height limits of these trees.Rundel, P. W. and T. St John (1975).

This paper primarily summarizes the data on nest elevations and dimensions, entrance orientations, nest longevity and re-use, vulnerability of sites to natural enemies, and use of sites by other species. Although all known nests have been natural cavities, some have been little more than overhung ledges on cliffs, while others have been deep, dark caves with nest chambers completely concealed from the outside. Two sites have been cavities in giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum). Contrary to previous assumptions, condors do modify the characteristics of their nest sites significantly and commonly construct substrates of coarse gravel on which to rest their eggs. Many nests have been completely accessible to terrestrial predators, many have been poorly protected from avian predators, and some have had structural flaws leading directly to nesting failure. The use of suboptimal sites has not been clearly related to a scarcity of better quality sitesSouthern-Pacific, C. (1901).

However, significantly lower amounts (70 .mu.g per mg dry wt) were found in Cryptomeria japonica (L.f.) D. Don. This latter species as well as Sciadopitys verticillata, contained little or no prodelphinidin, while the other four species contained a ratio of procyanidin to prodelphinidin up to about 1:5. These data were based on analyses from three trees from each species. In addition, one tree from each species was examined in more detail. The major flavan-3-ol in all cases was (+)-catechin, with only non-detectable or trace amounts of (-)-epicatechin. The triphenolic flavan-3-ol, (+)-gallocatechin, was a minor constituent in all species, except Sciadopitys and Cryptomeria. The (-)-epigallocatechin was detected in Metasequoia, Sequoiadendron and Sequoia. All contained either (-)-epicatechin-(+)-catechin or (+)-catechin-(+)-catechin as the major procyanidin dimer.

Litterfall and decomposition rates. Canadian Journal of Forest Research 18(9): 1127-1135. 	Litterfall was measured for 4 years and leaf litter decomposition rates were studied for 3.6 years in two mixed conifer forests (giant sequoia - fir and fir-pine) in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The giant sequoia - fir forest (GS site) was dominated by giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.)Buchh.), white fir (Abies concolor Lindl. & Gord.), and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.). The fir-pine forest (FP site) was dominated by white fir, sugar pine, and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin). Litterfall, including large woody debris < 15.2 cm in diameter, at the GS site averaged 6364 kg .cntdot. ha-1 .cntdot. year-1 compared with 4355 kg .cntdot. ha-1 .cntdot. year-1 at the FP site. Compared with other temperate coniferous forests, annual variability in litterfall (as computed by the ratio of the annual maximum/minimum litterfall) was extremely high for the GS site (5.8:1) and moderately high for the FP site (3.4:1). In the GS site, leaf litter decomposition after 3.6 years was slowest for giant sequoia (28.2% mass loss), followed by sugar pine (34.3%) and white fir (45.1%). In the FP site, mass loss was slowest for sugar pine (40.0%), followed by white fir (45.1%), while incense cedar showed the greatest mass loss (56.9%) after 3.6 years. High litterfall rates of large woody debris (i.e., 2.5-15.2 cm diameter) and slow rates of leaf litter decomposition in the giant sequoia - fir forest type may result in higher litter accumulation rates than in the fir-pine type. Leaf litter times to 95% decay for the GS and FP sites were 30 and 27 years, respectively, if the initial 0.7-year period (a short period of rapid mass decay) was ignored in the calculation. A mass balance approach for total litterfall (< 15.2 cm diameter) decomposition yielded lower decay constants than did the litterbag study and therefore longer times to 95% decay (57 years of the GS siteand 62 years for the FP site)Stohlgren, T. J. (1988b). Litter dynamics in two Sierran mixed conifer forests. II. Nutrient release in decomposing leaf litter. Canadian Journal of Forest Research 18(9): 1136-1144. 	The factors influencing leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release patterns were investigated for 3.6 years in two mixed conifer forests in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The giant sequoia - fir forest was dominated by giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.)Buchh.), white fir (Abies concolor Lindl. & Gord.), and sugar pine (Pinus labertiana Dougl.). The fir-pine forest was dominated by white fir, sugar pine, and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.)Florin). Initial concentrations of nutrients and percent lignin, cellulose, and acid detergent fiber vary considerably in freshly abscised leaf litter of the studied species. Giant sequoia had the highest concentration of lignin (20.3%) and the lowest concentration of nitrogen (0.52%), while incense cedar had the lowest concentration of lignin (9.6%) and second lowest concentration of nitrogen (0.63%). Long-term (3.6 years) foliage decomposition rates were best correlated with initial lignin/N (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.05), lignin-concentration (r2 = 0.92, p < 0.05), and acid detergent fiber concentration (r2 = 0.80, p < 0.05). Patterns of nutrient release were highly variable. Giant sequoia immobilized N and P, incense cedar immobilized N and to a lesser extent P, while sugar pine immobilized Ca. Strong linear or negative exponential relationship existed between initial concentrations of N, P, K, and Ca and percent original mass remaining of those nutrients after 3.6 years. This suggests efficient retention of these nutrients in the litter layer of these ecosystems. Nitrogen concentrations steadily increase in decomposing leaf litter, effectively reducing the C/N ratios from an initial range of 68-96 to 27-45 after 3.6 yearsStohlgren, T. J. (1990a).

Ant-exclusion experiments and field observations indicated that survival of the abundant Cinara occidentalis Davidson on white fir depends on attendance by Camponotus modoc. More of the predators, Neomysia oblonguttata (Mulsant), Deraeocoris brevis Uhler, Passaloecus cuspidatus F. Smith, Pityophyphantes sp., were found on ant-unattended than on attended aphid colonies. As aphid populations decreased, ant attendance per aphid and number of predators/aphid increased. Attended aphid colonies were more likely to survive to produce oviparae and a lower proportion of alatesTilles, D. A. and D. L. Wood (1986). Foraging behavior of the carpenter ant, Camponotus modoc (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), in a giant sequoia forest.

The average weight of ants collected at colonies of the aphid Cinara occidentalis was significantly less than the average weight of ants collected in the vicinity of the ant nest. These data and additional observations suggest that small ants are more likely to attend aphids and transport solid food than are large ants. Some large ants may specialize in honeydew transport. Mark-and-recapture studies showed that workers of Camponotus modoc returned to the same trunk trails and aphid colonies from which they had previously been removed. When relocated to either the base of the tree or to the nest entrance, some workers demonstrated a capacity to recognize the original aphid colony from among as many as eight other colonies in the same tree.
