<hr width="46%">MEMORANDUM FOR CENTRAL PERSONNEL DATA FILE (CPDF) CONTACTS

 

FROM:     STEVE GOLDSTEIN //s// 12/17/02

             Data Standards Manager

             Office of Workforce Information

 

SUBJECT:  Update to the Instructional Program Data Standard

 

The Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) has issued its year 2000 edition of the Classification of
Instructional Programs (CIP-2000), thus requiring the updating of OPM’s
Instructional Program data standard.  The updated standard will be effective
as of January 1, 2003, for personnel processing and Central Personnel Data
File (CPDF) submission.  To give agencies time to update their records, the
old Instructional Program codes will continue to be valid for CPDF
submission until July 1, 2003, at which time only the updated Instructional
Program codes will be valid.

 

Detailed information about the Update is provided in the attached files
(IP1Overview.PDF, IP2CIP2000.PDF, IP3DataStandard.PDF, IP4DataStandard.TXT,
IP5NewCodes.TXT, and IP6CodeChanges.TXT).  File IP1Overview.PDF provides an
overview of the Update and describes the other files.  To access the files,
open the PDF files using an Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Open the TXT files using
a word processor.  For proper display, use a Courier font.
