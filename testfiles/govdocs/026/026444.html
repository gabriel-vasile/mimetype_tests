<p>Toads have rough, warty skin, hop rather than leap, and possess horizontal pupils.
&nbsp; Skin gland secretions contain toxins which deter predators.&nbsp; Toads have
enlarged parotoid glands on each side of the neck over or behind the tympanic membrane.
&nbsp; Toad species can often be distinguished by differences in skin coloration and
pattern, in the shapes and sizes of parotoid glands and cranial ridges, and in the number
and prominence of warts on the skin.</p>

<p>Toads breed in the spring or summer in the north, and may breed year round triggered by
rains in more southern latitudes.&nbsp; Males congregate at breeding ponds and call to
attract females.&nbsp; Breeding males have dark nuptial pads on their thumbs and inner
fingers, and their throats are typically darker than those of females.&nbsp; In most toad
species, females are larger than males.&nbsp; Eggs are usually laid in strings attached to
vegetation.&nbsp; Eggs hatch into small black tadpoles which metamorphose after several
weeks to a few months. </p>
