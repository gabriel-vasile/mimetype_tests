Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Designation&nbsp;
of Critical Habitat for the Arroyo Toad

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate&nbsp;
critical habitat for the arroyo toad (Bufo californicus) pursuant to&nbsp;
the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A total of&nbsp;
approximately 73,780 hectares (182,360 acres) in Monterey, Santa&nbsp;
Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and&nbsp;
San Diego Counties, California, is designated as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat identifies specific areas that are essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of a listed species and, with respect to areas within&nbsp;
the geographic range occupied by the species, that may require special&nbsp;
management considerations or protection. The primary constituent&nbsp;
elements for the arroyo toad are those habitat components that are&nbsp;
essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, breeding,&nbsp;
growth of larvae (tadpoles) and juveniles, intra-specific&nbsp;
communication, dispersal, migration, genetic exchange, and sheltering.&nbsp;
All areas designated as critical habitat for the arroyo toad contain&nbsp;
one or more of the primary constituent elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not designated critical habitat on lands covered by an&nbsp;
existing, legally operative, incidental take permit for the arroyo toad&nbsp;
under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, except for one area that has&nbsp;
activities not covered by the habitat conservation plan (HCP).&nbsp;
Subsection 4(b)(2) of the Act allows us to exclude from critical&nbsp;
habitat designation areas where the benefits of exclusion outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of designation, provided the exclusion will not result in the&nbsp;
extinction of the species. We believe that the benefits of excluding&nbsp;
HCPs from the critical habitat designation for the arroyo toad will&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of including them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In areas where HCPs have not yet had permits issued, we have&nbsp;
designated critical habitat for lands essential to the survival and&nbsp;
conservation of arroyo toads and that may require special management&nbsp;
considerations or protections.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 of the Act requires us to consider economic and other&nbsp;
relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat.&nbsp;
Section 7 of the Act prohibits destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat by any activity funded, authorized, or carried out by&nbsp;
any Federal agency. We solicited data and comments from the public on&nbsp;
all aspects of the proposal, including data on the economic and other&nbsp;
impacts of designation and our approaches for handling HCPs. We revised&nbsp;
the proposal to incorporate or address new information received during&nbsp;
the comment periods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also correct the list of endangered species to account for a&nbsp;
change in the taxonomy of the arroyo toad.

DATE: This rule becomes effective on March 9, 2001.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following discussion is adapted from the final recovery plan&nbsp;
for the arroyo toad (Service 1999), which is available from the&nbsp;
addresses above. The arroyo toad (Bufo californicus) is one of three&nbsp;
members of the southwestern toad (B. microscaphus) complex, in the&nbsp;
family of true toads, Bufonidae. At the time it was listed, the arroyo&nbsp;
toad was considered a subspecies of the southwestern toad, B.&nbsp;
microscaphus californicus. The taxonomy of the complex has been&nbsp;
examined recently by Gergus (1998). Based on his genetic studies, the&nbsp;
arroyo toad should be considered a separate species, Bufo californicus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arroyo toad is a small (adults: snout-urostyle (body) length 55&nbsp;
to 82 millimeters (mm) (2.2 to 3.2 inches (in.)), dark-spotted toad of&nbsp;
the family Bufonidae, with females larger than males. Adult arroyo&nbsp;
toads have a light-olive green or gray to tan dorsum (back) with dark&nbsp;
spots and warty skin. The venter (underside) is white or buff and&nbsp;
without dark blotches or spots. A light-colored, V-shaped stripe&nbsp;
crosses the head and eyelids, and the anterior portion of the oval&nbsp;
parotoid glands (just behind the eyes) are pale. There is usually a&nbsp;
light area on each side of the sacral (pelvic) hump and in the middle&nbsp;
of the back. The arroyo toad generally does not have a middorsal&nbsp;
stripe, but if one is present, it extends only partway along the back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arroyo toad is found in coastal and desert drainages from&nbsp;
Monterey County, California, south into northwestern Baja California,&nbsp;
Mexico. These systems are inherently quite dynamic, with marked&nbsp;
seasonal and annual fluctuations in climatic regimes, particularly&nbsp;
rainfall. Natural climatic variations as well as other random events,&nbsp;
such as fires and floods, coupled with the species' specialized habitat&nbsp;
requirements, lead to annual fluctuations in arroyo toad populations.&nbsp;
Human alterations of habitat can have unpredictable effects on arroyo&nbsp;
toad populations. As a result of agriculture and urbanization, and the&nbsp;
construction, operation, and maintenance of water storage reservoirs,&nbsp;
flood control structures, roads, and recreational facilities such as&nbsp;
campgrounds and off-highway vehicle parks, many arroyo toad populations&nbsp;
have been reduced in size or extirpated (eliminated) due to extensive&nbsp;
habitat loss from the 1920s into the 1990s. Jennings and Hayes (1994)&nbsp;
believe that the loss of habitat, coupled with habitat modifications&nbsp;
due to the manipulation of water levels in many central and southern&nbsp;
California streams and rivers, as well as predation from introduced&nbsp;
aquatic species and habitat degradation from introduced plant species,&nbsp;
caused arroyo toads to be extirpated from 76 percent of the previously&nbsp;
occupied habitat in California.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the arroyo toad was often confused with the California toad&nbsp;
(Bufo boreas halophilus), which is very common in the same region,&nbsp;
detailed studies of the natural history of the arroyo toad were not&nbsp;
begun until the 1980s and 1990s. The arroyo toad exhibits breeding&nbsp;
habitat specialization that favors shallow pools and open sand and&nbsp;
gravel channels along low-gradient reaches of medium to large-sized&nbsp;
streams (Service 1999). These streams can have either intermittent or&nbsp;
perennial streamflow and typically experience periodic flooding that&nbsp;
scours vegetation and replenishes fine sediments. In at least some&nbsp;
portions of its range, the species also breeds in smaller streams and&nbsp;
canyons where low-gradient breeding sites are more sporadically

[[Page 9415]]

distributed. Populations in smaller drainages are likely to be smaller&nbsp;
and at greater risk of extirpation than those on larger streams and in&nbsp;
larger habitat patches (Service 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arroyo toads also require and spend most of their adult life in&nbsp;
upland habitats. Individual toads have been observed as far as 2&nbsp;
kilometers (km) (1.2 miles (mi)) from the streams where they breed, but&nbsp;
are most commonly found within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of those streams&nbsp;
(Service 1999; Griffin et al. 1999; Dan C. Holland, Camp Pendleton&nbsp;
Amphibian and Reptile Survey, Fallbrook, California, unpublished data;&nbsp;
Holland and Sisk 2000). Arroyo toads typically burrow underground&nbsp;
during periods of inactivity and thus tend to utilize upland habitats&nbsp;
that have sandy, friable (readily crumbled) soils. Although the upland&nbsp;
habitat use patterns of this species are poorly understood, activity&nbsp;
probably is concentrated in the alluvial flats (areas created when&nbsp;
sediments from the stream are deposited) and sandy terraces found in&nbsp;
valley bottoms of currently active drainages (Service 1999, Griffin et&nbsp;
al. 1999, Sweet in litt. 1999, Ramirez 2000, Holland and Sisk 2000).

Habitat Characteristics and Ecological Considerations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate habitat for the arroyo toad is created and maintained&nbsp;
by the fluctuating hydrological, geological, and ecological processes&nbsp;
operating in riparian ecosystems and the adjacent uplands. The&nbsp;
riparian/wash habitats as well as adjacent upland habitats are&nbsp;
essential for this species' survival. Periodic flooding that modifies&nbsp;
stream channels, redistributes channel sediments and alters pool&nbsp;
location and form, coupled with upper terrace stabilization by&nbsp;
vegetation, is required to keep a stream segment suitable for all life&nbsp;
stages of the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, arroyo toads require shallow, slow-moving streams,&nbsp;
and riparian (areas near a source of water) habitats that are disturbed&nbsp;
naturally on a regular basis, primarily by flooding. Periodic flooding&nbsp;
helps maintain areas of open, sparsely vegetated sandy stream channels&nbsp;
and terraces. Throughout their range, arroyo toads are typically found&nbsp;
in medium- to large-sized streams, in stretches where riverbed&nbsp;
gradients are low, there are adjacent alluvial terraces, and surface&nbsp;
waters form shallow pools that persist at least through the early&nbsp;
summer months (e.g., into June). These habitat conditions are most&nbsp;
prevalent in foothill valleys, but also occur in several drainages&nbsp;
along the coastal plain and on the desert side of the Transverse&nbsp;
Ranges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arroyo toads have specialized requirements for breeding habitats.&nbsp;
Breeding, arroyo toads use open sites such as overflow pools, old flood&nbsp;
channels, and shallow pools along streams. Such habitats rarely have&nbsp;
closed canopies over the lower banks of the stream channel due to&nbsp;
regular flood events. Heavily shaded pools are generally unsuitable for&nbsp;
larval and juvenile arroyo toads because of lower water and soil&nbsp;
temperatures and poor algal mat development. Episodic (temporary)&nbsp;
flooding is critical to keep the low stream terraces relatively&nbsp;
vegetation-free and the soils friable enough for juvenile and adult&nbsp;
toads to create burrows. Pools less than 30 centimeters (cm) (12 in.)&nbsp;
deep with clear water, flow rates less than 5 cm per second (0.2 foot&nbsp;
(ft) per second), and bottoms composed of sand or well-sorted fine&nbsp;
gravel are favored by adults for breeding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas that are used by juveniles consist primarily of sand or fine&nbsp;
gravel bars with varying amounts of large gravel or cobble with&nbsp;
adjacent stable sandy terraces and streamside flats. Areas that are&nbsp;
damp and have less than 10 percent vegetation cover provide the best&nbsp;
conditions for juvenile survival and rapid growth (Service 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adjacent alluvial terraces used by subadults and adults for&nbsp;
foraging and burrowing are typically sparsely to moderately vegetated&nbsp;
with brush and trees such as mulefat (Baccharis spp.), California&nbsp;
sycamore (Platanus racemosa), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), coast live&nbsp;
oak (Quercus agrifolia), and willow (Salix spp.). The understory of&nbsp;
stream terraces may consist of scattered short grasses, herbs, and leaf&nbsp;
litter, with patches of bare or disturbed soil, or have no vegetation&nbsp;
at all. Substantial areas of fine sand, into which adult toads burrow,&nbsp;
must be present, but can be interspersed with gravel or cobble&nbsp;
deposits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upland habitats used by arroyo toads during both the breeding and&nbsp;
nonbreeding seasons include alluvial scrub, coastal sage scrub,&nbsp;
chaparral (shrubby plants adapted to dry summers and moist winters),&nbsp;
grassland, and oak woodland. Arroyo toads also have been found in&nbsp;
agricultural fields (Griffin et al. 1999), which probably constitute&nbsp;
sinks (areas where mortality rates are higher than reproduction rates)&nbsp;
over the long term, due to tilling, pesticide and fertilizer&nbsp;
applications, and heavy equipment use (Paul C. Griffin, University of&nbsp;
Montana, Missoula, Montana in litt. 2000). When foraging, subadult and&nbsp;
adult arroyo toads often are found around the driplines of oak trees.&nbsp;
These areas often lack vegetation, yet have appropriate levels of prey.&nbsp;
When active at night, toads often can be observed near ant trails&nbsp;
feeding on passing ants, beetles, and other prey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Males call from the streams during the breeding period, which is&nbsp;
generally from late February to early July, although it can be extended&nbsp;
in some years, depending on weather conditions. Males may remain at or&nbsp;
near the breeding pools for several weeks and are particularly&nbsp;
susceptible to predation at this time. Females apparently move to the&nbsp;
breeding pools in the streams for only short time periods, in order to&nbsp;
soak in the water and to breed (Griffin et al. 1999; Nancy Sandburg,&nbsp;
Santa Barbara, California, pers. comm. 1999). Amplexus (mating embrace&nbsp;
of the female by the male) and egg-laying generally occur at the site&nbsp;
where the male was calling. Female arroyo toads apparently release&nbsp;
their entire clutch of 2,000 to 10,000 eggs as a single breeding effort&nbsp;
and probably are unable to produce a second clutch during the mating&nbsp;
season. If conditions are unsuitable, females may not obtain sufficient&nbsp;
food for egg production and will forgo breeding during that year. The&nbsp;
eggs are laid on substrates of sand, gravel, or cobble generally&nbsp;
located away from vegetation in the shallow margins of the pool. High&nbsp;
water flows can wash the eggs out of pools, breaking up the egg strands&nbsp;
and killing the developing embryos. Silt eroding into the streams from&nbsp;
road crossings, adjacent roads, overgrazing, or mining activities can&nbsp;
cover and suffocate eggs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larvae usually hatch in 4 to 6 days at water temperatures of 12 to&nbsp;
16 degrees Celsius (54 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit). Larvae may take 8 to&nbsp;
14 days to become free-swimming, depending on the water temperature.&nbsp;
They are particularly susceptible to the effects of high water flows&nbsp;
during this time period, and heavy rains or untimely releases of water&nbsp;
from dams can kill thousands of tadpoles very quickly. The larval&nbsp;
period for arroyo toads lasts about 65 to 85 days, depending on water&nbsp;
temperatures. Metamorphosis may occur at any time between April and the&nbsp;
beginning of September, depending on the time of breeding, weather, and&nbsp;
water quality. Peak metamorphosis occurs from the end of June to mid-
July in the northern part of the toad's range and from late April to&nbsp;
mid-May in southern California, although it may be later, particularly&nbsp;
at higher elevations. For several days before metamorphosis, arroyo&nbsp;
toad larvae cease feeding and aggregate in shallow water along the&nbsp;
edges of gravel or sand bars, often under or along stranded algal mats.&nbsp;
The metamorphosing and newly

[[Page 9416]]

metamorphosed toads are extremely susceptible to predation, habitat&nbsp;
disturbance, and activities in the streams during this period (Service&nbsp;
1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juvenile arroyo toads remain in the saturated substrate at the&nbsp;
edges of breeding pools for 1 to 3 weeks after metamorphosis. They are&nbsp;
active during the day and can be exposed on the barren sand because&nbsp;
they are too small to burrow into the substrate. During this period,&nbsp;
many toads are lost due to predation unless they can find some cover,&nbsp;
such as cobble, algal mats, or pieces of debris, under or beside which&nbsp;
to hide. As the toads mature, they move further from the pools onto&nbsp;
sand and gravel bars. Crushing of toads by humans and livestock can be&nbsp;
a substantial source of mortality at this stage (Service 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the toads grow, they begin to dig shallow burrows in fine sand,&nbsp;
and switch to a nocturnal (night-time) activity pattern, when they&nbsp;
forage for ants and beetles. Suitable sandy habitat can be highly&nbsp;
localized resulting in dense concentrations of juvenile toads. If the&nbsp;
substrate is not friable enough, juvenile toads often disperse farther&nbsp;
away from the breeding pool into nearby stands of woody riparian&nbsp;
vegetation. Most toads will move into willows or other vegetation as&nbsp;
they grow, and as the stream dries naturally. Thus, to provide optimal&nbsp;
conditions for arroyo toad survival and recovery, it is necessary to&nbsp;
maintain a patchwork of suitable habitats. This patchwork will be on&nbsp;
several scales, with open stream pools and sand or gravel bars&nbsp;
interspersed with patches of native vegetation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little is known of the seasonal and annual movements or&nbsp;
physiological ecology of adults, but subadults and some adult males&nbsp;
move along streams as much as 0.8 km (0.5 mi) and over 1.0 km (0.6 mi)&nbsp;
in a few cases during a single breeding season (Griffin et al. 1999;&nbsp;
Ramirez 2000). Dispersal movements along the stream channel may be over&nbsp;
8 km (5 mi), as evidenced by finding arroyo toads breeding along upper&nbsp;
Piru Creek in 1999 and 2000 (U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service) 1999,&nbsp;
Maeton Freel, Forest Service, pers. comm. 2000). The area had been&nbsp;
surveyed numerous times in the past without finding the species (Sam&nbsp;
Sweet, University of California, Santa Barbara, pers. comm. 1999,&nbsp;
2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extent of arroyo toad movements away from the stream channel is&nbsp;
influenced by rainfall amounts, availability of surface water, width of&nbsp;
streamside terraces and floodplains, vegetative cover, and topography&nbsp;
(Griffin et al. 1999; Ramirez 2000). In San Diego County, Griffin et&nbsp;
al. (1999) found that, for toads radiotracked for more than 10 days, 14&nbsp;
female adult arroyo toads moved an average maximum distance of 135&nbsp;
meters (m) (443 feet (ft)) and a maximum of more than 300 m (984 ft)&nbsp;
perpendicularly from streams, while 46 males moved an average maximum&nbsp;
of 73 m (240 ft) from the streams. Thirty-three males along coastal&nbsp;
streams with broad floodplains moved an average maximum of 92 m (302&nbsp;
ft) from the streams, while 13 in a narrower canyon moved only 23 m (75&nbsp;
ft) from the streambed (Griffin et al. 1999). Ramirez (2000) recorded a&nbsp;
maximum distance from the stream of 37 m (121 ft) for 12 arroyo toads&nbsp;
in one desert slope stream with a very narrow floodplain, and 200 m&nbsp;
(656 ft) for an undisclosed number of toads in another desert slope&nbsp;
system with a broader floodplain. Those distances probably&nbsp;
underestimate the true range of movement distances due to the limited&nbsp;
numbers and tracking season. The extent to which toads move away from&nbsp;
streams may be partially regulated by climatic conditions; moderate&nbsp;
stable temperatures and high humidity facilitate longer-distance&nbsp;
movements into upland habitats (Service 1999). We do not have enough&nbsp;
data to characterize fully overwintering activities and habitat use in&nbsp;
all of the systems that arroyo toads inhabit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several land use activities may affect the hydrology of arroyo toad&nbsp;
stream habitats and destroy or severely modify the dynamic nature of&nbsp;
the riparian systems upon which arroyo toads depend for reproduction,&nbsp;
development, and survival. Human activities that affect water quality&nbsp;
influence the amount and timing of nonflood flows or frequency and&nbsp;
intensity of floods, affect riparian plant communities, or alter&nbsp;
sedimentation dynamics can reduce or eliminate the suitability of&nbsp;
stream channels for arroyo toad breeding habitat. Degradation or loss&nbsp;
of surrounding riparian and upland habitats reduces and eliminates&nbsp;
foraging and overwintering habitat. The introduction of nonnative plant&nbsp;
and animal species can reduce the quality of all habitats used by&nbsp;
arroyo toads, lead to detrimental levels of competition and predation,&nbsp;
or reduce the availability of toad food. Run-off from roads can&nbsp;
decrease habitat quality for arroyo toads, and roads provide access for&nbsp;
humans, domestic animals, and invasive species that can lead to&nbsp;
additional habitat degradation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effects of such activities and factors may not become apparent&nbsp;
until many years later when the habitat finally becomes sufficiently&nbsp;
degraded that arroyo toads can no longer reproduce and survive.&nbsp;
Combined with the normal climatic fluctuations in the arroyo toad's&nbsp;
range, which can include consecutive years of extremely high or low&nbsp;
rainfall, human impacts can cause temporary or permanent extirpations&nbsp;
of toads from some areas. Human activities that may cause adverse&nbsp;
impacts to arroyo toads include urbanization and agriculture within and&nbsp;
adjacent to riparian habitats, the use of pesticides and herbicides&nbsp;
within or adjacent to arroyo toad habitat, dam building and the&nbsp;
resulting reservoirs, water flow manipulations, sand and gravel mining,&nbsp;
suction dredge mining, road placement across and within stream&nbsp;
terraces, livestock grazing, off-highway vehicle use of roads and&nbsp;
stream channels, the placement of campgrounds and other recreational&nbsp;
facilities in arroyo toad habitat (especially on stream terraces), and&nbsp;
the use of stream channels and terraces for recreational activities.

Previous Federal Actions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We first included the arroyo southwestern toad as a Category 2&nbsp;
candidate species in the September 18, 1985, Notice of Review of&nbsp;
Candidate Species (50 FR 37958). It was included under the same&nbsp;
category in subsequent notices on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), and&nbsp;
November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). We were petitioned to list the arroyo&nbsp;
toad under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16&nbsp;
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), on December 30, 1992, and we published a proposed&nbsp;
rule on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41231). The arroyo toad was listed as&nbsp;
endangered on December 16, 1994 (59 FR 64859). The designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat was determined to be not prudent due to threats of&nbsp;
vandalism and collection. A draft recovery plan for the arroyo&nbsp;
southwestern toad was made available for public comment on May 6, 1998&nbsp;
(63 FR 25062), and we published the final recovery plan in September&nbsp;
1999.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of listing, we concluded that designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the arroyo toad was not prudent due to threats of vandalism&nbsp;
and collection and because such designation would not benefit the&nbsp;
species. We were concerned that critical habitat designation would&nbsp;
likely increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collection, or&nbsp;
other human-induced impacts. We were aware of at least one instance of&nbsp;
the apparent collection of a group of breeding males that had occurred&nbsp;
during the listing process, following the publication of information&nbsp;
regarding an ongoing scientific study. During the development of the&nbsp;
final recovery plan, concern was raised about collecting

[[Page 9417]]

activities on some public lands (Service 1999). However, we have&nbsp;
determined that instances of vandalism have not increased since the&nbsp;
listing of the arroyo toad, and the threats to this species and its&nbsp;
habitat from specific instances of collection and habitat destruction&nbsp;
do not outweigh the broader educational, potential regulatory, and&nbsp;
other possible benefits that designation of critical habitat would&nbsp;
provide for this species. A designation of critical habitat can provide&nbsp;
educational benefits by formally identifying those areas essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of the species. These areas are also identified in the&nbsp;
recovery plans as the focus of our recovery efforts for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 4, 1999, the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity&nbsp;
(Center for Biological Diversity) and Christians Caring for Creation&nbsp;
<b>filed</b> a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against the&nbsp;
Service for failure to designate critical habitat for seven species&nbsp;
including the arroyo southwestern toad (Bufo microscaphus&nbsp;
californicus). On November 5, 1999, the district court dismissed the&nbsp;
plaintiffs' lawsuit pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into by&nbsp;
the parties. Under the settlement agreement, we agreed to submit a&nbsp;
proposed determination of critical habitat for the arroyo toad by June&nbsp;
1, 2000, and to submit the final designation to the Federal Register by&nbsp;
January 5, 2001. By further agreement with the plaintiffs, this final&nbsp;
deadline was to extended to January 19, 2001, to allow us time to&nbsp;
review and incorporate the comments received on the proposed&nbsp;
designation and draft economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 8, 2000, we published a proposed determination for the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad (65 FR 36512). A&nbsp;
total of approximately 193,600 hectares (478,400 acres) was proposed as&nbsp;
critical habitat for the arroyo toad in Monterey, San Luis Obispo,&nbsp;
Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside,&nbsp;
and San Diego Counties, California. The comment period was open until&nbsp;
August 7, 2000. During this 60-day comment period we held two public&nbsp;
hearings (Valencia on June 27 and Temecula on June 29, 2000). On&nbsp;
November 9, 2000, we published a notice (65 FR 67334) announcing the&nbsp;
reopening of the comment period and a notice of availability of the&nbsp;
draft economic analysis on the proposed determination. The comment&nbsp;
period was open an additional 30 days, until December 11, 2000.

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as--(I) the&nbsp;
specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a species, at the&nbsp;
time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those&nbsp;
physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the species and (II) that may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographic area&nbsp;
occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon a determination&nbsp;
that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.&nbsp;
``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and procedures that are&nbsp;
necessary to bring an endangered or a threatened species to the point&nbsp;
at which listing under the Act is no longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
through the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat with regard to actions carried out, funded, or&nbsp;
authorized by a Federal agency. Section 7 also requires consultation on&nbsp;
Federal actions that are likely to result in the destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat. In our regulations at 50 CFR 402.02,&nbsp;
we define destruction or adverse modification as ``. . . the direct or&nbsp;
indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical&nbsp;
habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such&nbsp;
alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely&nbsp;
modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the&nbsp;
basis for determining the habitat to be critical.'' Aside from the&nbsp;
added protection that may be provided under section 7, the Act does not&nbsp;
provide other forms of protection to lands designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat. Because consultation under section 7 of the Act does not apply&nbsp;
to activities on private or other non-Federal lands that do not involve&nbsp;
a Federal nexus, critical habitat designation would not afford any&nbsp;
additional protections under the Act against such activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be included in a critical habitat designation, the habitat must&nbsp;
first be ``essential to the conservation of the species.'' Critical&nbsp;
habitat designations identify, to the extent known using the best&nbsp;
scientific and commercial data available, habitat areas that provide&nbsp;
essential life cycle needs of the species (i.e., areas on which are&nbsp;
found the primary constituent elements, as defined at 50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(b)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 requires that we designate critical habitat at the time&nbsp;
of listing and based on what we know at the time of the designation.&nbsp;
When we designate critical habitat at the time of listing or under&nbsp;
short court-ordered deadlines, we will often not have sufficient&nbsp;
information to identify all areas of critical habitat. We are required,&nbsp;
nevertheless, to make a decision and thus, must base our designations&nbsp;
on what, at the time of designation, we know to be critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the geographic area occupied by the species, we will&nbsp;
designate only areas currently known to be essential. Essential areas&nbsp;
should already have the features and habitat characteristics that are&nbsp;
necessary to sustain the species. We will not speculate about what&nbsp;
areas might be found to be essential if better information became&nbsp;
available, or what areas may become essential over time. If the&nbsp;
information available at the time of designation does not show that an&nbsp;
area provides essential life cycle needs of the species, then the area&nbsp;
should not be included in the critical habitat designation. Within the&nbsp;
geographic area occupied by the species, we will not designate areas&nbsp;
that do not now have the primary constituent elements , as defined at&nbsp;
50 CFR 424.12(b), that provide essential life cycle needs of the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our regulations state that, ``The Secretary shall designate as&nbsp;
critical habitat areas outside the geographic area presently occupied&nbsp;
by the species only when a designation limited to its present range&nbsp;
would be inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species.'' (50&nbsp;
CFR 424.12(e)). Accordingly, when the best available scientific and&nbsp;
commercial data do not demonstrate that the conservation needs of the&nbsp;
species require designation of critical habitat outside of occupied&nbsp;
areas, we will not designate critical habitat in areas outside the&nbsp;
geographic area occupied by the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Policy on Information Standards Under the Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act, published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (Vol.59, p.&nbsp;
34271), provides criteria, establishes procedures, and provides&nbsp;
guidance to ensure that decisions made by the Service represent the&nbsp;
best scientific and commercial data available. It requires Service&nbsp;
biologists, to the extent consistent with the Act and with the use of&nbsp;
the best scientific and commercial data available, to use primary and&nbsp;
original sources of information as the basis for recommendations to&nbsp;
designate critical habitat. When determining which areas are critical&nbsp;
habitat, a primary source of information should be the listing package&nbsp;
for the species. Additional information may be obtained from a recovery&nbsp;
plan, articles in peer-reviewed

[[Page 9418]]

journals, conservation plans developed by States and counties,&nbsp;
scientific status surveys and studies, biological assessments,&nbsp;
unpublished materials, and expert opinion or personal knowledge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitat is often dynamic, and species may move from one area to&nbsp;
another over time. Furthermore, we recognize that designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat may not include all of the habitat areas that may&nbsp;
eventually be determined to be necessary for the recovery of the&nbsp;
species. For these reasons, all should understand that critical habitat&nbsp;
designations do not signal that habitat outside the designation is&nbsp;
unimportant or may not be required for recovery. Areas outside the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation will continue to be subject to&nbsp;
conservation actions that may be implemented under section 7(a)(1), and&nbsp;
to the regulatory protections afforded by the section 7(a)(2) jeopardy&nbsp;
standard and the section 9 take prohibition, as determined on the basis&nbsp;
of the best available information at the time of the action. We&nbsp;
specifically anticipate that federally funded or assisted projects&nbsp;
affecting listed species outside their designated critical habitat&nbsp;
areas may still result in jeopardy findings in some cases. Similarly,&nbsp;
critical habitat designations made on the basis of the best available&nbsp;
information at the time of designation will not control the direction&nbsp;
and substance of future recovery plans, habitat conservation plans, or&nbsp;
other species conservation planning efforts if new information&nbsp;
available to these planning efforts calls for a different outcome.

Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining areas that are essential to conserve the arroyo&nbsp;
toad, we used the best scientific and commercial data available. We&nbsp;
have reviewed the overall approach to the conservation of the arroyo&nbsp;
toad undertaken by the local, state, Tribal, and Federal agencies&nbsp;
operating within the species' range since its listing in 1994, and the&nbsp;
identified steps necessary for recovery outlined in the final Recovery&nbsp;
Plan for the Arroyo Southwestern Toad (Service 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also reviewed available information that pertains to the&nbsp;
habitat requirements of this species, including material received since&nbsp;
completion of the recovery plan. The material included data in reports&nbsp;
submitted during section 7 consultations and by biologists holding&nbsp;
section 10(a)(1)(A) recovery permits; research published in peer-
reviewed articles and presented in academic theses and agency reports;&nbsp;
regional Geographic Information System (GIS) coverages; occupied and&nbsp;
potential habitat maps developed by the Forest Service (Forest Service&nbsp;
2000); habitat evaluation models for the San Diego County Multiple&nbsp;
Species Conservation Program (MSCP), the North San Diego County&nbsp;
Multiple Habitat Conservation Program (MHCP), and the North County&nbsp;
Subarea of the MSCP for Unincorporated San Diego County; and a&nbsp;
predictive habitat suitability map for San Diego County (Barto 1999).&nbsp;
Further, information provided in comments on the proposed designation&nbsp;
and draft economic analysis were evaluated and taken into consideration&nbsp;
in the development of this final designation.

Primary Constituent Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act and regulations at&nbsp;
50 CFR 424.12, in determining which areas to propose as critical&nbsp;
habitat, we are required to base critical habitat determinations on the&nbsp;
best scientific and commercial data available and to consider those&nbsp;
physical and biological features (primary constituent elements) that&nbsp;
are essential to the conservation of the species, and that may require&nbsp;
special management considerations and protection. These include, but&nbsp;
are not limited to: space for individual and population growth and for&nbsp;
normal behavior; food, water, air, light, minerals, or other&nbsp;
nutritional or physiological requirements; cover or shelter; sites for&nbsp;
breeding, reproduction, rearing (or development) of offspring; and&nbsp;
habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of&nbsp;
the historic geographical and ecological distributions of a species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The areas designated as critical habitat are designed to provide&nbsp;
sufficient breeding and upland habitat to maintain self-sustaining&nbsp;
populations and metapopulations of arroyo toads throughout its range,&nbsp;
and provide of those habitat components essential for the conservation&nbsp;
of the species. Due to the complex life history and dispersal&nbsp;
capabilities of the toads, and the dynamic nature of the environment in&nbsp;
which they are found, the critical habitat designations include a range&nbsp;
of stream reaches and associated uplands. The critical habitat units&nbsp;
are configured to provide for dispersal and migration corridors, as&nbsp;
well as allowing room for population expansion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad include rivers or streams with a hydrologic regime that supplies&nbsp;
sufficient flowing water of suitable quality and sufficient quantity&nbsp;
and at the appropriate times to provide space, food, and cover needed&nbsp;
to sustain eggs, tadpoles, metamorphosing juveniles, and adult breeding&nbsp;
toads; low-gradient stream segments (typically less than 4 percent)&nbsp;
with sandy or fine gravel substrates which support the formation of&nbsp;
shallow pools and sparsely vegetated sand and gravel bars for breeding&nbsp;
and rearing of tadpoles and juveniles; a natural flooding regime or one&nbsp;
sufficiently corresponding to a natural regime that will periodically&nbsp;
scour riparian vegetation, rework stream channels and terraces, and&nbsp;
redistribute sands and sediments, such that adequate numbers and sizes&nbsp;
of breeding pools and sufficient terrace habitats with appropriate&nbsp;
vegetation are maintained; upland habitats (particularly alluvial&nbsp;
streamside terraces and adjacent valley bottomlands that include areas&nbsp;
of loose soil and dependable subsurface moisture where toads can burrow&nbsp;
underground and avoid desiccation) of sufficient width and quality to&nbsp;
provide foraging and living areas for subadult and adult arroyo toads;&nbsp;
few or no nonnative species that prey upon or compete with arroyo&nbsp;
toads, or degrade their habitat; stream channels and upland habitats&nbsp;
where manmade barriers do not completely or substantially impede&nbsp;
migration to overwintering sites, dispersal between populations, or&nbsp;
recolonization of areas that contain suitable habitat; and habitats&nbsp;
with limited human-related disturbance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arroyo toads are not distributed uniformly throughout the critical&nbsp;
habitat units. Arroyo toad breeding habitat is patchily distributed&nbsp;
along the stream courses, and the same is true of appropriate upland&nbsp;
habitat. Some areas primarily provide for migration and dispersal&nbsp;
between breeding and foraging habitats or allow for dispersal to&nbsp;
additional breeding pools that will accommodate expanding populations.&nbsp;
Habitat conditions within streams can change rapidly in response to&nbsp;
streamflows and other factors, such as the development and shifting of&nbsp;
sand and gravel bars, and creation and disappearance of pools. Terrace&nbsp;
and upland habitats, although more stable than streambed and riparian&nbsp;
habitats, may change as a result of rainfall, earthquakes, fires, and&nbsp;
other natural events. These factors may cause the habitat suitability&nbsp;
of given areas to vary over time, thus affecting the distribution of&nbsp;
toads.

Criteria Used To Identify Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final recovery plan (Service 1999) for the arroyo toad&nbsp;
identified the specific recovery needs of the species and serves as a&nbsp;
starting point for

[[Page 9419]]

identifying areas essential to the conservation of the toad. Those&nbsp;
drainage basins identified in the final recovery plan as areas&nbsp;
necessary to achieve arroyo toad recovery are generally reflected in&nbsp;
this final critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recovery strategy for the arroyo toad focuses on providing&nbsp;
sufficient breeding and upland habitat to maintain self-sustaining&nbsp;
populations and metapopulations of arroyo toads across the historic&nbsp;
range of the species in California. To recover the arroyo toad to the&nbsp;
point where it can be downlisted or delisted, it is essential to&nbsp;
preserve the species' genetic diversity as well as the variety of&nbsp;
ecological environments in which it has persisted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are designating critical habitat on lands that are considered&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad. Using the recovery&nbsp;
plan for guidance, we determined an area was essential if it had one or&nbsp;
more of the following characteristics: (1) supports a substantial core&nbsp;
population of arroyo toads; (2) supports at least a small toad&nbsp;
population and possesses favorable habitat conditions for population&nbsp;
expansion and persistence; (3) suitable habitat situated in a location&nbsp;
that appears to be crucial for maintaining the viability of a larger&nbsp;
metapopulation; (4) occupied habitat on the periphery of the arroyo&nbsp;
toad's geographic range; and (5) occupied habitat in atypical or&nbsp;
underrepresented ecological environments (e.g., high elevation or&nbsp;
desert-edge populations). These areas have the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements described above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas supporting core populations or that have the potential to&nbsp;
support large populations are essential because they represent the&nbsp;
foundation for continued persistence of the species. Furthermore, some&nbsp;
habitat areas that would not be considered essential if geographically&nbsp;
isolated are in fact essential when situated in locations where they&nbsp;
facilitate continued connectivity between surrounding populations or&nbsp;
play a significant role in maintaining metapopulation viability (e.g.,&nbsp;
by providing additional areas of occupancy that provide resilience to&nbsp;
periodic extirpations of adjacent habitat patches). Populations on the&nbsp;
periphery of the species range or in atypical ecological environments&nbsp;
are important for maintaining the genetic diversity of the species&nbsp;
which could be essential to evolutionary adaptation to changing&nbsp;
climatic and environmental conditions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arroyo toads are found in a variety of ecologically and&nbsp;
geographically distinct areas. In order to preserve this diversity, the&nbsp;
recovery plan identifies three recovery units--Northern, Southern, and&nbsp;
Desert--that reflect distinct ecological and geographic regions within&nbsp;
the range of the species. The recovery units as identified in the final&nbsp;
recovery plan are provided for reference in Table 1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To identify and map areas essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species, we used the characteristics of essential habitat described&nbsp;
above, data on known arroyo toad locations, and criteria in the&nbsp;
recovery plan for reclassification of the species. Spatial data on&nbsp;
stream gradients were used to determine the extent of suitable breeding&nbsp;
habitat in these areas. Stream reaches containing suitable breeding&nbsp;
habitat are often patchily distributed and interspersed with higher&nbsp;
gradient segments. These interspersed high-gradient segments were&nbsp;
included in the mapped essential stream reaches because of their&nbsp;
proximity to suitable breeding habitat and their importance in&nbsp;
facilitating movement between breeding sites.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To delineate essential upland habitat areas, we used a GIS-based&nbsp;
modeling procedure to identify alluvial terraces and valley bottomlands&nbsp;
adjacent to the previously identified essential stream reaches. Lacking&nbsp;
spatially explicit data on geomorphology, elevation above the stream&nbsp;
channel was used as an indicator of the extent of alluvial habitat.&nbsp;
After some experimentation, we determined

[[Page 9420]]

that areas up to 25 m (80 ft) in elevation above the stream channel&nbsp;
were most likely to contain the primary constituent upland habitat&nbsp;
elements that are essential to arroyo toads. In extremely flat areas we&nbsp;
recognized that there is likely a distance from the stream channel&nbsp;
beyond which arroyo toads seldom travel, so we truncated the upland&nbsp;
habitat delineation at a distance of 1.5 km (0.9 mi) if the 25-m&nbsp;
elevation limit had not yet been reached. This distance is based on&nbsp;
reported observations of arroyo toads at least 1.2 km from the upland/
riparian ecotone (Holland and Sisk 2000). As it turned out, the 25-m&nbsp;
elevation limit was reached at distances less than 1.5 km from the&nbsp;
mapped stream channel along more than 99 percent of the stream reaches,&nbsp;
so the distance limit rarely was a factor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This GIS-based modeling technique was effective at capturing&nbsp;
alluvial areas associated with river valleys. Thus, the width of the&nbsp;
upland component of critical habitat varies based on topography. The&nbsp;
habitat widens in broad alluvial valleys and narrows in places where&nbsp;
streams run through constricted canyons or between surrounding hills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boundaries of critical habitat in each drainage are mapped as&nbsp;
contiguous blocks of 250-m-by-250 m cells that conform to a Universal&nbsp;
Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. We evaluated the effectiveness of this&nbsp;
approach by overlaying known arroyo toad locations on these habitat&nbsp;
boundaries and calculating the percent encompassed. More than 95&nbsp;
percent of all known locations fell within the critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries. However, the vast majority of known locations come from&nbsp;
stream surveys done during the breeding season and thus are detections&nbsp;
of toads in breeding habitat. To more rigorously evaluate the critical&nbsp;
habitat model, we assessed its effectiveness at capturing documented&nbsp;
toad locations from the one available study that focused specifically&nbsp;
on surveying toads in upland habitats. Holland and Sisk (2000)&nbsp;
established extensive pitfall trap arrays at discrete distances from&nbsp;
two stream courses and operated these arrays at various periods&nbsp;
throughout the year. They had 466 captures of arroyo toads, 35 (7.5&nbsp;
percent) of which were identified as being in upland areas. Those toads&nbsp;
were captured at distances that ranged from 15 to 1,175 m from the&nbsp;
upland-riparian ecotone (boundary) (Holland and Sisk 2000). For the two&nbsp;
areas sampled in this study, our modeled critical habitat boundaries&nbsp;
encompassed 88 percent of the pitfall trapping stations where arroyo&nbsp;
toads were detected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To identify critical habitat units, we first examined those lands&nbsp;
under Federal jurisdiction. Those lands include areas managed by the&nbsp;
Department of Defense (DOD), the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land&nbsp;
Management (BLM), the Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps), and the&nbsp;
Service. We also considered the existing status of non-Federal and&nbsp;
private lands in designating areas as critical habitat. Section&nbsp;
10(a)(1)(B) of the Act authorizes us to issue permits for the take of&nbsp;
listed species incidental to otherwise lawful activities. An incidental&nbsp;
take permit application must be supported by a habitat conservation&nbsp;
plan (HCP) that identifies conservation measures that the permittee&nbsp;
agrees to implement for the species to minimize and mitigate the&nbsp;
impacts of the requested incidental take. With one exception, non-
Federal public lands and private lands that are covered by an existing&nbsp;
operative HCP and executed implementation agreement (IA) for arroyo&nbsp;
toads under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act are not designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat because the benefits of exclusion outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of inclusion as discussed in section 4(b)(2) of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are including portions of the Soboba, Pala, Rincon, Capitan&nbsp;
Grande, Viejas, and Sycuan Indian Reservations because they all contain&nbsp;
areas of high-quality habitat within units that are essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of arroyo toads. We have coordinated with the respective&nbsp;
Tribes on this designation under the guidance of the President's&nbsp;
memorandum of April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with&nbsp;
Native American Tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951), E.O. 13175, and 512&nbsp;
DM 2, which requires us to coordinate with federally recognized Tribes&nbsp;
on a Government-to-Government basis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In defining critical habitat boundaries, we made an effort to&nbsp;
exclude all developed areas, such as towns, housing developments, and&nbsp;
other lands unlikely to contain primary constituent elements essential&nbsp;
for arroyo toad conservation. Our 250-meter UTM grid minimum mapping&nbsp;
unit was designed to minimize the amount of development along the urban&nbsp;
edge included in our designation. However, this minimum mapping unit&nbsp;
does not exclude all developed areas, such as buildings, aqueducts,&nbsp;
railroads, airports, and other lands unlikely to contain the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to these areas would not&nbsp;
trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect the species and/or&nbsp;
the primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat includes arroyo toad habitat throughout the&nbsp;
species' range in the United States (i.e., Monterey, Santa Barbara,&nbsp;
Ventura, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, and San Diego&nbsp;
Counties, California). Lands designated are under private, local&nbsp;
agency, county, State, Tribal, and Federal ownership. Lands designated&nbsp;
as critical habitat have been divided into 22 Critical Habitat Units. A&nbsp;
brief description of each unit, and reasons why they are essential for&nbsp;
the conservation of the arroyo toad, are presented below. The units are&nbsp;
generally based on geographically distinct river basins. In several&nbsp;
instances, a river basin has been broken into two or more units based&nbsp;
on human or natural landscape features that effectively separate&nbsp;
portions of the basin (e.g., a large reservoir or gorge). Based on&nbsp;
observations recorded since 1985, each of these units is now occupied&nbsp;
by arroyo toads.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennings and Hayes (1994) estimate that arroyo toads have lost 76&nbsp;
percent of their historic habitat. Although the linear measure of&nbsp;
historically occupied streams may not be four times what is currently&nbsp;
occupied, it is clear from museum records and data on extant&nbsp;
populations that the habitats capable of supporting large numbers of&nbsp;
arroyo toads have decreased dramatically in the last 100 years. The&nbsp;
reaches that typically support or historically supported the highest&nbsp;
densities of toads are those in the lower and middle portions of river&nbsp;
basins, typically associated with third order or larger streams. Many&nbsp;
of those reaches have been lost to or degraded by urban development,&nbsp;
intensive agriculture, water diversions, sand and gravel mining&nbsp;
operations, and reservoirs. For these reasons, we believe all of the&nbsp;
areas we are designating may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection.

Northern Recovery Unit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following seven critical habitat units are located in the&nbsp;
Northern Recovery Unit for the arroyo toad, as discussed in the final&nbsp;
recovery plan. Most of the lands are Federally owned, and management&nbsp;
needs are being addressed through the section 7 consultation process&nbsp;
and the development of management plans and conservation strategies.&nbsp;
Because the remaining toad populations have been reduced in size, and&nbsp;
the habitat fragmented by road construction, dams, agriculture, and&nbsp;
urbanization, it is essential to protect them to reduce further loss of&nbsp;
genetic diversity and safeguard against the loss of any one population&nbsp;
due to random natural or human-caused events.

Unit 1: San Antonio River, Monterey County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 1 consists of the San Antonio River and adjacent uplands, from&nbsp;
about 3 km (2 mi) upstream of the confluence with Mission Creek&nbsp;
downstream to San Antonio Reservoir, a distance of about 27 km (17 mi),&nbsp;
and includes portions of Mission Creek and other tributaries. The unit&nbsp;
encompasses approximately 2,920 ha (7,220 ac), more than 99 percent of&nbsp;
which is on the Fort Hunter Liggett Military Reservation. This is the&nbsp;
northernmost known population of arroyo toads and is approximately 160&nbsp;
km (100 mi) north of the nearest documented extant population. The&nbsp;
protection and recovery of this area are essential to maintain the&nbsp;
complete genetic variability of the species and the full range of&nbsp;
ecological settings within which it is found.

Unit 2: Sisquoc River, Santa Barbara County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2 consists of 44 km (27 mi) of the Sisquoc River and adjacent&nbsp;
uplands, from Sycamore Campground downstream to just below the&nbsp;
confluence with La Brea Creek. The unit encompasses approximately 3,385&nbsp;
ha (8,360 ac), of which 56 percent is private land and 43 percent is&nbsp;
within the Los Padres National Forest. Upper stretches of the river are&nbsp;
within the National Forest and mostly within the San Rafael Wilderness&nbsp;
Area. Below the National Forest boundary, the river and adjacent&nbsp;
uplands are on private lands. This long, unregulated stream is occupied&nbsp;
arroyo toad habitat and is one of the few remaining major rivers in&nbsp;
southern California with a natural flow regime. This area is essential&nbsp;
to maintaining genetic diversity of the species. The protection of this&nbsp;
population is essential as it is a core population. Arroyo toads from&nbsp;
this population may be a suitable source for the reestablishment of&nbsp;
populations outside critical habitat on the upper Salinas River, if&nbsp;
appropriate habitat can be identified and protected.

Unit 3: Upper Santa Ynez River Basin, Santa Barbara County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 3 is located upstream of Gibraltar Reservoir and incorporates&nbsp;
portions of the upper Santa Ynez River, Indian Creek, Mono Creek, and&nbsp;
adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately 2,395 ha (5,910&nbsp;
ac) within the boundaries of Los Padres National Forest; 81 percent is&nbsp;
on National Forest lands and 19 percent is on private inholdings.&nbsp;
Designated portions of the upper Santa Ynez River extend 16 km (10 mi)&nbsp;
from Jameson Reservoir downstream to Gibraltar Reservoir. Indian Creek&nbsp;
is designated from the Buckthorn Creek confluence down to the Mono&nbsp;
Debris Dam, a distance of 8 km (5 mi). Mono Creek and associated&nbsp;
uplands are designated for 12 km (7.5 mi) from the first unnamed stream&nbsp;
below The Narrows to its confluence with the Santa Ynez River. This&nbsp;
area is essential to maintaining genetic diversity of the species. A&nbsp;
substantial and well-studied arroyo toad population occurs in this area&nbsp;
(Sweet 1992, 1993). It is likely the remnant of a much larger&nbsp;
population that historically extended downstream below what is now Lake&nbsp;
Cachuma and upstream into the area occupied by Jameson Reservoir. This&nbsp;
area has favorable habitat conditions for population expansion and&nbsp;
persistence; with the reduction of threats through management, this&nbsp;
area should support a larger arroyo toad population.

Unit 4: Sespe Creek, Ventura County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 4 includes 35 km (22 mi) of Sespe Creek and adjacent uplands,&nbsp;
from the lower end of Sespe Gorge (elevation approximately 1,075 m&nbsp;
(3,530 ft)) downstream to the confluence with Alder Creek. The unit&nbsp;
encompasses approximately 2,340 ha (5,800 ac), of which 94 percent is&nbsp;
on the Los Padres National Forest and the remainder is in private&nbsp;
inholdings. A substantial arroyo toad population occurs in this unit&nbsp;
(Service 1999) along an undammed stream in a watershed that is&nbsp;
predominately National Forest land. This area is essential to&nbsp;
maintaining genetic diversity of the species. It is a core population&nbsp;
that can be expanded with appropriate management. In all likelihood,&nbsp;
arroyo toad populations in units 4, 5, and 6 historically were part of&nbsp;
a large Santa Clara River Basin metapopulation. Ecologically, these&nbsp;
units provided a link between the more coastal populations on the&nbsp;
Sisquoc and Santa Ynez rivers, and populations in the Desert Recovery&nbsp;
Unit. Substantial barriers to toad movement now exist between these&nbsp;
units, including dams, agriculture, and urban development.

Unit 5: Piru Creek, Ventura and Los Angeles counties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 5 includes Piru Creek and adjacent uplands from the confluence&nbsp;
with Lockwood Creek downstream to Pyramid Reservoir (Subunit 5a), and&nbsp;
from Pyramid Dam downstream to Lake Piru (Subunit 5b). Subunit 5b also&nbsp;
includes Agua Blanca Creek from Devil's Gateway downstream to the&nbsp;
confluence with Piru Creek. The unit

[[Page 9422]]

encompasses approximately 2,975 ha (7,345 ac), 92 percent of which is&nbsp;
within the Los Padres and Angeles National Forests, with the remaining&nbsp;
on private inholdings. A substantial arroyo toad population occurs in&nbsp;
this unit (Service 1999), although much of the historical arroyo toad&nbsp;
habitat in the area is now inundated by the two reservoirs, this&nbsp;
population should expand and become more stable, with appropriate&nbsp;
management. Protection and recovery of this population is essential to&nbsp;
maintain the range of ecological settings from the coast to the desert.

Unit 6: Upper Santa Clara River Basin, Los Angeles County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 6 includes portions of Castaic and San Francisquito Creeks and&nbsp;
adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately 3,360 ha (8,305&nbsp;
ac), of which 68 percent is private land and 30 percent is within the&nbsp;
Angeles National Forest. Subunit 6a includes Castaic Creek from Bear&nbsp;
Canyon downstream to Castaic Lake and Fish Creek from Cienaga Spring to&nbsp;
the confluence with Castaic Creek. Subunit 6b includes Castaic Creek&nbsp;
below Castaic Lake to the confluence with the Santa Clara River.&nbsp;
Subunit 6c includes San Francisquito Creek from Bee Canyon to the&nbsp;
southern end of section 34 in township 5 N, range 16 W. Arroyo toads&nbsp;
are found on Castaic Creek both above and below the reservoir, and&nbsp;
recent surveys have found evidence of the species on San Francisquito&nbsp;
Creek. The arroyo toad population on Castaic has expanded in recent&nbsp;
years with changes in management, and San Francisquito Creek offers an&nbsp;
excellent opportunity for further expansion. With appropriate&nbsp;
management of nonnative plants and animals and habitat rehabilitation,&nbsp;
the stability of the Upper Santa Clara River basin arroyo toad&nbsp;
population should increase substantially. The Santa Clara River, as&nbsp;
managed under the Natural River Management Plan (Valencia Company 1998)&nbsp;
and associated conservation easements, is essential because it serves&nbsp;
as a dispersal corridor for arroyo toads between Castaic Creek and San&nbsp;
Francisquito Creek. This is the easternmost population in the Northern&nbsp;
Recovery Unit, and as such provides the final link in the range of&nbsp;
ecological settings for this recovery unit.

Unit 7: Upper Los Angeles River Basin, Los Angeles County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 7 includes portions of Big Tujunga, Mill, Alder, and Arroyo&nbsp;
Seco creeks, and adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately&nbsp;
3,225 ha (7,970 ac), of which 62 percent is within the Angeles National&nbsp;
Forest and 38 percent is private land. Subunit 7a includes 19 km (11.8&nbsp;
mi) of Big Tujunga Creek from below Big Tujunga Dam downstream to&nbsp;
Hansen Lake. Subunit 7b encompasses: (1) approximately 13 km (8 mi) of&nbsp;
upper Big Tujunga Creek from immediately above Big Tujunga Reservoir&nbsp;
upstream to 2 km (1.2 mi) above the confluence with Alder Creek, (2)&nbsp;
almost 6 km (3.7 mi) of Mill Creek from the Monte Cristo Creek&nbsp;
confluence downstream to Big Tujunga Creek, and (3) 3 km (1.9 mi) of&nbsp;
Alder Creek from the Mule Fork confluence downstream to Big Tujunga&nbsp;
Creek. Subunit 7c includes 9.5 km (6 mi) Arroyo Seco Creek from the&nbsp;
Long Canyon confluence downstream to the upper end of Devil's Gate&nbsp;
Reservoir.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arroyo toads have recently been documented (in the last 5 years) in&nbsp;
each of these drainages and, collectively, they represent the only&nbsp;
significant known population remaining in the coastal foothills of the&nbsp;
San Gabriel Mountains. This unit is essential primarily because it is&nbsp;
occupied and contains favorable habitat conditions for major population&nbsp;
increases, particularly if the timing of water releases from Big&nbsp;
Tujunga Dam can be adjusted to restore the seasonal habitat conditions&nbsp;
necessary for successful arroyo toad breeding. In addition, populations&nbsp;
in Alder, Mill, and Arroyo Seco creeks extend into high-elevation&nbsp;
environments that are atypical for the arroyo toad and may be important&nbsp;
to maintaining genetic diversity.

Southern Recovery Unit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following 12 critical habitat units are located in the Southern&nbsp;
Recovery Unit for the arroyo toad, as discussed in the final recovery&nbsp;
plan. Arroyo toads probably occurred in and along the coastal plain&nbsp;
portions of all the streams in this unit, but are now found on the&nbsp;
coastal plain only in units 8, 10, 11, and 12.

Unit 8: Santiago Creek, Orange County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 8 is located just above Irvine Lake where Black Star, Baker,&nbsp;
and Silverado creeks join Santiago Creek. The unit encompasses&nbsp;
approximately 500 ha (1,235 ac), 99 percent of which is private land;&nbsp;
the remainder is within the Cleveland National Forest. A 3 km (1.9 mi)&nbsp;
stretch of Black Star Creek and associated uplands are designated from&nbsp;
near the southwest corner of Section 30 (T4S, R7W) downstream to&nbsp;
Santiago Creek. A 3.5 km (2.2 mi) stretch of lower Baker Canyon is also&nbsp;
included, as is approximately 1 km of Santiago Creek. This unit is&nbsp;
predominantly within the North Ranch Policy Plan Area within the Orange&nbsp;
County Central-Coastal NCCP/HCP. As discussed in more detail below,&nbsp;
there is not yet an approved Implementing Agreement or section 10&nbsp;
(a)(1)(B) permit for the take of arroyo toads in the North Ranch Policy&nbsp;
Plan Area, so we are including it in this final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. As an artifact of the mapping unit size used to designate&nbsp;
critical habitat for the arroyo toad within the North Ranch Policy Plan&nbsp;
area, a small portion of the Orange County Central-Coastal NCCP/HCP&nbsp;
where take of the arroyo toad has been authorized is within the&nbsp;
boundaries of this critical habitat unit. However, due to the&nbsp;
conservation assurances and take authorization provided for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad in this portion of the critical habitat unit, we hereby exclude it&nbsp;
from designation as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the current status of arroyo toads in this unit is poorly&nbsp;
known, they were observed in lower Baker Canyon in 1985 (Robert Fisher,&nbsp;
USGS, pers. comm. 1999). Surveys performed along Santiago Creek in 1997&nbsp;
failed to detect arroyo toads (Harmsworth Associates 1998), and&nbsp;
reportedly no arroyo toads were detected during year 2000 surveys of&nbsp;
Irvine Company land within this unit (Adrian Wolf, pers. comm. 2000).&nbsp;
However, high-quality habitat still exists in this area (e.g., Baker&nbsp;
Canyon) that likely was not covered in recent survey efforts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 8 is considered essential because habitat conditions are&nbsp;
favorable for population expansion and long-term persistence.&nbsp;
Maintaining a population in this unit should also enhance the viability&nbsp;
of the larger arroyo toad metapopulation that extends across the lower&nbsp;
slopes of the Santa Ana Mountains from Santiago Creek to San Mateo&nbsp;
Creek (crossing into Units 10 and 11). We think there are opportunities&nbsp;
for movement of individuals between occupied drainages in this area,&nbsp;
which would positively influence populations in each drainage.

Unit 9: San Jacinto River and Bautista Creek, Riverside County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 9 includes portions of the San Jacinto River, Indian Creek,&nbsp;
Bautista Creek, and adjacent uplands, east of the town of Hemet. The&nbsp;
unit encompasses approximately 1,710 ha (4,220 ac), of which 60 percent&nbsp;
is private land, 22 percent is within the San Bernardino National&nbsp;
Forest, 9 percent is within the Soboba Indian Reservation, and the&nbsp;
remaining 9 percent is on other Federal or State owned lands. Subunit&nbsp;
9a covers 11 km (6.8 mi) of the San Jacinto River from the Sand Canyon&nbsp;
confluence downstream to just below the confluence with Indian Creek&nbsp;
and also includes the lower 1 km (0.6 mi) of

[[Page 9423]]

Indian Creek. Subunit 9b covers 11 km (6.8 mi) of Bautista Creek from&nbsp;
near the middle of section 20 (T6S, R2E) downstream to near the middle&nbsp;
of section 27 (T5S, R1E), where the stream enters a debris basin. In&nbsp;
the proposal, we stated that while the current status of arroyo toads&nbsp;
in this unit is poorly known, there are historic records from the 1970s&nbsp;
and high quality habitat still exists in the area. Surveys conducted in&nbsp;
the summer of 2000 confirmed the existence of arroyo toad populations&nbsp;
on Bautista Creek (Lisa Lyren, USGS, in litt. 2000) and the San Jacinto&nbsp;
River (Brock Ortega, Dudek &amp; Associates, pers. comm. 2000) within the&nbsp;
San Bernardino National Forest. These populations likely extend&nbsp;
downstream onto private and tribal lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 155 ha (390 ac) of the Soboba Indian Reservation are&nbsp;
included in this unit. High quality arroyo toad habitat exists within&nbsp;
the reservation along lower Indian Creek to its confluence with the San&nbsp;
Jacinto River. It is important to maintaining the integrity of the&nbsp;
unit. Unit 9 is essential for arroyo toad conservation because it is&nbsp;
occupied habitat with favorable conditions for population persistence&nbsp;
in an area that is on the southeastern periphery of the species range.&nbsp;
Decidedly isolated from other known populations, this is a substantial&nbsp;
patch of suitable habitat which supports a population that is important&nbsp;
for genetic diversity and has a high likelyhood of persistence.

Unit 10: San Juan and Trabuco Creeks, Orange and Riverside counties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 10 includes portions of San Juan Creek, Bell Canyon, Trabuco&nbsp;
Creek, and adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately 3,745&nbsp;
ha (9,270 ac), of which 56 percent is private land, 29 percent is&nbsp;
Orange County park land (Caspers Wilderness Park and O'Neill Regional&nbsp;
Park), and 15 percent is on the Cleveland National Forest. Subunit 10a&nbsp;
covers approximately 30 km (18.6 mi) of San Juan Creek from the bottom&nbsp;
of Decker Canyon downstream to Interstate 5 and includes about 4 km&nbsp;
(2.5 mi) of Bell Canyon from just below Crow Canyon downstream to the&nbsp;
confluence with San Juan Creek. Subunit 10b covers approximately 8 km&nbsp;
(5 mi) of Trabuco Creek from Falls Canyon downstream to the lower end&nbsp;
of O'Neill County Park.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Juan and Bell creeks are essential for conservation of the&nbsp;
arroyo toad because they support a large core population, which is&nbsp;
concentrated within Caspers Wilderness Park and private lands&nbsp;
downstream (P. Bloom, in litt.). The designated stretch of Trabuco&nbsp;
Creek is considered essential because it is currently occupied by&nbsp;
arroyo toads (D. Holland, pers. comm.) and conditions there are&nbsp;
favorable for population persistence. A population in this area should&nbsp;
also help maintain connectivity between toads in Santiago Creek to the&nbsp;
north and Bell Canyon to the south.

Unit 11: San Mateo Basin, San Diego and Orange counties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 11 includes portions of San Mateo, Christianitos, Talega,&nbsp;
Gabino, and La Paz creeks, and adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses&nbsp;
approximately 1,820 ha (4,495 ac), of which 54 percent is within&nbsp;
portions of the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base that are leased to&nbsp;
outside parties for other land uses (i.e. San Onofre State Park and&nbsp;
agricultural lands) and 43 percent is on private land. Portions of Camp&nbsp;
Pendleton outside of the leased lands are excluded. Two disjunct&nbsp;
sections of San Mateo Creek are included: Subunit 11b covers&nbsp;
approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) within the Cleveland National Forest near&nbsp;
Devils Canyon, and subunit 11a extends about 5 km (3.1 mi) from the&nbsp;
Christianitos Creek confluence downstream to just below Interstate 5.&nbsp;
Portions of Christianitos Creek are designated from just above Gabino&nbsp;
Creek downstream to the confluence with San Mateo Creek. Approximately&nbsp;
5 km (3.1 mi) of Gabino Creek upstream from its confluence with&nbsp;
Christianitos Creek are designated, including about 1 km (0.6 mi) of La&nbsp;
Paz Creek. The unit also includes approximately 7 km (4.4 mi) of Talega&nbsp;
Creek upstream from its confluence with Christianitos Creek and beyond&nbsp;
the boundaries of Camp Pendleton.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Mateo and Christianitos creeks support large core populations&nbsp;
(Holland and Goodman 1998) and are essential to conservation of the&nbsp;
species. An unusual and potentially important aspect of this unit is&nbsp;
its close proximity to the coast. Historically, there were probably&nbsp;
many near-coast populations, but few remain due to extensive&nbsp;
urbanization and river channelization. Distinctive climatic conditions&nbsp;
near the coast may provide different selective pressures on toads in&nbsp;
this area, potentially favoring specific genetic characteristics.

Unit 12: Lower Santa Margarita River, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 12 includes approximately 20 km (12.4 mi) of the Santa&nbsp;
Margarita River and adjacent uplands, from the lower end of Temecula&nbsp;
Canyon to the boundary of Camp Pendleton (Subunit 12b) and almost 4 km&nbsp;
of De Luz Creek from the town of De Luz to the boundary of Camp&nbsp;
Pendleton (Subunit 12A). The unit encompasses approximately 1245 ha&nbsp;
(3075 ac), of which 30 percent is within the Fallbrook Naval Weapons&nbsp;
Station and 70 percent is on private land. Land within the Camp&nbsp;
Pendleton Marine Corps Base is excluded from this unit (see Discussion&nbsp;
in Exclusion Under Section 4(b)(2)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent surveys of the Santa Margarita River and De Luz Creek&nbsp;
immediately downstream of this unit have documented what is probably&nbsp;
the largest known population of arroyo toads (Holland and Goodman&nbsp;
1998). Portions of these drainages within this unit are also occupied&nbsp;
and considered essential because they supplement and adjoin the large&nbsp;
population on Camp Pendleton and potentially provide connectivity to&nbsp;
populations in the upper Santa Margarita River basin.

Unit 13: Upper Santa Margarita River Basin, Riverside and San Diego&nbsp;
counties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 13 is located above Vail Lake and includes portions of&nbsp;
Temecula Creek, Wilson Creek, Arroyo Seco Creek, and adjacent uplands.&nbsp;
The unit encompasses approximately 4,695 ha (11,610 ac), of which 89&nbsp;
percent is private land and 10 percent is within the Cleveland National&nbsp;
Forest. Approximately 25 km (15.5 mi) of Temecula Creek are designated&nbsp;
from Dodge Valley downstream to Vail Lake. The unit also includes 6 km&nbsp;
(3.7 mi) of Wilson Creek from Lancaster Valley down to Vail Lake and 11&nbsp;
km (6.8 mi) of Arroyo Seco Creek from Crosley Homestead down to Vail&nbsp;
Lake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The broad, flat alluvial valleys found in this unit contain high-
quality habitat for arroyo toads. The unit is essential because there&nbsp;
are documented occurrences in Temecula, Wilson, and Arroyo Seco creeks,&nbsp;
and habitat conditions are favorable for population expansion and long-
term persistence.

Unit 14: Lower and Middle San Luis Rey River Basin, San Diego&nbsp;
County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 14 includes portions of the San Luis Rey River below Lake&nbsp;
Henshaw and adjacent uplands, and includes sections of Pala and Keys&nbsp;
creeks. The unit encompasses approximately 7,470 ha (18,455 ac), of&nbsp;
which 79 percent is private land and 18 percent is Tribal land.&nbsp;
Approximately 48 km (30 mi) of the San Luis Rey River are designated&nbsp;
from the western edge of the La Jolla Indian Reservation downstream to&nbsp;
the confluence with Guajome Creek near the city of Oceanside. It also&nbsp;
includes approximately 5.5 km (3.4 mi) of Pala Creek and 2.7 km (1.7&nbsp;
mi) of Keys Creek

[[Page 9424]]

upstream from the confluence with the San Luis Rey River.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This long, low-elevation (all below 305 m (1,000 ft) in elevation)&nbsp;
unit, situated in a broad, flat valley, is essential to arroyo toad&nbsp;
conservation because it supports a large core population that, provided&nbsp;
threat factors can be addressed, is capable of long-term persistence.&nbsp;
Some of the best arroyo toad habitat in this unit occurs within the&nbsp;
Pala and Rincon Indian Reservations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The San Luis Rey River provides important high quality habitat for&nbsp;
the arroyo toad. However, intensive urbanization and agriculture near&nbsp;
the coast, and dams and water diversions in the upper end, have reduced&nbsp;
habitat quality in the upper and lower portions of this unit.&nbsp;
Approximately 18 percent of the identified remaining suitable habitat&nbsp;
along the San Luis Rey is on Tribal land. The Pala and Rincon&nbsp;
Reservations support broad alluvial floodplains that contain high&nbsp;
quality habitat and recent surveys have documented a substantial arroyo&nbsp;
toad concentration on both reservations. If habitats on these&nbsp;
reservations are lost, the remaining population would be highly&nbsp;
fragmented and vulnerable to extirpation.

Unit 15: Upper San Luis Rey Basin, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 15 includes the upper San Luis Rey River above Lake Henshaw,&nbsp;
two of its headwater tributaries, and adjacent uplands. The unit&nbsp;
encompasses approximately 4,525 ha (11,180 ac), of which 80 percent is&nbsp;
private land and 20 percent is within the Cleveland National Forest.&nbsp;
This unit consists of two subunits. Subunit 15a covers almost 14 km&nbsp;
(8.7 mi) of the upper San Luis Rey River from the Indian Flats area&nbsp;
downstream to the upper end of Lake Henshaw and includes about 12.5 km&nbsp;
(7.8 mi) of Agua Caliente Creek from the western edge of section 13&nbsp;
(T10S, R3E) to the confluence with the San Luis Rey. Subunit 15b&nbsp;
includes approximately 2.5 km (1.6 mi) of the West Fork of the San Luis&nbsp;
Rey River where it runs through Barker Valley. Arroyo toads occur in&nbsp;
each of these drainages, with the largest concentration found along&nbsp;
Agua Caliente Creek.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is essential because it contains a unique assemblage of&nbsp;
several small, disjunct, high-elevation populations and one large, core&nbsp;
population (on Agua Caliente Creek) in an area where in-stream and/or&nbsp;
overland dispersal between populations is probably still possible.

Unit 16: Santa Ysabel Creek, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 16 includes portions of Santa Ysabel Creek and adjacent&nbsp;
uplands, and includes portions of Santa Maria Creek, Guejito Creek, and&nbsp;
Temescal Creek (Pamo Valley). The unit encompasses approximately 4,670&nbsp;
ha (11,545 ac), of which 87 percent is private land and 11 percent is&nbsp;
within the Cleveland National Forest. The unit consists of three&nbsp;
subunits. Subunit 16a includes approximately 13 km (8 mi) of Santa&nbsp;
Ysabel Creek and adjacent uplands from Sutherland Reservoir downstream&nbsp;
to the western boundary of the Cleveland National Forest near Boden&nbsp;
Canyon (which is the eastern boundary of the San Diego MSCP area).&nbsp;
Subunit 16a also includes approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) of Temescal Creek&nbsp;
from the northern edge of Pamo Valley to the confluence with Santa&nbsp;
Ysabel Creek. Subunit 16b includes approximately 12 km (7.5 mi) of&nbsp;
Guejito Creek from the 610 m (2,000 ft) elevation contour downstream to&nbsp;
the San Diego MSCP boundary near San Pasqual Valley. Subunit 16c covers&nbsp;
approximately 10 km (6 mi) of Santa Maria Creek from the west side of&nbsp;
Ramona to the San Diego MSCP boundary near San Pasqual Valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the drainages included in this unit are occupied by arroyo&nbsp;
toads, and a large population exists along Temescal and Santa Ysabel&nbsp;
creeks within Pamo Valley. This unit is essential to arroyo toad&nbsp;
conservation because it supports a large core population and contains&nbsp;
several additional populations that can remain viable and&nbsp;
interconnected. This unit also provides an important linkage and&nbsp;
genetic interchange with a core arroyo toad population in San Pasqual&nbsp;
Valley, within the San Diego MSCP area.

Unit 17: San Diego River/San Vicente Creek, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 17 includes portions of the San Diego River and San Vicente&nbsp;
Creek and adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately 1,595 ha&nbsp;
(3,935 ac), of which 75 percent is private land, 17 percent is within&nbsp;
the Cleveland National Forest, and 6 percent is Tribal land. The unit&nbsp;
is broken into four subunits--three disjunct sections of the San Diego&nbsp;
River and one section of San Vicente Creek. Subunit 17a includes&nbsp;
approximately 8 km (5 mi) of the San Diego River from Ritchie Creek&nbsp;
downstream to the upper edge of El Capitan Reservoir and approximately&nbsp;
1 km (0.6 mi) of lower Cedar Creek. Subunit 17b includes 1.5 km (0.9&nbsp;
mi) of the San Diego River from El Capitan Reservoir to El Monte County&nbsp;
Park. Subunit 17c covers almost 7 km (4.3 mi) of the San Diego River&nbsp;
from approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) below El Monte County Park downstream&nbsp;
to the confluence with San Vicente Creek. Subunit 17d includes 3.9 km&nbsp;
(2.4 mi) of San Vicente Creek from the west side of San Diego Country&nbsp;
Estates downstream to where the creek crosses Wildcat Canyon Road (the&nbsp;
MSCP area boundary).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper San Diego River and San Vicente Creek are both occupied&nbsp;
by arroyo toads. This unit is essential to arroyo toad conservation&nbsp;
because it encompasses several significant populations and includes&nbsp;
suitable habitat for population expansion, which increases the&nbsp;
probability of long-term persistence. It also provides an important&nbsp;
linkage to populations occurring within the San Diego MSCP area.&nbsp;
Approximately 100 ha (245 ac) of the Capitan Grande Indian Reservation&nbsp;
at the upper end of El Capitan Reservoir are included in this unit.&nbsp;
High quality riparian and alluvial terrace habitats occur within the&nbsp;
Reservation and they are important portions of the unit.

Unit 18: Sweetwater River Basin, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 18 includes portions of the Sweetwater River, Peterson Canyon,&nbsp;
Viejas Creek, and adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately&nbsp;
5,065 ha (12,540 ac), of which 55 percent is private land, 22 percent&nbsp;
is on California State Park land, 13 percent is within the Cleveland&nbsp;
National Forest, and 7 percent is on the San Diego National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge. The unit is broken into four subunits--three disjunct sections&nbsp;
of the Sweetwater River and one section of Viejas Creek. Subunit 18a&nbsp;
covers approximately 32 km (20 mi) of the Sweetwater River from the top&nbsp;
of Upper Green Valley in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park downstream to the&nbsp;
San Diego MSCP area boundary. Subunit 18b includes approximately 1.2 km&nbsp;
(0.7 mi) of the Sweetwater River between the MSCP boundary and Loveland&nbsp;
Reservoir and 2.4 km (1.5 mi) of Peterson Canyon from just east of the&nbsp;
Taylor Creek confluence downstream to the top of Loveland Reservoir.&nbsp;
Subunit 18c encompasses approximately 26 km (16 mi) of the Sweetwater&nbsp;
River, within the MSCP boundary, from immediately below Loveland Dam&nbsp;
downstream to the upper edge of Sweetwater Reservoir. Subunit 18d&nbsp;
covers 3.2 km (2 mi) of Viejas Creek and associated uplands from the&nbsp;
western end of Viejas Valley downstream to the Congressional boundary&nbsp;
of the Cleveland National Forest (which is the eastern boundary of the&nbsp;
San Diego MSCP area).

[[Page 9425]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit is essential to arroyo toad conservation because it&nbsp;
supports several significant populations that can remain viable, and&nbsp;
hopefully interconnected, over the long-term, provided suitable habitat&nbsp;
conditions are maintained. The unit includes approximately 30 ha (80&nbsp;
ac) of the Viejas Indian Reservation along its southwestern boundary,&nbsp;
and 40 ha (100 ac) on the south side of the Sycuan Indian Reservation.&nbsp;
High quality riparian and alluvial terrace habitats occur along Viejas&nbsp;
Creek (Viejas Reservation) and the lower part of Sycuan Creek (Sycuan&nbsp;
Reservation) .

Unit 19: Cottonwood Creek Basin, San Diego County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 19 includes portions of Cottonwood Creek, adjacent uplands,&nbsp;
and portions of the following tributaries: Potrero Creek, Pine Valley&nbsp;
Creek, Scove Canyon, Morena Creek, La Posta Creek, and Kitchen Creek.&nbsp;
This large unit encompasses approximately 7,990 ha (19,740 ac), of&nbsp;
which 41 percent is within the Cleveland National Forest, 46 percent is&nbsp;
private land, and 11 percent is on land owned by San Diego County. The&nbsp;
unit consists of four disjunct subunits--two sections of Cottonwood&nbsp;
Creek and two sections of Pine Valley Creek. Subunit 19a covers 13 km&nbsp;
(8 mi) of Cottonwood Creek from Buckman Springs (near Interstate 8)&nbsp;
downstream to Morena Reservoir and includes approximately 6 km (3.7 mi)&nbsp;
of La Posta Creek, 6 km (3.7 mi) of Morena Creek, and 2.5 km (1.6 mi)&nbsp;
of Kitchen Creek. Subunit 19b covers almost 16 km (9.9 mi) of&nbsp;
Cottonwood Creek from approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) below Morena&nbsp;
Reservoir downstream to State Highway 94 (excluding Barrett Reservoir)&nbsp;
and includes 15 km (9.3 mi) of Potrero Creek from approximately the 752&nbsp;
m (2,466 ft) elevation benchmark downstream to the confluence with&nbsp;
Cottonwood Creek. Subunit 19c covers about 12 km (7.5 mi) of Pine&nbsp;
Valley Creek from the north edge of section 12 (T15S, R4E) downstream&nbsp;
to approximately 1 km (0.6 mi) south of Interstate 8 and includes&nbsp;
approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) of Scove Canyon and 1 km (0.6 mi) of Noble&nbsp;
Creek. Subunit 19d encompasses 13 km (8 mi) of Pine Valley Creek from&nbsp;
the Nelson Canyon confluence downstream to Barrett Reservoir.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit encompasses a large number of distinct arroyo toad&nbsp;
occurrences in an area where in-stream and/or overland dispersal&nbsp;
between populations is probably still possible. It also provides an&nbsp;
important linkage to populations occurring within the San Diego MSCP&nbsp;
area. The unit is essential to arroyo toad conservation because it&nbsp;
encompasses several large, populations and includes suitable habitat&nbsp;
for population expansion, which increases the probability of long-term&nbsp;
persistence.

Desert Recovery Unit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following four critical habitat units are in the Desert&nbsp;
Recovery Unit as described in the final recovery plan. Each of these&nbsp;
units is isolated from each other and from any other units, making the&nbsp;
issues of inbreeding, fragmentation, and random negative impacts of&nbsp;
great concern. However, this unit also represents unique ecological&nbsp;
conditions for arroyo toads, and possibly harbor significant genetic&nbsp;
diversity.

Unit 20: Little Rock Creek, Los Angeles County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 20 includes approximately 9.5 km (5.9 mi) of Little Rock Creek&nbsp;
and adjacent uplands, from the South Fork confluence downstream to the&nbsp;
upper end of Little Rock Reservoir (in the vicinity of Rocky Point&nbsp;
Picnic Ground), and approximately 1.8 km (1.1 mi) of Santiago Creek and&nbsp;
adjacent uplands upstream from the confluence with Little Rock Creek.&nbsp;
The unit encompasses approximately 600 ha (1,480 ac), all of which is&nbsp;
within the Angeles National Forest. Studies are currently under way to&nbsp;
better determine the distribution of the arroyo toad population along&nbsp;
the creek, monitor recruitment, and assess upland habitat use (Ramirez&nbsp;
2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 20 is essential for arroyo toad conservation because it&nbsp;
supports a unique, isolated population on the periphery of the species'&nbsp;
range. If a natural hydrologic regime can be maintained and impacts&nbsp;
from recreation activities can be minimized, the area has favorable&nbsp;
habitat conditions for the persistence of a small, but viable,&nbsp;
population.

Unit 21: Upper Mojave River Basin, San Bernardino County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 21 includes portions of the Mojave River, the West Fork of the&nbsp;
Mojave River, Horsethief and Little Horsethief creeks, Deep Creek, and&nbsp;
adjacent uplands. The unit encompasses approximately 6,685 ha (16,520&nbsp;
ac), of which 17 percent is within the San Bernardino National Forest,&nbsp;
60 percent is private land, 8 percent is State or local public land,&nbsp;
and 14 percent is U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-managed land associated&nbsp;
with a flood control reservoir. The unit is divided into three separate&nbsp;
subunits. Subunit 21a includes: (1) approximately 18 km (9.3 mi) of&nbsp;
Deep Creek from near Holcomb Creek downstream to the confluence with&nbsp;
the West Fork, (2) approximately 6.5 km (4 mi) of Little Horsethief&nbsp;
Creek from near the western edge of section 28 (T3N, R5W) downstream to&nbsp;
the confluence with Horsethief Creek, (3) approximately 5.5 km (3.4 mi)&nbsp;
of Horsethief Creek from the Little Horsethief Creek confluence&nbsp;
downstream to the West Fork confluence, (4) just over 7 km (4.3 mi) of&nbsp;
the West Fork of the Mojave River from the Horsethief Creek confluence&nbsp;
downstream to Mojave River Forks Dam, and (5) approximately 4 km (2.5&nbsp;
mi) of the Mojave River below Mojave River Forks Dam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subunit 21b includes approximately 18 km (11 mi) of the Mojave&nbsp;
River from just above the Upper Narrows (section 14, T5N, R4W)&nbsp;
downstream to approximately 6 km (3.7 mi) below the Lower Narrows&nbsp;
(section 13, T6N, R5W). Subunit 21c includes almost 3 km (1.9 mi) of&nbsp;
the upper West Fork of the Mojave River, above Silverwood Lake, from&nbsp;
near the 1462 m (3,613 ft) elevation benchmark downstream to the upper&nbsp;
end of the lake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the designated drainages in this unit are occupied by arroyo&nbsp;
toads. Summit Valley, which encompasses the lower portions of&nbsp;
Horsethief Creek and the West Fork of the Mojave River, is a broad,&nbsp;
flat, alluvial valley that supports a substantial arroyo toad&nbsp;
population (Ramirez 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 21 is essential to arroyo toad conservation because it&nbsp;
supports the largest population of the species on the desert side of&nbsp;
the mountains. If adequate streamflows and upland alluvial habitats can&nbsp;
be maintained, this is the one desert unit that has favorable&nbsp;
conditions for long-term persistence of a large toad population.

Unit 22: Whitewater River, Riverside County

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 22 includes approximately 9.5 km (5.9 mi) of the Whitewater&nbsp;
River and adjacent uplands, from near Red Dome downstream to where the&nbsp;
Colorado River Aqueduct crosses the river (south half of section 2,&nbsp;
T3S, R3E). The unit encompasses approximately 865 ha (2,150 ac), of&nbsp;
which 62 percent is BLM land and 38 percent is private land. The&nbsp;
current status of arroyo toads in this unit is poorly known. They were&nbsp;
observed and photographed in the drainage in 1992 (Jennings and Hayes&nbsp;
1994), but were not relocated in surveys conducted during the 2000&nbsp;
breeding season (Jones &amp; Stokes 2000). However, 2000 was generally a&nbsp;
bad year for arroyo toad breeding activity, particularly in the&nbsp;
southern half of the species range, because of below average&nbsp;
precipitation and subsequent low streamflows. Given the relatively&nbsp;
recent documentation of arroyo toads in this drainage, and the

[[Page 9426]]

continued presence of suitable habitat in the area, we belive it is&nbsp;
likely that this unit is still occupied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 22 is essential for arroyo toad conservation because it&nbsp;
supports a unique, isolated desert population on the eastern periphery&nbsp;
of the species' range. Also, if a natural hydrologic regime can be&nbsp;
maintained and impacts from recreation activities can be minimized, the&nbsp;
area has favorable habitat conditions for the persistence of a small,&nbsp;
but viable, population.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation

Section 7 Consultation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies, including the&nbsp;
Service, to ensure that actions they fund, authorize, or carry out do&nbsp;
not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat to the extent that the&nbsp;
action appreciably diminishes the value of the critical habitat for the&nbsp;
survival and recovery of the species. Individuals, organizations,&nbsp;
states, local governments, and other non-Federal entities are affected&nbsp;
by the designation of critical habitat only if their actions occur on&nbsp;
Federal lands, require a Federal permit, license, or other&nbsp;
authorization, or involve Federal funding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies, including the&nbsp;
Service, to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is&nbsp;
proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its&nbsp;
critical habitat, if any is proposed or designated. Regulations&nbsp;
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are&nbsp;
codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act, requires&nbsp;
Federal agencies to confer with us on any action that is likely to&nbsp;
jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in&nbsp;
destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.&nbsp;
Conference reports provide conservation recommendations to assist the&nbsp;
agency in eliminating conflicts that may be caused by the proposed&nbsp;
action. The conservation recommendations in a conference report are&nbsp;
advisory. If a species is listed or critical habitat is designated,&nbsp;
section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities&nbsp;
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species&nbsp;
or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency (action agency)&nbsp;
must enter into consultation with us. Through this consultation, we&nbsp;
would ensure that the permitted actions do not destroy or adversely&nbsp;
modify critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we issue a biological opinion concluding that a project is&nbsp;
likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical&nbsp;
habitat, we also provide reasonable and prudent alternatives to the&nbsp;
project, if any are identifiable. ``Reasonable and prudent&nbsp;
alternatives'' are defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as alternative actions&nbsp;
identified during consultation that can be implemented in a manner&nbsp;
consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that are consistent&nbsp;
with the scope of the Federal agency's legal authority and&nbsp;
jurisdiction, that are economically and technologically feasible, and&nbsp;
that the Director believes would avoid destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat. Reasonable and prudent alternatives&nbsp;
can vary from slight project modifications to extensive redesign or&nbsp;
relocation of the project. Costs associated with implementing a&nbsp;
reasonable and prudent alternative are similarly variable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulations at 50 CFR 402.16 require Federal agencies to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation on previously reviewed actions in instances where critical&nbsp;
habitat is subsequently designated and the Federal agency has retained&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control over the action or such&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control is authorized by law.&nbsp;
Consequently, some Federal agencies may request reinitiation of&nbsp;
consultation or conference with us on actions for which formal&nbsp;
consultation has been completed, if those actions may affect designated&nbsp;
critical habitat or adversely modify or destroy proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat. Conference reports assist the agency in eliminating conflicts&nbsp;
that may be caused by the proposed action, and may include&nbsp;
recommendations on actions to eliminate conflicts with or adverse&nbsp;
modifications to proposed critical habitat. The conservation&nbsp;
recommendations in a conference report are advisory.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may issue a formal conference report if requested by a Federal&nbsp;
agency. Formal conference reports on proposed critical habitat contain&nbsp;
an opinion that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as if critical&nbsp;
habitat were designated. We may adopt the formal conference report as&nbsp;
the biological opinion when the critical habitat is designated, if no&nbsp;
substantial new information or changes in the action alter the content&nbsp;
of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities on Federal lands that may affect the arroyo toad or its&nbsp;
critical habitat will require section 7 consultation. Activities on&nbsp;
private or State lands requiring a permit from a Federal agency, such&nbsp;
as a permit from the Army Corps under section 404 of the Clean Water&nbsp;
Act, a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit from the Service, or some other&nbsp;
Federal action, including funding (e.g., Federal Highway Administration&nbsp;
or Federal Emergency Management Agency funding), will also continue to&nbsp;
be subject to the section 7 consultation process. Federal actions not&nbsp;
affecting listed species or critical habitat and actions on non-Federal&nbsp;
and private lands that are not federally funded, authorized, or&nbsp;
permitted do not require section 7 consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires us to briefly evaluate and&nbsp;
describe in any proposed or final regulation that designates critical&nbsp;
habitat those activities involving a Federal action that may destroy or&nbsp;
adversely modify such habitat, or that may be affected by such&nbsp;
designation. Activities that may destroy or adversely modify critical&nbsp;
habitat include those that appreciably reduce the value of critical&nbsp;
habitat for both the survival and recovery of the arroyo toad. Within&nbsp;
critical habitat, this pertains only to those areas containing primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. We note that such activities may also jeopardize&nbsp;
the continued existence of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To properly portray the effects of critical habitat designation, we&nbsp;
must first compare the section 7 requirements for actions that may&nbsp;
affect critical habitat with the requirements for actions that may&nbsp;
affect a listed species. Section 7 prohibits actions funded,&nbsp;
authorized, or carried out by Federal agencies from jeopardizing the&nbsp;
continued existence of a listed species or destroying or adversely&nbsp;
modifying the listed species' critical habitat. Actions likely to&nbsp;
``jeopardize the continued existence'' of a species are those that&nbsp;
would appreciably reduce the likelihood of the species' survival and&nbsp;
recovery. Actions likely to ``destroy or adversely modify'' critical&nbsp;
habitat are those that would appreciably reduce the value of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the survival and recovery of the listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common to both definitions is an appreciable detrimental effect on&nbsp;
both survival and recovery of a listed species. Given the similarity of&nbsp;
these definitions, actions likely to destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
critical habitat would almost always result in jeopardy to the species&nbsp;
concerned, particularly when the area of the proposed action is&nbsp;
occupied by the species concerned. Designation of critical habitat in&nbsp;
areas occupied by the arroyo toad is not likely to result in a&nbsp;
regulatory burden above that already in place due to the presence of&nbsp;
the listed species.

[[Page 9427]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal agencies already consult with us on activities in areas&nbsp;
currently occupied by the species to ensure that their actions do not&nbsp;
jeopardize the continued existence of the species. These actions&nbsp;
include, but are not limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Regulation of activities affecting waters of the United States&nbsp;
by the Army Corps under section 404 of the Clean Water Act;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Regulation of water flows, damming, diversion, and&nbsp;
channelization by any Federal agency;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Road construction and maintenance, right-of-way designation,&nbsp;
and regulation of agricultural activities on Federal lands (such as&nbsp;
those managed by the Service, Forest Service, DOD, or BLM);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Regulation of grazing, mining, and recreation by the BLM, DOD,&nbsp;
Army Corps, or Forest Service;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Regulation of airport improvement activities by the Federal&nbsp;
Aviation Administration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Military training and maneuvers, facilities operations and&nbsp;
maintenance on Fort Hunter Liggett and other applicable DOD lands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Construction of roads and fences along the international border&nbsp;
with Mexico, and associated immigration enforcement activities by the&nbsp;
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Licensing of construction of communication sites by the Federal&nbsp;
Communications Commission; and,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) Funding of activities by the U.S. Environmental Protection&nbsp;
Agency, Department of Energy, Federal Emergency Management Agency,&nbsp;
Federal Highway Administration, or any other Federal agency.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All lands designated as critical habitat are within the geographic&nbsp;
range of the species occupied by the species and are likely to be used&nbsp;
by the arroyo toad, whether for foraging, breeding, growth of larvae&nbsp;
and juveniles, intra-specific communication, dispersal, migration&nbsp;
genetic exchange and sheltering. Thus, we consider all critical habitat&nbsp;
units to be occupied by the species. Federal agencies already consult&nbsp;
with us on activities in areas currently occupied by the species or if&nbsp;
the species may be affected by the action to ensure that their actions&nbsp;
do not jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Thus, we do&nbsp;
not anticipate additional regulatory protection will result from&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.

Exclusions Under Section 3(5)(A) Definition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sikes Act Improvement Act of 1997 (Sikes Act) requires each&nbsp;
military installation that includes land and water suitable for the&nbsp;
conservation and management of natural resources to complete, by&nbsp;
November 17, 2001, an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan&nbsp;
(INRMP). An INRMP integrates implementation of the military mission of&nbsp;
the installation with stewardship of the natural resources found there.&nbsp;
Each INRMP includes an assessment of the ecological needs on the&nbsp;
installation, including the need to provide for the conservation of&nbsp;
listed species; a statement of goals and priorities; a detailed&nbsp;
description of management actions to be implemented to provide for&nbsp;
these ecological needs; and a monitoring and adaptive management plan.&nbsp;
We consult with the military on the development and implementation of&nbsp;
INRMPs for installations with listed species. We believe that bases&nbsp;
that have completed and approved INRMPs that address the needs of the&nbsp;
species generally do not meet the definition of critical habitat&nbsp;
discussed above, as they require no additional special management or&nbsp;
protection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we do not include these areas in critical habitat&nbsp;
designations if they meet the following three criteria: (1) A current&nbsp;
INRMP must be complete and provide a conservation benefit to the&nbsp;
species; (2) the plan must provide assurances that the conservation&nbsp;
management strategies will be implemented; and (3) the plan must&nbsp;
provide assurances that the conservation management strategies will be&nbsp;
effective, by providing for periodic monitoring and revisions as&nbsp;
necessary. If all of these criteria are met, then the lands covered&nbsp;
under the plan would not meet the definition of critical habitat. As&nbsp;
the bases where we identified habitat essential for the conservation of&nbsp;
the arroyo toad, including Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Fallbrook&nbsp;
Naval Weapons Reserve, and Fort Hunter Liggett, do not have INRMPs that&nbsp;
meet the criteria, we did not exclude them under the section 3(5)(A)&nbsp;
definition.

Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection 4(b)(2) of the Act allows us to exclude areas from&nbsp;
critical habitat designation where the benefits of exclusion outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of designation, provided the exclusion will not result in&nbsp;
the extinction of the species. For the following reasons, we believe&nbsp;
that in most instances the benefits of excluding HCPs from critical&nbsp;
habitat designations will outweigh the benefits of including them.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of including HCP lands in critical habitat are&nbsp;
normally small. The principal benefit of any designated critical&nbsp;
habitat is that activities in such habitat that may affect it require&nbsp;
consultation under section 7 of the Act. Such consultation would ensure&nbsp;
that adequate protection is provided to avoid adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat. Where HCPs are in place, our experience indicates&nbsp;
that this benefit is small or non-existent. Currently approved and&nbsp;
permitted HCPs are already designed to ensure the long-term survival of&nbsp;
covered species within the plan area. Where we have an approved HCP,&nbsp;
lands that we ordinarily would define as critical habitat for the&nbsp;
covered species will normally be protected in reserves and other&nbsp;
conservation lands by the terms of the HCPs and their implementation&nbsp;
agreements. These HCPs and implementation agreements include management&nbsp;
measures and protections for conservation lands that are crafted to&nbsp;
protect, restore, and enhance their value as habitat for covered&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, an HCP application must itself be consulted upon.&nbsp;
While this consultation will not look specifically at the issue of&nbsp;
adverse modification of critical habitat, it will look at the very&nbsp;
similar concept of jeopardy to the listed species in the plan area.&nbsp;
Because HCPs, particularly large regional HCPs, address land use within&nbsp;
the plan boundaries, habitat issues within the plan boundaries will&nbsp;
have been thoroughly addressed in the HCP and through the consultation&nbsp;
on the HCP. Our experience is also that, under most circumstances,&nbsp;
consultations under the jeopardy standard will reach the same result as&nbsp;
consultations under the adverse modification standard. Implementing&nbsp;
regulations (50 CFR part 402) define ``jeopardize the continued&nbsp;
existence of'' and ``destruction or adverse modification of'' in&nbsp;
virtually identical terms. ``Jeopardize the continued existence of''&nbsp;
means to engage in an action ``that reasonably would be expected to&nbsp;
reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of&nbsp;
a listed species.'' Destruction or adverse modification means an&nbsp;
alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat&nbsp;
for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.'' Common to&nbsp;
both definitions is an appreciable detrimental effect on both survival&nbsp;
and recovery of a listed species, in the case of critical habitat by&nbsp;
reducing the value of the habitat so designated. Thus, actions&nbsp;
satisfying the standard for

[[Page 9428]]

adverse modification are nearly always found to also jeopardize the&nbsp;
species concerned, and the existence of a critical habitat designation&nbsp;
does not materially affect the outcome of consultation. Additional&nbsp;
measures to protect the habitat from adverse modification are not&nbsp;
likely to be required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, HCPs typically provide for greater conservation benefits&nbsp;
to a covered species than section 7 consultations because HCPs assure&nbsp;
the long term protection and management of a covered species and its&nbsp;
habitat, and funding for such management through the standards found in&nbsp;
the 5-Point Policy for HCPs (64 FR 35242) and the HCP No Surprises&nbsp;
regulation (63 FR 8859). Such assurances are typically not provided by&nbsp;
section 7 consultations which, in contrast to HCPs, often do not commit&nbsp;
the project proponent to long term special management or protections.&nbsp;
Thus, a consultation typically does not accord the lands it covers the&nbsp;
extensive benefits an HCP provides.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development and implementation of HCPs provide other important&nbsp;
conservation benefits, including the development of biological&nbsp;
information to guide conservation efforts and assist in species&nbsp;
recovery and the creation of innovative solutions to conserve species&nbsp;
while allowing for development. The educational benefits of critical&nbsp;
habitat, including informing the public of areas that are important for&nbsp;
the long-term survival and conservation of the species, are essentially&nbsp;
the same as those that would occur from the public notice and comment&nbsp;
procedures required to establish an HCP, as well as the public&nbsp;
participation that occurs in the development of many regional HCPs. For&nbsp;
these reasons, then, we believe that designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
has little benefit in areas covered by HCPs.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of excluding HCPs from being designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat may be more significant. During two public comment periods on&nbsp;
our critical habitat policy, we received several comments about the&nbsp;
additional regulatory and economic burden of designating critical&nbsp;
habitat. These include the need for additional consultation with the&nbsp;
Service and the need for additional surveys and information gathering&nbsp;
to complete these consultations. HCP applicants have also stated that&nbsp;
they are concerned that third parties may challenge HCPs on the basis&nbsp;
that they result in adverse modification or destruction of critical&nbsp;
habitat, should critical habitat be designated within the HCP&nbsp;
boundaries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of excluding HCPs include relieving landowners,&nbsp;
communities and counties of any additional minor regulatory review that&nbsp;
might be imposed by critical habitat. Many HCPs, particularly large&nbsp;
regional HCPs, take many years to develop and, upon completion, become&nbsp;
regional conservation plans that are consistent with the recovery of&nbsp;
covered species. Most regional plans benefit many species, both listed&nbsp;
and unlisted. Imposing an additional regulatory review after HCP&nbsp;
completion may jeopardize conservation efforts and partnerships in many&nbsp;
areas and could be viewed as a disincentive to those developing HCPs.&nbsp;
Excluding HCPs provides us with an opportunity to streamline regulatory&nbsp;
compliance and confirms regulatory assurances for HCP participants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related benefit of excluding HCPs is that it would encourage the&nbsp;
continued development of partnerships with HCP participants, including&nbsp;
states, local governments, conservation organizations, and private&nbsp;
landowners, that together can implement conservation actions we would&nbsp;
be unable to accomplish alone. By excluding areas covered by HCPs from&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, we preserve these partnerships and, we&nbsp;
believe, set the stage for more effective conservation actions in the&nbsp;
future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, then, we believe the benefits of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation to be small in areas covered by approved HCPs. We also&nbsp;
believe that the benefits of excluding HCPs from designation are&nbsp;
significant. Weighing the small benefits of inclusion against the&nbsp;
benefits of exclusion, including the benefits of relieving property&nbsp;
owners of an additional layer of approvals and regulation, together&nbsp;
with the encouragement of conservation partnerships, would generally&nbsp;
result in HCPs being excluded from critical habitat designation under&nbsp;
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all HCPs are alike with regard to species coverage and design.&nbsp;
Within this general analytical framework, we need to evaluate completed&nbsp;
and legally operative HCPs in the range of the arroyo toad on a case-
by-case basis to determine whether the benefits of excluding these&nbsp;
particular areas outweigh the benefits of including them.

Relationship to Habitat Conservation Plans

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act allows us broad discretion to exclude&nbsp;
from critical habitat designation areas where the benefits of exclusion&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of designation, provided the exclusion will not&nbsp;
result in the extinction of the species. We expect that critical&nbsp;
habitat may be used as a tool to identify those areas essential for the&nbsp;
conservation of the species, and we will encourage development of&nbsp;
Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) for such areas on non-Federal lands.&nbsp;
Habitat conservation plans currently under development are intended to&nbsp;
provide for protection and management of habitat areas essential for&nbsp;
the conservation of the arroyo toad, while directing development and&nbsp;
habitat modification to nonessential areas of lower habitat value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of habitat conservation planning efforts have been&nbsp;
completed within the range of the arroyo toad. Principal among these&nbsp;
are the NCCP/HCP efforts in San Diego and Orange counties. The San&nbsp;
Diego MSCP, and its approved subarea plans, provide measures to&nbsp;
conserve known populations of the arroyo toad within Santa Ysabel Creek&nbsp;
in San Pasqual Valley, San Vicente Creek above San Vicente Reservoir,&nbsp;
Sweetwater River, Otay River, and Cottonwood Creek in Marron Valley.&nbsp;
Area-specific management directives for MSCP subarea plans must address&nbsp;
the conservation of the arroyo toad by protecting and maintaining&nbsp;
sufficient, suitable low-gradient sandy stream habitat to meet breeding&nbsp;
requirements, preserving sheltering and foraging habitats within 1 km&nbsp;
(0.6 mi) of occupied breeding habitat within designated preserve lands,&nbsp;
controlling nonnative predators, and controlling human impacts within&nbsp;
designated preserves. Several of these plans are currently under&nbsp;
development, including ones for Marron and San Pasqual valleys.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One exception to the HCP exclusion concerns the reach of the&nbsp;
Sweetwater River between Loveland and Sweetwater Reservoirs within the&nbsp;
County of San Diego's MSCP plan. This area is affected by activities&nbsp;
(e.g., reservoir water transfers) that are outside the authority of&nbsp;
and, therefore, are not subject to the approved County's MSCP plan.&nbsp;
Therefore, we have included this limited reach of the Sweetwater River&nbsp;
as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also approved the Orange County Central Coastal NCCP/HCP,&nbsp;
which will result in the conservation of 15,677 ha (38,738 ac) of&nbsp;
Reserve lands, including habitat suitable for the arroyo toad. We&nbsp;
issued an incidental take permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act&nbsp;
that provides conditional incidental take authorization for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad for all areas within the Central-Coastal Subregion except the&nbsp;
North Ranch

[[Page 9429]]

Policy Plan area. This take authorization only applies to smaller&nbsp;
arroyo toad populations, reintroduced populations or populations that&nbsp;
have expanded due to NCCP Reserve management and requires&nbsp;
implementation of a mitigation plan to relocate toads to protected&nbsp;
areas within the Reserve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The North Ranch Policy Plan area was excluded from the take&nbsp;
authorization provided by the Central Coastal NCCP/HCP due to a lack of&nbsp;
detailed biological information and specific conservation commitments&nbsp;
at the time of adoption of the NCCP/HCP. Further, the NCCP/HCP does not&nbsp;
require future adoption of a management plan for the North Ranch Policy&nbsp;
Plan area. We have determined that available arroyo toad habitat within&nbsp;
the North Ranch Policy Plan area is essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the arroyo toad by helping to support a viable Santa Ana Mountain&nbsp;
arroyo toad population. Because the NCCP/HCP affords no long term&nbsp;
conservation commitments for this area, we have included a portion of&nbsp;
the North Ranch Policy Plan area as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of excluding lands covered by these HCPs would be&nbsp;
significant in preserving positive relationships with our conservation&nbsp;
partners, lessening potential additional regulatory review and&nbsp;
potential economic burdens, reinforcing the regulatory assurances&nbsp;
provided for in the implementation agreements for the approved HCPs,&nbsp;
and providing for more established and cooperative partnerships for&nbsp;
future conservation efforts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the benefits of including these HCPs in critical&nbsp;
habitat for the arroyo toad include increased educational benefits and&nbsp;
minor additional management protections and measures. The benefits of&nbsp;
excluding HCPs from being designated as critical habitat for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad include the additional conservation measures for the arroyo toad&nbsp;
and other listed species, preservation of partnerships that may lead to&nbsp;
future conservation, and the avoidance of the minor regulatory and&nbsp;
economic burdens associated with the designation of critical habitat.&nbsp;
The benefits of excluding these areas from critical habitat designation&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of including these areas. Furthermore, we have&nbsp;
determined that these exclusions will not result in the extinction of&nbsp;
the species. We have already completed section 7 consultation on the&nbsp;
impacts of these HCPs on the species. We have determined that they will&nbsp;
not jeopardize the continued existence of the species, which means that&nbsp;
they will not appreciably reduce likelihood of the survival and&nbsp;
recovery of the species. Consequently, these lands have not been&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat for the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitat conservation plans currently under development are intended&nbsp;
to provide for protection and management of habitat areas essential for&nbsp;
the conservation of the arroyo toad, while directing development and&nbsp;
habitat modification to nonessential areas of lower habitat value. The&nbsp;
HCP development process provides an opportunity for more intensive data&nbsp;
collection and analysis regarding the use of particular habitat areas&nbsp;
by the arroyo toad. The process also enables us to conduct detailed&nbsp;
evaluations of the importance of such lands to the long-term survival&nbsp;
of the species in the context of constructing a biologically configured&nbsp;
system of interlinked habitat blocks. We fully expect that HCPs&nbsp;
undertaken by local jurisdictions (e.g., counties, cities) and other&nbsp;
parties will identify, protect, and provide appropriate management for&nbsp;
those specific lands within the boundaries of the plans that are&nbsp;
essential for the long-term conservation of the species. We believe and&nbsp;
fully expect that our analyses of proposed HCPs and proposed projects&nbsp;
under section 7 will show that covered activities carried out in&nbsp;
accordance with the provisions of the HCPs and biological opinions will&nbsp;
not result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will provide technical assistance and work closely with&nbsp;
applicants throughout the development of future HCPs to identify lands&nbsp;
essential for the long-term conservation of the arroyo toad and&nbsp;
appropriate conservation and management actions. Several HCP efforts&nbsp;
are currently under way that address listed and nonlisted species in&nbsp;
areas within the range of the arroyo toad and in areas we propose as&nbsp;
critical habitat. The take minimization and mitigation measures&nbsp;
provided under these HCPs are expected to protect the essential habitat&nbsp;
lands designated as critical habitat in this rule and provide for the&nbsp;
conservation of the covered species. If an HCP that addresses the&nbsp;
arroyo toad is ultimately approved, the Service will reassess the&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries in light of the HCP. The Service will seek&nbsp;
to undertake this review when the HCP is approved, but funding&nbsp;
constraints may influence the timing of such a review.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the public comment period for the proposal, Marine Corps&nbsp;
Base Camp Pendleton (Camp Pendleton) submitted comments concluding that&nbsp;
critical habitat designation on the base is unnecessary based on&nbsp;
existing Marine Corps management plans that provide adequate special&nbsp;
management and protection for the species. Arroyo toad numbers on Camp&nbsp;
Pendleton are significant and are inclusive of the few remaining&nbsp;
populations along the coastal plain. In light of these factors, we&nbsp;
proposed 15,445 ha (38,150 ac) of the approximately 50,000 ha (125,000&nbsp;
acre) base as critical habitat for the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp Pendleton's programmatic conservation plan for riparian and&nbsp;
estuarine/beach ecosystems does not address arroyo toads in upland&nbsp;
habitats. Moreover, the programmatic instructions and conservation&nbsp;
measures in the plan need to be revised to avoid and minimize potential&nbsp;
adverse effects to the arroyo toad. As the Service indicated in a&nbsp;
letter dated February 9, 2000, these revisions include, ``but are not&nbsp;
limited to, implementation of a base-wide non-native predatory species&nbsp;
control program, removal of non-essential road crossings, modification&nbsp;
of existing and new road crossings, removal of unnecessary structures&nbsp;
and hardscape within arroyo toad breeding and non-breeding habitats,&nbsp;
and guidelines on the use of toad exclusion fencing.'' To address&nbsp;
endangered and threatened species issues within upland habitats on&nbsp;
base, on March 30, 2000, at the request of the Marines, we initiated&nbsp;
formal consultation with Camp Pendleton on their uplands activities.&nbsp;
These activities include military training, maintenance, fire&nbsp;
management, real estate, and recreation programs. Because of the&nbsp;
immense complexity of dealing with a multitude of hard-to-define upland&nbsp;
activities and numerous federally listed plants and animals, we expect&nbsp;
completion of the consultation and issuance of our biological opinion&nbsp;
to take several months to a year. Upon completion, this consultation&nbsp;
will address the 93 percent of the base not included in our 1995&nbsp;
opinion concerning the base's programmatic conservation plan for&nbsp;
riparian and estuarine/beach ecosystems (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&nbsp;
1995).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal included upland and riparian habitats within key&nbsp;
training areas on Camp Pendleton that represent about 30 percent of the&nbsp;
base. If this area is included in the final designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the arroyo toad, the Marines would be compelled by their&nbsp;
interpretation of the Endangered Species Act to significantly curtail&nbsp;
necessary training within the area designated as critical habitat, to&nbsp;
the detriment of mission-critical training capability, until the&nbsp;
programmatic uplands consultation is concluded, up to a year from now.&nbsp;
Avoiding areas

[[Page 9430]]

designated as critical habitat would greatly restrict use of the base,&nbsp;
severely limiting the Camp Pendleton's utility as a Marine training&nbsp;
site. The Marines have no alternative site suitable for the kinds of&nbsp;
training that occur on the base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, the benefits of designating critical habitat on the&nbsp;
base now are small. The primary benefit of designation is the&nbsp;
prohibition on destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat&nbsp;
under section 7 of the Act. However, we believe that section 7&nbsp;
consultation on any proposed action on the base that would result in an&nbsp;
adverse modification conclusion would also result in a jeopardy&nbsp;
conclusion, and we are now engaged in formal consultation with the&nbsp;
Marines on their activities in upland habitats on the Camp Pendleton.&nbsp;
In addition, the Marines have a statutory obligation under the Sikes&nbsp;
Act to complete an INRMP for Camp Pendleton about 10 months from now;&nbsp;
we expect that, when completed and adopted, this INRMP will provide&nbsp;
equal or greater protection to arroyo toad habitat on the base than a&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The INRMP for Camp Pendleton will be completed by the statutory&nbsp;
deadline of November 17, 2001. We will consult with the Marines under&nbsp;
section 7 of the Act on the development and implementation of the&nbsp;
INRMP. Today, as neither the INRMP nor the programmatic uplands&nbsp;
consultation have yet to be completed and approved, the lands proposed&nbsp;
as arroyo toad critical habitat on the base still meet the definition&nbsp;
of critical habitat. Nevertheless, we conclude that the benefits of&nbsp;
excluding Camp Pendleton exceed the benefits of including the base in&nbsp;
the critical habitat designation; further, we have determined that&nbsp;
excluding the base will not result in the extinction of the arroyo&nbsp;
toad, as numerous areas supporting arroyo toad populations remain&nbsp;
within the final critical habitat designation and sections 7(a)(2) and&nbsp;
9 still apply to the activities affecting arroyo toads on Camp&nbsp;
Pendleton. Thus, we have determined that it is appropriate to exclude&nbsp;
Camp Pendleton from this critical habitat designation under section&nbsp;
4(b)(2). The main benefit of this exclusion is ensuring that the&nbsp;
mission-critical military training activities can continue without&nbsp;
interruption at Camp Pendleton while the INRMP and programmatic uplands&nbsp;
consultation are being completed. This exclusion does not include that&nbsp;
part of Camp Pendleton leased to the State of California and included&nbsp;
within San Onofre State Park (including San Mateo Park) and those&nbsp;
agricultural leased lands adjacent to San Mateo Creek. Because these&nbsp;
lands are used minimally, if at all, by the Marines for training, the&nbsp;
lands proposed within the state park and agricultural leases are&nbsp;
retained in the final designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should additional information become available that changes our&nbsp;
analysis of the benefits of excluding any of these (or other) areas&nbsp;
compared to the benefits of including them in the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, we may revise this final designation accordingly.&nbsp;
Similarly, if new information indicates any of these areas should not&nbsp;
be included in the critical habitat designation because they no longer&nbsp;
meet the definition of critical habitat, we may revise this final&nbsp;
critical habitat designation. If, consistent with available funding and&nbsp;
program priorities, we elect to revise this designation, we will do so&nbsp;
through a subsequent rulemaking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have questions regarding whether specific activities will&nbsp;
constitute adverse modification of critical habitat, contact the Field&nbsp;
Supervisor, Ventura or Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Offices (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of the regulations on listed&nbsp;
wildlife, and inquiries about prohibitions and permits may be addressed&nbsp;
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Branch of Endangered Species,&nbsp;

503/231-6243).

Summary of Comments and Recommendations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the June 8, 2000, proposed rule, (65 FR 36512), we requested all&nbsp;
interested parties to submit comments on the specifics of the proposal&nbsp;
including information, policy, treatment of HCPs, and proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat boundaries as provided in the proposed rule. The first comment&nbsp;
period closed on August 7, 2000. The comment period was reopened from&nbsp;
November 9 to December 11, 2000 (65 FR 67334), to allow for additional&nbsp;
comments on the proposed rule and comments on the draft economic&nbsp;
analysis of the proposed critical habitat. We entered comments received&nbsp;
from August 8 to November 9, 2000, into the administrative record for&nbsp;
the second comment period.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We contacted appropriate Tribes, State and Federal agencies, county&nbsp;
governments, elected officials, and other interested parties and&nbsp;
invited them to comment. In addition, we invited public comment through&nbsp;
the publication of notices in the following newspapers in southern&nbsp;
California: Santa Maria Times, Los Angeles Times, Daily News-Press&nbsp;
(Victorville), Orange County Register, The Press-Enterprise, North&nbsp;
County Times, and the San Diego Union-Tribune. The inclusive dates of&nbsp;
these publications were June 10 and 12, 2000, for all papers. In these&nbsp;
notices and the proposed rule, we announced the dates and times of two&nbsp;
public hearings that were to be held on the proposed rule. These&nbsp;
hearings were in Valencia (June 27, 2000) and Temecula (June 29, 2000),&nbsp;
California. Transcripts of these hearings are available for inspection&nbsp;
(see ADDRESSES section).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We requested five herpetologists and conservation biologists who&nbsp;
have familiarity with the arroyo toad or related species and reserve&nbsp;
design to peer review the proposed critical habitat designation. Two of&nbsp;
the peer reviewers submitted comments on the proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We received a total of 155 comments, 38 oral and 117 written, from&nbsp;
131 commenters during the 2 comment periods. Of these comments, 12 of&nbsp;
the commenters who submitted oral testimony also submitted duplicative&nbsp;
or additional written comments, and 14 commenters submitted written&nbsp;
material during both comment periods. In total, oral and written&nbsp;
comments were received from 5 Federal agencies, 3 Tribes or their&nbsp;
representatives, 2 State agencies, 19 local governments or their&nbsp;
representatives, and 105 businesses, organizations or individuals. We&nbsp;
reviewed all comments received for substantive issues and new data&nbsp;
regarding critical habitat and the arroyo toad. Comments of a similar&nbsp;
nature are grouped into 6 general categories relating specifically to&nbsp;
the proposed critical habitat determination and draft economic analysis&nbsp;
of the proposed determination. These are addressed in the following&nbsp;
summary.

Issue 1: Comments on previous Federal actions, the Act and implementing&nbsp;
regulations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Comment: There were several comments regarding the listing of&nbsp;
the toad, the data on which the listing was based, and the lack of data&nbsp;
cited in the critical habitat proposal documenting the habitat losses&nbsp;
and threats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The purpose of this document is not to re-examine&nbsp;
the data and threats on which the listing was based. Within the&nbsp;
proposed rule, we provided information on the status of and threats to&nbsp;
the toad to provide background for the critical habitat proposal. The&nbsp;
losses and threats are documented in the rule to list the toad and in&nbsp;
the recovery plan, and the supporting documentation is in the files at&nbsp;
the Ventura and Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Offices (see ADDRESSES&nbsp;
section).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Comment: One commenter stated that, as the arroyo toad was only

[[Page 9431]]

recognized as a separate species in the 1980s (sic), it could not have&nbsp;
lost 75 percent of its habitat in that time as there has been a net&nbsp;
gain in wetlands during the 1990s.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The original description of the arroyo toad as a&nbsp;
separate species was made in 1915. At the time it was listed, we&nbsp;
recognized it as a subspecies of the southwestern toad. Based on&nbsp;
information discussed in the Background section we now know that the&nbsp;
arroyo toad is a separate species. We have corrected the table to&nbsp;
reflect this change. The arroyo toad has inhabited the coastal streams&nbsp;
and rivers of California and Baja California del Norte, Mexico, for a&nbsp;
long time. The habitat loss that it has suffered from dam construction&nbsp;
over the past 70 years has been compounded in some portions of its&nbsp;
range by agricultural activities and increased urbanization, both of&nbsp;
which continue to place pressure on the remaining toad habitats.&nbsp;
Although there may have been a net gain of wetlands in California in&nbsp;
the 1990s, this was not in habitats used by arroyo toads, but in other&nbsp;
types of systems, such as salt and fresh-water marshes, neither of&nbsp;
which are suitable for arroyo toads.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Comment: One commenter stated that the Act expired in 1993 and&nbsp;
no listings since then are valid, and that the Secretary has failed to&nbsp;
promulgate regulations on listings and critical habitat designations.&nbsp;
The commenter then claimed that no listings are valid, and as critical&nbsp;
habitat can only be designated ``concurrently and after'' a species is&nbsp;
listed, we can't designate critical habitat for the arroyo toad or any&nbsp;
other species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree. The Act remains in effect, even in&nbsp;
the absence of a multi-year authorization, and Congress continues to&nbsp;
appropriate funds to implement the administrative provisions of the Act&nbsp;
in each year. Regulations on listing threatened and endangered species&nbsp;
and on designating critical habitat are found at 50 CFR part 424,&nbsp;
specifically at sections 424.11 and 424.12.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Comment: Several commenters stated that it is inappropriate or&nbsp;
illegal to designate unoccupied areas as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Section 3(5)(A) of the Act defines critical&nbsp;
habitat for threatened and endangered species as specific areas both&nbsp;
within and outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the&nbsp;
time it is listed that are essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species; this definition is reiterated in the Code of Federal&nbsp;
Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR 424.02(d). Thus the Act expressly&nbsp;
authorizes the designation of both occupied and unoccupied habitat as&nbsp;
critical habitat. In the Act, conservation is defined as the use of all&nbsp;
methods and procedures needed to bring a species to the point at which&nbsp;
the measures provided by the Act are no longer necessary. This process&nbsp;
is also termed ``recovery.'' We have not designated any critical&nbsp;
habitat units outside the geographical area currently or historically&nbsp;
occupied by the species. In addition, all of the units designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat contain areas of known arroyo toad occupancy. However,&nbsp;
the extent of occupancy in each unit has not been fully determined.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Comment: One commenter stated that it is inappropriate to use a&nbsp;
recovery standard to define critical habitat, thus the proposed&nbsp;
designation is overly broad, contradictory to 1978 legislative history&nbsp;
directives (of narrow application), and does not meet statutory&nbsp;
standards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The Act defines critical habitat, in part, as&nbsp;
areas on which are found those physical or biological features&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the species. Conservation is defined&nbsp;
in the Act as the use of all methods and procedures needed to bring a&nbsp;
species to the point at which the measures provided by the Act are no&nbsp;
longer necessary, that is, to recover the species. The purpose of a&nbsp;
recovery plan is to describe site-specific actions necessary to achieve&nbsp;
conservation of listed species, criteria by which conservation can be&nbsp;
measured (that is, recovery standards), and estimates of time and costs&nbsp;
necessary to achieve recovery. In cases where recovery plans have been&nbsp;
developed before critical habitat is designated, those plans can be&nbsp;
very useful, as they identify the recovery criteria (standards) and the&nbsp;
actions and habitats necessary to meet those criteria. Recovery plans&nbsp;
also receive public and peer review. Therefore, we believe it is&nbsp;
appropriate to use an approved recovery plan for determining areas for&nbsp;
designation as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Comment: One commenter stated that, according to the Tenth&nbsp;
Circuit Court of Appeals finding in Catron County Board of Commerce,&nbsp;
New Mexico v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 75F.3d 1429&nbsp;
(10th Cir 1996) (Catron v. FWS) we are required to prepare an&nbsp;
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement before&nbsp;
designating critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The commenter is correct, in that the Tenth&nbsp;
Circuit Court of Appeals determined that an environmental assessment or&nbsp;
environmental impact statement should be prepared before designating&nbsp;
critical habitat. However, the finding in Catron v. FWS does not apply&nbsp;
to California, which is in the Ninth Circuit. In making critical&nbsp;
habitat determinations in California, we follow the Ninth Circuit Court&nbsp;
of Appeals decision in Douglas County v. Babbitt, 48 F.3d 1495 (9th&nbsp;
Cir. 1995). In that case the Court held that NEPA does not apply to the&nbsp;
Secretary's decision to designate critical habitat for an endangered or&nbsp;
threatened species under the ESA because (1) Congress intended that the&nbsp;
ESA critical habitat procedures displace the NEPA requirements, (2)&nbsp;
NEPA does not apply to actions that do not change the physical&nbsp;
environment, and (3) to apply NEPA to the ESA would further the&nbsp;
purposes of neither statute.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Comment: One commenter stated: ``Designating critical habitat&nbsp;
triggers specific legal protections * * *'' and toads and habitat&nbsp;
outside the 25 m (80 ft) elevational limit and 1.5 km distance would&nbsp;
``be denied these protections.'' Another commenter referred to&nbsp;
``restrictions imposed by critical habitat.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Critical habitat receives protection under&nbsp;
section 7 of the Act only through the prohibition against destruction&nbsp;
or adverse modification of critical habitat with regard to actions&nbsp;
carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency. The Act does&nbsp;
not provide other forms of protection to lands designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat. Because consultation under section 7 of the Act does not apply&nbsp;
to activities on private or other non-Federal lands that do not involve&nbsp;
a Federal nexus, critical habitat designation does not afford any&nbsp;
additional protections under the Act against such activities. On the&nbsp;
other hand, it should also be understood that exclusion of an area from&nbsp;
critical habitat does not mean that such habitat is unimportant or may&nbsp;
not, in the future, be determined to be necessary for recovery for the&nbsp;
species. Areas outside the critical habitat designation will continue&nbsp;
to be subject to the regulatory protections afforded by the section&nbsp;
7(a)(2) jeopardy standard and the section 9 take prohibitions, and such&nbsp;
areas may also be the recipients of conservation actions implemented&nbsp;
under sections 7(a)(1) and 10(a)(1). Section 7(a)(1) requires that&nbsp;
Federal agencies contribute to the conservation of listed species,&nbsp;
section 10(a)(1)(A) addresses recovery actions through research and&nbsp;
Safe Harbor agreements, and section 10(a)(1)(B) covers incidental take&nbsp;
permits issued in conjunction with approved HCPs.

Issue 2: Life history, habitat characteristics, and ecological&nbsp;
considerations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Comment: We received several comments relative to the soils&nbsp;
that toads use for burrowing or travel when migrating or dispersing.&nbsp;
Some commenters stated that toads only use sandy or loamy sand soils;&nbsp;
others stated that toads use compacted soils.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The best available information documents that&nbsp;
arroyo toads use sandy and loamy sand soils, as well as compacted&nbsp;
soils, although in different ways. Data and information we have&nbsp;
received since the publication of the proposal support our conclusion&nbsp;
that toads primarily burrow in loose sandy or loamy sand soils and that&nbsp;
areas of such soils are important habitat components in both the&nbsp;
riparian and upland zones. Arroyo toads do cross other soil types&nbsp;
during dispersal and migration, and, under suitable conditions, may&nbsp;
burrow into these for shelter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) Comment: One commenter stated that grazing is not harmful to&nbsp;
arroyo toads; intensive grazing is beneficial and should be encouraged,&nbsp;
as the species needs open, nonvegetated sandy stream channels and&nbsp;
terraces and wide-spread sedimentation due to overgrazing, and other&nbsp;
agricultural activities will improve habitat for the toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We agree that some properly managed grazing in&nbsp;
riparian areas may be compatible with toad survival and conservation,&nbsp;
but conclude that intensive grazing is detrimental to the conservation&nbsp;
of the arroyo toad. It is well documented that intensive grazing of&nbsp;
riparian areas degrades stream and riparian habitat, decreases water&nbsp;
quality, and causes direct mortality of arroyo toads. The arroyo toad&nbsp;
does need open stream channels and terraces, but it also requires some&nbsp;
vegetation in which to hide. Excessive cover by non-native plant&nbsp;
species such as arundo (giant reed) and tamarisk do not provide&nbsp;
appropriate conditions for arroyo toad breeding and survival.&nbsp;
Improperly managed grazing can denude stream banks and terraces&nbsp;
entirely, leading to increased erosion, and thus siltation of the sandy&nbsp;
substrate toads prefer; total removal of streamside vegetation also&nbsp;
leaves toads no place in which to escape from predators, high&nbsp;
temperatures, and other threats. The Service, other land mangers, and&nbsp;
livestock owners can work together to establish appropriate management&nbsp;
plans for arroyo toads and their habitat in areas where grazing does or&nbsp;
is likely to occur.

Issue 3: Critical habitat and primary constituent elements&nbsp;
descriptions, criteria, and methodology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10) Comment: One commenter stated that the language used to&nbsp;
describe the primary constituent elements was ambiguous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The commenter referred specifically to the&nbsp;
definition of primary constituent elements as contained in the Act,&nbsp;
which are general in nature and provide a framework for determining&nbsp;
what features and processes of the habitat are essential to provide for&nbsp;
the conservation of a species. The primary constituent elements for the&nbsp;
arroyo toad are identified in detail in both the proposal and this&nbsp;
final rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11) Comment: One commenter requested that we clarify how habitat&nbsp;
changes may result from natural processes and how that relates to&nbsp;
designating critical habitat in areas that do not support primary&nbsp;
constituent elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are not designating critical habitat in units&nbsp;
that are not occupied or do not support primary constituent elements.&nbsp;
All units support all of the primary constituent elements. While some&nbsp;
specific areas within a unit may provide only breeding habitat, only&nbsp;
upland habitat, or only migration and dispersal habitat, the unit is&nbsp;
properly evaluated as a whole, not by isolating small sections of it.&nbsp;
The statement regarding the changes that may occur in the&nbsp;
characteristics and suitability of upland habitat was for the purpose&nbsp;
of presenting a comprehensive picture of the dynamic systems in which&nbsp;
the toad has evolved. Relative to actual on-the-ground critical&nbsp;
habitat, processes such as fires, floods, and earthquakes may cause&nbsp;
excessive fine silts to be deposited in a documented breeding site one&nbsp;
year, making it unsuitable for breeding that year (and possibly for&nbsp;
several years) but that would not mean that the area would not still be&nbsp;
essential for arroyo toad conservation. Natural hydrologic processes&nbsp;
would remove the fine silt over time, restoring the area to suitable&nbsp;
breeding habitat. Toads may use what would ordinarily be deemed&nbsp;
marginal breeding habitat for that time period, or may forgo breeding&nbsp;
altogether. It is essential for this species' conservation that a&nbsp;
patchwork of habitats be recognized as actually or potentially occupied&nbsp;
at any given time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12) Comment: We received a request that we clarify how to treat&nbsp;
habitat that does not support ``all'' primary constituent elements.&nbsp;
Specifically, the commenter asked whether or not hard-surface roads and&nbsp;
stream crossings constitute critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response:s Habitat does not need to contain all of the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements to qualify as critical habitat. For&nbsp;
example, upland areas do not contain suitable breeding habitat, and&nbsp;
some areas used as migration and dispersal corridors may contain little&nbsp;
burrowing habitat. Although the hard-surface areas do not provide&nbsp;
burrowing habitat for arroyo toads, they can be used as foraging sites,&nbsp;
and smaller roads (i.e., one-and two-lane roads, and dirt roads) and&nbsp;
stream crossings do not constitute barriers to arroyo toads. Therefore,&nbsp;
hard-surface roads and stream crossings can be considered critical&nbsp;
habitat. We have by definition excluded areas such as buildings,&nbsp;
aquaducts and airports, because they do not contain any of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (13) Comment: One commenter stated that the presence of non-native&nbsp;
predators and plants makes habitat unsuitable and inappropriate for&nbsp;
designation as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Several non-native plant and animal species are&nbsp;
identified as threats to arroyo toads in the recovery plan and in the&nbsp;
critical habitat proposal. The presence of non-native competitors or&nbsp;
predators does not automatically preclude designation of an area as&nbsp;
critical habitat, if the area contains primary consetituent elements.&nbsp;
Such areas clearly are in need of special management as contemplated in&nbsp;
the definition of critical habitat in the Act, to decrease the numbers&nbsp;
of non-natives present and to correct, as appropriate, the habitat&nbsp;
conditions that allowed them to become established.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (14) Comment: Some commenters stated that areas where water flows&nbsp;
have been modified due to dams or other water management activities are&nbsp;
unsuitable and should not be designated, and requested removal of&nbsp;
specific areas as unsuitable for breeding due to habitat changes.&nbsp;
Conversely, other commenters stated that water diversions and quality&nbsp;
should be evaluated as part of the analysis of effects when issuing&nbsp;
incidental take permits under section 10 of the Act or conducting&nbsp;
consultations under section 7. Some of the latter also stated that the&nbsp;
Service should establish instream flow regime guidelines.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We have successfully worked with several water&nbsp;
management agencies to modify their flow regimes in such a manner to&nbsp;
meet their needs and goals as well as the needs of arroyo toads and&nbsp;
other native species. We believe additional efforts along these lines&nbsp;
will be successful in

[[Page 9433]]

allowing expansion or reestablishment of toad populations, while&nbsp;
meeting the needs of the water management agencies. We reviewed&nbsp;
specific recommendations, and revised the critical habitat units as we&nbsp;
determined to be appropriate. Some areas that commenters identified as&nbsp;
unsuitable were determined, on further evaluation, to be non-essential&nbsp;
for the survival and conservation of the arroyo toad, and so were&nbsp;
removed from critical habitat. Some areas were specifically included&nbsp;
because they serve as essential migratory or dispersal areas between&nbsp;
breeding areas or potential breeding areas, or between breeding and&nbsp;
upland habitats. Other areas remained in the final designation because&nbsp;
we believe that they are essential to stabilize and expand existing&nbsp;
populations, the primary goal of the recovery plan. These areas have&nbsp;
been retained because they are essential for the conservation of the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impacts of water diversions and water management actions, as&nbsp;
well as other issues of water quality, are evaluated for their effects&nbsp;
on arroyo toads and other listed species during consultations and&nbsp;
review of HCPs. Instream flow regime guidelines have been established&nbsp;
for some streams during the consultation process. As other water&nbsp;
management agencies enter into the consultation process, such&nbsp;
guidelines will be established as appropriate for those streams.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (15) Comment: Some parties commented on the fragmentation of upland&nbsp;
habitats by road construction projects. One commenter stated their&nbsp;
belief that State Highway 76, along the San Luis Rey River in San Diego&nbsp;
County, constitutes an impassable barrier to arroyo toads and that&nbsp;
critical habitat should not extend beyond that road.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We also are concerned about direct and indirect&nbsp;
effects of road construction on arroyo toads and their habitat, and&nbsp;
continually seek ways to avoid or reduce such impacts. Highway 76 is a&nbsp;
two-lane road with relatively low traffic volume during late-night and&nbsp;
pre-dawn hours, which should allow for some toads to cross it safely.&nbsp;
In addition, there are numerous undercrossings that allow toads to move&nbsp;
up tributary drainages and then into the uplands. Therefore, we believe&nbsp;
that Highway 76 will not seriously impede migration and dispersal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (16) Comment: The broad scale of the proposed critical habitat maps&nbsp;
is not specific enough to allow for reasonable public comment and&nbsp;
therefore violates the Act. The proposal does not identify specific&nbsp;
areas and defers designation of geographically specific areas to future&nbsp;
consultations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We identified specific areas in the proposed&nbsp;
determination that are referenced by UTM coordinates, which are found&nbsp;
on standard topographic maps. We also made maps available at the public&nbsp;
hearings and at the Ventura and Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Offices with&nbsp;
the proposed critical habitat units superimposed on 7.5 minute&nbsp;
topographic maps and aerial photos. Further, we distributed GIS&nbsp;
coverages and maps of the proposed critical habitat units to everyone&nbsp;
who requested them. We believe the information made available to the&nbsp;
public was sufficiently detailed to allow for informed public comment.&nbsp;
This final rule contains the legal descriptions of areas designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat as required under 50 CFR 424.12(c). All lands within&nbsp;
the boundaries established by the listed UTMs are designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat. If additional clarification is necessary, contact the&nbsp;
Ventura or Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (17) Comment: The scope of the proposal was overly broad, in that&nbsp;
too wide a zone on either side of the streams was proposed, and too&nbsp;
much marginal or unsuitable habitat was included; there was a lack of&nbsp;
accuracy and detail in mapping leading to the concern that developed&nbsp;
areas and infrastructure are within the boundaries and will be&nbsp;
considered critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We recognize that not all parcels of land within&nbsp;
designated critical habitat will contain the habitat components&nbsp;
essential to arroyo toad conservation. We are required to describe&nbsp;
critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12(c)) with specific limits using&nbsp;
reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the&nbsp;
area. The approach to developing the proposed critical habitat was&nbsp;
based on the best available scientific information, and on the&nbsp;
development of a scientifically supportable model for predicting arroyo&nbsp;
toad habitat. While some commenters believe that no habitat they judge&nbsp;
to be marginal or unsuitable should be included within the critical&nbsp;
habitat boundaries, the primary constituent elements include not just&nbsp;
sandy soils and breeding habitat, but the processes that will allow&nbsp;
appropriate breeding conditions to persist over time. Therefore, we&nbsp;
take a broader view of the essential components of arroyo toad habitat&nbsp;
than do some of the commenters. The hydrologic regimes (including&nbsp;
natural flooding), scouring and depositional events, and other&nbsp;
processes that have caused specific habitats to develop and be&nbsp;
maintained must continue to operate for the arroyo toad to persist over&nbsp;
the long term. Because such processes and their maintenance are&nbsp;
necessary for the persistence of suitable habitat for the arroyo toad,&nbsp;
we could have proposed entire watersheds for designation as critical&nbsp;
habitat. Doing so would have involved much more extensive areas than we&nbsp;
proposed. We concluded that designation of smaller areas would&nbsp;
accomplish the goal of maintaining the processes on which arroyo toad&nbsp;
habitat is dependent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that the systems the toad inhabits are dynamic, and that&nbsp;
specific breeding and burrowing sites can change from year to year, and&nbsp;
because of the need to provide routes for migration and dispersal,&nbsp;
areas are included that do not now appear to or may never be&nbsp;
appropriate breeding habitat or burrowing habitat. However, these areas&nbsp;
still fulfill an essential role in the arroyo toad's life history&nbsp;
pattern, and are essential for the conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the time constraints imposed by the Court, and the absence&nbsp;
of detailed GIS coverages during the preparation of the proposed&nbsp;
determination, a 1 km UTM grid was used to delineate the proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries. This resulted in the inclusion of some&nbsp;
areas that are not essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad. In&nbsp;
preparing the final determination, we used more detailed GIS coverages&nbsp;
that allowed us to reduce our minimum mapping unit to a 250 m UTM grid&nbsp;
square. This resulted in more refined critical habitat boundaries that&nbsp;
exclude many areas which do not contain the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements for arroyo toads. The smaller minimum mapping unit used in&nbsp;
defining the final critical habitat boundaries still did not allow us&nbsp;
to exclude all developed areas such as towns, housing developments,&nbsp;
airports, or other developed lands unlikely to provide habitat for the&nbsp;
arroyo toad. However, because these developed areas do not contain the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements for the arroyo toad, we believe that&nbsp;
activities occurring on them will not affect critical habitat and thus&nbsp;
will not trigger a section 7 consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (18) Comment: Some commenters believe that the Service did not use&nbsp;
the best available information, and failed to consider information&nbsp;
obtained since the listing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree. We are under a Court order to&nbsp;
finalize this critical habitat designation by January 19, 2001. When&nbsp;
developing any listing

[[Page 9434]]

proposal or proposed critical habitat designation we use the best&nbsp;
information available at the time, and we solicit information from a&nbsp;
variety of sources. We use information that is in our files, and we&nbsp;
request information from Federal and state agencies, consultants, and&nbsp;
researchers during the development of the proposal. The recovery plan&nbsp;
for the arroyo toad incorporated information obtained since the species&nbsp;
was listed, as well as earlier information. The critical habitat&nbsp;
proposal incorporated information obtained since the drafting and&nbsp;
finalization of the recovery plan, as documented by the incorporation&nbsp;
of references from 1999 and 2000. The public comment periods provided&nbsp;
additional opportunities to collect information. Comments received on&nbsp;
the proposed designation and the draft economic analysis and additional&nbsp;
information received during the comment periods have been taken into&nbsp;
account in the development of this final determination. Further, we&nbsp;
will continue to monitor and collect new information and may revise the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation in the future if new information supports&nbsp;
a change.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (19) Comment: One commenter made several suggestions: reevaluate&nbsp;
the upland habitat requirements of the arroyo toad, conduct further&nbsp;
surveys, and incorporate published information from a wider range of&nbsp;
scientists in our evaluation of the necessity of uplands to the&nbsp;
species' survival.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We have evaluated all of the available&nbsp;
information collected by or provided to us by researchers, consultants,&nbsp;
surveyors, land managers, and interested parties. None of the documents&nbsp;
concerning movements of toads and the upland they habitat use consist&nbsp;
of peer-reviewed, published papers. They consist of annual reports&nbsp;
<b>filed</b> by permit holders, reports submitted to the Service and other&nbsp;
agencies by individuals conducting surveys and studies, and unpublished&nbsp;
data and information submitted to us by those same individuals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properly functioning watersheds are integral to the survival and&nbsp;
recovery of the arroyo toad, and upland habitats are crucial to the&nbsp;
survival of the species. The primary constituent elements consist of an&nbsp;
appropriate hydrologic regime that includes a natural flooding regime,&nbsp;
the presence and replenishment of proper substrates, upland habitats&nbsp;
sufficient to support foraging and non-breeding activities, a lack of&nbsp;
non-native species (plants and animals), barrier-free dispersal and&nbsp;
migration corridors, and undisturbed habitats. The only way appropriate&nbsp;
hydrologic regimes can be maintained and appropriate depositional&nbsp;
processes ensured is by having healthy upland habitats. The primary&nbsp;
constituent elements, therefore, go beyond the simple needs of the toad&nbsp;
for breeding, foraging, and dispersal, and incorporate landscape level&nbsp;
and geological time-scale processes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (20) Comment: Some commenters expressed their opinion that reliance&nbsp;
on one habitat model (Barto 1999) was inadequate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Response: We did not rely solely on the habitat model&nbsp;
developed by Barto (1999). An approach similar to that used by Barto&nbsp;
was used to identify stream reaches that contain appropriate breeding&nbsp;
habitat, but we went beyond that in determining upland habitats,&nbsp;
dispersal and migration corridors. We incorporated information used to&nbsp;
develop the recovery plan and additional information received since&nbsp;
that time, including predictive habitat maps developed by the Forest&nbsp;
Service and several planning efforts in Southern California, more&nbsp;
recent field studies, and information from a variety of sources.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (21) Comment: One commenter stated that the critical habitat&nbsp;
proposal was not developed through a scientifically valid process, and&nbsp;
that the use of GIS technology is scientifically questionable and&nbsp;
illegal. Referencing the June 14, 1999, notice requesting comments on&nbsp;
how the Service designates critical habitat, the commenter stated that&nbsp;
we cannot use GIS to determine critical habitat boundaries unless the&nbsp;
public has an opportunity to comment on the use of the technology.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Response: The development of predictive models has been&nbsp;
used for decades in numerous fields, including hydrology, economics,&nbsp;
air quality management, and wildlife habitat management. GIS technology&nbsp;
is an effective tool for using spatial data to evaluate species-habitat&nbsp;
relationship. It is appropriate to use such tools to determine the&nbsp;
location and extent of habitat a species needs to meet stated&nbsp;
conservation goals. The Act and implementing regulations do not&nbsp;
constrain the methods to be used in determining critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries, but do state that the best available scientific and&nbsp;
commercial information shall be used. The GIS layers represent the best&nbsp;
available information on topography, stream gradient, soil types,&nbsp;
floodplain width, and other parameters that we have for many of the&nbsp;
areas where toads exist. As such, using GIS technology to determine&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries is consistent with the law, our policies,&nbsp;
and guidance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (22) Comment: One commenter believes the critical habitat proposal&nbsp;
was not developed through a legally valid process, stated that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat requires field visits, and was opposed&nbsp;
to the use of GIS maps as legal descriptions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Response: We followed the implementing regulations, our&nbsp;
policy and guidance in determining the areas to propose for inclusion&nbsp;
in critical habitat for the arroyo toad. The Act and implementing&nbsp;
regulations do not require that we make on-site visits to determine the&nbsp;
suitability of habitat. We do, to some extent, rely on our partner&nbsp;
agencies and the commenters to provide us with more detailed&nbsp;
information during the comment period. After the comment period, we&nbsp;
review the proposed boundaries and make modifications as appropriate.&nbsp;
The GIS maps are not the legal descriptions of the habitat. We provided&nbsp;
legal descriptions, as required by regulation (50 CFR 424.12(c)), with&nbsp;
specific limits using reference points (UTM coordinates) as found on&nbsp;
standard topographic maps of the areas. There is no requirement in the&nbsp;
law or regulation that the boundaries of critical habitat be surveyed&nbsp;
and delineated on the ground.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (23) Comment: Some commenters believe that, because most toad&nbsp;
sightings are within 500 m (0.3 mi) of streams, the upland habitat&nbsp;
distance should be reduced to 500 m (0.3 mi).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Although most arroyo toad sightings may have been&nbsp;
within 500 m (0.3 mi) of the streams, there are numerous sightings&nbsp;
beyond that distance. The shorter distance for the majority of&nbsp;
sightings is likely due to several factors, including sampling&nbsp;
artifacts (i.e., habitats further away were not sampled), reduced&nbsp;
availability of upland habitats in the areas where telemetry studies&nbsp;
have been conducted, and the difficulty in detecting toads during&nbsp;
dispersal and migration. There are a sufficient number of sightings of&nbsp;
toads beyond 500 m from streams that the experts' evaluation is that&nbsp;
arroyo toads regularly use available habitat beyond that distance. They&nbsp;
may use the land for estivation, overwintering, foraging, dispersal to&nbsp;
new or adjacent breeding areas, and migration from breeding to non-
breeding habitats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also important to remember that, in managing for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad and in designating critical habitat, we need to ensure that&nbsp;
natural hydrological, fluvial and geomorphological processes can&nbsp;
continue. This will require thorough review of activities that occur&nbsp;
within not only the critical habitat boundaries, but elsewhere in the&nbsp;
designated watersheds and other watersheds in which arroyo toads live.&nbsp;
It does not

[[Page 9435]]

mean that all projects within critical habitat boundaries or designated&nbsp;
watersheds will be precluded, but that not only the direct, but also&nbsp;
the indirect effects on the toad's habitat must be evaluated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (24) Comment: One commenter stated that using the 25m (80 ft)&nbsp;
elevational limit excludes the majority of upland habitat records.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Based on our analysis of available arroyo toad&nbsp;
location data, which is described in this rule and included in the&nbsp;
administrative record, over 85 percent of documented upland habitat&nbsp;
locations are within the final critical habitat boundaries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (25) Comment: One commenter stated that the Service ignored the&nbsp;
potential for arroyo toads to disperse over distances in excess of 2 km&nbsp;
(1.2 mi).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We did consider the possibility of such&nbsp;
movements, and cite dispersal movements of approximately 6 to 8 km (4&nbsp;
to 5 mi) along a stream corridor. We do not have sufficient data to&nbsp;
estimate with any reliability the proportion of toads that may make&nbsp;
long-distance overland movements. About half of the critical habitat&nbsp;
units are separated from the next closest unit by distances in excess&nbsp;
of 10 km (6 mi); the distances between the centers of toad populations&nbsp;
or areas with the highest concentrations of toads are even greater.&nbsp;
Based on the available information, which is cited in the rule, we&nbsp;
believe overland dispersal movements are unlikely to occur between such&nbsp;
widely separated populations. Therefore, we believe it is unnecessary&nbsp;
to include large extents of upland habitat between units in this&nbsp;
designation. We believe that the designated critical habitat is&nbsp;
sufficient to provide for the long term survival and conservation of&nbsp;
the toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (26) Comment: One commenter stated that the Service did not discuss&nbsp;
dispersal enough and should do so for each critical habitat unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We recognize the importance of dispersal in&nbsp;
maintaining viable arroyo toad populations and incorporated available&nbsp;
information in determining the distribution and boundaries of the&nbsp;
critical habitat units. Several of the units, particularly those in the&nbsp;
northern and desert recovery units, are isolated from each other by&nbsp;
distances of 10 to 160 km (6 to 100 mi). The only two critical habitat&nbsp;
units in the northern recovery unit that have centers of toad&nbsp;
populations less than 10 km (6 mi) apart are separated by Interstate 5,&nbsp;
which we consider an impassable barrier in terms of overland migration.&nbsp;
We clearly stated in the proposal that we expect dispersal to occur&nbsp;
along streams, and between streams if the habitat is suitable and the&nbsp;
streams are close enough. At this time, we do not have enough&nbsp;
information to predict, with any degree of certainty, the minimum or&nbsp;
maximum distances toads will travel overland in different environments.&nbsp;
We noted particular units in which we believe overland dispersal is&nbsp;
likely to occur between critical habitat units, between subunits, or&nbsp;
between tributaries within units. We did not ignore the possibility&nbsp;
that overland dispersal may occur in units in which we did not discuss&nbsp;
it, but we do not believe there are sufficient data available to make&nbsp;
claims that overland dispersal does or will occur between units that&nbsp;
are separated by 10 km (6 mi) or more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (27) Comment: One commenter stated that insufficient areas were&nbsp;
designated to provide for the recovery of the arroyo toad, and stated&nbsp;
that we ignored ``known'' populations of arroyo toads in our&nbsp;
designation, particularly those on Amargosa Creek in Los Angeles&nbsp;
County, the lower San Luis Rey River in San Diego County, and `` * * *&nbsp;
other areas * * * particularly in Riverside County.'' Other commenters&nbsp;
made specific suggestions regarding areas they thought should be&nbsp;
designated, including all tributaries of the Santa Clara River in Los&nbsp;
Angeles and Ventura counties; the Cucamonga and Cajon watersheds, San&nbsp;
Bernardino County; additional portions of San Mateo Creek, San Diego&nbsp;
and Riverside counties; Temescal Creek, Orange County; and portions of&nbsp;
Temecula Creek, Riverside County.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree that insufficient land has been&nbsp;
designated to provide for the recovery of the arroyo toad. All of the&nbsp;
critical habitat areas are considered essential to the species'&nbsp;
conservation, and the critical habitat closely follows the&nbsp;
recommendations of the recovery plan. Exceptions are primarily those&nbsp;
areas where it was recently determined that arroyo toads do not occur&nbsp;
currently and most likely did not occur historically (e.g., Pinto Wash&nbsp;
in Imperial County, San Felipe and Vallecitos Creeks in San Diego&nbsp;
County). In addition, several areas identified for recovery actions,&nbsp;
such as the upper Salinas River and the Otay River basin, are not&nbsp;
included in this designation. By evaluating the downlisting and&nbsp;
delisting criteria in the ``Recovery Plan for the Arroyo Southwestern&nbsp;
Toad'' relative to the designated critical habitat units, we determined&nbsp;
that the critical habitat units as designated will provide adequately&nbsp;
for the survival and recovery of the arroyo toad in each of the&nbsp;
recovery units. Sufficient land is designated within each of the&nbsp;
targeted drainages or basins to provide multiple opportunities to&nbsp;
protect toad populations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not include all of the specific lands listed above in the&nbsp;
proposal because, at the time of proposal, we concluded that these&nbsp;
lands were not essential for the conservation of the arroyo toad or did&nbsp;
not meet the definition of critical habitat, as discussed below. Also,&nbsp;
the Act states, at section 3(5)(C), that except in particular&nbsp;
circumstances determined by the Secretary ``critical habitat shall not&nbsp;
include the entire geographical area which can be occupied by the&nbsp;
threatened or endangered species.'' We did not designate critical&nbsp;
habitat in the upper Salinas River watershed, the entire length of or&nbsp;
all tributaries to currently occupied rivers or watersheds, or areas&nbsp;
that have arroyo toads but that we did not deem essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the first commenter's suggestions, no documentation of&nbsp;
the populations referred to was provided. We are aware of the supposed&nbsp;
sighting on Amargosa Creek, and have tried for several years to obtain&nbsp;
confirmation of the sighting. To date, we have been unable to obtain&nbsp;
any documentation that confirms the sighting. We proposed nearly the&nbsp;
entire length of the lower and middle stretches of the San Luis Rey&nbsp;
River for inclusion in critical habitat, excluding only heavily&nbsp;
urbanized portions downstream of the confluence of the San Luis Rey and&nbsp;
Guajome Creek (unit 14); we believe the populations to which the&nbsp;
commenter was referring are included. Regarding the suggestion that we&nbsp;
should include additional unspecified areas in Riverside County, we&nbsp;
believe we have identified all appropriate essential habitat in the&nbsp;
county.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all tributaries of the Santa Clara River contain suitable&nbsp;
breeding or upland habitat for the arroyo toad, nor do they provide&nbsp;
dispersal corridors from one area of breeding habitat to another. We&nbsp;
determined that many tributaries to the Santa Clara River, Cucamonga&nbsp;
Wash, and portions of upper San Mateo Creek, Temecula Creek and the&nbsp;
upper San Luis Rey River are not essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species. Therefore, we did not propose critical habitat for those&nbsp;
areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the intent of the Act, nor is it within the law, our&nbsp;
policy or guidelines, to designate critical habitat for every&nbsp;
population and every documented historic location of a species. The&nbsp;
recovery goal for the arroyo toad is to conserve the phenotypic and&nbsp;
genetic diversity of the toad in each of the recovery units, as&nbsp;
discussed in the Critical Habitat Designation section. We

[[Page 9436]]

have determined that the critical habitat units we have designated&nbsp;
will, when properly managed, provide sufficient habitat to support&nbsp;
enough self-sustaining populations of arroyo toads across the historic&nbsp;
range of the species to meet the downlisting and delisting criteria.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cajon Wash sighting was made after the publication of the&nbsp;
proposal. Significant additions to the proposed critical habitat would&nbsp;
require an additional public comment period. Because we did not propose&nbsp;
the area as critical habitat and provide members of the public an&nbsp;
opportunity to comment on its inclusion, and we are under a Court order&nbsp;
to finalize this critical habitat designation by January 19, 2001, we&nbsp;
are not including Cajon Wash in this final designation. If, on further&nbsp;
evaluation, we determine that these or other populations and areas are&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the arroyo toad and that the areas&nbsp;
need special management or protection, we will propose them for&nbsp;
inclusion, given workload and budgetary constraints.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (28) Comment: One commenter stated that we should not include the&nbsp;
lower Sisquoc River as second and third order streams are the most&nbsp;
productive arroyo toad habitats, not sixth order streams.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The commenter provided no data to support the&nbsp;
statement that second and third order streams are more productive&nbsp;
arroyo toad habitat than sixth order streams. We do have data on at&nbsp;
least one sixth order stream, Santa Margarita River in San Diego&nbsp;
County, that supports a large arroyo toad population. The lower Sisquoc&nbsp;
River, and other fifth and sixth order streams (for example, the Santa&nbsp;
Clara and San Luis Rey Rivers), have been strongly affected by&nbsp;
intensive agriculture, urbanization, and sand and gravel mining&nbsp;
operations. Each system was evaluated to determine if it is essential&nbsp;
to the conservation of the arroyo toad and if it needs special&nbsp;
management or protection. Those systems that met both criteria have&nbsp;
been included in this final designation.

Issue 4: Military Lands

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (29) Comment: The Department of Defense (DOD) requested that their&nbsp;
lands be excluded from the critical habitat designation because&nbsp;
protections and management afforded the arroyo toad under Integrated&nbsp;
Natural Resource Management Plans (INRMPs) pursuant to the Sikes Act&nbsp;
and under existing programmatic biological opinions were sufficient,&nbsp;
thereby resulting in their lands not requiring special management or&nbsp;
protection and not meeting the definition of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We address the issue of military lands in detail&nbsp;
in the previous section entitled ``Benefits of Exclusion''. As&nbsp;
discussed in that section, subsection 4(b)(2) of the Act allows us to&nbsp;
exclude areas where the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of&nbsp;
inclusion. Our analysis of the costs and benefits of inclusion of&nbsp;
military lands led us to conclude that the benefits of excluding&nbsp;
certain military lands outweigh the benefits of including them. Please&nbsp;
refer to that section of this document for the details. We are involved&nbsp;
in discussions with DOD to ensure that the arroyo toad is adequately&nbsp;
addressed under existing programmatic biological opinions or through&nbsp;
ongoing programmatic consultations covering training activities,&nbsp;
construction, controlled burning, wildfire management and other&nbsp;
activities on the military reserves. In addition, DOD is in the process&nbsp;
of developing INRMPs and Endangered Species Management Plans (ESMP) for&nbsp;
the arroyo toad and other listed species on their military reserves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (30) Comment: Certain commenters stated that we failed to consider&nbsp;
the military mission and the cumulative effects of multiple critical&nbsp;
habitat designations on the ability of the Department of Defense to&nbsp;
achieve mission goals, and pointed out that military bases cannot be&nbsp;
set aside as preserves, nor used to mitigate off-site impacts such as&nbsp;
urbanization.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton is the Marine&nbsp;
Corps' only amphibious training base on the west coast. During the&nbsp;
public comment periods for the proposal, the Marines informed us that&nbsp;
the designation, if made final, had ``the potential to substantially&nbsp;
degrade the military capabilities of both the installation and assigned&nbsp;
operational forces.'' Although the areas proposed on Camp Pendleton are&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the toad, designation would&nbsp;
significantly impair critical training. Therefore, we have excluded&nbsp;
Camp Pendleton from this final designation. Our rationale for this&nbsp;
exclusion is discussed in more detail in the section ``Exclusions under&nbsp;
section 4(b)(2)'', above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lands designated on Fort Hunter Liggett and Fallbrook Naval&nbsp;
Weapons Reserve are essential for the conservation of the toad, and are&nbsp;
not adequately addressed under existing management plans. Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett seemed most concerned in their comments about the inclusion of&nbsp;
what they termed ``marginal and unsuitable'' habitat and the resulting&nbsp;
consultation requirements, and the perceived need to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation on certain actions. We believe we have adequately&nbsp;
addressed much of their concern by eliminating the northernmost reach&nbsp;
of the river that was proposed, and by the reduction in grid cell size&nbsp;
to eliminate such marginal habitat (see Changes from the Proposal&nbsp;
section). Several of the consultations they mentioned would not need to&nbsp;
be reinitiated, as there will clearly be no effect on the habitat (e.g.&nbsp;
bullfrog removal program). They have already begun the process of&nbsp;
reinitiating consultation on their programmatic biological opinion,&nbsp;
which was necessitated by new information on the toad and by the recent&nbsp;
listing of the purple amole, Chlorogalum purpureum, not by the proposal&nbsp;
of critical habitat for the toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A primary concern expressed by Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station is&nbsp;
that the designation of critical habitat within certain developed areas&nbsp;
will impose additional restrictions on their operations. However,&nbsp;
existing structures, ordnance storage magazines and bunkers, and other&nbsp;
developed areas do not provide the primary constituent elements&nbsp;
necessary for the arroyo toad and thus by definition are not critical&nbsp;
habitat. Federal actions limited to these areas would not trigger a&nbsp;
section 7 consultation, unless they might affect individual arroyo&nbsp;
toads and/or the primary constituent elements in adjacent critical&nbsp;
habitat.

Issue 5: Relationship of critical habitat to HCPs, NCCP program,&nbsp;
section 7, and section 404

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (31) Comment: Some commenters were supportive of the policy that&nbsp;
lands covered by approved and future HCPs that provide take&nbsp;
authorization for the arroyo toad should be excluded from critical&nbsp;
habitat. Several commenters suggested that designated critical habitat&nbsp;
be removed concurrently with approval of the HCP because they are&nbsp;
concerned that additional consultations would be required as a result&nbsp;
of critical habitat. Another suggested that the Service adopt a&nbsp;
regulation that would allow the removal of the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation upon the formulation and adoption of ``a regional&nbsp;
conservation cooperative.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We recognize that critical habitat is only one of&nbsp;
many conservation tools for federally listed species. HCPs are one of&nbsp;
the most important tools for reconciling land use with the conservation&nbsp;
of listed species on non-Federal lands. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act&nbsp;
allows us to exclude from critical habitat designation areas where the&nbsp;
benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation, provided&nbsp;
the exclusion will not result in the

[[Page 9437]]

extinction of the species. We believe that in most instances the&nbsp;
benefits of excluding HCPs from critical habitat designations will&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of including them. For this designation, we find&nbsp;
that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation for&nbsp;
all legally operative HCPs issued for the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We anticipate that future HCPs in the range of the arroyo toad will&nbsp;
include it as a covered species and provide for its long term&nbsp;
conservation. We expect that HCPs undertaken by local jurisdictions&nbsp;
(e.g., counties, cities) and other parties will identify, protect, and&nbsp;
provide appropriate management for those specific lands within the&nbsp;
boundaries of the plans that are essential for the long-term&nbsp;
conservation of the species. Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act states that&nbsp;
HCPs must meet issuance criteria, including minimizing and mitigating&nbsp;
any take of the listed species covered by the permit to the maximum&nbsp;
extent practicable, and that the taking must not appreciably reduce the&nbsp;
likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild. We&nbsp;
fully expect that our future analyses of HCPs and section 10(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;
permits under section 7 will show that covered activities carried out&nbsp;
in accordance with the provisions of the HCPs and section 10(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;
permits will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat designated for the arroyo toad. As discussed above in&nbsp;
the ``Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2)'' section.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (32) Comment: Some commenters suggested that HCP exclusions should&nbsp;
include planning areas of pending HCPs and lands enrolled in the NCCP&nbsp;
program, and areas that have approved ``environmental documents, either&nbsp;
CEQA or NEPA, that have included biology reports and FWS review in&nbsp;
which'' no arroyo toads have been found. In one case, commenters&nbsp;
claimed that because the lands are already ``enrolled'' in the NCCP&nbsp;
program they are already subject to regulation, and the section 7&nbsp;
process provides enough protection in this area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: While we trust that jurisdictions will fulfill&nbsp;
their commitment to complete conservation plans, this voluntary&nbsp;
enrollment does not assure that such plans will be completed.&nbsp;
Protections for arroyo toad habitat provided through participating&nbsp;
jurisdiction's enrollment in the NCCP process are temporary and are not&nbsp;
assured; such protections may be lost if the jurisdiction elects to&nbsp;
withdraw from the NCCP program. NCCP Guidelines direct habitat loss to&nbsp;
areas with low long-term conservation potential that will not preclude&nbsp;
development of adequate NCCP plans and ensure that connectivity between&nbsp;
areas of high habitat value will be maintained.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (33) Comment: Some commenters stated that the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat removes incentives to participate in NCCP, HCP and&nbsp;
Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) processes, in part because it is&nbsp;
impossible to provide assurances needed to participate in such&nbsp;
processes following the designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The designation of critical habitat should not&nbsp;
deter participation in the NCCP or HCP processes. Approvals issued&nbsp;
under these processes include assurances of no additional mitigation&nbsp;
through the HCP No Surprises regulation (63 FR 8859). The development&nbsp;
of new HCPs or NCCPs or any SAMPs should not be affected by designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat primarily because the Service views the standards&nbsp;
of jeopardy for listed species and of adverse modification for critical&nbsp;
habitat as being virtually identical. We discuss these standards in&nbsp;
detail in the section in this document entitled ``Critical Habitat''&nbsp;
and in our response to Comment 53.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (34) Comment: One commenter said we should rely on the Corps' 404&nbsp;
program, protections under section 7 of the Act, and enrollment in the&nbsp;
NCCP program to protect the arroyo toad and its habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Please see comment (35) for our response to the&nbsp;
section 7 issue, and comment (31) for enrollment in the NCCP program.&nbsp;
The Corps, section 404 program does not address impacts to upland&nbsp;
habitat except in a very few cases and thus does not assure protection&nbsp;
for such upland areas essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (35) Comment: Some commenters suggested that, as with lands covered&nbsp;
by an HCP, the Service should exclude from critical habitat lands&nbsp;
covered by a biological opinion issued as a result of consultation&nbsp;
under section 7 of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: HCPs typically provide for greater conservation&nbsp;
benefits to a covered species by assuring the long-term protection and&nbsp;
management of a covered species and its habitat, and funding for such&nbsp;
management through the standards found in the 5-Point Policy for HCPs&nbsp;
(64 FR 35242), the HCP No Surprises regulation (63 FR 8859), and&nbsp;
relevant regulations governing the issuance and implementation of HCPs.&nbsp;
However, such assurances are typically not provided in connection with&nbsp;
Federal projects subject to section 7 consultations which, in contrast&nbsp;
to activities on non-Federal lands covered by HCPs, often do not commit&nbsp;
to long-term special management or protections. Thus, a consultation&nbsp;
unrelated to an HCP typically does not accord the lands it covers the&nbsp;
extensive benefits an HCP provides.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (36) Comment: One commenter stated that the 1.5 kilometer upland&nbsp;
habitat distance is inconsistent with the 1 km distance in approved&nbsp;
HCPs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The 1.5 km extent for upland habitat is the&nbsp;
maximum distance we used in describing the habitat in which the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements are most likely to be found. Because the&nbsp;
elevational limit of 25 m (80 ft) above the stream bed takes&nbsp;
precedence, the 1.5 km limit is less than 2 percent of the areas&nbsp;
designated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (37) Comment: Some commenters stated that surveys for the San Diego&nbsp;
MSCP were conducted at a scale (at the landscape level rather than the&nbsp;
parcel level) that makes it inappropriate to equate the protections&nbsp;
afforded through the HCP process to those afforded through the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat. One commenter stated that areas within&nbsp;
the MSCP planning area should be included in critical habitat, as there&nbsp;
are no special management considerations or protections for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad in this area. That commenter also stated that, currently, the only&nbsp;
measures proposed are control of non-native predators and human impacts&nbsp;
and that area-specific management directives were to have been&nbsp;
developed by July 1998, but those tasks have not been done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: There are several implications to these comments.&nbsp;
The first is the implication that the landscape scale is not&nbsp;
appropriate for determining areas that should be protected for the&nbsp;
arroyo toad. The second is that the critical habitat evaluation was&nbsp;
conducted at a parcel level. The third implication is that critical&nbsp;
habitat provides for a higher standard of conservation and protection&nbsp;
than HCPs and the accompanying section 7 consultations, and the fourth&nbsp;
is that the provisions of the MSCP do not provide adequate protection&nbsp;
for the arroyo toad and its habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSCP planning effort utilized the best scientific information&nbsp;
available. Survey information included both landscape level scale for&nbsp;
vegetation mapping and habitat evaluation modeling and parcel specific&nbsp;
information, where available, on known locations of species, including&nbsp;
the arroyo toad. Both the development of the recovery plan and drafting&nbsp;
of the proposed critical habitat designation evaluated existing known&nbsp;
toad populations and remaining toad habitat in a landscape context. It&nbsp;
would be

[[Page 9438]]

infeasible to evaluate critical habitat on a parcel-by-parcel basis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act states that HCPs must meet issuance&nbsp;
criteria, including minimizing and mitigating any take of the listed&nbsp;
species covered by the permit to the maximum extent practicable, and&nbsp;
that the taking must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the&nbsp;
survival and recovery of the species in the wild. Section 7 prohibits&nbsp;
actions funded, authorized, or carried out by Federal agencies from&nbsp;
jeopardizing the continue existence of a listed species or destroying&nbsp;
or adversely modifying the listed species' critical habitat. Actions&nbsp;
likely to ``jeopardize the continued existence'' of a species are those&nbsp;
that would appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and&nbsp;
recovery of a listed species. Actions likely to result in the&nbsp;
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat are those that&nbsp;
would appreciably reduce the value of critical habitat for both the&nbsp;
survival and recovery of the listed species. Common to both definitions&nbsp;
is an appreciable detrimental effect on both survival and recovery of a&nbsp;
listed species. Given the similarity of these definitions, actions&nbsp;
likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical&nbsp;
habitat would almost always result in jeopardy to the species&nbsp;
concerned. The MSCP requires a Framework Management Plan and Area&nbsp;
Specific Management Plans for preserved lands. These plans must address&nbsp;
both species-specific requirements and preserve management. Therefore,&nbsp;
we believe that the arroyo toad will be adequately served by the MSCP&nbsp;
without the designation of critical habitat.

Issue 6: Economic impacts and analysis; other relevant impacts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (38) Comment: Some commenters felt that critical habitat should not&nbsp;
have been proposed before an economic and other relevant impacts&nbsp;
analysis was completed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.19, we are not required to&nbsp;
conduct an economic analysis at the time critical habitat is initially&nbsp;
proposed. We published the proposed determination in the Federal&nbsp;
Register (65 FR 36512), invited public comment, and held two public&nbsp;
hearings. We evaluated and used comments received on the proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat to develop the draft economic analysis, as&nbsp;
appropriate. On November 9, 2000 (65 FR 67334), we published a notice&nbsp;
in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the draft&nbsp;
economic analysis and reopening the public comment period for 30 days.&nbsp;
We were unable to provide a longer comment period given the short time&nbsp;
frame ordered by the Court. In making this final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, we used the economic analysis and took into consideration&nbsp;
comments and information submitted during the public hearings and&nbsp;
public comment periods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (39) Comment: One commenter stated that we made an inappropriate&nbsp;
finding of less than $100 million impact before completing the economic&nbsp;
analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: In the proposed rule, we made a preliminary&nbsp;
finding that the economic impact of the critical habitat designation&nbsp;
would be less than $100 million. This preliminary finding was made&nbsp;
pursuant to Executive Order 12866, which requires that for significant&nbsp;
regulatory actions, the issuing agency shall assess the potential costs&nbsp;
and benefits of the regulatory action. The executive order defines&nbsp;
significant regulatory actions, in part, as rulemakings that have an&nbsp;
annual effect on the economy of $100 million or greater. The Office of&nbsp;
Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the Office of Management and&nbsp;
Budget, is required to review all significant rulemakings. We based our&nbsp;
preliminary finding in the proposed rule on our experience with similar&nbsp;
critical habitat designations because, at the time of proposal, our&nbsp;
economic analysis had not yet been finalized.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the proposed rule, under the discussion of the Small&nbsp;
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), we noted that we&nbsp;
would conduct an economic analysis to determine if the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation would have a significant effect on a substantial number of&nbsp;
small entities. As discussed above, in response to comment (38), we&nbsp;
developed and made available for public review a draft economic&nbsp;
analysis. In this draft economic analysis we concluded that the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation as proposed would result in an economic&nbsp;
impact of less than $1 million, significantly below the $100 million&nbsp;
threshold in Executive Order 12866. Our draft economic analysis also&nbsp;
concluded that our proposed rule would not have a significant effect on&nbsp;
a substantial number of small entities in part because the analysis&nbsp;
found that the proposed rule would have an overall insignificant effect&nbsp;
on the local and regional economies where critical habitat was being&nbsp;
proposed. Based on this draft economic analysis, public comment, and&nbsp;
our changes to the proposal, including reducing the acreage included&nbsp;
and the stream length of many units, we made our final determination&nbsp;
required under Executive Order 12866 that the economic impact of this&nbsp;
final critical habitat designation will be less than $100 million and&nbsp;
under SBREFA that the final rule would not have a significant economic&nbsp;
effect on a substantial number of small entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (40) Comment: Several commenters were concerned that our proposed&nbsp;
rule did not include a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and felt that&nbsp;
the economic analysis was incorrect to assume that a Regulatory&nbsp;
Flexibility Analysis was not required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended by the&nbsp;
SBREFA, generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory&nbsp;
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to the notice and comment&nbsp;
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute&nbsp;
unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant&nbsp;
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We are&nbsp;
certifying that this rule will in fact not have a significant economic&nbsp;
impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, we&nbsp;
do not need to prepare either an initial or final regulatory&nbsp;
flexibility analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have based our finding on the fact that this rule will not&nbsp;
result in any significant additional burden to the regulated community,&nbsp;
regardless of the size of the entity. Our economic analysis identified&nbsp;
several potential impacts associated with critical habitat designation,&nbsp;
including increased consultation costs, project modification costs, and&nbsp;
potential temporary decreases in property values. However, because we&nbsp;
have only designated property that is within the geographic range&nbsp;
occupied by the arroyo toad, and because the arroyo toad is already&nbsp;
federally listed, other Federal agencies are already required to&nbsp;
consult with us on activities that they authorize, fund, permit, or&nbsp;
carry out that have the potential to jeopardize the species. Any&nbsp;
associated costs related to these consultations, including project&nbsp;
modifications, will therefore be attributable to the listing of the&nbsp;
species and not to designation of critical habitat. In a few instances,&nbsp;
completed (or near-complete) consultations may have to be reinitiated&nbsp;
once the critical habitat designation is finalized to ensure Federal&nbsp;
agencies' responsibilities under section 7 are met; as a result, the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation could result in an economic effect&nbsp;
associated with any delays to complete these consultations. Most&nbsp;
decreases in property values, to the extent that they can be attributed&nbsp;
to the arroyo toad and result from actual restrictions on land use,&nbsp;
would be a result of its listing and not because of

[[Page 9439]]

critical habitat designation. We recognize that the market response to&nbsp;
a critical habitat designation, due to the perception of an increased&nbsp;
regulatory burden, may lower real estate values on lands within the&nbsp;
designation; however, we expect this decrease in value to be temporary.&nbsp;
Our draft and final economic analyses further discuss how we arrived at&nbsp;
our conclusion regarding impacts to small entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (41) Comment: One commenter suggested we review an economic&nbsp;
analysis of the California gnatcatcher critical habitat designation&nbsp;
commissioned by the law offices of Nossaman, Guthner, Knox and Elliott,&nbsp;
LLP, representing The Transportation Corridor Agencies, Forest Lawn&nbsp;
Memorial-Park Association, and other interested parties, that reported&nbsp;
the estimated economic impacts attributable to designating critical&nbsp;
habitat for the gnatcatcher could result in impacts between $300&nbsp;
million and $5.5 billion. According to the study, critical habitat&nbsp;
designation will impact between 1 to 5 percent of future expected&nbsp;
growth in the area. Another commenter submitted an economic analysis of&nbsp;
critical habitat designation commissioned by the law offices of&nbsp;
Nossaman, Guthner, Knox, and Elliott LLP, representing the Foothill/
Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency and the Raymond Basin Management&nbsp;
Board, that reported estimated economic impacts attributable to&nbsp;
designating critical habitat for the arroyo toad could result in&nbsp;
impacts between $117 million and $875 million. According to the study,&nbsp;
critical habitat designation will impact from 1 to 7.5 percent of&nbsp;
future expected growth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The first referenced document was prepared in&nbsp;
response to the gnatcatcher critical habitat and is not specifically&nbsp;
relevant to this designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad.&nbsp;
We have reviewed the second economic study cited, prepared by Dr.&nbsp;
Janczyk, of Empire Economics, on behalf of the commenter; we disagree&nbsp;
with the study's conclusions and the approach used to derive the&nbsp;
estimates discussed in the comment. The author (Dr. Janczyk) asserts&nbsp;
that critical habitat designation will impact future planned growth in&nbsp;
Southern California between 1 and 7.5 percent. This mistaken assertion&nbsp;
appears to be based on several biological opinions cited in the report&nbsp;
pertaining to the least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus),&nbsp;
southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), and the&nbsp;
California desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) (Service 1997a, b, c).&nbsp;
We believe the analysis is faulty because of the author's reliance on&nbsp;
these few biological opinions to support his assertion that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation will affect future planned growth, while ignoring&nbsp;
the thousands of other biological opinions that have allowed proposed&nbsp;
projects without separate mitigation requirements for critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the Tequesquite Landfill Flood Protection Levee project&nbsp;
biological opinion (Service 1997a) to estimate the impacts of&nbsp;
designating critical habitat for the arroyo toad is inappropriate for&nbsp;
two reasons. First, this opinion addressed impacts to the least Bell's&nbsp;
vireo and the southwestern willow flycatcher, not the arroyo toad.&nbsp;
Second, the ratios used in that opinion are in keeping with those&nbsp;
employed for projects affecting wetland/riparian habitats along the&nbsp;
Santa Ana River, regardless of occupancy by listed species and/or&nbsp;
inclusion within critical habitat. As a result, the unfortunate choice&nbsp;
of words in this opinion linking mitigation ratios and critical habitat&nbsp;
for two riparian birds should not be used as a predictor of future&nbsp;
consultations involving arroyo toad critical habitat. (For additional&nbsp;
detail concerning this biological opinion, see 65 FR 63680, October 24,&nbsp;
2000.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the second biological opinion, the author fails to note&nbsp;
that this opinion was developed in response to the BLM's request for a&nbsp;
programmatic opinion regarding desert tortoise critical habitat.&nbsp;
Specifically, the opinion reflects the thresholds proposed by the BLM&nbsp;
as to what types of impacts would trigger section 7 re-initiations,&nbsp;
with which we agreed (see Service 1997b, page 2: ``To ensure that&nbsp;
significant amounts of desert tortoise habitat are not disturbed under&nbsp;
this biological opinion, the BLM proposes to track the cumulative&nbsp;
amount of habitat disturbed by small actions and to reinitiate formal&nbsp;
consultation should habitat loss reach 10 acres per year in desert&nbsp;
tortoise critical habitat within a recovery unit''). To date, this&nbsp;
standard has not resulted in reinitiation, suggesting insignificant&nbsp;
economic impacts to the region.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author's analysis also references a third biological opinion&nbsp;
(1-8-97-F-46), again related to the desert tortoise, along with the&nbsp;
BLM's and California Department of Fish and Game's (Department)&nbsp;
California Statewide Desert Tortoise Management Policy (BLM and&nbsp;
Department 1992), which the author believes supports his assertion that&nbsp;
we place higher mitigation requirements on impacts affecting critical&nbsp;
habitat. In referring to these documents, two pertinent issues are&nbsp;
ignored. First, as stated above, the BLM, not the Service, proposed the&nbsp;
mitigation requirements. The compensation policy was issued by the BLM&nbsp;
in 1991, three years before we proposed and designated critical habitat&nbsp;
for the desert tortoise. Again, to quote our biological opinion,&nbsp;
``Compensation for affected desert tortoise habitat will be based on&nbsp;
Bureau-designated categories for areas within the California Desert&nbsp;
Conservation Area, designated critical habitat within the Mojave&nbsp;
National Preserve and Nevada, and additional Bureau guidance in&nbsp;
Nevada'' (Service 1997c).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study also ignores the fact that the National Park Service&nbsp;
(NPS) included compensation as part of the proposed action, and&nbsp;
proposed that compensation ratios for affected critical habitat be&nbsp;
based on those ratios used for the BLM's Category 1 habitat (Service&nbsp;
1997c). The proposal additionally included, as project mitigation, off-
site compensation by AT&amp;T for unavoidable impacts to desert tortoise&nbsp;
habitat in the areas of cable removal. Critical habitat for the desert&nbsp;
tortoise largely overlaps the BLM's Category I and II habitats.&nbsp;
Consequently, if we had not designated critical habitat for the desert&nbsp;
tortoise, the NPS would have required compensation based on the formula&nbsp;
and maps developed years earlier by the BLM and other agencies.&nbsp;
Critical habitat for the desert tortoise was not the ultimate&nbsp;
determining factor for the compensation ratios included in the NPS's&nbsp;
request for formal consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author also cites an article by Houck (1993) which he believes&nbsp;
supports his claim that we impose greater mitigation obligations where&nbsp;
critical habitat is present. Contrary to the author's assertion, Houck&nbsp;
found, in a review of over 71,560 informal and 2,000 formal&nbsp;
consultations that were conducted under the Act, only 18 projects that&nbsp;
were ultimately terminated. In other words, out of all the activities&nbsp;
that we consulted on, less than 0.03 percent of projects were&nbsp;
terminated (Houck 1993, p. 318). Furthermore, of 99 jeopardy opinions&nbsp;
issued by the Service, we issued ``reasonable and prudent&nbsp;
alternatives'' in nearly all of these opinions that allowed the&nbsp;
projects to proceed (Houck 1993, p. 319). Houck found that ``(T)he few&nbsp;
opinions that did not identify such alternatives involved small-scale,&nbsp;
private development directly in habitat essential to the species&nbsp;
(although not always designated as critical). No major public activity,&nbsp;
nor any major federally-permitted private activity was blocked'' (Houck&nbsp;
1993, p.320). Houck also reported that a common theme in all the&nbsp;
jeopardy opinions that he reviewed was our determination to find an&nbsp;
alternative within the economic means, authority,

[[Page 9440]]

and ability of the applicant that would allow the project to proceed&nbsp;
(Houck 1993, p.320).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also aware of several other more recent studies to support&nbsp;
our assertion that critical habitat designation has had an&nbsp;
insignificant effect on local economies. Recently, a study commissioned&nbsp;
by the Coalition for Sonoran Desert Protection examined the impact of&nbsp;
designating habitat for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl in southern&nbsp;
Arizona (McKenney 2000). Performed one year after the designation, the&nbsp;
study found that dire predictions made by developers in that region&nbsp;
have not materialized. Specifically, high-density housing development&nbsp;
has not slowed, the value of vacant land has risen, land sales have&nbsp;
continued, and the construction sector has continued its steady growth.&nbsp;
Similarly, another study that analyzed the effects of logging&nbsp;
curtailments for the northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest&nbsp;
found that it had an insignificant effect on the region's economic&nbsp;
growth (Niemi et. al. 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, we believe that the available evidence supports our&nbsp;
assertion that, in general, critical habitat designation has not caused&nbsp;
any significant impact on future economic growth and would reach the&nbsp;
same conclusion with regard to the proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (42) Comment: Several commenters stated that the draft economic&nbsp;
analysis is wrong to assume that all of the areas proposed as critical&nbsp;
habitat are ``occupied'' by the arroyo toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The determination of whether or not proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat is within the geographic range occupied by the toad is&nbsp;
part of the biological decision-making process and lies beyond the&nbsp;
scope of an economic analysis. For a discussion of the biological&nbsp;
justification of why we believe the area being designated is within the&nbsp;
geographical area occupied by the toad, see our response to Comment 4.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (43) Comment: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
inadequately analyzes the effect that other pre-existing regulations&nbsp;
may have (especially regulations implementing the California&nbsp;
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)) if critical habitat is designated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree with this assertion. Our economic&nbsp;
analysis discusses the effect that existing State and local regulations&nbsp;
have on current activities in proposed critical habitat units.&nbsp;
Specifically, CEQA requires identification of significant environmental&nbsp;
effects of proposed projects that have the potential to harm the&nbsp;
environment. The lead agency (typically the California State agency in&nbsp;
charge of the oversight of a project) must determine whether a proposed&nbsp;
project would have a ``significant'' effect on the environment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 15065 of Article 5 of the CEQA regulations states that a&nbsp;
finding of significance is mandatory if the project will&nbsp;
``substantially reduce the habitat of a fish and wildlife species,&nbsp;
cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining&nbsp;
levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the&nbsp;
number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened&nbsp;
species, or eliminate important examples of the major periods of&nbsp;
California history or prehistory.'' If the lead agency finds a project&nbsp;
will cause significant impacts, the landowners must prepare an&nbsp;
Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Any economic impacts identified by&nbsp;
the EIR process are due to the presence of a particular species on the&nbsp;
project land, regardless if it is designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review of the CEQA statute and conversations with the California&nbsp;
Resources Agency (one of the agencies responsible for administering&nbsp;
CEQA) revealed that, when a species is known to occupy a parcel of&nbsp;
land, the designation of critical habitat alone does not require a lead&nbsp;
agency to pursue any incremental actions. In the case of the arroyo&nbsp;
toad, the recovery plan made available to the public a description of&nbsp;
the habitat areas essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad.&nbsp;
Therefore, economic impacts generated by CEQA on arroyo toad habitat&nbsp;
areas are part of the baseline and not attributable to the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat. Furthermore, because the Service has only proposed&nbsp;
occupied habitat as critical habitat, the effects of the designation&nbsp;
are minimal to non-existent due to the existing requirement on Federal&nbsp;
agencies to ensure that current and future land-use activities do not&nbsp;
jeopardize the toad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (44) Comment: One commenter stated that the economic analysis was&nbsp;
flawed because while, in their opinion, the economic analysis provided&nbsp;
a methodology for reviewing economic impacts of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, it did not actually analyze the impacts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree with the commenter that the economic&nbsp;
analysis failed to analyze the economic impacts of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. The analysis first identifies the potential impacts that&nbsp;
may be associated with critical habitat designation in a general&nbsp;
framework and then discusses actual expected impacts by critical&nbsp;
habitat units and by land use activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (45) Comment: One commenter stated that the Service must not rely&nbsp;
on the public to provide information concerning the potential impacts&nbsp;
of critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: In conducting our economic analysis, we relied on&nbsp;
data and information provided by the Service, other Federal land&nbsp;
management and consulting agencies, and State and local government&nbsp;
officials. Our draft economic analysis acknowledged that predicting the&nbsp;
number and type of future section 7 consultations that could be&nbsp;
attributed to critical habitat designation was difficult, even with the&nbsp;
input provided by these sources, and consequently, while we attempted&nbsp;
to measure the effect of proposed critical habitat designation, we&nbsp;
invited public comment that could provide us with more specific&nbsp;
information that would allow us to make better estimates. Our document&nbsp;
states that the Service will consider all comments submitted on the&nbsp;
draft economic analysis and would revise estimates, as appropriate,&nbsp;
based on any additional data provided by the public. However, it does&nbsp;
not solely rely on the public to provide us with the information needed&nbsp;
to make an adequate determination of proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (46) Comment: One commenter stated that the economic analysis did&nbsp;
not consider potential costs under section 10 of the Act that may be&nbsp;
created as a result of the critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The Service must internally consult, pursuant to&nbsp;
section 7(a)(2) of the Act, on the issuance of any section 10(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;
permit. The effects of permit issuance on critical habitat must be&nbsp;
considered in the consultation. We do not anticipate that designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat would add to the costs of a section 10(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;
permit. First, section 10(a)(1)(B) permits address incidental take; the&nbsp;
Act does not address the take of critical habitat. Although we must&nbsp;
consider the effects of permit issuance on critical habitat, we believe&nbsp;
that the jeopardy standard for listed species and the adverse&nbsp;
modification standard for critical habitat are virtually identical and&nbsp;
would not therefore result in additional costs to the applicant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, one of the functions of critical habitat is to inform the&nbsp;
public of areas that may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection. Regardless of the designation of critical habitat, the&nbsp;
Service must ensure that the issuance of any section 10(a)(1)(B) permit&nbsp;
does not compromise the survival and recovery of any listed species.&nbsp;
This process includes

[[Page 9441]]

identifying key areas that are necessary to ensure the conservation of&nbsp;
the listed species, which we would do whether or not critical habitat&nbsp;
has been designated. Viewed in this sense, the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat is another tool for identifying key areas. We also encourage&nbsp;
applicants to allow us to participate as much as possible in the&nbsp;
development of applications for section 10(a)(1)(B) permits so we can&nbsp;
identify and conserve these key habitat areas, whether or not they have&nbsp;
been designated as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (47) Comment: One commenter stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
failed to consider costs incurred by other Federal agencies as a result&nbsp;
of critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree. Our estimates for costs associated&nbsp;
with future section 7 consultations that may be attributable to&nbsp;
critical habitat designation does include costs that may be incurred by&nbsp;
the Federal action agencies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (48) Comment: Several commenters stated that we should have&nbsp;
quantified potential property value effects and that the economic&nbsp;
analysis incorrectly assumes that development projects will continue&nbsp;
despite any incremental costs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Our economic analysis acknowledged that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation may, in some instances, have short-term effects on&nbsp;
private property values. However, as we stated in the analysis, we did&nbsp;
not attempt to quantify such effects due to their highly speculative&nbsp;
nature, lack of real observable data, and propensity to likely have&nbsp;
offsetting effects. Since we conducted the draft economic analysis, a&nbsp;
study was released by the Coalition for Sonoran Desert Protection that&nbsp;
examined the impact of designating habitat for the cactus ferruginous&nbsp;
pygmy-owl in southern Arizona. Performed one year after the&nbsp;
designation, the study found that dire predictions made by developers&nbsp;
in that region have not materialized. Specifically, high-density&nbsp;
housing development has not slowed, the value of vacant land has risen,&nbsp;
land sales have continued, and the construction sector has continued&nbsp;
its steady growth. We similarly believe that critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for the toad will also not likely exert any real influence&nbsp;
on real estate development within the critical habitat areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (49) Comment: Some commenters stated that we should have estimated&nbsp;
the cumulative effect of the critical habitat designation for the toad&nbsp;
along with the effect of future pending and proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
for other species in the area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are not required to estimate the cumulative&nbsp;
effect of multiple critical habitat designations as part of our&nbsp;
rulemaking procedures. We are required to consider only the effect of&nbsp;
the proposed government action, which in this case is the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat for the arroyo toad. The appropriate baseline to&nbsp;
use in an analysis of a Federal action, which in this case is the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad, is the way the&nbsp;
world would look absent the proposed regulation. Against this baseline,&nbsp;
we attempt to identify and measure the incremental costs and benefits&nbsp;
associated with the government action. Because the toad is already a&nbsp;
Federally protected species, any effect this listing has on the&nbsp;
regulated community is considered part of the baseline scenario, which&nbsp;
remains unaffected by our critical habitat designation. Future pending&nbsp;
and proposed critical habitat designation for other species in the area&nbsp;
will be part of separate rulemakings and, their economic effects will&nbsp;
be considered separately.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (50) Comment: Some commenters were concerned that, while we&nbsp;
discussed impacts that are more appropriately attributable to the&nbsp;
listing of the toad than to the proposed designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat, we did not include in the baseline costs attributable to the&nbsp;
listing or provide quantified estimates of the costs associated with&nbsp;
the listing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We do not agree that the economic impacts of the&nbsp;
listing should be considered in the economic analysis for the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat. The Act is clear that the listing&nbsp;
decision be based solely on the best available scientific and&nbsp;
commercial data available (section 4(b) of the Act). Congress also made&nbsp;
it clear in the Conference Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to&nbsp;
the Act that ``economic considerations have no relevance to&nbsp;
determinations regarding the status of species.'' If we were to&nbsp;
consider the economic impacts of listing in the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation analysis it would lead to confusion, because the&nbsp;
designation analysis is meant to determine whether areas should be&nbsp;
excluded from the designation of critical habitat based solely upon the&nbsp;
costs and benefits of the designation, and not upon the costs and&nbsp;
benefits of listing a species. Additionally, because the Act&nbsp;
specifically precludes us from considering the economic impacts of the&nbsp;
listing, it would be improper to consider those impacts in the context&nbsp;
of an economic analysis of the critical habitat designation. Our&nbsp;
economic analyses address how the actions we are currently considering&nbsp;
may affect current or planned activities and practices; they do not&nbsp;
address impacts associated with previous Federal actions, which in this&nbsp;
case includes the listing of the toad as an endangered species. This&nbsp;
method is consistent with the standards published by the Office of&nbsp;
Management and Budget for preparing economic analyses under Executive&nbsp;
Order 12866.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (51) Comment: Several commenters believed that the economic&nbsp;
analysis underestimated potential future section 7 consultations with&nbsp;
other Federal agencies and questioned how we developed our estimates.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Section 7 of the Act requires other Federal&nbsp;
agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out&nbsp;
by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of&nbsp;
any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or&nbsp;
adverse modification of critical habitat. To develop the estimate of&nbsp;
potential future section 7 consultations that may be attributable to&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, Service personnel were first asked to&nbsp;
identify, for each critical habitat area, current and potential future&nbsp;
land-use activities. In some cases we also contacted various Federal,&nbsp;
State, and local representatives to clarify our understanding of some&nbsp;
of these activities. Service personnel were then asked to consider how&nbsp;
these activities affect the listed species and their habitat. For those&nbsp;
activities that may affect a species or its habitat, we attempted to&nbsp;
determine whether or not a Federal nexus existed that could lead to a&nbsp;
section 7 consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incremental section 7 consultations were then estimated based on&nbsp;
previous consultation histories in the area. In areas for which&nbsp;
consultation had already occurred, we looked at the potential that such&nbsp;
a consultation would need to be reinitiated if critical habitat is&nbsp;
designated. For other areas where activities had not yet been the&nbsp;
subject of consultation, we estimated potential future section 7&nbsp;
consultations likely attributable to critical habitat designation based&nbsp;
on the presence of the toad and other listed species in the area, the&nbsp;
likelihood of a Federal nexus, and the likelihood that a Federal agency&nbsp;
would need to consult on such an activity based on the concerns of&nbsp;
Service personnel along with the section 7 consultation history in the&nbsp;
vicinity of the proposed critical habitat areas. In developing our&nbsp;
estimates, we contacted personnel in other Federal agencies that have&nbsp;
conducted section 7 consultations with the Service, or may in the&nbsp;
future,

[[Page 9442]]

for their opinions on how critical habitat designation may or may not&nbsp;
affect their perceived need to consult on current and future&nbsp;
activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (52) Comment: Some commenters believe that the draft economic&nbsp;
analysis underestimated the potential costs of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: In preparing the economic analysis, we made an&nbsp;
honest attempt to estimate the potential effects from critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. As previously stated, we believe that many of the effects&nbsp;
perceived by the public to be attributable to critical habitat would&nbsp;
actually occur regardless of a critical habitat designation because the&nbsp;
toad is a Federally protected species. Because we are attempting to&nbsp;
estimate potential future effects from critical habitat designation,&nbsp;
our estimates are based on potential future activities that are typical&nbsp;
for the area. In reality, some individuals may experience impacts&nbsp;
greater than we estimated, while others experience less. We were only&nbsp;
able to identify the types of impacts likely to occur regarding the&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat designation. The potential impacts we&nbsp;
identified that could result include new or reinitiated section 7&nbsp;
consultations, and perhaps some prolongment of ongoing consultations to&nbsp;
address critical habitat concerns, as required under section 7 of the&nbsp;
Act. In some cases, it is possible that we might suggest reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent alternatives to the proposed activity that triggered the&nbsp;
consultation, which would also be an impact. Also associated with&nbsp;
consultations is the length of time required to carry out&nbsp;
consultations, which may result in costs associated with project&nbsp;
delays.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognize that in some instances, the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat could result in a distorted real estate market because&nbsp;
participants may incorrectly perceive that land within the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation is subject to additional constraints. In truth,&nbsp;
this is not the case because critical habitat designation for the toad&nbsp;
does not add any extra protection, nor impact landowners beyond that&nbsp;
associated with the listing of the species under the Act. As a result,&nbsp;
we believe that any resulting distortion will be temporary and have a&nbsp;
relatively insignificant effect on the real estate market as it should&nbsp;
become readily apparent to market participants that critical habitat&nbsp;
for the toad does not impose any additional constraints on landowners&nbsp;
beyond those associated with the species' listing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (53) Comment: Some commenters disagreed with the assumption applied&nbsp;
in the economic analysis that the designation of critical habitat will&nbsp;
cause no impacts above and beyond those caused by the listing of the&nbsp;
species within occupied habitat and that ``adverse modification'' and&nbsp;
``jeopardy'' are different, will result in different impacts, and&nbsp;
should be analyzed as such in the economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree with the commenters' assertion that&nbsp;
``jeopardy'' and ``adverse modification'' represent materially&nbsp;
different standards. Section 7 prohibits actions funded, authorized, or&nbsp;
carried out by Federal agencies from jeopardizing the continued&nbsp;
existence of a listed species or destroying or adversely modifying the&nbsp;
listed species' critical habitat. Actions likely to ``jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence'' of a species are those that would appreciably&nbsp;
reduce the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed&nbsp;
species. Actions likely to result in the destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat are those that would appreciably&nbsp;
reduce the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery&nbsp;
of a listed species. Common to both definitions is an appreciable&nbsp;
detrimental effect on both survival and recovery of a listed species.&nbsp;
Given the similarity of these definitions, actions likely to result in&nbsp;
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat would&nbsp;
almost always result in jeopardy to the species concerned, particularly&nbsp;
within the geographic area occupied by the toad and that has already&nbsp;
been identified in the recovery plan as essential habitat. Furthermore,&nbsp;
we believe that other Federal agencies are aware of our concern for the&nbsp;
toad within these areas and, as a consequence, the designation of&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat will not result in any appreciable increase&nbsp;
in section 7 consultations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (54) Comment: One commenter stated that the economic analysis did&nbsp;
not address the economic impacts that critical habitat designation&nbsp;
would have on regional water authorities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree with this comment, and believe that&nbsp;
the economic analysis does address the potential effects that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation could have on regional water authorities. We&nbsp;
specifically identified water authorities that are already consulting&nbsp;
with us, as well as those that may need to consult in the future. We&nbsp;
also discuss the estimates of future section 7 consultations in the&nbsp;
economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (55) Comment: Several commenters requested that we consider the&nbsp;
economic and other benefits of reducing development, and to keep in&nbsp;
mind the identified beneficial uses of water in the designated&nbsp;
drainages. They noted additional benefits of the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, such as reducing urban run-off, purifying run-off ,&nbsp;
allowing riparian vegetation to recover, and protecting recharge areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Critical habitat designation only has the&nbsp;
potential to benefit watershed drainages if it somehow affects either&nbsp;
current or planned uses of the area under the ``without critical&nbsp;
habitat'' baseline scenario. In most instances, we do not believe that&nbsp;
critical habitat designation for the arroyo toad will have any&nbsp;
significant effect on land use activities or management practices and,&nbsp;
as a result, we believe that the designation will also have limited&nbsp;
economic or environmental benefits above the listing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (56) Comment: Some commenters stated that the proposal focuses on&nbsp;
agriculture as causing problems for the arroyo toad when, in reality,&nbsp;
predation and roadkill are the biggest threats to the arroyo toad, and&nbsp;
the Service is ignoring those. One commenter questioned our statements&nbsp;
that agriculture has had negative effects on the arroyo toad and its&nbsp;
habitat, and another stated that ongoing farm and ranch practices&nbsp;
should be exempt from regulation. In particular, some commenters&nbsp;
implied that the critical habitat designation would cripple the&nbsp;
agricultural industry. Specifically, one commenter stated that&nbsp;
agricultural revenue in affected counties is $7.8 billion when a 5:1&nbsp;
multiplier is applied, and that this output is placed at risk by the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We agree that predation by non-native species is&nbsp;
a significant threat to arroyo toads. However, we disagree with the&nbsp;
assertion that it has been or is at this time the greatest threat to&nbsp;
the continued survival of the species. We have acknowledged the&nbsp;
problems of predation or roadkill, and do not think that the proposal&nbsp;
is solely focused on the issue of agriculture. All three topics are&nbsp;
discussed extensively in the recovery plan, which we reference numerous&nbsp;
times in this final rule. Historically, the greatest impacts to arroyo&nbsp;
toad populations have been the construction of dams and the&nbsp;
accompanying water management practices. More recently, intensive&nbsp;
agriculture and urbanization have contributed greatly to the loss,&nbsp;
degradation, and fragmentation of arroyo toad habitat. We received no&nbsp;
new information during the public comment period to contradict this&nbsp;
finding. Sand and gravel mining, improper livestock management&nbsp;
practices, suction dredge mining, the invasion of non-native plant&nbsp;
species, human recreational activities,

[[Page 9443]]

and non-native predators, combined with the losses of habitat, are&nbsp;
significant threats to the species. The exact role each plays in the&nbsp;
persistence of any given population varies depending on the presence&nbsp;
and magnitude of each of the other threats. We are aware of the threat&nbsp;
of predation by non-native species, and are working with several land&nbsp;
management agencies to decrease the numbers of bullfrogs and non-native&nbsp;
fish found in many watersheds. Simultaneously, we are working with the&nbsp;
same and other agencies to reduce the impacts from water and livestock&nbsp;
management practices, recreational activities, sand and gravel mining,&nbsp;
roads, and non-native plants. The Service takes a multidisciplinary,&nbsp;
multi-pronged, ecosystem level approach to the management of endangered&nbsp;
species and their habitats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We disagree that the entire agricultural revenue stream is&nbsp;
jeopardized, as the areas proposed for critical habitat do not cover&nbsp;
the entire landscape in any county in which it is proposed, nor most of&nbsp;
the agricultural land in those counties. Additionally, by designating&nbsp;
critical habitat for the arroyo toad we are not precluding any lands&nbsp;
from being farmed now or in the future. We do not exert any influence&nbsp;
over land-use decisions on private property conducted by non-Federal&nbsp;
government entities, unless such action results in a take of a&nbsp;
federally listed species or requires a Federal action. As most&nbsp;
agriculture in the counties in which critical habitat is designated for&nbsp;
the arroyo toad occurs on private, not Federal, lands, there will be&nbsp;
very limited effects on agriculture overall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (57) Comment: The designation of critical habitat for the arroyo&nbsp;
toad will have a serious negative effect on the ability of the building&nbsp;
industry to meet the demand for affordable housing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are aware that some of the land that we have&nbsp;
proposed as critical habitat for the arroyo toad faces significant&nbsp;
development pressure. Development activities can have a significant&nbsp;
effect on the land and the species dependent on the habitat being&nbsp;
developed. We also recognize that many large-scale development projects&nbsp;
are subject to some type of Federal nexus before work actually begins.&nbsp;
As a result, we expect that future consultations, in part, will include&nbsp;
planned and future real estate development.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However it is very unlikely that these resulting consultations will&nbsp;
take place solely in regard to critical habitat issues. While it is&nbsp;
certainly true that development activities can adversely affect&nbsp;
designated critical habitat, we believe that our future consultations&nbsp;
regarding new housing development will take place because such actions&nbsp;
have the potential to adversely affect a federally listed species. Such&nbsp;
planned projects would require a section 7 consultation regardless of&nbsp;
the critical habitat designation. Section 7 of the Act requires Federal&nbsp;
agencies to consult with us whenever actions they fund, authorize, or&nbsp;
carry out can jeopardize a listed species or adversely modify its&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (58) Comment: One commenter was concerned because of the perceived&nbsp;
effect of critical habitat on implementation of the Southern California&nbsp;
Association of Governments (SCAG) regional transportation plans.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Because we have determined that the lands&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat are within the geographic range occupied&nbsp;
by the arroyo toad, this designation does not present any significant&nbsp;
additional regulatory burdens upon Regional transportation projects&nbsp;
beyond those attributable to the listing of the arroyo toad as a&nbsp;
federally endangered species. Consequently, we do not believe that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad adds any&nbsp;
significant additional economic burden within critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries. In some cases, where an existing consultation is completed,&nbsp;
a conference opinion has not been completed, the project not yet&nbsp;
implemented, and the Federal action agency retains discretion (or such&nbsp;
discretion is provided by law), agencies may need to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation to address possible impacts to critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (59) Comment: Some commenters asked why the burden of past losses&nbsp;
is put upon those now undertaking activities in remaining arroyo toad&nbsp;
habitat, or expressed the concern that certain groups of people are&nbsp;
being unfairly targeted by the designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are sensitive to the concerns of the&nbsp;
commenters, and encourage them and other parties to contact us to&nbsp;
discuss specific issues. The intent of Congress in enacting the&nbsp;
Endangered Species Act was to slow or halt the declines in the&nbsp;
distributions and numbers of numerous species. These losses were most&nbsp;
often due to habitat loss or degradation. Congress and the Act&nbsp;
recognized the importance of both species and the ecosystems they&nbsp;
depend on, and put in place prohibitions and mechanisms to recover&nbsp;
those species at the risk of extinction. In many cases the agencies&nbsp;
responsible for past losses of arroyo toads and their habitat have been&nbsp;
required to alter their management practices to reduce direct losses of&nbsp;
toads and to restore habitat to stabilize and expand existing&nbsp;
populations. These include Federal agencies such as the Department of&nbsp;
Defense and the Forest Service, as well as local agencies such as water&nbsp;
districts. We are designating lands owned by Federal, State, and local&nbsp;
agencies, as well as private lands in a wide variety of land use&nbsp;
situations. No one landowner, land use category, or business category&nbsp;
was focused on when we were selecting critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (60) Comment: Exemption of roads, homes, and shopping centers is&nbsp;
improper and discriminatory, in that it provides for different&nbsp;
standards in evaluating urban versus rural uses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We do not discriminate between projects or&nbsp;
actions that are ``rural'' in nature, versus those that are ``urban''&nbsp;
in nature. As described elsewhere in this final rule, existing&nbsp;
developments that no longer contain or support the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements do not meet the criteria for critical habitat. In many cases,&nbsp;
such development occurred before the species was listed. Federal&nbsp;
agencies are not required to conference or consult with us until a&nbsp;
species is proposed or listed, respectively. Development and activities&nbsp;
that have taken place since the listing of the arroyo toad were&nbsp;
reviewed and evaluated, as appropriate, under sections 7 and 10 of the&nbsp;
Act. If a project or action was determined to be likely to have an&nbsp;
effect on arroyo toads, a biological opinion or incidental take permit&nbsp;
(the latter accompanied by an HCP) was issued. Such opinions and&nbsp;
permits contain terms and conditions designed to avoid and minimize the&nbsp;
adverse effects to the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (61) Comment: One commenter expressed concern about possible&nbsp;
closures of fly-fishing waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We do not anticipate that any areas will be&nbsp;
closed solely because they now fall within designated critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries. Current closures of areas inhabited by arroyo toads were&nbsp;
made for several reasons. Some closures were to protect the toad and&nbsp;
its habitat solely on the basis of the listing, others were due to&nbsp;
generalized habitat degradation from recreational or other activities,&nbsp;
some were triggered by massive landslides during the most recent El&nbsp;
Nino events (1997-1998), and others were due to fires.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (62) Comment: Some landowners expressed concern about how critical&nbsp;
habitat designation may affect their particular properties, what they&nbsp;
would and would not be allowed to do in the future because of the&nbsp;
designation, and whether they would need to seek

[[Page 9444]]

incidental take authorization from us for every type of action taken on&nbsp;
their property.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are sensitive to the concerns of individuals&nbsp;
concerning their property rights. The designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
for the arroyo toad does not impose any additional requirements or&nbsp;
conditions on property owners beyond those imposed by the listing of&nbsp;
the arroyo toad as a federally endangered species, nor does it&nbsp;
establish a refuge, wilderness, reserve, preserve, or other special&nbsp;
conservation area. All landowners, public and private, are responsible&nbsp;
for making sure their actions do not result in the unauthorized taking&nbsp;
of a listed species, regardless of whether or not the activity occurs&nbsp;
within designated critical habitat. Take is defined by regulation to&nbsp;
include ``significant habitat modification or degradation that actually&nbsp;
kills or injures wildlife,'' which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court&nbsp;
in Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon et al. v.&nbsp;
Babbitt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, all Federal agencies are responsible to ensure that&nbsp;
the actions they fund, permit or carry out do not jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of a listed species, regardless of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. ``Jeopardize the continued existence of'' means to engage&nbsp;
in an action that reasonably would be expected, either directly or&nbsp;
indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of survival and&nbsp;
recovery of a listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction,&nbsp;
numbers or distribution of that species (50 CFR 402.02). Because we&nbsp;
designated only areas within the geographic range occupied by the toad,&nbsp;
any activity that would result in an adverse modification of the toad's&nbsp;
critical habitat would virtually always also jeopardize the continued&nbsp;
existence of the species. Federal agencies must consult with us,&nbsp;
pursuant to section 7 of the Act, on all activities that will adversely&nbsp;
affect the toad both within and outside of designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (63) Comment: The designation of critical habitat constitutes a&nbsp;
taking by the Federal Government, and makes the government financially&nbsp;
liable for losses in property values or due to prohibition of&nbsp;
activities within the designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the&nbsp;
rule does not have significant takings implications. A takings&nbsp;
implication assessment is not required. As discussed above, the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat affects only Federal agency actions.&nbsp;
The rule will not increase or decrease the current restrictions on&nbsp;
private property concerning take of the arroyo toad. Due to current&nbsp;
public knowledge of the species' protection, the prohibition against&nbsp;
take of the species both within and outside of the designated areas,&nbsp;
and the fact that critical habitat provides no incremental&nbsp;
restrictions, we do not anticipate that property values will be&nbsp;
affected by the critical habitat designation. While real estate market&nbsp;
values may temporarily decline following designation, due to the&nbsp;
perception that critical habitat designation may impose additional&nbsp;
regulatory burdens on land use, we expect any such impacts to be short&nbsp;
term. Additionally, critical habitat designation does not preclude&nbsp;
development of HCPs and issuance of incidental take permits. Landowners&nbsp;
in areas that are included in the designated critical habitat will&nbsp;
continue to have the opportunity to utilize their property in ways&nbsp;
consistent with the survival of the arroyo toad. Activities such as&nbsp;
gold mining or recreational activities that occur within critical&nbsp;
habitat are more likely to be restricted due to direct impacts to&nbsp;
arroyo toads, rather than any incremental restrictions due to the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (64) Comment: One commenter stated that private sector uses of&nbsp;
public lands should continue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Properly managed activities, whether on private&nbsp;
or public lands, by private individuals or companies or by public&nbsp;
agencies, can have varying levels and types of effects on arroyo toads&nbsp;
and their habitat. It is incumbent on all of these entities to ensure&nbsp;
that their activities do not take toads, either directly or indirectly,&nbsp;
and Federal agencies must ensure that their activities do not destroy&nbsp;
or adversely modify designated critical habitat. The Service is&nbsp;
available to provide technical assistance to agencies and landowners in&nbsp;
determining the most appropriate methods for avoiding take of arroyo&nbsp;
toads and other listed species. If it is likely that take of arroyo&nbsp;
toads or adverse effects to the critical habitat will occur, then it is&nbsp;
incumbent on Federal agencies to enter into the consultation process.&nbsp;
If it is likely that take of arroyo toads will occur on non-Federal&nbsp;
lands without a federal nexus, then the project proponent should apply&nbsp;
for an incidental take permit under section 10(A)(1)(b) of the Act. In&nbsp;
most cases of private activities on public lands, there will be few, if&nbsp;
any, additional terms and conditions due to the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat, as the presence of the arroyo toad itself makes it necessary&nbsp;
for Federal agencies to consult with us before they issue permits for&nbsp;
such activities. If we did not reach a jeopardy conclusion during the&nbsp;
original consultation, it is highly unlikely that the reinitiation of&nbsp;
consultation will result in a destruction or adverse modification&nbsp;
conclusion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (65) Comment: We received a request that critical habitat be&nbsp;
limited to publicly owned occupied habitat only.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: The Act requires us to identify, and if prudent,&nbsp;
to designate those habitats that are essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the species and that may require special management, regardless of&nbsp;
ownership. As we discuss in the section entitled Criteria Used to&nbsp;
Identify Critical Habitat, we guided our selection of areas for&nbsp;
designation, in part, by the information and analyses in the arroyo&nbsp;
toad recovery plan. This plan identified rivers and streams where the&nbsp;
protection and management of the toad and its habitat are necessary to&nbsp;
achieve recovery goals. Once lands are identified as essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the species, we may designate or exclude areas based on&nbsp;
economic and other impacts. While some lands have been excluded from&nbsp;
this final designation, no single category of land ownership may be&nbsp;
automatically excluded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (66) Comment: Some commenters believe that the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will encourage the conversion of private farms and&nbsp;
ranches to urban development, and that farms and ranches should be&nbsp;
exempt from designation, as these land uses preserve open space and&nbsp;
prevent conversion to urban development.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We disagree with this comment. There are numerous&nbsp;
programs available through the Fish and Wildlife Service and other&nbsp;
Federal agencies to assist farmers and ranchers in developing&nbsp;
appropriate management plans for lands that harbor threatened and&nbsp;
endangered species, both where critical habitat is designated and where&nbsp;
it is not. For example, the Landowner Incentive Program, provides funds&nbsp;
for land management activities undertaken through Safe Harbor&nbsp;
agreements. Such agreements provide assurances to landowners that&nbsp;
additional regulatory burdens will not be placed upon them as a result&nbsp;
of increased populations of listed species or the attraction of listed&nbsp;
species to appropriately managed habitat. Numerous organizations can&nbsp;
provide funding, technical assistance, and management oversight for&nbsp;
lands on which conservation agreements have been established. We invite&nbsp;
farmers and ranchers to continue to work with us and other agencies and&nbsp;
organizations to ensure that imperiled species will have the space they&nbsp;
need, farmers and ranchers will be able to retain their way

[[Page 9445]]

of life, and open space will not be lost to industrial and urban&nbsp;
development.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (67) Comment: The Service must perform a complete analysis of&nbsp;
cumulative impacts from current and planned development, mining&nbsp;
operations, and other activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We are not required to estimate the cumulative&nbsp;
effects of critical habitat designations as part of our rulemaking&nbsp;
procedures. We are required to only consider the effect of the proposed&nbsp;
government action, which in this case is the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the arroyo toad. The appropriate baseline to use in an&nbsp;
analysis of a Federal action is the way the world would look absent the&nbsp;
proposed regulation. Against this baseline, we attempt to identify and&nbsp;
measure the incremental costs and benefits associated with the&nbsp;
government action. Because the toad is already a federally protected&nbsp;
species, any effects the listing has on the regulated community is&nbsp;
considered part of the baseline scenario, which remains unaffected by&nbsp;
our critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (68) Comment: One commenter indicated that the lower end of&nbsp;
Bautista Creek (Unit 9)--from T5S, R1E Section 21 upstream to T5S, R1E&nbsp;
Section 27--was not appropriate for critical habitat designation&nbsp;
because the creek in this area flows first through a large debris basin&nbsp;
and then into a concrete lined channel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We have examined maps and photos of this area and&nbsp;
determined that it is not essential habitat for conserving the arroyo&nbsp;
toad. The critical habitat boundaries on Bautista Creek have been&nbsp;
modified to exclude areas downstream of the center of Section 27.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (69) Comment: Several commenters suggested that the segment of the&nbsp;
Whitewater River (Unit 22) below where the Colorado River Aqueduct&nbsp;
crosses the river is not appropriate for critical habitat because of&nbsp;
frequent water releases from the aqueduct into the river at this&nbsp;
location to transport water to groundwater recharge basins in the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: We have examined the situation in this area and&nbsp;
determined that portions of the Whitewater River below the Colorado&nbsp;
River Aqueduct crossing are not essential habitat for conserving the&nbsp;
arroyo toad. The critical habitat boundaries on the Whitewater River&nbsp;
have been modified to exclude areas downstream of the aqueduct.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (70) Comment: One commenter stated that it is not appropriate to&nbsp;
consider Baker Canyon occupied by arroyo toads based on recent survey&nbsp;
information and requested that we delete Baker Canyon from proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service response: Robert Fisher observed and collected an arroyo&nbsp;
toad within Baker Canyon in 1985 (R.N. Fisher, pers. comm.), and high-
quality arroyo toad habitat still exists in this area. During 1997,&nbsp;
surveys conducted at the Santiago Creek/Baker Canyon confluence did not&nbsp;
detect the presence of arroyo toads (Harmsworth Associates 1998).&nbsp;
However, this survey effort did not cover much of the area proposed as&nbsp;
critical habitat, nor did it cover the area where the toad was observed&nbsp;
in 1985. Reportedly, more comprehensive survey efforts within lower&nbsp;
Baker Canyon during 2000 also failed to detect arroyo toads (Adrian&nbsp;
Wolf, pers. comm.). Again, it is likely that portions of the area&nbsp;
proposed as critical habitat were not covered by this effort, nor have&nbsp;
the results been provided to us for our review. In many areas, breeding&nbsp;
habitat conditions in 2000 were poor (e.g., dry stream courses) because&nbsp;
of two consecutive years of below normal rainfall in southern&nbsp;
California, leading to depressed arroyo toad breeding activity. During&nbsp;
such conditions, we have found that protocol surveys can be ineffective&nbsp;
at detecting arroyo toads, even in areas of known occupancy. Although&nbsp;
it is possible that Baker Canyon is presently not occupied by arroyo&nbsp;
toads, we regard this portion of critical habitat as essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the arroyo toad based on the need to safeguard a viable&nbsp;
arroyo toad population within the Santa Ana Mountain portion of the&nbsp;
species' range.

Summary of Changes From Proposed Designation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on a review of public comments received on the proposed&nbsp;
determination of critical habitat for the arroyo toad, we re-evaluated&nbsp;
our proposed designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad. This&nbsp;
resulted in several significant changes that are reflected in this&nbsp;
final determination. These include: (1) A reduction in the minimum&nbsp;
mapping unit for defining critical habitat boundaries, (2) the&nbsp;
truncation of some stream reaches based on a determination that certain&nbsp;
lands are not essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad or that&nbsp;
such lands do not need special management, and (3) the exclusion under&nbsp;
section 4(b)(2) of Camp Pendleton because the designation would&nbsp;
significantly impair critical, ongoing training and related operations.&nbsp;
A more detailed discussion of each of these issues follows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We refined the minimum mapping unit for the designation, from the 1&nbsp;
km square grid cells used in the proposed rule to 250 m grid cells (\1/
16\th the size of 1 km cells), so that lands essential to arroyo toad&nbsp;
conservation are more precisely identified. We then superimposed the&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries on digital orthophoto quarter-quadrangle&nbsp;
(DOQQ) imagery and to remove from critical habitat urban or developed&nbsp;
areas that are not essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad.&nbsp;
The final critical habitat designation covers 73,780 ha (182,360 ac), a&nbsp;
reduction of 62 percent from the proposal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on our evaluation of information received during the comment&nbsp;
periods and site visits made to some of the proposed units, we reduced&nbsp;
the extent of some of the stream reaches proposed as critical habitat.&nbsp;
These changes were based on determinations that certain lands are not&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the arroyo toad or that such lands do&nbsp;
not need additional special management. Specifically, we reduced the&nbsp;
extent of the designated stream reaches in Unit 1, San Antonio River,&nbsp;
Monterey County; Unit 2, Sisquoc River, Santa Barbara County; Unit 6,&nbsp;
Upper Santa Clara River, Los Angeles County; Unit 9, San Jacinto River&nbsp;
and Bautista Creek, Riverside County; Unit 17, San Vicente Creek, San&nbsp;
Diego County; Unit 20, Little Rock Creek, Los Angeles County; and Unit&nbsp;
22, Whitewater River, Riverside County. The specifics for each unit are&nbsp;
given below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Unit 1, the San Antonio River on Fort Hunter Liggett in&nbsp;
Monterey County, we reduced the northern extent of the stream reach,&nbsp;
which reduced the critical habitat unit by 1,300 ha (3,210 ac). The&nbsp;
habitat in and adjacent to the reach from Forest Creek to just above&nbsp;
Mission Creek is of lower quality than that of the remaining 27 km&nbsp;
stretch of the river that is included. While the reach may provide&nbsp;
breeding habitat for arroyo toads in years when other stretches are&nbsp;
fully occupied, we do not believe it is essential to the recovery of&nbsp;
the arroyo toad in the Northern Recovery Unit. If arroyo toads do occur&nbsp;
there, the Army will have to conduct any activities in accordance with&nbsp;
terms and conditions that will be established under a new programmatic&nbsp;
biological opinion covering ongoing training, operations, and&nbsp;
maintenance activities. The Army has opened discussions with us on&nbsp;
their existing programmatic opinion, and recently submitted a draft&nbsp;
management plan for the arroyo toad. When these documents are&nbsp;
completed, the Service, if time and funding permit, will reassess the&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries in light of the plans. Until such time, we&nbsp;
believe

[[Page 9446]]

the needs of the toads on Fort Hunter Liggett still require special&nbsp;
management.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 2, the Sisquoc River in Santa Barbara County, we eliminated&nbsp;
the lower portion of the river, from the confluence with the Santa&nbsp;
Maria River to just below the confluence with La Brea Creek. This&nbsp;
reduced the critical habitat unit by 4,300 ha (10,625 ac). We have very&nbsp;
little information on arroyo toads in this area, and much of the&nbsp;
habitat has been altered by ongoing agricultural and mining practices.&nbsp;
We believe sufficient high-quality habitat is available in the&nbsp;
remaining 3,385 ha (8,360 ac) of river and upland habitat to enable the&nbsp;
stabilization and expansion of the arroyo toad population in this&nbsp;
drainage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 6, the Upper Santa Clara River basin, we have made&nbsp;
substantial changes. Unit 6a has remained the same on the maps,&nbsp;
although the description has changed to correct inaccuracies in the&nbsp;
proposed rule. A large portion of the proposed Unit 6b, including the&nbsp;
mainstem of the river and the lower portion of San Francisquito Creek,&nbsp;
has been eliminated, reducing the critical habitat unit size by 7,000&nbsp;
ha (17,300 ac). The remaining portions are identified in this final&nbsp;
rule as Unit 6b (Castaic Creek) and Unit 6c (San Francisquito Creek).&nbsp;
We believe that, under the Natural River Management Plan (NRMP)&nbsp;
(Valencia Company 1998), the river and creek will continue to function&nbsp;
as a dispersal corridor for arroyo toads between Castaic Creek to San&nbsp;
Francisquito Creek. We incorporated this area in the proposal to&nbsp;
provide for such a corridor. We believe the geomorphology and natural&nbsp;
hydrologic regime (deep sandy sediments with generally subsurface flow&nbsp;
for much of the rearing period), coupled with human activities and&nbsp;
changes, have precluded the establishment and maintenance of a breeding&nbsp;
population. We do not believe it is in the best interests of the arroyo&nbsp;
toad and other listed species to focus recovery efforts for the toad on&nbsp;
the mainstem of the river. As the NRMP and associated conservation&nbsp;
easements will not allow actions or activities that would impede&nbsp;
migration, we believe that this area has sufficient special management&nbsp;
in place. Castaic Creek upstream of the confluence with the Santa Clara&nbsp;
River and San Francisquito Creek upstream of the NRMP boundary do not&nbsp;
have adequate conservation easements or special management plans in&nbsp;
place to provide adequately for arroyo toads in these areas. As with&nbsp;
lands covered by an incidental take permit issued under section&nbsp;
10(a)(1)(B) and accompanying HCPs, if these areas are, in the future,&nbsp;
protected with conservation easements or other management plans that do&nbsp;
adequately address the needs of the toads, the Service will reassess&nbsp;
the critical habitat boundaries in light of the easements and plans.&nbsp;
The Service will try to undertake this review when the easement or plan&nbsp;
is approved, but funding constraints may influence the timing of such a&nbsp;
review. However, such agreements can proceed without a concurrent&nbsp;
amendment to the critical habitat designation should all parties agree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 9, San Jacinto River/Bautista Creek, we removed the lower 2&nbsp;
km (1.2 mi) stretch of Bautista Creek because it is channelized and no&nbsp;
longer supports breeding habitat for the arroyo toad. Significant areas&nbsp;
of developed lands were excluded because of the refined mapping unit,&nbsp;
resulting in an overall reduction of about 3,660 ha (9,180 ac) in the&nbsp;
unit size. We believe the remaining 1,710 ha (4,220 ac) will provide&nbsp;
sufficient habitat for the conservation of the arroyo toads in this&nbsp;
unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 17, San Diego River/San Vicente Creek, approximately 5 km&nbsp;
(3 mi) of upper San Vicente Creek was removed from critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries because the creek flows through a dense residential&nbsp;
development (i.e., San Diego Country Estates) in this area and we&nbsp;
believe there is no longer sufficient upland habitat there to sustain&nbsp;
arroyo toads. Along with the reduction in areal coverage resulting from&nbsp;
the refined mapping unit, this resulted in the splitting of the&nbsp;
proposed subunit 17a into two final subunits, 17a and 17d. The total&nbsp;
reduction for this unit was approximately 3,500 ha (8,665 ac).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 19, Cottonwood Creek Basin, approximately 8 km (5 mi) of La&nbsp;
Posta Creek were removed from critical habitat because there is no&nbsp;
documentation (either recent or historic) of arroyo toads inhabiting&nbsp;
the upper part of this drainage; thus, the area is not considered to be&nbsp;
essential to the species' conservation. The unit was reduced from&nbsp;
18,000 ha (44,500 ac) in the proposed rule to 7,990 ha (19,740 ac) in&nbsp;
the final designation. However, most of that reduction can be&nbsp;
attributed to the smaller mapping unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 20, Little Rock Creek, approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) of&nbsp;
Little Rock Creek below Little Rock Reservoir, a total of 1,000 ha&nbsp;
(2,470 ac), was removed from critical habitat. Recent surveys by the&nbsp;
Forest Service have not found arroyo toads downstream of the reservoir,&nbsp;
and flow is subsurface in much of the stretch, making it unsuitable as&nbsp;
rearing habitat. If arroyo toads are found on lands under Forest&nbsp;
Service management, they will address these under appropriate&nbsp;
management guidelines. If a population does become established in this&nbsp;
area, we will reconsider the area as possible critical habitat, given&nbsp;
time and funding constraints.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Unit 22, the Whitewater River in Riverside County, we have&nbsp;
removed the segment of proposed critical habitat downstream from the&nbsp;
Colorado River Aqueduct, a stretch of approximately 3 km (2 mi). This&nbsp;
reduced the unit size by about 700 ha (1,730 ac). The area is sparse in&nbsp;
vegetative cover, channelized below Interstate 10, and subject to&nbsp;
instantaneous and random changes in water levels. Water is periodically&nbsp;
released from the Colorado River aqueduct into the Whitewater River to&nbsp;
a series of percolation ponds for the purpose of recharging the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley aquifer. The refined mapping unit eliminated&nbsp;
approximately 800 ha (1,980 ac). We believe the remaining 10 km (6 mi)&nbsp;
and 865 ha (2,150 ac) will provide sufficient habitat for the long-term&nbsp;
conservation of the arroyo toad in this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton is the Marine Corps' only&nbsp;
amphibious training base on the west coast. During the public comment&nbsp;
periods for the proposal, the Marines informed us that the designation,&nbsp;
if made final, had ``the potential to substantially degrade the&nbsp;
military capabilities of both the installation and assigned operational&nbsp;
forces.'' Because designation would significantly impair critical&nbsp;
training, we excluded Camp Pendleton from this final designation. Our&nbsp;
rationale for this exclusion is discussed in more detail in the section&nbsp;
``Exclusions under section 4(b)(2),'' above.

Economic Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to designate critical&nbsp;
habitat on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information&nbsp;
available, and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of&nbsp;
designating a particular area as critical habitat. We may exclude areas&nbsp;
from critical habitat upon a determination that the benefits of such&nbsp;
exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as critical&nbsp;
habitat. We cannot exclude such areas from critical habitat when such&nbsp;
exclusion will result in the extinction of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic effects caused by listing the arroyo toad as an endangered&nbsp;
species, and by other statutes, are the baseline against which the&nbsp;
effects of critical habitat designation are evaluated. The economic&nbsp;
analysis must then examine the incremental economic and conservation&nbsp;
effects and benefit of the

[[Page 9447]]

critical habitat designation. Economic effects are measured as changes&nbsp;
in national income, regional jobs, and household income. An analysis of&nbsp;
the economic effects of the proposed arroyo toad critical habitat&nbsp;
designation was prepared (Industrial Economics, Incorporated, 2000) and&nbsp;
made available for public review (November 9 to December 11, 2000; 65&nbsp;
FR 67334). The final analysis, which reviewed and incorporated public&nbsp;
comments, concluded that no significant economic impacts are expected&nbsp;
from critical habitat designation above and beyond that already imposed&nbsp;
by listing the arroyo toad. The most likely economic effects of&nbsp;
critical habitat designation are on activities funded, authorized, or&nbsp;
carried out by a Federal agency. The analysis examined the effects of&nbsp;
the proposed designation on: (1) Re-initiation of section 7&nbsp;
consultations, (2) length of time in which section 7 consultations are&nbsp;
completed, and (3) new consultations resulting from the determination.&nbsp;
We believe that any project that would adversely modify or destroy&nbsp;
critical habitat would also jeopardize the continued existence of the&nbsp;
species, and that reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid&nbsp;
jeopardizing the species would also avoid adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat. Thus, no appreciable regulatory burden or associated&nbsp;
significant additional costs would accrue because of critical habitat&nbsp;
above and beyond that resulting from listing. Our economic analysis&nbsp;
does recognize that there may be costs from delays associated with&nbsp;
reinitiating completed consultations after the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation is made final. There may also be economic effects due to&nbsp;
the reaction of the real estate market to critical habitat designation,&nbsp;
as real estate values may be lowered due to perceived increase in the&nbsp;
regulatory burden. However, we believe this impact will be short-term.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A copy of the final economic analysis and description of the&nbsp;
exclusion process with supporting documents are included in our&nbsp;
administrative record and may be obtained by contacting the Ventura or&nbsp;
Carlsbad offices (see ADDRESSES section).

Required Determinations

1. Regulatory Planning and Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and&nbsp;
Budget (OMB), in accordance with Executive Order 12866. OMB makes the&nbsp;
final determination under Executive Order 12866.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) This rule will not have an annual economic effect of $100&nbsp;
million or more or adversely affect an economic sector, productivity,&nbsp;
jobs, the environment, or other units of government. The arroyo toad&nbsp;
was listed as an endangered species in 1994. In fiscal years 1994&nbsp;
through 1999, the Ventura and Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Offices&nbsp;
conducted or are in the process of conducting, 27 and 55, respectively,&nbsp;
formal section 7 consultations with other Federal agencies to ensure&nbsp;
that their actions would not jeopardize the continued existence of the&nbsp;
arroyo toad. No section 10(a)(1)(B) incidental take permits for arroyo&nbsp;
toads have been issued by the Ventura office, although two HCPs are in&nbsp;
the early planning stages. The Carlsbad office has issued six HCPs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Act, critical habitat may not be adversely modified by a&nbsp;
Federal agency action; the Act does not impose any restrictions through&nbsp;
critical habitat designation on non-Federal persons unless they are&nbsp;
conducting activities funded or otherwise sponsored, authorized, or&nbsp;
permitted by a Federal agency. Section 7 requires Federal agencies to&nbsp;
ensure that they do not jeopardize the continued existence of the&nbsp;
species. Based upon our experience with the species and its needs, we&nbsp;
conclude that any Federal action or authorized action that could&nbsp;
potentially cause an adverse modification of the proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat would currently be considered as ``jeopardy'' under the Act&nbsp;
(see Table 3).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the designation of currently occupied areas as&nbsp;
critical habitat does not have any incremental impacts on what actions&nbsp;
may or may not be conducted by Federal agencies or non-Federal persons&nbsp;
that receive Federal authorization or funding. Non-Federal persons that&nbsp;
do not have a Federal ``sponsorship'' of their actions are not&nbsp;
restricted by the designation of critical habitat (however, they&nbsp;
continue to be bound by the provisions of the Act concerning ``take''&nbsp;
of the species).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) This rule will not create inconsistencies with other agencies'&nbsp;
actions. As discussed above, Federal agencies have been required to&nbsp;
ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of&nbsp;
the arroyo toad since the listing in 1994. The prohibition against&nbsp;
adverse modification of critical habitat is not expected to impose any&nbsp;
additional restrictions to those that currently exist in occupied areas&nbsp;
of proposed critical habitat. Because of the potential for impacts on&nbsp;
other Federal agency activities, we will continue to review this action&nbsp;
for any inconsistencies with other Federal agency actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) This rule will not materially affect entitlements, grants, user&nbsp;
fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of their recipients.&nbsp;
Federal agencies are currently required to ensure that their activities&nbsp;
do not jeopardize the continued existence of the species, and, as&nbsp;
discussed above, we do not anticipate that the adverse modification&nbsp;
prohibition (resulting from critical habitat designation) will have any&nbsp;
significant incremental effects in areas of occupied habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) This rule will not raise novel legal or policy issues. This&nbsp;
final determination follows the requirements for designating critical&nbsp;
habitat contained in the Act.

2. Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the economic analysis, we determined that designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will not have a significant effect on a substantial&nbsp;
number of small entities. As discussed under Regulatory Planning and&nbsp;
Review above and in this final determination, this rule is not expected&nbsp;
to result in any restrictions in addition to those currently in&nbsp;
existence for areas of occupied critical habitat. As indicated on Table&nbsp;
2 (see Critical Habitat Designation section), we designated property&nbsp;
owned by Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments, and private&nbsp;
property.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within these areas, the types of Federal actions or authorized&nbsp;
activities that we have identified as potential concerns are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Regulation of activities affecting waters of the United States&nbsp;
by the Army Corps under section 404 of the Clean Water Act;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Regulation of water flows, damming, diversion, and&nbsp;
channelization by any Federal agency;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Road construction and maintenance, right-of-way designation,&nbsp;
and regulation of agricultural activities on Federal lands (such as&nbsp;
those managed by the Service, Forest Service, DOD, or BLM);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Regulation of grazing, mining, and recreation by the BLM,&nbsp;
Department of Defense, Army Corps, or Forest Service;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Regulation of airport improvement activities by the Federal&nbsp;
Aviation Administration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Military training and maneuvers and, facilities operations and&nbsp;
maintenance on Fort Hunter Liggett and other applicable DOD lands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Construction of roads and fences along the international border&nbsp;
with Mexico, and associated immigration enforcement activities by the&nbsp;
INS;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Licensing of construction of communication sites by the Federal&nbsp;
Communications Commission, and;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) Funding of activities by the U.S. Environmental Protection&nbsp;
Agency, Department of Energy, Federal Emergency Management Agency,&nbsp;
Federal Highway Administration, or any other Federal agency.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the activities sponsored by Federal agencies within&nbsp;
critical habitat areas are carried out by small entities (as defined by&nbsp;
the Regulatory Flexibility Act) through contract, grant, permit, or&nbsp;
other Federal authorization. As discussed above, these actions are&nbsp;
currently required to comply with the listing protections of the Act,&nbsp;
and the designation of occupied areas as critical habitat is not&nbsp;
anticipated to have any additional effects on these activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For actions on non-Federal property that do not have a Federal&nbsp;
connection (such as funding or authorization), the current restrictions&nbsp;
concerning take of the species remain in effect, and this final rule&nbsp;
will add no further restrictions.

3. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the economic analysis, we determined whether designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat would cause (a) any effect on the economy of $100&nbsp;
million or more; (b) any increases in costs or prices for consumers,&nbsp;
individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or&nbsp;
geographic regions; or (c) any significant adverse effects on&nbsp;
competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the&nbsp;
ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based&nbsp;
enterprises. Please refer to the final economic analysis for a&nbsp;
discussion of the effects of this determination.

4. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501&nbsp;
et seq.):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) This rule will not ``significantly or uniquely'' affect small&nbsp;
governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not required. Small&nbsp;
governments will be affected only to the extent that any programs&nbsp;
having Federal funds, permits, or other authorized activities must&nbsp;
ensure that their actions will not adversely affect the critical&nbsp;
habitat. However, as discussed above, these actions are currently&nbsp;
subject to equivalent restrictions through the listing protections of&nbsp;
the species, and no further restrictions are anticipated to result from&nbsp;
critical habitat designation of occupied areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) This rule will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or&nbsp;
greater in any year; that is, it is not a ``significant regulatory&nbsp;
action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat imposes no obligations on State or local governments.

5. Takings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the rule does not have&nbsp;
significant takings implications. A takings implication assessment is&nbsp;
not required. As discussed above, the designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
affects only Federal agency actions. The rule will not increase or&nbsp;
decrease the current restrictions on private property concerning take&nbsp;
of the arroyo toad. Due to current public knowledge of the specie's&nbsp;
protection, the prohibition against take of the species both within and&nbsp;
outside of the designated areas, and the fact that critical habitat&nbsp;
provides no incremental restrictions, we do not anticipate that&nbsp;
property values will be affected by the critical habitat designation.&nbsp;
While real estate market values may temporarily decline following&nbsp;
designation, due to the perception that critical habitat designation&nbsp;
may impose additional regulatory burdens on land use, we expect any&nbsp;
such impacts to be short term. Additionally, critical habitat&nbsp;
designation does not preclude development of HCPs and issuance of&nbsp;
incidental take permits. Owners of areas

[[Page 9449]]

that are included in the designated critical habitat will continue to&nbsp;
have opportunity to utilize their property in ways consistent with the&nbsp;
survival of the arroyo toad.

6. Federalism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 13132, the rule does not have&nbsp;
significant Federalism effects. A Federalism assessment is not&nbsp;
required. In keeping with Department of the Interior and Department of&nbsp;
Commerce policy, we requested information from and coordinated&nbsp;
development of this critical habitat designation with appropriate State&nbsp;
resource agencies in California. The designation of critical habitat in&nbsp;
areas currently occupied by the arroyo toad imposes no additional&nbsp;
restrictions to those currently in place and, therefore, has little&nbsp;
incremental impact on State and local governments and their activities.&nbsp;
The designation may have some benefit to these governments in that the&nbsp;
areas essential to the conservation of the species are more clearly&nbsp;
defined, and the primary constituent elements of the habitat necessary&nbsp;
to the survival of the species are specifically identified. While&nbsp;
making this definition and identification does not alter where and what&nbsp;
federally sponsored activities may occur, it may assist these local&nbsp;
governments in long-range planning (rather than waiting for case-by-
case section 7 consultations to occur).

7. Civil Justice Reform

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12988, the Office of the&nbsp;
Solicitor has determined that the rule does not unduly burden the&nbsp;
judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2)&nbsp;
of the Order. We designated critical habitat in accordance with the&nbsp;
provisions of the Endangered Species Act. The rule uses standard&nbsp;
property descriptions and identifies the primary constituent elements&nbsp;
within the designated areas to assist the public in understanding the&nbsp;
habitat needs of the arroyo toad.

8. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule does not contain any information collection requirements&nbsp;
that require OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

9. National Environmental Policy Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that we do not need to prepare an Environmental&nbsp;
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement as defined by the&nbsp;
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in connection with&nbsp;
regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. We published a&nbsp;
notice outlining our reasons for this determination in the Federal&nbsp;
Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). This final determination&nbsp;
does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the&nbsp;
quality of the human environment.

10. Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994,&nbsp;
``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments'' (59 FR 22951) E.O. 13175, and 512 DM 2, we coordinated&nbsp;
with federally recognized Tribes on a Government-to-Government basis.&nbsp;
We determined that certain Tribal lands are essential for the&nbsp;
conservation of the arroyo toad because they support essential&nbsp;
populations and habitat, and activities conducted or planned on those&nbsp;
lands may adversely affect the conservation of the arroyo toad.&nbsp;
Therefore, we are designating critical habitat for the arroyo toad on&nbsp;
some Tribal lands. Information relative to each reservation is included&nbsp;
in the critical habitat unit descriptions. We have excluded some areas&nbsp;
from critical habitat upon a determination that the lands did not meet&nbsp;
the criteria for critical habitat. The changes are detailed in the&nbsp;
Changes from the Proposed Rule section.

Relationship to Mexico

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not aware of any existing national level regulatory&nbsp;
mechanism in Mexico that would protect the arroyo toad or its habitat.&nbsp;
Although new legislation for wildlife is pending in Mexico and Mexico&nbsp;
has laws that could provide protection for rare species, there are&nbsp;
enforcement challenges. Even if specific protections were available and&nbsp;
enforceable in Mexico, the portion of the arroyo toad's range in Mexico&nbsp;
alone, in isolation, would not be adequate to ensure the long-term&nbsp;
conservation of the species.

Arroyo Toad (Bufo californicus)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Monterey, Santa&nbsp;
Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange,&nbsp;
and San Diego counties, California, on the maps below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Critical habitat includes stream and river courses, riparian&nbsp;
habitats, and adjacent terrace and upland habitats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Within these areas, primary constituent elements for the&nbsp;
arroyo toad include a hydrologic regime that supplies sufficient&nbsp;
flowing water of suitable quality at the appropriate times to&nbsp;
provide space, food, and cover needed to sustain eggs, tadpoles,&nbsp;
metamorphosing juveniles, and adult breeding toads; low-gradient&nbsp;
stream segments (typically less than 4 percent) with sandy or fine&nbsp;
gravel substrates which support the formation of shallow pools and&nbsp;
sparsely vegetated sand and gravel bars for breeding and rearing of&nbsp;
tadpoles and juveniles; a natural flooding regime or one&nbsp;
sufficiently corresponding to a natural regime that will&nbsp;
periodically scour riparian vegetation, rework stream channels and&nbsp;
terraces, and redistribute sands and sediments, such that adequate&nbsp;
numbers and sizes of breeding pools and sufficient terrace habitats&nbsp;
with appropriate vegetation are maintained to provide for the needs&nbsp;
of all life stages of the toad; upland habitats of sufficient width&nbsp;
and quality (i.e., with areas of loose, sandy soil where toads can&nbsp;
burrow underground) to provide foraging and living areas for&nbsp;
subadult and adult arroyo toads (loose, sandy soils are typically&nbsp;
most prevalent on alluvial terraces and valley bottomlands and occur&nbsp;
primarily, but not exclusively, within 1.5 km (0.9 mi) of the&nbsp;
streamcourse and less than 25 m (80 ft) in elevation above the&nbsp;
adjacent stream channel); few or no nonnative species that prey upon&nbsp;
or compete with arroyo toads, or degrade their habitat; stream&nbsp;
channels and upland habitats where manmade barriers do not&nbsp;
completely or substantially impede migration to overwintering sites,&nbsp;
dispersal between populations, or recolonization of temporarily&nbsp;
unoccupied areas that contain suitable habitat; and habitats free&nbsp;
of, or with limited levels of, land use activities that&nbsp;
substantially reconfigure stream channels, remove or impede the&nbsp;
deposition of sand and gravel deposits, compact soils, or crush&nbsp;
individual toads (see maps labeled Index 1 and Index 2 for overview&nbsp;
of proposed critical habitat).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Critical habitat does not include existing features and&nbsp;
structures, such as building, aqueducts, airports, and other&nbsp;
developed areas not containing one or more of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements.
