<ul>
<li>The name of the domain from which the visitor accesses the Internet (for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private Internet access account; “yourschool.edu” if you connect from an educational domain; or, "agency.gov" if you connect from a US government domain).</li>

<li>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) packet data. This information is used to detect malicious activity on our website.</li>

<li>Session cookie ID. This helps us determine which sequences of pages users typically view. We use this information to make the site easier to use.</li>

<li>Other cookies used to validate voluntary customer survey results.  These are of limited duration and cannot be used to identify survey participants or track their page or web site visits.</li>

<li>Visitor Display Color Depth (e.g., 32 bits, 24 bits, etc.) and Visitor Screen Resolution (e.g., 1024 x 768 pixels, 800 x 600 pixels, etc.). This information helps determine the colors and sizes of graphics and other design elements that work best on our site.</li>

<li>Number of bytes received helps determine the computer and network capacity required to make the site available to the public.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this data is retained for a minimum of 90 days to comply with federal record-keeping requirements, and then deleted. Collection and analysis of this information in the aggregate will enable us to enhance site performance, improve informational materials available on our website, and improve overall customer service.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a id="Security" name="Security">Security</a></h3>

<p>We make no attempts to identify individual users unless we suspect illegal behavior. To keep this service available and secure, we monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to add or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the website. By using this website you consent to such monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to upload information and/or change information on this website are strictly prohibited and are subject to prosecution under the <em>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986,</em> the <em>National Information Infrastructure Protection Act,</em> and <em>Title 18 USC Sections 1001</em> and <em>1030</em>.</p>

<h3><a id="Customer Surveys" name="Customer Surveys">Customer Surveys</a></h3>

<p>IRS conducts surveys by telephone, by mail and online to capture taxpayer and tax practitioner opinions and suggestions for improving our products and services. The surveys are voluntary and if you choose to participate, you and your answers remain anonymous. IRS conducts its surveys using contractors who have passed a rigid security screening process to maintain your confidentiality.<br />
<br />
It is important to remember that an IRS survey will never ask you for personal information like your Social Security Number, your Taxpayer Identification Number or any credit card or bank information. An IRS survey may ask you specific questions about your tax filing experiences, for example: <em>Did you file a Form 1040 with a Schedule C?;</em>  <em>Did you receive a notice regarding your taxes?;</em> or, <em>What is your level of satisfaction with certain IRS services?</em> If you receive a survey that requests personal information, do not participate, it could be <a href="/newsroom/article/0,,id=155682,00.html">an attempt to steal your identity</a>.<br />
<br />
All printed IRS surveys you receive in the mail will provide an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) number. IRS surveys conducted by telephone and online will provide an IRS contact person if you wish to verify the authenticity of the survey.</p>
