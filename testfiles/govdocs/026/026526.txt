     *  Vertical Computer Systems, Inc. (VCSY)
          
     The  Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of these

     obligations under Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act  of  1934
     (Exchange Act).  These orders were entered pursuant to Section 12(k)  of
     the Exchange Act.
     
     The  Commission  cautions broker-dealers, shareholders  and  prospective
     purchasers that they should carefully consider the foregoing information
     along with all other currently available information and any information
     subsequently issued by the companies.
     
     Brokers  and dealers should be alert to the fact that, pursuant to  Rule
     15c2-11  under  the  Exchange  Act, at the termination  of  the  trading
     suspension,  no quotation may be entered relating to the  securities  of
     the subject companies unless and until the broker or dealer has strictly
     complied with all of the provisions of the rule. If any broker or dealer
     is  uncertain as to what is required by the rule, it should refrain from
     entering  quotations relating to the securities of  the  companies  that
     have  been  subject to trading suspensions until such  time  as  it  has
     familiarized  itself  with  the rule and is  certain  that  all  of  its
     provisions have been met. Any broker or dealer with questions  regarding
     the  rule  should  contact  the  staff of the  Securities  and  Exchange
     Commission  in  Washington, D.C. at (202) 942-0772.  If  any  broker  or
     dealer  enters  any quotation which is in violation  of  the  rule,  the
     Commission will consider the need for prompt enforcement action.
     
     If  any  broker  dealer  or other person has any information  which  may
     relate  to  this matter, they should immediately communicate it  to  the
     Delinquent  Filings Branch of the Division of Enforcement at (202)  824-
     5460, or by e-mail at DelinquentFilings@sec.gov.  (Rel. 34-50760)
     

RULES AND RELATED MATTERS
     

ISSUER RESTRICTIONS OR PROHIBITIONS ON OWNERSHIP BY SECURITIES INTERMEDIARIES

     The  Commission  is  adopting  new Rule  17Ad-20  under  the  Securities
     Exchange  Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that prohibits registered  transfer
     agents  from  effecting any transfer of any equity  security  registered
     under  Section  12  or any equity security that subjects  an  issuer  to
     reporting under 15(d) of the Exchange Act if such security is subject to
     any  restriction  or  prohibition on transfer to or  from  a  securities
     intermediary.   Under  the rule, the term “securities  intermediary”  is
     defined  as  a  clearing  agency registered under  Section  17A  of  the
     Exchange Act or a person, including a bank, broker, or dealer,  that  in
     the  ordinary  course of its business maintains securities accounts  for
     others.   The  Commission  is excluding from  Rule  17Ad-20  any  equity
     security issued by a partnership, as defined in Item 901 of Regulation S-
     K.  The primary purpose of the proposed rule is to promote the integrity
     and   efficiency   of   the  U.S.  clearance  and   settlement   system.
     Publication  of the adoption of Rule 17Ad-20 is expected in the  Federal
     Register on December 7, 2004.  (Rel. 34-50758)

DISPOSAL OF CONSUMER REPORT INFORMATION
     
     The  Commission has adopted amendments to the rule under Regulation  S-P
     requiring  financial institutions to adopt policies  and  procedures  to
     safeguard   customer   information.   The   amendments   implement   the
     requirements of Section 216 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions
     Act  of  2003 (FACT Act), which adds new Section 628 to the Fair  Credit
     Reporting  Act.   Section  216 of the FACT Act directs  the  Commission,
     Board  of  Governors  of  the Federal Reserve  System,  Federal  Deposit
     Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office
     of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration, and Federal
     Trade Commission to coordinate with one another to adopt consistent  and
     comparable  rules regarding the disposal of consumer report information.
     The provision is designed, in general, to protect a consumer against the
     risks  associated  with  unauthorized access to  information  about  the
     consumer  contained  in a consumer report, such  as  fraud  and  related
     crimes, including identity theft.
     
     The  rule  amendments implementing Section 216 of the FACT Act apply  to
     brokers and dealers (other than brokers and dealers registered by notice
     with the Commission under Section 15(b)(11) of the Exchange Act for  the
     purpose of conducting business in security futures products), investment
     companies,  and investment advisers and transfer agents registered  with
     the  Commission.  The amendments require that any of these entities that
     possess  consumer  report  information  for  a  business  purpose   take
     reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to or use  of
     the information in connection with its disposal.
     
     The  amendments  also  require that policies and procedures  adopted  by
     entities subject to the Commission’s existing safeguard rule must be  in
     writing.   The  compliance  date for the amendments  is  July  1,  2005.
     Existing  contracts  with service providers involving  the  disposal  or
     destruction  of  consumer  report  information  must  comply  with   the
     requirements for disposing of such information by July 1, 2006.   (Rels.

COMMISSION   INSTITUTES  ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCEEDINGS  AGAINST  15  DELINQUENT
COMPANIES,  INCLUDING  6  HIGH VOLUME DELINQUENT PINK  SHEET  COMPANIES,  FOR
FAILURE TO MAKE REQUIRED PERIODIC FILINGS
     
     On   December  1,  the  Commission  instituted  three  separate   public
     administrative  proceedings  against a total  of  fifteen  companies  to
     determine  whether  the registration of each class of  their  securities
     should  be  revoked  or suspended for failure to file required  periodic
     reports.
     
     In  the  Matter  of  Abacan  Resources  Corp.,  et  al.,  Administrative
     Proceeding File No. 3-11759
     
     In  this  proceeding,  the Commission issued administrative  proceedings
     against the following issuers:
          ·    Abacan Resources Corp.
     *  Heroes, Inc.
          
     In  this Order, the Division of Enforcement alleges that the two issuers
     are  delinquent in their required periodic filings with the  Commission.
     The Division of Enforcement also alleges that each of these issuers has,
     at  times  during  the past twelve months, traded at  volumes  exceeding
     100,000 shares per day, placing them among the highest volume delinquent
     issuers quoted on the Pink Sheets.
     
     In  the  Matter  of  American Multiplexer Corp., et al.,  Administrative
     Proceeding File No. 3-11760
     
     In this proceeding, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings
     against the following issuers:

     *  American Multiplexer Corp.
     *  DMT Energy, Inc.
     *  JTS Corp.
     *  Webvan Group, Inc.
     
     In this Order, the Division of Enforcement alleges that the four issuers
     are  delinquent in their required periodic filings with the  Commission.
     The Division of Enforcement also alleges that each of these issuers has,
     at  times  during  the past twelve months, traded at  volumes  exceeding
     100,000 shares per day, placing them among the highest volume delinquent
     issuers quoted on the Pink Sheets.
     
     In  the  Matter  of  Asset  Equity Group, Inc., et  al.,  Administrative
     Proceeding File No. 3-11761
     
     In this proceeding, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings
     against the following issuers:

     *  Asset Equity Group, Inc.
     *  Household Direct, Inc.
     *  International Brands, Inc.
     *  Interspace Enterprises, Inc.
     *  JSJ Capital II, Inc.
     *  Mega Micro Technologies Group, Inc.
     *  S D E Holdings 2, Inc.
     *  Vertical Computer Systems, Inc.
     *  VSAT Net, Inc.
          
     In this Order, the Division of Enforcement alleges that the nine issuers
     are  or  were  affiliated  with either Scott  A.  Deitler,  of  Boulder,
     Colorado, or Anthony N. DeMint, of Henderson, Nevada, and that they  are
     all  delinquent in their periodic filings.  The Division of  Enforcement
     also alleges that each of these issuers failed, in whole or in part,  to
     heed  delinquency  letters sent to them by the Division  of  Corporation
     Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations  or
     did  not receive such letters because the last address on file with  the
     Commission for some of the issuers was not valid.

     In  each  of these proceedings, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j)  of
     the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), a hearing  will  be
     scheduled  before an Administrative Law Judge.  At those  hearings,  the
     judge  will  hear  evidence from the Division  of  Enforcement  and  the
     respondents  to  determine whether the allegations of  the  Division  of
     Enforcement  contained  in  the  Orders,  which  the  Division   alleges
     constitute violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-
     1  and  13a-13  thereunder,  are true.  The judge  will  then  determine
     whether  the registrations pursuant to Exchange Act Section  12  of  the
     securities  of  these  respondents  should  be  revoked,   or   in   the
     alternative, suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months.

SEC INSTITUTES SETTLED CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THOMAS TAYLOR  IN
THE KMART MATTER AND OBTAINS A PENALTY FROM TAYLOR

     The  Commission  today  instituted settled cease-and-desist  proceedings
     against  Thomas  L.  Taylor, Director of Sales for  PepsiCo’s  Frito-Lay
     division  in  charge  of  the Kmart snack account  during  the  relevant
     period.   The  Order Instituting Proceedings charges that Kmart  “pulled
     forward,”  i.e.,  recognized prematurely, millions of dollars  worth  of
     vendor  “allowances”  prior to bankruptcy with the result  that  Kmart’s
     cost  of  goods  sold  was  understated, and  earnings  were  materially
     overstated, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended Jan.  31,  2001.
     The  Order  further states that the allowances were embodied  in  Vendor
     Allowance Tracking System (VATS) forms.  According to the Order,  toward
     the  end of Kmart’s fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2001 (fiscal year  2000),
     Taylor learned that Kmart needed Frito-Lay’s help in overcoming a profit
     shortfall in the food and consumables division.  Accordingly, the  Order
     states  that Frito-Lay agreed to make a $2.8 million “space payment”  in
     January  2001.   The Order states that Taylor understood that  the  $2.8
     million  was a “pre-payment” of allowances to be earned by Kmart  during
     calendar year 2001 because he helped draft a written agreement  to  that
     effect   and   co-signed  three  VATS  forms  on  Jan.  4,  2001,   that
     misrepresented  the  effective dates of  the  allowances  as  1/1/01  to
     1/31/01.   These  VATS  forms  were entered  into  Kmart’s  computerized
     accounting  system  and  posted to the general  ledger.   As  a  result,
     Kmart’s  cost  of goods sold was understated by $2.8 million  in  fiscal
     year 2000.
     
     The  Order  charges  Taylor with violations of  Rule  13b2-1  under  the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and causing violations of
     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.
     Simultaneously with the institution of the Order, the Commission filed a
     civil action against three Kmart mid-level officers and five individuals
     from  Kmart’s vendor community, including Taylor, to collect  a  $25,000
     civil penalty from Taylor to which he agreed.  [SEC v. John Paul Orr, et
     al., Civ. 04-74702 (Roberts J.) (E.D.Michigan] (LR-18989)

FLORIDA  BOILER ROOM OPERATOR SETTLES SEC CHARGES FOR SELLING  BOGUS  LIMITED
LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
     On  Nov.  29,  2004, the Honorable Joan A. Lenard of the  U.S.  District
     Court  for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment  by
     consent  against Sara Jane Peck (Peck), a resident of Aventura, Florida.
     Without  admitting  or  denying  the  allegations  in  the  Commission’s
     complaint, Peck agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating various
     antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and
     to pay $200,000 in disgorgement. The three other defendants in the case,
     Larry  Grabarnick  (Grabarnick), Marc David Shiner (Shiner)  and  Donald
     LaBarre (LaBarre) have previously settled to judgments requiring them to
     collectively  pay over $7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment  interest
     and civil penalties.
     The  Commission's complaint alleges that Grabarnick and Shiner  promoted
     investments in unregistered LLP units to the public through bulk e-mails
     and  Internet websites. Interested investors responded over the Internet
     by  providing contact information, which Peck and LaBarre then purchased
     as  “leads” from Grabarnick and Shiner.  The complaint alleges that Peck
     and  LaBarre  used boiler room sales tactics to offer and sell  the  LLP
     units.  Investors were told they would benefit from the deregulation  of
     the  electric  service provider market in California. According  to  the
     complaint, more than 580 people nationwide invested over $10 million  by
     purchasing  units,  or  fractions  thereof,  in  eight  LLPs.  Each  LLP
     consisted of 80 partnership units, each valued at $19,675, for  a  total
     of $1,547,000 per fully funded partnership.
     According    to    the   complaint,   Peck   made   numerous    material
     misrepresentations  and  omissions to investors regarding,  among  other
     things,  the use of investor funds, the profitability of the investment,
     its likelihood of success, the risks associated with the investment, and
     the need to invest quickly.  After all 80 units were sold, or as many as
     could  be, investors were told that the partnerships would not be viable
     and they were offered Over-the-Counter penny stock in exchange for their
     remaining   escrowed  funds.  None  of  the  partnerships  ever   became
     operational  electric  companies.  Many  investors  were  elderly;  many
     rolled  over  money from IRA and 401(k) accounts.  All of the  investors
     were left with worthless partnership units and delisted penny stock.
     Peck,  without admitting or denying the allegations, settled the  action
     by  consenting  to entry of a court order that: (i) permanently  enjoins
     her  from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities  Act
     of  1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act  of
     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) requires her to pay $333,725 in
     disgorgement.  Peck has consented to pay $200,000 in disgorgement.   She
     was  not  ordered  to  pay  a civil penalty and  the  remainder  of  her
     disgorgement  obligation was waived based upon a demonstrated  inability
     to  pay  more.   [SEC  v.  Larry Grabarnick, Marc David  Shiner,  Donald
     LaBarre  and Sara Jane Peck, Case No. 02 Civ. 20875 (Leonard,  J.)  S.D.

ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS


     A  summary, entitled “DISCOVER CAPITAL HOLDINGS, DINOV BROTHERS  TO  PAY
     $706,000 IN STOCK FRAUD CASE; DINOVS BARRED FROM INDUSTRY”, included  in
     yesterday’s Digest, should have read as follows:
     
     DISCOVER CAPITAL HOLDINGS, DINOV BROTHERS TO PAY $706,000 IN STOCK FRAUD
     CASE; DINOVS BARRED FROM INDUSTRY

          On November 19, the Honorable Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S.
          District Court for the District of Columbia entered final judgments
          against  Discover Capital Holdings Corp., Indianapolis  Securities,
          Inc.,  and  Eli  and  Ari  Dinov, arising from  charges  that  they
          participated in the fraudulent, unregistered offering  of  Discover
          Capital's  preferred  shares.  Without  admitting  or  denying  the
          allegations of the Commission's complaint, Discover Capital and the
          Dinov  brothers agreed to pay a total of $706,459 in  disgorgement,
          penalties,  and prejudgment interest, including a $120,000  penalty
          imposed  on Ari Dinov.  In addition, the four defendants  consented
          to  being  permanently enjoined from violating  the  antifraud  and
          registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and Eli and
          Ari  Dinov  consented to being barred from acting  as  officers  or
          directors  of  a  public  company.   In  related  proceedings,  the
          Commission issued an administrative order on Dec. 2, 2004, to which
          Eli and Ari Dinov consented, barring them from associating with any
          broker or dealer.

          Specifically,  Discover Capital, Indianapolis  Securities  and  the
          Dinovs  consented  to  the  entry of  final  judgments  permanently
          enjoining  them  from  violating  Sections  5  and  17(a)  of   the
          Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
          Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.
          
          The Commission's complaint, filed on July 9, 2003, alleges that the
          defendants, Eli Dinov, his brother Ari Dinov, and David Rubin  used
          spam  e-mail  touts and misleading, high pressure  sales  calls  to
          raise  $1.1  million dollars through the sale of private  placement
          shares  of  Uniondale, New York-based Discover Capital,  a  company
          controlled by the individual defendants, through Discover's  wholly
          owned broker-dealer subsidiary, Indianapolis Securities.
          
          The  money  to  be  paid in connection with these final  judgments,
          together  with  the  $462,000 in disgorgement,  penalty,  and  pre-
          judgment interest which co-defendant David Rubin was ordered to pay
          in March 2004, brings the total amount to be paid by the defendants
          in  this  case  to over $1.1 million.  For further information  see
