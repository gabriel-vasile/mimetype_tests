  Just over 100 years ago, on November 9, 1903, the Honorable Joseph 
Gurney Cannon, a Republican from Illinois, was sworn in as the 34th 
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. ``Uncle Joe'' Cannon 
became, perhaps, the most powerful Speaker in the history of that 
office, exercising almost complete control over the legislative process, 
dominating the committee system, often determining the content of 
legislation, and standing toe to toe with Republican Presidents Theodore 
Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. Cannon was a colorful figure, earthy 
in appearance, demeanor, and sense of humor. He was the most prominent 
legislator of his day and perhaps, at that time, the only Member of 
Congress to gain extensive public recognition. In fact, his power in the 
House of Representatives became increasingly controversial until 
finally, on St. Patrick's Day 1910, the Members of the House rebelled 
against him, stripping him of control over the Rules Committee and 
putting the party regime that had evolved since the Civil War on the 
path of extinction.
  The speakership of the House had not always been so powerful an office 
nor such a pure expression of party interest as Cannon made it. During 
the formative years of the Republic, the political party system was in 
flux, and House Speakers were not usually cast in the role of national 
party leaders. Henry Clay of Kentucky, the most important Speaker of the 
antebellum period, was indeed a partisan figure; but his influence 
extended beyond the circle of his partisan supporters and as a national 
figure he, in effect, transcended the offices that he held. Other 
antebellum Speakers were less noteworthy. It was not until after the 
Civil War, with the rise of the stable, two-party system that we have 
known since, that the speakership became defined as a position of party 
responsibility. This development sharpened the fundamental tension 
between the Speaker's partisan and institutional roles that is latent in 
the constitutional design. From 1865 until the turn of the 20th century, 
the political parties became more entrenched and the speakership became 
an increasingly important position of party governance. Several Speakers 
during this period became powerful political leaders. These included 
Republicans James G. Blaine of Maine, Thomas B. Reed of Maine, and 
Cannon himself, and Democrats such as Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, 
John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, and Charles F. Crisp of Georgia. Clearly, 
however, Cannon was the most powerful of them all, and his speakership 
represented the apotheosis of the office. Cannon came to the speakership 
just as that office reached its zenith under the rules of the House and 
of the Republican conference. The Speaker controlled floor recognition, 
named the members of committees, chaired the Rules Committee, determined 
referral of bills to committees, and controlled the floor agenda. 
Speaker Cannon's power was made emblematic by one disgruntled GOP 
progressive Member who, when asked by a constituent for a copy of the 
rules of the House, sent a picture of the Speaker.
  Today, we remember Cannon as the Czar of the House, and the office 
building that bears his name is a monument to his power. It is equally 
important to remember, though, that Cannon's speakership witnessed the 
peak of the Speaker's powers and the beginning of their decline. The St. 
Patrick's Day revolt of 1910 stripped the Speaker of his control over 
the Rules Committee and led to the defeat of the Republican Party and of 
Cannon himself in the 1912 elections. Cannon was reelected in 1914 and 
the Republicans recaptured their House majority in the election of 1918. 
The speakership, however, was never again as powerful as it had been 
under Cannon. It is ironic that the building that bears Cannon's name 
was emblematic of an institutional shift that would, over time, erode 
the power that he had enjoyed.
  When the Cannon House Office Building was completed in 1908, it was 
the first detached office building serving the U.S. House of 
Representatives, and it symbolized, and gave further effect to, an 
underlying transformation in American politics and in the House of 
Representatives. It was at or near the beginning of the era of 
``institutionalization'' of the House.\1\ The demands of legislative 
work and constituency service had created the need for each Member of 
the House to have adequate staff and appropriate office space in which 
to operate. No longer would Members have to meet with constituents in 
the halls, lobbies, hotels, and restaurants. Henceforth, Members would 
have their own space and that space would be at some distance from the 
legislative Chamber. The first step in isolating Members from each other 
was taken out of institutional necessity.

Representatives,'' American Political Science Review, v. 62, March 1968,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Cannon House Office Building opened during a period of electoral 
realignment and the attendant sharp political conflicts. Progressive 
western Republicans allied with northern and southern Democrats to 
dislodge Cannon from the Rules Committee. When the Democrats took the 
House in 1911 their Speaker, Champ Clark of Missouri, relinquished to 
Floor Leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama control over the House floor. 
Underwood experimented with government through the Democratic Caucus 
(much to the displeasure of their erstwhile allies, the progressive 
Republicans), but eventually power flowed to the committee system where 
it remained ensconced until the reform movement of the early seventies.
  The transformation of the House from a party-centered to a committee-
centered legislative body was manifested by the construction of two 
additional office buildings. The Longworth Building, named after Speaker 
Nicholas Longworth (R-OH), was completed in 1933. The Rayburn Building 
was completed in 1965 and was named in honor of the House's longest-
serving Speaker, Sam Rayburn of Texas. These buildings were monuments to 
the power of the committees. While the Cannon Building had few committee 
hearing rooms, both the Longworth and Rayburn Buildings are organized 
around them. With the exception of the Appropriations, Rules, Standards 
of Official Conduct, and Ways and Means Committees, which today occupy 
offices in the Capitol Building, all other committees established their 
operations in the detached office buildings. The party leaders occupied 
space in the Capitol. Just as the physical layout of Washington, DC, 
reflects the constitutional separation of powers, so, too, did the 
arrangement of Capitol Hill reflect the institutional divisions between 
the party leaders and the committees and their chairs.
  The influence of political party competed with that of the committee 
system under Democratic majorities from 1911 to 1918 and under 
Republican majorities from 1919 until 1930. The Democrats experimented 
with ``King Caucus'' while diminishing the role of the Speaker. The 
Republicans managed business through a small group of legislators whose 
most influential Member was Longworth. As Speaker, Longworth 
demonstrated vestiges of the power that Cannon had enjoyed, but only 
that. Beneath the surface, a trend was already underway that would alter 
the House and the speakership for generations: longevity in service was 
steadily on the rise. This trend was especially accentuated in the 
southern States dominated by Democrats. When the Democrats returned to 
power in 1931, southern Democrats were at the top of the seniority lists 
and came to chair many key committees. The Democrats were to hold power 
for all but 4 of the next 64 years, and, until the reforms of the early 
seventies, the southerners sat astride the committees and the House like 
statues on the balustrades of an ancient castle.
  I have elsewhere labeled this the ``feudal'' era in the history of the 
speakership because of the manner in which Speakers showed deference to 
the committee chairs.\2\ There were related political and institutional 
reasons for this deference. Politically, the ascendency of the 
committees and the relative decline of the speakership was the product 
of the Democratic Party and the coalition that supported it. The 
Roosevelt coalition combined voters from northern cities with the 
``solid South.'' The quid pro quo was always implicit: the South would 
provide reliable congressional majorities and the North would leave 
civil rights alone. To ensure that this political bargain stuck, 
congressional Democrats opted for seniority as an almost inviolate rule 
for advancement up the committee lists. They granted extraordinary 
powers to the committee chairs, powers that enabled them to set the 
agenda, determine committee meeting times, cast proxy votes, name the 
subcommittees, and, in effect, control legislation. The southern barons 
could block any legislation thought inimical to southern interests. The 
Rules Committee, which had been the bastion of Cannon's power, now 
functioned autonomously and often at odds with the leadership. The Ways 
and Means Committee, whose chair had formerly served as floor leader and 
deputy to the Speaker, now functioned autonomously in controlling vital 
legislation and serving as the party's Committee on Committees. The 
speakership that Cannon knew had become unrecognizably eroded.

  This was just fine with Democratic Speakers. Their job was to preserve 
the Democrats' hold on power. This meant holding the coalition together. 
Conflict resolved or avoided in the committee rooms would not infect the 
Democratic Caucus or erupt on the House floor. It was in this context 
that Sam Rayburn became the longest-serving (and by many accounts) most 
esteemed Speaker of the House. Rayburn represented a district in a 
southern State. His obligations as a national Democrat were always in 
tension with the attitudes of his Texas constituents.\3\ Rayburn shaped 
the culture of the House of Representatives. He was both feared and 
revered by Members. Because he did not exercise active control over the 
committees, he was not held to account for their actions. At the same 
time, he was able to influence the committees when he needed to do so, 
precisely because he cultivated relationships with their chairs, his 
fellow southerners. Together, they taught a generation of new Members 
that ``to get along, go along,'' go along, that is, with Rayburn and the 
committee dons.

  This House of Representatives defined what political scientists later 
called the ``textbook Congress,'' replete with ``norms'' such as 
reciprocity, collegiality, deference, hard work, and, of course, 
seniority. These values were ingrained in Members and those who best 
adapted to them were the most likely to rise in the party hierarchy. 
Rayburn's socialization of the House even stretched across party lines. 
While the Republican Party always demonstrated a more centralized 
tendency than did the Democrats, their most senior Members rose on the 
committee rosters and learned that their best interests were served by 
embracing the Democratic system and working with its leadership. Rayburn 
developed a close friendship with Republican Leader Joseph Martin of 
Massachusetts, and, when Martin served as Speaker during the 80th (1947-
1949) and 83d (1953-1955) Congresses, he perpetuated many of the values 
that he had assimilated during his service in Rayburn's House. Rayburn 
held daily sessions in a room at the Capitol that was dubbed the ``Board 
of Education.'' Martin would join the Speaker in bending an elbow on 
bourbon and branch water while discussing the issues of the day. A 
generation of favored Democrats and Republicans assimilated bipartisan 
norms as they absorbed the Speaker's liquor.
  The ``textbook Congress'' did not last forever, indicating perhaps why 
textbooks always need to be revised. During the fifties, there arose 
increasing tension between the northern, liberal wing of the Democratic 
Party and the southern conservatives. The two Texans leading the 
Congress, Rayburn in the House and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. 
Johnson, were tugged to the left, Johnson by his Presidential ambitions, 
Rayburn by the increasingly restless liberals in the Democratic Caucus. 
When John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, he realized that the 
southern stranglehold on the House would frustrate many of his policies. 
In 1961, in the last great battle of his career, Sam Rayburn led a 
successful effort to enlarge the Rules Committee to give it a loyal 
majority. Thus, the path was cleared for the subsequent passage of the 
landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.
  After Johnson's landslide Presidential election in 1964, substantial 
liberal majorities in the House and Senate swept away southern 
opposition to enact his Great Society. Still, House liberals such as 
Richard Bolling (D-MO.) believed that the time had come to break the 
southern grip on the committee system. By the decade's end, they had 
enough votes to push through the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 
and, during the early seventies, a series of Democratic Caucus reforms 
that both strengthened the speakership and weakened the committee 
barons. The Speaker was given operating control over the Rules 
Committee. By party rule, he named the chair and the majority members of 
the committee. The Democratic Steering and Policy Committee became the 
party's Committee on Committees, and the Speaker appointed a number of 
its members. All committee chairs were to be nominated by Steering and 
Policy and ratified by the full caucus, as were the subcommittee chairs 
of the Appropriations Committee. The caucus itself met monthly, 
providing a venue for the liberal majority to express itself.
  Even as the power of the speakership was thus enhanced, that of the 
committee chairs was reduced. The Democrats pushed through a 
``subcommittee bill of rights'' that guaranteed that bills would be 
referred to the subcommittee of jurisdiction. Subcommittees were 
provided staff, budget, and jurisdiction. With a more autonomous set of 
subcommittees beneath them, and with the full caucus and its liberal 
majority hovering over them, committee chairs could no longer control 
the legislative process and dictate the content of legislation. The 
erosion of the power of the full committee chairs reached its apex in 
1975 when, led by the Watergate class of 1974, three southern committee 
chairs were deposed by the caucus. After that happened, committee chairs 
were more careful to nurture their relations with the caucus as a whole.
  The general effect of these reforms may be described in three rings. 
At the center, the party leadership, especially the Speaker, was 
empowered by these reforms. Leadership stock went up, committee chair 
stock went down. In the middle ring, power was decentralized within the 
committee system. By the late seventies, over 150 members of the 
Democratic Caucus served as subcommittee chairs. Each was granted 
considerable autonomy in managing the subcommittee's business. To 
sustain their influence, committee chairs had to negotiate relationships 
with the subcommittee chairs. Rivalries naturally developed and the 
committees became venues for bargaining and compromise. In the outer 
layer, the House floor became a more important venue. The weakened 
committee system was the subject of less deference on the floor. The 
introduction of electronic voting, in 1973, made Members more 
accountable. Televised coverage made the floor more accessible to the 
public. Issues that might once have been resolved behind the closed 
doors of the committee rooms were now settled in open floor fights. And 
the floor was leadership territory.
  Thus, the modern speakership was to operate in a very different 
legislative milieu than at any time in the history of the House. During 
the late 19th century, the Speaker was able to dominate the House. 
During most of the 20th century, the committee barons were in control. 
During the last three decades of the 20th century, the decentralization 
of power created the need for other control mechanisms. Under these 
circumstances, more power was given to the Speaker, but more was 
expected of him as well. Thrust onto center stage, House Speakers became 
more pivotal and more vulnerable. Members had higher expectations; 
political opponents had greater incentive and opportunity to cause 
mischief.
  Political scientists have written for a long time now about the 
``post-reform House.'' The term remains useful in differentiating the 
transition away from the committee-centered regime of the textbook 
Congress. By now, however, it may obscure more than it reveals. It has 
not been the reforms alone that have altered the context of the modern 
speakership. An underlying realignment has reshaped the political 
landscape that gives definition to institutional processes. The most 
obvious manifestation of this realignment is the fact that in 1994 the 
Republicans won control of the House for the first time in 40 years. As 
early as 1968, pundits had been anticipating a rightward drift in 
American politics.\4\ Barry Goldwater had prophesied it and Ronald 
Reagan had pressed it forward. Newt Gingrich completed it. The linchpin 
of this realignment has been the transition of the South from Democratic 
to Republican control. This process began with the passage of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, which drove many southern, white Democrats into the 
camp of the Republicans. This development has led us to where we are 
today. Richard Nixon carried a substantial percentage of the black vote 
in 1960. More Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act than 
Republicans. The Republican decision to seek the votes of southern 
whites had its intended effect, swinging a majority of southern 
congressional districts, Senate seats, and electoral votes to the GOP; 
but it has cost them dearly among black voters who now vote 95 percent 
for the Democrats. This racial and regional polarization meshes with 
religion and other cultural variables to shape the present narrow 
political division in the country.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The parity between the two parties shapes the political and 
institutional context of the speakership today. The reformed House had 
one set of consequences when it was run by entrenched Democrats holding 
a comfortable majority of seats most of the time. It runs differently 
when run by a narrow Republican majority determined to hold on to power 
in a protracted war for control of the House. For example, the 
relationship between the party leadership and the committees is 
fundamentally different under the Republicans than it had been under the 
Democrats. The Democratic committee chairs saw their power eroded, but 
were never dominated by the party leaders. Even when several committee 
chairs were deposed by the Democratic Caucus, the initiative came from 
within the caucus and the leadership supported the chairs. The 
Republicans have simply bypassed several senior Members as committee or 
subcommittee chairs, and have punished deviating Members by denying them 
chairs to which their seniority would have entitled them. Thus, if the 
reformed House is different from the pre-reformed House, the Republican 
House is different from the Democratic House. No matter which party is 
in the majority, the narrow division that has been in place between the 
two parties since 1995 has shaped the legislative environment in ways 
that the reformers of the early seventies could not have anticipated.
  One manifestation of this new environment is the upheaval that the 
speakership has experienced in the past 15 years. Almost a century ago, 
Uncle Joe Cannon was stripped of much of his power, defeated for 
reelection and, upon being reelected, reduced to the role of elder 
statesman within the Republican conference. During the 20th century, the 
speakership has witnessed great stability, even as its stature was in 
many ways diminished in relationship to the committee system. The reform 
movement and the development of partisan struggle for control of the 
House have created a more politicized environment than any since 
Cannon's time. This has taken a toll on the speakership. One Speaker 
resigned from office, a second was defeated for reelection, and a third 
declined to seek another term in office. These events say as much about 
the contemporary climate of American politics as they do about the 
individual Speakers.
  This inquiry into the speakership today, then, comes at a critical 
moment in the history of that office. This volume presents a variety of 
perspectives on the changing speakership. Part I provides the 
proceedings of the Cannon Centenary Conference on ``The Changing Nature 
of the Speakership,'' co-sponsored by the Congressional Research Service 
and the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center of the 
University of Oklahoma. (Funding for the conference was also provided by 
the McCormick Tribune Foundation.) The conference addressed in detail 
the speakerships of: Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill (D-MA; 1977-1987); Jim 
Wright (D-TX; 1987-1989); Tom Foley (D-WA, 1989-1993); and Newt Gingrich 
(R-GA; 1995-1999). In examining each speakership, the book offers a 
statement by the Speaker himself (or, in the case of the late Speaker 
O'Neill, by his biographer, John Farrell) along with commentary from 
Democratic and Republican Members who served with that Speaker. 
Additional insight is provided by noted historian Robert Remini, who 
traces the broad path of the speakership's evolution. Of particular note 
is the contribution of Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL; 1999-  ) who offers 
his most definitive statement on the speakership and his conduct of it 
to date.
  Part II provides additional depth of analysis in chapters arrayed 
topically. Prepared by political scientists and congressional 
specialists at the Congressional Research Service, these chapters offer 
an analytic perspective on the speakership. In Chapter 2, Walter Oleszek 
and Richard C. Sachs examine the impact of three Speakers--Reed, Cannon, 
and Gingrich--on the rules of the House. They argue that these three 
Speakers were distinctive in their proactive efforts to implement a 
fundamentally new institutional order in the House. Their account 
reminds us that Speakers are not entirely hostage to circumstance, and 
that exceptional Speakers have been able to bring about important 
institutional changes.
  Chapter 3, by Christopher Davis, surveys the history of the House 
Rules Committee and the relationships of House Speakers to it. During 
the partisan era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Rules 
Committee served as a reliable arm of the majority party leadership, and 
Speakers such as Reed and Cannon used control over the committee to push 
party legislation. With the rise of the conservative coalition in the 
late thirties, the Rules Committee assumed considerable independence, 
and became an impediment to legislation pushed by the liberal Democratic 
majority. Since the reform movement of the early seventies, Houses 
Speakers have once again taken control of the Rules Committee. The 
Republicans, who complained bitterly about the tyrannical dictates of 
the committee when in the minority have, Davis finds, been as assertive 
as the Democrats in using their control over Rules to structure floor 
debate and to shape legislation brought to the floor.
  In Chapter 4, Elizabeth Rybicki traces the relationship between the 
Speaker of the House and the leadership of the Senate. She identifies 
the key differences between the two bodies that structure this 
relationship, and examines how the role of the Speaker in bicameral 
coordination has become more challenging in the modern era. Of 
particular interest is her description of the mechanics of bicameral 
relations. Among these are the legislative conferences through which the 
two Chambers reach agreement on the final language of bills.
  Of increasing importance has been the relationship between the Speaker 
and the press, addressed by Betsy Palmer in Chapter 5. Her account 
stresses the changing relationship between House Speakers and the media, 
affected by the historical and partisan context, the personalities of 
individual Speakers, and evolving media technologies. During most of 
American history to date, Speakers had informal and sometimes personal 
relationships with a core group of press corps veterans. With the 
emergence of broadcast television, cable television, and Internet 
technologies, Speakers have had to develop more sophisticated media 
strategies to counter those of the President, Senators, and other House 
Members. The decision to open House proceedings to broader media 
coverage has changed the political environment. The increasing 
partisanship we see today echoes that of a century ago, but the 
relationship between the Speaker and the media is greatly different 
today than it was then.
  There has been no more important relationship for House Speakers than 
that which they have encountered with Presidents of the United States. 
In Chapter 6, Eric Petersen provides a template for understanding the 
Speaker-President nexus by considering the relationship between Speaker 
Cannon and President Theodore Roosevelt, on the one hand, and Speaker 
Rayburn and President Franklin Roosevelt on the other hand. In the 
former case, despite Theodore Roosevelt's efforts to court Cannon, the 
relationship was at times strained, as Speaker Cannon often disdained 
the legislative initiatives of the President. Forty years later, Speaker 
Rayburn was a pillar of support for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and 
wartime policies. In each case, however, the Speaker's relationship to 
the President was shaped by the needs and expectation of the Members of 
the House.
  Chapter 7 elaborates on the relationship between Speakers and 
Presidents by considering that relationship in the context of national 
emergencies: the Civil War, World War I, the Great Depression, and World 
War II. In it, Harold Relyea argues that times of national emergency 
affect the role of the Speaker and the relationship of the speakership 
to the Presidency. In our system of separated institutions sharing 
powers, the Presidency naturally emerges during times of national 
crisis. The Congress, in general, and the speakership, in particular, 
tends to defer to Presidential leadership. This may take the form of 
passing Presidential legislation or in acquiescing to Presidential 
actions. In such times, House Speakers tend to be supportive of Chief 
Executives. Still, relationships between Speakers and Presidents during 
national emergencies have varied due to personality, partisanship, 
ideology, institutional stature, and statesmanship.
  In the book's final chapter, I provide an overview of the many changes 
the speakership has experienced and offer a reflection on its role in 
the House today. This discussion echoes many of the specific themes 
developed by the other authors. In particular, it reinforces the 
perspective that the speakership has evolved over time according to 
underlying changes in the American political system, producing periods 
of partisan turmoil as well as periods of bipartisan stability. Speakers 
have had to adapt their leadership style to the contexts in which they 
were called upon to serve, yet each Speaker has put his stamp on the 
office. The present period is characterized by a strong partisanship not 
experienced since Uncle Joe Cannon was at the zenith of his power, a 
century ago. Whether this augurs well or ill for the House of 
Representatives, the speakership, and the country, is a story yet to be 
told.
