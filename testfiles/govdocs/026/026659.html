House Should Elect Interim Speaker
 </b></font></center>
<P><DD>                          

     Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution requires the House
of Representatives to choose a Speaker.  It is customary at the
commencement of every Congress for members of each party to vote
for the candidate decided upon by his or her caucus.  Because
governance of the House conforms to the democratic principles
which undergird our republic, there is no doubt that the votes of
the majority will determine who shall be our Speaker.
<p><DD>
     Today, however, we are choosing a presiding officer in
unprecedented circumstances.  Never before has there been an
election for Speaker in which one of the candidates stands
formally accused by the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct of violating the rules of the House.  It is not my
intention today to argue the merits of the charges against Mr.
Gingrich or what if any sanctions should be imposed.  I focus
instead on the implications of the Committee's Statement Of
Alleged Violation for today's election for Speaker, for the
Speakership as an institution, for the House of Representatives,
and for our nation itself.
<P><DD>
     The facts are these: The Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct alleges that Mr. Gingrich violated the rules of the
House.  As of this date the Committee has not completed its
consideration of the case, and no resolution has been achieved. 
When resolution does occur, it may very well involve sanctions
which make Mr. Gingrich ineligible to hold the post of Speaker.
<P><DD>
     Removal of a Speaker under those conditions would be
debilitating for the House and the nation.  It would cause chaos
within the House and further undermine public confidence in
democratic institutions.  Even if resolution of the case against
Mr. Gingrich does not result in his ineligibility for the
Speakership, his election as Speaker at this time would be
inadvisable for two reasons: (1) the time, attention and energy
he must devote to his case will diminish the personal resources
available for the discharge of his duties as Speaker of the
House; and (2) the shadow of doubt and suspicion cast by the 

proceedings against him will undoubtedly fall on every action of
the House and bring into question the integrity of this
institution.
<P><DD>
     I believe, therefore, that until the case against Mr.
Gingrich is resolved, the House should choose an interim Speaker. 
I reiterate my acknowledgement that the majority has the right to
determine who that individual shall be.  However, in order to
ensure that the business of the House is conducted in an
undistracted manner, free of doubts about the integrity of the
institution and its governance, that person should be someone not
involved in the ethical issues in which Mr. Gingrich finds
himself enmeshed.
