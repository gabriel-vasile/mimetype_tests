<P>============================================================</P>
<P><B>THIS WEEK:</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>105th Congress Convenes</B></P>
<P>The 105th Congress convened on January 7, 1996.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>1923 Precedent allows Newt Gingrich to retain Speakership</B></P>
<P>House Speaker Newt Gingrich won re-election to a new term on January 7, 1996 
over the opposition of the minority and a handful of dissident Republicans. 
Gingrich became the first Republican re-elected speaker in 68 years, however, he 
did so with less than a majority of House members casting ballots for him. 
Gingrich received 216 votes for Speaker of the House. Democratic leader Dick 
Gephardt (D-MO) had 205; Rep. Jim Leach (R-IA) had 2; former Republican leader 
Bob Michel received 1, and former Rep. Bob Walker of Pennsylvania got 1. (An 
individual may be elected Speaker without serving as a Member of Congress).</P>
<P>A total of 425 votes were cast for candidates and six members voted 
"present." Gingrich's 216 votes were a majority of those present but not a 
majority of the entire body. House parliamentarians based a decision to declare 
Gingrich the winner upon a 1923 case in which Frederick Gillett (R-MA) received 
only 215 votes but was declared the winner.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Congress Declares Clinton's Re-election</B></P>
<P>Members of the House and Senate gathered<B> </B>in a Joint Session on January 
9, 1996, to count the votes from the Electoral College and officially declared 
Bill Clinton the winner of a second term as President of the United States. 
Members of the Senate crossed the Capitol to the House chamber, bringing with 
them the sealed certificates from the Electoral College voting of December 16th. 
Vice President Al Gore, as president of the Senate, presided over the count and 
will announced the winner. The ballots were counted by two members of the Senate 
[John Warner (R-VA), and Wendell Ford (D-KY)] and two from the House [(Bill 
Thomas (R-CA) and Sam Gejdenson (D-CT)]. The outcome was 379 votes for 
Clinton/Gore and 159 votes for Dole/Kemp.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

ranking member, David Obey (D-WI), announced the appropriations subcommittee
