Despite his humble beginnings, this signer became
President of the Continental Congress and one of the most successful
businessmen and landowners in Massachusetts. At the Convention, he
chaired the committee of the whole, served on the committee of detail,
and made numerous other contributions. His fall was equally spectacular,
and he died in bankruptcy.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Gorham, an eldest child, was born in 1738 at
Charlestown, Mass., into an old Bay Colony family of modest means. His
father operated a packet boat. The youth's education was minimal. When
he was about 15 years of age, he was apprenticed to a New London, Conn.,
merchant. Quitting in 1759, he headed back to his hometown and
established a business, which quickly succeeded. In 1763 he wed Rebecca
Call, who was to bear nine children.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Gorham began his political career as a public notary,
but soon won election to the colonial legislature (1771-75). During the
Revolution, he unswervingly backed the Whigs. He was a delegate to the
provincial congress (1774-75), member of the Commonwealth's Board of War
(1778-81), delegate to the constitutional convention (1779-80), and
representative in both the upper (1780) and lower (1781-87) houses of
the legislature, including the speakership of the latter in 1781, 1782,
and 1785. In the latter year, though he apparently lacked formal legal
training, he began a judicial career as judge of the Middlesex County
court of common pleas (1785-96). During this same period, in 1788-89 he
sat on the Governor's Council.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During the war, British troops had ravaged much of
Gorham's property, though by privateering and speculation he managed to
recoup most of his fortune. Despite these pressing business concerns and
his State political and judicial activities, he also managed to serve
the Nation. He was a Member of the Continental Congress (1782-83 and
1785-87), from June 1786 until January 1787 holding the office of
President.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The next year, at age 49, Gorham attended the
Constitutional Convention. A moderate nationalist, he played an
influential part in the sessions, all of which he attended. He spoke
often, acted as chairman of the committee of the whole, and sat on the
committee of detail. As a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying
convention, he stood behind the Constitution.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Some unhappy years followed. Gorham did not serve in
the new Government he had helped to create. In 1788 he and Oliver Phelps
of Windsor, Conn., and possibly others, contracted to purchase from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 6 million acres of unimproved land in
western New York. The price was $1 million in devalued Massachusetts
scrip. Gorham and Phelps quickly succeeded in clearing Indian title to
2,600,000 acres in the eastern section of the grant and sold much of it
to settlers. Problems soon arose, however. Massachusetts scrip rose
dramatically in value, enormously swelling the purchase price of the
vast tract. By 1790 the two men were unable to meet their payments. The
result was a financial crisis that led to Gorham's insolvency&#151;and a
fall from the heights of Boston society and political esteem.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Gorham died in 1796 at the age of 58 and is buried at
the Phipps Street Cemetery in Charlestown, Mass.</P>
