              are fighting a system, and that system is the system that enables 
              the Speaker, by the power vested in him, to thwart and overthrow 
              the will of the majority membership of this House.&#148;</font></i></p>

              Oscar Underwood, March 19, 1910</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Progressive 
              movement was a reaction to the industrial and urban growth of the 
              nation during the late 19th century. It attempted to loosen the 
              hold of political machines and political corruption on state and 
              local government operations and policies. When the Progressives 
              turned their attentions to national policies, the halls of Congress 
              became an important arena for the introduction of reforms. Their 
              program included economic regulation, limits on child labor, and 
              pure food and drugs. But their goals also included breaking up strongholds 
              of power within Congress and expanding the power of voters in U.S. 
              politics.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the 
              events that signaled the triumph of Progressivism on the national 
              stage was the revolt against House Speaker Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois 
              in 1910 by a coalition of Republican Progressives and Democrats. 
              While personally popular, Speaker Cannon had become a symbol of 
              conservative or stand-pat political forces, utilizing his great 
              powers to obstruct the Progressive programs of President Theodore 
              Roosevelt and of legislators such as Senator Robert La Follette 
              of Wisconsin. The revolt against Cannon also represented the end 
              of a brief but recurring House experiment in centralizing powers 
              within the Speakership.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
