For the year 1893.</head><p>The following is an extract from the "Centennial Almanac" for the year 1893:</p><p>Mercury is the year the reigning planet.</p><p>Year In General.--Is more dry and cold than warm, and seldom fruitful.</p><p>Spring.--The end of March will be warm; April, until the 25th, dry, afterwards cold; May will have some cold days in the commencement, so that the fruit will be in danger.</p><p>Summer.--Will have a good deal of rain, by which the earth will however not be properly refreshed.  The hay and grain can be brought in pretty well, though it will be best not to delay with it.</p><p>Autumn.--In the commencement there will be a great deal of rain, and there will be early frost: but when the half of October is past, there will be dry weather, until the commencement of advent.</p><p>Winter.--After a pleasant autumn, winter will fall in suddenly in the commencement of December; it will be cold and show until February, which will appear rather mild; but from the middle on to the 4th of March it will be cold, and from thence on to the termination storms and tempests will take place.</p><p>Cultivation Of Spring Grain.--Will succeed pretty well.  It is a favorable year for barley.  Oats, peas and other leguminous plants must be sown when the ground is  neither too dry nor too wet and damp.  Hemp and flax will be good, but the hemp will remain short.</p><p>Cultivation Of Winter Grain.--Is various.

This column shows first the sign of the Zodiac in which the Moon is or enters on the day indicated, the outer row of figures indicating the degrees of the sign in which the Moon is at 12 o'clock noon.</p><p>The sixth column contains various remarkable aspects, such as the Sun's movement through the signs of the Zodiac, and when he enters each sign.  The Dragon Head (Moon's ascending node) denotes that at the time indicated the Moon is ascending <pageinfo><controlpgno>0017</controlpgno><printpgno>17</printpgno></pageinfo>crosses the path of the Sun, and the Dragon Tail (Moon's descending node) that the Moon crosses the Sun's path in descending.  The Planets, Venus and Mercury, are nearer to the Sun than the Earth, hence their orbits around the Sun are between the Sun and the path of the Earth.  Conjunctions of these two Planets with the Sun are always distinguished by the words <hi rend="italics">Inferior</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Superior</hi>. An Inferior Conjunction is one in which the Planet comes between the Sun and the Earth.  A Superior Conjunction is one in which the Planet is on the other side of the Sun.  When an Inferior Conjunction takes place at the time the Planet crosses the Path of the Sun, a Transit occurs, that is, the Planet, resembling a small black ball, may be seen to pass over the disk of the Sun.  All the other Planets can never pass between the Earth and Sun because their paths around the Sun are outside that of the Earth, and Conjunctions with them and the Sun are never distinguished by the words <hi rend="italics">Inferior</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Superior</hi>.  When any of the outer Planets come in Conjunction with the Sun, the Planet is always on the other side of the Sun.  The inhabitants of the outer Planets will see Inferior Conjunctions of the Earth and the Sun, and when one of these Planets passes in a straight line with the Earth and the Path of the Sun, the inhabitants of that planet can see the Earth, looking like a small black ball, pass over the disk of the Sun, just as we see, at rare intervals, transits of Venus and Mercury.  The Moon passes through all the sighs of the Zodiac every month, and Conjunctions of the Moon with any of the Planets are also noted in the 6th column.  For example:  On the 9th January we find the Conjunction of Saturn and the Moon, which denotes that the Moon, which denotes that the Moon and Saturn come in Conjunction on the 9th.  Now, since the Moon is in the sign of Virgo on the 9th of January, Saturn must also be in the same sign on that day.  On the 15th of January the 6th column has Conjunction of the Moon with Venus, and since the Moon is in the sign Sagittarius on this day, Venus must also be in the same sign at the same time.  Thus, by means of the Conjunctions of the Moon and of the planets, we can easily find out in which signs such Planets are at the times of the Conjunctions.</p><p>The Rising and setting of the principal Planets and of some of the fixed Stars are also given in the 6th column.  The fixed Stars which can always be seen on clear nights, are all Suns, shining by their own light, and being at immense distances from the Earth.  Apparently they rise and set at about the same time from year to year, moving from East to West with the entire vault of the heavens; but since the Earth, in her yearly path around the Sun, moves from West to East, these Stars rise and set about 4 minutes earlier every day.  This is the reason why the entire Heavens, with all the Stars (Suns) move around the  Earth once oftener in a year than the Sun.  While the Sun moves 365 times around the Earth the Heavens move around her 366 times.  All these facts, and many others, which space does not permit to give, prove conclusively the correctness of the Copernian System: that the Earth revolves on her axis once every year; that the Earth moves around the Sun once a year; that the Earth revolves on her axis once every 24 hours; that Venus and Mercury are Planets having their orbits between the Sun and the orbit of the Earth, and that all the other Planets have the path around the Sun outside that of the Earth.</p><p>The 7th column marked <hi rend="italics">Sun Slow</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Sun Fast</hi> contains for each day the number of minutes a well regulated clock deviates from the Sun.  For instance, 4 in this column under Sun Slow indicates that when it is 12 O'clock noon, by a correct clock, the Sun has not yet reached the meridian or noon line by 4 minutes; and 4 under <hi rend="italics">Sun Fast</hi> shows that when it is 12 o'clock noon, by the clock, the Sun has already passed the noon-line by 4 minutes.  This is so for the reason that the Earth, in moving around the Sun, is not always the same distance from the Sun; that she moves faster as she nears the Sun, as in the case when the Sun <hi rend="italics">is slow</hi>, and slower as she recedes from the Sun, as when the Sun is fast.  If the orbit of the Earth were a perfect circle, with the Sun at the centre, a correct clock would not deviate from the Sun.  The 8th and 9th <pageinfo><controlpgno>0018</controlpgno><printpgno>18</printpgno></pageinfo>columns show the rising and setting of the Sun for the 40th degree North Latitude.  The lengths of the days and nights vary for every degree North or South Latitude.  But the days and nights are always of equal length at the Equator.  From the beginning of Fall to the beginning of Spring, in the Northern Hemisphere, the days become shorter and the nights longer, and on the Southern Hemisphere the opposite is true. When the days are shortest and nights longest there we have here the longest days and shortest nights.  At the poles the days and nights are six months in length, and when it is day at the North Pole it is night at the South.  The 10th or last column contains the date of the Old Style.</p><p>It is to be hoped that this explanation is so plain that all may understand what the 10 columns of the Almanac contain.</p><p>W.R.

E. Church, and the other Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia--ex-Senator H. R. Revels and ex-Senator B. K. Bruce.  One served a short term of four years and was succeeded by the latter who served the full term of six years.</p><p>The representatives have all hailed from eight of the 42 States, viz: Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia.  Of the nineteen South Carolina has furnished seven, namely, Robert Brown Elliott, J.H. Rainey, Richard H. Cain, Robert C. De Large, A.J. Ransier, Robert Smalls and Thomas E. Miller; Alabama furnished three, Mr.--Turner, Jere Haralson and J.E. Rapier; North Carolina furnished three, John A. Hyman, James E.

A. Payne, D. D., and J.J. Moore, D. D., were mere boys.</p><p><hi rend="italics">Freedom's Journal</hi> was bitterly opposed from the start, as only a few colored people could read it, and the whites were prejudiced against it because it opposed the continuance of human slavery.  It was a medium sized weekly of neat appearance says the <hi rend="italics">"Afro-American Press</hi>,"  "while the composition was as good as some journals of to-day.  Mr. Russwurm had a most excellent estimate as to how an Afro-American journal should be conducted particularly at that time, and few men have lived who knew more about the business, or whose editorial pen could battle with such force against a volcano of sin and oppression, like unto that of American slavery.  It devolved upon him and his journal to create sentiment and to prove the interest which the free Afro-American of the North had in his oppressed brethren in the South.  Rev. Samuel E. Cornish associated Mr. Russwurm in the publication of the <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, and the decision to start it was reached at the house of M. Bostin Crummell, the father of Dr. Alexander Crummell.  Rev. Cornish was a very able and intellectual man, and was therefore a worthy coadjutor.  He was thoughtful and reliable, and thoroughly conversant with all the issues of that period.  He gained the distinction of being regarded as "undoubtedly the greatest wielder of the pen in a quarter of a century of Afro-American journalism."  <hi rend="italics">Freedom's Journal</hi> " ran one year and was succeeded by <hi rend="italics">"Rights of All</hi> " which continued an existence of about thee years. The two publications were very powerful, and their sentiment for the right and justice remained unchanged and unshaken till the end.  They fought for American freedom and American citizenship.</p><p>The <hi rend="italics">"Weekly Advocate</hi> " was the second newspaper venture by the race, being published by Philip A. Bell, proprietor, and Rev. Samuel E. Cornish, as editor.  Mr. Bell was regarded by Dr. Wm. Wells Brown as the "Napoleon of the Afro-American Press."  Then followed <hi rend="italics">"The Colored American</hi>,"  <hi rend="italics">The Elevator</hi>," <hi rend="italics">"The Ram's Horn</hi>," with such men as Chas. B. Ray, J.

In 1890 <pageinfo><controlpgno>0022</controlpgno><printpgno>22</printpgno></pageinfo>the number had increased to 154, or a gain of 123 in ten years.  If the growth during the next ten years continues at the same proportion, there exists no good reason why the race should complain of an insufficient number of white-winged messengers to make a winning fight for the blessings of liberty to which we are all entitled.</p></div><div><head>Negroes in the United States.</head><p>The Census figures showing the distribution of the colored population of the United States gives the total at 7,638,360.  This includes, however, Indians not in tribal relations, Chinese and Japanese as well as Negroes.  It will be safe enough, probably, to take 7,400,000 as representing the Negro population.  Upon this basis the net increase in ten years has been about 820,000, or a little over eleven per cent., which is very low, the rate of increase in the aggregate population being 34.86.</p><p>In the sixteen old slave States, including West Virginia with the District of Columbia and Oklahoma, there are about 6,890 000 Negroes, leaving only 510,000 for the remaining twenty-eight States of the Union. It is very remarkable that the migration of the Negroes should show such small results.  In 1880 there were, in round numbers, 438,000 Negroes outside of the old slave territory.  According to the present Census the changes of ten years have only added 72,000 to these figures.<lb>The great Negro States are:<lb><hsep>Colored.<hsep>White.<lb>Georgia<hsep>858,000<hsep>978,357<lb> Mississippi<hsep>742,000<hsep>544,851<lb> South Carolina<hsep>688,500<hsep>462,008<lb> Alabama<hsep>679,000<hsep>833,718 <lb>Virginia<hsep>635,000<hsep>1,020,122<lb> North Carolina<hsep>561,000<hsep>1,055,382<lb> Louisiana<hsep>559,000<hsep>558,395<lb> Texas<hsep>488,000<hsep>1,745,935 <lb>Tennessee<hsep>430,000<hsep>1,336,637<lb> Arkansas<hsep>309,000<hsep>818,752<lb> Kentucky<hsep>268,000<hsep>1,590,462<lb> Maryland<hsep>215,000<hsep>826,493</p><p>The great facts established by the Census are these:<lb>1.  The Negro population is practically confined to the old slave territory, and shows little inclination toward a general distribution. The race problem must be dealt with on the basis of this fact.</p><p>2.  The rate of increase of the Negro is below that of the whites, even in the most favorable conditions.  It is considerably less than half the percentage of increase maintained by the whole population.  This low rate of increase is not explained by immigration from abroad.  In South Carolina and Mississippi there are fewer foreign-born whites than in 1880; and in Alabama and Georgia the increase in this element does not aggregate 13,000.  Only in Texas it is considerable; there it reaches about 37,000.</p><p>3.

Perhaps the youth  of our own time hardly need the hint which it conveys to them.</p><p>No fallacy is more firmly fixed in the public mind than that which represents the establishment of our government as the work of old men.  The delusion is imbibed in childhood, and is unconsciously cultivated by the text-books used in schools.  The "fathers of the Republic" are depicted in all the histories with wigs, cues and other accessories of dress that apparently betoken age, and the pupil naturally concludes that they must have been old when the nation was born.  In point of fact, they were an uncommonly young set of men.  George Washington, senior in age, as we as in authority and influence, was but forty-three when the Revolution broke out, and fifty-seven when he became first President Thomas Jefferson, only thirty-three when he wrote the Declaration of Independence <pageinfo><controlpgno>0031</controlpgno><printpgno>31</printpgno></pageinfo>Alexander Hamilton, but thirty-two when he became Secretary of the Treasury; Jas. Madison, only twenty-three when he was made member of a Virginia Committee of Safety, and thirty-six when he was Hamilton's great collaborator in the production of that political classic, "The Federalist." Nor were the leaders in the great enterprise exceptional in this matter of age.  Forty names were signed to the Constitution of the United States on the 17th of September, 1787.  Leaving out of account four whose birthdays are not given by the books of reference, only five of the remaining thirty six had reached the age of sixty; twenty of the number were less than forty-five years old; and twelve were under forty, among the latter being one (Hamilton) of thirty, another of twenty-nine, a third of twenty-eight, and a fourth who lacked some months of twenty-seven when the convention met.  The average age of all the members did not quite reach forty-five years.  The most important committee to which the instrument was referred for final revision  consisted of five members, four of whom were between thirty and thirty-six years of age, the fifth and least prominent being sixty.</p></div><div><head>Smoking.</head><p>A great many men and boys, and even some girls and women, are fond of smoking.  The expense of smoking is quite an interesting item.  It is calculated that smoking three five cent cigars a day, will amount, in principal and interest in ten years to $745.74.  In twenty-five years it will amount to $3,110.74.  In ten years a man will blow away in smoke and ashes $1,471.56  if he smoke three ten-cent cigars per day; in twenty-five years he will have consumed $6,382.17.  At the end of fifty years he will have spent $54,162.14.  Does this pay?  This does not include the questions of courtesy and generous consideration for those to whom this habit is offensive and sickening, and these other items of so much importance because they affect personal influence and ability to support religious and benevolent objects.</p></div><div><head>Wars of the United States.</head><p>The Revolution, April 19, 1775 to April 11, 1783; Northwestern Indian wars, September 19, 1790, to August 3, 1795; war with France, July 9, 1798 to September 30, 1800; war with Tripoli, June 10, 1801 to June 4, 1805; Creek Indian war, July 27, 1813 to August 9, 1814; war of 1812 to February 17, 1815; Seminole Indian war, November 20, 1817 to October 21, 1818; Black Hawk Indian war, April 21, 1831 to September 31, 1832; Creek Indian war, May 5, 1836 to September 30, 1837; Florida Indian war, December 23, 1835 to August 14, 1843; war with Mexico, April 24, 1846 to July 4, 1848; Apache, Navajo and Utah war, 1849 to 1855; Seminole Indian war 1856 to 1858; civil war, or the great rebellion, 1861 to 1865.</p></div><div><head>Where Our Money Goes.</head><p>In the United States we spend annually for liquor, $900,000,000; bread, $505,000,000; for meat, $303,000,000; for iron and steel, $290,000,000; for woolen goods, $237,000,000; for sawed lumber, $233,000,000; for cotton goods, $210,000,000; for boots and shoes, $196,000,000; for sugar and molasses, $155,000,000; for public education, $92,000,000; for Christian Missions, $5,5000,000.</p></div><div><head>What a Horse can Draw.</head><p>On metal rails a horse can draw:--One and two-thirds times as much as on asphalt pavement;</p><p>Three and one-third times as much as on good Belgian blocks;</p><p>Five times as much as on ordinary Belgian blocks;</p><p>Seven times as much as on good cobble-stone;</p><p>Thirteen times as much as on ordinary cobble-stone;</p><p>Twenty times as much as <hi rend="italics">on an earth road</hi>;</p><p>And forty times as much as on sand.</p><p>A modern compilation of engineering maxims states that a horse can drag, as compared with what he can carry on his back, in the following proportion:--On the worst earthen road, three times more; on a good macadamized road, nine; on plank, twenty-five; on a stone trackway, thirty-three; and on a good railway, fifty-four times as much. </p></div><pageinfo><controlpgno>0032</controlpgno><printpgno>32</printpgno></pageinfo><div><head>SMILES.</head><p>--Deserved a Smile.

His road from the station was a lonely one, and he was getting along as fast as he could, when he suddenly suspected that a man behind him was following him purposely.  The faster he went the faster the man went, until they came to a churchyard.  "Now," he said to himself, "I'll find out if he is after me," and he entered the churchyard.  The man followed him.  Vague visions of revolvers and garroters grew upon him.  He made a detour of a splendid mausoleum.  Still the man was after him, round and round.  At last he turned and faced the fellow, and asked: "What the dickens do you want?  What are you following me for?"  "Well, sir, do you always go home like this?  I am going up to Mr. Fitzkrown's house with a parcel, and the porter at the station told me that if I'd follow you I should find the place, as you live next door.  Are you going home at all to-night?" -- <hi rend="italics"> Melbourne City and Country.</hi></p></div></body></text></tei2>
