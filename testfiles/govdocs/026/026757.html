      <p><span class="helv10bld">I. Welcome</span><span class="helv10"> - Cliff 
        Lee covered the procedures for evacuation in the event of an emergency 
        evacuation and/or &quot;Shelter-in-Place&quot; crisis. He also reminded 
        participants to sign the attendance sheet. For those who might not have 
        noticed it, Cliff pointed out that a CAPPS Survey box was located just 
        outside the door for representatives who wish to drop off their completed 
        CAPPS surveys anonymously. He indicated that representatives who did not 
        receive a copy of the e-mail could contact one of the PPSPS staff and 
        we would see that s/he gets a copy.</span> </p>
      <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">II. IDMS Release 16.0</span> - 
        Penny Forbes introduced Kurt Guerion to talk about the implementation 
        schedule for the next release of IDMS (v 16.0). Kurt indicated that the 
        testing was originally scheduled for the weekend of June 11 with implementation 
        scheduled for the weekend of June 25. June 11 is a non-payroll implementation 
        weekend. However, June 25 is a payroll implementation weekend so the June 
        25 date is up in the air right now. He said that NFC is considering trying 
        to do both testing and implementation during the weekend of June 11. However, 
        the staff is still gathering information on whether it is feasible to 
        do this and should know if it is a go by early next week. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">A. <b>Q</b>:</span> Penny what 
          does this mean? <span class="helv10bld">A:</span> Penny - We need clients 
          to come in on June 11th to test with live data for that Saturday. Clients 
          wishing to participate need to call OCC in advance. Kurt added that 
          NFC was going to send something out in writing requesting testers as 
          soon as information regarding the June 25th date was settled. Kurt explained 
          that the current release would come down, v 16.0 would be installed 
          for testing on the weekend of June 11th for production on June 13th. 
          In the event that there are critical issues that cannot be resolved 
          the old release would be re-instated on Sunday, June 12th. Issues would 
          be worked out, IDMS 16.0 would be re-tested on June 25th and, if successfully 
          tested, left in permanently. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>B.</b> <b>Q</b>: What is IDMS?<b> A:</b> Kurt - This 
          is the system software where the data resides. Not the application software, 
          but the system (i.e., not Microsoft Word, but Windows XP). The systems 
          themselves should not be affected. On June 11th, NFC needs to make sure 
          the software works properly on the new system before leaving the new 
          version loaded. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>C.</b> R: Clarification, if IDMS 16.0 goes into production 
          on June 11 and there are no problems that remain unresolved after testing, 
          it will stay up.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>D.</b> <b>Q:</b> DHS - are there any application 
          changes due to this upgrade?<b> A:</b> Randy - Not that we are aware 
          of at this time. We are doing our own testing right now. However, we 
          need client participation to do a more thorough test process.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>E.</b> <b>Q:</b> DHS - Will you be providing test 
          scripts?<b> A:</b> NO. The agencies need to bring in their production 
          data. NFC will have OCC and other staff's manned in case there are issues 
          with the new version of IDMS. We need as many agency staff at their 
          normal work sights processing regular work. <b>THIS IS LIVE DATA PROCESSING 
          AND NOT TEST PROCESSING. CHANGES ENTERED WILL BE LIVE!</b></p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>F. Q</b>: SI - How will this affect FESI?<b> A:</b> 
          This should have no effect on the FESI process. We still suggest that 
          you test to be on the safe side. There is always a risk of the unexpected. 
          <b>FQ:</b> How will we find out if we have a problem? FA: We will schedule 
          a pass of PINE that weekend to test this scenario to make sure it works 
          (processing of PP-11 data.) This would also be a good time for those 
          with FESI to do additional testing if you have something going on in 
          your own system. If you are doing this extra testing, please let us 
          know.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><b>G.</b> <b>Q</b>: TR - If you run a pass of PINE, 
          will that be on Saturday?<b> A:</b> Yes. We would have to review the 
          results on Saturday so we can use Sunday to pull back version 16 if 
          we needed to do this.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">III. PINE &amp; PAYE Schedule 
        for PP's 16 &amp; 17</span> - Penny Forbes indicated that NFC is scheduled 
        to convert the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the U.S, 
        Coast Guard (USCG) to NFC's system in PP-17. Because this is expected 
        to be a large and lengthy conversion, NFC is planning on accelerating 
        PP-16's 1st and 2nd PAYE schedules. The first pass for all CV's would 
        run on Thursday, August 25th and second on Friday, August 26th. NFC is 
        planing to switch to this schedule permanently on October 1st anyway. 
        Because of the conversion process, the first two passes of PINE for PP-17 
        would then run on Saturday, August 27th and Sunday August 28th for all 
        CV's.</p>
      <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">IV. Distribution of Reports</span> 
        - Penny Forbes discussed the concerns NFC has about producing reports 
        that have to go to the agencies. NFC realizes that most agencies have 
        restrictions against providing full SSN's via e-mail. She indicated that 
        NFC would like to provide the name with the last four digits of the SSN. 
        (i.e., they would mask the first 5 digits of the SSN on the report.).</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">A.</span> <b>Q</b>: SI - Would 
          you include name?<b> A:</b> Yes, the names would be on the reports. 
          NFC is putting it on there right now anyway. <b>FC:</b> No, not on our 
          last one. FA: It should have been. NFC is concerned with faxing and/or 
          e-mailing employee lists that contain the full SSN. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">B.</span> <b>Q</b>: DHS - Is 
          there a way to put them in a data set that we could go download in lieu 
          of manual distribution?. Something like a FOCUS report? Are there other 
          options?<b> A:</b> Penny - In order to do that you would need to have 
          access to whatever file name we were putting them into. <b>FC:</b> DHS 
          we could set up a standard. <b>FR:</b> Penny - This may be a longer-term 
          solution. Jody - Does everybody agree with the recommendation to make 
          the data accessible and the agency rep would be responsible for downloading 
          the information. Penny indicated that NFC would have to have separate 
          data sets for each group and this would have to be a project that NFC 
          set-up. <b>FC:</b> USDA - Why not put it out on the Reporting Center 
          (RC)? Penny that is an option. <b>FC:</b> DHS - The problem with the 
          RC is that we cannot see all of our topics now. USDA- If you use the 
          scroll bar on the left-hand side you should be able to see everything.. 
        </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">C.</span> <b>Q</b>: SI - Can 
          you put data into an excel spreadsheet out to the clients.<b> A:</b> 
          Penny - We don't want to make this process so laborious that we have 
          to start charging for it. <b>FC:</b> What about reports with a password?</p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">D.</span> <b>Q</b>: FMCS - We 
          purchased certificates and have never had any place to use them.<b> 
          A:</b> Theresa - I'm not sure when we started dealing with FMCS on certificates. 
          Normally when we work with a client to obtain certificates they are 
          for specific agency uses. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">E.</span> <b>Q</b>: What level 
          of certificate do you need?<b> A:</b> It is not the level. <b>FC:</b> 
          Cheryl all USDA employees are at a level 2. <b>R:</b> Level 2 is not 
          a digital certificate. You need a higher level. There is a difference 
          in the transaction. There is going to be more information on this subject 
          at the customer forum in July. <b>FQ:</b> Penny there is a cost to do 
          this? <b>FC:</b> FMCS - NFC recruited FMCS to do this. <b>FA:</b> Penny 
          indicated that someone would contact her off-line on the FMCS issue.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">V. Special Salary Rate (SSR) Changes</span> 
        - Cliff indicated that OPM did away with 103 SSR tables and modified 217 
        others. The ones remaining in effect are on OPM's website. Most have effective 
        dates of May 1, 2005, although a few have earlier effective dates that 
        may go back as far as January 1, 2005. The terminated tables cannot be 
        found on OPM's website because they do not keep a history. The NFC bulletin 
        was released late yesterday and there is quite a bit of information on 
        the SSR changes in the bulletin.</p>
      <p class="helv10">The Work Force Flexibility Act (WFFA) changed the definition 
        of basic pay to include locality adjustments. This allowed OPM to change 
        the regulations on how they handled special rates. In situations where 
        the locality pay for a geographic area exceeded a SSR in that same area, 
        the SSR grades and/or steps superceded by locality were terminated. The 
        only exception is the SSR 0491 (LEO Table) which has remained unchanged.</p>
      <p class="helv10">Cliff also reminded clients that NFC did send an e-mail 
        to clients asking for a &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; on whether 
        the agency wanted NFC to process the conversion from SSR to the standard 
        pay rate for you. That deadline is COB tomorrow, May 19th. The category 
        of employees affected by these changes are those with a pay rate determinant 
        (PRD) of 5, 6, E, or F. Only employees with a PRD of 5 or 6 appeared on 
        the report distributed to the agencies. The actual program sweep that 
        NFC would perform would be based on: 1) the employee has a PRD of 5, or 
        6; and 2) the employee's locality adjustment is greater than 0. In these 
        cases the SSR has been superceded by locality, thus the employee is no 
        longer entitled to the SSR. For those with employees with a PRD code of 
        E and F, a separate list of affected employees was generated. Those agencies 
        received special guidance from Cliff on how to process the removal from 
        the SSR coverage. These cases were different because they involved SSR 
        and grade retention. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">A. Q: </span>DHS - Did we have 
          any of these?<b> A:</b> Cliff - there were no DHS employees on the list. 
          Only DOJ, AG, AFRH, TR, and DOC had employees impacted. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">B. Q:</span> If we have an employee 
          in SINQ due to a WGI to be processed this pay period, what do we do?<b> 
          A:</b> Cliff - if you have individuals in this situation, you have two 
          options. 1) Wait for NFC to do the sweep for you and then change the 
          PRD from a 6 to a 0. Make sure that the salary is correct. The authentication 
          date should also be subsequent to the one used on the system generated 
          894 ZLM. <b>OR</b> 2) Do the 894 ZLM yourself and modify the PMSO record.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">C. Q:</span> SI - What happened 
          to the SSR tables 0414 and 0422 for engineers?<b> A:</b> Cliff - what 
          happened is a modification was made to nationwide and worldwide rate 
          tables to include a statement that says &quot;Be advised certain localities 
          have rates that are higher than those on this table and the SSR should 
          be terminated in those areas.&quot; If your locality exceeds your SSR, 
          you are no longer entitled to the SSR. These individuals are on the 
          report and the agency must have an action processed to take the employee 
          off the SSR. In most of the RUS locality areas, the SSRs still apply. 
          This situation came up on several tables including the IT rates.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">D. Q:</span> TR-BPD - If we 
          go ahead and do the 894 ourselves in order for the 893 to apply, does 
          this cause a problem with the NFC sweep?<b> A:</b> Cliff - No. If the 
          agency processes the conversion from the SSR, the sweep criteria would 
          no longer apply to that employee.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">E. Q:</span> SBA - The 893's 
          were effective on April 30th.<b> A:</b> Cliff - No they are effective 
          on 05/01/05. <b>FQ:</b> The agency has to do something with actions 
          in suspense even if we wait until after NFC sweeps right?<b> A:</b> 
          Cliff - Yes. You need to change the PRD and salary on the document and 
          possibly modify the PMSO, if the position is different from the one 
          swept.</p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">F. Q:</span> We've identified 
          four people who separated on May 1st and two who changed jobs on or 
          after May 1st. What about them?<b> A:</b> Cliff - We're excluding the 
          separated employees and if the employee is no longer in the SSR position 
          we will not capture them. Keep in mind the PRD factors into the sweep. 
          <b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> if you moved them out of SSR coverage on a promotion, 
          you may have an HR issue from the 2-step rule. This is because OPM has

        - Penny Forbes discussed the 2005 Customer Forum scheduled for July 26 
        and 27th. On the 26th, the OCIOS and OCFO's are invited to attend the 
        am session. The general discussions, which in past years were held in 
        the morning, will be held in the afternoon session. The sessions on the 
        26th will be held at the USDA South Building in the Jefferson auditorium. 
        The demos on the 27th will be in the Customer Support Office. Information 
        will on the web page later this week. The only thing scheduled for 27th 
        is demos. However, these sessions will be more than just the standard 
        demos of the past. Included in each demo session will be information regarding 
        picture issues as they relate to the system being demonstrated. This will 
        include such items as time-line for role-outs, enhancements, etc. The 
        first day of the 2005 forum will be tied to the President's agenda and 
        more of an annual report. We will not have the standard system update 
        information that we have included in the past. All of the system information 
        will be shared during the demos on the 27th. The agenda will be out in 
        the next couple of weeks.</p>

        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">A.</span> <span class="helv10bld">CFC 
          functionality</span> - This initiative has not expanded from an EEX 
          standpoint. While they are still offering the pilot sites, EEX staff 
          has been working closely with DC area CFC effort. This campaign area 
          has done a lot of automation and EEX is working with them to see if 
          the campaigns site can be used for employees to input data. This would 
          be a prototype for how OPM would like the CFC drives operating throughout 
          the US. For the first time OPM is going to try and manage the functionality 
          through out the USA better. The idea is to cut down the 300-400 campaign 
          areas and consolidate them. That may be something the E-payroll providers 
          will want to deal with OPM directly on to benefit the employees' significantly. 
          This initiative would be open beyond EEX (i.e., to ESS users and others).

          The discussions spun off a bit into areas that did not impact EEX and 
          were bought back into alignment to focus on what the agencies need for 
          their employees. We will see how successful the realignment is in the 
          next few months. The prior focus would have supported EHRI initiatives,

      <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">IX. Three R's</span> - Cliff Lee 
        - OPM had a forum on the 3 R's - recruitment, relocation, and retention 
        bonuses. For starters they changed the terminology to &quot;incentives.&quot; 
        The new regulations on the 3 R's were posted last Friday. Thanks to DHS 
        for shipping an advance copy to us. Did anyone go to the forum? DHS, yes. 
        Cliff indicated that he was surprised when OPM announced that they had 
        issued processing instructions to the payroll offices. As it turns out 
        NFC did not receive them until after the meeting because they were sent 
        immediately before it. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">A.</span> OPM is proposing a 
          new NOA and authority code for the retention allowance. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">B.</span> In short, the new 
          3 R regulations change the computation of the incentives from basic 
          pay (exclusive of locality pay) to adjusted salary (including locality 
          pay). </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">C.</span> There is also a requirement 
          for service agreements with the exception of retention incentives paid

        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">D.</span> In addition, in the 
          past the recruitment and relocation bonuses were paid out as lump sum 
          payments only. Now agencies have greater flexibility - lump sum, installments, 
          sideways, anyway you want to pay them out. Any combination of these 
          will cause a problem with NFC initially because we will have to pay 
          via Manual Pay because </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">1.</span> we compute on basic

          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">2.</span> we cannot accommodate 
            installment payments via the system.</p>
          <p class="helv10">Until the system is updated our only option is Manual

        </blockquote>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">E. </span>Another sticking point 
          is there is a 'grandfather clause' in the regulations so that anyone 
          currently receiving a retention allowance may continue to receive it 
          under the old regulations until April 30, 2006. Anyone who has received 
          a commitment for a recruitment or relocation bonus under the old regulations 
          prior to May 1, 2005, may still receive that lump sum payment in accordance 
          with the terms of their service agreement. </p>
        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">F. </span>The new 3 R regulations

        <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">G.</span><span class="helv12bld"> 
          </span>There are numerous changes for the 3 R's. Agencies are required 
          to set up Recruitment, Relocation, and Retention Incentive Plans. The 
          new regulations also impose a reporting requirement to Congress for 
          the next five years. Some data elements required for reporting are not 
          in CPDF. Agencies will need to maintain some of the reporting data. 
          NFC will need time to review the numerous changes and their impact on 
          the payroll/personnel systems. For the foreseeable future, we will only 
          be able to process recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives 
          under the new regulations via Manual Pay. </p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">1. Q:</span> SI - Effective 
            when? <span class="helv10bld">A:</span> May 13, 2005. Jo added that 
            this is one of those weird situations where if the agreement in place 
            and person is not coming in until May 30th or June 1st they are grand 
            fathered to retain a negative benefit (i.e., the computations are 
            worth more under the new regulations!) Cliff indicated that OPM is 
            allowing agencies to dust off the current regulations and add a statement 
            that you are adopting the new regulations and slap a cover letter 
            on it and proceed. OPM is being flexible on this issue.</p>
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">2. Q:</span> George - Do we 
            need to coordinate with other payroll providers? <span class="helv10bld">A:

            them monthly but we have not had any detailed discussion on this subject. 
            This will present challenges to all of us. </p>
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">3. Q: </span>DHS - One of 
            the new requirements will be reporting for five years. Since all the 
            data is in the NFC payroll, are you going to produce the reports?<b> 
            A:</b> We will provide the data that we have in our system. However, 
            it appears to me that some of the reporting requirements levied by 
            OPM will require a written report. There are non-statistical items 
            that fall back on the agency to address. Whatever we can provide statistically, 
            we will but your agency input will have to be handled individually. 
            There are questions like &quot;WHY did you give it to them?&quot; 
            Jo added that reps will need to keep in mind we will be going via 
            Manual Pay for a period, so initially we won't have any data. </p>
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">4. Q:</span> At this time

          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">5. Q:</span> Will NFC block 
            the system or add an edit in the system so we cannot process those 
            NOAs? <span class="helv10bld">A:</span> Cliff - We cannot do that 
            because some of the agencies are processing &quot;grand fathered&quot; 
            cases under the old rules. <span class="helv10bld">FQ:</span> Can 
            still use the base salary? <span class="helv10bld">A: </span>Yes under 
            the old regulations we use the old salary - lose out on the benefit. 
            Cliff - There is nothing to prevent a renegotiation of the incentive 
            to allow them to take advantage of the new reg. With a new agreement 
            the incentive would be based on locality pay. </p>
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">6. Q:</span> TR - what about 
            NOAC? <span class="helv10bld">A: </span>Right now it will be the same 
            NOAC for recruitment and relocation with some new authorities for 
            some provisions. One thing they have is a waiver to give them the 
            25% and pay out at 50% for twice as fast processing. <b>FQ:</b> Since 
            we are paying these via manual pay there is no NOAC in the system, 
            right?<b> A:</b> That's right. Until the programming is done you cannot 
            record them in the system. <b>FQ:</b> After system is programmed, 
            will we be able to go back and enter the NOAC? FA: Not sure. Keep 
            track of those done via the manual process. You will need the list 
            to go back and enter the NOAC in the system or report them to OPM. 
            Cliff - Once we have passed the grand fathered period, we will close 
            down the old programming. Take a close look at the regulations and 
            fact sheets because this is a huge change.</p>

            (DOC had expressed interest in this option earlier, but funding was 
            an issue. SS is paying for the programming.) Therefore, effect in

            and award code C099. For these awards, the payment will be grossed-up 
            and issued on the bi-weekly schedule. There is a $6500 input (net) 
            limit on these awards, because the average gross-up amount is about 
            30%. With the $6,500 net cap, the award total should stay under the

            need to be advised that this is a ballpark figure. And it is the agencies 
            responsibility to ensure that the gross award amount does not exceed 
            the $10,000 OPM restriction. The actual amount the award is grossed-up 
            to will vary based upon the employee's situation. For example, if

            Times&quot; and I had indicated that the T&amp;A Requirements Workgroup 
            had already submitted a request to utilize the new fields. For those 
            who are not aware of it, when the database was changed back in 2002 
            there were two additional &quot;Other Times&quot; created. OtherTime3 
            and OtherTime4 and their associated fields. NFC plans to have the 
            programming in place to begin utilizing those fields in PP-10. For 
            those not using STARWEB you can use these fields by doing a continued 
            T&amp;A. The x-mit file layout does not change. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">a. Q:</span> How do we do 
              this? <span class="helv10bld">A:</span> In most cases, nothing on 
              the user community side will change. Do not lose a lot of sleep 
              over this one. For most of you you've had T&amp;A's rejecting because 
              you have been sending NFC more than two OtherTime records. Now that 
              the programming is in place for OtherTime3 and 4, these additional 
              'other time' records will stop causing the T&amp;A to reject. For 
              example, if the T&amp;A was transmitted with LWOP, AWOL, and credit 
              hours earned; one of these transaction codes disappeared (either 
              dropped completely as with credit hours earned or two non-pay times 
              may have been combined to one value. Again, if you are a STAR 4.25 
              user you will not notice any change. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">2. Effective in PP-10,</span> 
            <span class="helv10bld">credit hours earned, compensatory time earned 
            and compensatory time for travel earned</span> can be submitted with 
            or without accounting depending upon how you have it defined in your 
            T&amp;A system. Typically timekeepers think of TC's that require accounting 
            as regular TC's and TC's that do not as other TC's. Another way of 
            looking at if for those old PC-TARE users is the &quot;above the line&quot; 
            vs the &quot;below the line&quot; option. TC's above the line required 
            accounting, those below did not. Anyway, there has been special programming 
            in place for some of our agencies who do cost accounting to enable 
            them to store accounting associated with these types of time. The 
            T&amp;A Work group elected to open it up and allow agencies to make 
            the call as to which way they want to proceed. This enables those 
            agencies that do need to charge time spent accruing credit or comp 
            back to the specific project on which they were working to do so. 
            This is just like they have done in the past for overtime. If you 
            are a STAR 4.25 user, you will be forced to use this option in PP-10 
            if you elect to enter accounting on the T&amp;A. If stored accounting 
            is used on a T&amp;A, there is no change. The T&amp;A Work group felt 
            that it would have a minimal impact on those who do not want to use 
            it because most would be using stored accounting, which is the typical 
            choice for non-cost accounting agencies. However, the benefit to those 
            agencies that do utilize cost accounting will be significant. Once 
            we come out with STAR 5.0 and the agency can maintain agency specific 
            tables for this, those agencies not wishing to use this option can 
            change it back. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">a. Q:</span> TR - If you 
              put an accounting code, it's regular time?<b> A:</b> Jo - No, if 
              a TC is regular time, you HAVE to put in the accounting code on 
              the line. </p>
            <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">b. Q:</span> Okay, so if 
              using stored accounting there is no difference. But if you are using 
              line-by-line accounting it must be coded on the T&amp;A. Where do 
              you do this? <span class="helv10bld">A: Jo </span>- There should 
              be an indicator in all the T&amp;A systems. At least there is an 
              indicator in all of the NFC developed T&amp;A systems. I'm not sure 
              about agency systems, but they should not have hard coded it. Anyway, 
              this indicator can be set by TC (i.e., regular time, over time, 
              comp time, etc). It is frequently referred to as a &quot;top-flag&quot;, 
              but may have an official name. Please check NFC's Payroll/Personnel 
              manual, Title I, Chapter 7, Section 1. NFC is working on a bulletin 
              for this. Theresa Trentacoste added that, &quot;Lynn is working 
              on this as we speak&quot;. She added that both of the T&amp;A related 
              changes will be included in one bulletin because they are so closely 
              related and the distribution list would be the same for both items. 
              When we do a T&amp;A bulletin, we have a large percentage mailed 
              to that user community so we prefer doing one mailing to reduce 
              costs for everyone vs two separate bulletins and mail-outs. We plan 
              to rush the review and distribute it a soon as possible.. </p>

          <p class="helv10"><span class="helv10bld">3. 22-day military offset 
            leave</span> payout will be automated in PP-12 to calculate the amount 
            actually due to the employee. This has been a manual process and the 
            automation has been a long time coming. However, as we speak, the 
            programmers are working on this, table changes are being done, testing 
            is being done, etc. Jo reminded clients that, as discussed with the 
            original requirements for this, the HR office has to get involved 
            to process a 903 MIL personnel action to document the employee's military 
            hourly rate for the period to be paid when using the 22-day military 
            off-set leave (TC-68). The HR office will be required to enter in 
            the salary share offset code of &quot;9&quot; and the calculated military 
            hourly rate each pay period. This must be re-computed each pay period 
            because a activated military personnel pay rates typically vary each 
            pay period. With the new changes going into place, if we see TC-68 
            on the T&amp;A and nothing on the mainframe in for an offset value, 
            we will reject the T&amp;A. Otherwise, we will take the Federal computed 
            rate from NFC, deduct the military rate entered on the 903 document 
            for that pay period, and pay the employee the difference. In the event 
            that the military rate is higher than civilian rate, we will not pay 
            the employee for those hours, but will simply record them as TC-68 
            hours used and toss the code out the window for computing pay for 
            that pay period. This information will all be covered in a bulletin 
            that Directives is working on right now.</p>

              This includes programming changes for LOC, GAO. Jo indicated that 
              the changes on the EPIC end will be minor, the ability to add the 
              auth code and salary share code for the 903 action, open a couple 
              of fields when the combo is used, and modify/add a couple of up-front 
              edits. Rick indicated that the Beltsville staff will need to make 
              equivalent changes in EmpowHR. For those with other HR systems, 
              there will be minor changes in your FESI (i.e., permit the new authority 
              on the 903, allow the value of a 9 for the coop salary share code 
              on the 903, etc.). Jo was informed that the EPIC Help portion of 
              the changes will not be done until next EPIC client release, in 
              PP-14. Randy will check on the client release date.</p>
