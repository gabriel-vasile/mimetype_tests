<p><b>History of Investigations</b></center>

<p>The 1963 National Historic Landmark Theme Study characterized Mississippian
cultures (then called "Temple Mound" cultures) as different from the <a href="woodland.htm">Woodland</a>
cultures on the basis of distinctive ceramic vessel forms, the use of ground
shell as a tempering agent in ceramics, rectangularly shaped structures,
and ceremonial earthwork complexes. The earthworks contained flat-topped
pyramidal mounds used primarily as the bases or platforms for wooden temple
structures. Archeological excavations at these complexes uncovered high-status
burials, sometimes containing ceremonial materials that appeared to exhibit
shared iconography from site to site. It was speculated that these artifacts
represented a "Southern Cult" or shared religious manifestations that linked
these sites throughout much of the eastern United States. One major problem
noted in this study was the uncertainty of the place of origin of the Mississippian
culture.
<p>Archeological investigations over the last thirty years have given us
a very different picture than that characterized in the 1963 study. First,
although certain ceramic forms and tempering agents and rectangularly shaped
structures are still considered indicators of Mississippian period sites,
there now appears to be nothing dramatically new in the way Mississippian
cultures lived as opposed to the previous Woodland cultures. Walthall (1990)
has divided Mississippian cultural chronology into Early Mississippian
(A.D. 900 - A.D. 1200), Middle Mississippian (A.D. 1200 - A.D. 1500), and
Late Mississippian (A.D. 1500 - A.D. 1700). Mississippian sites appeared
almost simultaneously throughout the Southeast ca. A.D. 900 and were mainly
located within river floodplain environments.

<p><b>Mississippian Culture</b></center>

<p>It is now generally believed that a form of chiefdom government operated
within the Mississippian period. These chiefdoms, operating out of temple
mound complexes, such as Moundville or Etowah, apparently controlled specific
territories usually associated with a defined floodplain environment. Chiefs
were responsible for the redistribution of food between outlying communities
and the major community. Whether these chiefs were able to control exchanges
of goods within their territory and with other chiefdoms, employ full-time
artisans and specialists, or function as both the religious and political
head, are questons requiring more research.
<p>In all probability, Mississippian chiefdoms controlled only small geographical
areas and were in constant states of change because their power rested
on fragile agricultural adaptations. Failure of crops due to weather or
other natural forces would have imperiled population stability in the chiefdom.
In the past, much was made of the idea of a "Southern Cult" or pan-Mississippian
religious phenomenon, based on the finding of similar iconography on artifacts
of shell, copper, and ceramic from high-status burials in large Southeastern
temple mound centers. It is now realized that postulating a religion on
the basis of similar types of burial artifacts may be an erroneous assumption.
More likely, similarity in exotic artifacts was due to a Mississippian
exchange network linking hundreds of large and small communities, which
functioned to promote the exchange of prestige goods for food. A similar
exchange system probably functioned in the Middle Woodland period and similarly
accounted for the exchange of exotic goods that were similar in appearance
from site to site.
<p>Another earlier aspect has to do with the origin of the Mississippian
culture. The 1963 study noted that in earlier studies radiocarbon dating
was inadequate for dating Mississippian-type sites before about A.D. 900,
and it was then proposed that the Mississippian culture origin was based
at the great site of Cahokia near East St. Louis, Illinois, or in western
Kentucky and Tennessee. Today, archeological investigations and radiocarbon
dating have identified "proto-Mississippian" sites within the Weeden Island
culture area of the Gulf Coast of Florida and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee
valleys of Alabama and Georgia, which date from the Middle to Late Woodland
period of ca. A.D. 150-750. Excavations have identified flat-topped or
platform ceremonial, rather than burial, mound complexes that are similar
in layout to early Mississippian period earthworks.
<p>Another important result of the work conducted on Mississippian sites
in the last thirty years has been the differentiation of the Mississippian
culture into distinctive cultural areas. The Middle Mississippian area,
represented by the major sites of Cahokia and Moundville, covers the central
Mississippi River Valley, the lower Ohio River Valley, and most of the
Mid-South area, including western and central Kentucky, western Tennessee,
and northern Alabama and Mississippi. This appears to be the core of the
classic Mississippian culture area, containing large ceremonial mound and
residential complexes, sometimes enclosed within earthen ditches and ramparts
or a stockade line.
<p>The lower Mississippi River Valley contains the Plaquemine Mississippian
culture area in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Plaquemine Mississippian
earthwork sites are similar in appearance to Middle Mississippian complexes,
except the former are ceremonial in nature and usually lack a residential
aspect. Good examples of this culture are the Emerald Mound and Holly Bluff
(Lake George) sites located in Mississippi.
        <p><a href="gorget1.jpg"><img SRC="gorget.gif" height=214 width=235 align=RIGHT border="0" alt="Click to enlarge "></a>The 
          South Appalachian Mississippian area appears to have derived its inspiration 
          from the Middle Mississippian culture area, as it appears to post-date 
          Mississippian occupation from the latter area. Settlement patterns of 
          floodplain occupation, with stockades enclosing earthen temple mounds 
          and residential areas, such as those represented at Etowah and Ocmulgee 
          National Monument in Georgia, and Shiloh National Military Park in Tennessee, 
          are characteristic of the South Appalachian Mississippian. Sites are 
          distributed throughout southeastern parks in Alabama, Georgia, northern 
          Florida, South Carolina, and central and western North Carolina and 
          Tennessee.

<p><b>Other Late Prehistoric Cultures</b></center>

<p>Coeval Mississippian areas include the Fort Ancient culture area of
southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky, and the Caddoan Mississippian of eastern
Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Arkansas, and western Louisiana. The Fort
Ancient culture emerged about A.D. 1400 as a response by local Late Woodland
populations to an increasing reliance on agriculture, increasing sedentism,
and the accompanying rise in socio-political complexity associated with
the Middle Mississippian culture area. The Fort Ancient culture produced
ceramics distinct from Middle Mississippian wares, with a settlement pattern
of villages organized into a circular or elliptical configuration of structures
surrounding a central plaza.
<p>The Caddoan culture appears to have emerged from the local Middle Woodland
cultures in the western Louisiana area ca. A.D. 800. Mississippian culture
traits common to the Caddo people primarily along the Red River drainage,
such as the use of maize agriculture, burial mounds, and temple mound complexes,
appear to have been derived from the Plaquemine Mississippian culture area
more so than the Middle Mississippian core area. However, the Caddoan culture
is generally viewed as a separate culture area from the Mississippian culture
of the Southeast.
<p>Other coeval Mississippian culture areas are the St. Johns culture area
of northeastern Florida, the Glades and Calusa culture areas of southern
Florida, and the coastal cultures of North Carolina. Many of these cultures
constructed temple mounds and/or burial mounds and, to a certain extent,
utilized maize agriculture; however, to a larger extent they continued
a Woodland type of subsistence in Late Prehistoric times until European
contact.
