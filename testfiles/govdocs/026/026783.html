<P><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>EARLY INDIAN MIGRATIONS</B></FONT><HR NOSHADE></P>

<P>By some unknown date, probably several centuries before Columbus
reached America, peoples belonging to the Caddoan stock had spread over
and occupied much of the country from the Red River into South Dakota,
and from the Missouri nearly to Scotts Bluff.<SUP><A
HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>  This was probably at the expense of Algonquin
tribes along the fertile Missouri bottoms.  It is doubtful if there was
ever any considerable Indian population of the Great Plains prior to the
introduction of the horse, which greatly facilitated the hunting of
buffalo and extensive migrations in search of water, fuel, and
shelter.</P>

<P>After the Caddoan occupation of the trans-Missouri region, there
occurred an influx of Siouan peoples, also agricultural, from the north
and east.<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP> The Dakota division of the Siouan
stock, defeated in disastrous wars with the Algonquin Chippewa (who were
aided by newly-acquired firearms from the French), around the beginning
of the 18th century began to emigrate southwestward from Minnesota. 
This movement forced the Algonquin Cheyenne and Arapaho ahead of them
into the Black Hills and Cheyenne river country<SUP><A
HREF="#3">3</A></SUP> of South Dakota.  The migrations and displacements
continued until, by 1800, the Dakota Sioux were in possession of most of
South Dakota.</P>

<P>The westward migration of tribes had by this time become greatly
accelerated through the use of the horse.  The horse (strayed or stolen
from the early Spaniards) had reached the Pawnees by 1700, and the
Dakotas by 1740.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP> Goaded by enemies on the
east and attracted by the herds of buffalo swarming over the Great
Plains of the Platte country, the Tetons (most western branch of the
Dakota Sioux) drove the Cheyenne and Arapaho before them, and had
occupied all of western Nebraska to the North Platte by 1830. 
Therefore, when white men began to enter Nebraska in numbers, they found
the Kansas, Omaha, and Ponca Sioux in the Missouri Valley; the Caddoan
Pawnees restricted to south central Nebraska, along the middle Platte
and Loup rivers; and the Ogallala and Brule divisions of the Teton
Dakotas over all the remainder of the state.  The Arapaho and southern
Cheyenne normally held the southern Platte country.</P>

<P>The Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Dakotas were normally at peace with each
other, but constantly warred against the Pawnees on the east and the
Shoshone on the west.  The Kiowa and Comanche had presumably drifted out
of Wyoming southeastward across western Nebraska, in the early 18th
century, to establish themselves in western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
 This set-up in the first half of the 19th century made the forks of the
Platte and wild battleground between the Cheyenne-Arapaho-Tetons and the
Pawnees.  Until about 1835 the Pawnees dared to have villages on the
North Platte, but a decisive defeat in that year near Ash Hollow<SUP><A
HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> caused them to retire far down the river to the
Loup country.</P>

<P>When these northwestern Plains Indians were first visited by
Europeans in the 19th century, they possessed a nearly uniform culture. 
This culture was based on use of the horse and hunting of the bison, and
conditioned to an exceedingly nomadic life.  Agriculture was practically
unknown (except among the Pawnees and other tribes to the east); very
little pottery was made; and the bison provided everything from fuel and
food to shelter and raiment.  These nomadic hunting horsemen naturally
became great horse stealers and far-raiding warriors.  Such were the
inhabitants of the Scotts Bluff area when the white man arrived.  In
numbers they may have approached a total of 40,000-50,000 souls,
divided: Dakotas, 25,000; Pawnees, 10,000; Cheyenne, 3,500; and Arapaho,
3,000.  As yet, smallpox, cholera, and drunkenness had not taken a toll
of these highly susceptible aborigines.<SUP><A HREF="#6">6</SUP></A></P>

occupancy of the Great Plains," pp. 438-470, Vol. 14, 1915-1918, Kansas
Historical Collections.  Mr. Connelley has used Indian traditions, the
reports of early travelers, and the evidence of artifact distribution in
working up his material and two distributional maps.  W. D. Strong, op.
cit., in American Anthropologist, discusses some of the archaeological
evidence for his postulated spread of Caddoan stock.</P>

Linguistic Stocks, 1650, compiled by Dr. J. R. Swenton, in the Paullin:
Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States, 1932, shows a
further encroaching of the Siouans into the fertile trans-Missouri
lowlands of Kansas and Nebraska.</P>
