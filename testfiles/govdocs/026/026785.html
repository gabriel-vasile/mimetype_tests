              <img src="images/caddo_ville1.jpg" alt="Natichitoches-Caddo village diorama." width="250" height="216" align="left">When Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery was being constructed in 1931, some
        100 burials were discovered. Research at that time and subsequent study
        agrees the site was a part of the Natchitoches Indian village </font></FONT><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">described
        by the French officer, <a href="tonti.html">Henri de Tonti</a>, in the
        records of his journey here in 1690. </font></p>
      <p><FONT SIZE=5><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            Caddo or Caddoan language group known more as the &quot;Caddo Confederacy,&quot; was
            found by the French and Spanish explorers and missionaries to be
            the dominant people along the rivers of the Red River basin, occupying
            lands now part of Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. </font></FONT></p>

      <p><FONT SIZE=5><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/digsite2501.jpg" alt="Archaeology at work recovering cultural heritage on the hatchery grounds." width="250" height="216" align="right">By
            the time de Tonti came here he had been in the Mississippi Valley
            region for about 8 years. He writes of a temple, typically on a raised
            mound, but details of the site are not mentioned. He does record
            there were three villages or tribes and names the Natchitoches as
            one, Ouasita, and Capichi as the other two. In his record he refers
            to these three as &quot;nations,&quot; and having &quot;chiefs,&quot; identifying
            these as not names of the villages but the names of the peoples
            or &quot;tribes&quot; gathered here in that February of 1690.</font></FONT></p>
      <p><span class="style14">It is clear the Natchitoches peoples were of the
          Caddo and this site is thought to be the seat of the southeast limit
          of the Caddoan territory. Tonti states the Taensas Indians, who were
          his guides from the Mississippi River, wished to trade for salt with
          the Natchitoches, who had access to the salt deposits in the area. </span></p>
      <p><span class="style14"><img src="images/shards2501.jpg" alt="Shards of Caddo pottery." width="250" height="216" align="left">The
          Spanish Captain Alonso de Leon (1689), who wrote of the Southern Caddo,
          the Hasinai, reported the people he encountered and their culture was, &quot;as
          civilized as the Aztecs had been when the Spaniards first came to Mexico.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="style14">The earliest European record of the Caddoan people comes
        from the DeSoto expedition (1542) when they encountered a powerful border
        land in southern Arkansas. Other early European accounts come from the
        La Salle expedition and members who survived the French Texas colony
        attempt in the late 1680's.</p>
      <p class="style14">The Caddo people and the culture dates far into the
        past according to archaeologists. Many questions still surround their
        origins, the cultural developments and society.</p>
      <p class="style14"> <img src="images/SealofCaddo1.jpg" alt="Seal of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma." width="250" height="288" align="right">A
        few things are pretty certain however. At the time of European contact
        from 1552 until 1690, the Caddo had established a remarkable and impressive
        culture, were in a comfortably powerful position and were known as &quot;<a href="http://www.fws.gov/scripts/exit.cfm?link=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas&amp;linkname=Texas Beyond History">The
        Kingdom of the Tejas</a>,&quot; according to the Spanish records. </p>
      <p class="style14">Many resources are available to learn more of the Caddoan
        culture and the impact on the region. Much has been lost, yet much has
        been and is being recovered. The work of archaeologists and the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/scripts/exit.cfm?link=http://www.caddonation-nsn.gov/&amp;linkname=Caddo Nation of Oklahoma">Caddo
