<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG><U></U>In November of 1997 and May of 1998, Olsson Environmental Sciences contracted
with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Department of Anthropology to conduct a
systematic archeological cultural resource survey as part of the ongoing South and East
Beltways Study in Lancaster County, Nebraska.  Investigations were conducted along a
single southern corridor (SM-4) and along three eastern corridors (EC-1, EM-1, EF-1).  As
part of this phase of the study, a pedestrian survey was conducted along a one-quarter mile
(0.4 km) wide corridor of the proposed SM-4, EC-1, EM-1 and EF-1 routes and one-half
mile (0.8 km) diameter areas surrounding ten intersection locations. In total, 47 archeological
sites were located, and several were tested for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility. Of these, three sites are recommended eligible to the NRHP.  The following report
is released for public distribution. Site locations, however, have been omitted per Nebraska
State statute LAW 84-712.</P>

<P>The South and East Beltways Study is a Major Investment Study/Environmental
Impact Statement being conducted to determine if major transportation improvements are
needed south and east of Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska. These improvements would
include construction of multiple lane roads within the study area boundaries (Olsson
Environmental Sciences 1997:1). At this time, the principal objective of the study, is the
preservation of a multi-use corridor within the southern and eastern fringes of Lincoln,
Nebraska (Figure 1) (EA Engineering 1995). The corridor areas, and general limits of the
project are as follows (Figure 2):</P>

<P><U>South corridor area</U>: Yankee Hill Road south to one-half mile south of Saltillo
Road, and U.S. Highway 77 on the west to Nebraska Highway 2 on the east.</P>

<P><U>East corridor area</U>: 96<SUP>th</SUP> Street eastward to one-half mile east of 148<SUP>th</SUP> Street,
and Interstate-80 on the north to Nebraska Highway 2 on the south.</P>

<P>The approximate length of the South and East Beltways Study Area is 17
miles (27.4 km), covering approximately 91 square miles (236 sq km).</P>

<P>This project will receive Federal
funding, and all reports and
documentation must meet the Nebraska
Department of Roads and Federal
Highway Administration requirements,
therefore, cultural resource inventories
are required for compliance with the
National Historic Preservation Act,
Section 106 review process (Olsson
Environmental Sciences 1997:1).</P>

<P>Figure 2. Project area of the South and East Beltways Study (map courtesy HWS
Consulting Group).</P>

<P>In November of 1997 and May of 1998, Olsson Environmental Sciences contracted
with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Department of Anthropology to conduct
a systematic archeological cultural resources survey along a single southern corridor (SM-4)
and along three eastern corridors (EC-1, EM-1, EF-1) as part of this ongoing South and East
Beltways (SEB) Study (Olsson Environmental Sciences 1997). Under separate contract, a
survey and National Register of Historic Places evaluation of standing structures was
implemented by "On Site Photography and Preservation."</P>

<P>The Standard Form of Agreement between Engineer (Olsson Environmental
Sciences) and Consultant (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) dated 7, November, 1997, called
for a survey of a single South Beltway route that "…<EM>corresponds to the SM-4 Route and the
three possible diagonal connections in the vicinity of Nebraska Highway 2</EM>" (Olsson
Environmental Sciences 1997:1). The dividing line between the South section and East
section of the Beltway Study Area is Nebraska Highway 2. At present, only one southern
route is being considered for development or cultural resource survey (Figure 3). A second
Standard Form of Agreement between Engineer (Olsson Environmental Sciences) and
Consultant (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) dated May, 1998, called for a survey of three
Eastern Beltway routes that "…<EM>correspond to the EC-1, EM-1 and EF-1 Routes</EM>" (Olsson
Environmental Sciences 1998:1). Three possible routes (EC-1; EM-1; EF-1) are still being
considered along the eastern edge of Lincoln, from Highway 2, northward to Interstate 80. </P>

<P>Both the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) and the UNL Department of
Anthropology have conducted surveys on individual tracts of land in the Study Area.
Additionally, during the summer of 1987, the UNL Department of Anthropology Summer
Field School conducted systematic inventory of limited portions of the Stevens Creek
drainage, which crosses the SEB Study Area east of Lincoln. Prior to this project, however,
no systematic, or large scale cultural resource inventory had been conducted in the SEB
Study Area.</P>

<P>Figure 3. Proposed South and East Beltway Alignments (Map courtesy HWS Consulting
Group).</P>

<P>As part of this phase of the project, systematic, intensive pedestrian archeological survey was
conducted along a one-quarter mile (0.4 km) wide corridor (1/8 mile (0.2 km) each side of
the centerline on the proposed SM-4, EC-1, EM-1 and EF-1 routes, including diagonals
(Figure 3) (Olsson Environmental Sciences 1997, 1998). In addition, survey was conducted
on one-half mile diameter areas surrounding ten potential intersections (Figure 3). The goal
of this cultural resource project was to identify surface archeological sites that exist within
the proposed corridors and to evaluate the potential for encountering unknown, or as yet
unrecognized, but significant cultural resources that could be negatively impacted by projects
related to this SEB Study, and subsequent development and/or construction.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">	</FONT>This report is a result of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Department of
Anthropology's pedestrian cultural resource survey, field evaluation and limited site testing
of the four SEB corridors and connecting intersections. The report presents relevant
background information, including a generalized regional environmental overview, and an
outline of the culture-history of Native populations of eastern Nebraska, with archival
information specific to Lancaster County. In addition, it presents site evaluations, potential
project impacts, and recommendations.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"></FONT></P>

<P><U>Site Records and Archives Search</U>:</P>

<P>	In 1996, a records search was conducted and a report was written, covering the South
and East Beltway Major Investment Study Area (Barton 1996). During that investigation,
a search of archeological records was conducted at the Nebraska State Historical Society
Archeological Site Records Office; the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office, and the
University of Nebraska Lincoln Department of Anthropology to determine the presence and
locations of previously recorded cultural resources within the defined SEB Study Area
(Table 1) (Barton 1996).</P>

<P>	Existing historic accounts record that, at the time of European arrival onto the Plains,
the region that became eastern Nebraska was dominated by Pawnee, Oto and Omaha Indians.
As reported by Barton (1996), however, previously recorded prehistoric sites within the
Study Area represent a much wider range of time and cultures. A total of thirteen previously
known prehistoric (Native American) sites were shown to be located within the SEB Study
Area.</P>

<P>Prior to this 1998 cultural inventory, only one of the prehistoric sites within the
project area was on the National Register of Historic Places. That site, 25LC1, the Schrader
Site, is a small late prehistoric village attributed to the Smoky Hill Phase (AD 950-1350) of
the Plains Village Period. Several earthlodges and associated features have been
archeologically investigated at 25LC1 (Hill and Cooper 1936). Two additional sites, 25LC18
and 25LC48, have been initially identified as Archaic Period sites, possibly dating as early
as 8,000 BP. Based on the surface manifestation, site 25LC35 is documented as Woodland
Period, dating to some time between 1,000 to 2,000 BP. Other identified prehistoric sites in
the SEB Study Area represent more recent Plains Village Period or Historic Native American
occupations.</P>

<P>	In addition to the prehistoric sites shown in the report (Barton 1996), fourteen
previously recorded historic sites, including some standing structures, were reported within
the SEB Study Area (forms on file NSHS). </P>

<P>Barton (1996) identified a "Cultural Resources Area," along Saltillo road, near the
western edge of the SEB Study Area. This Jamaica-Saltillo Historic District, 25LC85,
contains many individual historic properties and/or locations that are known to exist, but that
have not been individually or extensively documented. Maps (on file at NSHS) dated 1864
and later, indicate the presence of a soldier's camp, a settler's layover camp, a Mormon
camp, and three freighter's camps, as well as the early settlement communities of Saltillo and
Jamaica.</P>

<P>The Union Pacific Railroad established Jamaica as a railroad depot, watering and
loading station, undoubtedly hoping a town would grow from these roots. Several houses,
a Baptist church, a blacksmith's shop, a telegraph office, and possibly a feed and seed store
(Hayes and Cox 1889) were built at that location, but the town grew no further.</P>

<P>The town of Saltillo was founded by John Cadman who came to the area in 1859,
taking a claim along Salt Creek and establishing a stage station and the town of Saltillo on
that site. The Cadman Stage Station/Ranch is recorded as 25LC00-13 with the Nebraska
State Historic Society. Saltillo was ideally located for success, situated along Salt Creek at
a location that became the official ford for the Oregon Trail Nebraska City-Fort Kearny
Cutoff (25LC71). In 1860, the Cutoff was established to shorten the route between Nebraska
City and Fort Kearny. The new route made it unnecessary to go north before turning west
across Saunders County to follow the Platte River westward, this route shortened the Oregon
trail between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny by nearly 75 miles (120 km). The Cutoff
immediately became the most heavily traveled segment along the Oregon Trail until around
1873. By that time, Lancaster County was so heavily settled that traffic was forced to follow
surveyed section lines, and alternate routes were chosen (Olson 1966).</P>

<P>A Public School at Saltillo educated children from both Saltillo and Jamaica, as well
as the surrounding countryside. Businesses included a grain elevator, a creamery, and
stockyards. A Post Office was established in 1865, continuing operation until 1906
(Lancaster 1990:XIII-4). Saltillo enjoyed years of relative prosperity, and played an
important part in the lives of early Salt Valley settlers.</P>

<P>Not reported by Barton's (1996) record search, is the Olatha-Roca Historic District,
the northern portion of which extends into the southern study area, and the Shirley Road
Ranch, 25LC56, located east of Lincoln. The Olatha-Roca Historic District includes 21
separate historic entities, some which are extant structures, others are archeological
resources, including both prehistoric and historic sites (Lancaster County 1990:XIV-2).
Historic sites include numerous houses and farmsteads, several pioneer grave locations,
stream crossing fords, a blacksmith shop, two water-powered grist mills, and the Olatha
townsite (25LC38) (Lancaster County 1990:XIV-2).</P>

<P>	The majority of these individual Olatha-Roca Historic District properties are outside
of the SEB Area, however, the exact location, and extent of each archeological site within
the Historic District is not known. Archival information indicates the presence of such
resources, but complete and systematic survey and field research has not yet been conducted.
The Olatha-Roca Historic Historic District has been approved for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places, although at this time, nomination has not yet occurred (Lancaster
County 1990:XIV-3).</P>

<P>	The "Shirley Road Ranch" was located along Stevens Creek east of present-day
Lincoln. Established by William Shirley in 1858 at the junction of several trails and a stream
ford, the trading post/rest-station served travelers passing through the region. In 1859, the
election that established Lancaster County "<EM>for elective and judicial purposes</EM>" (Lancaster
1916:1037) was held at the Shirley Station. The U.S. Postal Service established a station
there is 1863, appointing Shirley the first postmaster of Lancaster County. The postal station
was closed only two years later, in October of 1865.</P>

<P>	This region of eastern Nebraska that encompasses the SEB Study Area was settled
by Euroamericans quite soon after passage of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act that created the
Nebraska Territory and opened the region to authorized settlement. The first official settler
to take permanent residence in Lancaster County was John D. Prey who arrived in the Salt
Creek valley in spring of 1856 (Although at the time, his property was in the now defunct
Clay County, which was divided between Gage and Lancaster Counties in 1864). His
homestead was located along Salt Creek, just outside the SEB Study Area. It is recorded with
the NSHS as site 25LC39. Many settlers followed Mr. Prey, and the region along southern
Salt Creek, and east along Steven's Creek were settled and well populated several years prior
to the development of Lincoln (Hayes and Cox 1889).</P>

<P>Vague and incomplete reports also exist in the archives that suggest a few
Euroamericans settled in the region preceding these official dates. These would include
settlers who illegally occupied the region prior to the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, as well as
individuals (squatters) who simply did not register a claim on the property that they
occupied. Several early Lancaster County maps, as well as settler's accounts suggest pre-1856 residents in, or near the SEB Study Area. Although the locations are imprecise, reports
suggest that a pre-1856 cabin existed north of present-day Lincoln, along and east of Salt
Creek, (map on file UNL Anthropology Department). Early documents also report at least
one pre-1856 dugout along Stevens Creek, although the number and locations are, as yet,
unknown (notations on file UNL Anthropology Department).</P>

<P>Four major historic trails, and several cutoffs related to those trails, are also known
to cross the SEB Study Area. The greatest portions of these linear sites have been destroyed
by years of tillage, land leveling, and natural erosion/sedimentation processes. In a few cases
though, short sections of these historic features have been preserved by far-sighted individual
landowners, or at unplowed margins between individual properties. Recent documentation
also records remnants of several rock fords that have survived the years, and are visible along
the banks of Salt Creek and Stevens Creek (Lancaster County 1990:VIII-1-3). </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>2. <U>Physiographic and Environmental Background</U></STRONG></P>

<P>	Humans are highly mobile creatures that move about within and between
environmental zones, to procure the resources they need and/or desire. For human groups to
occupy any location for an extended period of time, certain essential resources, such as food,
water, fuel, and raw material must be available through either direct procurement or trade,
within a cost effective distance. Most frequently, archeological sites are the result of human
activity which concentrates resources at a central location where those resources are altered,
consumed, discarded, lost, or abandoned when the group moves to another central location
where the process is repeated (Binford 1983:262; Thomas 1989:224). Consequently, to
adequately evaluate the cultural resources, especially the archeological potential of any
project area, researchers must examine more than just precise, localized points on a map. To
be responsible to the cultural resources, a researcher must gain a general understanding of
the regional environmental setting, the climate, and the availability of natural resources. In
addition, the natural geologic formation processes that create and preserve, or destroy, sites
should be taken into account.</P>

<P><U>Regional Geology</U>:<U></U></P>

<P>	The primary upper bedrocks underlying this portion of Nebraska are Wabaunsee
Formations of Pennsylvanian System limestone, deposited prior to 280 million years ago,
and Admire and Council Grove Formations of Permian System limestones and interbedded
shales laid down in a vast inland sea before 245 million years ago. Overlying the limestone
formations are Dakota Formation sandstones deposited during the Lower Cretaceous Period,
roughly 120 million years ago.</P>

<P>Throughout the Quaternary Period, between 1.6 million to 10,000 years ago, multiple
stages of deposition occurred across what is now eastern Nebraska. Approximately 1 million
years ago, Kansan Age ice sheets spread layers of glacial drift, composed of granite and
quartzite boulders, cobbles, and pebbles, across eastern Nebraska, covering the ancient
stream-eroded Pleistocene topography. These Kansan Age glacial tills were then overlain by
Illinoian Age sand, sandy-gravel, and coarse gravel deposits of glacial-meltwater outwash
alluvium laid down around 150,000 years ago. In turn, these were mantled by a series of
three major loess deposits (Soil Conservation Service 1980).</P>

<P>	The Loveland Formation is the oldest of these loess deposits and is typically a
yellowish-brown eolian silt that reddens toward the top of the unit due to pedogenesis.
Thermoluminescence dating of the Loveland paratype section from sites in western Iowa
indicate that Loveland Loess was deposited during the Kansan Age, about 140,000 years ago
(Forman et al. 1992; Mandel and Bettis 1992). More recent Wisconsinian Age deposits (&lt;
biblio &gt;) bury the reddish Sangamon soil developed in the upper portions of Loveland.</P>

<P>	The Gilman Canyon Formation is the oldest Wisconsinian loess deposit and is
composed of a dark brown, silt loam that has been modified by pedogenesis. Radiocarbon
ages of organics contained in the Gilman Canyon Formation range from around 35,000 years
at its base to 20,000 years of age at the top (Johnson and Zhaodong 1993; Mandel and Bettis
1995; May and Souders 1988).</P>

<P>	The most recent major eolian deposit, a mantel of Peorian Loess overlies the Gilman
Canyon Formation. The yellowish-tan to buff-brown colored silts of the Peorian Loess
Formation covers substantial portions of the region. In many areas cross-sections exhibit
primary eolian bedding indicating rapid deposition. Radiocarbon ages from Peoria Loess
deposits at several sites in Nebraska range from about 23,000 years at its base to 13,000
years near the top (Johnson et al. 1993; Mandel and Bettis 1995).</P>

<P>	Subsequent to the Pleistocene Loess depositions, the topography has been further
shaped by erosion and deposition within a very active fluvial system. Deposits of fine-grained to sandy-or-gravely Holocene alluvium blanket the drainages of both Salt Creek and
Stevens Creek. Localized deposits may also consist of coarser sediment in areas where till
and glacial alluvium is exposed on valley slopes. Ages of this alluvium range from more than
10,500 years, to as recent as sediment washed downslope by last summer's rains. The
thickness of the alluvium is extremely variable in eastern Nebraska, being absent on many
slopes and all uplands, to many meters thick in major or secondary drainages.</P>

<P>Regionally, the alluvium deposits are grouped into a classification known as the
"DeForest Formation" (Bettis 1990) which can, in turn, be divided into a series of "members"
relating to timeperiods and types of aggradation. The various alluvial members are separated
by either fluvial erosion surfaces or unconformities marked by buried soil horizons. Buried
soils are most often not traceable from one valley to another, indicating some degree of
discontinuity and localized variability in the environment during their development.</P>

<P><U>Present Landsurface Formations</U>:</P>

<P>	The topography of the greater South and East Beltways Study Area is best described
as one of gently rolling hills interspersed with flat alluvial lowlands. The hilltops are usually
rounded except for a few nearly level upland divides between drainages.</P>

<P>	The sequence of loess mantels covering southeastern Nebraska becomes thinner as
the distance from the Missouri River increases. As a result, preceding depositions outcrop
more frequently and cover larger surface areas (Elder 1969:7). Dark brown deposits of the
Gilman Formation have eroded to the surface on some uplands and terrace slopes in the
south and west reaches of the Salt Valley drainage (Soil Conservation Service 1980).
Illinoian Age Loveland Formation loess and outwash alluvium deposits of sand, sandy-gravel, and coarse-gravel outcrops in stream terrace walls and eroded surfaces at several
locations in Lancaster County. The Kansan Age granite and quartzite till, contained in a
matrix of grayish-brown clay, is visible at eroded surfaces and stream cuts at locations
throughout central, western and northern Lancaster County (Boellstorff 1978; Dillon 1992;
Forman et al. 1992).</P>

<P>	Numerous localized outcrops of bedrock are present in Lancaster County. Rusty-brown Dakota sandstone has been exposed by downcutting in several local drainages. Other
bedrock exposures occur along homoclinal ridges at stream valley margins. Uplift and
subsequent stream erosion has exposed the older Permian and Pennsylvanian limestone
bedrocks at numerous locations along the margins of the Salt Creek Valley south of Lincoln.</P>

<P><U>Modern Surface Soils</U>:</P>

<P>	Loess and glacial till are the principle inorganic parent materials for soil production
in this region of the Plains. The majority of soils in the uplands of Lancaster County are
mild-to-medium acidic mollisols described as "<EM>deep, gently-sloping to steep, moderately
well-drained to well-drained silty-soils that formed in loess and loamy-soils that formed in
glacial till</EM> (Soil Conservation Service 1980:4). In general, Mollisols are well-developed soils
with dark-brown to black, organic-rich humus A-horizons which are clearly defined from the
sterile subsoils. They maintain a rich and fertile humus complex due to the extremely dense
root zones of native Plains and Prairie vegetation. Soil moisture is adequate to encourage a
flourishing soil biota, but not overly abundant to cause nutrient leaching (Elder 1969).</P>

<P>	The floodplains of Salt Creek, Stevens Creek, and their major tributaries are
blanketed with up to 10,500 years of Holocene alluvium. Established floodplain soils in the
basins are slightly acidic-to-mildly alkaline mollisols described as "<EM>deep, nearly level to very
gently sloping, moderately well to very poorly drained, clayey to silty soils that formed in
alluvium; on floodplains" </EM>(Soil Conservation Service 1980:7). More recent bottomland
deposits, where mature soil zones have not yet developed due to periodic flooding and
continuing erosion, migration and redeposition of surface materials are neutral-to-mildly
alkaline fluvent entisols. These are immature soils developing in relatively unstable,
unconsolidated materials. Such soils have poor horizonation, gradually merging with the
sterile subsoils with no clear lines of distinction between soil zones. These locations,
however, are often very fertile and organic rich since the alluvium that formed them is, most
frequently, topsoil eroded from uplands (Elder 1969).</P>

<P><U></U><U>Regional Climatic and Vegetational Background</U>:<U></U></P>

<P>	At present, there are few detailed paleoenvironmental studies of this region of the
central Great Plains. Palynological and macrobotanical profiles are scarce because there are
few suitable Holocene deposits with sufficient time depth (Zalucha 1990). Therefore, we are
left with a somewhat ambiguous picture of Holocene climatic and vegetation changes prior
to around 9,000 years before present (Cummings 1990).</P>

<P>	There is general agreement among most paleobotanists and paleoclimatologists that
Sage (<EM>Artemisia</EM> sp.) steppes, similar to the "barren-grounds" of modern north-central
Canada, dominated the Plains at 28,000 to 22,000 years ago, during the late stages of
Wisconsinian Glaciation (Wells 1970; Wells and Stewart 1987). From 22,000 to 12,000
years before present, dense taiga-like forests of Pine (<EM>Pinus</EM> spp.) and Spruce (<EM>Picea</EM> spp.)
prevailed throughout much of the still cold southern and eastern Great Plains (Olfield and
Schoenwetter 1975:167). At the end of the Pleistocene and into the beginning of the
Holocene, from around 15,000 to 12,500 years ago, the climate warmed and became more
arid. The boreal forests were gradually replaced by a mosaic of intermixed coniferous and
deciduous woodlands (Webb, Cushing and Wright 1983). Between 12,500 and 9,000 years
ago, these forests became patchy and interspersed with constantly increasing areas of dense
grassland vegetation. By 9,000 years ago, the Great Plains was predominately grassland,
although, like today, tracts of forest grew on steep slopes along the valley margins and in
narrow belts along the meandering waterways (Baker and VanZant 1980; Semken 1980;
VanZant 1979).</P>

<P>	From approximately 8,000 to 5,000 years ago, the North American Great Plains
became severely dry and hot. Known as the Altithermal Climatic Episode (Antevs 1937,
1955), this period is now known, not as one long drought, but rather, multiple periods of
extended, many centuries-long droughts that were separated by episodes of increased
effective moisture that most probably fell as late-winter and early-spring precipitation
(Benedict 1979).</P>

<P>	In the past 5,000 years, frequent climatic oscillations have occurred across the Plains,
altering floral and faunal niches, as well as impacting the lives of the humans who depended
on those resources. Between approximately AD 1100 and 1200, the "Neo-Atlantic" event led
to a northward influx of tropical air, increasing the summer rainfall amounts and bringing
about a westward spread of woodlands.</P>

<P>	By AD 1200, continuing oscillations brought about a catastrophic degeneration of
Plains climatic conditions. This "Pacific" climatic event brought strengthened westerly winds
and drier, cooler air onto the central and northern Plains. Steppe conditions again spread
eastward, as the climate deteriorated and the prairie ecosystem retreated, leading to drastic
declines in vegetation and faunal resources on the Plains.</P>

<P>	Around AD 1500, the Plains again recovered to what we would recognize as a
"normal" climate, although, smaller regional or localized fluctuations in the climate cycles
continue. Today, the central Great Plains has a temperate, mid-continental climate typical
of that found in the interior of a large continent. Temperatures can be extreme with hot
summers, and cold winters. Both temperature and precipitation may vary greatly from year
to year and even day to day. The weather is often subject to extreme, violent, and seemingly
unpredictable fluctuations. These rapid changes in temperature and precipitation are caused
by warm, moist air masses from the south and southwest interacting with dry, cold air
moving out of the north and northwest. The majority of moisture that falls in the region in
both summer and winter, is brought by southerly winds from the warm air-masses that pick-up humidity over the Gulf of Mexico (Muller and Oberlander 1984).</P>

<P><U>Natural Vegetation at Euroamerican Arrival</U>:<U></U></P>

<P>	For most of the time between approximately 9,000 years ago and the late AD 1800's,
when the natural landcover of the Plains was broken for agriculture, nearly all of this region
supported medium-to-tall grassland vegetation (Baker and VanZant 1980; Semken 1980;
VanZant 1979). At the time of European arrival into the Plains, the predominant native
grasses on the terraces and uplands would have included little bluestem (<EM>Andropogon
scoparius</EM>), needle grasses (<EM>Stipa</EM> spp.), gramma grass (<EM>Bouteloua gracilis)</EM>, june grass
(<EM>Koeleria</EM> <EM>pyramidata</EM>), prairie dropseed (<EM>Sporobolus heterolepsis</EM>), sideoats gramma
(<EM>Bouteloua curtipendula</EM>), and buffalo grass (<EM>Buchloe dactyloides</EM>). Major bottomland grasses
included big bluestem (<EM>Andropogon gerardi)</EM>, Indian grass (<EM>Sorghastrum nutans</EM>), reed-grasses (<EM>Calamagrostis </EM>spp.), common wild rye <EM>(Secale cereale)</EM>, tall panic-grass (<EM>Panicum
virgatum</EM>), and prairie cordgrass (<EM>Spartina pectinata</EM>). Interspersed among the sea of grasses
was a rich variety of wildflowers, woody plants, and occasionally, shrubs and woody-thickets (Nebraska Statewide Arboretum 1982; Stubbendieck et al. 1986; U.S. Department
of Agriculture 1971).</P>

<P>	Throughout prehistory and into the early historic period, the grasslands have been
subject to frequent prairie-fires. Plants and animals evolving in this environment have
developed adaptations that enabled them to survive and even thrive under these conditions.
Today, modern agriculture, introduced lawn grasses, concrete, and modern development
covers much of Lancaster County. Only small, scattered remnants of undisturbed native
grasslands are still present in the region, a few small tracts of which are within the SEB
Study Area.</P>

<P>	Although the "Great American Desert" was known for its wide expanses of treeless
grasslands, areas of forest did exist throughout recent prehistoric times along waterways of
the region. Due to the increased soil moisture content along streams, seedlings were able to
weather most periodic droughts that occur in the region. In these more moist locations, trees
were able to become established and grow large enough to withstand all but the most severe
grassfires which frequented the Plains (Brown 1989; Fenneman 1931).</P>

<P>	In 1856, when John W. Prey first arrived in the Salt Valley, he described groves of
magnificent elms (<EM>Ulmus americana</EM>), huge cottonwoods (<EM>Populus </EM>sp.), and honey locusts
(<EM>Gleditsia triacanthos</EM>). "<EM>Timber hugged the banks of the stream as far as they could see</EM>" (in
Copple 1959:5). Others told about green ash (<EM>Fraxinus lanceolata</EM>), black walnut (<EM>Juglans
nigra</EM>), hackberry (<EM>Celtis occidentalis</EM>), red mulberry (<EM>Morus rubra</EM>), white oak (<EM>Quercus
alba</EM>), boxelder (<EM>Acer negundo</EM>), and American basswood (<EM>Tilia americana</EM>) groves in these
streamside woodlands (Hayes and Cox 1889; Sawyer 1916; Pound and Clements 1900). A
few ponderosa pine (<EM>Pinus ponderosa</EM>), common dwarf juniper (<EM>Juniperus communis</EM>), red
cedar (<EM>Juniperus virginiana</EM>), basswood (<EM>Tilia americana</EM>), American hazelnut (<EM>Corylus
americana</EM>), and hickories (<EM>Carya</EM> sp.) could be found on some upland slopes at valley
margins (Nebraska Statewide Arboretum 1982; Pound and Clements 1900; Sawyer 1916).
The floors of these forests were thicketed with various woody and vining plants, including
fruit bearing wild plum (<EM>Prunus americana</EM>), wild gooseberry (<EM>Ribes americanum</EM>),
chokecherry (<EM>Prunus virginiana</EM>), wild raspberry (<EM>Rubus occidentalis</EM>), and frost grape (<EM>Vitis
riparia</EM>) (Nebraska Statewide Arboretum 1982).</P>

<P>	Salt Creek and its larger tributaries have tended to meander, thereby creating a broad
floodplain dotted with oxbow lakes and alluvial point-bars. Both black willow (Salix nigra)
and sandbar willow (Salix exigua) quickly colonized the edges of the creeks. These trees
retain the soils with fibrous, matted root systems. Oxbow-cutoff lakes eventually filled with
sediments to become marshy wetlands, representing a transition between flowing water and,
eventually, dry floodplain (Soil Conservation Service 1980).</P>

<P><U>Natural Faunal Resources at Euroamerican Settlement</U>:<U></U></P>

<P>	The deep, fertile soils of greater Salt Creek Valley, with its woodlands, wetlands, and
grasslands, have created a diverse ecological system which provided abundant food, nesting,
and habitat resources for a wide variety of native animal species (Brown 1989; Nebraska
Game and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P>	The most important animal resource on the Plains was, of course, the immense free-ranging herds of bison (<EM>Bison </EM>sp.). Other large game faunal resources, including white-tailed
deer (<EM>Odocoileus virginianus</EM>), mule deer (<EM>Odocoileus hemionus</EM>), elk ("Wapati")(<EM>Cervus
elaphus</EM>), and pronghorn (<EM>Antilcapra americanus</EM>) were also present (Brown 1989; Nebraska
Game and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P>	An infinite number of bird species were common in this region of the Plains,
including a large inventory of resident and migratory waterfowl, songbirds, and predatory
or scavenging bird species. In addition to providing nesting grounds for waterfowl, area
wetlands served as stopover places for many species of migratory fowl. Upland game bird
species common to the region included bobwhite quail (<EM>Colinus virginianus</EM>), mourning dove
(<EM>Zenaida macroura</EM>), greater prairie chicken (<EM>Tympanuchus cupido</EM>), sharp-tailed grouse
(<EM>Tympanuchus phasianellus</EM>), and wild turkeys (<EM>Meleagris gallopavo</EM>) (Brown 1989;
Nebraska Game and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P>	Numerous reptiles and amphibians were found in the waters, wetlands, moist
floodplains, including the major reptile species such as the snapping turtle (<EM>Chelydra
serpentina</EM>), painted turtle (<EM>Chrysemys picta</EM>), soft-shelled turtle (<EM>Trionyx spiniferus</EM>). In the
drier uplands of the region, were western box turtle (<EM>Terrapene ornata</EM>) of the grasslands
appear to have been preyed upon by early residents of the region (Brown 1989; Nebraska
Game and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P>	At the time of Euroamerican settlement, fish species found in the waterways of
Lancaster County included largemouth bass (<EM>Micropterus salmoides</EM>), channel catfish
(<EM>Ictalurus punctatus</EM>), flathead catfish (<EM>Pylodietis olivaris</EM>), crappie (<EM>Pomoxis </EM>sp.), walleye
(<EM>Stizostedion vitreum</EM>), bullhead (<EM>Ictalurus</EM> sp<EM>.</EM>), and sunfish (<EM>Lepomis </EM>sp.) (Nebraska Game
and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P><U>Environmental Resources Available in This Region:</U></P>

<P>	The environment of eastern Nebraska, including the entirety of the SEB Study Area,
is a product of a multitude of factors that combined to create a fertile, and usually rich and
bountiful system for the plants and animals, and ultimately, for the human groups who
preyed upon them. Exposures of the Pennsylvanian and Permian limestone bedrock
frequently contain chert nodules, giving early Plains residents access to valuable lithic
resources. Likewise, outcrops of glacial tills provided access to various other workable
lithics, including quartzites, alibates, agates, and jaspers. Outcrops of Dakota Sandstone
provided prehistoric peoples with a source for abrader and grinding materials. The geology
of the region also provided a foundation for parental materials of the fertile soils. The
weathering and degrading of the limestone formations, combined with loess deposits and
organic materials, to create the fertile, mineral-rich soils of the region that, eventually, led
to the luxuriant grasslands.</P>

<P>	These grasslands, in turn, provided food and habitat for a myriad of animal resources,
upon which resident cultures, both prehistoric and historic, have preyed. Throughout the last
10,000 years, the most important animal resource for the Native residents of the Plains was
the herds of bison (<EM>Bison </EM>sp.). Zooarcheological research has also shown that other large
game faunal resources, including white-tailed deer (<EM>Odocoileus virginianus</EM>), mule deer
(<EM>Odocoileus hemionus</EM>), elk ("Wapati")(<EM>Cervus elaphus</EM>), and pronghorn (<EM>Antilcapra
americanus</EM>) played an important part in the diets of eastern Plains people. During certain
periods of prehistory, other smaller mammals abundant in the region were also preyed upon
(Brown 1989; Nebraska Game and Parks Commission 1972; Wernert 1986).</P>

<P>During some prehistoric periods, Plains residents also preyed on aquatic resources.
Following settlement of the basin many early Euroamericans depended heavily on fish as a
food source (Hayes and Cox 1889; Sawyer 1916; Wedel 1986), as well as wetland reptiles
such as the snapping turtle (<EM>Chelydra serpentina</EM>), painted turtle (<EM>Chrysemys picta</EM>), and soft-shelled turtle (<EM>Trionyx spiniferus</EM>). The wetlands of the Salt Creek, Stevens Creek, and
surrounding drainage basins were also an important source of waterfowl production, which
in turn, was an important food source for prehistoric and early historic residents of this
vicinity.</P>

<P>	The wooded acres along waterways provided prehistoric people with building
materials for the earthlodge frames, and fuel for their fires. The floors of these forests were
often thicketed with various fruit bearing trees and shrubs. These fruiting plants provided
valuable resources throughout prehistoric times and into the historic settlement period
(Hayes and Cox 1889; Sawyer 1916; Wernert 1986). Following the settlement of Lancaster
County, these streamside woodlands were quickly cut for log cabins, or sawed into lumber
for building construction materials. It was also burned as fuel for steam-mills, brick-kilns,
and in the fires of the short-lived salt production companies west of Lincoln. By the late
1860's, the vast majority of streamside forest was gone and many early settlers arrived to
find a treeless plain (Hayes and Cox 1889; McKee 1984; Sawyer 1916). In the 1870's, with
encouragement of men like J. Sterling Morton, people began planting both native and non-native species (Copple 1959). These trees provided protection as windbreaks and shade trees,
supplied wood fuel, and were aesthetically pleasing. Within a few years, portions of
Lancaster County were again forested, with the amount of woodland acreage actually
exceeding that present in prehistoric times (Nebraska Statewide Arboretum 1982; Sawyer
1916; U.S. Department of Agriculture 1977).</P>

<P><U>Environmental Summary</U>:</P>

<P>	The "Great Plains" generally brings to mind the vast, relatively flat, semiarid
grasslands that sprawl from the Mississippi valley on the east to the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains on the west. The northern Plains are bounded by the coniferous forests of the
Saskatchewan River basin in Canada, and the southern edge by the Rio-Grand&eacute; River in
Texas (Wedel 1961). Although often thought of as a relatively homogeneous environment,
this expanse of the central North American continent, with its many unique physiographic
and climatological features, forms many ecological zones, which have, through time,
supported a variety of plant and animal resources.</P>

<P>	Many of the early European and Euroamerican explorers who traveled into or across
the Great Plains were unfavorably impressed with the environment. In 1806, Lieutenant
Zebulon M. Pike, who established the route from St. Louis to Santa Fe, predicted that
America's western lands would <EM>"...become in time equally celebrated as the sandy desarts
</EM>(sic)<EM> of Africa</EM>" (Pike in Olson 1966:8), and they should be <EM>"...left to the wandering and
uncivilized aborigines</EM>" (Pike in Wedel 1961:278). Lewis Henry Morgan, an early
anthropologist, even stated that the Plains were <EM>"...a barren wasteland not congenial to the
Indian, and ...only made tolerable to him by possession of the horse and the rifle</EM>" (Morgan
in Wedel 1961:279). Alfred Kroeber, who revolutionized American thinking about Native
Americans, believed that the prehistoric Plains were <EM>"...only sparsely or intermittently
inhabited</EM>" (Kroeber in Wedel 1961:299).</P>

<P>	The idea that the central Plains, including eastern Nebraska, were relatively
unoccupied prior to the arrival of the horse and rifle continued long into the twentieth
century. In 1935, William Duncan Strong recognized the error of this belief and published
<U>An Introduction to Nebraska Archeology</U> in which he states that:</P>

<P><EM>"Despite the fact that<STRONG> geological, geographical, and faunistic considerations
all suggest the Great Plains as a highly probable home for early man in
North America</STRONG>, ...an idea seems to have been prevalent that the region had
no archeology worthy of the name"</EM> (Strong 1935:5, emphasis ours).</P>

<P>	In the years since Pike, Long, and Kroeber, we have come to recognize that, not only
are the Great Plains habitable, but they have been inhabited continuously for the past 12,000
years and possibly longer (Table 3).</P>

<P>	Since the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century settlements of the region by Euroamericans, the virgin prairies
have been plowed or paved, prairie fires controlled, waterways channelized, wetlands filled,
and dams built. In addition, exotic, sometimes ecologically aggressive plant and animal
species have been introduced, intentionally and accidentally, into the environment. Such
habitat alterations have caused populations of some indigenous plant and animal species to
decrease. By the 1850's when this region was being settled by Euroamericans, the majestic
elk, and the vast bison herds were gone from eastern Nebraska, having succumbed to over-hunting by both Indian and White fur-traders, to a dozen years of meat and sport hunting by
pioneers crossing the Plains. (Norton et al. 1984). Waterfowl production was greatly reduced
following stream channelization and oxbow filling that destroyed wetlands. Upland bird
populations decreased as natural habitat grasslands fell under the plow. Most native species,
though, have adapted and, in spite of the many environmental changes that have taken place
throughout the Salt Creek watershed, it remains, even today, quite well suited for all but a
few native wildlife species (Brown 1989; Nebraska Game and Parks Commission 1972;
Wernert 1986).</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>3. <U>General Overview of great Plains Culture-History</U></STRONG></P>

<P>	The date of human arrival into the central Great Plains is open to debate.
Conservatively, empirical evidence has shown that human groups existed throughout the
New World, including the Plains, by at least 12,000 years ago. Although some archeological
evidence exists to suggest that the first "Americans" arrived long before the 12,000 years ago
date, and many archeologist now agree that humans have been in the New World at least
20,000 years (Frison 1991; Haag 1962; Humphrey and Stanford 1979; Willey and Sabloff
1980). In the central Plains, several sites deeply buried in the Peorian Loess of the
Republican River drainage of southern Nebraska suggest pre-17,000 BP occupations in this
region of the Great Plains (Holen 1995).</P>

<P><U>Paleoindian Period</U> (12,000+ to 8,000 years ago):</P>

<P>	The earliest universally accepted New World cultural tradition is that of the "Clovis"
people who lived approximately 12,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene "Ice Age,"
during what is known as the "New World Paleolithic" (Braidwood 1964; Harris 1993), or
"Paleoindian" period. Cultural remains of Clovis people have been found across the eastern
two-thirds of North America. Armed only with stone tipped spears, Clovis people were
hunters of gigantic mammoths (<EM>Mammuthus</EM> spp.) and other Pleistocene megafauna. They
are thought to have lived in small groups of highly nomadic hunters, moving their families
and camps to the vicinity of large kills; following the herds. We have no evidence of
structural remains, no food storage patterns, and no hearths to indicate sustained, continuous
site use; although there is evidence that Clovis peoples returned at irregular intervals for
short-term reoccupation of certain campsites near rich resource bases (Gunnerson 1984,
1987; Stanford 1979).</P>

<P>	Following the age of the Clovis complex mammoth hunters were numerous other Big
Game hunting groups armed with a variety of finely worked points. The different point styles
of Folsom, Hell Gap, Scottsbluff and other Late Paleoindian complexes, undoubtedly
represent related, but separate regional traditions. Like earlier Clovis people, they are thought
to have been highly nomadic groups; following and relying heavily on herds of extinct forms
of Bison (<EM>Bison antiquus </EM>and<EM> B. occidentalis</EM>), although other Pleistocene animals were also
preyed upon. Faunal remains from archeological sites in the Plains include the extinct
American Horse (<EM>Equus</EM> sp.), Western Camel (<EM>Camelops hesternus</EM>), Woodland Musk Ox
(<EM>Symos cavifrons</EM>), giant beaver (<EM>Castoroides ohioensis</EM>), and giant sloth (<EM>Northrotheriops
shastensis</EM>) (Agenbroad 1973, 1974; Roberts 1935, 1939).</P>

<P><U>Archaic Period</U> (8,000 to 2,000 years ago):</P>

<P>	By around 8,000 years ago, the age of the "Big-game hunter" traditions had passed.
Major climatic shifts taking place across the entire central North American continent during
the period between 8,000 and 5,000 years ago resulted in a severe warming and drying of the
Great Plains to their Holocene maximum. Known as the "Altithermal Climatic Episode,"
these climate changes greatly altered the range and quantity of both plant and animal species
(Antevs 1955). In turn, humans present on the Plains and dependent on those resources were
affected during the Early Archaic Period (Gunnerson 1987).</P>

<P>	At one time, researchers thought the Plains became completely devoid of human
occupation during that portion of the Archaic Period (Mulloy 1958). It has now been
recognized, however, that while Plains populations were reduced and lifestyles altered,
occupation of the Plains continued throughout the Altithermal Episode (Fagan 1991; Frison
1978; Frison and Wilson 1975). Evidence suggests that populations in the western Great
Plains were reduced as people sought refuge in the more moist foothills and High Plains
plateaus of the Rocky Mountains. Excursions were made onto the Plains in search of animal
resources (Benedict 1991: Benedict and Olson 1978 Frison 1991; Frison and Walker 1984;
Greiser et al. 1983; Swanson et al. 1964). Populations in the eastern Plains were also reduced
as the carrying capacity of the environment declined. Remaining populations may have
become seasonally sedentary as they concentrated around permanent, reliable water sources
during the worst of the Altithermal Episodes (Anderson and Semken 1980; Baker and
VanZant 1980; Frison 1978; Frison and Wilson 1975). Investigations at the Logan Creek
site, 25BT3, in Burt County, Nebraska, have revealed that the southern portion of the Logan
Creek valley in eastern Nebraska was one location capable of supplying the necessary
resources for long-term, or at least repeated occupations of that site (Carlson 1992; Kivett
1962; Mandel 1992b).</P>

<P>	The changes in resource availability forced a shift in subsistence technologies by the
people living in this region and a new form of "broad spectrum" (Flannery 1965) subsistence
appeared as group's broadened their diet-breadth. As primary resources are restricted, hunters
are eventually forced to include smaller prey and exploit a wider variety of animal species.
Groups <EM>"...make use of increasing numbers of small food packages to compensate for the
more specialized </EM>(but no longer viable)<EM> strategies"</EM> (Binford 1983:212). For the first time on
the Great Plains, gathered plant foods became a significant supplement to hunted food
resources. Many Plains sites that date to the early Archaic Period reflect this broad spectrum
subsistence adaptation and include remains from a much wider range of hunted food
resources (Frison 1991; Greiser et al. 1983; Swanson et al. 1964; Thompson and Bettis 1980;
Wedel 1940, 1961). Eastern Plains sites often reflect some broadening of subsistence
strategies, although at certain sites bison continued to dominate as the primary hunted
resource (Anderson and Semken 1980; Baker and VanZant 1980; Carlson 1992; Hoyer
1980).</P>

<P>As the effect of the Altithermal Episode lessened and the environment returned to a
cooler and moister climate around 5,000 BP, larger populations again returned to the Plains.
As Great Plains culture complexes grew and developed, they began to reflect distinct,
regional, and localized subsistence strategies. Western Plains cultures returned to a form of
nomadic big-game hunter-gather subsistence; largely dependent upon the modern bison
species (<EM>Bison bison</EM>) (Gunnerson 1987). Although eastern and central Plains diets were
heavily dependent on the bison, these cultures remained broad spectrum foraging economies
subsisting on a highly diversified diet, with a partial dependence on smaller hunted game
such as deer and rabbits. Collected plant foods, some of which were dried and ground into
flour with milling stones, remained an important part of the economy, and fishing also
became an integral part of many subsistence strategies (Wedel 1986).</P>

<P><U>Woodland Period</U> (2,000 to 1,000 years ago):</P>

<P>	While artifact assemblages dated to the very early Woodland Period resemble
assemblages from the Late Archaic, it was a time when rapid cultural and technological
change was beginning to take place, and Plains lifestyles were soon to be much different
from those of past Plains dwellers (Gunnerson 1984). Through cultural diffusion and long
distance trade, evidence of which first appears on the Plains at this time, Woodland cultures
were heavily influenced by cultural developments occurring east of the Great Plains in the
Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys among the Adena and Hopewell cultures (Wedel
1986:81). The cultures of the Plains Woodland Period are largely a result of the well-documented inter-regional exchange of ideas, technologies, artifacts, raw materials, and
exotic items with cultures outside of the Plains area (Benn 1980, 1990; Frison 1991;
Hoffman and Brooks 1989).</P>

<P>	A major development to appear on the Plains at this time is permanent-structure
housing. These houses were often loosely grouped in small, diffuse settlements near easily
tillable land and permanent water sources. The homes of Woodland people were circular,
shallow pits with roofs supported by central wooden posts. A framework of wood poles
covered the central support posts, and smaller branches were laid across this framework
(Haas 1983; Hill and Kivett 1941; Wedel 1986).</P>

<P>	Pottery also first appears on the Plains at this time. Woodland pottery is relatively
simple and thick-walled, but sturdy and comparatively well made. Pottery styles resemble
those found in sites east of the Plains (Gunnerson 1984). Woodland pottery is conical or
globular with no flattened bottom for standing the vessel up, requiring the vessel to be either
hung from a cord holder, or placed in a depression dug into the ground. These early Plains </P>

<P>vessels were often cord impressed using a cord wrapped paddle. This "decoration" may be
a result of compressing the surface of the vessel for strengthening, rather than for aesthetic
reasons.</P>

<P>	The presence of these new adaptations indicates at least semi-sedentary lifestyles
which, in turn, suggests some type of horticulture (Gunnerson 1984, 1987; Wedel 1986). The
early Woodland Period was characterized by incipient horticulture subsidizing a largely
hunting and gathering subsistence. As time passed, horticulture products became a larger part
of the diet in the eastern Plains complexes. Evidence of "corn" (a chaplet derivative of <EM>Zea
mays</EM>) has been found in late Woodland sites, although at that time it was still being
experimented with and did not become a major staple until much later (Wedel 1986).</P>

<P>Certain groups appear to have been located in more optimal areas for floodplain
horticulture, resulting locally identifiable, specialized technological complexes, and leading
to more complex social organizations evident in the Plains Village Period (Alex 1981;
Anfinson 1982).</P>

<P><U>Plains Village Period</U> (1000 years ago to ca. AD 1600):</P>

<P>	The Plains Village Period was a result of a flourishing of technological, and cultural
developments that began in the Woodland Period, creating a relatively affluent and bountiful
time on the central and eastern Plains. The introduction, acceptance, and success of
horticulture resulted relative resource abundance, leading to a more sedentary lifestyle, which
in turn led to populations increasing dramatically during the early Plains Village Period.
Population densities between approximately 900 and 700 years ago were the greatest of
anytime during prehistory (Gunnerson 1984, 1987; Strong 1935).</P>

<P>Evidence has been interpreted to suggest that the advanced technologies, ceramic
forms, and cultural complexities that define the Plains Village Period developed out of the
preceding Woodland Traditions (Wedel 1961, 1981). More recent interpretations (Eighmy
1994; Emerson 1991; Gibbon 1994; O'Brien 1994; Winham and Lueck 1994; Vehik, S.
1994), however, have suggested that many aspects of this later period was introduced
through migrations and diffusion out of the Mississippian cultural complexes far to the east.</P>

<P>Within the central Great Plains, a large number of roughly contemporaneous, but
distinct, localized, or regional variants developed and have been identified. Collectively,
however, all are recognized as sharing an abundance of cultural material traits. In common,
they share a settlement pattern and subsistence technology that is based on simple
horticulture (Krause 1969; Gunnerson 1984; Lehmer 1954; Wedel 1959). Similarities
between Plains Village cultures located within the very central Plains region and their
distinction from groups outside of this region has led to a "Central Plains Tradition"
grouping of cultures (Blakeslee 1978; Blakeslee and Caldwell 1979; Gunnerson 1984).
People of the Central Plains Tradition built large rectangular, multi-family earthlodges from
6 to 14 meters (20 to 45 ft) across. Like earlier housing, they were built over shallow
depressions with roofs supported on central posts. The lodges were covered with earth and
sodded over, making them cool in summer, and warm in winter. Houses were located either
singularly, or in small clusters, on ridges and terraces near reliable waterways and easily
tilled bottomlands (Wedel 1959).</P>

<P>	An ecologically determined, seasonal pattern of subsistence strategies has been
identified and well documented throughout the Tallgrass Prairie portions of the eastern Great
Plains such as present-day eastern Nebraska. Semi-sedentary, horticulturalists occupied
earthlodge villages near small bottomland gardens part of the year while producing the
triumvirate, corn (<EM>Zea mays</EM>), beans (<EM>Phaseolus vulgaris</EM>), and squash (<EM>Cucurbita</EM> spp.)
domesticated crop that they supplemented with a wide variety of wild plants resources. Food
was plentiful, and was dried and stored in subterranean pits dug into the floors of the
earthlodges. The remainder of the year was spent following more mobile subsistence
strategies. Extended hunting and gathering trips westward, away from the villages, were
likely coordinated with seasonal movement of large bison herds and supplied much of their
annual meat resources (Wedel 1986).</P>

<P>	An abundance of other new ideas and technologies appear in the archeological record
of the Plains of this period. The bow and arrow, introduced during late Woodland, quickly
replaced the spear and/or atlatl dart as the hunter's weapon of choice. A broader range of
artifacts made from stone, bone, horn and shell are found at sites dating to this period. The
appearances of bone fishhooks indicate that fishing became a major contributor to Plains
Village Period diets. Perhaps the most distinguishing artifact, to make an appearance, and
indeed the hallmark of this period, is the bison scapula hoe used in the horticulture of
bottomlands, and in digging storage pits and earthlodge floors.</P>

<P>	The more arid western Shortgrass Plains were, for the most part, not suitable for
horticultural based subsistence strategies, but did provide ample grazing for immense herds
of bison. As a result, pedestrian nomadic hunting and gathering culture complexes,
contemporaneous with the horticulturalist eastern Plains cultures, developed and occupied
the drier western Great Plains. This dual pattern of Plains subsistence technologies became
more intense toward the end of the Plains Village Period, continuing in altered forms through
the Protohistoric and into the Historic Periods.</P>

<P>	The climatic deterioration of the Pacific climatic event (ca. AD 1200) brought about
catastrophic environmental degeneration and drastic declines in vegetation and faunal
resources on the Plains. These resulted in humans virtually abandoning the Plains core, and
crowding within stable resource areas. As the climate and environment recovered, new ethnic
arrivals, nomadic Athapaskans from the north filled this void, adding to the crowding
conditions.</P>

<P>The diffuse village patterns common during the early Village Period were abandoned
in favor of larger, more consolidated settlements that were easier to defend. Villages were
often fortified with ditches, earthenworks, or stockades, reflecting overcrowding,
encroachment by hostile groups, and intense, violent competition between these Late Plains
Village Period groups. The concentration of populations into fewer, but larger and more
densely occupied villages may have created greater economic and social stability for the
people; which resulted in the fluorescence of their cultures as seen in the archeological
record. The elaborate cultures of the Plains Village farmers were at their heights when the
first European explorers, missionaries, and fur traders made their way up the river channels
and into the Plains.</P>

<P>The newly arrived Athapaskan speakers introduced circular, temporary, skin covered
housing, now known as the "tipi," (Gunnerson 1984) was adopted by other nomadic groups,
providing transportable, but weather-tight housing.</P>

<P><U>Protohistoric Period</U> (roughly AD 1600 to early 1800's on the central Great Plains):</P>

<P>	The Protohistoric period of the Plains is typically characterized by that brief period
when there was an infusion of White tradegoods into Native American cultures without
intensive White presence.</P>

<P>	Recognizing that possession of horses would strengthen the military abilities of
Native Americans, official Spanish policy outlawed trade of horses to Indians. To further
prevent Indians from coming into possession of horse herds, the Spanish military directed
expeditions to use geldings which, if stolen, or lost, could not be bred. This policy was
clearly violated though. During Coronado's exploration through the Southwest in 1540,
enslaved Pueblo Indians cared for horses owned by the Spaniards (Haines 1938). Some
Pueblo escaped, apparently taking with them fertile Spanish horses that they bred and, within
a few years, began trading to other Indian groups. While there is considerable controversy
over the exact means by which Indians came to own herds of horses, one thing is eminently
clear; horses became a large part of Native American Plains cultures shortly after Coronado's
explorations (Ewers 1968).</P>

<P>	During the next century, Algonkian and Siouan tribes, who were formerly residing
east of the Plains in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys, or northeast, in the Red River
Valley </P>

<P>east to the Great Lakes area, were being pushed south and west by better armed tribes to the
north and east who had acquired guns from French and New England traders and settlers
(Ewers 1968). Eventually the gun came into the possession of tribes moving onto the Plains.
This unique set of circumstances caused the convergence on the Plains of the horse, from the
Southwest, and the gun, from the Northeast. The combination forever changed the pattern
of existence among the Native Plains people.</P>

<P>	The combination of the horse and gun had a tremendous impact on Native Plains
cultures. These increased geographic ranges encroached upon, and threatened the traditional
hunting and territorial boundaries of other, often distant tribes, intensifying the level of
hostility between Native groups that, previously, had only rare contact (Ewers 1968). In
addition, with the horse, a hunter could travel much farther and kill far more animals than
he could on foot. Coinciding with the fur trade, the equestrian bison hunters initiated the
wholesale slaughter of the seemingly endless bison herds in exchange for tradegoods
supplied by the growing Euroamerican populations to the east.</P>

<P>	Although the horse and gun were the most important and culturally influential of the
White tradegoods, other items also came to be in high demand. Utilitarian goods such as
axes, steel knives, firesteels, pots, pans, and other household utensils were highly desired by
Plains people, as were cloth, buttons, beads and other items of adornment. Trade routes that
had been established early in prehistory, served to rapidly transport Euroamerican goods
throughout the Plains. During the early 1700's, French fur traders began to penetrate the
northeastern Plains to visit upper Missouri Plains tribes in an attempt to set up trade centers.
In 1738, Pierre LaVerendrye, a French trader who was one of the first Europeans to enter the
region, visited a large, fortified earthlodge village belonging to the Mandan on the northern
Missouri River. Along with the aboriginal trade of cultivated and hunted resources, he noted
that the northern Plains tribes already owned and traded a wealth of both guns and horses
(Ewers 1968). In exchange for these tradegoods, Native Plains people entered into the fur </P>

<P>trade wholeheartedly. With this new "wealth" brought about by fur trade, began the demise
of the great bison herds upon which the Plains Indians were dependent and, subsequently,
the demise of Native cultures.</P>

<P><U>Native Americans During the Historic Period</U> (ca. 1800 to present on Plains):</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	Throughout many years of Spanish and French trading and exploration on the Plains,
they made little direct impression upon the land and their influence on the Native Plains
peoples was mostly limited to that of the itinerant trader who provided the goods by which
Plains society was altered. (Olson 1966). Toward the middle of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century, however,
large scale fur traders began to operate along the Missouri and its tributaries, and the impact
became more profound. Juan Munier was given exclusive trading license with the Ponca at
the mouth of the Niobrara River. Jacques Mackay established a trading post with the Oto and
Pawnee at the mouth of the Platte (Wesley 1949), and Fort Charles, a trade fort, near the big
Omaha village of <EM>Ton wa Tonga</EM> in present day Dakota County, Nebraska (O'Shea and
Ludwickson 1992).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	With the United States' 1804 purchase of the Louisiana territory from France, the
history and face of the land and peoples of the Plains was nearing abrupt change. The scale
of trade on the Plains grew even larger under United States Government control. Manual Lisa
and his St. Louis Missouri Fur Company, moved up the Missouri and into the Yellowstone
area, flooding the region with White tradegoods in exchange for furs collected by the Plains
Indians. Trade briefly subsided during the War of 1812. At the end of the war, the United
States War Department established numerous forts along the Missouri to protect fur traders,
counteract remaining British influence among the native peoples, and to enforce treaties
recently signed with various Plains Indian tribes (Ewer 1968).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	Reports from early European explorers who traveled onto the Great Plains had always
spoken of vast and uninhabitable expanses of land between the Missouri River and the Rocky
Mountains. In 1820, when Major Stephen Long of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
returned from his expedition to the Rocky Mountains, he wrote:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><EM>	"I do not hesitate in giving the opinion that it is almost wholly unfit for
cultivation, and of course, uninhabitable by a people depending on agriculture for
their subsistence. This extensive section of country </EM>(is)<EM> an unfit residence for any
but a nomad population"</EM> (Long from Olson 1966:3).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	Such reports had originally steeled in the minds of the growing Euroamerican population
in the east that the American Great Plains were, in fact, "The Great American Desert." As
such, the Plains seemed to be the answer to the problem of the Indian population. It soon
became popular opinion, and briefly official government policy, that, since civilized people
could not live there, the Plains would become a permanent Indian frontier; the homeland of
the American "savage" (Norton et al. 1984).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	The establishment of forts and a military occupation of the Plains, however, provided
opportunity to experiment with agriculture. Rather than failing miserably as predicted, crops
at Fort Atkinson, north of present day Fort Calhoun, Nebraska, flourished. Crop production
increased annually and milk cows and beef cattle herds grew. This angered some who, like
Military Inspector George Croghan, argued that the army was <EM>"...destroying military spirit
and making officers the base overseers of a troop of awkward ploughmen"</EM> (quoted in Wesley
1949:30). From a military standpoint, the agricultural experiments may not have been
productive, but they did prove that the Plains, previously thought of as the "Great American
Desert," could indeed be fruitful. The forts and trading posts were expanding and becoming
small oases for Euroamericans, providing centers of "civilization" with gardens, tailors,
gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and all the needs for a steadily growing population of
Euroamericans. This attracted the attention of the Euroamerican populations in the east,
whose changing perceptions of the Plains began to threaten the idea of an Indian "homeland."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	The 1834 Indian Intercourse Act had intended to prohibit additional non-Native people
from trespassing on Indian lands without a government license, and was aimed at saving the
Plains for the Natives. Consequently, settlers could not legally take up residence on the
Plains. Continued interest in lands to settle began to focus on Oregon. An "Oregon
Emigration Society" was organized in Massachusetts, in 1838, and others soon developed
elsewhere. Newspapers and pamphlets urged the United States to assert its "manifest destiny"
rights to Oregon. By the 1840's, the Plains Indian territory was no longer west of the United
States, but right in the middle, presenting a barrier to "progress" (Olson 1966). Table 2
presents an overview of the cultural sequence of Plains cultural periods, showing the main
features that typify each period.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><U>Post-Contact Native American Tribes in Eastern Nebraska</U>:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>At the time of European arrival onto the Plains, the predominant Indian cultures
occupying the region that became eastern Nebraska were the Pawnee, Oto, Omaha, and
Ponca. Other groups frequented this area on hunting forays, inter-tribal raids, or passing
through in search of raw material resources. The salt basin west of present-day Lincoln,
which lured the first Europeans to the region, had, likewise, attracted Indian groups.
Throughout early historic times, most likely for centuries, Native groups traveled long
distances to gather the valuable salt at the basin. In addition, since at least Archaic times (ca.
8,000 BP), prehistoric groups have frequented the "Nehawka quarries" in Cass County. At
that location, Pennsylvanian limestone outcrops along several miles of ridge. Contained in
the limestone is a very high quality chert that was much sought after by Plains residents as
an item of significant value, for either manufacture of tools, or as a trade item. The following
is a brief summary of the Native American tribes that dominated the history of the region that
became eastern Nebraska.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Early accounts by Spanish and French explorers and missionaries in the 1600-1700's
documented the lifeways of the Plains Village people at the height of their cultural apex.
Their earthlodge villages were generally located along waterways where the women
cultivated the easily tillable slopes of the stream terraces with digging sticks, bison scapula
hoes, and antler rakes. They planted corn (<EM>Zea mays</EM>), beans (<EM>Amphicarpa</EM> sp.), squash and
pumpkins (<EM>Cucurbita</EM> spp.), and sunflowers (<EM>Helianthus annuus</EM>). They also gathered wild
plant resources, including prairie turnips (<EM>Psoralea esculenta</EM>), groundnuts (<EM>Apios
americana</EM>), Jerusalem artichoke (<EM>Helianthus tuberosus</EM>), morning glory (<EM>Ipomoea</EM> spp<EM>.</EM>), wild
plums (<EM>Prunus americana</EM>) choke cherries (<EM>Prunus virginiana</EM>), as well as cattail (Typha
spp.), bulrush (Scirpus spp.), and Arrowhead (<EM>Sagittaria latifolia</EM>) tubers. The men hunted
wild game, and prepared for biannual long-range bison hunts, during which they lived the
nomadic phase of their annual life. The summer hunt occurred in June through August, after
the second hoeing of their gardens, but prior to harvest. The winter hunt followed the harvest,
and the drying and storing of crops.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><U>Pawnee</U>:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	The Native American concept of land "ownership" differed greatly from that of
Euroamericans, however, prior to the onslaught of European diseases and encroachment of
other Native cultures, the powerful Pawnee "owned" or certainly claimed and defended the
majority of the region that became eastern Nebraska. The territory claimed by the Pawnee
centered around the "core" area, in central and eastern Nebraska and northern Kansas where
their permanent earthlodge villages, croplands, and their most-sacred sites were located.
Their territory then extended outwards, encompassing the range of hunting grounds, the
peripheries of which overlapped territories of surrounding tribes (Wishart 1984:11).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	Prior to the 1830's, the Pawnee nation was the most powerful Native group on the central
Plains. The population of the four bands of the Pawnee nation may have numbered as high
as 25,000 (Wishart 1984:10), though other estimates are lower (Mooney in Parks et.al
1980:289). Pawnee warriors from southeastern Nebraska raided as far south as the Santa Fe
Trail and Mexican settlements on the upper Rio Grande River. However, the decline of the
Pawnee tribe was rapid and 1831 was a turning point for the Pawnee people, when one-half
of the tribe died from smallpox. John Dougherty, the Pawnee agent who lived among them
that summer, stated that "<EM>…not one under 33 years of age escaped this monstrous disease…</EM>"
(quoted in Wishart 1984:13). Epidemics of smallpox returned in 1837 and 1838. By 1839,
their population had been reduced to fewer than 6,500.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Weakened by disease, the Pawnee were further harassed by raiding from traditional
enemies. The powerful nomadic Sioux prevented the Pawnee from traveling west or north
to hunt much needed bison. Euroamerican emigrants traveling westward along and south of
the Platte River were rapidly depleting the reserves of timber, grass, and game. In 1843, the
westward migration of Whites to Oregon increased, and to survive, the impoverished Pawnee
were left to beg and pilfer along the trails. In 1849, cholera spread among the remaining
Pawnee leaving less than 1,600 people. Sick, destitute and starving, the Pawnee began a
sequence of ceding pieces of their traditional territory to the U.S. Government in exchange
for assistance and protection from their enemies.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Originally placed on a reservation at the abandoned Mormon village of Genoa,
Nebraska, the Pawnee were still under constant pressure from Sioux raids. In August of
1873, a Pawnee hunting party of 250 men, 100 women, and 50 children attempted to make
a summer bison hunt in western Nebraska. While near present-day Trenton, they were
attacked by roughly 100 Sioux warriors, the Pawnee men rushed their women, children, and
horses loaded with hides and meat into a canyon, then set-up a defensive line, hoping to repel
the attackers. The Pawnee put up a good fight for an hour or more, until their defense was
overrun by a second attack of more than 800 mounted Sioux warriors. In a desperate attempt
to escape, the men cut the packs of meat, hides, and supplies from the horses, loaded up the
women and children, and began a frantic, bloody retreat south towards the Republican River.
The heavily armed Sioux continued to rain bullets and arrows down from the canyon rim,
breaking off the attack only after the arrival of a cavalry troop. After the fighting, the ravine
(from that time on known as "Massacre Canyon") and the plain leading to the Republican
River, was littered with the dead and mutilated bodies of more than 100 Pawnee, at least half
of them women or children.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>In 1874, the once mighty Pawnee Nation, crowded by encroaching tribes, their
numbers depleted by disease, famine, and warfare, finally resigned themselves to abandoning
their centuries old homelands, and ceded their final claims to all land in Nebraska. Shortly
after, they were removed to the Indian Territories in Oklahoma.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><U>Omaha</U>:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Between AD 1500 and 1600, there began an encroachment of Siouan speaking people
into the area that became Nebraska, including the ancestors of the Dhegiha dialect of Siouan
speaking Omaha and Ponca. Prior to the Omaha migration to Nebraska, their prehistory is
somewhat vague. Tribal legend places the Omaha homeland in the Ohio River valley,
although there is a paucity of archeological evidence to support this. It has been suggested,
again with little direct empirical support, that from approximately AD 800 to 1400, the
Dhegiha groups had been woodland farmers of the "Middle Mississippian" cultural sphere
that developed in the vicinity of present-day eastern Missouri (O'Shea and Ludwickson
1992). Prior to their migration to what became Nebraska, and probably until the later 1600's,
the Omaha and Ponca appear to have been one people. At some point, intratribal rivalry
divided the tribe and the Ponca separated from the Omaha.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	The earliest well-documented location of the Omaha is from 1670 when the French
expedition headed by Marquette and Joliet placed the "<EM>Maha</EM>" in horticultural villages along
the Missouri River. In 1700, Pierre Charles le Sueur reported them to be living on the Big
Sioux River at the "Blood Run Site" below present-day Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Sometime after 1714, the Omaha moved again, settling in a village on Bow Creek in Cedar
County, Nebraska. Regardless of their original homeland, the Omaha were already
knowledgeable horticulturalists, and once on the Plains, they readily adapted to the more arid
environment, quickly developing a lifestyle as horticulturalist bison hunters, very similar to
the well established Caddoan Plains dwellers (Welsch 1984).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>From Bow Creek, the Omaha moved to a location near present-day Dakota City,
Nebraska, but relocated several more times between 1750 and 1854, occupying a series of
sites in eastern Nebraska, including the well documented "Big Village" <EM>Ton wa Tonga</EM>, near
present-day Homer, Nebraska (O'Shea and Ludwickson 1992). The Omaha were constantly
harassed by warfare with, first, the Algonkian speaking Sauk and Fox tribes from the south,
and later by the nomadic Siouan Lakota from the north. In addition, the Omaha people
suffered great losses to smallpox epidemics, one of which struck in 1800, killing more than
400 Omaha, including the great chief Black Bird. In 1700, Pierre Charles le Sueur reported
the Omaha to have a population of roughly 4,000 people (Olson 1966). By 1854, through
warfare, famine, and disease, their population had plummeted to just over 1,000 people
(Parks et. al 1980). </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Seeking military protection from their traditional enemies, and government subsidy
assistance, the Omaha people ceded the majority of their traditional lands to the U.S.
Government on March 16, 1854. A small tract of land was kept in what is now eastern
Thurston County, Nebraska measuring 18 by 30 miles (47 by 78 Km) (Olson 1966). The
Omaha Reservation along the Missouri River is hilly and was unsuited to traditional Omaha
farming methods, but they did manage to raise crops along the stream bottoms and, with
government assistance, were able to feed themselves.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><U>Ponca:</U></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>The earliest documented location for the Ponca as a separate people, is from Pierre
Charles le Sueur who places them along the Missouri River in 1701, where they, like their
Omaha kin, lived semi-sedentary lifestyles of the hunter-horticulturalist. In 1789,
approximately 800 Ponca (Parks et. al 1980:293) were residing at the "Ponca Fort Site,"
25KX1 (Wood 1994), at the confluence of the Niobrara River with the Missouri when Juan
Baptiste Munier established a government licensed trading post at that location. Shortly after
Munier and other traders arrived, the Ponca suffered an outbreak of smallpox, loosing a great
number of their tribe. When the Lewis and Clark expedition contacted the Ponca in 1804,
they estimated a population of only 200. Their numbers recovered quickly, though, and by
1842, they again numbered nearly 800 (Olson 1966).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	After 1850, the Ponca, like the Pawnee and Omaha, were under constant pressure from
the nomadic Sioux tribes. In 1858, in an attempt to gain the protection of the U.S.
Government, the Ponca relinquished all their traditional land except for a small reservation
along the Niobrara River. Harassment from the Sioux continued, however, and then, to
compound their problems, an error in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie gave the Ponca
reservation land to the more powerful and numerous Sioux. To resolve the problem, the
government ordered the Ponca to relinquish their Nebraska holdings, and move to the Indian
Territories in Oklahoma. </P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>The majority of Ponca did not want to leave their homes, but were forced to move
by the U.S. Army. Upon arriving in Oklahoma, they began dying of malaria. The Ponca
chief, Standing Bear, lost his son to the disease, and requested permission to return home to
the Niobrara River to bury him. Originally denied permission, Standing Bear defied authority
and traveled north with a small group of Ponca and the body of his son. They stopped at the
Omaha Reservation to rest, but federal troops arrived with orders to return the "renegades"
to Oklahoma. Newspapers spread the Ponca story and, surprisingly, public sentiment sided
with the Standing Bear's group.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>With the help of Senators Algernon Paddock of Nebraska and H.M. Teller of
Colorado, as well as a group of Omaha, Nebraska attorneys, Standing Bear brought a lawsuit
against the U.S. Government. It became a test case to determine if an Indian was a person
within the eyes of the law, and entitled to Constitutionally guaranteed rights, or if the
government can confine a free man to a reservation against his will.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>During this trial, Standing Bear made a simple but persuasive argument for his case.
Holding his hand up before the court, he proclaimed: "<EM>That hand is not the color of your
hand, but if I pierce it I shall feel pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same
color as yours. I am a man!</EM>" (Standing Bear quoted in Blaine 1984:97).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>In May 1879, Judge Elmer Dundy ruled in favor of Standing Bear, ordering that the
Ponca should be released, and declaring that no authority existed to remove Indians from
their lands without their consent. On March 3, 1881, Congress appropriated money to pay
for Ponca losses, and returned the reservation lands near the Missouri River (Wooley 1984).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>Oto</U>:<U></U></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	The Oto are of the Chiwere dialect of the Siouan family of languages, closely related to
the Missouria, and more distantly, the Iowa, and Winnebago. Until the early 1600's, the
Chiwere appear to have made up a single nation occupying a region near the Great Lakes
(Wooley 1984:36). At that time, the Oto, Missouria, and Iowa separated from the Winnebago
and migrated westward. The Iowa settled in what became south central Iowa. The Oto and
Missouria are thought to have followed the Mississippi to the mouth of the Missouri River.
The Oto continued up the Missouri, forming a separate group, and eventually migrating as
far as eastern Nebraska. In 1673, Marquette documented them west of the Missouri River
between the 40<SUP>th</SUP> and 41<SUP>st</SUP> latitude (Whitman 1937). In 1714, Bourgmond placed the Oto at
the "Ashland Site," 25CC1, at the mouth of Salt Creek near Ashland, Nebraska.  By 1721,
the Oto were living on the southern bank near the mouth of the Platte River where they were
visited by the 1804 Louis and Clark expedition (Wooley 1984:36). Documents from Jacques
Mackay, who established a trading post with the Oto and Pawnee at the mouth of the Platte
(Wesley 1949), indicate that the majority of Oto lived in four villages, each consisting of 40
to 70 lodges, along the southern bank of the Platte, or western bank of the Missouri Rivers.
Their lifestyles were similar to other semi-sedentary horticulturalists in the central Plains,
relying heavily on domestic crop resources that were supplemented by two bison hunts each
year.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Around 1730, Algonkian speaking Sauk and Fox people began repeated attacks on the
Missouria, forcing a series of migrations farther westward, into what became central
Missouri. In 1780, the populations of both the Oto and Missouria still exceeded 1,000 people
(Parks et. al 1980:285). The attacks by the Sauk and Fox, and epidemics of smallpox,
however, decimate the tribes. In 1798, a Sauk and Fox attack nearly wiped out the few
remaining Missouria. The survivors divided and fled, joining other tribes for protection.
Most Missouria sought refuge with their Oto kin and by 1819, the Missouria merged so
completely, they were considered to again be one nation.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Their traditional enemies, the Sauk and Fox, continued harassment of the Oto and
repeated outbreaks of disease continued to reduce their population. In addition, resources
were being rapidly depleted as fur traders, both white and Indian, pushing the bison to the
edge of extinction, and leaving few herds to be found on the biannual hunts. Like the Omaha
and Pawnee, Oto hunting parties were also subjected to attack by the nomadic Lakota and
Arapaho. In 1874, the Oto held their final summer hunt, but were no longer able to defend
themselves against the nomads. In 1881, resigned to seeking assistance from the U.S.
Government, they ceded their remaining claims to all land in Nebraska, and the roughly 350
surviving Oto were placed on a reservation in Oklahoma (Wolley 1984).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>The Nomads</U>:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Between AD 1450 and 1800, there were multiple influxes onto the Plains, of nomadic
cultural groups. These nomad hunters resided on the short grass Prairies and western High
Plains where horticulture was not feasible, their lives tied inextricably to the herds of bison.
Although not residing in eastern Nebraska, their presence on the Plains greatly impacted the
Native groups living here, and they helped shape the late prehistory and early history of
eastern Nebraska.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>Athapaskans</U>:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	The first influx occurred sometime around 1450 when groups of Athapaskan speakers
began a series of migrations southward, to occupy the Plains areas that had been abandoned
during the Pacific Climatic Episode. By 1525, they had spread as far south as the Rio Grande
River. Ancestors of the Apache, Lipan, and Navaho, they had previously been pedestrian-nomad caribou hunters to the far north in Canada, and their technologies were efficient and
well suited to the nomadic lifestyle. Bringing with them a large breed of dog used to carry
packs, or to pull a travois, and living in sewn-skin tents, the "<EM>tipi,</EM>" which provided weather-tight, yet easily movable shelter, they were pre-adapted to the life of full-time nomadic
hunting, and simply shifted from caribou to bison hunting.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>The Athapaskans were one of the first Plains Natives to come into possession of
horses, giving them a clear military advantage over other, unmounted Plains groups. By
1650, the Apache were acting as slave traders, supplying Plains Indians to the Spanish for
labor in the Southwest, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The Pawnee from eastern Nebraska were
among those most frequently preyed upon by the slavers and for nearly 100 years, there was
a nearly constant and bloody conflict between the two cultures.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>By the time of U.S. arrival into the region that became Nebraska, the Apache were
far to the southwest, and no longer thought of as a Plains tribe. However, the technologies
and methods introduced by the Athapaskans enabled the lives of those nomadic bison-hunters who followed.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>Siouan and Algonkian Nomads</U>:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>Many of the Algonkian and Siouan groups that history recognizes as "Plains" Indians
were residing in various regions northeast of the Plains before the 17<SUP>th</SUP> century. Some of these
people lived as sedentary woodland horticulturalists, and other groups were pedestrian
nomadic-hunters living along the margins between the tall-grass prairie and woodlands in
the region that became western Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>The migration of these groups onto the Plains was not simultaneous, but instead,
occurred over a period beginning roughly 1650 and extending to nearly 1800. Movements
originated due to crowding of cultures from their traditional homelands by a "domino-effect"
following the arrival of Europeans along the Atlantic coast and colonial expansion westward.
The routes and means of the Native transformations varied. When pushed westward, some
groups, like the ancestors of the Arapaho and Crow immediately migrated to the Plains,
quickly adopting the successful pedestrian-nomad lifestyles and technologies of the bison
hunting Athapaskans. Other groups, such as the Cherokee and Yankton Sioux, encountered
the villages of the Mandan along the Missouri River and, for a brief time, settled nearby,
adopting the Plains earthlodges and the stream side horticultural practices of established
Plains horticulturalists (Berthrong 1984; DeMallie 1984; Gunnerson and Bouc 1984).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>Sometime shortly after 1750, the horse trade reached the northern Plains and horses
quickly became part of the lives of those pedestrian-nomads. Some tribes, such as the
Cherokee, did not migrate to the Plains until after their acquisition of the horse. By 1775,
Sioux groups began moving across the Missouri River and onto the shortgrass Prairie and
High Plains, coming in contact with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, forming alliances with those
groups, and waging wars with others. It was these groups of late Plains arrivals that
flourished into the stereotypic feathered Plains horse mounted nomad.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>Numerous Algonkian and Siouan groups were displaced westward during the 18<SUP>th</SUP> and
19<SUP>th</SUP> centuries. The late prehistory and early history of eastern Nebraska was heavily impacted
by the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota Sioux tribes. These groups did not reside in eastern
Nebraska, but they dramatically influenced the lives of the Natives who did reside here
(Berthrong 1984; DeMallie 1984; Gunnerson and Bouc 1984). The newfound wealth in
horses, tradegoods and guns, allowed these Equestrian nomads to rapidly grow in number.
Like all American Natives, they suffered losses to European diseases, but unlike the village
people, they did not loose large numbers of their population. Combined, the Arapaho and
Cheyenne numbered more than 7,500 in 1805, and by the mid-1800's the Lakota probably
numbered nearly 20,000 (Parks et. al 1980:291-4), forming the largest and most powerful
force on the Plains.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>These three nomadic tribes actively engaged in the fur trade, and with the horse and
gun, they killed enough bison to begin creating shortages in some regions. As an allied force,
they were able to displace other tribes and rigorously defend their newly gained bison
hunting grounds from outsiders, including the Pawnee, Ponca, Omaha, and Oto from eastern
Nebraska who depended heavily on the bison herds for subsistence. In addition to their
competition for bison hunting territory, the nomadic tribes frequently raided eastward,
plundering the villages for horses, corn, and women, or for the glory and honor.<U></U></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>Wagons Westward</U>:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>With the settlement of Oregon, and later California, the Great Plains became simply
a place to be crossed on the way west. Abandoning the northern Missouri River route of
Lewis and Clark, other trails were charted across the central Plains, most of them winding
across southeastern Nebraska from the trailheads along the Missouri River and converging
at Fort Kearny. The first wagons to leave their tracks on what was to become the Oregon
Trail, were those taken west by Jedediah Smith, David Jackson, and William Sublette in
1830 (Hulbert 1930:20-22). In 1843, the migrations to Oregon began in earnest with more
than 1000 people traveling westward. Brigham Young and his followers set out to establish
a "New Zion," by way of the Mormon Trail in 1847. Driven by hunger for land, adventure,
or religious freedom, thousands had used the trails to emigrate through what is now
Nebraska, then in 1848, gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill in California. Reliable statistics
are not available, although most estimates place the number of westward-bound emigrants
at 40,000 in 1849, increasing to 55,000 in 1850, the numbers held steady until 1853 when
the Nation's gold fever diminished. The migrations along these trails continued until the
establishment of the transcontinental railroad, although not at the fevered-pace of the early
1850's (Norton et al. 1984).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Although thousands had traveled the trails ahead of them, many of the "Forty-Niners"
were unprepared for the trip. Many started west with their wagon preposterously overloaded;
other tried to walk, carrying their worldly possessions on their backs. Only a few miles west
of the Missouri River, they became aware of their mistakes, and the trail became strewn with
abandoned equipment and baggage. Some sold, traded, or burned their excess, a few
unhooked the teams of horses, and rode away, leaving fully loaded wagons (DeWolf 1925).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Illness was a constant threat to the wagon trains and numerous pioneer graves can be
found along the trails. One traveler wrote: "<EM>It is supposed that one-fifth are dying here now
with cholera and diarrhoeas </EM>(sic)…" (Wood 1871:31). Another wrote: "<EM>In respect</EM> <EM>I had
intended to notice in my journal every grave… but have abandoned this part… Graves are so
numerous that to notice them all would make my narrative tedious</EM>" (Langworthy in Phillips
1932:37-38).</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U></U></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT><U>Euroamerican Settlement on the Plains</U>:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>With the eastern United States already settled, and ever increasing streams of
emigrants heading west, the concept of a permanent Indian frontier west of the Mississippi
was abandoned. In 1841 the passage of the Pre-emption Act enabled settlers to buy up to 160
acres of land in organized territories from the Federal Government for one-dollar-and-a-quarter an acre after they had cultivated it for one year. With the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which created the Nebraska Territory and opened the region to
settlement, Euroamerican settlers began pouring into the new Territory. This hunger for land
to feed a rapidly growing nation forced the United States Congress to devise an official
policy for handling the "Indian problem." Reservations were created to board the Indian
population and the military began coercing tribes to sign treaties relinquishing their
traditional lands. The eastern Plains tribes, weakened by disease and conflict, presented little
resistance. Once on reservations, Indian agents, teachers and missionaries flocked to the
reservations to "save," educate, and assimilate the Natives into the White culture.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 made land ownership more easily available,
resulting in a flood of immigration by Euroamericans and some free-Blacks into the territory,
further increasing the urgency for the government to deal with the Native populations. At the
end of the Civil War, in 1865, the efforts of the military were concentrated against the Plains
Indians. The large, powerful western Plains Equestrian Nomad tribes continued to resist
being place on reservations, and once confined to reservations, even the eastern Plains groups
continued annual bison hunts. In an effort to destroy the primary resource base of the
Nomads, and the reason for other tribes to leave their reservations, the United States
Government expanded the policy of bison herd extermination (Norton et al. 1984; Oswalt
and Neely 1996). These Indian Wars campaigns lasted into the 1890's when the last of the
Indian tribes succumbed to the U.S. military pressure and the government's reservation
policy.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	Because of its geographic, environmental, and social situation, the Great Plains, more than
any other culture area, underwent radical transformations throughout prehistory. Prehistoric
trade routes and migration brought Plains people, either directly or indirectly, into contact
with people, technologies, customs, and ideas from outside the Plains physiographic region.
For 12,000 years, and possibly longer, the Plains were the home to an evolving series of
vibrant aboriginal cultures. In the end, decimated by European diseases, starving because of
the lack of bison, defeated by the U.S. Army, and displaced by Euroamerican settlers, the
Native populations were eventually confined to reservations. At that time, care of the wide-open and fertile Great Plains was taken over by Euroamerican immigrants.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 opened the region to settlement and
Euroamericans began pouring into the new Nebraska Territory. Merely two years after the
territory was opened, the first Euroamericans took up permanent residence in the Salt Creek
Valley and its tributaries, including the Stevens Creek Valley.</P>

<P><U></U>	Many accounts are written regarding the interactions between these early settlers and the
Indians who remained in eastern Nebraska at that time. The accuracy of some stories is open
to dispute and many early authors clearly embellished the actual events. Regardless of the
memories and imaginings of these early settlers, the Hollywood scenario of the "Wild West"
with a band of "savage" painted Indians circling a ring of covered wagons and a timely
rescue by heroic blue-clad Cavalry troops was never played out in the eastern Plains.</P>

<P>	After the Louisiana Purchase in 1804, explorers, traders, and trappers were regulars on
the Plains, but their numbers were relatively small. Because Indian groups welcomed the
tradegoods brought by these newcomers (Dorsey 1882; Holder 1967; Parks 1992), their
presence, at that time, was not significant enough to provoke serious Indian resistance. Along
with the tradegoods, though, came European diseases to which the Indians had no natural
tolerance, resulting in tragic, profound depopulation. Hardest impacted were eastern Plains
village cultures like the Omaha, Oto and Pawnee (Parks, et al. 1980). At the same time, these
village tribes were under constant pressure from their old enemies, the Arapaho and
Cheyenne, and the powerful, relatively new arrivals, the Lakota Sioux. These once
formidable village tribes residing in the eastern Plains, now allied with the Whites to insure
their own survival (Dunlay 1984). Fort Atkinson, established north of present-day Omaha
in 1819, was abandoned in 1827 because the frontier of Indian conflict had moved farther
west. By June of 1856, when John D. Prey and his son John W. took residence along Salt
Creek, one-half mile south of what would become 25<SUP>th</SUP> and Roca Road, all large-scale
conflicts and military campaigns against the Indians were waged, primarily, with the
nomadic equestrian tribes west of Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. Although Indians still
lived in Lancaster County at that time, few Indian related incidents involving bloodshed
occurred and when they did, the Indians were usually the ones to die.</P>

<P>	In 1857, a man named John Davis, residing near the village of Saltillo, "<EM>...had a great
desire to add to his experiences that of killing an Indian</EM>" (Hayes and Cox 1889:69).<EM> </EM>"<EM>He
made his brags that he would..., and one day, very uncalled for, he fulfilled this desire by
killing a Pawnee that wandered onto his property.</EM>" (Sawyer 1916:339). The consequences
were not what he anticipated. At that time, there were a number of Pawnee, Oto, and Omaha
in the vicinity. Upon hearing of the death of one of theirs, they "<EM>...went on the war path
</EM>(Hayes and Cox 1889:69). The settlers, fearing for their lives, escaped eastward, gathering
together at the larger settlement of Weeping Water. A company of about 100 volunteers was
formed in Nebraska City to quell the "uprising." They captured one Indian, but the men
assigned to stand guard let him step out for fresh air, and he escaped. After two weeks,
residents returned home, many finding their homes raided, or burned, although no settler's
lives were lost (Hayes and Cox 1889; Sawyer 1916).</P>

<P>	In early 1859, several Pawnee stole the carcass of a freshly killed deer from the home of
Jeremiah Garrett a few miles south of present-day Lincoln. Garrett, and neighbors, Solomon
Kirk, and William Arnold set out to punish the Indians. After about three miles, they caught
with the thieves in the act of skinning the deer, and fired on them. Arnold wounded one of
them, and Garrett killed one, but was wounded by an arrow before the Indians fled. A few
hours later, the cabin of James Bogus was found looted of clothing and food. A group of
volunteers gathered at the home of a settler, Mr. Sophir, along Salt Creek west of the present
site of the penitentiary. The next morning, one of the settlers, Joel Mason, attempted to talk
with the Indians who were camped within site of the Sophir cabin. The Indians were
uncooperative and threatening, though, and forced him back to Sophir's cabin, where the
settlers opened fire, killing three Pawnee and wounding five others (Hayes and Cox 1889).</P>

<P>	Later that year, during the summer of 1859, several bands of Cheyenne and Arapaho came
east to the Salt Creek basin to gather salt. During their visit, some band members, apparently
young braves intent on making a name for themselves, roamed the area causing mischief.
They appeared at the home of John W. Prey and abducted his daughter, 13 year old Rebbeca.
Mrs. Prey followed the Indians while her 16 year old son, David, summoned help. David,
his father, and several of the Preys' neighbors caught up with the Indians within a few miles,
and convinced them to release the girl unharmed. Several days later, the Indian bands moved
northward toward the Platte River, leaving nervous, but unharmed settlers behind (Hayes and
Cox 1889).</P>

<P>	Some insight into the makeup of the Indian population, and the size of the Native groups
still living in the County can be made based on the account of John S. Gregory. In September
of 1862, Gregory arrived at the salt basin, near present-day Lincoln, where he observed
"<EM>...about a mile west on Middle Creek, the smoke was rising from a camp of Oto Indians.</EM>"
He spent his first night in the area <EM>"...down in the bend of Oak Creek, where West Lincoln
now stands, </EM>[at]<EM> a camp of about 100 Pawnee wigwams</EM>" (quoted in Hayes and Cox 1889:78-79).</P>

<P>	News of the 1862 Santee Rebellion in Minnesota caused some concern to the
Euroamerican residents of eastern Nebraska, although it appears that word did not reach
Lancaster County until the rebellion had been thoroughly crushed by the U.S. Army (Sawyer
1916). Little else occurred until 1864 when the Sioux appeared to the west, in the valley of
the Big Blue River. Most terrified residents of Lancaster County fled eastward to Weeping
Water or Nebraska City. A group of eight brave men, though, proceeded west to gather
information. They saw no Indians until they reached the Big Blue River, when they noticed
a single warrior watching them from some distance. The settlers decided to retreat, but the
Indian made a signal and "<EM>...suddenly there rose up from the low grounds, several hundred
mounted Indians, right across their pathway. The</EM> [warriors]<EM> began to bear down on the little
company of whites to hem them in</EM>" (Hayes and Cox 1889:71). The settlers drew their
weapons, intent on putting up a good fight, in spite of the overwhelming odds. To the relief
of the "army" of settlers, it was not the Sioux, but a party of Pawnee, allied with the U.S.
Government, out hunting their traditional Sioux enemies. Thinking all the settlers had left
the region, the Pawnee attacked, hoping they had caught a small band of Sioux, separated
from their kin. When the Pawnee got close enough to realize their mistake, they halted the
attack and raised a white flag in time to prevent bloodshed on either side. The Pawnee
explained their actions and moved on, in search of the Sioux. The Salt Valley volunteers,
apparently having seen enough Indians for a while, quickly headed back east, toward their
homes (Sawyer 1916:19).</P>

<P>	Indians frequently stayed overnight at the Retzlaff Stock Farm, east of present-day
Lincoln. Mrs. Retzlaff "<EM>…made coffee and cornbread for them, and after they had eaten, they
would sit on the ground and smoke their peace pipe</EM>" (quoted in The State Journal, Sunday
June 10, 1917). Writing in 1907, Charles Retzlaff states: "<EM>Indians were plenty in those days,
but all were friendly. The only thing I ever knew of their doing was to kill a neighbor's cow
or two, which they cut to pieces and carried away. We had one Indian scare... in 1864 it was
reported that the Indians were going to drive all the whites from Nebraska. Many of the
settlers left their homes and went to Nebraska City. I loaded my rifle, a single shot affair,
after which I felt secure from the thousands of Redskins, remained on my claim and never
saw a single Indian</EM>" (quoted in Sawyer 1916:341).</P>

<P>	Most occurrences of settler and Indian conflict, was the result of theft of property, or
incidents that some settlers felt was extortion. Clearly many of the disputes resulted from
cultural differences concerning differing customs of sharing resources and contrasts in
perceptions of private property ownership. These differences were, most assuredly,
heightened by each group's preconceived ideas about the other. Tragically, some incidents
resulted from small bands of destitute Indians resorting to any means to survive. While the
Indians were a source of constant suspicion and uneasiness to the early settlers, most settlers
simply resigned themselves to live with the occasional loss of a cow or other property. With
the end of the Civil War in 1865, the effort of the U.S. military was concentrated against the
Plains Indians, pushing the frontier of conflict farther west, and virtually ending all contact
between the Natives and the Lancaster County settlers (Sawyer 1916).</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>5. <U>PROJECT Design and Survey Methods</U></STRONG></P>

<P>	The Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office (NeSHPO) determined the design of this
pedestrian cultural resource survey. They recommended complete (100%) coverage of all
stream-crossings from valley margin-to-margin, and a ten-percent coverage sample survey
of the uplands. Olsson Environmental Sciences, in communication with the NeSHPO,
contracted with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) for a one-quarter mile (400 m)
wide survey corridor along a single proposed east-west southern corridor (SM-4); three
proposed north-south corridor alternatives (EC-1, EM-1, EF-1); and five alternate connecting
diagonals. All survey corridors were centered along the entire length of the proposed
roadways. In addition, complete (100%) survey coverage was required on one-half mile (800
m) diameter areas surrounding major intersection alternatives. These intersections included
a single connector of SM-4 with U.S. Highway 77; three interchanges where alternate
diagonals intersect Nebraska Highway 2; three intersection alternates along U.S. Highway
34 (east O Street); and three alternates to connect to Interstate 80. Maps and aerial
photographs of the South and East Beltway (SEB) Study Area showing the locations of the
proposed road alignments were supplied to UNL by Olsson Environmental Sciences.</P>

<P>	Project oversight for the archeological investigations were provided by Mr. Rob Bozell
of the Nebraska State Historical Society-Highway Archeology Program through an
agreement with the Nebraska Department of Roads.</P>

<P>	Landscape data and topographic settings for the project area were gleaned from USGS
7.5-minute topographic maps and air-photos to identify areas of uplands and extents of
stream-crossings. The aerial photos also provided a means of identifying major landmarks
and features to better determine the proper location of roadway alignments while in the field.
Prior to initiating the pedestrian survey, Parks and Stupka-Burda conducted reconnaissance
of the project area to field check and refine these landform data.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U></U><U>Native American Contacts</U>:</P>

<P>The UNL Department of Anthropology supplied details of the SEB cultural resource
survey to the Nebraska State Indian Commission by letter. This letter detailed awareness that
sites held sacred by Native Americans could exist within the region. We requested guidance
in determining a course of action that would insure such sites are appropriately recognized
and protected if determined to exist within the SEB study area boundaries. </P>

<P>Upon the recommendation of the Nebraska State Indian Commission, the Department
of Anthropology sent letters to ten Native American Tribes describing the SEB study, and
reiterating a commitment toward protecting sacred sites should they exist within the SEB
study area. These tribes include, the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, the Santee Tribe, the Omaha
Tribe, the Winnebago tribe, the Southern Ponca Tribe, the Pawnee Tribe, the Iowa Tribe of
Nebraska and Iowa, the Otoe-Missouri Tribe, the Lakota Tribe, and the Three Affiliated
Tribes (Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara). Currently, no information that may affect this project has
been returned.</P>

<P><U>Local Interest Group Contacts</U>:</P>

<P>	Informational letters were also sent to representatives of local neighborhood interest
groups. The letters explained the purpose of this cultural resource survey and asked for group
support in fulfilling this compliance inventory. The UNL researchers also asked for
assistance in identifying individual sites, locations, or districts that may be of special
concern. No responses to these informational letters were received.<U></U></P>

<P><U>Field Inventory Methods</U>:</P>

<P>	The archeological research methods and field techniques employed by UNL during this
Cultural Resource Inventory met all guidelines set forth in the <U>Nebraska State Historic
Preservation Office Guidelines for Protection of Archeological Properties</U> (NSHS 1989); the
<U>U.S. Department of the Interior Archeology and Historic Preservation Standards and
Guidelines</U> (USDI 1983); as well as the highest professional ethics and standards.</P>

<P>The Principle Investigators were assisted in the pedestrian cultural resource survey
by numerous experienced, paid crew-persons from the UNL Department of Anthropology.
Parks and/or Stupka-Burda were present during all phases of field survey, and were solely
responsible for identifying the location and alignment of the corridor centerline and location
of intersections centers, and for determining survey corridor width and intersection radiuses.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	While conducting stream-crossing survey, where total coverage was called for, pedestrian
survey transects were spaced at not-greater-than 30 meter intervals. In survey units, or
portions of units where surface visibility was significantly diminished, transect spacing was
reduced to compensate for this decrease in visibility. Additionally, more intensive survey
was conducted on alluvial fans and/or terraces, settings in which past experience has shown
higher statistical tendencies for site location. The surface visibility of all surveyed acreage
was minimally ten-percent. Visibility was greater, averaging 30-to-50-percent throughout
the vast majority of surveyed acreage, nearing 80-to-90-percent in a limited number of
survey units.</P>

<P>In the survey of uplands, where a ten-percent sampling of acreage was conducted,
transect locations were based on landowner permission, surface visibility, and archival or
informant information. An attempt was made to evenly spread the ten-percent sampling of
acreage along all portions of upland. Survey of some portions of upland far exceeded the ten-percent required because archival research suggested a higher than average potential for
locating trails/and or other historic features within that vicinity. These increased percentages
of surveyed upland acres in other areas more than accounted for the failure to gain access to
other uplands, and the sample survey of ten-percent of the uplands was met, or exceeded.</P>

<P><U>Modern Agriculture and Effects on Cultural Resources:</U></P>

<P>Much of the survey corridor currently exists as cultivated fields. While cultivation
can offer researchers increased ground surface visibility, it also affects the integrity of
archeological sites. Cultivation destroys any artifactual association previously contained
within the plowzone. In addition, cultivation also spreads artifact scatters beyond their
original point of deposition, thereby expanding the extent of surface manifestation.</P>

<P><U>Observed Cultural Resources</U>:</P>

<P>	When cultural materials were observed, transect spacing was reduced and the surrounding
area intensively investigated. All observed artifacts were pin-flagged to determine the artifact
density and surface spatial extent of each site. Researchers employed a non-collection
strategy, and unless otherwise noted, artifacts were not collected. </P>

<P>UNL field designations were assigned to each site. The field designations along the
southern corridor began with "SOAP" (an acronym for the <U>SO</U>uthern <U>A</U>rcheological <U>P</U>roject),
included "97" (a project year indicator), and each cultural manifestation received a sequential
number. Field designations on the eastern corridors began with EBAP (acronym for Eastern
Beltway Archeological Project), included "98", and a sequential number. Hence, the first site
recorded during the inventory project along the southern route was "SOAP97-1". The first
site along the eastern corridors was "EBAP98-1".</P>

<P>	After a site was thoroughly surveyed, the assemblage assessed, and the extent and density
of artifacts determined, field notations and sketch maps were made, and multiple
photographs taken. Some UNL field designations were assigned to locations that were
determined to not warrant formal Nebraska State archeological site numbers. NSHS
Archeological Site Forms were completed for each of the forty-seven previously unrecorded
sites found in the survey.</P>

<P>	Following the completion of the intensive pedestrian survey of the ¼ mile (400 m) wide
Beltway corridor options, controlled subsurface testing was conducted on 17 selected sites
with potential for additional subsurface cultural materials.  These sites were in consultation
with NeSHPO.  Testing was conducted to provide additional data for descriptions,
evaluations, and recommendations regarding these newly recorded cultural resources. Such
limited subsurface testing is intended to indicate whether intact, undisturbed cultural deposits
are present, and to determine if additional, perhaps multiple, occupational levels not
represented by surface manifestations, are present beneath known site locations. Ultimately,
the evaluation of these subsurface test data are intended to provide a reasonable basis for
determining if additional, more intensive subsurface testing, or mitigative action would be
warranted prior to road construction or related impacts.</P>

<P><U>Test Site Selection</U>:</P>

<P>As agreed upon in the Scope of Work (Olsson Environmental Sciences 1998), Rob
Bozell, Associate Director for Archeology, Nebraska State Historical Society, was consulted
by UNL researchers during selection of sites to be tested. Bozell (personal communication
September 1998) concurred that systematic subsurface investigations were advisable at 18
sites. No formalized set of criteria was used to determine which sites were tested. Instead,
test site selection was based on several, seemingly quite subjective, but commonly employed
archeological standards. Typically, two or more of the following criteria must be met for a
site to warrant consideration for testing. These criteria include:</P>

<P>1) Presence of multiple surface artifacts and/or the presence of surface
features, such as depressions.</P>

<P>2) Also heavily considered, was the geologic landform on which the site is
located. </P>

<P>3) 	The presence of patterned tools.</P>

<P>4) 	The presence of multiple artifact classes, such as lithic and pottery
and/or fire-cracked rock .</P>

<P>5) 	Relative proximity to current, or past water resources.</P>

<P>6) 	Information supplied by landowners/tenants regarding amateur
collecting of cultural materials.</P>

<P>Once test sites were selected, a standardized program of procedures was implemented
to obtain comparable data from tested sites. In general, the purpose of the program was to
assess the natural, subsurface, geomorphological characteristics at site locations, to assess
the integrity of cultural materials at each site, and, at some sites, to achieve limited site-specific objectives, such as identifying and assessing features evident at surface levels.</P>

<P>In view of these objectives, an important consideration in the testing program
development, was selection of shovel test transects and intervals, as well as formal test unit
locations, to maximize information concerning both vertical and horizontal site
characteristics. Limited field time and the absence, at most sites, of observable surface
features, or extensive surface materials, were factors that made it desirable to conduct
subsurface testing, using a restricted number of quite widely dispersed test locations within
each site area. </P>

<P><U>NRHP Evaluation Criteria for Archeology:</U></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	There are four criteria used to evaluate properties for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1981).
These criteria require that the sites:</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></FONT>	A)  are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad 
      </P>

<P><U></U>	     broad patterns of our history; or</P>

<P>	B)  are associated with the lives and persons significant in our past; or</P>

<P>	C)  embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of </P>

<P>                  construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high </P>

<P>                  artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity </P>

<P>	       whose components may lack individual distincition; or</P>

<P>	D)   have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory                         </P>

<P>                   or history.</P>

<P>(Preservation Law 1995:SecII:60.4).</P>

<P>Archeological sites are most commonly nominated for inclusion to the National
Register under Criterion D, which includes properties that have the potential to contain
information that answers important research questions about human prehistory or history
which could not otherwise be addressed. Archeologically, Criterion D has two requirements,
which must <U>both</U> be met for a property to qualify for the NRHP:</P>

<P>1) 	The property must have, or have had, information to contribute to our
understanding of human history or prehistory, and</P>

<P>2) 	That information must be considered important.</P>

<P>(Preservation Law 1995:SecIII:Bulletin 15:D).</P>

<P>	Once these two basic Criterion D requirements are met, other guidelines determine
the information potential requirements applicable to archeological sites:</P>

<P>1) 	The property must have sufficient physical integrity to contain intact data
that is retrievable if the appropriate study techniques are employed; and</P>

<P>2) 	The property must contain information which contributes directly to our
understanding of human history or prehistory; or</P>

<P>3) 	The property must contain information to test a hypothesis or hypotheses
about events, groups, or processes in the past that bear on important
research questions about history or prehistory; or</P>

<P>4) 	The information must corroborate, confirm, refute, and/or supplement in
an important way currently available information, or</P>

<P>5) 	The property must make it possible to reconstruct the sequence of
archeological cultures for the purpose of identifying and explaining
continuities and discontinuities in the archeological record.</P>

<P>(Preservation Law 1995:SecIII:Bulletin 15:D).</P>

<P>	The archeological sites recorded during the pedestrian survey conducted in
association with the South and East Beltway Major Investment Study were preliminarily
considered for nomination under all criteria described above, but particularly with regard to
Criterion D.<U></U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Evaluation of Archeological Resources Located:</U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Temporally diagnostic artifacts collected from the ground surface in the vicinity of
the SEB Study Area during previous archeological investigations suggest that humans were
present in the region as early as 8,000 years ago (Wood 1998). For a variety of reasons
though, the prehistory of the area has not been well documented and is generally poorly
understood. Therefore, almost every prehistoric site in the area could contribute, to some
degree, to our knowledge of the region. Not every site, however, will meet the minimum
standards for nomination to the NRHP.</P>

<P>	Much of the modern ground surface in the SEB Study Area has been impacted to
some degree by modern human activity, including agriculture, construction, road building,
and flood control activities, as well as natural factors such as flooding and erosion. These
impacts have affected to varying degrees the integrity of the archeological materials located
within the SM-4, EC-1, EM-1, and EF-1 survey areas. <U></U></P>

<P><U>Research Methods Conclusion</U>:</P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The field methods employed during this project met all professional standards and
guidelines. It should be noted that several factors were inherent in the project design and
research methods that, if unaccounted for, would bias any statistical analysis or probability
statements based solely on the data collected during this survey. Surveyed acreage was
confined to a selected corridor along a proposed transportation right-of-way, and within
intersections of that corridor and existing roads. The selection of acreage for the ten-percent
upland sample within the corridor was dependent upon surface visibility and landowner
permission. These factors resulted in surveyed acreage that was not random. Consequently,
the data from this inventory project should not be employed statistically to calculate
probabilities regarding cultural resources for any given topographic setting within the Salt
Creek or Stevens Creek watersheds.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>6. <U>DESCRIPTION OF observed CULTURAL RESOURCES</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<P>	In November and December of 1997, six previously unidentified cultural
sites, 25LC93; 25LC94; 25LC95; 25LC96 and 25LC97; SOAP97-2, were recorded through
intensive inventory of the one-quarter mile wide (400 m) corridor along the SM-4 route. The
sites are summarized in Table 2. In May - July of 1998, 41 previously unrecorded cultural
sites, 25LC112-to-25LC148, EBAP98-38, EBAP98-39, EBAP98-40 and EBAP98-41
(Nebraska State trinomials for the four EBAP numbers are forthcoming) were recorded
through intensive inventory of the one-quarter mile wide (400 m) corridor along the EC-1,
EM-1 and EF-1 alternatives. These sites are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.  Each site
identified during both stages of the SEB Corridor Cultural Resources Survey is described
further below, beginning with sites located along the SM-4 route.<U></U></P>

<P>	SOAP97-1 was assigned to a cultural resource site that is located outside of the SM-4
corridor. That site was discovered as survey crews crossed a field to reach the SM-4 corridor.
The acreage surveyed to determine the nature and extent of that site is not included in
acreage covered for this project.</P>

<P>	If archeological sites were located, property owners were notified by letter.  If site
testing was necessary affected property owners were contacted again by phone.</P>

<P>	These investigations employed a non-collection strategy, therefore, artifacts were
generally not collected.  Any artifacts collected remain the property of the landowner and
will be returned upon request.  If artifacts were collected, affected property owners will be
contacted upon completion of these investigations.</P>

<P><STRONG>25LC93 (SOAP97-3):</STRONG></P>

<P>             This site is a prehistoric lithic scatter and covers approximately 4000 m<SUP>2</SUP>. In
December of 1997, the vegetation at this site was harvested milo, providing a ground surface
visibility of approximately 70-percent.</P>

<P>	Initially, a diffuse quartzite and chert flakes and shatter were noted on the ground
surface. Additional, intensive survey of the location was conducted, revealing the presence
of fire-cracked rock. No temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were observed.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC93 has been plowed, impacting the integrity of archeological content
contained within the plow-zone. In addition, the field where this site was located has been
conservation terraced. The artifacts were observed approximately 10 m downslope from a
terrace band. No terracing had been done downslope from the lithic scatter. </P>

<P><U>25LC93 Evaluation and Recommendation:</U></P>

<P>	The lithic scatter is located within the proposed SM-4 corridor and if construction
proceeds as planned, this site could be impacted or destroyed.</P>

<P>	This location was intensively surveyed and no temporally or functionally diagnostic
artifacts were observed. In addition, conservation terracing, and years of plowing have
modified the slope where the scatter is located. There is little chance for intact subsurface
cultural deposits with a potential for yielding significant cultural data that can contribute to
archeological research of the region.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC93 is not considered eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Additional
archeological investigation or conservation at this site is not necessary. Avoidance of the site
during construction along the SM-4 roadway is not required.</P>

<P><STRONG>25LC94 (SOAP97-4):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site is the remnants of a Euroamerican farmstead and is estimated to cover 600
m<SUP>2</SUP>. In 1997, vegetation on site consisted of patchy, un-mowed grasses, woody scrub thicket,
and trees, limiting ground surface visibility to approximately 10 percent.</P>

<P>	A shallow foundation depression feature, approximately 9 m in diameter by 1 m
deep, containing foundation rubble was located near the south edge of a scatter of historic
artifacts. Remnants of a possible sidewalk and fencing were also observed. Surface artifacts
included various types of sun-altered and colored bottleglass, flatglass, ferrous wire nails,
pressed common red brick, and limestone foundation rubble with lime mortar. Modern litter,
including beer and soda bottles and cans, snack food containers, and plastic sacks are also
present around several recent "campfire" features.</P>

<P>	The site area was possibly impacted by construction of nearby roadways. The artifact
assemblage has also been heavily, negatively impacted by recent human activity at the site.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U></U><U>25LC94 Evaluation and Recommendation:</U></P>

<P>	The historic farmstead site is located within the SM-4 corridor, near a potential
diagonal. If construction along that route proceeds, it is probable that some impact to the site
will occur.</P>

<P>	The cultural resources at 25LC94 are limited and the information already collected
is adequate to address issues of human land-use and historic settlement patterns. While it is
possible that this site preserves intact subsurface features, additional archeological
investigation of these features is unlikely to yield new information that could contribute
significantly to research questions regarding historic lifeways of the region.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC94 is recommended not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Additional
archeological investigation or conservation at this site is not necessary. Avoidance or
protection of the site during construction along the proposed SM-4 roadway is not required. </P>

<P><STRONG>25LC95 (SOAP97-5):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site is a Euroamerican farmstead and associated features covering approximately
2,500 m<SUP>2</SUP>. In 1997, vegetation on site consisted of mowed, mixed grasses permitting a ground
surface visibility of about 30 percent.</P>

<P>	This early Lancaster County homestead was registered in 1884. The father of the
current landowner purchased the property in 1908. The foundation outline of the original
house structure is clearly evident. The concrete back steps and a hand-dug, brick and
limestone lined well are still present. A cistern and several privy depressions were also noted.
Historic artifacts present on the ground surface include household items, farming
implements, whiteware sherds, various glass fragments, and cut nails. Additionally, the
current landowner indicated that some archival material regarding this homestead is in the
family's possession and is available if needed by researchers.</P>

<P>	The archeological integrity of this historic house site appears to be well intact. </P>

<P><U>25LC95 Evaluation and Recommendation</U>:</P>

<P>	The historic farmstead site, 25LC95, preserves a number of subsurface archeological
features and quite possibly, an extensive artifact assemblage dating back as early as the
1880's. The site is located within the proposed SM-4 corridor and will undoubtedly be
heavily impacted, or destroyed if construction proceeds along that route.</P>

<P>	The locational information already collected at 25LC95 is adequate to address issues
of human land-use and historic settlement patterns. Additional archeological investigation
is unlikely to yield information regarding local or regional history that is not already
available in an archival format. These factors, combined with the absence of significant
events or people associated with this site limit the research potential of 25LC95. While this
site meets the basic age requirement for eligibility, as detailed above, it currently fails to
meet the additional criteria necessary to recommend its protection.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC95 should not be considered for nomination to the NRHP. Additional
archeological investigation of this site is not recommended. Avoidance or protection of
25LC95 during construction along the proposed roadway is not required.</P>

<P><STRONG>25LC96 (SOAP 97-6):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site consists of cinder scatter located in an upland region. The scatter is
estimated to cover about 400 m<SUP>2</SUP>. In December of 1997, vegetation at this site consisted of
plowed corn, and ground surface visibility was estimated at 70 percent.</P>

<P>	The only artifacts observed at 25LC96 were cinders, waste left from burning coal.
The site is most likely a location where late-19<SUP>th</SUP> or early-20<SUP>th</SUP> century steam-powered
threshing activities were conducted. Threshing was typically done on upland areas where
stronger and more constant winds assisted in separating the grain from the chaff.</P>

<P><U>25LC96 Recommendation and Evaluation:</U></P>

<P>	This cinder scatter is the surface manifestation of activities associated with early
modern agriculture and is representative of brief occupations well documented archivally.
Although this scatter will be destroyed if construction of the westernmost alternate diagonal
proceeds, locational information already collected, is adequate to address studies of historic
human land-use patterns.</P>

<P>	This site is not recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Additional
archeological investigation will yield no additional information and is not recommended.
Avoidance of 25LC96 during construction along the proposed roadway is not required.</P>

<P><STRONG>25LC97 (SOAP97-7):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site also consists of cinder scatter located in an upland region and covers roughly
200 m<SUP>2</SUP>. During December of 1997, vegetation at the site consisted of reduced-tillage plowed
corn, and ground surface visibility was estimated at approximately 70 percent.</P>

<P>	At 25LC97, several small sherds of whiteware and bottleglass were observed in
addition to cinders. This site most likely represents a location where late-19<SUP>th</SUP> or early-20<SUP>th</SUP>
century steam-powered threshing activities were conducted.</P>

<P><U>25LC97 Recommendation and Evaluation:</U></P>

<P>	This cinder scatter is the surface manifestation of activities associated with early
modern agriculture and is representative of brief occupations well documented archivally.
Although this scatter will be destroyed if construction of the westernmost alternate diagonal
proceeds, locational information already collected, is adequate to address studies of historic
human land-use patterns.</P>

<P>	This site is not recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Additional
archeological investigation will yield no additional information and is not recommended.
Avoidance of 25LC97 during construction along the proposed roadway is not required.</P>

<P><STRONG>SOAP97-2:</STRONG></P>

<P>	This field designation refers to a depression located in an unplowed wooded area near
an intermittent stream adjacent to Salt Creek. Large, relatively old bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa) trees surround the area of the depression feature suggesting this locale may
never have been plowed. Surface ground-cover vegetation of this area was sparse, but the
ground surface was littered with fallen leaves. Ground surface visibility was approximately
10-percent.</P>

<P>	The depression is roughly circular in shape and is approximately 5 m in diameter.
Near the center, it is about 1 m deep. No associated artifacts were observed on the ground
surface, however, there is alluvial deposition estimated to be as recent as 1993.</P>

<P>	Site testing included additional intensive surface survey of the area surrounding the
depression, and production of a sketch site-map. Systematic subsurface testing consisted of
a series of equally spaced shovel tests excavated at right angle across the depression,
extending to 5 m (16 ft) outside of the depression. The shovel tests were approximately 30
cm in diameter by 50 cm deep. In addition, a 1 m x 1 m test unit was excavated at the margin
of the depression to allow inspection of the stratigraphic profile. The test unit was excavated
to 75 cm in depth. The soil from the shovel tests and excavation unit was screened through
¼ inch quad screen.</P>

<P>	The results of the archeological testing at SOAP97-2 were negative. No cultural
materials were observed on the surface during the additional intensive survey, and none were
encountered in either the shovel tests or test excavation unit. The inorganic soil matrix
proved to be a rather uniform sandy loam with no clear distinction in stratigraphy. The
surface is covered with 10-to-15 cm (4-6 in) of wholly organic leaf litter. The soil matrix also
contains a very high organic content. As could be expected, the degree of organic
decomposition increased with depth.</P>

<P><U>SOAP97-2 Evaluation and Recommendation</U>:</P>

<P>	The origin of the depression at SOAP97-2 was not determined with complete
certainty. It does not appear to be a natural geologic feature, but rather, appears to be cultural
in nature. The lack of artifacts on either the present surface, or in the excavations, though,
suggests that it is not a significant cultural feature. The best explanation is that the feature
represents the remnant of a small borrow pit where soil was removed for use elsewhere. </P>

<P>	As a cultural feature, the research potential of SOAP97-2 is non-existent. Additional
archeological investigation of this feature will not yield information that will contribute to
meaningful research questions regarding historic lifeways of the region. </P>

<P>	 Site SOAP97-2 is recommended not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Additional archeological investigations of this feature are not recommended. Avoidance,
protection, or other conservation measures during, or following construction of the proposed
roadway is not required.</P>

<P><STRONG>25LC112 (EBAP98-1):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site is a lithic scatter located in an area of glacial till. In 1998, this field was
cultivated in corn, providing greater than 80 percent surface visibility at the time of survey.</P>

<P>	The till outcrop has a locally typical makeup of granite, quartzite, chert, and basalt
cobbles. The presence of this glacial till complicated surface survey of this location and
required intensive inspection of a larger amount of surface materials. Many cobbles reveal
plow/disc scars, and some portion of the broken cobbles observed are undoubtedly due to
impacts of historic cultivation. Intensive inspection, however, yielded evidence of a Native
American lithic scatter intermixed in the outcrop of glacial till. Numerous tested cobbles
were observed, along with decortication, secondary, and tertiary flakes, as well as fragments
of percussion shatter. Flakes, shatter, and tested cobbles of several types of chert, and
quartzite were observed in the scatter. Some flakes observed in the assemblage appear to
have been heat treated. </P>

conducted, but no additional artifacts or associated historic features were observed.</P>

<P>	The archeological integrity of this site has been impacted by years of cultivation. In
addition, water and wind erosion appears to have deflated this upland setting. In 1998, some
precipitation runoff downcutting of surface soils was witnessed, and has probably occurred

In 1998, this field was cultivated in corn, providing more than 80 percent ground surface
visibility.</P>

<P>	The UNL Summer Field School, Stevens Creek Archeological Project (SCAP),
originally documented this Euroamerican archeological site in 1987. Field notations and a
non-systematic collection of artifacts were conducted in 1987 under the Field Number
SCAP87-14. In 1987, UNL researchers did not request a formal site number for this site.
Notes and artifacts from the 1987 Field School are located at the UNL Anthropology
Department.</P>

<P>	Artifacts observed, or collected in 1987, include common red brick and limestone
fragments with lime mortar, suggesting they represent remnants of a structural foundation.
Flatglass from windows, numerous ferrous cut-nails, cast iron stove parts, and a ferrous lock
escutcheon were also observed or collected. Utilitarian wares include various stonewares
with Albany, mocha, and Bristol slips. Some stoneware sherds collected in 1987 are salt-glazed. Other ceramics include a diverse assortment of whiteware and porcelain with flow-blue, hand-painted, and transfer print decorations. Bottleglass includes brown, clear, sun-altered, white, and green glass, as well as several sherds of milk-glass. Of the 12 bottle
finishes collected in 1987, 11 were hand-finished. A 1903 Indian-Head penny, a piece of
ornate cast-iron hardware, and a pair of 6-inch "hog-ring" pliers were also collected from the
surface in 1987. Both cinder and unburned coal were observed on the site surface. An artifact
assemblage similar to that reported in 1987 was observed on the surface in 1998, although
no artifacts were collected in 1998.</P>

<P>	Site disturbance at 25LC114 has been significant. The 1964 USGS Walton
Quadrangle 7.5 Minute Topographic Map does not show a structure at that location,
indicating that the demolition of the farmstead structures occurred prior to that date. The
location has apparently been cultivated since the removal of the structures. If any intact

<P>	This archeological site was originally documented in 1987 by the UNL Summer Field

SCAP87-15. In 1987, UNL researchers did not request a formal site number. A non-systematic collection of artifacts was conducted in 1987. Field notes and artifacts from the
1987 Field School are curated at the UNL Anthropology Department.</P>

<P>	Artifacts observed, or collected in 1987, include numerous types of chert and
quartzite flakes and percussion shatter. In 1987, a retouched flake, and two nearly complete
side-notched projectile points, 24 mm long by 13 mm wide by 2 mm thick, and 23 mm long
by 16 mm wide by 2.5 mm thick were collected. These projectile points are representative
of the Late Plains Village Period, or the Early Historic Period (ca. 500 - 150 BP). The distal
end of third projectile point was also collected, and measures 22 mm long by 14 mm wide
by 4 mm thick. This projectile point may be a fragment of a larger style point. Univalve and
bivalve shells were also collected in 1987. In 1998, the artifact assemblage was similar to
that reported in 1987, although no diagnostic tools were located in the recent survey.</P>

<P>	Site disturbance at 25LC115 has been significant. A Euroamerican farmstead site
(25LC114) is located immediately adjacent to this site, and some collecting of surface
artifacts may have been conducted by the occupants of that farmstead. The location has also
been cultivated for many years. In addition, a precipitation runoff wash runs downslope,
southeast, across the area of surface artifacts. Some soil deflation and artifact disturbance in
this area was evident in 1998.</P>

<P>	A total of 39 shovel tests, were excavated at this site. A north-south grid system was
established, and 33 shovel tests were excavated at varying intervals (7m to 30m) across the
site. In addition, six randomly placed shovel tests were excavated at random near the
southern extent of the artifact scatter. In total, seven shovel tests contained artifacts, three
were positive with lithics, and four contained historic materials. These artifacts were
recovered from the upper 10-40 cmbs, which comprises the current plowzone, and layers of
historic alluvium. The plowzone depth at this site increased with tests located lower on the
terrace slope due to alluvial deposition.</P>

<P>	A 1 m x 0.5 m test unit was excavated near the center of the surface scatter along on
the lower slope. A patchy and discontinuous alluvium deposited subsequent to the last
cultivation is present across much of the surface of the lower slope. The upper few
centimeters of soil in these alluvial areas is a very loose, gray-brown sandy-loam (10YR5/2)
with horizonation visible in the profile. Below this level, the current cultivation zone is
approximately 12 cm deep. This "reduced tillage" zone is a non-compacted, uniform gray-brown sandy-loam (10YR4/1) with a small amount of pea-sized gravel. From 12 cmbs to
roughly 72 cmbs, the matrix gradually grades to a brown silty-clay-loam (10YR3/3), with
the clay content increasing with depth. An irregular, but abrupt change in the soil matrix to
a very dark-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR2/2) is present at 72 cmbs. This level appears to be
the base of the original plowzone. The plowzone has been raised to its current level through
erosion from upslope agrading in the lower area. This very dark-brown soil continued
downward to 1 mbs where excavation was halted. No artifacts were recovered from this
excavation unit.</P>

<P>	A second test unit was excavated on up the terrace slope above the first test unit. This
1 m x 0.5 m unit was excavated in an area where three shovel tests proved positive and
contained lithic material. The current reduced tillage plowzone comprises the upper 12 cmbs
in this area, and consists of a non-compacted dark-grayish-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR3/2).
The soil matrix is a compact olive-brown silty-clay (10YR4/2) with yellowish-brown
mottling (10YR5/4) from 12 cmbs to 35 cmbs. Excavation was halted at 35 cmbs. No
artifacts were recovered from this test unit.<FONT COLOR="#00007f"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>	This scatter of artifacts appears to curve around foot of the terrace slope in a semi-circle, therefore, a series of shovel tests were excavated in an arc across the scatter. A total
of 15 shovel tests were excavated through recent alluvium, through the plowzone, and into
the subsurface to an average depth of 45-50 cmbs. Five of these shovel tests contained lithic
flakes, all within the upper 10-to-15 cm of the plowzone. One shovel test contained a
whiteware sherd. On some portions of the lower slope, the upper 2-to-6 cm of the surface is
covered with recent alluvium, deposited subsequent to the last spring plowing. </P>

<P>	Three shovel tests excavated upslope at 10 m intervals, revealed far fewer glacial
cobbles contained within the fill. The upper slope plowzone is composed of a gray-brown
silt-loam (10YR5/2), with a large amount of organic material. The two southernmost shovel
tests revealed a distinct soil change at 25-to-30 cmbs, with the fill becoming a buff sandy-silt
(10YR6/4). No flakes are present on the surface immediately surrounding these shovel tests,
and no artifacts were recovered in these tests.</P>

<P>	One shovel test located near the center of the scatter was expanded into a test unit
measuring 1 m X 0.5 m. In this area, the recent alluvium deposition was somewhat deeper
than other areas of the site. This test unit indicated that the upper 6 cm of alluvium is a non-compacted gray-brown sandy-silt-loam (10YR5/2) with fine banding of lighter gray silt loam
(10YR6/2). This alluvium revealed semi-horizontal bedding, and contained no glacial
cobbles and only small pea-gravel, indicating that it has accumulated since the most recent
plowing. A large amount of undecayed organic matter is also included within this alluvium
layer.</P>

<P>	The modern plowzone 6-to-30 cmbs contains a large amount of glacial cobbles, pea-gravel, and organic material mixed in during plowing. The matrix is a gray-brown silt-clay-loam (10YR5/3). From 30-to-52 cmbs the matrix grades to a brown clay-loam (10YR4/2)
with a large amount of glacial till cobbles. A ferrous drive-chain link was recovered from 46
cmbs. Combined with a whiteware sherd recovered from a shovel test at approximately 40
cmbs, these suggest this deeper level was once the plowzone, but ongoing erosion from
upslope has aggraded on the surface at the foot of this slope, and the plows no longer reach
this depth. There is a distinct transformation in the fill near 52-to-55 cmbs. Glacial cobbles
are dominant at this level, contained in a buff-brown clay-loam matrix (10YR6/3).</P>

gilt edged, pressed, hand-painted, and flow-blue designs. Other ceramic artifacts included
several electric insulators, light fixtures, a brown glazed doorknob, and fragments of 4" clay
tile pipe. Bottleglass included brown, blue, green, white, milk-glass, clear, and sun-altered.
Complete bottles were not observed, but several finishes and bases were inspected, including
both hand finished and machine made bottles. Flatglass from windows, and mirror plate glass

probably increased the extent of the glacial till outcrop. Such erosion continues as an
ongoing impact. In 1998, clear evidence of water erosion was present, including transported
soils and sloped surface downcutting. Small pockets of secondarily deposited, size-sorted
flakes further indicate recent, direct impact to the artifact assemblage.</P>

impacted the site area. Given the site type of 25LC128, a lithic procurement site where
glacial till was utilized for stone tool material, there is little chance for subsurface cultural

<P>This site is a scatter of artifacts which includes both lithic material and pottery, and
covers more than 20,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> (215,200 sq ft). In 1998, this field was cultivated in corn,
providing roughly 40 percent ground surface visibility.</P>

<P>	This archeological site was originally documented in 1987 by the UNL Summer Field
School's Stevens Creek Archeological Project (SCAP), and assigned the field number
SCAP87-5. UNL researchers did not request a formal site number in 1987. A non-systematic
collection of artifacts was conducted in 1987. Artifacts were noted both north, and south of
a modern roadway. Fields notes and artifacts from the 1987 Field School are curated at the
UNL Anthropology Department.</P>

<P>	Lithics collected in 1987, include patterned tools, flakes and percussion shatter from
a multitude of chert types, several colors and textures of quartzite, and Smoky Hill jasper.
Finished tools include a gray chert, thumb-scraper measuring 32 mm in diameter, and several
chert biface fragments. Several retouched flakes, a bifacial preform and four chert cores were
also collected. A large amount of fire-cracked rock was observed on the site surface in 1987,
and a number of these fragments were collected.</P>

<P>Collected projectile points from 1987, include the basal portions of two gray chert
points, a point mid-section, and a nearly complete projectile point. The two basal portions
are gray chert, much like Nehawka materials, and represent the bases of corner-notched
points. Both base portions measure 17 mm in width and are basally thinned, one with a
concave base, the other base is convex. The bifacially flaked mid-section is manufactured
from a brown chert, and appears to represent a more lanceolate point style of unknown
finished length. The fragment is 29 mm wide by 9 mm thick. A nearly complete projectile
point collected in 1987, is a triangular, corner-notched, basally thinned point manufactured
from a reddish-brown chert. It is missing only approximately 4 mm of the distal end, the
remainder measuring 34 mm long by 20 mm wide by 6 mm thick.</P>

<P>	Numerous pottery body sherds were also collected in 1987. The majority of sherds
measured between 7 and 9 mm thick, were grit tempered, and cord marked, although a few
fragments were less than 5 mm thick with a smooth exterior finish. No rims or necks were
collected, and it has not yet been determined if the cord-marked exteriors are regularized,
with diagnostic, identifiable patterning. None of the sherds collected in 1987 measured larger
than 10 mm in diameter, however, making any such pattern analysis difficult.</P>

<P>	During the 1998 field investigation, researchers observed pottery, a large amount of
fire-cracked rock, as well as flakes and percussion shatter of various chert and quartzite
material. Only one patterned artifact, the proximal end of a dark-gray chert projectile point,
was collected. This projectile point is corner-notched, and is basally thinned. The edges of
the remaining point portion are parallel, indicating that, when complete, the point was
somewhat lanceolate in form. The remaining point fragment is 26 mm in length by 23 mm
in width. It is 7 mm thick, and the corner-notching narrows the basal end to 12 mm in width.</P>

<P>	Cultivation, and wind and water erosion have impacted the archeological integrity
of 25LC129. In addition, artifacts are present along both sides of the existing roadway. This
indicates that the construction of the existing road through that terrace impacted, and
probably destroyed, a portion of the site across the center of site 25LC129.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00007f">	</FONT>A series of systematic shovel tests was excavated along a grid system across this site,
both north and south of the roadway. North of roadway, an east-west transect of seven shovel
tests, spaced at 20 m intervals, and extended from the bottomland, upslope to the west and
ending at the top of the stream terrace, and out of the proposed EM-1 survey corridor. Ten
more shovel tests were excavated along north-south transects in the area of the artifact
scatter. The depth of these shovel tests extended to at least 45 cmbs. Three shovel tests
within the corridor contained lithic artifacts. These artifacts included chert and quartzite
flakes, and fire-cracked rock fragments. Two shovel tests located on the terrace, but outside
the proposed EM-1 corridor, also contained lithic flakes.</P>

<P>An east-west oriented transect of five shovel tests, spaced at 20 m intervals, was
excavated approximately 50 m south of the roadway. These tests extended from the
bottomland, west, upslope onto the terrace slope. Again, these shovel tests were excavated
to approximately 45 cmbs. Two of these shovel tests were positive with lithic materials and
artifacts included fire-cracked rock, and reworked/utilized chert flake. Also, a third shovel
test was positive and contained several historic items, including wire nails and burned glass,
and coal cinders.</P>

<P>Approximately 200 m south of the roadway, two north-south oriented transects of
shovel tests were conducted spaced at 20 m intervals. Six more tests were excavated on the
lower edge of the terrace within the proposed EM-1 corridor. Five of these shovel tests
contained historic artifacts within the plowzone. These included both wire and cut ferrous
nails, flatglass, ferrous metal fragments, and several whiteware sherds. One shovel test
contained fire-cracked rock in the lower portion of the test (&gt;30cmbs). This shovel test was
expanded to approximately 50 cm in diameter, and was excavated to 75 cmbs, but no other
artifacts were encountered.</P>

<P>	A test unit was excavated on the eastern slope of the portion of stream terrace located
north of the roadway. The plowzone in this area extends to 24 cmbs and consists of a non-compacted dark-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR2/2). Three fragments of fire-cracked rock and
two chert flakes were recovered from the plowzone of this test unit. At roughly 24 cmbs,
there is an irregular, but rather abrupt change in soil to a brown silty-clay-loam (10YR 4/2).
At 36 cmbs, a thin lens of buff-yellow (10YR7/4) sand, extends into the unit within this
level. Two chert flakes were recovered from the surface of this sand layer, and a fragment
of fire-cracked rock was present within the sand layer, indicating that intact subsurface
material and features appear to be present at this site. It was not determined whether this sand
layer was a natural or cultural feature, but the presence of these artifacts at the sand level
suggests the possibility of an occupation surface. Below this sand level, the soil gradually
grades to a yellowish-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR5/4), with no well defined break in soil
color. At 80-to-84 cmbs, lighter yellow-brown mottling appears in the soil. From that depth,
the soil continues to grade to an even lighter yellowish-brown silty-clay (10YR6/4) at 1 m
in depth. Excavation was halted at 1 m.</P>

<P>	A second test unit, a 1 m x 0.5 m excavation, was located south of the roadway,
within an area of an artifact scatter, and near a positive shovel test. The plowzone, roughly
26 cm in depth, consists of a very-dark-brown silty-loam (10YR2/2). The soil matrix is a
dark-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR3/3) from 26-to-47 cm. A chert flake, and the distal end
of a Smoky Hill Jasper biface, possibly a projectile point or knife fragment, were recovered
within this level. This indicates that intact, subsurface artifacts appear to exist at this site. At
51 cmbs, a gradual transformation in soil texture and color was encountered, and soils
changed to a yellowish-brown silty-clay (10YR5/3) with lighter yellowish-brown mottling
(10YR5/6). Excavation was halted at 70 cmbs.<FONT COLOR="#00007f"></FONT></P>

cultivated in corn, providing approximately 30 percent ground surface visibility.</P>

<P>	An abandoned, dilapidated wood-framed corn crib, remains standing at this site. This
structure appears on the 1972 Photorevised USGS Waverly Quadrangle 7.5 Minute
Topographic Map, but no other structures are illustrated. The 1964 USGS Walton
Quadrangle 7.5 Minute Topographic Map does not show a structure at this location either,
indicating that the demolition of the majority of farmstead structures occurred prior to 1964.</P>

<P>	Artifacts observed include common red brick and limestone fragments with lime
mortar, suggesting they represent remnants of a structural foundation. Flatglass from
windows, and numerous ferrous cut-nails were also observed. Ceramics included a small
assortment of whiteware and earthenware, representing various utilitarian vessels. Bottleglass
included brown, clear, sun-altered, white, and green glass. Both cinder and unburned coal
were observed on the site surface.</P>

<P>	Site disturbance at the historic 25LC130 has been significant. The site area has
apparently been cultivated since the farmstead structures were removed. If any intact features
or undisturbed archeological context remains, it will be the remnants of foundations, cellars,

<P>	The locational information already collected at 25LC130 is adequate to address issues
of human land-use and historic settlement patterns. Additional archeological investigation
is unlikely to yield information regarding local or regional history that is not already
available in an archival format. These factors, combined with the absence of significant
events or people associated with this site limit the research potential of 25LC130. While this
site does appear to meet minimum age requirements for NRHP eligibility, it currently fails
to meet the additional criteria necessary to recommend its protection.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC130 is recommended not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Additional

<P><STRONG>25LC131 (EBAP98-20):</STRONG></P>

<P>Site 25LC131 is a diffuse lithic scatter that covers approximately 3,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> (10,000
sq ft). In 1998, the field was planted in corn, providing 50 percent ground surface visibility.</P>

<P>Chert and quartzite flakes and percussion shatter were observed on the surface of this
site. The scatter spreads across the top of a rise, extending northward from the fence line
along a roadway. Several artifacts were also observed south of the road. Intensive survey of
the areas yielded no tools, or other patterned artifacts.</P>

<P>	Impacts to the 25LC131 site include cultivation and wind and water erosion. In
addition, construction of the roadway and the adjacent drainage ditches appear to have
bisected 25LC131, impacting and probably destroying a major portion of this site. In fact,
the portion of the site located south of the roadway is approximately 3 m higher than the area
north of roadway, indicating substantial earth movement and removal associated with the
construction of the road.</P>

<P>	A total of 29 shovel tests were excavated at this site. These included 15 placed south
of the road and 14 placed north of the road. These shovel tests were excavated through the
plowzone and into subsoils to an average depth of 40 cmbs. The first transect placed south
of the road, consisted of seven shovel tests, and was oriented in an east-west direction,
spaced approximately 4 m apart. Five tests were excavated at right angles to this transect, and
three additional shovel tests were randomly placed according to the amount of cultural
material observed on the ground surface. </P>

<P>	North of the road, an east-west transect of eight shovel tests was established and
excavated at 4 m intervals. Two short transects were excavated north from this east-west grid
for a total of 14 shovel tests. </P>

<P>An test unit was excavated on either side of the road, and the first was placed along
the east-west transect south of the roadway. The bottom of the plowzone in this area
extended to roughly 28 cmbs. The plowzone soil was a dark brown clayey-loam (10YR2/2).
The bottom of the plowzone was irregular, with an abrupt transformation to a lighter-brown
silty-clay-loam (10YR4/3). This excavation unit extended to 75 cmbs with a gradation of soil
color to a gray-brown sandy-loam (10YR5/2) at around 70cmbs.</P>

<P>	On the north side of the roadway, a shovel test was expanded into a test unit
measuring 1 m X 0.5 m. Glacial cobbles measuring up to 12 cm in diameter were scattered
across the surface in this area. The plowzone extended to approximately 30 cmbs. The
plowzone matrix is a brown sandy-loam (10YR4/2) with gravel and a moderate amount of
small glacial till cobbles. Below the plowzone, the gravel and till mixture continues and is
contained in a matrix of yellowish-brown sandy-loam (10YR5/4). This soil remained
uniform down to 70 cmbs where the test unit excavation was halted.</P>

<P>No artifacts were recovered as a result of shovel testing at this site. Subsurface testing
confirmed that this site is heavily deflated, and almost devoid of topsoil. In addition, other
than the artifacts located on the surface, no artifacts were present in the test units.</P>

<P>This site is a lithic scatter that covers approximately 3,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> (32,000 sq ft). In 1998,
this field was cultivated and ground surface visibility consisted of 10-to-20 percent
throughout most of the field.</P>

<P>Artifacts present at this site included several types of chert and quartzite flakes and
percussion shatter. Several retouched flakes were also observed. A small, side-notched chert
projectile point measuring 28 mm long, by 14 mm wide, by 4 mm thick was collected from
the surface of 25LC132. </P>

<P>	Impacts at 25LC132 include cultivation and water erosion, as well as earth moving
activities. In 1998, evidence of soil erosion was visible in runoff downcutting along the
terrace slope. In addition, mechanized soil movement aimed at reducing, or controlling
precipitation runoff may have impacted the southern edge of this site. A clearly artificial
drainage, leading to a small water retention dam abuts the southern edge of the terrace.</P>

<P>	A north-south oriented transect of seven shovel tests was excavated at 10 m intervals
across the center of the terrace and the artifact scatter. A second transect consisting of five
shovel tests was then excavated at a right angle, east-west across the terrace. Seven shovel
tests were randomly placed along the top of the terrace. Finally, five shovel tests were
positioned on the bottomland near the foot of the terrace. Each shovel test was excavated to
a minimum depth of 45 cmbs. Researchers expanded two of these shovel tests to
approximately 50 cm in diameter, and 75 cm in depth. All shovel tests excavated at this site
tested negative for cultural material.</P>

<P>	A 1m x 0.5 m test unit was excavated near the center of the terrace. The surface soil
is a dark gray-brown sandy-clay-loam (10YR4/2). The crop was "drilled-in", (a special
planting method) and no typical plowzone is present on the terrace. The upper 12-to-15 cm
is a dense root zone in a soil matrix of dark-gray-brown sandy-clay-loam (10YR4/2). Below
this dense root zone, to approximately 38 cmbs, the soil is a yellowish-brown silty-clay-loam
(10YR4/6). At 38 cmbs, the soil begins a gradual gradation, becoming a lighter yellowish-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR5/4) with yellowish-brown mottling (10YR5/7) at 55 cmbs. The
color remains relatively constant to the bottom of the test unit, but at around 95 cmbs, a few
small (&lt; 5 mm) reddish-brown concretions (2.5YR3/4) appear in the soil. Excavation was
halted at 1 m.</P>

<P>	A second, rather crude 1.5 m x 0.5 m test unit was placed at the upper edge of the
stream terrace. Once again, the surface was heavily vegetated with a dense root zone. A small
portion of the profile contained a thin surface layer of dark-brown silty-loam (10YR3/2).
Making up the sloped surface across the remainder of the profile and extending to roughly
15 cmbs is a soil matrix of dark-gray-brown sandy-clay-loam (10YR4/2). At roughly 42 cm
from the top of the sloped profile, and running horizontally across the unit was a band of
yellowish-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR4/6). Again, this soil gradually grades to a lighter
yellowish-brown silty-clay-loam (10YR5/4) with yellowish-brown mottling (10YR5/7) near
60 cmbs. At 94 cmbs, the soil color and texture remains constant, but small (&lt; 5 mm)
reddish-brown concretions (2.5YR3/4) appear in the soil. Excavation was halted at 1 m.</P>

<P>	A shovel test on the bottomland below the terrace edge was expanded, first to around
50 cm in diameter and 75-80 cm in depth, then further expanded to a crude test unit
measuring roughly 1 m x 0.5 m. The upper 12 cmbs is a dense root-zone contained in a
matrix of yellowish-brown clay-loam (10YR5/3). Two colors of soil appear immediately
below the root zone. Part of the unit contains a brown silty-clay-loam (10YR4/2). The profile
indicates this brown soil has been laid over a deposit of yellowish-brown clay-loam
(10YR5/6). A thin, 2-to-3 cm layer of sandy pea gravel angles across the unit below these
two soils. Below this gravel, along one-half of the unit, is a deposit of dark-brown silty-loam
(10YR3/3) mixed with pea-gravel. The base of this feature reveals a regularized pattern of
impressions left by a tracked vehicle. Immediately below this is a layer of yellowish-brown
clay-loam (10YR5/4) extending to 55 cmbs. At this level there is an abrupt transformation
to a black silty-clay-loam (10YR2/1). This level contains a large amount of organics,
including undecayed cornstalks. At approximately 86 cmbs an irregular line runs across the
unit. This appears to be the remnant of the bottom of a plowzone. There is no easily
discernable color change, and the line is definable only because of soil texture and organic
content. Below this layer, a black-to-very dark brown silty-clay-loam (10YR2/2) continues
downward to 1 m where excavation was discontinued. </P>

<P>The irregularity and pattern of these deposits, along with the mechanized vehicle
tracks indicate that deposits of various soils have been deposited to raise this surface,
possibly to fill a wetland or wet-meadow, thereby making a cultivatable surface. The
presence of deeply buried, undecayed corn stalks, suggests that this soil movement has
occurred within recent times, probably at the same time the drainage and water retention
structures were completed.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"></FONT></P>

25LC135 is actually located outside the one-quarter mile-wide corridor of EC-1, but was
encountered as crews crossed a field to reach the survey area. The cemetery was recorded
because it dates to quite early in the settlement period, and because it is not shown on the

in heavy prairie grasses, which provided no ground surface visibility.</P>

<P>	Only two gravestones stand above the native grasses. One stone, a white granite spire,
approximately 90 cm (3 ft) tall, is engraved "Louisa ….?, Born in St. ….?, died 1870." The
second stone is tabular, approximately 76 cm (2.5 ft) tall, and is engraved "Corp. James
Cattern, Co. 1, 8 IA Inf. 1817-1890" and "Elizabeth his wife, 1813-1890, A War Mother."
Along each side of this large stone is a small surface-flush stone. The stone on the right is
engraved "Mother" and the stone on the left is engraved "Father." While these are the only
stones visible on the surface, numerous surface irregularities indicate that other, unmarked
graves undoubtedly exist in this area.</P>

<P>	This site is consists of a very diffuse scatter of lithics encompassing approximately
10,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> (110,000 sq ft). In 1998, this field was cultivated in beans, providing greater than
90 percent ground surface visibility.</P>

<P>Artifacts at this site include various types of chert and quartzite flakes, and chert and
quartzite percussion shatter. Several fragments of fire-cracked rock were also observed in the
scatter. Few lithic artifacts were observed on the top of the terrace. The majority of
prehistoric artifacts are eroding from the southern face of the slope, although the diffuse
nature and broad area over which artifacts were observed make it difficult to identify the
actual point of origin. No patterned tools, or other identifying artifacts were observed.</P>

<P>The archeological integrity of this site has been impacted by cultivation. In addition,
evidence of some water runoff erosion was apparent in 1998. Both surface wash across the
slope and some topsoil downcutting was observed during survey.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>Subsurface testing at this site included three transects of shovel tests excavated at 10
m intervals. These transects were placed to cross the site terrace at the top, near the middle
and at the bottom. A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated through the plowzone, roughly
23 cm deep, to a minimum of 40 cmbs. A total of 8 shovel tests proved positive. Three of
these tests yielded one chert flake, each contained within the plowzone. Within the
plowzone, historic debris was found in five shovel additional tests. These artifacts included
ferrous wire and cut nails, glass, two types of ceramic electric insulators, ferrous metal
fragments, wood screws, and fragments of burned wood. </P>

<P>The surface soils on this cultivated terrace remnant indicate severe erosional
deflation. The plowzone portion of shovel tests near the top of the terrace is composed of a
dark-grayish-brown silty-clay (10YR4/2) to approximately 20-23 cmbs. This soil matrix
continues downward, in places beyond the 40-45 cm depth of the shovel tests, but in other
places graded to a grayish-brown silty-clay-loam (2.5Y5/2) near the bottom of the shovel
tests. On the lower slopes of the terrace, the surface soils are grayish-brown silty-clays
(2.5YR4/2), which extend to the bottom of the tests.</P>

<P>Although the southern terrace remnant and the lowland that separates the two terraces
were outside of the ¼ mile corridor of the proposed EC-1 route, shovel tests were placed
across these landforms to better define the extent of the site. Lithic debitage is present on the
ground surface of the southern terrace, and artifact density is greater on this terrace than on
the northern terrace. A series of six shovel tests were excavated mid-slope and three shovel
tests were placed near the top of the southern terrace. As on the northern terrace, the surface
soils are grayish-brown silty-clays (2.5YR4/2), which extend to the bottoms of the tests at
40-to-45 cmbs. Lithic material was recovered from two shovel tests although again, it was
contained within the plowzone.</P>

<P>In addition to the shovel tests described above, twelve shovel tests were excavated
in a lowland area between the two terraces. This lowland was very moist when previously
surveyed, was still moist when subsurface tests were conducted in October of 1998. It was
not determined if the moisture is from natural sub-irrigation, or if the lowland acts as a
precipitation runoff basin. One of these tests was expanded to 50 cm diameter, and excavated
to 80 cm in depth. The plowzone in this area is approximately 23 cmbs and is a dark-drayish-brown silty-clay-loam (7.5YR3/0). An abrupt change, to a black silty-clay (10YR2/1) occurs
immediately below the plowzone. This black, clayey matrix continues downward,
unchanged, to at least 80 cmbs where excavation was halted.</P>

<P>In this series of 12 shovel tests, five proved positive for artifacts. A shovel test
excavated near the foot of the southern terrace remnant contained a quartzite flake in the
plowzone portion of the soil matrix. Historic artifacts were uncovered in four shovel tests
excavated. These artifacts included flatglass, ferrous nails, a 4" butt-hinge, a wad of small-gauge copper wire, whiteware sherds, and cinder. These artifacts are similar in nature to the
historic artifacts contained in the tests on the terrace, and are undoubtedly related to the
historic schoolhouse that once sat on the NE corner of this section.</P>

<P>	A test unit was excavated about midway up the terrace slope. The plowzone in this
area is a grayish-brown silty-clay (2.5YR4/2). This matrix extends below the plowzone to
approximately 35 cmbs where the soil rapidly grades to a grayish-brown silty-clay
(10YR5/3) with distinct brown mottling (10YR6/8) and small (&lt;4 mm) lime concretions.
This soil continued to 60 cmbs where excavation was halted.</P>

vegetated in floodplain forest and scrub-thicket undergrowth.</P>

<P>	This site is a steam engine farm tractor resting on the streambed, and partially buried
in the south stream bank. The water tank is visible, extending outward from the bank.
According to historic accounts (personal communication, Raymond Kettlehut, relaying the
story told to him by his father) the steam engine fell from a bridge in the early 1900's while
trying to cross from the south to the north side of the stream, rupturing the pressure tank. The
owner then hired a crew of men who worked several days trying, unsuccessfully, to recover
the engine. All the visible individual pieces that could be unbolted from the water tank, such
as the smokestack and tank front cover have been removed, and it is not known how
complete the buried portion of the tractor is. It is probable that all the salvageable parts were
removed from the tractor once it was determined that the tractor could not be recovered. </P>

<P>	Impacts at 25LC141 are difficult to evaluate. It appears that erosion, bank slumping,
and deposition have buried the larger part of the tractor in the stream's southern bank. The
natural acidic nature of the local soils, combined with the constant moisture of the stream,
may have precipitated the oxidation of the buried ferrous metals. In addition, the freeze-thaw

<P>	This glacial till outcrop has a locally typical makeup of granite, quartzite, chert, and
basalt stream-worn cobbles. The presence of this glacial till complicated survey of this
location, requiring intensive inspection of a large amount of surface materials. Many cobbles
reveal plow/disc scars, and some portion of the broken cobbles observed are undoubtedly due
to impacts of historic cultivation. Careful inspection in one area of the outcrop, however,
yielded evidence of a lithic scatter intermixed in the outcrop of glacial till. Numerous tested
cobbles were observed, along with decortication and secondary flakes, as well as fragments
of percussion shatter. Flakes, shatter, and tested cobbles of several types of chert, and
quartzite were observed in the scatter. </P>

<P>	Impacts at 25LC142 include plowing and water erosion. The removal of the natural
vegetation cover, followed by years of plowing and the impacts of erosion, has undoubtedly
increased the extent of the glacial till outcrop. Only a relatively small section of the outcrop,

may be impacted or destroyed.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>After test excavations and inspection of stratigraphy, no cultural explanations could
be found, and these depressions were determined to be natural erosional features.</P>

<P>	As such, this site is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and is not considered
to have cultural origins. Additional archeological investigation is not necessary, and
avoidance of this area if construction proceeds along the proposed EF-1 is not required. </P>

<P><STRONG>25LC146 (EBAP98-35):</STRONG></P>

<P>	This site consists of a lithic scatter within a small outcrop of glacial till, and a series
of small depressions. This site covers roughly 1,200 m<SUP>2</SUP> (13,000 sq ft). In 1998, the field
where the lithic scatter is located was cultivated in soybeans, providing greater than 90
percent ground surface visibility</P>

<P>Site 25LC146 appears to extend southward, across a roadway. In 1998, the ground
surface south of the road was heavily vegetated with prairie grasses, providing no surface
visibility. Surface irregularities and three relatively evenly spaced depressions 5-to-8 m (16-26 ft) in diameter were observed, suggesting possible cultural features. </P>

<P>	The glacial till outcrop located north of the roadway contains a locally typical
makeup of granite, quartzite, chert, and basalt cobbles. The presence of the glacial till
complicated surface survey, and an intensive inspection of a large amount of surface
materials was necessary. Many cobbles have plow/disc scars, and some broken cobbles
observed at this location are undoubtedly due to impacts of historic cultivation. However,
evidence of a lithic scatter intermixed in the outcrop of glacial till was apparent. Numerous
tested cobbles were observed, along with decortication, and secondary flakes, as well as
fragments of percussion shatter. Flakes, shatter, and tested cobbles of several types of chert,
and quartzite were observed in the scatter. </P>

<P>The portion of 25LC146 located north of the roadway has been impacted by
cultivation. In addition, construction of the road bisected the terrace remnant, removing a
significant section across the terrace, undoubtedly destroying a major portion across the
center of this site.</P>

<P>	Heavy, tall mixed-grass vegetation covers the ground surface of this site, obscuring
the depressions located during pedestrian survey. As these depressions were re-defined in
preparation for testing, it became clear that only one depression, Depression 1, was clearly
defined and flagged around the entire circumference. Two other, apparently smaller
depressions were less well defined. Depression 2, extends northward, and is bisected by the
road. Only a small portion of Depression 3 could be identified.</P>

<P>	A series of eight shovel tests were excavated along an east-west transect crossing
Depression 1, and extending into Depression 3. In addition, two shovel tests were placed at
the edge of Depression 1. Three more shovel tests were placed just outside Depression 1, and
an additional shovel test was placed near the centers of Depression 2 and 3. The shovel tests
were excavated to an average of 45 cmbs, although the test in the center of the main
depression was enlarged and excavated to 65 cmbs. Several historic artifacts, including glass,
nails, and metal were recovered from these shovel tests.</P>

<P>	One shovel test, located along the edge of Depression 1, was expanded into a test unit
measuring 1 m X 1 m. The upper 10-to-12 cmbs contains a dense grass root zone, and the
soil is a uniform grayish-brown sandy-loam with a small amount of pea-gravel (10YR4/1).
Below this level, from around 12-to-20 cmbs a layer of dark gray-brown sandy-loam
(10YR3/1) with pea-gravel is present. Contained within the depression, from 20-to-42 cmbs,
a series of different matrix types is present and is mixed with historic artifacts. The
stratigraphy indicates separate dumping events. One dumping event left a dark-brown sandy-loam (10YR3/2) with milled wood, wire nails, flatglass, and ferrous "Schlitz" beer cans. A
second dumping event left a soil matrix of reddish-brown, very-sandy-loam (2.5YR3/4). This
soil contains screw-top bottleglass, tin cans, a small ferrous hasp, a 4" ferrous T-hinge,
small-gauge ferrous wire, wire nails, and redbrick fragments. The color of the soil seemed
to be due to red brick dust, rather than to a natural cause. Below this feature, a small lens of
light-gray ash (7.5YR7/1) is apparent, and contains ferrous nails, and burned glass. On the
outer edge of the depression, from 12-to-34 cmbs a layer of soil that appears to be an old
plowzone is visible. This soil is very dark-brown sandy-clay-loam (10YR2/2) with small
cobbles and pea-gravel mixed throughout. The bottom of this depression is irregular and
rather abrupt. Below the feature, and extending across the entire unit, is a subsoil matrix of
gray-brown clay-loam (10YR5/3) with yellowish-brown mottling (10YR5/6) and carbonate
concretions. Excavation was halted at 60 cmbs.</P>

<P>	The second portion of this site, located north of the roadway, was also tested. A series
of 14 shovel tests were excavated in transects across the lithic scatter at 5 m intervals. Two
randomly placed shovel tests were also excavated. Shovel tests were excavated to an average
of 40 cmbs. One of the random tests was expanded to approximately 60 cm in diameter, and
extended to 60 cmbs. While this did not provide a clean profile, it did provide an opportunity
to inspect stratigraphy. The ground surface north of the road is densely littered with glacial
till outcrop gravels and cobbles up to 15 cm in diameter. The plowzone, which is difficult
to define, appears to extend to approximately 30 cmbs, and consists primarily of gravel and
cobbles, with a small amount of gray-brown clay-loam (10YR5/2) matrix. This soil
composition continues downward to 60 cmbs, where excavation of this test was halted.
Lithic artifacts were recovered from the upper 10-15 cmbs of three shovel tests.</P>

<P><U>25LC146 Recommendation and Evaluation:</U></P>

<P>This site, 25LC146, consists of a lithic scatter and several depressions. The site is
located within the proposed EM-1 corridor. If construction proceeds along this route, the site
may be impacted or destroyed.</P>

<P>	A series of three depressions are visible on the south side of the roadway. Subsurface
testing indicates that these depressions are historic in origin and they are probably remnants
of borrow pits subsequently used to deposit historic debris. On the north side of the roadway,
the site contains glacial till mixed with a scatter of lithic artifacts. Subsurface testing
indicates that the lithic artifacts present on the ground surface do not extend below the
plowzone, and the site area is heavily deflated. </P>

<P>	Both components of site 25LC146 are recommended not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP. Beyond the locational information already recorded, this site offers no research
potential. Additional archeological investigation or conservation is not required. Avoidance
or protection of this site during construction of the proposed EM-1 route is not necessary.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><STRONG>25LC147 (EBAP98-36):</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG>	This site number was assigned to an area where wagon ruts are visible. The area
where the tracks are visible is heavily vegetated in native grasses, and appears to be a small
section of virgin prairie.</P>

<P>The ruts proceed up-slope from the west edge of a stream, to near the summit of a
hill. The ruts are vaguely, and discontinuously discernible over a length of approximately ¼
mile. This historic trail may be related to the operation of the Shirley Road Ranch, which was
in operation from ca. 1866 to 1880. In addition, the location of these ruts is also in the
vicinity of the 1866 Road Number 324 as shown on Nebraska State Historical Society maps.
Determining the exact association of these ruts is not possible due to the relatively short
segment visible. West of the summit of the hill, the area is cultivated, and the ruts are not
visible. </P>

<P>	The site appears to be relatively intact through the area of what is assumed to be
virgin prairie. The greatest impact to portions of this linear site 25LC147 is plowing. The
field east of the stream, where the road would presumably continue after crossing the stream
ford, is cultivated, as is the field west of summit of the hill. Plowing has obliterated any
evidence of ruts, or a historic roadway that may have once crossed those fields.</P>

<P><U>25LC147 Recommendation and Evaluation:</U></P>

<P>This site, 25LC147, is an historic trail remnant. This linear site is located within the
proposed EC-1 corridor. If construction proceeds along this route, portions of this site will
be impacted and destroyed.</P>

<P>	The trail, which consists of ephemeral wheel ruts and a differentiation of associated
vegetation. This trail may be related to an early road ranch, or may be the remnants of a
historic road. In either case, this historic trail dates to circa 1860 - 1880.</P>

<P>	While only a small portion of this early historic trail is preserved, it dates to the
earliest settlement period of Lancaster County. This site does meet minimum age
requirements for NRHP eligibility, and may offer unique research opportunities.</P>

<P>	Site 25LC147 is recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP. If the EC-1
alternative is chosen, every effort should be made to avoid this site. If avoidance during
construction is not possible, mitigation should include detailed mapping and photo
documentation. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><STRONG>25LC148 (EBAP98-37):</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG>	This is a buried trash dump observed in a cutbank along an intermittent tributary
drainage and is estimated to cover 5 m<SUP>2</SUP> (55 sq ft). In 1998, vegetation in this field was mixed
pasture, reducing ground surface visibility to approximately 10 percent.</P>

<P>Refuse was observed buried in the cutbank, 30-to-50 cm (15-20 in) below the present
ground surface. Artifacts included glass bottles, automotive/machinery parts, wire fencing,
and tin cans. Based on the identifiable, diagnostic bottles, the refuse seems to represent a
depression era (1930's) time period.</P>

<P>A small section of the cutbank was scraped to reveal the stratigraphic profile. This
inspection revealed layering of horizontal bands, less that 5 mm (&lt; ¼ in) thick, of alluvial
deposition immediately over the historic refuse. This type of layered stratigraphy is caused
by repeated, low intensity depositional events, with each event leaving a thin deposit of
material. The lack of bioturbation, which would obscure the horizontal alluvial banding,
indicates the deposition occurred over a relatively brief time period. The upper 15-to-20 cm
(6-8 in) of profile contained no layering, indicating that the present surface has been stable
long enough for pedoturbation to obscure the alluvial deposition sequence.</P>

<P>	Erosion continues as an ongoing impact at this location. Previously, the site was
buried by alluvium that aggraded downslope. The deposition has stopped, or significantly
slowed, and the runoff is now downcutting through the easily erodable matrix, creating an
intermittent stream drainage with steep cutbank walls that reveal this buried site.</P>

<P><U>25LC148 Recommendation and Evaluation:</U></P>

<P>Site 25LC148 consists of a buried trash dump along a small tributary. The site is
located approximately within the proposed EM-1 corridor. If construction proceeds along
this route, 25LC148 may be impacted or destroyed.</P>

<P>	Historic material, such as glass bottles, tin cans and automotive related parts were
observed eroding out of the creek bank. No diagnostic materials were observed, and this
dumping episode appears to be recent and of relatively short duration.</P>

<P>	The locational information already collected at 25LC148 is adequate to address issues
of human land-use and historic settlement patterns. Additional archeological investigation
is unlikely to yield information regarding local or regional history that is not already
available in an archival format. These factors, combined with the absence of significant

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Arial"></U></STRONG></FONT>	In the course of this project, 46 previously unrecorded archeological sites (25LC93,
-25LC97; 25LC112 - 25LC148; EBAP98-38 - EBAP98-41) were documented. These sites
include four lithic procurement sites 25 lithic scatters, the archeological remnants of seven
Euroamerican farmsteads, two cinder scatters representing brief agricultural use, two
Euroamerican scatters, one Euroamerican dump, one Euroamerican cemetery, a steam
engine, a Euroamerican school, a segment of a Euroamerican trail and an unclassified artifact
scatter. In addition, one depression feature (SOAP97-2), determined to be non-cultural was
investigated. Of these newly documented sites, 25LC125, 25LC129, 25LC147 are
recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP; 25LC115, 25LC143, 25LC144 would
require additional archeological work should the nearby roadway alternative be selected; and
40 are recommended not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.</P>

<P><U></U>	Geomorphological investigations of the preferred alignment are recommended for
the SEB Project, and are outlined below. <U></U></P>

<P><U>Recommendations for Geologic Investigations</U>:</P>

<P>	The Salt Creek and Stevens Creek valleys are complex settings where landform-sediment assemblages have been produced by fluvial, eolian, and gravitational processes.
The region has been subject to periods of stability, evidenced by buried soil development,
and periods of instability, evidenced by floodplain aggradation, both of which can be seen
in cross-sections visible in stream cutbanks and road cuts. In addition, downcutting
combined with lateral stream meandering has resulted in stepped terrace sequences, and
alluvial fan and colluvial apron development.<STRONG><U></U></STRONG></P>

<P>	Deposits of fine-grained Holocene alluvium blanket all stream valleys and low
terraces in eastern Nebraska (Dillon 1992; Mandel 1994a; Mandel and Bettis 1995). The
floodplains of Salt Creek, Stevens Creek, and their major tributaries, likewise, represent
portions of the valley floors that are currently under construction. As active floodplains, they
are flooded frequently and at fairly regular recurrent intervals, receiving deposits of alluvium
with each flood cycle.</P>

<P>	Many studies (e.g., Artz 1985; Bettis and Benn 1984; Bettis and Thompson 1982;
Mandel 1992a, 1995a; Mandel et al. 1991; Thompson and Bettis 1980) have shown that the
presence of archeological materials on the surface of an alluvial landscape is dependent on
variables in that fluvial system. Prehistoric archeological materials will be found only where
there are deposits old enough to contain them, however, where sufficiently thick deposits
postdating an archeological site are present, evidence of that site will not be found on the
modern land surface (Bettis and Hoyer 1986).</P>

<P>	The absolute ages of the surface deposits on the floodplains, or mantling the lower
terraces in the SEB Study Area are unknown. Many parts of these valleys were underwater
as recently as 1993 (Lower Platte South NRD 1997). At several cutbank localities along the
main Salt Creek channel, south of Saltillo Road, historic debris was observed throughout
approximately 1.5 m (3 ft.) of upper extent of the unit. Historic debris was also observed
beneath 50-75 cm (1.5-2.5 ft.) of alluvium in cutbanks of upper tributary drainages. These
suggest that post settlement deposition may cover most of the stream crossings and lower
terraces, thereby concealing buried prehistoric, or early historic cultural resources that may
be present.</P>

<P>	It is recommended that a limited geomorphological investigation of the Salt Creek
and Stevens Creek valleys be conducted once routes are finalized. The specific objectives
of that investigation should be to:</P>

<P>(1) identify Holocene and late Wisconsinian landform-sediment assemblages;</P>

<P>(2) determine the relative ages of alluvial deposits and buried soils in stream
valleys;</P>

<P>(3) determine the geologic potential for <U>buried</U> archeological deposits within
the project impact zones.</P>

<P>Recognition of different landforms, combined with some subsurface examination and
possibly radiocarbon dating of the deposits composing them will permit a more complete
assessment of the geological potential for the preservation of archeological deposits (Bettis
and Hoyer 1986:10; Mandel 1992a, 1995a; Thompson and Bettis 1980:10-11).</P>
