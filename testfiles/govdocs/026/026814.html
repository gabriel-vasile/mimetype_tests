    <h1>Folk-Songs of America: The Robert Winslow Gordon Collection, 1922-1932</h1>
    <h2>Band B2</h2>
    <p> Fieldwork in Georgia gave Gordon an opportunity to do problem-oriented
      research in an area of folksong which, during the twenties, was the focus
      of extensive debate. Just as he sought evidence to establish the history
      of ballads like &quot;Old 97&quot; and lyric songs like &quot;The Prisoner's
      Song,&quot; he also sought the origin and development of spirituals.</p>
    <p> The debate about spirituals, which began after the Civil War, arose from
      the question of whether they were of black or white origin and, depending
      on one's point of view, whether they had been altered by one group or the
      other. Gordon spoke to the question twice; once in his article &quot;Negro
      Chants,&quot; in Folk-Songs of America and again in &quot;The Negro Spiritual,&quot; his
      contribution to the 1931 book The Carolina Low-Country (Smythe, pp. 191-222).
      In both articles he used as his principal piece of evidence Mary Mann's
      first song on this record.</p>
    <p> Gordon believed that &quot;a monotonous sing song chant its rhythm sometimes
      closely imitating that of a drum&quot; (Gordon, p. 34) represented the
      Negro's earliest attempt at religious song composition in English. These,
      which had as their unit the single line or, at most, the couplet, and in
      which the chorus was used irregularly (perhaps only when the singer was
      trying to remember more verses), were &quot;prior to regular adoption of
      white models.&quot; When such songs were sung in a group, the refrain was
      carried on in a nearly continuous way, providing a &quot;basing&quot; over
      which the lead soared.</p>
    <p> <a name="olmansatan"></a>Mary C. Mann's &quot;Ol' Man Satan/Drive Ol'
      Satan Away&quot; was evidence, Gordon believed, of &quot;the earliest text
      of a Negro spiritual that has ever been published.&quot; He explained:</p>
    <p>This song was a favorite with Amelia, a slave brought to this country
      prior to 1800 from the island of Madagascar. She taught it to her grand-daughter,
      Violet, and she in turn taught it to her granddaughter, Mary, from whom
      I obtained it. Amelia was one of a number of slaves captured by the British
      in the war of 1812 and taken to Nassau, in the Bahama Islands, whence she
      never returned. She must, therefore, have sung the song prior to this time.
      The evidence rests entirely upon tradition, but the scrupulous accuracy
      of my informant in many other statements made to me -- statements that
      I have been able to check in historical documents -- leads me to place
      great trust in her account (p. 39).</p>
    <p> He then printed the text. In his 1931 essay he called this an example
      of a pre-stanzic Negro spiritual which &quot;proceeds in surges rather
      than in stanzas&quot; (Smythe, p. 215). Gordon collected several songs
      in Georgia which parallel these texts (GA401, GA447).</p>
    <p> The song given here represents the usable portions of the two cylinders
      on which Gordon recorded it. Therefore this recording varies at several
      points from the texts as published by Gordon. In particular, the last six
      verses are omitted.</p>

    <p> <a name="fingerring"></a>Mary Mann's second song is, in her words, a &quot;boat
      song&quot;. Such songs are familiar in the Georgia Sea Islands. In &quot;Negro
      Work Songs From Georgia,&quot; Gordon described the rowing songs which
      he collected. He found them &quot;very close to spirituals&#8212;some of
      them are spirituals slightly made over.&quot; He described the long boats&#8212;cypress
      dug outs&#8212;and their crews of six to eight manning long sweeps, and
      then the songs as they were sung:</p>
    <p>The leader always sang the verses, usually in tenor voice, and the other
      rowers chanted the refrain in lower key. There was no pause, the lines
      overlapping each other with curious effectiveness. Though I print the songs
      in stanzaic form, the stanzas were not apparent in the singing (Gordon,
      p. 17).</p>
    <p> This song, like Mann's first, shares the non-stanzaic construction noted
      by Gordon for rowing songs. The contrast between strophic construction
      found in European folksong and the litany form found in Africa supports
      Gordon's argument that these songs in Mann's repertoire represent an early
      stage in the progress from African to Afro-American folksong traditions.
      Gordon collected several other rowing songs from Mann; he also collected
      another version of &quot;Finger Ring&quot; from a Darien informant (A285,
      GA75). Mann's statement at the end refers to Mrs. (Roberta Paul) Gordon,
      whom Mann had known since childhood.</p>
