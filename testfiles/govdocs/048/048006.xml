                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Tell me, Mr. Sollman, you were 21 and I assume at that time you were still living in Fort Branch?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>At that time I was living in Indianapolis.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>In Indianapolis. What made you decide to enlist, first of all?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I was about to be drafted in the Army and I didn't want to go in the Army. I didn't want -- I didn't want to serve in the Army, and I was about to be drafted. And in fact, I was supposed to report to the draft board on Monday and I enlisted in the Navy on Saturday.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Were some of your friends doing the same thing at that time?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Not that I know of. Not that I know of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>But you were pretty confident in your own mind if you didn't enlist in the Navy you were going to probably be an infantryman in the Army, right?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Do you recall where you went to sign up?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Indianapolis.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>And do you remember where it was or anything?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>At the Navy center. That's all I know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Did they then ship you out on a bus or a train to some larger facility?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. They shipped me to Great Lakes for boot camp.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What was boot camp like for you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, it was pretty good. I enjoyed all my experiences at that time. I had been at boot camp for a month.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Was boot camp pretty rigorous for you or was it fairly easy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Not me. It was fairly easy. I was in good shape physically and what they went through I enjoyed doing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>After boot camp where were you sent to sign up?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I was sent to Philadelphia, Philadelphia Navy yard, and assigned to the USS Santa Fe at Camden Navy yard.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>And at that time did you have some specialized training?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I did. I went to radar school in Philadelphia Navy yard.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What was your first assignment as a radio man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Radar.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Pardon me. That's a radar man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>First assignment was aboard the USS Santa Fe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>And where was the ship docked?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>The ship was docked in the Philadelphia Navy yard ready to be launched actually or be commissioned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>It was a brand new ship?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>A brand new ship.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Roughly how many men might have been on a ship like that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, when they were full of men, I think it was around 1200.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What was that ship really designed for? What kind of action?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>A light cruiser. It was a light cruiser. Assigned to escort the aircraft carrier and shore bombardment and most of the time we escorted carriers while we were in action, but we did a lot of shore bombardments too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Uh-huh.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What was -- I suppose there was a period of time where since it was a brand new ship and you were virtually its first crew there was a period of I guess of shake down?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>There was shake down. It was in the Atlantic Ocean and came back into harbor, went around through the canal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>When you were going across the Atlantic, was there any concerns about subs or did you have to zigzag any to elude anything at that time?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I can't remember. Not too much. We were just offshore, not very far.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I see.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>And we were just offshore. We were inland in our shake down cruise in Chesapeake Bay, most of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What was the ship's real first assignment, do you recall?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Bomb -- I believe that the bombardment we got.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Why don't you just tell me some of the information that's on there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Bombardment of Attu and bombardment of Kiska, occupation of Kiska in July and air strikes. Then we went for air strikes in Kerala and Macon Islands and air strikes and bombardment in Blake Island. That's the one I can recall.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Tell me, what was that like? Was that your first real episode in actual combat?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Tell me about that. What was that like?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Well --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Was that I guess the first combat episode for everybody on the crew, right?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, Attu was and Amchitka and Kiska, and we bombarded there and actually we didn't meet any resistance at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>But some of the ships and the fleet opened up fire and that was the battle of the Sitkin pit, they call it, where they picked up something on the radar and all the ships opened fire on it except the radar men on our ship, and we got a commendation for that, because from the O admiral, because we didn't open fire, and all the other ships did. And so it was called the battle of the Sitkin pit. It was a pit off of some island which really wasn't the enemy ship at all. Then later on, when they landed on Kiska and there weren't any Japs there, they thought maybe that was the night that the Japs sneaked out; you know, they didn't know, they weren't sure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Now, what was it like being on a ship the size of your ship and feeling like you were going to be engaging in some kind of combat situation? Did you guys feel like you were ready for it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, we sure did. We had good training up to that time and we were ready for it really. Look at all -- all these piles and we never got hit once.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>That's amazing. That's quite a record.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>That's why they called it the Lucky Lady.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>The ship was called the Lucky Lady?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Uh-huh, yeah. We lost one life, a Marine, a Marine died from burns; a suicide plane crashed right on our bow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>On your ship?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Uh-huh, and the burning gasoline from that suicide plane flew up.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Can you tell me where you were when that happened.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I was up in the -- where is that picture at? Here's the picture. My battle station was right up in that gun director, about six inches, see that radar sticking up there, and my battle station was right below that, right in there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>And where would the plane have struck?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>In the aft end right back there where the Marine, see this back, see that crane back there, that's how they lowered the planes, in the water, off of our ship, the search planes. We had two search planes aboard our ship and they'd lower them with this crane in the water and they'd take off.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>When that Kamikaze hit, was it at nighttime?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>So it was completely unexpected?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>My gosh. What did you all think when that happened? Did you think there were more coming?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. You're not kidding. It scared the hell out of us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I bet it did. What happened on the ship then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Of course we went -- we were at the battle station when it happened.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, you were?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. The Marine was back on that 20 millimeter gun back there. He was back on that 20 millimeter gun. The Marine is the man the 20 millimeter around, 20 millimeter up there and a couple alongside here (indicating) and the Marines man those.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I just can't imagine what those Kamikaze attacks must have been like.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>It makes me think when the Franklin, when Franklin got hit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Well, actually I interviewed a man from Evansville who was on the Franklin. I'll have to look in my calendar.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>What was that guy's name here? There was a write up in the paper about him. I think he died. I think he died about a year ago.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>No, it was not him. I'll have to look.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>We're going to talk now about the attack on the Franklin and where Mr. Sollman's ship was in relation to that. Tell us that story.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Of course we were -- as usual, we were in the circle around all the aircraft carriers protecting the aircraft carriers, the light cruisers -- see, the way they formed a circle, the destroyers were on the very outside, the light cruisers were next, then the hay day cruisers were next inside and then came the aircraft carriers. The aircraft carriers were protected by all of these other ships, and we were then in second circle around the carriers from the outside, second from the outside, and the destroyers were beyond us, and then the battle ships, the heyday cruisers, they were inside us, and of course whenever the Franklin got hit, they wanted us to stay there and pick up survivors. And we picked up a whole bunch of survivors and we tied up alongside the Franklin.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Were there a lot of men that ended up in the water?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, a whole lot of men. A whole lot of men. In fact, we picked up quite a few and they said -- and we took them back to Pearl Harbor and they said that skipper on the Franklin was going to court-martial every one of them for abandoning ship and heck, they got blowed off of the ship actually. The command -- captain, he was a captain, I guess, in the Navy, he was a mean son of a gun.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>You just sent a chill down my spine because that's exactly what that man from Evansville told me, that he faced a court-martial, he was going to face court-martial for ending up in the water.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>On a desertion charge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, yeah. They got knocked off a ship and we picked a lot of them up. We picked one guy up that was peculiar, one guy couldn't swim a lick. He was blowed in the water and we -- they shut the lines, you know, ropes that they shoot with a gun, it was the way we called it, the Navy wouldn't let you call it rope; they shot these lines out and they shot one out and fell right across this and he grabbed a hold of it and we pulled him in and he couldn't swim a lick, couldn't swim a lick and we saved his life, you know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I'm sure that the smoke had to have been absolutely incredible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. The smoke was real bad, heyday smoke came from the ship, you know. This guy from Evansville, that was a boy, he said he climbed out on a crane and he said he fell off and fell aboard the Santa Fe, fell off of this crane, we were pulled alongside and he fell off. They said the guy from the Franklin, they said he was I'd say an SB and he was in fact -- we had our aircraft, we had our catapult, which would catapult the ships out, you know, off of our ship, we had catapults right here on the end, end of the ship back here and see that plane sitting there on the catapult, we catapult them out and then they searched for the enemy and it went after they go out and they send messages back to our ship and they -- the catapults were trained out and captain Gary, he was the captain of the Franklin, he hollered down along the ship, he said, sailors, train them catapults in, because they were hitting his gun directors, you know. It was tearing his ship up and ours too and guys, sailors aboard our ship hollered back up at him, go to hell, you son of a bitch. But they wanted to tear up our ship, so we'd get to go back to the Navy yard and get it fixed. We had been out there for 220,000 miles. We hadn't been back to the States and they wanted to go back to the States.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think on the Franklin that there could have been anything done under the circumstances to have prevented some of the loss of life or was it just a situation that happened too fast?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>It just happened fast. I couldn't tell whether he cost any lives or not, but the water was full up.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I've heard that there was something like 700 casualties or 700 deaths.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. The water was full of guys. We picked up I believe 300, something like that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>My goodness.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Out of the water. Fished them out of the water.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Good. I'm sure that's something you'll absolutely never ever forget.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Goodness.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I know that the man from Evansville that I spoke to on the Franklin said of course he said that he just remembers, you know, that all of those men were buried at sea, just a very moving period, I'm sure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Can you write that name down.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I'll write that down for you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Okay. I never did go see what you call it there, I kind of knew him; I kind of knew him offhand a little bit, but I wanted to go see him, it's too late. She saw the obituary in the paper.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Well, was the episode on the Franklin that you were so close to, was that probably the worst thing that happened to you while you were in the Navy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Probably. Probably. Probably that was.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>That's a horrible thing to have to have gone through.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>We didn't get too close to bombardment. We got missed several times. In fact, I had a buddy, his battle station, mine was up here (indicating) and this gun director back here (indicating) and he was in between the aft. He was a spotter and he got ducked between those instruments back there. One time I said, Joe, what's the matter with you anyway, you scared? He said, damn right. He said, that dang projector went right between the stacks here. That was at Wake Island when that happened, when Wake Island was still occupied. That was one of the first ones we were in was Wake.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>You were at Iwa Jima too, honey.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>You might say. I don't think we was anchored, might have been anchored but right off Iwa Jima. We bombarded all, all the Marines that went in there went right by us into the landings, the Iwa Jima, a lot of them were the first couple of weeks didn't even make it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Iwa Jima was really quite mountainous, wasn't it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, yeah. There is a big mountain just on one end.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I've heard that it was --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>That's where they raised that flag, you know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Wasn't it very hard to have known where the enemy was?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. That mountain was full of caves and the Japs were in those caves and when our troops landed the Japs were sitting right up there and we was sitting ducks, see, finally they went up and burned them out with flame thrower out of those caves and you have to wonder why -- why they couldn't use poison gas and gas to put them to sleep right in there, rather than seem to me like burning them out would be just as painful as putting them to sleep but they had rules, government seemed silly to have rules for a war. But I often wondered why they didn't use poison gas. I guess they were afraid it would rebound and kill some of our own troops. I don't know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>That sounds like that could have happened.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Possibly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>You know, they had agreement after World War II -- World War I not to use poisonous gas, and they wouldn't use poisonous gas in those caves and they cost a lot, a lot of our lives where they could have put those Japs to sleep and saved the lives. We bombarded some of those islands they had concrete pill boxes, they called them, and all projectiles couldn't hit them. They had them slamming and when they'd hit, they'd glance off. See, they couldn't -- see, the Japs were smarter than us, not to make them square, you know. They had them slanted and when the United States ships hit, why the projectiles would just glance off, they wouldn't explode. They'd just glance off. They finally started using a lot of sensitive fumes on them, which caused them to explode easy, easier, you know.</p>

                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. See, here too tied alongside the Franklin.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>There is Franklin rescue there; we were tied alongside. Any minute you might say good-bye to everybody.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Where were you? Where was your ship at the time when you found out about the bombing at Hiroshima?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I got transferred off of the ship. We came back to the States, and I had 30 days leave at home and then I got an extension, because we weren't going back out for a while. I got an extension.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>So the ship actually came back?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. We got to come back home after this, we got to come back.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>After the Franklin?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. After the Franklin. This was at Okinawa, when the Franklin got hit there, and we got to come back home and the ship had a Navy yard and the ship went back out and I got transferred off of the ship at Pearl Harbor and was sent to radar school and I was supposed to be assigned to a picket boat. First I was -- first I was supposed to be assigned to the Indianapolis, and the Indianapolis came in there so quick and left so quick, they was in such a big hurry, I missed it, and --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Good thing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. Yeah. They lost them all almost, almost every one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>You could have been on that ship?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I could have been on that. That's how lucky I was during the war. I could have been aboard and then I didn't get assigned to it, then they assigned me to a destroyer escort and it was supposed to do picket boat duty way out by itself loaded with radar and no protection of any kind or anything, and we went out between Iwo and Japan and I stayed there three months and I got discharged off of that ship. Put me on LSD to go back to Pearl Harbor, took me a month to get back there, and here I was waiting to get discharged.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. Where were you when you heard about the bombing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I was at -- as I started to tell you, I was transferred off the ship and I was at Pearl Harbor and the whole harbor lit up.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Did you think that at that time you were all going to be heading to Japan?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>That's really what was going to happen?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. That's really the invasion of Japan, yeah, and when that was the end of it, why they turned on all the search lights, everything in Pearl Harbor. The whole harbor was lit up. Signs was going, the whole harbor was lit up, said the Japs are quit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Everybody felt when they heard about the bombing that was going to be it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Wow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>What did you think when you finally heard the news of the surrender?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>That was great. That was the greatest thing I ever heard. I knew I was going back home.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>How soon did you get to go home?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Well, it took me a long time to get back to Great Lakes. I got there New Year's Eve and got discharged.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>It took you a few months, didn't you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. Yeah. It took me -- that LSD bobbled around like a cork in the Pacific until they got us back to Pearl Harbor. Then we got a big ship at Pearl to the States. They sent me to San Francisco Navy yard and I was there a good while before they put me on a train and sent me to Great Lakes to discharge, and I got there the latter part of December.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>So what was it like to go back home?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, it was great. It was great to get back home, and then I fooled around celebrating until February and in February I started back into school, college.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Did you use your GI bill?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I used it. I used all -- I used all but one year. I had one year left. I went right through the summertime, college. I graduated in three years, and I had one GI -- one year GI bill left and I started to use part of it for my master's degree, and I got -- I used part of it then for my master's degree at Vanderbilt, and then I was going to go ahead and get some more, maybe my doctor's degree at Indiana or more advanced school anyway at Indiana University and I got married and I quit that. That's it. And it wasn't her. It was my first wife. She passed away and this is my second wife. I don't know that you ever met her or not. Did you? Have you met her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Not officially.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Okay. That's my second wife, Frances. We've been married 15 years.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Old classmates.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>We were old classmates and went to our 40th reunion, high school, and got acquainted, and it took me five years to find her again and get married.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Slow but deliberate, huh? That's nice. That's a great story.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Well, tell me, just in conclusion, how do you feel about your time in the military and what the U.S. was able to do during that time, during World War II? It was such a huge endeavor.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I'm so proud.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>We really don't talk about it very much.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>I think it's a tremendous thing to be so proud of. Because you changed everything for everybody else, decades to come.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>He has two boys and I don't even know hardly anything about them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I shouldn't be crying like this.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>He is diabetic.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>She makes fun of me when I cry.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>Then I cry too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>But some of these people that bitch and don't have anything to bitch about.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Herman Sollman</speaker>
                  <p>I always had a flag in my classroom at school when I was teaching, I always had that flag there and one day I come to class and the flag was gone and I told the class, I said, I gave three years of my life so that thing can hang there. I said, I'm going to leave this classroom, five minutes, and I'm going to come back and if that flag isn't there, somebody is going to be in trouble, and I left the classroom, come back and the flag was there and I just went on with my classroom, with my class, you know, that they tried to play tricks on teachers, you know; when they messed around with that flag, that was it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Larry Ordner</speaker>
                  <p>That's a great story. Thanks a lot. You did a wonderful job.</p>
