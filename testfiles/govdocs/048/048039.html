Following in the footsteps of the famous April 1920 'Great Debate' 
between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,
this series of debates among leaders in the astronomical community
highlight major quests in astronomy and astrophysics 
in an open forum at the turn of the millennium. <p>
 
Each debate has been held in April in the Baird auditorium of
the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, the site of the original
Shapley - Curtis debate.
This delightful auditorium's general appearance
has remained remarkably constant since the 1920s.
Its large, central ceiling electrolier is the debate series logo used above. 
<p>
 
These pages feature background information, educational material,
and published proceedings for each debate.  Information on future debates
will also be made available here.
