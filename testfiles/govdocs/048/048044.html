<U>NEW HANDBOOK PROVISIONS</U>
<A HREF="#N_*_"><SUP>*</SUP></A>
<OL>
<LI><U>General Principle Governing Expenses</U>
<P>
A standing trustee may make necessary expenditures from fiduciary
expense funds to administer the estates efficiently and effectively.
Expenses must be reasonable, actual, and necessary; relate to the
duties of the trustee; and be supported by proper documentation.
The United States Trustees encourage each trustee to determine the
most cost-effective method of running the trust operation consistent
with fiduciary standards.</P></STRONG>
<STRONG>
<LI><U>Major Expenditures</U>

<P>A standing trustee shall obtain a minimum of three price quotes, if
available, when requesting the United States Trustee to approve a
purchase of $2,500 or more or a lease of personal property that
exceeds $5,000 over the term of the lease.</P></LI></STRONG></OL>
<P><STRONG>
COMMENT:</STRONG>This provision is designed to encourage competition among vendors for
furnishings, computer equipment, and other major expense items.  It also formalizes the
practice of most standing trustees to explore the market before making a decision.  It is
recognized that the lowest bid may not necessarily be the most cost-effective choice for
a standing trustee's needs.  If fewer than three vendors are able to provide the product
needed, a standing trustee should demonstrate to the United States Trustee's
satisfaction all efforts to find other sources.   This provision modifies the current
requirement for a standing trustee to obtain United States Trustee approval for
purchases in excess of $1,000 by raising the threshold amount to $2,500 and adding the 
requirement of three price quotes.  See <EM>Handbook for Chapter 13 Standing Trustees</EM>
(Sept. 1991) at 6 and <EM>Handbook for Chapter 12 Trustees</EM> (June 1992) at 8.</P>
<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="3"><U>Rent and Utilities</U>
<P>
Office rent for the standing trustee should be reasonable and at or
below the local market rate for comparable space.  When moving into
new office space or renewing a lease, a standing trustee is to obtain
rental rates for comparable space to ensure that the contract rate is at
or below market.  The amount of leased space also must be reasonable
and necessary to carry out the trustee's duties.</STRONG></P></LI></OL>
<P><STRONG>
COMMENT:</STRONG>  Both the rate and the amount of space being leased are important factors
in evaluating the overall reasonableness of a lease.  In 1995, standing trustees were
providing 166 to 1,600 square feet per employee (including conference rooms, libraries,
and common areas).   While it is difficult to formulate a rule of thumb that applies to all
situations and recognizing that there may be variations, it is suggested that standing
trustees rent 250 to 350 square feet per employee, excluding space for sec. 341 meeting
rooms and off-site storage.  See <EM>Handbook for Chapter 13 Standing Trustees</EM> 
(Sept. 1991) at 6, 14, and 17 and <EM>Handbook for Chapter 12 Trustees</EM> 
(June 1992) at 17.</P>
<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="4"><U>Facilities and Equipment</U>
<P>
A standing trustee shall not lease or sublease to another entity any
office space or equipment which has been paid for or acquired with
fiduciary expense funds.</P>

<P>If a standing trustee has acquired excess space or equipment that is
not necessary for the administration of the cases, the standing trustee
should attempt to sell it, to renegotiate the lease, or otherwise to
dispose of it in a commercially reasonable manner.</P>

<P>This provision does not prevent a standing trustee from assisting
another standing trustee with the approval of the United States Trustee. 
</P></STRONG>
<STRONG>
<LI><U>Employee Salaries</U>

<P>
A standing trustee shall develop salary ranges for each employee
position and state whether the position is exempt or non-exempt for
purposes of overtime.  The salary ranges provide the standing trustee
and the employee with an established and appropriate entry level and
maximum level of compensation for each position.  These ranges
should be similar to the range in the local market for a position
requiring the same or similar skills for the same number of hours.  In
addition to the job descriptions currently required to be submitted to
the United States Trustee, a standing trustee is to submit a proposed
pay chart to the United States Trustee upon request.</P></STRONG>
<P></LI></OL>
<STRONG>COMMENT</STRONG>:  
This provision supplements the provision in the <EM>Handbook for Chapter 13
Standing Trustees</EM> (Sept. 1991) at 13 and the <EM>Handbook for Chapter 12 
Standing Trustees</EM> (June 1992) at 16 that requires a standing trustee to 
establish position descriptions for each employee.  The salary ranges are 
designed to complement the position descriptions.<BR>
<STRONG>IMPLEMENTATION</STRONG>:
This provision will be fully implemented by October&nbsp;1, 1998.</P>

<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="6"><U>Employee Benefits</U>

<P>A standing trustee is to develop an overall employee benefits package
comparable to that provided in the community in which a standing
trustee's operation is located for similarly sized service businesses (i.e.
number of employees).  A standing trustee should consider common
cost-cutting measures such as co-payments for health insurance and
HMO's and shall demonstrate in writing, to the satisfaction of the
United States Trustee, that the total compensation and benefit package
provided to employees is commensurate with compensation and
benefit packages provided for the same or similar positions in
similarly-sized service businesses in the community. The standing
trustee shall provide to the United States Trustee a listing of each
benefit and the cost to the fiduciary expense fund of each benefit.</P></STRONG></LI></OL>

<P><STRONG>COMMENT</STRONG>:  
This provision allows a standing trustee to provide employees a total
compensation and benefit package that is in keeping with the comparable market in the
location in which the standing trustee operates.  It enhances a standing trustee's and the
employees' discretion in selecting a benefit plan with optimal benefits for meeting 
employees' needs while keeping trust costs in line with other non-manufacturing
businesses in the community in which a standing trustee operates.<BR>
<STRONG>IMPLEMENTATION</STRONG>:
This provision will be fully implemented by October&nbsp;1, 1998.</P>

<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="7"><U>Placement Fees/Temporary Help</U>
<P>
A standing trustee may hire temporary personnel if authorized by the
United States Trustee as part of the budget process; however, the use
of temporary personnel as a standard procedure for hiring new
permanent employees is not appropriate if it results in significant
placement charges and turnover.</P>
<LI><U>Travel</U>

<P>
Mileage reimbursement for use of a personal automobile for necessary
travel beyond the usual place of business is authorized at the rate
allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.  While a long-term lease or the
purchase of an automobile with fiduciary expense funds is not
authorized, short-term car rentals may be appropriate if cost effective. 
Reimbursement for meals is authorized if the official travel causes a
standing trustee or employee to be away from the office for more than
ten consecutive hours.  Reimbursement for lodging is authorized if a
trustee or employee travels more than 50 miles from the office or home
and an overnight stay is necessary.</P>

<LI><U>Payment or Reimbursement for Extraordinary Legal Expenses</U>
<P>
If a standing trustee is sued (or threatened to be sued) for certain
conduct and (1) the conduct complained of appears to have been
performed within the scope of the standing trustee's official duties and
(2) the United States Trustee determines the use of estate funds to
defend the allegations under the facts presented is a necessary
expense incurred in the administration of the standing trustee's cases,
the United States Trustee may authorize the standing trustee to use
fiduciary expense funds to pay for extraordinary legal expenses.   </P>
<P>
The standing trustee is to submit a written request to the United States
Trustee for payment or reimbursement of the legal expenses at the
earliest practicable time.  Disclosure in the standing trustee's annual
budget is not considered a written request for approval for purposes
of this provision.  The written request should contain the following
information:  (1) a detailed summary of the facts surrounding the
challenged conduct, (2) the amount(s), terms and conditions of any
retention agreement for counsel, (3) copies of all relevant documents,
including letters, pleadings, and other information the United States
Trustee deems appropriate, and (4) a budget describing the legal
services to be performed with the anticipated costs and charges of the
services.  </P>
<P>
The request for payment of the legal expenses will be re-evaluated each
quarter and conditioned upon the review by the United States Trustee
of a written quarterly status report from the standing trustee, together
with additional documents the United States Trustee may request,
showing that the legal expenses continue to be actual and necessary
expenses of the trust operation.</P>
<P>
Legal expenses incurred by a standing trustee in connection with
actions initiated by or against the standing trustee by or against the
United States Trustee are personal to the trustee and do not constitute
actual and necessary expenses of administering a standing trustee's
cases.</P></LI></STRONG></OL>

<P><STRONG><U>COMMENT</U></STRONG>: 
Under the <EM>Handbook for Chapter 13 Standing Trustees</EM> (Sept. 1991) at 14
and the <EM>Handbook for Chapter 12 Standing Trustees</EM> (June 1992) at 18, 
a standing trustee may budget a sum of money to pay for anticipated services rendered 
by attorneys and other professionals in the regular course of administering cases as 
distinguished from services arising from the appointment of attorneys or other 
professionals under sec. 327. The handbooks require the United States Trustee's prior 
approval of any employment or retention of an attorney.  The revision requires more 
affirmative disclosure from a standing trustee to enable the United States Trustee to 
evaluate the reasonableness of a request for extraordinary legal expenses.</P>
<OL>
<STRONG>
<LI VALUE="10"><U>Training Expenses</U>
<P>Job-related training of standing trustees and their employees is
encouraged.  A standing trustee may use up to one percent of the fiscal
year operating expense fund or $5,000, whichever is greater, to provide
training for employees and the standing trustee.  A standing trustee
does not have to receive pre-approval for training expenditures so long
as they meet the following conditions:  1) all expenses associated with
the training (such as conference registration, textbooks, travel, meals,
lodging) are included in the training line item of the budget, 2) courses,
seminars, and training sessions for the standing trustee and employees
are directly related to the duties of the standing trustee or employee,
and 3) the expenses are reasonable and necessary.</P>
<P>
A standing trustee is to attach to the annual report for each fiscal year
a report listing each seminar, person attending, and cost.  Training
required by the United States Trustee is not included in the training
allowance.</P>
<P>
If a standing trustee deems it necessary to spend an amount in excess
of the training allowance, the United States Trustee may authorize an
additional amount upon a proper showing by the standing trustee.  For
example, a newly-appointed trustee (within the first three years of
appointment), especially one with new staff, may need more job-related
training than allowed by the allotment and should submit a training plan
with costs to the United States Trustee.</P></LI></STRONG></OL>

<P><STRONG>COMMENT</STRONG>:  
This provision provides a standing trustee with roughly $600 to $650
annually per person for training to enhance job skills.  It also allows the trustee 
discretion in choosing training.<BR>
<STRONG>IMPLEMENTATION</STRONG>:  
Effective October 1, 1997, for Chapter 13 standing trustees and January 1, 1998, 
for Chapter 12 standing trustees.</P>
<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="11">
<U>Additional Co-Trustee Operations Prohibited</U>

<P>United States Trustees will not approve the expenses to establish a
new co-trustee operation.</P></LI></STRONG></OL>

<STRONG>COMMENT:</STRONG>
The commingling of financial and operational systems does not allow the
United States Trustee to hold either standing trustee clearly accountable.  In the event of
financial or administrative deficiencies, because the conduct of each is indistinguishable
in a co-trustee arrangement, one trustee cannot serve as a back-up for the other.  In
addition, the cost of the second trustee is unnecessary because there is no operational
distinction between a co-trustee and a single trustee operation. The provision is
prospective only.  Co-trustee operations already in existence are not affected by the
provision.</P>

<OL><STRONG>
<LI VALUE="12"><U>Miscellaneous Expense Items</U>

<P>Items such as the following are not authorized expenditures: flowers,
alcohol, food, party supplies, gifts, dues or membership fees for
professional organizations, fines for parking or traffic violations, and
tax penalties (e.g., penalty for failing to pay employee taxes timely). </P></LI></STRONG></OL>

<P><STRONG>COMMENT</STRONG>
The <EM>Handbook for Chapter 13 Standing Trustees</EM> (Sept. 1991) at 15 and the
<EM>Handbook for Chapter 12 Standing Trustees</EM> (June 1992) at 18-19 prohibit the use of
fiduciary funds for licensing fees.  The addition of dues and membership fees as
unauthorized expenditures reinstates a prohibition in the "Guide to Judiciary Policies &amp;
Procedures Bankruptcy Manual" published  by the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts (January 17, 1983), Volume V-A.</P><p>
