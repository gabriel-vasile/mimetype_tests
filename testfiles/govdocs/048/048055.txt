[Changes to Senate rules since the last general revision in 
1979 are indicated by footnotes.
[The 1979 general revision of the rules was accomplished by the 
adoption of S. Res. 274 on Nov. 14, 1979, a resolution 
submitted by Mr. Robert C. Byrd for himself and Mr. Baker; the 
preparation of the proposed revision was pursuant to the 
adoption of S. Res. 156 on May 10, 1976, a resolution by Mr. 
Robert C. Byrd; the general revision of the rules set forth in 
S. Res. 274 was somewhat altered in form by the adoption of S. 
Res. 389 on Mar. 25, 1980, to consolidate and renumber certain 
standing rules of the Senate.
[For the origin of various changes in Senate procedure between 
1884 and 1979, as set forth in rules changes, adopted 
resolutions and Legislative Reorganization Acts, see the table 
on p. XVI of Riddick's Senate Procedure,1992 edition.]

election of a President pro tempore, the Acting President pro 
tempore or the Secretary of the Senate, or in his absence the 
Assistant Secretary, shall perform the duties of the Chair.
    3. The President pro tempore shall have the right to name 
in open Senate or, if absent, in writing, a Senator to perform 
the duties of the Chair, including the signing of duly enrolled 
bills and joint resolutions but such substitution shall not 
extend beyond an adjournment, except by unanimous consent; and 
the Senator so named shall have the right to name in open 
session, or, if absent, in writing, a Senator to perform the 
duties of the Chair, but not to extend beyond an adjournment, 
except by unanimous consent.

                                RULE II

presence of a quorum; and all questions and motions arising or 
made upon the presentation of such credentials shall be 
proceeded with until disposed of.
    2. The Secretary shall keep a record of the certificates of 
election and certificates of appointment of Senators by 
entering in a well-bound book kept for that purpose the date of 
the election or appointment, the name of the person elected or 
appointed, the date of the certificate, the name of the 
governor and the secretary of state signing and counter-signing 
the same, and the State from which such Senator is elected or 
appointed.
    3. The Secretary of the Senate shall send copies of the

and shall be considered approved to date.
    (c) The proceedings of the Senate shall be briefly and 
accurately stated on the Journal. Messages of the President in

    (d) The legislative, the executive, the confidential

part thereof, shall be in order, except on one day's notice in 
writing, specifying precisely the rule or part proposed to be 
suspended, modified, or amended, and the purpose thereof. Any 
rule may be suspended without notice by the unanimous consent 
of the Senate, except as otherwise provided by the rules.
    2. The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress 
to the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in 
these rules.

Secretary to call the roll and shall announce the result, and 
these proceedings shall be without debate.
    4. Whenever upon such roll call it shall be ascertained 
that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators 
present may direct the Sergeant at Arms to request, and, when 
necessary, to compel the attendance of the absent Senators, 
which order shall be determined without debate; and pending its 
execution, and until a quorum shall be present, no debate nor 
motion, except to adjourn, or to recess pursuant to a previous 
order entered by unanimous consent, shall be in order.

                                RULE VII


                            morning business


    1. On each legislative day after the Journal is read, the 
Presiding Officer on demand of any Senator shall lay before the 
Senate messages from the President, reports and communications 
from the heads of Departments, and other communications 
addressed to the Senate, and such bills, joint resolutions, and 
other messages from the House of Representatives as may remain 
upon his table from any previous day's session undisposed of. 
The Presiding Officer on demand of any Senator shall then call 
for, in the following order:
    The presentation of petitions and memorials.
    Reports of committees.
    The introduction of bills and joint resolutions.
    The submission of other resolutions.
All of which shall be received and disposed of in such order, 
unless unanimous consent shall be otherwise given, with newly 
offered resolutions being called for before resolutions coming 
over from a previous legislative day are laid before the 
Senate.
    2. Until the morning business shall have been concluded, 
and so announced from the Chair, or until one hour after the 
Senate convenes at the beginning of a new legislative day, no 
motion to proceed to the consideration of any bill, resolution, 
report of a committee, or other subject upon the Calendar shall 
be entertained by the Presiding Officer, unless by unanimous 
consent: Provided, however, That on Mondays which are the 
beginning of a legislative day the Calendar shall be called 
under rule VIII, and until two hours after the Senate convenes 
no motion shall be entertained to proceed to the consideration 
of any bill, resolution, or other subject upon the Calendar 
except the motion to continue the consideration of a bill, 
resolution, or other subject against objection as provided in 
rule VIII, or until the call of the Calendar has been 
completed.
    3. The Presiding Officer may at any time lay, and it shall 
be in order at any time for a Senator to move to lay, before 
the Senate, any bill or other matter sent to the Senate by the 
President or the House of Representatives for appropriate 
action allowed under the rules and any question pending at that 
time shall be suspended for this purpose. Any motion so made 
shall be determined without debate.
    4. Petitions or memorials shall be referred, without 
debate, to the appropriate committee according to subject 
matter on the same basis as bills and resolutions, if signed by 
the petitioner or memorialist. A question of receiving or 
reference may be raised and determined without debate. But no 
petition or memorial or other paper signed by citizens or 
subjects of a foreign power shall be received, unless the same 
be transmitted to the Senate by the President.
    5. Only a brief statement of the contents of petitions and 
memorials shall be printed in the Congressional Record; and no 
other portion of any petition or memorial shall be printed in 
the Record unless specifically so ordered by vote of the 
Senate, as provided for in paragraph 4 of rule XI, in which 
case the order shall be deemed to apply to the body of the 
petition or memorial only; and names attached to the petition 
or memorial shall not be printed unless specially ordered, 
except that petitions and memorials from the legislatures or 
conventions, lawfully called, of the respective States, 
Territories, and insular possessions shall be printed in full 
in the Record whenever presented.
    6. Senators having petitions, memorials, bills, or 
resolutions to present after the morning hour may deliver them 
in the absence of objection to the Presiding Officer's desk, 
endorsing upon them their names, and with the approval of the 
Presiding Officer, they shall be entered on the Journal with 
the names of the Senators presenting them and in the absence of 
objection shall be considered as having been read twice and 
referred to the appropriate committees, and a transcript of 
such entries shall be furnished to the official reporter of 
debates for publication in the Congressional Record, under the 
direction of the Secretary of the Senate.

                               RULE VIII


                           order of business


    1. At the conclusion of the morning business at the 
beginning of a new legislative day, unless upon motion the 
Senate shall at any time otherwise order, the Senate shall 
proceed to the consideration of the Calendar of Bills and 
Resolutions, and shall continue such consideration until 2 
hours after the Senate convenes on such day (the end of the 
morning hour); and bills and resolutions that are not objected 
to shall be taken up in their order, and each Senator shall be 
entitled to speak once and for five minutes only upon any 
question; and an objection may be interposed at any stage of 
the proceedings, but upon motion the Senate may continue such 
consideration; and this order shall commence immediately after 
the call for ``other resolutions'', or after disposition of 
resolutions coming ``over under the rule'', and shall take 
precedence of the unfinished business and other special orders. 
But if the Senate shall proceed on motion with the 
consideration of any matter notwithstanding an objection, the 
foregoing provisions touching debate shall not apply.
    2. All motions made during the first two hours of a new 
legislative day to proceed to the consideration of any matter 
shall be determined without debate, except motions to proceed 
to the consideration of any motion, resolution, or proposal to 
change any of the Standing Rules of the Senate shall be 
debatable. Motions made after the first two hours of a new 
legislative day to proceed to the consideration of bills and 
resolutions are debatable.

                                RULE IX

    1. Messages from the President of the United States or from 
the House of Representatives may be received at any stage of 
proceedings, except while the Senate is voting or ascertaining 
the presence of a quorum, or while the Journal is being read, 
or while a question of order or a motion to adjourn is pending.
    2. Messages shall be sent to the House of Representatives 
by the Secretary, who shall previously certify the 
determination of the Senate upon all bills, joint resolutions,

States all resolutions and other communications which may be

                                 RULE X


                             special orders


    1. Any subject may, by a vote of two-thirds of the Senators 
present, be made a special order of business for consideration 
and when the time so fixed for its consideration arrives the 
Presiding Officer shall lay it before the Senate, unless there 
be unfinished business in which case it takes its place on the 
Calendar of Special Orders in the order of time at which it was 
made special, to be considered in that order when there is no 
unfinished business.
    2. All motions to change such order, or to proceed to the 
consideration of other business, shall be decided without 
debate.

                                RULE XI


        papers--withdrawal, printing, reading of, and reference

except original treaties finally acted upon, shall be withdrawn 
from its files except by order of the Senate.
    2. The Secretary of the Senate shall obtain at the close of 
each Congress all the noncurrent records of the Senate and of 
each Senate committee and transfer them to the National 
Archives and Records Administration for preservation, subject 
to the orders of the Senate.
    3. When the reading of a paper is called for, and objected 
to, it shall be determined by a vote of the Senate, without 
debate.
    4. Every motion or resolution to print documents, reports, 
and other matter transmitted by the executive departments, or 
to print memorials, petitions, accompanying documents, or any 
other paper, except bills of the Senate or House of 
Representatives, resolutions submitted by a Senator, 
communications from the legislatures or conventions, lawfully 
called, of the respective States, shall, unless the Senate 
otherwise order, be referred to the Committee on Rules and 
Administration. When a motion is made to commit with 
instructions, it shall be in order to add thereto a motion to 
print.
    5. Motions or resolutions to print additional numbers shall 
also be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration; 
and when the committee shall report favorably, the report shall 
be accompanied by an estimate of the probable cost thereof; and 
when the cost of printing such additional numbers shall exceed 
the sum established by law, the concurrence of the House of 
Representatives shall be necessary for an order to print the 
same.
    6. Every bill and joint resolution introduced or reported 
from a committee, and all bills and joint resolutions received 
from the House of Representatives, and all reports of 
committees, shall be printed, unless, for the dispatch of the 
business of the Senate, such printing may be dispensed with.

                                RULE XII


                            voting procedure


    1. When the yeas and nays are ordered, the names of 
Senators shall be called alphabetically; and each Senator 
shall, without debate, declare his assent or dissent to the 
question, unless excused by the Senate; and no Senator shall be 
permitted to vote after the decision shall have been announced 
by the Presiding Officer, but may for sufficient reasons, with 
unanimous consent, change or withdraw his vote. No motion to 
suspend this rule shall be in order, nor shall the Presiding 
Officer entertain any request to suspend it by unanimous 
consent.
    2. When a Senator declines to vote on call of his name, he 
shall be required to assign his reasons therefor, and having 
assigned them, the Presiding Officer shall submit the question 
to the Senate: ``Shall the Senator for the reasons assigned by 
him, be excused from voting?'' which shall be decided without 
debate; and these proceedings shall be had after the rollcall 
and before the result is announced; and any further proceedings 
in reference thereto shall be after such announcement.
    3. A Member, notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
rule, may decline to vote, in committee or on the floor, on any 
matter when he believes that his voting on such a matter would 
be a conflict of interest.
    4. No request by a Senator for unanimous consent for the 
taking of a final vote on a specified date upon the passage of 
a bill or joint resolution shall be submitted to the Senate for 
agreement thereto until after a quorum call ordered for the 
purpose by the Presiding Officer, it shall be disclosed that a 
quorum of the Senate is present; and when a unanimous consent 
is thus given the same shall operate as the order of the 
Senate, but any unanimous consent may be revoked by another 
unanimous consent granted in the manner prescribed above upon 
one day's notice.

                               RULE XIII


                            reconsideration


    1. When a question has been decided by the Senate, any 
Senator voting with the prevailing side or who has not voted 
may, on the same day or on either of the next two days of 
actual session thereafter, move a reconsideration; and if the 
Senate shall refuse to reconsider such a motion entered, or if 
such a motion is withdrawn by leave of the Senate, or if upon 
reconsideration the Senate shall affirm its first decision, no 
further motion to reconsider shall be in order unless by 
unanimous consent. Every motion to reconsider shall be decided 
by a majority vote, and may be laid on the table without 
affecting the question in reference to which the same is made, 
which shall be a final disposition of the motion.
    2. When a bill, resolution, report, amendment, order, or 
message, upon which a vote has been taken, shall have gone out 
of the possession of the Senate and been communicated to the 
House of Representatives, the motion to reconsider shall be 
accompanied by a motion to request the House to return the 
same; which last motion shall be acted upon immediately, and 
without debate, and if determined in the negative shall be a 
final disposition of the motion to reconsider.

                                RULE XIV


      bills, joint resolutions, resolutions, and preambles thereto


    1. Whenever a bill or joint resolution shall be offered, 
its introduction shall, if objected to, be postponed for one 
day.
    2. Every bill and joint resolution shall receive three 
readings previous to its passage which readings on demand of 
any Senator shall be on three different legislative days, and 
the Presiding Officer shall give notice at each reading whether 
it be the first, second, or third: Provided, That each reading 
may be by title only, unless the Senate in any case shall 
otherwise order.
    3. No bill or joint resolution shall be committed or 
amended until it shall have been twice read, after which it may 
be referred to a committee; bills and joint resolutions 
introduced on leave, and bills and joint resolutions from the 
House of Representatives, shall be read once, and may be read 
twice, if not objected to, on the same day for reference, but 
shall not be considered on that day nor debated, except for 
reference, unless by unanimous consent.
    4. Every bill and joint resolution reported from a 
committee, not having previously been read, shall be read once, 
and twice, if not objected to, on the same day, and placed on 
the Calendar in the order in which the same may be reported; 
and every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave, and 
every bill and joint resolution of the House of Representatives 
which shall have received a first and second reading without 
being referred to a committee, shall, if objection be made to 
further proceeding thereon, be placed on the Calendar.
    5. All bills, amendments, and joint resolutions shall be 
examined under the supervision of the Secretary of the Senate 
before they go out of the possession of the Senate, and all 
bills and joint resolutions which shall have passed both Houses 
shall be examined under the supervision of the Secretary of the 
Senate, to see that the same are correctly enrolled, and, when 
signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the 
Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall forthwith present the 
same, when they shall have originated in the Senate, to the 
President of the United States and report the fact and date of 
such presentation to the Senate.
    6. All other resolutions shall lie over one day for 
consideration, if not referred, unless by unanimous consent the 
Senate shall otherwise direct. When objection is heard to the 
immediate consideration of a resolution or motion when it is 
submitted, it shall be placed on the Calendar under the heading 
of ``Resolutions and Motions over, under the Rule,'' to be laid 
before the Senate on the next legislative day when there is no 
further morning business but before the close of morning 
business and before the termination of the morning hour.
    7. When a bill or joint resolution shall have been ordered 
to be read a third time, it shall not be in order to propose 
amendments, unless by unanimous consent, but it shall be in 
order at any time before the passage of any bill or resolution 
to move its commitment; and when the bill or resolution shall 
again be reported from the committee it shall be placed on the 
Calendar.
    8. When a bill or resolution is accompanied by a preamble, 
the question shall first be put on the bill or resolution and 
then on the preamble, which may be withdrawn by a mover before 
an amendment of the same, or ordering of the yeas and nays; or 
it may be laid on the table without prejudice to the bill or 
resolution, and shall be a final disposition of such preamble.
    9. Whenever a private bill, except a bill for a pension, is 
under consideration, it shall be in order to move the adoption 
of a resolution to refer the bill to the Chief Commissioner of 
the Court of Claims for a report in conformity with section 
2509 of title 28, United States Code.
    10. No private bill or resolution (including so-called 
omnibus claims or pension bills), and no amendment to any bill 
or resolution, authorizing or directing (1) the payment of 
money for property damages, personal injuries, or death, for 
which a claim may be filed under chapter 171 of title 28, 
United States Code, or for a pension (other than to carry out a 
provision of law or treaty stipulation); (2) the construction 
of a bridge across a navigable stream; or (3) the correction of 
a military or naval record, shall be received or considered.

                                RULE XV


                         amendments and motions


    1. All motions and amendments shall be reduced to writing, 
if desired by the Presiding Officer or by any Senator, and 
shall be read before the same shall be debated.
    2. Any motion, amendment, or resolution may be withdrawn or 
modified by the mover at any time before a decision, amendment, 
or ordering of the yeas and nays, except a motion to 
reconsider, which shall not be withdrawn without leave.
    3. If the question in debate contains several propositions, 
any Senator may have the same divided, except a motion to 
strike out and insert, which shall not be divided; but the 
rejection of a motion to strike out and insert one proposition 
shall not prevent a motion to strike out and insert a different 
proposition; nor shall it prevent a motion simply to strike 
out; nor shall the rejection of a motion to strike out prevent 
a motion to strike out and insert. But pending a motion to 
strike out and insert, the part to be stricken out and the part 
to be inserted shall each be regarded for the purpose of 
amendment as a question, and motions to amend the part to be 
stricken out shall have precedence.
    4. When an amendment proposed to any pending measure is 
laid on the table, it shall not carry with it, or prejudice, 
such measure.
    5. It shall not be in order to consider any proposed 
committee amendment (other than a technical, clerical, or 
conforming amendment) which contains any significant matter not 
within the jurisdiction of the committee proposing such 
amendment.

                                RULE XVI


     appropriations and amendments to general appropriations bills


    1. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendments 
shall be received to any general appropriation bill the effect 
of which will be to increase an appropriation already contained 
in the bill, or to add a new item of appropriation, unless it 
be made to carry out the provisions of some existing law, or 
treaty stipulation, or act or resolution previously passed by 
the Senate during that session; or unless the same be moved by 
direction of the Committee on Appropriations or of a committee 
of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction of the subject 
matter, or proposed in pursuance of an estimate submitted in 
accordance with law.
    2. The Committee on Appropriations shall not report an 
appropriation bill containing amendments to such bill proposing 
new or general legislation or any restriction on the 
expenditure of the funds appropriated which proposes a 
limitation not authorized by law if such restriction is to take 
effect or cease to be effective upon the happening of a 
contingency, and if an appropriation bill is reported to the 
Senate containing amendments to such bill proposing new or 
general legislation or any such restriction, a point of order 
may be made against the bill, and if the point is sustained, 
the bill shall be recommitted to the Committee on 
Appropriations.
    3. All amendments to general appropriation bills moved by 
direction of a committee having legislative jurisdiction of the 
subject matter proposing to increase an appropriation already 
contained in the bill, or to add new items of appropriation, 
shall, at least one day before they are considered, be referred 
to the Committee on Appropriations, and when actually proposed 
to the bill no amendment proposing to increase the amount 
stated in such amendment shall be received on a point of order 
made by any Senator.
    4. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment 
offered by any other Senator which proposes general legislation 
shall be received to any general appropriation bill, nor shall 
any amendment not germane or relevant to the subject matter 
contained in the bill be received; nor shall any amendment to 
any item or clause of such bill be received which does not 
directly relate thereto; nor shall any restriction on the 
expenditure of the funds appropriated which proposes a 
limitation not authorized by law be received if such 
restriction is to take effect or cease to be effective upon the 
happening of a contingency; and all questions of relevancy of 
amendments under this rule, when raised, shall be submitted to 
the Senate and be decided without debate; and any such 
amendment or restriction to a general appropriation bill may be 
laid on the table without prejudice to the bill.
    5. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment, 
the object of which is to provide for a private claim, shall be 
received to any general appropriation bill, unless it be to 
carry out the provisions of an existing law or a treaty 
stipulation, which shall be cited on the face of the amendment.
    6. When a point of order is made against any restriction on 
the expenditure of funds appropriated in a general 
appropriation bill on the ground that the restriction violates 
this rule, the rule shall be construed strictly and, in case of 
doubt, in favor of the point of order.
    7. Every report on general appropriation bills filed by the 
Committee on Appropriations shall identify with particularity 
each recommended amendment which proposes an item of 
appropriation which is not made to carry out the provisions of 
an existing law, a treaty stipulation, or an act or resolution 
previously passed by the Senate during that session.
    8. On a point of order made by any Senator, no general 
appropriation bill or amendment thereto shall be received or 
considered if it contains a provision reappropriating 
unexpended balances of appropriations; except that this 
provision shall not apply to appropriations in continuation of 
appropriations for public works on which work has commenced.

                               RULE XVII


 reference to committees; motions to discharge; reports of committees; 
                         and hearings available


    1. Except as provided in paragraph 3, in any case in which 
a controversy arises as to the jurisdiction of any committee 
with respect to any proposed legislation, the question of 
jurisdiction shall be decided by the Presiding Officer, without 
debate, in favor of the committee which has jurisdiction over 
the subject matter which predominates in such proposed 
legislation; but such decision shall be subject to an appeal.
    2. A motion simply to refer shall not be open to amendment, 
except to add instructions.
    3. (a) Upon motion by both the majority leader or his 
designee and the minority leader or his designee, proposed 
legislation may be referred to two or more committees jointly 
or sequentially. Notice of such motion and the proposed 
legislation to which it relates shall be printed in the 
Congressional Record. The motion shall be privileged, but it 
shall not be in order until the Congressional Record in which 
the notice is printed has been available to Senators for at 
least twenty-four hours. No amendment to any such motion shall 
be in order except amendments to any instructions contained 
therein. Debate on any such motion, and all amendments thereto 
and debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, 
shall be limited to not more than two hours, the time to be 
equally divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
and the minority leader or their designees.
    (b) Proposed legislation which is referred to two or more 
committees jointly may be reported only by such committees 
jointly and only one report may accompany any proposed 
legislation so jointly reported.
    (c) A motion to refer any proposed legislation to two or 
more committees sequentially shall specify the order of 
referral.
    (d) Any motion under this paragraph may specify the portion 
or portions of proposed legislation to be considered by the 
committees, or any of them, to which such proposed legislation 
is referred, and such committees or committee shall be limited, 
in the consideration of such proposed legislation, to the 
portion or portions so specified.
    (e) Any motion under this subparagraph may contain 
instructions with respect to the time allowed for consideration 
by the committees, or any of them, to which proposed 
legislation is referred and the discharge of such committees, 
or any of them, from further consideration of such proposed 
legislation.
    4. (a) All reports of committees and motions to discharge a 
committee from the consideration of a subject, and all subjects 
from which a committee shall be discharged, shall lie over one 
day for consideration, unless by unanimous consent the Senate 
shall otherwise direct.
    (b) Whenever any committee (except the Committee on 
Appropriations) has reported any measure, by action taken in 
conformity with the requirements of paragraph 7 of rule XXVI, 
no point of order shall lie with respect to that measure on the 
ground that hearings upon that measure by the committee were 
not conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 
of rule XXVI.
    5. \3\ Any measure or matter reported by any standing 
committee shall not be considered in the Senate unless the 
report of that committee upon that measure or matter has been 
available to Members for at least two calendar days (excluding 
Sundays and legal holidays) prior to the consideration of that 
measure or matter. If hearings have been held on any such 
measure or matter so reported, the committee reporting the 
measure or matter shall make every reasonable effort to have 
such hearings printed and available for distribution to the 
Members of the Senate prior to the consideration of such 
measure or matter in the Senate. This paragraph--

    \3\ As amended, S. Res. 28, 99-2, Feb. 27, 1986.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (1) may be waived by joint agreement of the Majority Leader 
and the Minority Leader of the Senate; and
    (2) shall not apply to--
          (A) any measure for the declaration of war, or the 
        declaration of a national emergency, by the Congress, 
        and
          (B) any executive decision, determination, or action 
        which would become, or continue to be, effective unless 
        disapproved or otherwise invalidated by one or both 
        Houses of Congress.

                               RULE XVIII


               business continued from session to session


    At the second or any subsequent session of a Congress the 
legislative business of the Senate which remained undetermined 
at the close of the next preceding session of that Congress 
shall be resumed and proceeded with in the same manner as if no 
adjournment of the Senate had taken place.

                                RULE XIX


                                 debate


    1. (a) When a Senator desires to speak, he shall rise and 
address the Presiding Officer, and shall not proceed until he 
is recognized, and the Presiding Officer shall recognize the 
Senator who shall first address him. No Senator shall interrupt 
another Senator in debate without his consent, and to obtain 
such consent he shall first address the Presiding Officer, and 
no Senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in 
debate on the same legislative day without leave of the Senate, 
which shall be determined without debate.
    (b) At the conclusion of the morning hour at the beginning 
of a new legislative day or after the unfinished business or 
any pending business has first been laid before the Senate on 
any calendar day, and until after the duration of three hours 
of actual session after such business is laid down except as 
determined to the contrary by unanimous consent or on motion 
without debate, all debate shall be germane and confined to the 
specific question then pending before the Senate.
    2. No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by 
any form of words impute to another Senator or to other 
Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a 
Senator.
    3. No Senator in debate shall refer offensively to any 
State of the Union.
    4. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, in the opinion 
of the Presiding Officer transgress the rules of the Senate the 
Presiding Officer shall, either on his own motion or at the 
request of any other Senator, call him to order; and when a 
Senator shall be called to order he shall take his seat, and 
may not proceed without leave of the Senate, which, if granted, 
shall be upon motion that he be allowed to proceed in order, 
which motion shall be determined without debate. Any Senator 
directed by the Presiding Officer to take his seat, and any 
Senator requesting the Presiding Officer to require a Senator 
to take his seat, may appeal from the ruling of the Chair, 
which appeal shall be open to debate.
    5. If a Senator be called to order for words spoken in 
debate, upon the demand of the Senator or of any other Senator, 
the exceptionable words shall be taken down in writing, and 
read at the table for the information of the Senate.
    6. Whenever confusion arises in the Chamber or the 
galleries, or demonstrations of approval or disapproval are 
indulged in by the occupants of the galleries, it shall be the 
duty of the Chair to enforce order on his own initiative and 
without any point of order being made by a Senator.
    7. No Senator shall introduce to or bring to the attention 
of the Senate during its sessions any occupant in the galleries 
of the Senate. No motion to suspend this rule shall be in 
order, nor may the Presiding Officer entertain any request to 
suspend it by unanimous consent.
    8. Former Presidents of the United States shall be entitled 
to address the Senate upon appropriate notice to the Presiding 
Officer who shall thereupon make the necessary arrangements.

                                RULE XX


                           questions of order


    1. A question of order may be raised at any stage of the 
proceedings, except when the Senate is voting or ascertaining 
the presence of a quorum, and, unless submitted to the Senate, 
shall be decided by the Presiding Officer without debate, 
subject to an appeal to the Senate. When an appeal is taken, 
any subsequent question of order which may arise before the 
decision of such appeal shall be decided by the Presiding 
Officer without debate; and every appeal therefrom shall be 
decided at once, and without debate; and any appeal may be laid 
on the table without prejudice to the pending proposition, and 
thereupon shall be held as affirming the decision of the 
Presiding Officer.
    2. The Presiding Officer may submit any question of order 
for the decision of the Senate.

                                RULE XXI


                       session with closed doors


    1. On a motion made and seconded to close the doors of the 
Senate, on the discussion of any business which may, in the 
opinion of a Senator, require secrecy, the Presiding Officer 
shall direct the galleries to be cleared; and during the 
discussion of such motion the doors shall remain closed.
    2. When the Senate meets in closed session, any applicable 
provisions of rules XXIX and XXXI, including the 
confidentiality of information shall apply to any information 
and to the conduct of any debate transacted.

                               RULE XXII


                         precedence of motions

    To proceed to the consideration of executive business.
    To lay on the table.
    To postpone indefinitely.
    To postpone to a day certain.
    To commit.
    To amend.
Which several motions shall have precedence as they stand 
arranged; and the motions relating to adjournment, to take a 
recess, to proceed to the consideration of executive business, 
to lay on the table, shall be decided without debate.
    2. \4\ Notwithstanding the provisions of rule II or rule IV 
or any other rule of the Senate, at any time a motion signed by 
sixteen Senators, to bring to a close the debate upon any 
measure, motion, other matter pending before the Senate, or the 
unfinished business, is presented to the Senate, the Presiding 
Officer, or clerk at the direction of the Presiding Officer, 
shall at once state the motion to the Senate, and one hour 
after the Senate meets on the following calendar day but one, 
he shall lay the motion before the Senate and direct that the 
clerk call the roll, and upon the ascertainment that a quorum 
is present, the Presiding Officer shall, without debate, submit 
to the Senate by a yea-and-nay vote the question:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ As amended, S. Res. 28, 99-2, Feb. 27, 1986.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ``Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be 
brought to a close?'' And if that question shall be decided in 
the affirmative by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and 
sworn--except on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules, 
in which case the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-
thirds of the Senators present and voting--then said measure, 
motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the 
unfinished business, shall be the unfinished business to the 
exclusion of all other business until disposed of.
    Thereafter no Senator shall be entitled to speak in all 
more than one hour on the measure, motion, or other matter 
pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, the 
amendments thereto, and motions affecting the same, and it 
shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer to keep the time of 
each Senator who speaks. Except by unanimous consent, no 
amendment shall be proposed after the vote to bring the debate 
to a close, unless it had been submitted in writing to the 
Journal Clerk by 1 o'clock p.m. on the day following the filing 
of the cloture motion if an amendment in the first degree, and 
unless it had been so submitted at least one hour prior to the 
beginning of the cloture vote if an amendment in the second 
degree. No dilatory motion, or dilatory amendment, or amendment 
not germane shall be in order. Points of order, including 
questions of relevancy, and appeals from the decision of the 
Presiding Officer, shall be decided without debate.

motions, except a motion to table, or to reconsider and one 
quorum call on demand to establish the presence of a quorum

in order and may be conformed and reprinted at the request of 
the amendment's sponsor. The conforming changes must be limited

every other Senator shall have had the opportunity to do 
likewise.
    Notwithstanding other provisions of this rule, a Senator 
may yield all or part of his one hour to the majority or 
minority floor managers of the measure, motion, or matter or to 
the Majority or Minority Leader, but each Senator specified 
shall not have more than two hours so yielded to him and may in 
turn yield such time to other Senators.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, any 
Senator who has not used or yielded at least ten minutes, is, 
if he seeks recognition, guaranteed up to ten minutes, 
inclusive, to speak only.
    After cloture is invoked, the reading of any amendment, 
including House amendments, shall be dispensed with when the 
proposed amendment has been identified and has been available 
in printed form at the desk of the Members for not less than 
twenty-four hours.

of any subcommittee of such committee or joint committee.
    (4) No committee of the Senate may establish any subunit of

subparagraph (a)(2).
    (e)(1) No Senator shall serve at any time as chairman of 
more than one standing, select, or special committee of the 
Senate or joint committee of the Congress, except that a 
Senator may serve as chairman of any joint committee of the 
Congress having jurisdiction with respect to a subject matter 
which is directly related to the jurisdiction of a standing

which he is a member.

listed in paragraph 2 may serve at any time as the chairman of 
only one subcommittee of all committees listed in paragraph 2 
of which he is a member and may serve at any time as the

of title I of the Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 
1977 was serving as the chairman or ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the District of Columbia or the Committee on 
Post Office and Civil Service may serve on the Committee on 
Governmental Affairs in addition to serving on two other 
standing committees listed in paragraph 2. At the request of 
any such Senator, he shall be appointed to serve on such 
committee but, while serving on such committee and two other 
standing committees listed in paragraph 2, he may not serve on 
any committee listed in paragraph 3 (a) or (b) other than the 
Committee on Rules and Administration. The preceding provisions 
of this subparagraph shall apply with respect to any Senator 
only so long as his service as a member of the Committee on 
Governmental Affairs is continuous after the date on which the 
appointment of the majority and minority members of the 
Committee on Governmental Affairs is initially completed.

                               RULE XXVI


                          committee procedure


    1. \17\ Each standing committee, including any subcommittee 
of any such committee, is authorized to hold such hearings, to 
sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, 
recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by 
subpena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and the 
production of such correspondence, books, papers, and 
documents, to take such testimony and to make such expenditures 
out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may be authorized 
by resolutions of the Senate. Each such committee may make 
investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, may 
report such hearings as may be had by it, and may employ 
stenographic assistance at a cost not exceeding the amount 
prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration. \18\ 
The expenses of the committee shall be paid from the contingent 
fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved by the chairman.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ As amended, S. Res. 281, 96-2 Mar. 11, 1980, effective Feb. 
28, 1981.
    \18\ Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 68c, the Committee on Rules and 
Administration issues ``Regulations Governing Rates Payable to 
Commercial Reporting Firms for Reporting Committee Hearings in the 
Senate.'' Copies of the regulations currently in effect may be obtained 
from the Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. \19\ Each committee \20\ shall adopt rules (not 
inconsistent with the Rules of the Senate) governing the 
procedure of such committee. The rules of each committee shall 
be published in the Congressional Record not later than March 1 
of the first year of each Congress, except that if any such 
committee is established on or after February 1 of a year, the 
rules of that committee during the year of establishment shall 
be published in the Congressional Record not later than sixty 
days after such establishment. Any amendment to the rules of a 
committee shall not take effect until the amendment is 
published in the Congressional Record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ As amended, S. Res. 250, 101-2, Mar. 1, 1990.
    \20\ The term ``each committee'' when used in these rules includes 
standing, select, and special committees unless otherwise specified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3. Each standing committee (except the Committee on 
Appropriations) shall fix regular weekly, biweekly, or monthly 
meeting days for the transaction of business before the 
committee and additional meetings may be called by the chairman 
as he may deem necessary. If at least three members of any such 
committee desire that a special meeting of the committee be 
called by the chairman, those members may file in the offices 
of the committee their written request to the chairman for that 
special meeting. Immediately upon the filing of the request, 
the clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the 
filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after the 
filing of the request, the chairman does not call the requested 
special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after 
the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the 
committee may file in the offices of the committee their 
written notice that a special meeting of the committee will be 
held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting. The 
committee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon 
the filing of the notice, the clerk of the committee shall 
notify all members of the committee that such special meeting 
will be held and inform them of its date and hour. If the 
chairman of any such committee is not present at any regular, 
additional, or special meeting of the committee, the ranking 
member of the majority party on the committee who is present 
shall preside at that meeting.
    4. (a) Each committee (except the Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget) shall make 
public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of 
any hearing to be conducted by the committee on any measure or 
matter at least one week before the commencement of that 
hearing unless the committee determines that there is good 
cause to begin such hearing at an earlier date.
    (b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) 
shall require each witness who is to appear before the 
committee in any hearing to file with the clerk of the 
committee, at least one day before the date of the appearance 
of that witness, a written statement of his proposed testimony 
unless the committee chairman and the ranking minority member 
determine that there is good cause for noncompliance. If so 
requested by any committee, the staff of the committee shall 
prepare for the use of the members of the committee before each 
day of hearing before the committee a digest of the statements 
which have been so filed by witnesses who are to appear before 
the committee on that day.
    (c) After the conclusion of each day of hearing, if so 
requested by any committee, the staff shall prepare for the use 
of the members of the committee a summary of the testimony 
given before the committee on that day. After approval by the 
chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee, each 
such summary may be printed as a part of the committee hearings 
if such hearings are ordered by the committee to be printed.
    (d) Whenever any hearing is conducted by a committee 
(except the Committee on Appropriations) upon any measure or 
matter, the minority on the committee shall be entitled, upon 
request made by a majority of the minority members to the 
chairman before the completion of such hearing, to call 
witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to 
the measure or matter during at least one day of hearing 
thereon.
    5. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the rules, 
when the Senate is in session, no committee of the Senate or 
any subcommittee thereof may meet, without special leave, after 
the conclusion of the first two hours after the meeting of the 
Senate commenced and in no case after two o'clock postmeridian 
unless consent therefor has been obtained from the majority 
leader and the minority leader (or in the event of the absence 
of either of such leaders, from his designee). The prohibition 
contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to the 
Committee on Appropriations or the Committee on the Budget. The 
majority leader or his designee shall announce to the Senate 
whenever consent has been given under this subparagraph and 
shall state the time and place of such meeting. The right to 
make such announcement of consent shall have the same priority 
as the filing of a cloture motion.
    (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee 
thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open 
to the public, except that a meeting or series of meetings by a 
committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same subject for a 
period of no more than fourteen calendar days may be closed to 
the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed 
session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in 
clauses (1) through (6) would require the meeting to be closed, 
followed immediately by a record vote in open session by a 
majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee when 
it is determined that the matters to be discussed or the 
testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings--
          (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret 
        in the interests of national defense or the 
        confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the 
        United States;
          (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff 
        personnel or internal staff management or procedure;
          (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or 
        misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional 
        standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an 
        individual to public contempt or obloquy, or will 
        represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy 
        of an individual;
          (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law 
        enforcement agent or will disclose any information 
        relating to the investigation or prosecution of a 
        criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in 
        the interests of effective law enforcement;
          (5) will disclose information relating to the trade 
        secrets of financial or commercial information 
        pertaining specifically to a given person if--
      (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be 
        kept confidential by Government officers and employees; 
        or
      (B) the information has been obtained by the Government 
        on a confidential basis, other than through an 
        application by such person for a specific Government 
        financial or other benefit, and is required to be kept 
        secret in order to prevent undue injury to the 
        competitive position of such person; or
          (6) may divulge matters required to be kept 
        confidential under other provisions of law or 
        Government regulations.
    (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or 
subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be 
broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules as 
the committee or subcommittee may adopt.
    (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting 
that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval or 
disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance at any 
such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to enforce 
order on his own initiative and without any point of order 
being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it necessary to 
maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, and 
the committee may act in closed session for so long as there is 
doubt of the assurance of order.
    (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete 
transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record the 
proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not such 
meeting or any part thereof is closed under this paragraph, 
unless a majority of its members vote to forgo such a record.
    6. Morning meetings of committees and subcommittees thereof 
shall be scheduled for one or both of the periods prescribed in 
this paragraph. The first period shall end at eleven o'clock 
antemeridian. The second period shall begin at eleven o'clock 
antemeridian and end at two o'clock postmeridian.
    7. (a)(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, each 
committee, and each subcommittee thereof is authorized to fix 
the number of its members (but not less than one-third of its 
entire membership) who shall constitute a quorum thereof for 
the transaction of such business as may be considered by said 
committee, except that no measure or matter or recommendation 
shall be reported from any committee unless a majority of the 
committee were physically present.
    (2) Each such committee, or subcommittee, is authorized to 
fix a lesser number than one-third of its entire membership who 
shall constitute a quorum thereof for the purpose of taking 
sworn testimony.
    (3) The vote of any committee to report a measure or matter 
shall require the concurrence of a majority of the members of 
the committee who are present. No vote of any member of any 
committee to report a measure or matter may be cast by proxy if 
rules adopted by such committee forbid the casting of votes for 
that purpose by proxy; however, proxies may not be voted when 
the absent committee member has not been informed of the matter 
on which he is being recorded and has not affirmatively 
requested that he be so recorded. Action by any committee in 
reporting any measure or matter in accordance with the 
requirements of this subparagraph shall constitute the 
ratification by the committee of all action theretofore taken 
by the committee with respect to that measure or matter, 
including votes taken upon the measure or matter or any 
amendment thereto, and no point of order shall lie with respect 
to that measure or matter on the ground that such previous 
action with respect thereto by such committee was not taken in 
compliance with such requirements.
    (b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) 
shall keep a complete record of all committee action. Such 
record shall include a record of the votes on any question on 
which a record vote is demanded. The results of rollcall votes 
taken in any meeting of any committee upon any measure, or any 
amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee report 
on that measure unless previously announced by the committee, 
and such announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes 
cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to each such 
measure and amendment by each member of the committee who was 
present at that meeting.
    (c) Whenever any committee by rollcall vote reports any 
measure or matter, the report of the committee upon such 
measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes cast 
by each member of the committee in favor of and in opposition 
to such measure or matter. Nothing contained in this 
subparagraph shall abrogate the power of any committee to adopt 
rules--
          (1) providing for proxy voting on all matters other 
        than the reporting of a measure or matter, or
          (2) providing in accordance with subparagraph (a) for 
        a lesser number as a quorum for any action other than 
        the reporting of a measure or matter.
    8. (a) In order to assist the Senate in--
          (1) its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of the 
        application, administration, and execution of the laws 
        enacted by the Congress, and
          (2) its formulation, consideration, and enactment of 
        such modifications of or changes in those laws, and of 
        such additional legislation, as may be necessary or 
        appropriate,
each standing committee (except the Committees on 
Appropriations and the Budget), shall review and study, on a 
continuing basis the application, administration, and execution 
of those laws, or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is 
within the legislative jurisdiction of that committee. Such 
committees may carry out the required analysis, appraisal, and 
evaluation themselves, or by contract, or may require a 
Government agency to do so and furnish a report thereon to the 
Senate. Such committees may rely on such techniques as pilot 
testing, analysis of costs in comparison with benefits, or 
provision for evaluation after a defined period of time.
    (b) In each odd-numbered year, each such committee shall 
submit, not later than March 31, to the Senate, a report on the 
activities of that committee under this paragraph during the 
Congress ending at noon on January 3 of such year.
    9. (a) \21\ Except as provided in subparagraph (b), each 
committee shall report one authorization resolution each year 
authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the 
contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses, including 
the compensation of members of its staff and agency 
contributions related to such compensation, during the period 
beginning on March 1 of such year and ending on the last day of 
February of the following year. Such annual authorization 
resolution shall be reported not later than January 31 of each 
year, except that, whenever the designation of members of 
standing committees of the Senate occurs during the first 
session of a Congress at a date later than January 20, such 
resolution may be reported at any time within thirty days after 
the date on which the designation of such members is completed. 
After the annual authorization resolution of a committee for a 
year has been agreed to, such committee may procure 
authorization to make additional expenditures out of the 
contingent fund of the Senate during that year only by 
reporting a supplemental authorization resolution. Each 
supplemental authorization resolution reported by a committee 
shall amend the annual authorization resolution of such 
committee for that year and shall be accompanied by a report 
specifying with particularity the purpose for which such 
authorization is sought and the reason why such authorization 
could not have been sought at the time of the submission by 
such committee of its annual authorization resolution for that 
year.

    \21\ As amended, S. Res. 281, 96-2, Mar. 11, 1980, effective Jan. 
1, 1981; Res. 479, 100-2, Sept. 30, 1988.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (b) In lieu of the procedure provided in subparagraph (a), 
the Committee on Rules and Administration may--
          (1) direct each committee to report an authorization 
        resolution for a two year budget period beginning on 
        March 1 of the first session of a Congress; and
          (2) report one authorization resolution containing 
        more than one committee authorization resolution for a 
        one year or two year budget period.
    10. (a) All committee hearings, records, data, charts, and 
files shall be kept separate and distinct from the 
congressional office records of the Member serving as chairman 
of the committee; and such records shall be the property of the 
Senate and all members of the committee and the Senate shall 
have access to such records. Each committee is authorized to 
have printed and bound such testimony and other data presented 
at hearings held by the committee.
    (b) It shall be the duty of the chairman of each committee 
to report or cause to be reported promptly to the Senate any 
measure approved by his committee and to take or cause to be 
taken necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote. In any 
event, the report of any committee upon a measure which has 
been approved by the committee shall be filed within seven 
calendar days (exclusive of days on which the Senate is not in 
session) after the day on which there has been filed with the 
clerk of the committee a written and signed request of a 
majority of the committee for the reporting of that measure. 
Upon the filing of any such request, the clerk of the committee 
shall transmit immediately to the chairman of the committee 
notice of the filing of that request. This subparagraph does 
not apply to the Committee on Appropriations.
    (c) If at the time of approval of a measure or matter by 
any committee (except for the Committee on Appropriations), any 
member of the committee gives notice of intention to file 
supplemental, minority, or additional views, that member shall 
be entitled to not less than three calendar days in which to 
file such views, in writing, with the clerk of the committee. 
All such views so filed by one or more members of the committee 
shall be included within, and shall be a part of, the report 
filed by the committee with respect to that measure or matter. 
The report of the committee upon that measure or matter shall 
be printed in a single volume which--
          (1) shall include all supplemental, minority, or 
        additional views which have been submitted by the time 
        of the filing of the report, and
          (2) shall bear upon its cover a recital that 
        supplemental, minority, or additional views are 
        included as part of the report. This subparagraph does 
        not preclude--
      (A) the immediate filing and printing of a committee 
        report unless timely request for the opportunity to 
        file supplemental, minority, or additional views has 
        been made as provided by this subparagraph; or
      (B) the filing by any such committee of any supplemental 
        report upon any measure or matter which may be required 
        for the correction of any technical error in a previous 
        report made by that committee upon that measure or 
        matter.
    11. (a) The report accompanying each bill or joint 
resolution of a public character reported by any committee 
(except the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on 
the Budget) shall contain--
          (1) an estimate, made by such committee, of the costs 
        which would be incurred in carrying out such bill or 
        joint resolution in the fiscal year in which it is 
        reported and in each of the five fiscal years following 
        such fiscal year (or for the authorized duration of any 
        program authorized by such bill or joint resolution, if 
        less than five years), except that, in the case of 
        measures affecting the revenues, such reports shall 
        require only an estimate of the gain or loss in 
        revenues for a one-year period; and
          (2) a comparison of the estimate of costs described 
        in subparagraph (1) made by such committee with any 
        estimate of costs made by any Federal agency; or
          (3) in lieu of such estimate or comparison, or both, 
        a statement of the reasons why compliance by the 
        committee with the requirements of subparagraph (1) or 
        (2), or both, is impracticable.
    (b) Each such report (except those by the Committee on 
Appropriations) shall also contain--
          (1) an evaluation, made by such committee, of the 
        regulatory impact which would be incurred in carrying 
        out the bill or joint resolution. The evaluation shall 
        include (A) an estimate of the numbers of individuals 
        and businesses who would be regulated and a 
        determination of the groups and classes of such 
        individuals and businesses, (B) a determination of the 
        economic impact of such regulation on the individuals, 
        consumers, and businesses affected, (C) a determination 
        of the impact on the personal privacy of the 
        individuals affected, and (D) a determination of the 
        amount of additional paperwork that will result from 
        the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill 
        or joint resolution, which determination may include, 
        but need not be limited to, estimates of the amount of 
        time and financial costs required of affected parties, 
        showing whether the effects of the bill or joint 
        resolution could be substantial, as well as reasonable 
        estimates of the recordkeeping requirements that may be 
        associated with the bill or joint resolution; or
          (2) in lieu of such evaluation, a statement of the 
        reasons why compliance by the committee with the 
        requirements of clause (1) is impracticable.
    (c) It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider any 
such bill or joint resolution if the report of the committee on 
such bill or joint resolution does not comply with the 
provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) on the objection of any 
Senator.
    12. Whenever a committee reports a bill or a joint 
resolution repealing or amending any statute or part thereof it 
shall make a report thereon and shall include in such report or 
in an accompanying document (to be prepared by the staff of 
such committee) (a) the text of the statute or part thereof 
which is proposed to be repealed; and (b) a comparative print 
of that part of the bill or joint resolution making the 
amendment and of the statute or part thereof proposed to be 
amended, showing by stricken-through type and italics, parallel 
columns, or other appropriate typographical devices the 
omissions and insertions which would be made by the bill or 
joint resolution if enacted in the form recommended by the 
committee. This paragraph shall not apply to any such report in 
which it is stated that, in the opinion of the committee, it is 
necessary to dispense with the requirements of this subsection 
to expedite the business of the Senate.
    13.(a) Each committee (except the Committee on 
Appropriations) which has legislative jurisdiction shall, in 
its consideration of all bills and joint resolutions of a 
public character within its jurisdiction, endeavor to insure 
that--
          (1) all continuing programs of the Federal Government 
        and of the government of the District of Columbia, 
        within the jurisdiction of such committee or joint 
        committee, are designed; and
          (2) all continuing activities of Federal agencies, 
        within the jurisdiction of such committee or joint 
        committee, are carried on;
so that, to the extent consistent with the nature, 
requirements, and objectives of those programs and activities, 
appropriations therefor will be made annually.
    (b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) 
shall with respect to any continuing program within its 
jurisdiction for which appropriations are not made annually, 
review such program, from time to time, in order to ascertain 
whether such program could be modified so that appropriations 
therefor would be made annually.

                               RULE XXVII


                            committee staff


    1. \22\ Staff members appointed to assist minority members 
of committees pursuant to authority of a resolution described 
in paragraph 9 of rule XXVI or other Senate resolution shall be 
accorded equitable treatment with respect to the fixing of 
salary rates, the assignment of facilities, and the 
accessibility of committee records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ Pursuant to S. Res. 281, 96-2, Mar. 11, 1980, effective Feb. 
28, 1981, paragraph 1 of rule XXVII was repealed. Accordingly, 
subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of paragraph 2 were renumbered as 
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. The minority shall receive fair consideration in the 
appointment of staff personnel pursuant to authority of a 
resolution described in paragraph 9 of rule XXVI.
    3. The staffs of committees (including personnel appointed 
pursuant to authority of a resolution described in paragraph 9 
of rule XXVI or other Senate resolution) should reflect the 
relative number of majority and minority members of committees. 
A majority of the minority members of any committee may, by 
resolution, request that at least one-third of all funds of the 
committee for personnel (other than those funds determined by 
the chairman and ranking minority member to be allocated for 
the administrative and clerical functions of the committee as a 
whole) be allocated to the minority members of such committee 
for compensation of minority staff as the minority members may 
decide. The committee shall thereafter adjust its budget to 
comply with such resolution. Such adjustment shall be equitably 
made over a four-year period, commencing July 1, 1977, with not 
less than one-half being made in two years. Upon request by a 
majority of the minority members of any committee by 
resolution, proportionate space, equipment, and facilities 
shall be provided for such minority staff.
    4. No committee shall appoint to its staff any experts or 
other personnel detailed or assigned from any department or 
agency of the Government, except with the written permission of 
the Committee on Rules and Administration.

                              RULE XXVIII


             conference committees; reports; open meetings


    1. The presentation of reports of committees of conference 
shall always be in order when available on each Senator's desk, 
except when the Journal is being read or a question of order or 
a motion to adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is voting 
or ascertaining the presence of a quorum; and when received the 
question of proceeding to the consideration of the report, if 
raised, shall be immediately put, and shall be determined 
without debate.
    2. Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not 
committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from 
the bill matter agreed to by both Houses. If new matter is 
inserted in the report, or if matter which was agreed to by 
both Houses is stricken from the bill, a point of order may be 
made against the report, and if the point of order is 
sustained, the report is rejected or shall be recommitted to 
the committee of conference if the House of Representatives has 
not already acted thereon.
    3. (a) In any case in which a disagreement to an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute has been referred to conferees, 
it shall be in order for the conferees to report a substitute 
on the same subject matter; but they may not include in the 
report matter not committed to them by either House. They may, 
however, include in their report in any such case matter which 
is a germane modification of subjects in disagreement.
    (b) In any case in which the conferees violate subparagraph 
(a), the conference report shall be subject to a point of 
order.
    4. Each report made by a committee of conference to the 
Senate shall be printed as a report of the Senate. As so 
printed, such report shall be accompanied by an explanatory 
statement prepared jointly by the conferees on the part of the 
House and the conferees on the part of the Senate. Such 
statement shall be sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform 
the Senate as to the effect which the amendments or 
propositions contained in such report will have upon the 
measure to which those amendments or propositions relate.
    5. If time for debate in the consideration of any report of 
a committee of conference upon the floor of the Senate is 
limited, the time allotted for debate shall be equally divided 
between the majority party and the minority party.
    6. Each conference committee between the Senate and the 
House of Representatives shall be open to the public except 
when managers of either the Senate or the House of 
Representatives in open session determine by a rollcall vote of 
a majority of those managers present, that all or part of the 
remainder of the meeting on the day of the vote shall be closed 
to the public.

                               RULE XXIX


                           executive sessions


    1. When the President of the United States shall meet the 
Senate in the Senate Chamber for the consideration of Executive 
business, he shall have a seat on the right of the Presiding 
Officer. When the Senate shall be convened by the President of 
the United States to any other place, the Presiding Officer of 
the Senate and the Senators shall attend at the place 
appointed, with the necessary officers of the Senate.
    2. When acting upon confidential or Executive business, 
unless the same shall be considered in open Executive session, 
the Senate Chamber shall be cleared of all persons except the 
Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, the Principal Legislative 
Clerk, the Parliamentarian, the Executive Clerk, the Minute and 
Journal Clerk, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretaries to the 
Majority and the Minority, and such other officers as the 
Presiding Officer shall think necessary; and all such officers 
shall be sworn to secrecy.
    3. All confidential communications made by the President of 
the United States to the Senate shall be by the Senators and 
the officers of the Senate kept secret; and all treaties which 
may be laid before the Senate, and all remarks, votes, and 
proceedings thereon shall also be kept secret, until the Senate 
shall, by their resolution, take off the injunction of secrecy.
    4. Whenever the injunction of secrecy shall be removed from 
any part of the proceedings of the Senate in closed Executive 
or legislative session, the order of the Senate removing the 
same shall be entered in the Legislative Journal as well as in 
the Executive Journal, and shall be published in the 
Congressional Record under the direction of the Secretary of 
the Senate.
    5. \23\ Any Senator, officer, or employee of the Senate who 
shall disclose the secret or confidential business or 
proceedings of the Senate, including the business and 
proceedings of the committees, subcommittees, and offices of 
the Senate, shall be liable, if a Senator, to suffer expulsion 
from the body; and if an officer or employee, to dismissal from 
the service of the Senate, and to punishment for contempt.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ As amended, S. Res. 363, 102-2, Oct. 8, 1992.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    6. Whenever, by the request of the Senate or any committee 
thereof, any documents or papers shall be communicated to the 
Senate by the President or the head of any department relating 
to any matter pending in the Senate, the proceedings in regard 
to which are secret or confidential under the rules, said 
documents and papers shall be considered as confidential, and 
shall not be disclosed without leave of the Senate.

                                RULE XXX


               executive session--proceedings on treaties


    1. (a) When a treaty shall be laid before the Senate for 
ratification, it shall be read a first time; and no motion in 
respect to it shall be in order, except to refer it to a 
committee, to print it in confidence for the use of the Senate, 
or to remove the injunction of secrecy.
    (b) \24\ When a treaty is reported from a committee with or 
without amendment, it shall, unless the Senate unanimously 
otherwise directs, lie over one day for consideration; after 
which it may be read a second time, after which amendments may 
be proposed. At any stage of such proceedings the Senate may 
remove the injunction of secrecy from the treaty.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ As amended, S. Res. 28, 99-2, Feb. 27, 1986.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (c) The decisions thus made shall be reduced to the form of 
a resolution of ratification, with or without amendments, as 
the case may be, which shall be proposed on a subsequent day, 
unless, by unanimous consent, the Senate determine otherwise, 
at which stage no amendment to the treaty shall be received 
unless by unanimous consent; but the resolution of ratification 
when pending shall be open to amendment in the form of 
reservations, declarations, statements, or understandings.
    (d) On the final question to advise and consent to the 
ratification in the form agreed to, the concurrence of two-
thirds of the Senators present shall be necessary to determine 
it in the affirmative; but all other motions and questions upon 
a treaty shall be decided by a majority vote, except a motion 
to postpone indefinitely, which shall be decided by a vote of 
two-thirds.
    2. Treaties transmitted by the President to the Senate for 
ratification shall be resumed at the second or any subsequent 
session of the same Congress at the stage in which they were 
left at the final adjournment of the session at which they were 
transmitted; but all proceedings on treaties shall terminate 
with the Congress, and they shall be resumed at the 
commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings had 
previously been had thereon.

                               RULE XXXI


             executive session--proceedings on nominations


    1. When nominations shall be made by the President of the 
United States to the Senate, they shall, unless otherwise 
ordered, be referred to appropriate committees; and the final 
question on every nomination shall be, ``Will the Senate advise 
and consent to this nomination?'' which question shall not be 
put on the same day on which the nomination is received, nor on 
the day on which it may be reported by a committee, unless by 
unanimous consent.
    2. All business in the Senate shall be transacted in open 
session, unless the Senate as provided in rule XXI by a 
majority vote shall determine that a particular nomination, 
treaty, or other matter shall be considered in closed executive 
session, in which case all subsequent proceedings with respect 
to said nomination, treaty, or other matter shall be kept 
secret: Provided, That the injunction of secrecy as to the 
whole or any part of proceedings in closed executive session 
may be removed on motion adopted by a majority vote of the 
Senate in closed executive session: Provided further, That any 
Senator may make public his vote in closed executive session.
    3. When a nomination is confirmed or rejected, any Senator 
voting in the majority may move for a reconsideration on the 
same day on which the vote was taken, or on either of the next 
two days of actual executive session of the Senate; but if a 
notification of the confirmation or rejection of a nomination 
shall have been sent to the President before the expiration of 
the time within which a motion to reconsider may be made, the 
motion to reconsider shall be accompanied by a motion to 
request the President to return such notification to the 
Senate. Any motion to reconsider the vote on a nomination may 
be laid on the table without prejudice to the nomination, and 
shall be a final disposition of such motion.
    4. Nominations confirmed or rejected by the Senate shall 
not be returned by the Secretary to the President until the 
expiration of the time limited for making a motion to 
reconsider the same, or while a motion to reconsider is pending 
unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.
    5. When the Senate shall adjourn or take a recess for more 
than thirty days, all motions to reconsider a vote upon a 
nomination which has been confirmed or rejected by the Senate, 
which shall be pending at the time of taking such adjournment 
or recess, shall fall; and the Secretary shall return all such 
nominations to the President as confirmed or rejected by the 
Senate, as the case may be.
    6. Nominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the 
session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at any 
succeeding session without being again made to the Senate by 
the President; and if the Senate shall adjourn or take a recess 
for more than thirty days, all nominations pending and not 
finally acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or 
recess shall be returned by the Secretary to the President, and 
shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made 
to the Senate by the President.
    7. (a) The Official Reporters shall be furnished with a 
list of nominations to office after the proceedings of the day 
on which they are received, and a like list of all 
confirmations and rejections.
    (b) All nominations to office shall be prepared for the 
printer by the Official Reporter, and printed in the 
Congressional Record, after the proceedings of the day in which 
they are received, also nominations recalled, and confirmed.
    (c) The Secretary shall furnish to the press, and to the 
public upon request, the names of nominees confirmed or 
rejected on the day on which a final vote shall be had, except 
when otherwise ordered by the Senate.

                               RULE XXXII


  the president furnished with copies of records of executive sessions


    The President of the United States shall, from time to 
time, be furnished with an authenticated transcript of the 
public executive records of the Senate, but no further extract 
from the Executive Journal shall be furnished by the Secretary, 
except by special order of the Senate; and no paper, except 
original treaties transmitted to the Senate by the President of 
the United States, and finally acted upon by the Senate, shall 
be delivered from the office of the Secretary without an order 
of the Senate for that purpose.

                              RULE XXXIII


               senate chamber--senate wing of the capitol


    1. The Senate Chamber shall not be granted for any other 
purpose than for the use of the Senate; no smoking shall be 
permitted at any time on the floor of the Senate, or lighted 
cigars, cigarettes, or pipes be brought into the Chamber.
    2. It shall be the duty of the Committee on Rules and 
Administration to make all rules and regulations respecting 
such parts of the Capitol, its passages and galleries, 
including the restaurant and the Senate Office Buildings, as 
are or may be set apart for the use of the Senate and its 
officers, to be enforced under the direction of the Presiding 
Officer. The Committee shall make such regulations respecting 
the reporters' galleries of the Senate, together with the 
adjoining rooms and facilities, as will confine their occupancy 
and use to bona fide reporters of newspapers and periodicals, 
and of news or press associations for daily news dissemination 
through radio, television, wires, and cables, and similar media 
of transmission. These regulations shall so provide for the use 
of such space and facilities as fairly to distribute their use 
to all such media of news dissemination.

                               RULE XXXIV


                      public financial disclosure
