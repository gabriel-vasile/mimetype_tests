                         APPEARANCES

                        for Appellant
                              
                  Gilbert J. Ginsburg, Esq.
                              
                              
                           DIGEST

Neither a Contracting Officer nor any party has standing  to
file  a  size  protest  against a  concern  which  has  been
eliminated   from  consideration  for  award   for   reasons
unrelated to size, because the protest is not related  to  a
particular procurement.

The  Administrative  Judge will vacate a size  determination
issued in response to a size protest filed by a party  which
lacked standing to protest.


                          DECISION

HOLLEMAN, Administrative Judge:

                              
                        Jurisdiction

     This appeal is decided under the Small Business Act  of
1958,  15  U.S.C. Sections 631 et seq., and 13 C.F.R.  Parts
121 (1998) and 134 (1999).
     
                           Issues
                              
     Whether a Contracting Officer or any party has standing
to  file  a  size protest against a concern which  has  been
eliminated   from  consideration  for  award   for   reasons
unrelated to size.

     Whether  the  Administrative Judge will vacate  a  size
determination issued in response to a size protest filed  by
a party which lacked standing to protest.

                              
                       I.  BACKGROUND

     On  May  29,  1998, the Department of  the  Air  Force,
Brooks Air Force Base, Texas (Air Force), issued the subject
solicitation for Hospital Aseptic Management System Services
as an unrestricted procurement with an evaluation preference
for  small disadvantaged business concerns (SDBs).   The  CO
assigned    to    the   procurement   Standard    Industrial
Classification  code  (SIC)  7349,  Building  Cleaning   and
Maintenance  Services,  Not  Elsewhere  Classified,  with  a
corresponding  $12  million  average  annual  receipts  size
standard.  Offers were due on June 19, 1998.
     
     On  June  22,  1998, the CO issued Amendment  1,  which
extended the due date for offers to July 20, 1998.   The  CO
issued Amendment 2 on July 13, 1998, and Amendment 3 on July
16, 1998, making technical changes to the solicitation.
     
     On  February  18,  1999,  the  Air  Force  awarded  the
contract to Rite-Way Services.  On February 22, 1999, the CO
notified unsuccessful offerors.
     
     On  February 25, 1999, Harry A. Stroh Associates,  Inc.
(Appellant), the incumbent contractor and an offeror,  filed
a protest against the award at the General Accounting Office
(GAO).   On  February 26, 1999, the CO suspended performance
on the contract, pending the outcome of the protest.
     
     On  March  3,  1999, the Air Force filed a  motion  for
summary  dismissal of Appellant's protest.   The  Air  Force
asserted  Appellant  lacked  standing  before  GAO,  because
Integrity Management Services (Integrity), another  offeror,
not Appellant, was next in line for award.
     
     On  March  4,  1999,  Appellant  filed  a  supplemental
protest with GAO.  On March 8, 1999, the Air Force moved  to
dismiss this protest as well, also for lack of standing.  On
March  11, 1999, Rite-Way joined in the Air Force's  motions
to  dismiss  Appellant's GAO protests for lack of  standing.
On  March 19, 1999, in a one-sentence order, GAO denied  the
Air Force's and Rite-Way's motions for summary dismissal.
     
     Also  on  March  4,  1999, Appellant filed  --  through
counsel  --  a  size  protest against Integrity.   Appellant
asserted Integrity was affiliated with National Maintenance,
Inc. and thus was other than small.
     
     On March 16, 1999, the CO adopted the size protest, and
forwarded it to the Small Business Administration (SBA) Area
VI  Office  of Government Contracting (Area Office)  in  San
Francisco,  California.  On March 24, 1999, the Area  Office
informed Integrity of the protest, directed it to respond to
the size protest allegations, and to submit an SBA Form 355,
together with certain other information.
     
     On  April  6,  1999,  the Area  Office  issued  a  size
determination concluding that Integrity is an eligible small
business.   On April 12, 1999, Appellant received  the  size
determination.   On  April  16, 1999,  Appellant  filed  the
instant  appeal with this Office.  On May 3, 1999, Integrity
filed a response to the appeal.
     
     On  April 7, 1999, the Air Force filed its response  to
Appellant's GAO protests, in which it renewed its motion  to
dismiss  for  lack of standing, reiterating that  Integrity,
not  Appellant, was next in line for award.  On  April  8th,
Rite-Way filed its response to Appellant's GAO protests,  in
which  it  also renewed its motion to dismiss  for  lack  of
standing.
     
     On  May  17, 1999, the Administrative Judge  issued  an
Order  to  Show Cause why he should not dismiss the  instant
appeal for the following reasons:  the CO lacked standing to
protest; Appellant lacked standing to appeal; the matter  is
not  ripe for decision; and the appeal is a request  for  an
advisory opinion.

      On  May  26, 1999, Appellant filed a response  to  the
Order  to  Show  Cause.  Appellant asserts it  is  adversely
affected  by  the size determination, because  its  standing
before GAO is in question if Integrity is entitled to a  10%
evaluation preference as an SDB.  If not, Appellant is  next
in line for award. [1]

      On June 1, 1999, GAO dismissed Appellant's protest  on
the  merits.   GAO did not further address  the  motions  to
dismiss  for  lack of standing.  Harry A. Stroh  Associates,
Inc., B-282134, B-282134.2 (June 1, 1999).
     
                       II. DISCUSSION

      Appellant filed the instant appeal within 15  days  of
receiving  the  size determination, and it is  thus  timely.
13 C.F.R. Section 134.304(a)(1).

      The threshold issue in this case, which ultimately  is
dispositive, is whether the CO had standing to file  a  size
protest  against Integrity.  While no party has  raised  the
issue  of standing before OHA, the Administrative Judge  may
make  his  own  inquiry sua sponte.   Size  Appeal  of  J.E.
McAmis,  Inc.,  No. 4114 at 4 (1995).  He  does  so  because
standing  is  a jurisdictional requirement which  cannot  be
waived; it may be raised at all stages of litigation.

      The  Administrative  Judge notes  several  overlapping
principles  relative to standing before OHA.  A  Contracting
Officer  always  has  standing to file  a  size  protest  in
connection with a particular procurement or sale.  13 C.F.R.
Section  121.1001(a)(1)(ii).  However, this Office has  held
that,  when a Contracting Officer eliminates a concern  from
consideration for award because of reasons unrelated to  its
size,  a protest against that concern's size status  is  not
deemed to relate to a particular procurement. Size Appeal of
Farr/Spriggs Reporting U.S.A., No. 3732 at 7-8 (1993).   For
that  reason,   an Area Office must dismiss a size  protest,
even  a  Contracting  Officer's protest,  where  it  is  not
related  to a particular procurement.  Id. at 7;  13  C.F.R.
Section 121.1007(a).

      Here,  the  CO eliminated Integrity from consideration
for  award  for  reasons unrelated to its  size  (e.g.,  she
determined Rite-Way's price was lower) when she awarded  the
contract  to  Rite-Way.  Accordingly,  based  on  the  above
authority, the Administrative Judge concludes that,  because
the CO's protest against Integrity's size was not related to
a  particular  procurement, the CO had  no  standing.   This
Office will vacate a size determination where the underlying
protest was filed by a party without standing.  Size  Appeal
of MBI Corporation, No. 4356 at 7 (1999). [2]

                              
                       III. CONCLUSION
     
     For the above reasons, the Administrative Judge VACATES
the  Area  Office  size  determination,  and  DISMISSES  the
instant appeal.

     This  is  the  final  decision of  the  Small  Business
Administration.  See 13 C.F.R. Section 134.316(b).

_________________________

       [1]  Appellant also asserts its initial size  protest
was in fact timely because it did not learn Integrity was an
intervening offeror until March 3rd.
       [2]  The  Administrative Judge rejects as  irrelevant
Appellant's  argument that its protest was  timely,  because
its   protest   also  was  not  related  to   a   particular
procurement.  Thus, the Area Office would have been required
to   dismiss  it.   13  C.F.R.  Sections  121.1001(a)(1)(i);
121.1007(a).  Moreover, GAO's denial of the Air Force's  and
Rite-Way's  motions to dismiss Appellant's protest  and  its
refusal  to  reconsider those motions in its final  decision
renders   moot   Appellant's   argument   that   the    size
determination affects its standing at GAO.
