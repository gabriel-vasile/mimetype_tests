      Congress, and
        (2) its formulation, consideration, and enactment of such
      modifications of or changes in those laws, and of such additional

    of laws, the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of
    that committee. Such committees may carry out the required
    analysis, appraisal, and evaluation themselves, or by contract, or
    may require a Government agency to do so and furnish a report
    thereon to the Congress. Such committees may rely on such
    techniques as pilot testing, analysis of costs in comparison with
    benefits, or provision for evaluation after a defined period of
    time.
    (b) Reports to the Senate and the House of Representatives
      In each odd-numbered year beginning on or after January 1, 1973,
    each standing committee of the Senate shall submit, not later than
    March 31, to the Senate, and each standing committee of the House
    shall submit, not later than January 2, to the House, a report on
    the activities of that committee under this section during the

    Sec. 190l. Private claims pending before Congress; taking of
      testimony

-STATUTE-
      Any committee of either House of Congress before which any
    private claim against the United States may at any time be pending,
    being first thereto authorized by the House appointing them, may
    order testimony to be taken, and books and papers to be examined,
    and copies thereof proved, before any standing master in chancery
    within the judicial district where such testimony or evidence is to
    be taken. Such master in chancery, upon receiving a copy of the
    order of such committee, signed by its chairman, setting forth the
    time and place when and where such examination is to be had, the
    questions to be investigated, and, so far as may be known to the
    committee, the names of the witnesses to be examined on the part of
    the United States, and the general nature of the books, papers, and
    documents to be proved, if known, shall proceed to give to such
    private parties reasonable notice of the time and place of such
    examination, unless such notice shall have been or shall be given
    by such committee or its chairman, or by the attorney or agent of
    the United States, or waived by such private party. And such master
    shall issue subpoenas for such witnesses as may have been named in
    the order of such committee, and such others as the agent or other
    representative of the United States hereinafter mentioned shall
    request. And he shall also issue subpoenas at the request of such
    private party, or parties, for such witnesses within such judicial
    district as they may desire: Provided, That the United States shall
    not be liable for the fees of any officer for serving any subpoena
    for any private party, nor for the fees of any witness on behalf of
    such party. Said committee may inform the United States attorney
    for the district where the testimony is to be taken of the time,
    place, and object of such examination, and request his attendance
    in behalf of the Government in conducting such examination, in
    which case it shall be his duty to attend in person, or by an
    assistant employed by him, to conduct such examination on the part
    of the United States, or such committee may, at its option, appoint
    an agent or attorney, or one of its own members, for that purpose,
    as they may deem best; and in that event, if the committee shall
    not be unanimous, the minority of the committee may also appoint
    such agent or attorney or member of such committee to attend and
    take part in such examination.

    "An act to provide for taking testimony, to be used before

      The original text referred to "any standing master in chancery of
    the circuit of the United States within the judicial district where
    such testimony or evidence is to be taken." The words "of the
    circuit of the United States" were omitted as inappropriate since
    the abolition of circuit courts by act Mar. 3, 1911.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 190m. Subpoena for taking testimony; compensation of officers
      and witnesses; return of depositions

-STATUTE-
      It shall be the duty of the marshal of the United States for the
    district in which the testimony is to be taken to serve, or cause
    to be served, all subpoenas issued in behalf of the United States
    under this section and section 190l of this title, in the same
    manner as if issued by the district court for his district; and he
    shall, upon being first paid his fees therefor, serve any subpoenas
    that may be issued at the instance of such private party or
    parties. And the said master may, in his discretion, appoint any
    other person to serve any subpoena. Such master shall have full
    power to administer oaths to witnesses, and the same power to issue
    attachments to compel the attendance of witnesses and the
    production of books, papers, and documents, as the district court
    of his district would have in a case pending before it; and it
    shall be his duty to report the conduct of contumacious witnesses
    before him to the House of Congress appointing such committee. The
    compensation of such master in chancery, and the fees of marshals
    and deputy marshals, and of any person appointed to serve papers,
    shall be the same as for like services in equity cases in the
    district court of the United States; and the compensation of
    witnesses shall be the same as for like attendance and travel of
    witnesses before such district courts; and all such fees and
    compensation of officers and witnesses on behalf of the United
    States, and other expenses of all investigations which may be had
    under the provisions of this section and section 190l of this title
    on the part of the United States, shall be paid out of the
    contingent fund of the Senate, in the case of a committee of the
    Senate, or the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives,
    in the case of a committee of the House of Representatives. Said
    master, when the examination is concluded, shall attach together
    all the depositions and exhibits, and attach thereto his
    certificate setting forth or referring to the authority by which
    they were taken, any notices he may have given, the names of the
    witnesses for whom subpoenas or attachments were issued, the names
    of witnesses who attended, with the time of attendance and mileage
    and fees of each witness on behalf of the United States, which he
    may require to be shown by affidavit, his own fees, the fees of the
    marshal, his deputies or other persons serving papers, giving the
    items, and such other facts in relation to the circumstances
    connected with the taking of the depositions as he may deem
    material. He shall then seal up such depositions and papers
    securely, direct them to the chairman of such committee at
    Washington, stating briefly on the outside the nature of the
    contents, and place the same in the post office, paying the postage
    thereon; and said package shall be opened only in the presence of
    such committee. The chairman of any committee ordering testimony to
    be taken under this section and section 190l of this title shall,
    at least ten days before the time fixed for such examination, and
    within two days after the adoption of such order, cause a copy
    thereof to be directed and delivered to the Attorney General of the
    United States, or sent to him by mail at the Department of Justice,
    to enable him to give such instructions as he may deem best to the
    United States attorney of the district where such testimony is to
    be taken, who may, and, if required by the Attorney General, shall,
    though not requested by the committee, appear for the United States
    in person or by assistant, and take such part in such examination
    as the Attorney General shall direct.
