                           INTRODUCTION

     1.   SCOPE.  The Department of Energy (DOE) requires that all Protective Force (PF) personnel
     [i.e., Federal Officers (FOs), Special Agents (SAs), and Security Police Officers (SPOs)]
     receive approved firearms training and pass approved firearms qualification courses for the
     firearms they are authorized to carry.  Training in the use of deadly force is provided by the
     DOE Safeguards and Security Central Training Academy (CTA) and the approved DOE Basic
     SPO Program.  DOE policy for the use of deadly force is promulgated in Title 10, Code of
     Federal Regulations (10 CFR), Part 1047, LIMITED ARREST AUTHORITY AND USE OF
     FORCE BY PF OFFICERS; it is not addressed herein.

    Firearms qualification courses described in this Manual are approved by the Office of
  Safeguards and Security (OSS) for firearms qualification and requalification to ensure PF
  personnel are uniformly qualified with the firearms they are authorized to carry.  The courses
  evaluate basic shooting skills with various authorized firearms.  Additional requirements for
  firearms training and qualifications are set forth in 10 CFR PART 1046, PHYSICAL
  PROTECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS, and DOE O 473.2, PROTECTIVE FORCE
  PROGRAM.  

    The courses promulgated herein address the 10 CFR 1046 requirement that PF personnel have
  the minimum level of skills and knowledge needed to competently perform all essential functions
  associated with PF job responsibilities.  These courses evaluate PF personnel competency to
  defend against the DOE Design Basis Threat (U).  

    Site-specific conditions and deployment of firearms may justify requirements for developing and
  implementing supplementary special firearms training and qualification courses (e.g., aerial firing
  platforms, executive protection, vehicle mounted weapons).  Where this Manual does not
  contain a course(s) applicable to a site-specific deployment of firearms, then such
  supplementary courses must be developed and submitted to the Director, OSS, for review and
  concurrence.  All firearms courses must be conducted in accordance with DOE O 440.1A,
  WORKER PROTECTION MANAGEMENT FOR DOE FEDERAL AND
  CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES, and this Manual.

    PF personnel must demonstrate acceptable marksmanship and proficiency in related shooting
  skills in order to pass the firearms qualification courses.  Shooting skills include the ability to aim
  and fire accurately; manipulate firearms; draw, shoot, and reload quickly and effectively; and
  assume realistic shooting positions.  Periodic training must supplement all courses promulgated
  in this Manual.  Shooting skills can be enhanced by training and testing knowledge, skills, and
  abilities, as appropriate (e.g., firearm manipulation; target discrimination; the engagement of
  moving, multiple, and reactive targets; and shooting under stress).

    The firearms qualification courses prescribed in this Manual may be used for training and must
  be used to determine whether PF personnel are qualified to be armed with a particular firearm. 
  The ability of PF personnel to pass a firearm qualification course will, in part, depend on the
  quality of periodic training and the degree of proficiency achieved by the individual PF member
  in various shooting skills.  Firearms training is not the subject of this Manual.  All firearms
  qualification courses must be conducted by firearms instructors certified by the CTA for
  instruction in the various firearms used during the specific courses.  (For example, a submachine
  gun Qualification Course must be conducted by an instructor certified at the Advanced
  Weapons Systems Instructor Certification level.)

     2.   APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.  The requirements in 10 CFR Part 1046, PHYSICAL
     PROTECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS, address medical and physical fitness as well as
     firearms training, qualification, and requalification for PF personnel.  Firearms training,
     qualification, and requalification requirements are also addressed in DOE O 473.2,
     PROTECTIVE FORCE PROGRAM.  The provisions in 10 CFR Part 1047, LIMITED
     ARREST AUTHORITY AND USE OF FORCE BY PROTECTIVE FORCE OFFICERS,
     include DOE policy on the use of deadly force.  The promulgated courses are conducted in
     accordance with DOE O 440.1A.

     3.   CONTENT.  This Manual devotes separate chapters to basic courses of fire for five types of
     firearms:  handgun, rifle, shotgun, submachine gun (SMG), and light machine gun (LMG). 
     Three specialized groups of courses (1) shooting-on-the-move, (2) precision rifle, and (3)
     live-fire-shoot house (LFSH) are also addressed by separate chapters.
       
    All courses are executed under daylight conditions with selected courses also being fired under
  reduced lighting conditions.

          Attachment 1 to this Manual provides requirements for lighting standards and
     measurement techniques.

          Attachment 2 sets forth the remedial qualification course.  

          Attachment 3 provides target specifications and scoring details and requirements. 

          Attachment 4 contains descriptions of scoring templates used during Precision Rifle
     Qualification Courses.  

          Attachment 5 contains definitions pertinent to the DOE PF Firearms Program and this
     Manual.  

          Attachment 6 is the Contractors Requirements Document (CRD) for this Manual.
 
     4.   REVIEW.  This Manual must be reviewed annually by the OSS Firearms Quality Panel, which
     may recommend changes.  Field elements are encouraged to forward written recommendations
     for changes or comments, with sufficient detail for consideration by DOE Headquarters, to the
     Director, OSS. 
                            CHAPTER II

     GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSES

The following general instructions must be followed during firearms qualification courses:

    Shooters must maintain silence on the line so they can hear and interpret range commands.  
    All range commands or questions to the line must be issued by the lead instructor.  

    Shooters must not move off the line or pick up any equipment or brass until the line is declared
  safe and the line is told to act by the lead instructor.

    Shooters on line must commence firing on command only.  Shooters must cease fire
  immediately when commanded to do so.  

    A shooter on line holding a firearm must always maintain the muzzle pointed down-range.

    Shooters must fire all rounds center of mass of the target presented to them, unless otherwise
  directed.

    Shooters must always wear approved sight and hearing protection.

    Shooters must touch the trigger only when aiming the sights at the target.  Until then, the shooter
  must keep his/her trigger finger extended straight alongside the receiver or frame.

    Shooters must not attempt to catch brass or to eject brass into collection containers.

    Shooters must reload using ammunition pouches, speed loaders, magazines, or magazine
  pouches that are provided and/or worn on duty.  Pouches or carriers that require snaps or
  other closures must be in the snapped or closed position prior to initiation of a stage.

    The lead instructor must ensure the firing line is clear of debris (e.g., magazines, brass,
  ammunition boxes) and equipment to prevent injury to shooters moving from one position or
  distance to another.

    Shooters must always apply the prescribed immediate action or malfunction clearing procedure
  to a firearm that fails to fire.  The only exception to this requirement is during the LFSH
  Qualification Course, when the shooter is required to transition from the handgun to the SMG
  when a malfunction occurs.

    If a shooter experiences a malfunction during a course, he/she must attempt to clear that
  malfunction using proper clearing methods.  If the shooter properly clears the malfunction, an
  alibi must be provided.

    An alibi must be provided if a condition occurs that cannot be cleared by standard clearing
  procedures.

    Shooters with an alibi must be allowed to complete a string.

    Adjustable sights on all non-individually assigned firearms must be set in a standard manner so
  all shooters know the point of impact and can make aiming adjustments quickly and consistently
  to permit accurate initial fire.

    The lead instructor may authorize firearms or magazines to be fully loaded, unless otherwise
  specified, for all stages/strings; however, the shooter must clear the chamber between stages
  when the next stage begins at a half-load.

    Shooters using a firearm equipped with a selector lever must ensure it is returned to the safe
  position after every string unless otherwise directed by the lead instructor.

    Shooters must place a shoulder-fired firearm to the shoulder and align the sights with the target
  for every string, unless the stage specifies another position (i.e., the low-ready).

    The lead instructor must allow the use of illumination devices affixed to firearms when
  prescribed in the course.

    When required, shooters must use only flashlights that are approved for and carried on duty. 
  These flashlights must have a pressure switch that turns the flashlight on when pressed and that
  turns the flashlight off when released.

    When firing for qualification, SPOs, according to SPO Level, must wear all minimum equipment
  required by DOE O 473.2 and site-specific instructions for duty and tactical responses.

                           CHAPTER III

                  HANDGUN QUALIFICATION COURSES

     1.   INTRODUCTION.  The Handgun qualification courses evaluate shooters' marksmanship and
     firearm manipulation under daylight and reduced lighting conditions.  The stages test various
     shooting techniques under specified conditions and through specified procedures.  The DOE
     Standard Target must be used for all stages and scored in accordance with Attachment 3. 
     Lighting standards for the Reduced Lighting Handgun Qualification Course are specified in
     Attachment 1 and must be followed strictly whenever a shooter is to be qualified.

     2.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDGUN QUALIFICATION COURSES.

          All general instructions for firearms qualification courses in Chapter II apply.

          All draws must be from a snapped or secured holster.  Shooters must start with their
     hands relaxed, hanging by their sides.

          Shooters must decock double-action semiautomatics before holstering.

          Shooters authorized to carry a semiautomatic pistol while on duty must decock after
     each string, and the first round must be fired double-action if the pistol is equipped with
     a decocking device.  If firing a revolver, all rounds must be fired double-action.
    
          The kneeling position may incorporate support for the shooting hand, but at least one
     knee must touch the ground.  Other positions may incorporate support for the shooting
     hand as directed.

          Shooters, when required to fire from either the right or left side of the barricade, must
     use the barricade for cover.  Shooters must also use the barricade as cover when
     reloading.

          An approved flashlight must be used during Stages II and III of the Reduced Lighting
     Handgun Qualification Course.

                  RIFLE QUALIFICATION COURSES

     1.   INTRODUCTION.  The courses of fire for the rifle evaluate shooters' marksmanship and
     firearm manipulation under daylight and reduced lighting conditions.  The prescribed stages of
     fire test various shooting techniques under specified conditions and through specified
     procedures.  The DOE Standard Target must be used for all stages and scored in accordance
     with Attachment 3.  Lighting standards for the Reduced Lighting Rifle Qualification Course are
     specified in Attachment 1 and must be followed strictly whenever a shooter is to be qualified.

2.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR RIFLE QUALIFICATION COURSES.

          All general instructions for firearms qualification courses in Chapter II apply.

          Rifle slings may be used, but must remain loose until the command to commence firing
     for each string of fire.  For example, a hasty sling may be adopted after the command to
     commence firing.

          Carbines authorized for duty may include 9mm, .45 caliber, and other bore sizing
     designed to fire handgun cartridges.

          SPOs armed for duty with a rifle or carbine capable of firing in the semiautomatic, full-
     automatic, or 3-round burst mode must fire a qualification course for each setting.

          All strings must start from the standing low-ready position, half-load configuration
     unless specified otherwise.

          Shooters must place the selector lever to the safe position after every string.

             LIGHT MACHINE GUN QUALIFICATION COURSES

     1.   INTRODUCTION.  Courses for the light machine gun (LMG) evaluate and test a gunner's
     marksmanship and firearm manipulation under daylight conditions for the authorized LMG,
     which has been assigned to that gunner.  The stages test various manipulation and shooting
     techniques under specified conditions and through specified procedures; the stages also test the
     gunner's mastery of proven techniques that exploit the firepower of the LMG and ensure its
     effective operation.  Distances must be measured in meters.  Standard Military 10-Meter
     Targets must be used for all stages and scored in accordance with Attachment 3.

     2.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIGHT MACHINE GUN QUALIFICATION COURSES.

          All general instructions for firearms qualification courses in Chapter II apply.

          Firearms instructors must ensure gunners achieve a correct half-load condition during
     stages requiring that condition.

          A malfunctioning LMG must be replaced immediately if it is apparent that general
     malfunction clearing procedures will not remedy the problem.

          On M-60s, the gunner must ease the bolt forward during assembly, disassembly, and
     function check to prevent damage to the feed tray assembly and operating-rod
     assembly.  A gunner must not close the feed tray cover with the bolt forward to avoid
     damage to parts of the feed tray cover and the bolt.

          On Heckler and Koch (HK) LMGs, the gunner must perform the function check
     without an ammunition box mounted.

          On HKs in the half-load configuration, the gunner must ensure a round is present over
     the cartridge feed lever before closing the belt-feed unit.

          For both the M-60 and the HK, a gunner must qualify in the LMG Manipulation
     Qualification Course before being allowed to fire the LMG Qualification Course.

           SHOOTING-ON-THE-MOVE QUALIFICATION COURSES

     1.   INTRODUCTION.  The Shooting-on-the-Move Qualification Courses evaluate a shooter's
     marksmanship and manipulation skills while moving in a tactical environment under daylight
     conditions.  The stages and time limits simulate realistic requirements during dynamic
     engagements with lethal adversaries delineated in the DOE Design Basis Threat.  Targets and
     scoring for these courses must comply with Attachment 3.

    NOTE:  These courses are designed to address the skills necessary for CQB situations.  In the
  event that a site has chosen to equip its Special Response Team with a rifle with full and/or
  semiautomatic fire capabilities instead of a SMG for CQB operations, the Shooting-on-the-
  Move SMG Qualification Course must still be used to assess shooters' skills. When such rifles
  are capable of semiautomatic fire only, the applicable procedure for Stages II, IV, and V of the
  Shooting-on-the-Move SMG Qualification Course must be utilized.  Required SMG
  qualification scoring percentages must be maintained

2.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHOOTING-ON-THE-MOVE QUALIFICATION COURSES.

          All general instructions for firearms qualification courses in Chapter II apply, except
     when immediate action fails to remove the cause of a malfunctioning firearm.  In that
     event, shooters on-the-move or stationary must not attempt to fire, but must
     perform any required movements and wait until the end of a string for a firearms
     instructor to determine an alibi.

          Shooters must be qualified in the Daylight Handgun and Daylight SMG Qualification
     Courses before they may participate in the corresponding Shooting-on-the-Move
     Qualification Course.

          Shooters must ensure that their firearms are in a full-load condition at the beginning of
     each stage of fire, except for the following:

            - Shooters armed with a revolver must load 2 rounds in the cylinder in a position
       to ensure the initial rotation will fire the first round when a stage requires speed
       loading.

            - Shooters armed with a semiautomatic handgun must load 2 rounds with one
       chambered and one in the magazine (full-load condition) when a stage requires
       speed loading.

          Shooters must begin the stage that requires a transition to the handgun as a back-up
     with the handgun holstered in a full-load condition.

          SPO-IIIs must fire these courses for qualification wearing the equipment required for
     duty during tactical response situations.

          Shooters must use an approved protective mask during Stages I and II of the Shooting-
     on-the-Move Handgun and SMG Qualification Courses.

          Shooters must fire all rounds on-the-move as required.  Rounds fired from a stationary
     position when they should be fired on-the-move will be deducted, at full value, from the
     total score.

          Shooters, when applicable, must maintain the SMG/rifle on their person while firing the
     Shooting-on-the-Move Handgun Qualification Course.

                            CHAPTER X

            LIVE-FIRE SHOOT HOUSE QUALIFICATION COURSE
                                                         
   1. INTRODUCTION.  The LFSH Qualification Course evaluates a shooter's marksmanship,
   firearms manipulation, decision-making ability, and tactical entry skills.  The course element
   simulates realistic requirements during dynamic engagements with lethal adversaries delineated in the
   DOE Design Basis Threat.  

    The shooter is accompanied, throughout the course, by a certified SPO-III, whose skills have been
  verified by the LFSH Instructor.  The SPO-III acts as the shooter's team member to enhance realism. 
  Additionally, a Control Instructor follows the shooter to control the shooter's execution of the course
  and movements.  The Instructor-in-Charge is stationed in an elevated observation/control platform to
  oversee and control the entire course.  Together, the two instructors and the SPO-III provide
  complete observation, positive control, and detailed evaluation of the shooter.  Target descriptions and
  scoring instructions are set forth in Attachment 3.  The LFSH Qualification Course differs from other
  firearms qualification courses in that it consists of only one stage.

    With safety being a paramount concern while shooting in confined spaces, both the LFSH and the
  firing procedure ensure safety for all participants.  In the interest of safety, among other measures,
  certain walls of the LFSH are constructed to prevent ricochets and penetrations, as outlined in the
  DOE Firearms Range Design Guide.  To further ensure safety, only one shooter is evaluated
  (participates) at a time during the conduct of the LFSH Qualification Course.

NOTE: This course is designed to address the skills necessary for CQB situations.  In the event that a
site has chosen to equip its SPO-IIIs with a rifle with full and/or semiautomatic fire capabilities instead
of a SMG for CQB operations, the LFSH Qualification Course must still be used to assess shooters'
skills.  When such rifles are only capable of firing semiautomatic fire the applicable procedure for that
stage of the LFSH Qualification Course must apply.  Required LFSH qualification scoring percentages
must be maintained. 

2. INSTRUCTIONS FOR LFSH QUALIFICATION COURSE.

          All general instructions for firearms qualification courses in Chapter II apply, except in the area
     of clearing malfunctions, which require a transition from the SMG/rifle to the handgun.

          The course must be administered by instructors who have successfully completed the SPO-III
     Instructor Certification Course conducted by the CTA and must be implemented in
     accordance with the requirements and procedures established within the SPO-III Certification
     Program.

          The course must be fired only when the Instructor-in-Charge, the Control Instructor, and the
     SPO-III accompanying the shooter are all present and in their respective assigned positions.

          All shooters must receive, in addition to the general firearms/range safety briefing, a specific
     LFSH Qualification Course Safety Briefing focusing on particular course requirements.

          Shooters must be SPO-IIIs or SPO-IIs undergoing SPO-III training.

          The shooter must begin the course on the first command to "Execute."

          The shooter must be evaluated and scored on (1) correct performance of required course
     procedures and (2) completion of the course within the site-specific time limit.  Shooters may
     accumulate up to 5 procedural errors and must complete the course within the specified time or
     less, in order to qualify.

          The time limit will be determined and validated by the physical characteristics of the site's
     LFSH (e.g., the CTA's LFSH time limit is 45 seconds).

          The shooter must fail the course for any one of the following reasons:

            - failing to clear a room in the prescribed order;

            - rounds on a target with a prohibited strike anywhere other than the head, when head
       shots only are required;

            - missing the picture or target backing with any fired rounds;

            - failing to engage a "shoot" target;

            - exceeding the course time limit;

            - dropping a loaded firearm to the ground;

            - allowing a SMG/rifle with a round chambered and without the selector switch being
       placed to the safe position, to hang by the sling;

            - failing to complete the course within the specified time limit;

            - accumulating 6 or more procedural errors;

            - shooting at a "no-shoot" target;

            - causing a round to print within or cut the prohibited strike zone on a "shoot" target;

            - demonstrating a blatant disregard for safety;

            - failing to move the selector lever to the safe position after experiencing a malfunction of
       the SMG/rifle.

          A shooter experiencing a malfunction of the SMG/rifle must transition to the handgun
     immediately and complete the course, even if the malfunction occurs before the mandatory
     transition point.

          The shooter must fire at all "shoot" targets while moving.

          The shooter must transition from the SMG/rifle to the handgun.

   3. LFSH COURSE LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS.  The LFSH layout must allow for variations for
   entry points, target placement, and room configuration to preclude repetitiveness and memorization
   of the course.  The following layout requirements must be in place for the LFSH Qualification
   Course to be conducted:

          three separate rooms for entry, one of which must be on the opposite side of the hall from the
     other two;

          at least two targets that do not present a lethal threat ("no-shoot" target);

          five targets presenting lethal threats ("shoot" targets), two of which require firing rounds to the
     head of the target (one for the SMG and one for the handgun);

          in each room, at least three ballistic walls allowing a 180-degree area for firing.

          there must be at least three different LFSH layouts incorporating different "shoot" and "no-
     shoot" target placements, and where possible, incorporating different entry points and room
     configurations.  

      NOTE:  The LFSH Qualification Course must not be conducted on the same layout during
   consecutive semi-annual qualification attempts.
                                          
4. LFSH QUALIFICATION COURSE.

      Technique:  Tactical response to lethal threats requiring constant movement, precision
   marksmanship, correct firearm manipulation, demonstration of correct room clearing 
   procedures, and target identification.

          REDUCED LIGHTING STANDARDS AND MEASUREMENTS
               FOR FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSES

   1. INTRODUCTION.  Two reduced lighting standards are used in certain DOE firearms qualification
   courses.  The following requirements establish the need for reduced lighting standards:

          to ensure that all reduced light qualification courses are conducted in a consistent manner; 

          to provide as realistic as possible reduced lighting conditions that Protective Force (PF)
     personnel may experience at exterior security posts and other less illuminated areas on a
     facility; 

          to allow for a consistent condition in which PF personnel are required to use a flashlight to
     satisfactorily identify and engage a perceived threat; and 

          to meet the above requirements while providing sufficient illumination for safe skills evaluation
     and instructor control.

2. LIGHTING STANDARDS.  The two lighting standards are as follows.

          a.  Dim Light.  The Dim Light Standard equates to a measurement of .2 foot-candle.

          b.  Dark Light.  The Dark Standard equates to a measurement of less than .2 foot-candle.  The
       use of a flashlight is mandatory during qualification course stages fired at the Dark Standard.

   3. LIGHTING STANDARDS MEASUREMENT AND APPLICATION.  Both lighting standards
   must be determined by using a calibrated light meter and taking light measurements from the target
   face while directing the receptor portion of the meter toward the light source.  Care should be taken
   to ensure that the body does not shield any light source from the receptor during this measurement
   to ensure an accurate measurement.  

      Normal Dim Light and Dark Light Standards measurements may be exceeded provided the cause
   of the excess is due solely to a natural condition such as moonlight or starlight.  However, no
   reduced lighting qualification course may be fired if a measurement exceeds .2 foot candle due to
   dawn, dusk, or artificial illumination.
                                                           
              REMEDIAL FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSE

   1. INTRODUCTION.  The purpose of the Remedial Firearms Qualification Course is to help
   Protective Force (PF) personnel who fail to qualify in a particular firearms qualification course.  The
   course is scheduled as needed, includes daylight and reduced lighting range conditions, and is
   administered by DOE-certified firearms instructors.  Firearms instructors endeavor to review
   available firearms qualification documentation and focus instruction on previously identified problem
   areas for individual shooters while reinforcing the principles of marksmanship, firearms
   manipulation, and safety in accordance with approved instruction plans for PF personnel.

   2. INSTRUCTIONS FOR REMEDIAL FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSE.

          a.  The course must consist of two phases, each of which must be no more than 4 hours long. 
       Phase I must address the basic fundamentals of marksmanship, beginning with dry-firing
       exercises, advancing to live fire practice, and culminating in a qualification attempt.  Should the
       shooter fail the Phase I qualification attempt, Phase II must address the shooting defect(s)
       identified during Phase I and culminate in a second qualification attempt.  Phase II will not be
       required if Phase I culminates in a successful qualification attempt.

          b.  Firearms instructors must provide one-on-one instruction, require correct demonstration of
       shooting techniques through dry fire exercises before permitting live fire practice, and carefully
       analyze all results with the shooter to remedy the identified problem(s).

          c.  Firearms instructors must document course progress, to include identification of the shooter's
       problem(s), remedial action(s), and the number of rounds expended to correct the problem(s).

          d.  Firearms instructors must assist shooters to ensure the correct sighting of a firearm, should it be
       questioned; verify sighting, if required; and resolve any question prior to live fire qualification
       practice.

          e.  Shooters must be permitted to slowly fire a specified number of rounds for live fire qualification
       practice from the position(s) or employing the technique(s) determined to have occasioned the
       problem(s).

          f.  Shooters must be allowed to attempt the applicable firearms qualification course following the
       live-fire qualification practices, with less than 4 hours of remedial training, subject to the
       concurrence of the shooter.

          g.  Shooters are required to attempt the applicable firearms qualification course in order to
       complete Phase I of this course.

          h.  Shooters are required to attempt the applicable firearms qualification course, following
       completion of each phase of Remedial Firearms Qualification Course.

          i.  A shooter must complete Phase II within 30 days of initial entry into the Remedial Firearms
       Qualification Course, should the shooter fail the applicable firearms qualification course during
       Phase I.

          k.  A shooter successfully completing the applicable firearms qualification course must be returned
       to a full duty status.

          l.  A shooter who fails to qualify after Phase II training loses his/her SPO status and must be
       disarmed, per the requirements of 10 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1046, Appendix B,
       Paragraph (9)j.

   3. REMEDIAL FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSE.  The applicable firearms qualification
   course must be conducted in accordance with this Manual.  It must be preceded by the
   announcement:  "This is a qualification run for score."                                
   TARGETS AND SCORING FOR DOE FIREARMS QUALIFICATION COURSES

   1. INTRODUCTION.  Target descriptions and scoring methods for different firearms and
   qualification courses are set forth below.

   2. TARGETS.  

          a.  The DOE Standard Target must be used for all firearms qualification courses except the Light
       Machine Gun (LMG) and Live-fire Shoot House (LFSH) Qualification Courses.  This target
       closely replicates an average-sized human form and provides scoring rings for center of mass
       and head shots, contrast to assist sighting, a line 8 inches below the top of the head (neckline),
       and a choice of green, blue, and grey colors.  The target design accommodates adaptation to
       varying courses.

          b.  A reduced-size DOE Standard Target is available to simulate firing from 50 and 100 yards
       when actually firing from the 25- and 50-yard line, respectively.  This reduced target is scored
       the same way as the full size target.

          c.  The Standard Military 10-Meter Target is used for LMG Qualification Courses.

          d.  The LFSH Qualification Course requires picture targets that replicate or accommodate the
       center of mass and head scoring areas/scoring rings of a DOE Standard Target.  Should the
       picture targets not display the required center of mass and head scoring rings, the scoring
       templates in Attachment 4 must be used to replicate the standard scoring area.

   3. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCORING DOE STANDARD TARGET.  Regardless of size, targets
   must be scored as follows.

          a.  Handgun, Rifle, Submachine Gun (SMG).

                 (1)    Center of mass scoring ring, when specified by the course:

                   (a)  A projectile print within or cutting the inner ring is 5 points.
                   (b)  A projectile print between the inner and outer ring is 4 points.
                   (c)  A projectile print outside the outer ring but within or cutting the silhouette is 3
            points.

                 (2)    Head scoring ring, when specified by the course:

                   (a)  A projectile print within or cutting the scoring ring is 5 points.
                   (b)  A projectile print outside the scoring ring, but within or cutting the silhouette,
            provided it is at the neck line, is 3 points.
                   (c)  A projectile failing to print within or cut the head silhouette at the neckline is 0
            points.

          (3) Other Considerations:

                 (a)    A projectile cutting the line of a higher ring value receives the higher value.
                 (b)    When course procedures permit and head shots are required, attempted head shots
            should be marked before progressing to the next stage.
                 (c)    The initial edge of impact must determine the value of a projectile that strikes a target,
            making a slashing cut, as the target is turning.

       b. Shotgun.  When the DOE Standard Target is scored for the Shotgun Qualification Courses, any
     projectile printing on or cutting the silhouette of the human form must be one point.

       c. Precision Rifle.  When the DOE Standard Target is scored for the Precision Rifle Qualification
     Courses, the following rules apply.

          (1) Head:

              Use the head scoring template in Attachment 4 to score the head shot holes.
              A projectile print within or cutting the inner ring is scored 5 points.
              A projectile print within or cutting the middle ring is scored 4 points.
              A projectile print within or cutting the outer ring is scored 2 points.
              A projectile print outside the outer ring is scored 0 points.

          (2) Center of Mass:

              Use the center of mass scoring template in Attachment 4 to score the center of mass
       shot holes.
              A projectile print within or cutting the inner ring is scored 5 points.
              A projectile print within or cutting the middle ring is scored 4 points.
              A projectile print within or cutting the outer ring is scored 2 points.
              A projectile print outside the outer ring is scored 0 points.

          (3) Disqualification:

              A projectile failing to print on the silhouette constitutes an automatic failure.
              On stages VIII and IX of the Daylight Precision Rifle Qualification Course, a projectile
       failing to print on the reduced strike zone constitutes an automatic failure.

   4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCORING STANDARD MILITARY TARGET.  Targets used for
   LMG Qualification Courses use only the tombstone scoring area, which must be scored as follows.

          a.  A projectile print within or cutting the tombstone scoring area is 1 point.
          b.  A projectile print outside the tombstone scoring area is 0 points.

                 (1)    Scoring Hits, Misses, and Disqualifiers.

                   (a)  Picture target presenting a lethal threat, or a "shoot" target:
     
                                  A projectile that prints within or cuts the scoring rings of the center of
                 mass or head must be a hit if it does not print within or cut a prohibited
                 strike zone.

                                  A projectile printing within or cutting a prohibited strike zone must be a
                 disqualifier.

                                  A projectile printing within the outline of the human form pictured, but
                 not within or cutting a scoring ring and not within or cutting a prohibited
                 strike zone, must be scored as a miss.  For a target that should be
                 engaged with rounds to the head only, any projectile printing within or
                 cutting the standard center of mass scoring area must be scored as a
                 miss.

                                  A projectile failing to print anywhere on the target or its backing must
                 be a disqualifier.

                                                                                         (b)  Picture target presenting no lethal threat or a "no-shoot" target:    

                                  Any projectile directed at the target, whether the projectile fails to print
                 or prints anywhere on the picture or target backing, is a disqualifier.

                   (c)  Hallway picture target presenting a lethal threat:

                                  A projectile printing anywhere within the outline of the human form
                 pictured must be scored as a hit.

                                  A projectile printing anywhere outside the outline of the human form,
                 including on the target backing, must be scored as a miss.

                                  A projectile failing to print anywhere on the target or its backing must
                 be a disqualifier.

                 (2)    Scoring Procedural Errors.  One procedural error will be assessed for each
            occurrence of the following:

                        failure to maintain a constant speed (pace) throughout the course, which permits
            the accurate engagement of "shoot" targets;

                        engaging a "shoot" target from a stationary position;

                        failure to perform the correct crossover maneuver in a room;

                        failure to maintain the correct low-ready position when required;

                        failure to transition to the handgun without hesitation whenever a transition is
            required;

                                        failure to correctly engage "shoot" targets.  The SMG/rifle, fired on automatic,
                    requires 4 rounds and 4 hits to the center of mass and 2 rounds and 2 hits to
                    the head.  The SMG/rifle, fired on semiautomatic, requires 2 rounds and 2 hits
                    to the center of mass and 1 round and 1 hit to the head.  The handgun requires
                    2 rounds and 2 hits to the center of mass and 1 round and 1 hit to the head;

                        failure to correctly engage "shoot" targets masked by a prohibited strike zone.  
            The SMG/rifle, fired on automatic, requires 2 rounds and 2 hits to the head.; 
            The SMG/rifle, fired on semiautomatic, requires 1 round and 1 hit to the head. 
            The handgun requires 1 round and 1 hit to the head.  

                        expending more than 2 rounds in a single burst of fire with the SMG/rifle, while
            firing on automatic;

                        failure to correctly move through a door without hesitation;

                        failure to immediately clear and move to the near corner;

                        failure to run the second wall;

                        failure to correctly clear the room to the center;

                        failure to correctly announce status and intention;

                        a projectile failing to print within or cut the pictured human form on the hallway
            shoot target;

                        a projectile printing somewhere on a "shoot" target backing, but not within or
            cutting the pictured human form.

          NOTE:  SHOOTERS ACCUMULATING MORE THAN 6 PROCEDURAL
     ERRORS MUST FAIL TO QUALIFY.
