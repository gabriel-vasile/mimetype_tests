                                BODY MEASUREMENTS                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Body measurements were recorded for all examinees by a trained             
     examiner in the mobile examination center (MEC).  The protocol for this    
     component did not detail any medical, safety or other exclusions.          
                                                                                
     The body measurements examination included measures of weight, standing    
     height, lengths, skinfolds, circumferences, and breadths.  In              
     cases when examinees had to leave the MEC early and were unable            
     to participate in the complete body measures component, at a               
     minimum, weight and standing height or recumbent length were               
     measured.                                                                  
                                                                                
     Persons aged under one year or 20 years and over who were examined only    
     in their homes were given a subset of the body measures.  These measures   
     were taken by trained technicians who used equipment and procedures        
     comparable to those used in the mobile examination centers.  Therefore,    
     the home examination body measures were incorporated into the body         
     measures data set.                                                         
                                                                                
     To determine which subjects were home examinees, the DMPSTAT               
     variable (3=home-examined) should be used.  When analyzing data            
     for combined home-examined and MEC-examined subjects, the                  
     combined MEC- plus home-examined sample weights should be used             
     (WTPFHX6).  When using only MEC items or measures, the MEC                 
     examination sample weight should be used (WTPFEX6).  For more              
     information on the use of sample weights in the NHANES III data            
     analysis, refer to the Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S.             
     DHHS, 1996b).                                                              
                                                                                
     The following are the names shown on the Home Examination form in the      
     Plan and Operation of the Third National Health and Nutrition              
     Examination Survey, 1988-1994 (original home exam variable name; new       
     name) for home examination body measures (NCHS, 1994, p. 313; U.S. DHHS,   
     1996b).  In the home exam, the only body measures taken were weight (A1;   
     BMPWT), standing height (A2; BMPHT), arm circumference (A6; BMPARMCI),     
     and triceps skinfold (A5; BMPTRI). For infants aged less than one year,    
     recumbent length (A3; BMPRECUM) was measured instead of stature, and       
     head circumference (A4; BMPHEAD) was added.  For examinees who received    
     only a home examination, the measures listed above are the only body       
     measures available for analysis.  Values for all other body measures for   
     these examinees appear as blank.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data are considered a part          
     of body measurements and have been included with the body                  
     measurement data.  However, the BIA resistance and reactance               
     measures were recorded by the physicians in the physician's                
     examination component, hence the "PEP" variable prefix.                    
                                                                                
     For general guidelines on standard procedures that were followed           
     for the anthropometric measures, refer to The Anthropometric               
     Standardization Reference Manual (Lohman, 1988).  For specific             
     guidelines, the Anthropometric Procedures Video that demonstrates          
     the NHANES III anthropometric procedures in detail is available            
     from the U.S. Government Printing Office (U.S. DHHS, 1996a).               
                                                                                
     The MEC health technicians, ultrasonographers, dentists, and home          
     examination health technicians were trained by two trainers to do          
     the anthropometric measurements.  The two trainers were                    
     cross-standardized initially and then annually during the survey.          
     Group retraining occurred twice during the survey.  Periodic               
     visits to the field by each of the trainers assured ongoing                
     quality control in the accuracy and reliability of the                     
     procedures.                                                                
                                                                                
     This data set includes body measurements for women who were                
     pregnant at the time of the exam.  Analysts should determine               
     whether it is appropriate to exclude data for these women for a            
     given analysis.  Pregnancy status information is found in the              
     variable MAPF12R in the MEC Adult Questionnaire and in the                 
     variable MYPC17 in the MEC Youth Questionnaire.                            
                                                                                
     During the editing process, outliers were scrutinized using                
     univariate and multivariate methods to help identify implausible           
     values.  When there was insufficient information to conclude that          
     values were invalid, they were left in the data set.  Analysts             
     should examine the data spread and consider whether it is                  
     appropriate to include or exclude extreme values in a given                
     analysis.                                                                  
                                                                                
     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal              
     data consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables

     BMPBMI:  Body mass index                                                   
                                                                                
          BMPBMI was computed from weight and standing height using the         
          following formula:  BMPBMI=BMPWT/((BMPHT/100)**2).

          Weight, standing height, and recumbent length are fundamental         
          body measures essential to most analyses of other health              
          examination data.  Therefore, during data editing, a special          
          procedure was established and followed only for those three           
          variables when the primary measures were missing.  This               
          procedure allowed available alternate source data to be               
          substituted for missing primary source data.  In selected             
          cases, when data were absent from the primary health                  
          examination, the source of the substitution is indicated by a         
          derived indicator (flag) variable (i.e., BMPWTFLG, BMPHTFLG,          
          BMPRECFL).  These substitutions were derived from tests on            
          the actual data and evaluated and selected using cross-               
          validations on the actual data; they yielded satisfactory             
          results with R-squared values and correlations.  The flag             
          values range from 00 to 06, and corresponding interpretations         
          of these flag codes have been summarized as follows:

          BMPSRHIS is a derived variable that converts reported height in       
          feet and inches to total inches.  It is equal to the reported         
          height in feet multiplied by 12 plus the reported height in inches.   
                                                                                
          All NHANES III participants were asked to report their current        
          height in feet and inches and their weight in pounds.  Reported       
          height (BMPSRHIS) and weight (BMPSRWL) information was obtained       
          from adolescents (aged 12 through 16 years) during the body           
          measures component just prior to the actual measurement of            
          weight (BMPWT) and height (BMPHT).  For examinees of all other        
          ages, data for similar reported values can be found in the            
          Household Adult Questionnaire among persons aged over 17              
          years for height (HAM5S) and weight (HAM6S) and in the                
          Household Youth Questionnaire among persons aged less than            
          12 years for height (HYB18S) and weight (HYB19S).  Note that          
          in the data editing process some unusual values for reported          
          height were observed. For persons aged 12 through 16 years,           
          values less than 3 feet were deleted and recoded as "Blank            
          but applicable" (8888).

     BMPSUB, BMPSUP, BMPTHI, BMPTRI:  Skinfolds                                 
                                                                                
          For NHANES III, the body measurements protocol specified              
          that skinfolds would be measured at four different anatomic           
          body sites.  Independent measures were taken at each body             
          site by two technicians, resulting in a minimum of two                
          skinfold observations for each site.                                  
                                                                                
                                                                               
          If the difference between the two measurements at a given             
          site was within a pre-specified tolerance limit, no further           
          measurements were taken at that site.  The tolerance limits           
          increased by 2 mm for every 10 mm measured.  For the first two        
          measures, the first measure represents the base.  Thus, from 0-10     
          mm, observations were acceptable if they differed from the base       
          measurement by 2 mm or less; from 10-20 mm, observations were         
          acceptable if they differed from the base measurement by 4 mm or      
          less; from 20-30 mm, observations were acceptable if they differed    
          from the base measurement by 6 mm or less, and so on.  If             
          the difference between the two measurements at a given site           
          did exceed the tolerance limit, each technician repeated and          
          recorded a second measurement, resulting in a total of four           
          measurements at that skinfold site.                                   
                                                                                
          The summary skinfold values were computed as follows:                 
                                                                                
          If data were available for the third and fourth measurements          
          and the difference between those measurements was within the          
          specified tolerance limit, then the summary value was the             
          mean of the third and fourth measurements.  In all other              
          cases, the summary value was the mean of all available                
          skinfold measurements at that site.                                   
                                                                                
          Tolerance:  Tolerance was defined using the base skinfold measure.    
          For the third and fourth measures, the third measure represents the   
          base.                                                                 
                                                                                
          If base >  0 and base <= 10 then tolerance is 2 mm                    
          If base > 10 and base <= 20 then tolerance is 4 mm                    
          If base > 20 and base <= 30 then tolerance is 6 mm                    
          If base > 30 and base <= 40 then tolerance is 8 mm                    
          If base > 40 then tolerance is 10 mm.                                 
                                                                                
          This approach resulted in a single skinfold value for each            
          of four anatomic locations in the final analytic data.                
          These four locations were reported as triceps (BMPTRI),               
          subscapular (BMPSUB), suprailiac (BMPSUP), and thigh                  
          (BMPTHI) skinfolds.

          Data for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are                   
          considered a part of body measurements and have been                  
          included here with the body measurement data.  However, the           
          BIA resistance and reactance measures were recorded by the            
          physicians in the Physician's Examination component, hence            
          the "PEP" variable prefix.  Analyses that may require the             
          examiner identification for BIA data should use the physician         
          examiner number (PEPTECH).                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
          BIA measurements are known to be affected by a variety of             
          factors, including amputations, metal replacements, and               
          pregnancy.  Persons who were left-side amputees or had metal          
          pins in their hips with hip replacements were not excluded            
          from receiving the BIA procedure.  However, in the data               
          editing process, BIA resistance (PEP12A1) and BIA reactance           
          (PEP12B1) data for persons with either right- or left-side            
          amputations, who were pregnant, or who had metal pins in              
          their hips were recoded to 8888.                                      
                                                                                
          The "Blank but applicable" counts for PEP12A1 and PEP12B1             
          reflect cases in which persons were examined by the                   
          physician but in which the BIA procedure was not done for             
          various reasons.  The balance is accounted for by persons             
          who were not examined by the physician.

            To determine who should be excluded from receiving the BIA          
            procedure as a safety precaution, examinees were asked if they      
            had a pacemaker or were pregnant.  PEPPREG was a self-reported      
            variable and not an adjudicated assessment of pregnancy status;     
            therefore, it should not be used as the definitive pregnancy        
            variable (analysts are referred to MAPF12R and MYPC17 variables     
            for pregnancy status).
