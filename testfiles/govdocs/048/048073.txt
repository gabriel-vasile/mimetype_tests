MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Adopted:  January 29, 2007 Released: January 29, 2007
By the Deputy Chief, Broadband Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. On June 23, 2006, Paging Systems, Inc. (“PSI”) filed an application seeking Commission 
consent to assign the license for Broadband Radio Service (BRS) Station WHT743, Wichita, Kansas, to 
American Telecasting of Oklahoma, Inc. (“American Telecasting”).1  On July 12, 2006, Warren C. Havens 
(“Havens”), AMTS Consortium LLC (“AMTS Consortium”), Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC (“THL”), 
Telesaurus VPC LLC (“TVL”), and Intelligent Transportation and Monitoring Wireless LLC 
(“Intelligent”) filed, collectively, a petition to deny the application (“PTD”).2 For the reasons discussed 
below, we dismiss the PTD.  
II. BACKGROUND
2. On November 6, 2001, PSI was granted a license to operate BRS Station WHT743 on the 
E Channel Group in Wichita, Kansas.3  On June 23, 2006, PSI filed an application to assign the license for 
Station WHT743 to American Telecasting, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sprint Nextel Corporation 
(“Sprint Nextel”).   According to the applicants, the assignment of Station WHT743 to American 
Telecasting will serve the public interest because it will permit Sprint Nextel to deploy broadband

2 Warren C. Havens, AMTS Consortium LLC, Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC, Telesaurus VPC LLC, and 
Intelligent Transportation and Monitoring Wireless LLC, Petition to Deny (July 12, 2006).  We herein refer to 
the petitioning parties collectively as petitioners.

infrastructure more efficiently and develop wireless, interactive multimedia communications solutions for 
consumers in the Wichita, Kansas area.4
3. On July 12, 2006, the instant PTD was filed against the application. PSI filed an 
opposition to the PTD on July 26, 2006.5 A reply to the opposition was thereafter filed by the petitioners 
on August 7, 2006.6   
III.  DISCUSSION 
4. The petitioners contend that they have standing to file the PTD because they hold licenses 
“which may provide competitive services” to those offered by PSI7 and because “they are competitors with 
PSI in several markets and within various radio services.”8 The petitioners ask the Commission to deny the 
application to assign Station WHT743 from PSI to American Telecasting because PSI “lacks the character 
and fitness to hold or assign the [license for Station WHT743] due to its actions, including numerous 
fraudulent licensing applications, in the AMTS service.”9 The PTD explains that “[t]hese issues of fraud 
and disqualification to hold licenses are currently pending before the Commission.”10 The PTD thereafter 
notes and incorporates by reference those pleadings filed by the petitioners challenging the basic character 
qualifications of PSI in other proceedings.11 In the alternative, the petitioners request that the Commission 
hold the instant assignment application in abeyance pending final resolution of the referenced proceedings 
or condition any grant of it upon the outcome and findings of these proceedings.12

(Reply).
7 See PTD at 1.  The PTD generally states that the petitioners’ “license holdings, as witnessed by the 
Commission’s ULS records,” provide them with the requisite standing to challenge the instant assignment 
application of a BRS station.  Id.  Specifically, the PTD lists Automated Maritime Telecommunications System
(AMTS) Station WQCP815; Multiple Address System (MAS) Stations WQER424, WQER425, WQER426, 
WQER427, WQER428, WQER429; and a pending application for a Location and Monitoring Service (LMS) 
geographic area license for Wichita, Kansas as those “license holdings” which may provide competitive services 
to those offered by Station WHT743.  See id. at 1 n.1.  In addition, the PTD notes that an application is pending 
to assign 220-222 MHz Service Stations WPOI542, WPOI543, WPOI544, Wichita, Kansas, to Havens. See id.   
8 The PTD does not specify the markets in which the petitioners compete with PSI.  The PTD does reference, 
however, AMTS and MAS as examples of two services within which the petitioners may compete with PSI.  See 
id. at 1.  The PTD raises concerns that PSI will benefit from the instant assignment of BRS Station WHT743 to 
American Telecasting and furnish PSI with additional funds with which it may “more effectively hinder, compete 
and pursue frivolous actions deleterious to Petitioners. . . .”  Id. at 1.  None of the petitioners holds BRS licenses 
in the Wichita, Kansas area.

5. PSI contends that the petitioners lack standing to petition for the denial of the instant 
assignment application.13 PSI states that Section 309(d)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended,14 “requires specifics concerning the location, operational status and nature of service actually 
provided that would be competitive with the services provided by PSI.”15 PSI argues that services that may 
be offered by an applicant or licensee in the future and applications that have not yet been acted upon by 
the Commission are insufficient to accord the petitioners standing to file the instant PTD.16 PSI also 
contends that the petitioners have raised similar allegations in the context of other Commission proceedings 
and that “this proceeding is not the place . . .  to reargue the positions already taken in other matters still 
pending.”17 PSI alleges that the “so-called facts by Petitioners are nothing more than allegations and 
speculation contained in other filings.”18 PSI emphasizes that the PTD fails to cite a Commission decision 
that makes adverse findings with respect to PSI’s qualifications to hold Commission licenses.19
6. Section 1.939(d) of the Commission’s Rules requires that a petition to deny contain 
specific allegations of fact sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the petitioner is a party in interest 
and that a grant of the application would be inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and 
necessity.20  To establish a party in interest standing, a petitioner must allege facts sufficient to demonstrate
that grant of the subject applications would cause it to suffer a direct injury.21 In addition, a petitioner 
must demonstrate a causal link between the claimed injury and the challenged action.22  Based on our 
review of the record in this proceeding, we find that the PTD fails to meet this standard.23
7. We find that the PTD fails to contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to make a 
prima facie showing that the petitioners, individually or collectively, have the requisite standing to file the

16 See id. 
17 Id. at 5.  PSI also notes that the Commission has taken action in a number of the proceedings that were 
identified by the petitioners.  See id. at 6.  The petitioners respond by noting that any Commission action taken in 
those proceedings is not final because they have filed petitions seeking reconsideration or applications seeking 
full Commission review of those decisions.  See Reply.

23 In addition, given our disposition of this matter, we do not reach PSI’s other procedural challenge to the PTD, 
which asserts that service of the PTD on PSI’s counsel was defective under 47 C.F.R. § 1.47.  See Opposition at

instant PTD.24  The petitioners are required to specifically plead and establish standing in the PTD.25  
Petitioners fail to explain how any of the license holdings referenced in the PTD26 accord it broad standing 
to challenge the instant application to assign a BRS station from PSI to American Telecasting.27 The 
petitioners’ reliance on Mobex28 is misplaced.29  Mobex addressed the specific issue of whether, “in certain 
instances, the need to locate and monitor mobile radio units could be equally met by AMTS or LMS.”30  
Mobex does not support the petitioners’ broad presumption that holding a license in any wireless service in 
the Wichita, Kansas area is sufficient to accord them standing to file the instant PTD against an application 
to assign a BRS station in the Wichita, Kansas area from PSI to American Telecasting.31  The PTD offers 
  
24 See 47 C.F.R. § 1.939(d)(1).  Section 309(d)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, permits any “party 
in interest” to file a petition to deny any application. 47 U.S.C. § 309(d)(1).  To establish standing, a petitioner 
must show “(1) a distinct and palpable personal injury-in-fact that is (2) traceable to the respondent's conduct and 
(3) redressable by the relief requested.”  See Weblink Wireless, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 17 FCC 
Rcd 24642, 24647 ¶ 11 (WTB 2002); AT&T Corp., Complainant, v. Business Telecom, Inc., Defendants, Order 
on Reconsideration, 16 FCC Rcd 21750, 21753-21754 ¶ 7 (2001); Chris C. Hudgins, Order on Reconsideration, 
16 FCC Rcd 7941 (2001).
25 See 47 C.F.R. § 1.939(d)(1).
26 See PTD at 2.  We reject the petitioners’ attempt to broadly establish standing by generally referencing the 
petitioners’ “license holdings, as witnessed by the Commission’s ULS records.”  PTD at 1.  47 C.F.R. § 
1.939(d)(1) requires a petitioner to set-forth specific allegations of fact to make a prima facie showing that the 
petitioner is a party in interest.  However, we will herein address the issue of whether the specific license 
holdings referenced in the PTD accord the petitioners’ standing to challenge the instant assignment application 
of a BRS station.  See PTD at 2.     
27 See PTD at 1-2; see also Reply at 2-3. 
28 Mobex Network Services, LLC, Order, 18 FCC Rcd 12305 (WTB PSPWD 2003) (Mobex).  
29 See PTD at 1-2; see also Reply 2-3.  
30 Mobex, 18 FCC Rcd at 12307 ¶ 5.  Specifically, the former Public Safety and Private Wireless Division 
(PSWPD) of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau concluded that it was conceivable for AMTS and LMS to 
compete for customers who need to locate and monitor mobile radio units.  See id.  Therefore, in Mobex, an LMS 
licensee was found to have standing to file a petition to deny against an application to modify AMTS facilities “in 
view of the fact that there was a service area overlap” where the need to locate and monitor mobile radio units 
could be equally met by the AMTS licensee or the LMS licensee within that service area.  Id. 
31 See PTD at 1-2; see also Reply 2-3.  The PTD references other proceedings where one or more of the 
petitioners were found to have standing to file a petition to deny against PSI or another applicant or licensee.  See 
PTD at 2.  However, the petitioners fail to explain the relevancy of those proceedings in the context of the instant 
PTD.  For example, the former Public Safety and Critical Infrastructure Division (PSICD) of the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau found that AMTS Consortium and Intelligent had standing to challenge the long-
form AMTS application filed by PSI at the conclusion of Auction No. 61 because AMTS Consortium and 
Intelligent were both competing participants in Auction No. 61.  See Maritime Communications Land Mobile, 
LLC, Paging Systems, Inc., Order, 21 FCC Rcd 8794 (WTB PSCID 2006) (PSI AMTS Auction 61 Order); see 
also Paging Systems, Inc., Order, 21 FCC Rcd 3032 (WTB PSCID 2006) (finding that Intelligent had standing 
to file a petition to deny against the long-form AMTS application filed by PSI in Auction No. 59 because it was a 
competing bidder against PSI in Auction No. 59); High Plains Wireless, L.P. v. FCC, 276 F.3d 599, 605 (D.C. 
Cir. 2002) (holding that auction participant had standing to challenge award to another of a license for which it 
bid).

no explanation how the petitioners’ referenced AMTS32 licenses, MAS33 licenses, or LMS34 applications 
could be used to provide high-speed, high-capacity broadband service to compete with BRS35 facilities for 
the provision of integrated access to voice, high-speed data, video-on-demand, and interactive delivery 
services from a wireless device.36  We also reject the petitioners’ contention that, because “they are 
competitors with PSI in several markets and within various radio services,”37 they have standing to file the 
instant PTD.38 The petitioners cite no precedent for such a broad declaration of standing.  Accordingly, we 
dismiss the PTD.39
  
32 AMTS stations provide automated, integrated, interconnected ship-to-shore communications similar to a 
cellular phone system for tugs, barges, and other maritime vessels. See Amendment of Parts 2 and 80 of the 
Commission's Rules Applicable to Automated Maritime Telecommunications Systems (AMTS), First Report and 
Order, GEN Docket No. 88-732, 6 FCC Rcd 437, 437 ¶ 3 (1991) (AMTS First Report and Order).
33 MAS is a private fixed microwave radio service that operates on spectrum in the 900 MHz band for point-to-
multipoint and multipoint-to-point communications.  See Amendment of the Commission’s Rules Regarding 
Multiple Address Systems, Report and Order, WT Docket No. 97-81, 15 FCC Rcd 11956, 11957 ¶ 1 (2000), 
corrected by Erratum, 15 FCC Rcd 16145, reconsideration granted in part, 16 FCC Rcd 12181 (2001) (MAS 
Report and Order). MAS licenses are available for the terrestrial point-to-multipoint and point-to-point fixed 
and mobile transmissions of a licensee’s products or services, excluding video entertainment material, to a 
licensee’s customer or for its own internal communications.
34 LMS provides the use of non-voice signaling methods to locate or monitor mobile radio units.  LMS systems 
may transmit and receive voice and non-voice status and instructional information related to such units. See 47 
C.F.R. § 90.7.
35 BRS provides integrated access to broadband technologies, including high-speed digital technologies that 
provide consumers integrated access to voice, high-speed data, video-on-demand, and interactive delivery 
services.  In The Matter Of Amendment Of Parts 1, 21, 73, 74 And 101 Of The Commission's Rules To Facilitate 
The Provision Of Fixed And Mobile Broadband Access, Educational And Other Advanced Services In The 2150-
2162 And 2500-2690 MHz Bands, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WT Docket 
No. 03-66, 19 FCC Rcd 14165, ¶ 9 (2004).  
36 See, e.g., Mobex, 18 FCC Rcd at 12307 ¶ 5 (discussed above); see also New World Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 294 
F.3d 164, 169-72 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (standing “is premised on the petitioner’s status as a direct and current 
competitor whose bottom line may be adversely affected by the challenged government action,” so no standing to 
challenge license grant that “is, at most, the first step in the direction of future competition” and thus economic 
injury dependent on “chain of events”); see also KERM, Inc. v. FCC, 353 F.3d 57, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (no 
standing to challenge FCC decision not to pursue enforcement action against station that serves much of the 
same audience as petitioner where latter made only “‘bare allegations’” of competitive injury without any 
evidence of adverse financial effects resulting from broadcast of disputed commercials) (quoting Sierra Club v. 
EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).  
37 The PTD does not specify the markets in which the petitioners compete with PSI.  The PTD does reference, 
however, AMTS and MAS as examples of two services within which the petitioners may compete with PSI.  See 
PTD at 1.  None of the petitioners holds BRS licenses in the Wichita, Kansas area.        
38 The PTD raises concerns that PSI will benefit from the instant assignment of BRS Station WHT743 to 
American Telecasting and thereby obtain additional funds that could be used to compete against the petitioners in 
other markets and in other services, such as AMTS and MAS.  See PTD at 1.

8. While the PTD has been dismissed, it is in our discretion to informally consider its 
allegations.40 We have determined that petitioners’ arguments provide no basis for denying the 
Application.  Petitioners do not contend that PSI has engaged in any misconduct with respect to the stations 
at issue.  We also note that petitioners’ allegations concerning Auction 61 and the AMTS stations have 
been rejected in other contexts and that the arguments will be considered when the pending petitions 
challenging those orders are resolved.41  
9. The former PSCID specifically rejected the petitioners’ allegation that PSI lacks the 
requisite character qualifications to be a Commission licensee in the PSI MAS Order.42 In that proceeding, 
the petitioners filed a petition to deny PSI’s long-form application for the MAS licenses for which PSI was 
the high bidder in Auction No. 59.43 As in the instant PTD, the petitioners challenged the basic character 
qualifications of PSI in that proceeding and incorporated by reference several other pleadings and 
proceedings where the petitioners raised the issue before the Commission.44 The former PSCID found that 
“specific findings and legal conclusions regarding the construction status of, and PSI’s representations 
regarding, the Great Lakes AMTS stations and AMTS Station WHG545 are more appropriately 
considered in the pending proceedings involving those stations, rather than the instant proceeding.”45 The 
former PSCID noted that, “[t]o date, there has been no finding against PSI in those proceedings, or in any 
other proceeding, of a disqualifying lack of character.”46 Therefore, the former PSCID concluded that, 
“[i]n the absence of such a finding, or at least a determination in one of those other proceedings that PSI’s 
basic qualifications to hold any Commission license should be designated for hearing, we see no basis to

41 See Maritime Communications Land Mobile, LLC, Paging Systems, Inc., Order, 21 FCC Rcd 8794 (WTB 
PSCID 2006) (rejecting petitioners’ arguments that the long-form application filed by PSI at the conclusion of 
AMTS Auction No. 61 should be denied because PSI’s incumbent site-based B-Block license in Hawaii is no 
longer valid, and PSI’s concealment of this invalidity fraudulently dissuaded the petitioners from bidding more 
aggressively on the B-Block license for that geographic area); Paging Systems, Inc., Order, 21 FCC Rcd 7225 
(WTB PSCID 2006) (PSCID concludes that it would not further the public interest to deny a renewal application 
based on alleged defects in construction notifications because “the purpose of a construction notification 
requirement is to confirm that licensees have met their responsibility, not to cancel the licenses for legitimately 
operating facilities. . . . Even assuming arguendo that the initial activation notices were defective, deeming the 
licenses for the constructed stations to have automatically canceled as a result would not further the purpose of 
the construction notification requirement.”) (internal citation omitted); Paging Systems, Inc., Order on 
Reconsideration, 21 FCC Rcd 5848 (WTB PSCID 2006) (affirming the denial of a petition to deny the long-form 
application filed by PSI at the conclusion of the first auction for AMTS licenses (Auction No. 57)); see also

deny the instant Application.”47 The petitioners are currently seeking reconsideration of the PSI MAS 
Order.48 We find that the same rationale applies here.
IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDERING CLAUSES
10. For the reasons discussed above, we find that the PTD fails to contain specific allegations 
of fact sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the petitioners, individually or collectively, have the 
requisite standing to file the instant PTD.49  We therefore dismiss the PTD.  After considering the PTD as 
an informal complaint,50 we conclude that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate how denial of the 
instant assignment application would serve the public interest.  
11. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Sections 4(i) and 309 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§154(i), 309, and Section 1.939 of the 
Commission’s Rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.939, that the Petition to Deny filed by Warren C. Havens, AMTS
Consortium LLC, Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC, Telesaurus VPC LLC, and Intelligent Transportation and 
Monitoring Wireless LLC on July 12, 2006 IS DISMISSED.
12. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Sections 4(i) and 309 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 154(i), and Section 1.948 of the Commission’s 
Rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.948, that the licensing staff of the Broadband Division SHALL PROCESS the 
application filed by Paging Systems, Inc. (File No. 0002647326) in accordance with this Memorandum 
Opinion and Order and the applicable Commission’s Rules.

47 Id.  The former PSCID further noted that “[e]ven if it is ultimately determined that PSI’s applications 
misstated the construction status of the AMTS stations in question, as alleged by the Petitioners, it would not 
necessarily call into question PSI’s basic qualifications.”  Id.
