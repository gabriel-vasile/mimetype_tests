     hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less 
     serious than discipline by the full Senate;
       (4) in the circumstances described in subsection (d)(3),

     officers or employees of the Senate, in the performance of 
     their duties and the discharge of their responsibilities;
       (6) by a majority vote of the full committee, report

     to educate Members, officers, and employees about the laws, 
     rules, regulations, and standards of conduct applicable to 
     such individuals in the performance of their duties.
       (b) For the purposes of this resolution--
       (1) the term ``sworn complaint'' means a written statement 
     of facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the 
     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of 
     law the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule or 
     regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of 
     individuals in the performance of their duties as Members, 
     officer, or employees of the Senate;
       (2) the term ``preliminary inquiry'' means a proceeding 
     undertaken by the Select Committee following the receipt of a 
     complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct 
     by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine 
     whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides 
     substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a 
     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has 
     occurred; and
       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding 
     undertakin by the Select Committee after a finding, on the

[[Page S1571]]

       (2) No other resolution, report, recommendation, 
     interpretative ruling, or advisory opinion may be made 
     without an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of 
     the Select Committee voting.
       (d)(1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint 
     or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, 
     or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a 
     preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, 
     allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be 
     of a duration and scope necessary to determine whether there 
     is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial 
     cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation 
     within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. 
     The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice 
     chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate 
     duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.
       (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under 
     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded 
     vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, 
     the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select 
     Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the 
     authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any 
     matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, 
     lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform 
     the individual who provided to the Select Committee the 
     complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who 
     is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, 
     of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis 
     for the dismissal.
       (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under 
     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a 
     violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de 
     minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the 
     matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, 
     which shall not be considered discipline. The Select 
     Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a 
     similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory 
     review.
       (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under 
     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is 
     such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be 
     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select 
     Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. 
     Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select 
     Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, 
     the results of such adjudicatory review together with its 
     recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2).
       (e)(1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or 
     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) 
     may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the 
     Senate on its action imposing a reprimand or order of 
     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing 
     written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select 
     Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The 
     presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the 
     appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the 
     Senate Journal.
       (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal 
     pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not 
     debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the 
     appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis 
     of the Select Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the 
     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided 
     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those 
     opposing the appeal.
       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ 
     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact 
     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the 
     disposition of complaints.
       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no 
     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged 
     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, 
     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the 
     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code 
     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of 
     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to 
     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. 
     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of 
     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect 
     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct 
     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was 
     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the 
     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.
       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rule setting 
     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary 
     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.
       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit 
     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative 
     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the 
     effective discharge of its duties.

     administer such oaths; (6) take such testimony orally or by

     it deems advisable; and (8) to procure the temporary services 
     (not in excess of one year) or intermittent services of 
     individual consultants, or organizations thereof, by contract 
     as independent contractors or, in the case of individuals, by 
     employment at daily rates of compensation not in excess of 
     the per diem equivalent of the highest rate of compensation 
     which may be paid to a regular employee of the Select 
     Committee.
       (b)(1) The Select Committee is authorized to retain and 
     compensate counsel not employed by the Senate (or by any 
     department or agency of the executive branch of the 
     Government) whenever the Select Committee determines that the 
     retention of outside counsel is necessary or appropriate for 
     any action regarding any complaint or allegation, which, in 
     the determination of the Select Committee is more 
     appropriately conducted by counsel not employed by the 
     Government of the United States as a regular employee.
       (2) Any adjudicatory review as defined in section 2(b)(3) 
     shall be conducted by outside counsel as authorized in 
     paragraph (1), unless the Select Committee determines not to 
     use outside counsel.
       (c) With the prior consent of the department or agency 
     concerned, the Select Committee may (1) utilize the services, 
     information and facilities of any such department or agency 
     of the Government, and (2) employ on a reimbursable basis or 
     otherwise the services of such personnel of any such 
     department or agency as it deems advisable. With the consent 
     of any other committee of the Senate, or any subcommittee 
     thereof, the Select Committee may utilize the facilities and 
     services of the staff of such other committee or subcommittee 
     whenever the chairman of the Select Committee determines that 
     such action is necessary and appropriate.
       (d)(1) Subpoenas may be authorized by--
       (A) the Select Committee; or
       (B) the chairman and vice chairman, acting jointly.

     interpretative rulings explaining and clarifying the 
     application of any law, the Code of Official Conduct, or any 
     rules or regulation of the Senate within its jurisdiction.
       (3) The Select Committee shall render an advisory opinion, 
     in writing within a reasonable time, in response to a written 
     request by a Member or officer of the Senate or a candidate 
     for nomination for election, or election to the Senate, 
     concerning the application of any law, the Senate Code of

     within its jurisdiction to a specific factual situation 
     pertinent to the conduct or proposed conduct of the person 
     seeking the advisory opinion.
       (4) The Select Committee may in its discretion render an 
     advisory opinion in writing within a reasonable time in 
     response to a written request by an employee of the Senate 
     concerning the application of any law, the Senate Code of

     pertinent to the conduct or proposed conduct of the person 
     seeking the advisory opinion.
       (5) Notwithstanding any provision of the Senate Code of 
     Official Conduct or any rule or regulation of the Senate, any 
     person who relies upon any provision or finding of an 
     advisory opinion in accordance with the provisions of 
     paragraphs (3) and (4) and who acts in good faith in 
     accordance with the provisions and findings of such advisory

     Congressional Record with appropriate deletions to assure the 
     privacy of the individual concerned. The Select Committee

     advisory opinion, provide any interested party with an 
     opportunity to transmit written comments to the Select 
     Committee with respect to the request for such advisory 
     opinion. The advisory opinions issued by the select Committee

     business and the procedure of the Committee shall in the 
     first instance be decided by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, 
     subject to reversal by a vote by a majority of the Committee.
       (f) Hearings Announcements: The Committee shall make public 
     announcement of the date, place and subject matter of any 
     hearing to be conducted by it at least one week before the 
     commencement of that hearing, and shall publish such 
     announcement in the Congressional Record. If the Committee 
     determines that there is good cause to commence a hearing at 
     an earlier date, such notice will be given at the earliest 
     possible time.
       (g) Open and Closed Committee Meetings: Meetings of the 
     Committee shall be open to the public or closed to the public 
     (executive session), as determined under the provisions of 
     paragraphs 5 (b) to (d) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of 
     the Senate. Executive session meetings of the Committee shall 
     be closed except to the members and the staff of the 
     Committee. On the motion of any member, and with the approval 
     of a majority of the Committee members present, other 
     individuals may be admitted to an executive session meeting 
     for a specific period or purpose.
       (h) Record of Testimony and Committee Action: An accurate 
     stenographic or transcribed electronic record shall be kept 
     of all Committee proceedings, whether in executive or public 
     session. Such record shall include Senators' votes on any 
     question on which a recorded vote is held. The record of a 
     witness's testimony, whether in public or executive session, 
     shall be made available for inspection to the witness or his 
     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony 
     given by that witness in public session, or that part of the 
     testimony given by the witness in executive session and 
     subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a public 
     session shall be made available to any witness if he so 
     requests. (See Rule 5 on Procedures for Conducting Hearings.)
       (i) Secrecy of Executive Testimony and Action and of 
     Complaint Proceedings:
       (1) All testimony and action taken in executive session 
     shall be kept secret and shall not be released outside the 
     Committee to any individual or group, whether governmental or 
     private, without the approval of a majority of the Committee.
       (2) All testimony and action relating to a complaint or 
     allegation shall be kept secret and shall not be released by 
     the Committee to any individual or group, whether 
     governmental or private, except the respondent, without the 
     approval of a majority of the Committee, until such time as a 
     report to the Senate is required under Senate Resolution 338, 
     88th Congress, as amended, or unless otherwise permitted 
     under these Rules. (See Rule 8 on Procedures for Handling 
     Committee Sensitive and Classified Materials.)
       (j) Release of Reports to Public: No information pertaining 
     to, or copies of any Committee report, study, or other 
     document which purports to express the view, findings, 
     conclusions or recommendations of the Committee in connection 
     with any of its activities or proceedings may be released to 
     any individual or group whether governmental or private, 
     without the authorization of the Committee. Whenever the 
     Chairman or Vice Chairman is authorized to make any 
     determination, then the determination may be released at his 
     or her discretion. Each member of the Committee shall be 
     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views 
     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on 
     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified 
     Materials.)
       (k) Ineligibility or Disqualification of Members and Staff:
       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to 
     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates 
     specifically to any of the following:
       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating 
     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or 
     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed 
     by the member; and
       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee 
     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory 
     review described in subparagraph (A).
       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee 
     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any 
     officer or employee consistent with the provision of 
     paragraph 12 of rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the 
     Senate.
       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a 
     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph 
     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to 
     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the 
     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that 
     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in 
     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the 
     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to 
     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is 
     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice 
     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not 
     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman 
     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is 
     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if 
     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe 
     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that 
     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly 
     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or 
     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any 
     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall 
     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in 
     executive session, with the member in question not 
     participating.
       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the 
     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in 
     any

[[Page S1573]]

     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before the 
     Committee and the determinations and recommendations of the 
     Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or 
     adjudicatory review.
       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible 
     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry 
     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself 
     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary 
     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be 
     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee 
     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or 
     adjudicatory review and the determinations and 
     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such 
     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the 
     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party 
     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or 
     herself.
       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written 
     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member 
     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other 
     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in 
     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).
       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to 
     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff 
     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically 
     to any of the following:
       (A) the staff member's own conduct;
       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member 
     supervises;
       (C) the conduct of any Member, officer or employee for whom 
     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or
       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the 
     staff member. At the direction or with the consent of the 
     staff director or outside counsel, a staff member may also be 
     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in 
     other circumstances not listed above.
       (l) Recorded Votes: Any member may require a recorded vote 
     on any matter.
       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:
       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question 
     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of a 
     preliminary inquiry or an adjudicatory review, or the 
     issuance of a report or recommendation related thereto 
     concerning a Member or officer of the Senate. In any such 
     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the 
     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced 
     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.
       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph 
     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held 
     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the 
     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on 
     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the 
     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.
       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered 
     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.
       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of 
     establishing a quorum.
       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts Between Sessions and During 
     Extended Recesses: During any period in which the Senate 
     stands in adjournment between sessions of the Congress or 
     stands in a recess scheduled to extend beyond fourteen days, 
     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, or their designees, acting 
     jointly, are authorized to approve or disapprove blind trusts 
     under the provision of Rule XXXIV.
       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other 
     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the 
     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize 
     the services, information, or facilities of any such 
     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a 
     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such 
     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems 
     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the 
     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the 
     facilities and the services of the staff of such other 
     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice 
     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that 
     such action is necessary and appropriate.


     Rule 2: Procedures for Complaints, Allegations, or Information

       (a) Complaint, Allegation, or Information: Any member or 
     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, 
     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn 
     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that 
     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has 
     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or 
     any rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the 
     conduct of any individual in the performance of his or her 
     duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or 
     has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the 
     Senate. Such complaints or allegations or information may 
     be reported to the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a 
     Committee member, or a Committee staff member.
       (b) Source of Complaint, Allegation, or Information: 
     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to 
     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, 
     including but not limited to the following:
       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of 
     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the 
     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of 
     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule 
     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of 
     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, 
     officers, or employees of the Senate;
       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;
       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the 
     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, 
     including information obtained in connection with legislative 
     or general oversight hearings;
       (4) information reported by the news media; or
       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or 
     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.
       (c) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint need not be 
     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive 
     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:
       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and 
     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;
       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of 
     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in 
     improper conduct or committed a violation;
       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or 
     violation;
       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party 
     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her 
     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.


        Rule 3: Procedures for Conducting a Preliminary Inquiry

       (a) Definition of Preliminary Inquiry: A ``preliminary 
     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee 
     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or 
     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or 
     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is 
     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial 
     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within 
     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.
       (b) Basis For Preliminary Inquiry: The Committee shall 
     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has 
     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or 
     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant 
     to Rule 2.
       (c) Scope of Preliminary Inquiry:
       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and 
     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is 
     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial 
     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within 
     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman 
     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee 
     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, 
     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary 
     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice 
     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day 
     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman 
     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.
       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, 
     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas 
     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make 
     any determination provided for by this Rule.
       (d) Opportunity for Response: A preliminary inquiry may 
     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her 
     designated representative to present either a written or oral 
     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the 
     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be 
     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement 
     or answers.
       (e) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel 
     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and 
     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The 
     reports shall be confidential.
       (f) Final Report: When the preliminary inquiry is 
     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a 
     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on 
     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.
       (g) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following 
     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the 
     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is 
     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial 
     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within 
     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee 
     may make any of the following determinations:
       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such 
     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the 
     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the 
     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary 
     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The 
     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.
       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such 
     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation 
     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a deminimis 
     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter 
     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which 
     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be 
     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of 
     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote 
     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.
       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such 
     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be 
     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, 
     the Committee shall promptly initiate an

[[Page S1574]]

     adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 4. No 
     adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer, or 
     employee of the Senate may be initiated except by the 
     affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of 
     the Committee.


        Rule 4: Procedures for Conducting an Adjudicatory Review

       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review: An ``adjudicatory 
     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a 
     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is 
     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a 
     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has 
     occurred.
       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review: When the Committee 
     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of 
     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to 
     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has 
     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by 
     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate 
     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use 
     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, 
     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines 
     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may 
     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, 
     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any 
     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure 
     the evidence necessary to make a determination.
       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written 
     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an 
     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the 
     respondent no later than five working days after the 
     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The 
     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the 
     possible violation, and description of the evidence 
     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee 
     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a 
     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions 
     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or 
     outside counsel.
       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a 
     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends 
     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or 
     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not 
     requiring discipline by the full Senate).
       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or 
     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee 
     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such 
     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and 
     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and 
     shall be confidential.
       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee: Upon 
     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings 
     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff 
     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, 
     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory 
     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if 
     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review 
     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary 
     action is recommended.
       (g) Committee Action:
       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the 
     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory 
     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to 
     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution 
     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. 
     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's 
     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is 
     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons 
     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning 
     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of 
     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be 
     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating 
     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except 
     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four 
     members of the Committee.
       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), 
     subsections (2), (3), & (4), after receipt of the report 
     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may 
     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary 
     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as 
     follows:
       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate 
     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, 
     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the 
     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a 
     combination of these;
       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a 
     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, 
     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;
       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after 
     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and 
     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred 
     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the 
     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) 
     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six 
     members order that a Member, officer or employee be 
     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;
       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that 
     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de 
     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of 
     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not 
     be subject to appeal to the Senate.
       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon 
     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not 
     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence 
     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to 
     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the 
     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.
       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory 
     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, 
     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy 
     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The 
     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and 
     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded 
     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it 
     should remain confidential.
       (h) Right of Appeal:
       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or 
     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection 
     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to 
     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of 
     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing 
     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the 
     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall 
     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the 
     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.
       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to 
     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be 
     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed 
     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall 
     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the 
     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, 
     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, 
     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.


                    Rule 5: Procedures for Hearings

       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or 
     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory 
     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a 
     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends 
     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or 
     before it imposes on order of restitution or reprimand. (See 
     Rule 4(d)).
       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time 
     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) 
     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to 
     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive 
     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for 
     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall 
     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she 
     is scheduled to testify.
       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by the 
     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, 
     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory 
     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible 
     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents 
     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. 
     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in 
     paragraph (j) shall apply.
       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena 
     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses 
     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, 
     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule 
     6.)
       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an 
     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any 
     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).
       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the 
     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice 
     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the 
     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is 
     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the 
     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee 
     member.
       (g) Witnesses: (1) A subpoena or other request to testify 
     shall be served on a witness sufficiently in advance of his 
     or her scheduled appearance to allow the witness a reasonable 
     period of time, as determined by the Committee, to prepare 
     for the hearing and to employ counsel if desired.
       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than 
     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the 
     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the 
     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the 
     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as 
     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, 
     acting jointly.
       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written 
     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy 
     of such statement with the Committee at least two working 
     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to 
     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine 
     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record 
     of the hearing.
       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted 
     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she 
     desires to do so.
       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or 
     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in 
     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff 
     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably 
     believes

[[Page S1575]]

     that the statement tends to adversely affect his or her 
     reputation may--
       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to 
     testify in his or her own behalf; or
       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the 
     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she 
     complained. Such request and such statement shall be 
     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.
       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding 
     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by 
     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by 
     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender 
     be cited for contempt of Congress.
       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:
       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement 
     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall 
     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all 
     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise 
     summoned to testify.
       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:
       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of 
     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the 
     following information and documents to the respondent, if 
     any:
       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the 
     hearing;
       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as 
     exhibits at the hearing; and
       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony 
     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the 
     hearing.
       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of 
     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall 
     provide the information and documents described in divisions, 
     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.
       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and 
     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be 
     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and 
     disclosure.
       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and 
     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this 
     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual 
     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the 
     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that 
     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.
       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at 
     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding 
     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have 
     to be sworn.
       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory 
     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own 
     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his 
     or her legal rights during the testimony.
       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:
       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other 
     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may 
     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called 
     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own 
     behalf.
       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the 
     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the 
     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application 
     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent 
     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and 
     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.
       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or 
     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such 
     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the 
     witness or by that party's counsel.
       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled 
     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to 
     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that 
     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, 
     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, 
     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee 
     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit 
     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four 
     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The 
     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject 
     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting 
     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.
       (6) Admissibility of evidence:
       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the 
     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall 
     be admissible, unless privileged under the Federal Rules of 
     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly but 
     the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly 
     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight 
     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.
       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of 
     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to 
     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or 
     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of 
     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.
       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter 
     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual 
     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual 
     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee, within the 
     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided 
     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal 
     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit 
     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only 
     upon a determination of not less than four members of the 
     full Committee that the interests of justice require that 
     such evidence be admitted.
       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may 
     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems 
     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory 
     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be 
     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made 
     available upon request to any member of the public.
       (k) Transcripts:
       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall 
     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of 
     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel 
     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of 
     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own 
     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any 
     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter 
     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff 
     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by 
     the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly. Any member or 
     witness shall return the transcript with suggested 
     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days 
     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is 
     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, 
     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a 
     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting 
     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing 
     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.
       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to 
     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is 
     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the 
     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections 
     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or 
     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such 
     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within 
     such time.
       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, 
     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a 
     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive 
     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon 
     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions 
     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any 
     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the 
     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be 
     cited for contempt of Congress.


                   Rule 6: Subpoenas and Depositions

       (a) Subpoenas:
       (1) Authorization for issuance: Subpoenas for the 
     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or 
     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and 
     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and 
     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by 
     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time 
     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other 
     proceeding.
       (2) Signature and service: All subpoenas shall be signed by 
     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any 
     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by 
     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served 
     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief 
     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.
       (3) Withdrawal of subpoena: The Committee, by recorded vote 
     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw 
     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for 
     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. 
     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw 
     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.
       (b) Depositions:
       (1) Persons authorized to take depositions: Depositions may 
     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other 
     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting 
     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other 
     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to 
     the Committee.
       (2) Deposition notices: Notices for the taking of 
     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the 
     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the 
     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or 
     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, 
     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a 
     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. 
     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for 
     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall 
     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced 
     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been 
     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. 
     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to 
     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's 
     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, 
     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena 
     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and 
     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.
       (3) Counsel at depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at 
     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.

[[Page S1576]]

       (4) Deposition procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be 
     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized 
     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of 
     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded 
     by any person or persons who are authorized to take 
     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a 
     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a 
     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule 
     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct 
     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. 
     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who 
     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting 
     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the 
     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, 
     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from 
     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer 
     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the 
     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, 
     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the 
     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to 
     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee 
     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal 
     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce 
     documents after having been directed to do so.
       (5) Filing of depositions: Deposition testimony shall be 
     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is 
     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall 
     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in 
     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that 
     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The 
     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the 
     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be 
     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices 
     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time 
     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, 
     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to 
     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring 
     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the 
     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about 
     those facts with a request that it be attached to the 
     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, 
     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or 
     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's 
     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under 
     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be 
     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized 
     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in 
     this procedure.


   Rule 7: Violations of Law; Perjury; Legislative Recommendations; 
   Educational Mandate; and Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct

       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by 
     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full 
     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of 
     law, including the provision of false information to the 
     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible 
     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.
       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears 
     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to 
     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee 
     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for 
     prosecution.
       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall 
     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such 
     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures 
     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure 
     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or 
     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such 
     preliminary inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a 
     report or resolution, including the holding of hearings in 
     public or executive session and the use of subpoenas to 
     compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of 
     materials. The Committee may make legislative recommendations 
     as a result of its findings in a preliminary inquiry, 
     adjudicatory review, or other proceeding.
       (d) Educational Mandate; The Committee shall develop and 
     implement programs and materials designed to educate Members, 
     officers, and employees about the laws, rules, regulations, 
     and standards of conduct applicable to such individuals in 
     the performance of their duties.
       (e) Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct:
       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no 
     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged 
     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, 
     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the 
     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code 
     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of 
     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to 
     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code.
       (2) The Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of 
     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect 
     prior to enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct if 
     the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was in 
     effect and the violation was not a matter resolved in the 
     merits by the predecessor Committee.


  Rule 8: Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified 
                               Materials

       (a) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive Materials:
       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is 
     information or material in the possession of the Select 
     Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper 
     conduct by a present or former Member, officer, or employee 
     of the Senate; to allegations or accusations of such conduct; 
     to any resulting preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or 
     other proceeding by the Select Committee on Ethics into such 
     allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and 
     procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to the 
     information or material designated by the staff director, or 
     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.
       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall 
     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the 
     unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in 
     the possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for 
     protecting Committee Sensitive materials shall be in writing 
     and shall be given to each Committee staff member.
       (b) Procedures for Handling Classified Materials:
       (1) Classified information or material is information or 
     material which is specifically designated as classified under 
     the authority of Executive Order 11652 requiring protection 
     of such information or material from unauthorized disclosure 
     in order to prevent damage to the United States.
       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall 
     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the

     the procedures shall be given to each staff member cleared 
     for access to classified information.
       (3) Each member of the Committee shall have access to 
     classified material in the Committee's possession. Only 
     Committee staff members with appropriate security clearances

     further segregated in the Committee's offices in secure 
     filing safes. Removal from the Committee offices of such 
     documents or materials is prohibited except as necessary for 
     use in, or preparation for, interviews or Committee meetings, 
     including the taking of testimony, or as otherwise 
     specifically approved by the staff director or by outside 
     counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.
       (2) Each member of the Committee shall have access to all 
     materials in the Committee's possession. The staffs of 
     members shall not have access to Committee Sensitive or 
     classified documents and materials without the specific

     acting jointly. Members may examine such materials in the 
     Committee's offices. If necessary, requested materials may be 
     hand delivered by a member of the Committee staff to the 
     member of the Committee, or to a staff person(s) specifically 
     designated by the member, for the Member's or designated 
     staffer's examination. A member of the Committee who has

     designated representative.
       (4) Any Member of the Senate who is not a member of the 
     Committee and who seeks access to any Committee Sensitive or 
     classified documents or materials, other than documents or 
     materials which are matters of public record, shall request 
     access in writing. The Committee shall decide by majority 
     vote whether to make documents or materials available. If 
     access is granted, the Member shall not disclose the 
     information except as authorized by the Committee.
       (5) Whenever the Committee makes Committee Sensitive or 
     classified documents or materials available to any Member of 
     the Senate who is not a member of the Committee, or to a 
     staff person of a Committee member in response to a specific 
     request to the Chairman and Vice Chairman, a written record 
     shall be made identifying the Member of the Senate requesting 
     such documents or materials and describing what was made 
     available and to whom.
       (d) Non-Disclosure Policy and Agreement:
       (1) Except as provided in the last sentence of this 
     paragraph, no member of the Select Committee on Ethics, its 
     staff or any person

[[Page S1577]]

     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for the 
     Select Committee on Ethics shall release, divulge, publish, 
     reveal by writing, word, conduct, or disclose in any way, in 
     whole, or in part, or by way of summary, during tenure with 
     the Select Committee on Ethics or anytime thereafter, any 
     testimony given before the Select Committee on Ethics in 
     executive session (including the name of any witness who 
     appeared or was called to appear in executive session), any 
     classified or Committee Sensitive information, document or 
     material, received or generated by the Select Committee on 
     Ethics or any classified or Committee Sensitive information 
     which may come into the possession of such person during 
     tenure with the Select Committee on Ethics or its staff. Such 
     information, documents, or material may be released to an 
     official of the executive branch properly cleared for access 
     with a need-to-know, for any purpose or in connection with 
     any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, as authorized by the 
     Select Committee on Ethics, or in the event of termination of 
     the Select Committee on Ethics, in such a manner as may be 
     determined by its successor or by the Senate.
       (2) No member of the Select Committee on Ethics staff or 
     any person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform 
     services for the Select Committee on Ethics, shall be granted 
     access to classified or Committee Sensitive information or 
     material in the possession of the Select Committee on Ethics 
     unless and until such person agrees in writing, as a 
     condition of employment, to the non-disclosure policy. The 
     agreement shall become effective when signed by the Chairman 
     and Vice Chairman on behalf of the Committee.


    Rule 9: Broadcasting and News Coverage of Committee Proceedings

       (a) Whenever any hearing or meeting of the Committee is 
     open to the public, the Committee shall permit that hearing 
     or meeting to be covered in whole or in part, by television 
     broadcast, radio broadcast, still photography, or by any 
     other methods of coverage, unless the Committee decides by 
     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee 
     that such coverage is not appropriate at a particular hearing
