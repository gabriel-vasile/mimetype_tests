LOWER AND UPPER PAGING BANDS
AUCTION SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 30, 2001

TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS REGARDING ACCEPTABLE BIDS

BIDDER SEMINAR SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2001

Report No. AUC-01-40-F (Auction No. 40)

By this Public Notice, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau ("Bureau") announces technical 
modifications to previously released information as well as new dates and deadlines with respect 
to the upcoming auction of lower and upper paging bands scheduled for October 30, 2001 
("Auction No. 40").

With the exception of information modified by this Public Notice, the information provided in 
previous public notices regarding Auction No. 40 remains unchanged.   As previously 
announced, all short-form applications (FCC Form 175) previously filed for Auction No. 40 have 
been deemed ineffective and purged from the FCC's computer system. 

Since the release of the Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice, the Bureau modified the 
formula for determining the defined increments used to calculate acceptable bids.  Previously, at 
the time of the Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice, the formula to be used was:  Defined 
Increment = Rounded (Standing High Bid*Factor ) - Standing High Bid.   (In the absence of a 
standing high bid, the minimum opening bid is used in its place.)  The Auction No. 40 
Procedures Public Notice indicated that the product of the Standing High Bid (or minimum 
opening bid) and the Factor would be rounded to the nearest $100 for results below $10,000 and 
to the nearest $1,000 for amounts above $10,000. 

By this Public Notice, the Bureau announces a modification to the method of rounding.  The 
product of the Standing High Bid (or minimum opening bid) and the Factor will be rounded as 
follows:  amounts below $1,000 will be rounded to the nearest $10; amounts above $1,000 but 
below $10,000 will be rounded to the nearest $100; and amounts above $10,000 will be rounded 
to the nearest $1,000.  In all other respects, acceptable bids will be calculated as described in the 
Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice. 

The Bureau also has changed the number of acceptable bids higher than the minimum acceptable 
bid for each round.  In the Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice, the Bureau announced that 
in each round, eligible bidders would be able to place either the minimum accepted bid or any of 
nine higher bids, each higher bid being equal to the minimum accepted bid plus one to nine times 
the relevant defined increment.   By this Public Notice, the Bureau announces that, in each 
round, eligible bidders will be able to place either the minimum accepted bid or any of eight 
higher bids, each higher bid being equal to the minimum accepted bid plus one to eight times the 
relevant defined increment.

Additionally, the Bureau announces key dates for Auction No. 40 events, including the bidder 
seminar scheduled for Wednesday, September 5, 2001.  Participants planning to attend the bidder 
seminar must register using the attached form by Friday, August 31, 2001.

exception of those other bidders with whom the applicant has entered into agreements and

  See, e.g., Lower and Upper Paging Bands Auction Scheduled for June 26, 2001; Notice and Filing Requirements, 
Minimum Opening Bids, Upfront Payments and Other Procedural Issues, Public Notice, DA 01-850 (rel. April 9, 
2001), 66 Fed Reg. 21143 ("Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice").
  Auction of Licenses for Lower and Upper Paging Bands Postponed Until October 30, 2001, Public Notice, DA 01-
1307 (rel. May 25, 2001), 66 Fed. Reg. 30467 ("Auction No. 40 Postponement Public Notice").
  The Factor is determined based on the percentage of the high bid used to calculate the defined increment.  At the 
outset of the auction, the Bureau will use twenty percent (20%), in which case the Factor will be 1.2.  The Bureau 
has discretion to change the percentage during the auction.  If the percentage is thirty percent, for example, the 
Factor will be 1.3.  In addition, the Bureau has discretion during Stage III of the auction to use a second, smaller 
percentage when calculating the increment used to set acceptable bids higher than the minimum acceptable bid.  In 
all other respects, any such smaller defined increment will be calculated in the same manner as the defined 
increment used to set the minimum acceptable bid.  Advance notice of the Bureau's decision to exercise its 
discretion with regard to acceptable bids in any manner will be announced via the Automated Auction System.
