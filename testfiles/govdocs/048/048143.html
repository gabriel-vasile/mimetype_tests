<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>This lecture presents the results of the most recent Greek,
and Roman excavations at Troy, in northwestern Turkey. Work has concentrated
primarily on the theater, temple of Athena, the Bouleuterion or Council
House, and the Sanctuary of the Samothracian Gods. The Bronze Age fortifications
and Roman houses in the Lower City have also been extensively investigated.
Excavation thus far has clarified the rise in the city's fortunes after
Alexander the Great, its reconstruction by Augustus and his Julio-Claudian
successors, and the manipulation of its legendary heritage. Also included
in the lecture is a discussion of several new monumental tombs recently
discovered near Troy, which contain gold jewelry, musical instruments,
and painted marble sarcophagi.</font>
