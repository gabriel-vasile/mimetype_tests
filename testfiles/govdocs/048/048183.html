 <center><table width=90% border=0><tr><td>The recognition of genital chlamydial infection as an important public 
health problem was made first by the recognition of its role in acute clinical syndromes, 
as well as in serious reproductive and ocular complications, and secondly by 
our awareness of its prevalence when diagnostic tests became widely accessible.  
The recent availability of effective single dose oral antimicrobial therapy and 
sensitive molecular amplification tests that allow the use of noninvasive specimens 
for diagnosis and screening is expected to have a major impact in reducing 
the prevalence of disease in the next decade. Clinical manifestations associated 
with <I>Chlamydia pneumoniae</I> infection continue to emerge beyond respiratory illness. 
In particular, its association with atherosclerosis deserves further 
investigation.<I> Chlamydia pecorum</I>, a pathogen of 
ruminants,<I> </I>was recently recognized as a new species. The continued application of molecular techniques will likely elucidate 
an expanding role for chlamydiae in human and animal diseases, delineate 
the phylogenetic relationships among chlamydial species and within the 
eubacteria domain, and provide tools for detection and control of chlamydial infections. </td></tr></table></center><p>
 Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow in eukaryotic 
cells and cause a wide spectrum of human disease <a href="#tab">(Table)</a>. Species were 
grouped according to their biologic and biochemical properties and a greater than 
95% homology in their 16s ribosomal RNA sequences <a href="#ref1">(1)</a>. Molecular analyses led to 
the reclassification of some <I>Chlamydia psittaci 
</I>strains as <I>Chlamydia pneumoniae, </I>a human pathogen, and 
<I>Chlamydia pecorum, </I>a pathogen of ruminants. Given 
the diverse host range of <I>C. psittaci </I>strains, more reclassification within this 
species may be likely.

<P> The oldest reported disease associated with 
<I>C. trachomatis</I> infection is trachoma, a sequela of ocular infection. This disease was described in China and 
in the Ebers papyrus in Egypt thousands of years ago and continues to be a 
major cause of preventable blindness, with an estimated 500 million cases of 
active trachoma worldwide (seven million include blindness from conjunctival 
scarring and eyelid deformities [2]). In the last two decades, genital chlamydial 
infection has been identified as a major public health problem because of the 
recognition that chlamydial infection is associated with disease syndromes such 
as nongonococcal urethritis, mucopurulent cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory 
disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and tubal infertility. The World Health 
Organization estimated 89 million new cases of genital chlamydial infections worldwide in 
1995 <a href="#ref3">(3)</a>. In the United States, each year an estimated four million new cases occur 
and 50,000 women become infertile as a result of infection <a href="#ref4">(4)</a>. 
<P> <I>C. psittaci</I> infection, acquired through respiratory droplet transmission of 
chlamydiae from infected birds, has been considered for many years an occupational hazard for 
employees of pet shops and poultry processing plants <a href="#ref5">(5)</a>. Sources of human 
<I>C. psittaci </I>infection other than infected birds have been identified and may
<br>
<center>[end of page 307]</center>
<br>
be more common than currently 
recognized. Detection of <I>C. psittaci</I> in household cats and breeding catteries illustrates the 
expanding number of chlamydial diseases in animals that are transmissible to humans <a href="#ref6">(6,7)</a>.
<P> <I>C. pneumoniae</I> is a human pathogen recognized as an important cause of 
respiratory illness <a href="#ref8">(8)</a>. Approximately 40% to 60% of adult populations around the world have 
antibodies to <I>C. pneumoniae</I>, which suggests that the infection is extraordinarily prevalent, 
and reinfection is common. Current interest centers on the emerging  role of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> infection in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and asthma. 
<h3><B>Biology of Chlamydiae: An Update</B></h3>
Chlamydiae have a unique biphasic life cycle with dimorphic forms that are 
functionally and morphologically distinct. An extracellular form, the elementary body (EB), is 
infectious but metabolically inactive. Once endocytosed, the EB differentiates into a larger 
pleomorphic form called the reticulate body (RB), which replicates by binary fission. The 
precise mechanism by which EBs attach and gain entry into the host cell is unknown. Recent 
work suggests that chlamydiae employ a molecular mimic of heparan sulfate to attach 
to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) receptors on eukaryotic cell surfaces <a href="#ref9">(9)</a>. GAG appears to form 
a trimolecular complex with the host cell since (EB) infectivity is inhibited by the addition 
of heparan or heparan sulfate to culture, and pretreatment of EBs with heparan sulfate 
lyase abolishes EB infectivity. The mechanism of endocytic uptake remains unclear. Once 
inside the host cell, chlamydiae reside in a membrane-bound vacuole that can evade 
phagolysosomal fusion. The endosome is transported to the distal region of the Golgi apparatus 
and incorporates host-derived sphingolipids into the inclusion membrane <a href="#ref10">(10,11)</a>. Thus it 
appears that chlamydiae are able to intercept host vesicular traffic bound for the plasma membrane 
to sequester lipids and possibly other host substances synthesized in the Golgi. Subversion 
of host vesicular traffic may represent a dual advantage for chlamydiae in obtaining 
materials from the host for its metabolism as well as in modifying the inclusion membrane to 
evade lysosomal fusion and immune detection. 
<P> Chlamydiae are considered energy parasites because they lack the enzymes of the 
electron transport chain and thus require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nutrient
<br>
<center>[end of page 308]</center>
<br>
 resources 
from the host to fuel their metabolism and replication. Chlamydiae are incapable of 
de<I> </I>novo nucleotide biosynthesis and are dependent on host nucleotide pools <a href="#ref12">(12)</a>. In spite of 
the successful selection of various metabolic mutants of 
<I>C. trachomatis</I>, progress in elucidating the host-parasite metabolic relationship has been hampered by multiple salvage 
metabolic pathways in the host and the lack of a genetic shuttle system for chlamydiae. 
<h3><I>C. trachomatis</I></h3>
<strong>Epidemiology</strong>
<br> Genital infections due to <I>C. 
trachomatis</I> are the most common sexually 
transmitted diseases in many industrialized countries 
<a href="#ref3">(3)</a>. Each year, an estimated four million new 
cases occur in the United States and three million in Europe. These infections present 
unique problems for public health control programs because 50% to 70% of infections in women 
(and perhaps men) are clinically silent. Unrecognized and untreated, the bacteria may 
remain infectious in the host for months and be readily transmitted to sex partners. 
Furthermore, most reported infections occur in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Young women with 
cervical chlamydial infections are at risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to 
long-term reproductive sequelae such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal 
infertility. Babies born to infected mothers are also at risk for conjunctivitis and pneumonia. The 
annual direct and indirect costs of genital chlamydial infections in the United States are estimated 
at $2.4 billion <a href="#ref4">(4)</a>. 
<P> Control programs emphasizing early diagnosis, targeted screening, partner 
notification, and effective treatment have led to a slow decline in the incidence of genital 
chlamydial infection in countries where these programs have been implemented <a href="#ref13">(13)</a>. The true rate 
of decline may be higher than the reported rate because of increased sensitivity of 
laboratory testing and more widespread screening. In women, screening of chlamydial infection at 
the time of Papanicolaou tests, prenatal visits, or attendance at family planning or 
pregnancy counseling clinics have been effective. In asymptomatic men, who are less likely to 
access care, asymptomatic infection is not adequately addressed by current public health programs. 
<P> In contrast to genital chlamydial infection, trachoma is a household disease that 
has disappeared in many parts of the world because of improved living conditions and hygiene. 
In trachoma-endemic areas, severe disease leading to scarring and blindness may be the 
result of frequent reinfection or persistent infection in those whose immune system does not 
mount an adequate response to clear the infection. For both ocular and genital chlamydial 
infections, recent advances in diagnostic and screening technology and single dose antimicrobial 
therapy will likely have a<I> </I>significant impact on the efficacy of disease control programs and 
the opportunity for eventual disease eradication. 
<p><B> Laboratory Diagnosis</B>
<br> Since curative antibiotic therapy for chlamydial infections is readily available 
and inexpensive, early diagnosis is an essential component of public health programs to 
control these infections. The goals of early identification are to interrupt the chain of transmission 
in the community and to prevent long-term sequelae. Isolation of the organism in cell 
culture had been the traditional method for laboratory diagnosis and has remained the method 
of choice for  medicolegal specimens because of its specificity. However, culture 
requires expensive equipment, technical expertise, and stringent transport conditions to 
preserve specimen viability; it also has a turnaround time of 2 to 3 days. Hence, in many 
settings, culture has been replaced by antigen-detection methods, such as enzyme immunoassays 
(EIA) and direct fluorescence assays (DFA), which have less demanding transport requirements 
and can provide results on the same day. EIAs are suitable for public health laboratories 
serving large geographic areas because specimens are stable in transport under ambient 
conditions and are inexpensive because they allow specimens to be processed in batches by 
automated equipment. Assays are typically based on the capture of the 

<br>
<center>[end of page 309]</center>
<br>
chlamydial 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies linked to a solid-phase support. 
Early problems with low specificity because of cross-reactivity between the chlamydial LPS 
and that of other gram-negative bacteria have been largely overcome by confirmation with DFA 
or a blocking antibody assay. With a lower detection limit of 10,000 elementary bodies, EIA 
lacks sensitivity as a screening assay, especially for asymptomatic men <a href="#ref14">(14,15)</a>. Nucleic 
acid-based hybridization probe tests offer higher specificity but no substantial improvement 
on sensitivity <a href="#ref15">(15)</a>. Nucleic acid amplification tests based on polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), and transcription-mediated amplification technology are 
now commercially available. The precision of nucleic acid hybridization and the 
rapid amplification of a single gene target facilitated the design of diagnostic tests with 
specificities in excess of 99% and lower detection limits of 1-10 EBs. In addition, these tests offer all 
the advantages of nonculture tests in terms of ambient specimen transport, 
batching, automation, and rapid processing time of 4 hours. Duplex testing for the 
simultaneous detection of chlamydial and gonococcal DNA from a single specimen is also 
commercially available in some countries. 
<P> A major advantage of the increased sensitivity of these molecular amplification tests 
is that noninvasive specimens, such as urine, can be used for testing. The ease of collection 
and the lack of sampling bias of urine specimens make screening feasible in settings 
outside physicians' offices. PCR assays on urethral or cervical swabs for the laboratory diagnosis 
of genital chlamydial infection in symptomatic men and women show sensitivities of 89% 
to 100% and specificities of 99% to 100% compared with the traditional culture or PCR 
test, confirmed by a second PCR reaction targeting a different gene <a href="#ref16">(16-18)</a>. For urine 
specimens, PCR assays show sensitivities of 87% to 100% for men and 92% for women and specificities 
of 96% to 100% for men and 95% for women <a href="#ref18">(18-20)</a>. In a study of 447 women with a 
prevalence of infection of 6%, the sensitivity of urine LCR was 96% compared with 56% for cervical 
swab culture, 78% for cervical swab EIA, and 37% for urine EIA <a href="#ref21">(21)</a>. For men in the same study, 
the sensitivity of urine LCR was 96% compared with 68% for urine EIA, and 38% for 
urethral swab culture. In a multicenter study of 2,132 women, cervical swab LCR showed a 
sensitivity of 87% to 98% compared with a sensitivity of 52% to 92% for culture <a href="#ref22">(22)</a>. In LCR studies, 
a true positive was defined as culture positive or LCR positive confirmed with DFA or 
another LCR assay with a different DNA target. Thus it appears that molecular 
amplification techniques for the detection of <I>C. 
trachomatis</I> in urine specimens from both men and 
women are a substantial improvement over conventional diagnostic and screening methods and 
will provide an important tool for decreasing the reservoir of infection, especially in 
asymptomatic men. 
<P> In the diagnostic laboratory, molecular techniques present different problems 
for specimen handling and interpretation of results than cell culture or antigen detection 
<a href="#ref15">(15)</a>. Inherent in the increased sensitivity of these molecular techniques is the potential for 
false-positive results due to cross contamination between specimens, and run-to-run 
contamination from equipment, reagents, and supplies. These problems can be overcome by 
observing stringent rules for specimen preparation (e.g., dedicated equipment) and separating 
specimen processing and reagent preparation areas to prevent contamination. Enzymatic 
or photochemical sterilization can be used to eliminate run-to-run contamination. 
False-negative results may be due to substances in specimens inhibitory to enzymes used 
for amplification. Known inhibitors include phosphate ions,  heparin, heme, crystals in the 
urine specimens, and detergents used in specimen processing. Internal controls are 
now commercially available to detect false negatives. 
<P> Although molecular tests are more expensive than EIA, cost-effectiveness studies 
should take into consideration the benefits of averting the enormous costs of long-term 
reproductive sequelae in women with undetected infections, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and 
HIV infection. Targeted screening of women to detect cervical chlamydial infection decreases 
the incidence

<br>
<center>[end of page 310]</center>
<br>
 of symptomatic PID <a href="#ref23">(23)</a>. Patients with genital gonococcal or chlamydial 
infections are also at increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) <a href="#ref24">(24)</a>. Although the risk 
for HIV may be lower in patients with chlamydial infection than in those with genital 
ulcer disease, the higher prevalence of chlamydial infection in some populations means that 
the population attributable risk for HIV may be substantially higher for chlamydia. 
Shortening the duration of infectiousness by early diagnosis and treatment could have a major impact 
on risk reduction for HIV infection. A recent study showed that strengthening 
sexually transmitted disease control through education, access to diagnosis, and treatment 
reduced the incidence of HIV by 42% in study communities in Tanzania over 2 years <a href="#ref25">(25)</a>. 
<p><B> Treatment</B>
<br> Azithromycin prescribed as a single oral 1-g dose is equivalent to the traditional 
7-day regimen of doxycycline for treating ocular and uncomplicated genital chlamydial 
infections <a href="#ref26">(26-28)</a>. Compared with conventional therapy, azithromycin has excellent 
pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as increased bioavailability; lower incidence of gastrointestinal 
tract side effects; and increased concentration in mucus, macrophages, and tissues with a half 
life of 5 to 7 days <a href="#ref29">(29)</a>. These characteristics allow for single dosing, which alleviates the 
problem of patient noncompliance with multiday regimens. With single-dose therapy, the potential 
for reinfection due to earlier resumption of sexual activity is a concern. At present, there 
are limited data on the use of single-dose therapy in adolescents, during pregnancy, and 
for syndromes such as PID, cervicitis, and nongonococcal urethritis <a href="#ref30">(30-33)</a>. Studies are 
needed to determine if these regimens achieve clinical and microbiologic cure while 
preserving fertility and preventing further tissue damage to the upper genital tract. 
<P> Although the higher cost of azithromycin may be prohibitive for its use in 
resource-limited settings, selective use in persons at high risk or in those with a history of noncompliance 
may prove cost-effective. The cost of retreatment as a result of noncompliance and the 
additional cost of contact tracing can make single dose azithromycin more cost-effective than 
doxycycline <a href="#ref34">(34)</a>.
<p><B> Pathogenesis</B>
<br> Interesting findings in three areas of <I>C. 
trachomatis</I> pathogenesis further delineate the complex bacteria-host relationship in disease and may have implications for vaccine 
design. These new observations include the extensive but unexpected polymorphism of the 
major outer membrane protein (MOMP), the evidence for genetic susceptibility to disease, and 
the association of antibody response to the 60 kDa heat shock protein (CHSP60) with 
the development of adverse sequelae following ocular and genital infections. 
<p><B> Polymorphism of MOMP</B>
<br> The ecologic success of a pathogen is determined in part by its ability to evade 
host defenses. With <I>C. trachomatis,</I> MOMP is a major target for protective host immune 
responses, such as neutralizing antibodies and possibly, protective T-cell responses <a href="#ref35">(35,36)</a>. The basis 
for MOMP antigenic variation is allelic polymorphism at the omp-1 locus, and immune 
selection appears to be occurring in host populations frequently exposed to 
<I>C. trachomatis</I> <a href="#ref37">(37)</a>. Each variant apparently only infects hosts lacking serovar-specific immunity to that variant, 
and the ecologic success of chlamydiae may be due to their ability, under immune 
selection pressure, to generate successive allelic variants <a href="#ref36">(36)</a>. DNA sequence analyses of isolates 
from different populations show that most MOMP variants are results of single amino 
acid substitutions <a href="#ref37">(37-39)</a>. Recombination of  sequences from MOMP during mixed infections 
may also have occurred. Recombinant variants with mosaic sequences of MOMP from 
different strains were especially frequent in persons with high rates of infection. MOMP variants 
were also more frequently found in women with PID than in those with lower genital 
tract infections, which suggests a relationship between sequence variation in MOMP and 
more invasive disease <a href="#ref39">(39)</a>. Clearly, the extensive polymorphism of MOMP, the tempo for 
variation, and the mechanism of immune selection have

<br>
<center>[end of page 311]</center>
<br>
important implications for vaccine design <a href="#ref35">(35)</a>.
<p><B> Genetic Susceptibility to Disease</B>
<br> HLA B27 has been associated with Reiter's syndrome following genital 
chlamydial infection <a href="#ref40">(40)</a>. Only a subset of infected persons appear to have long-term complications 
after acute or repeated chlamydial infections. In a study of 306 persons from 
trachoma-endemic communities in the Gambia, the HLA class I antigen HLA-A28 was significantly 
more common in case-patients than in age-, sex-, and location-matched controls <a href="#ref41">(41)</a>. In 
particular, the A*6802 allele was overrepresented among case-patients. It may be that 
immunopathology is associated with HLA-A*6802 restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. The frequency 
of HLA class II alleles was similar among cases and controls suggesting that, if class 
II restricted T-cell responses are important in immunopathology, they were not targeted 
at single epitopes. No individual HLA type was associated with protection from scarring, 
which suggests that multiple or complex T-cell responses may be involved in protective 
immunity. Susceptibility to chlamydial PID in a study of sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya, has 
been associated with a HLA class I allele, HLA A-31 <a href="#ref42">(42)</a>. Studies are needed to determine 
whether susceptibility to silent PID, ectopic pregnancy, and progression to tubal factor infertility 
are associated with HLA class I restricted immune responses. 
<p><B> Role of CHSP60 in Immunopathology
</B>
<br> Antibody response to a 57 kDa chlamydial protein was initially observed more 
frequently in women with tubal infertility than in controls <a href="#ref43">(43)</a>. This protein was subsequently 
identified as a heat shock protein of the GroEL family of stress proteins. The association 
between antibody response to CHSP60 and PID, ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and trachoma 
<a href="#ref44">(44-48)</a> has been documented. The risk factors associated with CHSP60 antibody response 
are similar to those for chlamydial PID and include older age and chronic or repeated 
infections. There appears to be genetic restriction for the CHSP60 antibody response. In a study 
of trachoma in the Gambia, HLA DRB1*0701 was positively correlated with CHSP60 
response, while DRB1*0301 and DQB1*0501 were negatively associated <a href="#ref48">(48)</a>. However, these 
alleles were not associated with trachoma and may reflect linkage disequilibrium between HLA 
class II alleles and polymorphic markers for other immune response genes. 
<P> At present, it remains unclear whether antibody to CHSP60 is causally involved 
in chlamydial immunopathogenesis or is merely a marker of persistent chlamydial 
infection <a href="#ref35">(35)</a>. Both may be true. In cells persistently infected with 
<I>C. trachomatis,</I> the expression of CHSP60 is normal, while other antigens, such as MOMP, are downregulated, thus 
providing continued antigenic stimulation for the CHSP60 antibody response observed in persons 
with long-term sequelae <a href="#ref49">(49)</a>. T-cell responses to chlamydial antigens, including CHSP60, 
were more depressed in persons with trachoma than in those who recovered from infection 
without sequelae <a href="#ref50">(50)</a>. Persons with trachoma or reproductive sequelae have high levels of 
serum antibody response to <I>C. trachomatis</I>. In guinea pigs and in gene knock-out mice, both B- 
and T- cell responses have been important in immunity and resolution of infection 
<a href="#ref51">(51,52)</a>. Therefore, persons with long-term sequelae may have predominantly 
Th<sup>2</sup> responses, characterized by high levels of B-cell response and inadequate T-cell responses that may 
not clear the infection thus leading to chronic inflammation. Immunopathology may also be 
the result of a hit-and-run mechanism in which immune response to CHSP60 breaks 
self-tolerance to the human HSP60 and leads to an autoimmune reaction that results in 
tissue damage <a href="#ref35">(35)</a>. 
<h3><B><I>C. psittaci </B></I></h3>
<B>Epidemiology</B>
<br> Human infections with <I>C. psittaci</I> are caused by occupational exposure to infected birds 
or household handling of nasal discharge or fecal material from pet birds. Birds can be 
healthy carriers of <I>C. psittaci</I>. Increased shedding and susceptibility to disease occur under 
conditions of stress such
<br>
<center>[end of page 312]</center>
<br>
 as shipping, crowding, starvation, or egg laying. Person-to-person 
transmission is rare but has been observed in outbreaks. In the 
<I>C. psittaci</I> pandemic of 1929-30, infected birds from Argentina were shipped to different parts of the world causing outbreaks 
of infection worldwide with death rates of up to 40% <a href="#ref5">(5)</a>. Since then 
<I>C. psittaci</I> has been isolated from more than 130 species of birds. Thus, all avian species, including wild birds, should 
be regarded as potential sources of zoonosis.
<P> Reports of outbreaks of psittacosis in duck and turkey processing plants show that, 
in spite of availability of medicated feed, diagnostic testing, and screening of poultry, 
<I>C. psittaci</I> infections continue to be a public health concern <a href="#ref53">(53,54)</a>. High rates of chlamydial infection 
in household cats and asymptomatic carriage of <I>C. psittaci 
</I> in cats from breeding catteries raise the possibility that human 
<I>C. psittaci </I>infection from pets other than birds may 
be underdiagnosed <a href="#ref6">(6,7</a>,<a href="#ref55">55,56)</a>. Studies of animal and cellular tropism of various strains 
within the species may give important clues to the pathogenesis of 
<I>C. psittaci</I> infections. 

<P> <B>Clinical Manifestations</B>
<br> Human infection caused by exposure to infected birds or poultry is manifested as a 
flulike illness characterized by fever, chills, headache, and less frequently, cough, myalgias, rash, 
 arthralgia and joint swelling, and atypical pneumonia in more severe cases. The 
incubation period is 6 to 19 days. Infections transmitted from ruminants are rare, but 
placentitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and spontaneous abortion in women exposed 
to infected sheep during lambing have been reported <a href="#ref56">(56)</a>. Zoonoses associated with exposure 
to ruminants are characterized by multiorgan involvement often resulting in hepatic and 
renal dysfunction and endocarditis. Human conjunctivitis, glomerulonephritis, and 
endocarditis caused by <I>C. psittaci </I>from infected cats and pigeons have been reported <a href="#ref55">(55)</a>. 

<P> <B>Diagnosis and Treatment</B>
<br> Serodiagnosis has been the method of choice for human 
<I>C. psittaci</I> infections because culture is technically demanding and represents an important biohazard. The 
complement fixation assay is genus specific. Its interpretations should depend on clinical symptoms 
and patient history. The microimmunofluorescence (MIF) assay can detect species-specific IgM 
or IgG antibodies. Antigen detection methods, such as EIA, have been used, but they are 
based on the capture of the genus-specific LPS. PCR assays are not yet commercially available 
but can offer lower detection limits of 10 EBs or less <a href="#ref57">(57,58)</a>. Molecular techniques not 
only provide more sensitive and rapid diagnosis than serology, but they also provide 
the opportunity for fingerprinting strains. This is particularly useful in outbreak 
investigations and for the confirmation of zoonotic transmission from infected birds or animals. 
<P> The recommended treatment for <I>C. 
psittaci</I> infection is 250 mg of tetracycline 4 
times daily for 21 days. Although the death rate is low, prolonged hospitalization may be 
required. Protracted recovery and high incidence of relapse have also been noted. 
<h3><I>C. pneumoniae</I></h3>
<B>Epidemiology</B>
<br> <I>C. pneumoniae</I> is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections and accounts for 
6% to 10% of community-acquired pneumonia <a href="#ref8">(8)</a>. Infection is usually mild or asymptomatic 
but can be severe, especially in the elderly, probably as a result of underlying illness, 
impaired mucociliary clearance, and immune senescence. Unlike 
<I>C. psittaci</I>, <I>C. pneumoniae</I> is spread by person-to-person transmission by respiratory droplet and has an incubation period of 7 
to 21 days. Outbreaks of infection have been reported in families, schools, military barracks, 
and nursing homes. Coinfection with viruses (e.g., influenza and respiratory syncytial virus) 
and with bacteria has been reported frequently. Seroepidemiologic studies show that 
most primary infections occur during school age and the early teenage years; among 
adults seroprevalence is 40% to 70%. Reinfections are common, and serum antibodies do not 
appear to be protective.

<P> <B>Laboratory Diagnosis</B>
<br> Accurate and rapid laboratory diagnostic methods leading to improved patient 
care, appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy, and better understanding of the epidemiology 
of this emerging pathogen <a href="#ref59">(59,60)</a> are needed. Culture is highly specific but is 
technically demanding often requiring multiple passages over a period of weeks to show a positive 
result. <I>C. pneumoniae </I>has been isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy persons, but the rate 
of asymptomatic carriage in a normal population is unknown <a href="#ref61">(61)</a>. 
<P> Antigen detection tests, such as EIA and DFA, and molecular detection methods, such 
as PCR assays, provide a rapid diagnosis without stringent transport requirements. 
Monoclonal antibodies specific for <I>C. pneumoniae 
</I>are now commercially available for DFA and for 
culture confirmation <a href="#ref62">(62)</a>. PCR assays have lower detection limits of 10 to 100 EBs <a href="#ref57">(57,58</a>,<a href="#ref65">63-65)</a>. 
The protocol developed by Tong and Sillis amplifies a target sequence conserved between 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> and <I>C. psittaci</I> and hence can detect DNA from either pathogen in a single 
assay <a href="#ref57">(57)</a>. A nested PCR procedure is used to differentiate between the 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I>  and <I>C. </I> <I>psittaci 
</I>amplicons. The protocol of Rasmussen et al. amplifies a genus-specific 
target, followed by species differentiation using restriction enzyme digestion <a href="#ref58">(58)</a>. The 
development of multiplex PCR assays containing primers specific for a panel of respiratory pathogens 
will be useful.
<P> The MIF assay is the standard method used for chlamydia serology today. 
Ekman compared the performance of the complement fixation (CF), LPS-based EIA, and MIF tests 
for the serodiagnosis of <I>C. pneumoniae</I> and 
<I>C. psittaci</I> infections in an elderly population 
and found that the CF test has a sensitivity of 10% compared with 88% and 72% for MIF and 
EIA, respectively <a href="#ref66">(66)</a>. IgM antibodies were only detected in 11% of the cases. IgM antibodies 
are rarely produced in reinfections with <I>C. 
pneumoniae.</I> CF tests may be useful in early 
initial infections as LPS antibodies are produced early in infection. Serodiagnosis may be made 
by demonstrating a fourfold rise in CF or EIA titer in paired sera taken a week apart, 
compared with the 3 weeks or more that it takes by MIF to demonstrate seroconversion. 
Because reinfections are common and LPS-based serologic tests are not useful in reinfection, the 
MIF assay remains the most useful and specific tool for the serodiagnosis of respiratory 
infections due to <I>C. pneumoniae.</I>  

<P> <B>Treatment</B>
<br> The newer macrolides, clarithromycin and azithromycin, with longer tissue half-life 
and concentration in mucus and macrophages and improved bioavailability can 
potentially provide shorter and better-tolerated regimens for the treatment of respiratory infections 
due to <I>C. pneumoniae</I> than doxycycline or erythromycin, which have to be given for 2 to 3 
weeks to avoid relapse. They may also be preferred for empiric therapy as they provide 
broader coverage than erythromycin against etiologic agents in community-acquired pneumonia. 
The optimal duration of treatment for respiratory infections due to 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> needs to be determined since studies with documented microbiologic cure are limited, and recurrence 
of infection is common <a href="#ref67">(67)</a>. 

<P><B> Association with Atherosclerosis</B>
<br> The association of <I>C. pneumoniae</I> infection with coronary heart disease and 
acute myocardial infarction was first made on the basis of elevated IgG and IgA antibodies and 
LPS containing immune complexes in 50% to 60% in patients with coronary heart disease or 
acute myocardial infarction compared with 7% to 12% in the controls. This study did not take 
into account risk factors for heart disease such as smoking, hypertension, or serum lipid 
levels. Subsequently, several cross-sectional studies involving 46 to 461 study participants 
have shown that a similar association of IgG antibodies against 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> with coronary artery disease and carotid disease with adjusted odds ratios of 1.6 to 2.6 after controlling 
for known risk factors <a href="#ref68">(68-72)</a>. Electron microscopy, PCR, and immunochemical evidence of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> in coronary arterial fatty streaks and atheromatous plaques have also 
been described <a href="#ref72">(72,73)</a>. 

<br>
<center>[end of page 314]</center>
<br>

<P> Two more recent studies reported equivocal findings. In one, 
<I>C. pneumoniae </I>was detected in 79% of 90 coronary atherectomy specimens from symptomatic patients by 
direct immunofluorescence and was confirmed by electron microscopy. Only 4% of 24 
control nonatherosclerotic coronary specimens were positive for 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> <a href="#ref74">(74)</a>. The 24 control samples included 12 from heart transplant patients whose arteries were damaged, but not 
by atherosclerosis. The absence of <I>C. 
pneumoniae</I> in these tissue samples argues against its 
role as a passenger recruited to the site of injury in macrophages. In the other study, 
<I>C. pneumoniae </I>was not detected in 58 coronary atheroma specimens by culture, PCR, or 
electron microscopy <a href="#ref75">(75)</a>. The seroprevalence of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> in 65 case-patients was not different 
<I> </I>from that in 28 asymptomatic controls. In fact, IgG titers were higher in controls than in 
case-patients. Nonetheless, data suggest that the association of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> with atherosclerosis is consistent and biologically plausible. Whether 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> is causally involved or is a bystander trapped in the atherogenic process is unclear.  
<P> The sustained IgA and IgG antibody levels against 
<I>C. pneumoniae </I>in persons with atherosclerosis suggest that chronic infection may be frequent after infection. The site 
of colonization for a chronic <I>C. pneumoniae</I> infection may be in the alveolar macrophages of 
the lung. Thus the initial event in atherogenesis may be the formation of the fatty streak. 
Fatty streaks consist of lipid-laden macrophages derived from blood monocytes and T 
lymphocytes attracted to the arterial subintima. Conversion of the fatty streak to atheroma depends 
on many factors, e.g., the proliferation and differentiation of smooth muscle cells and 
fibroblasts. Chronic infection with <I>C. 
pneumoniae</I> may result from organisms harbored in 
macrophages trapped in the arterial wall. Growth of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> in endothelial, smooth muscle cells, 
and macrophages from peripheral blood monocytes has been reported <a href="#ref76">(76)</a>. Injured blood 
vessels initiate events that promote thrombosis and platelet adhesion at the site of injury. 
These events in turn promote atherosclerosis. Tissue injury through 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I>-specific circulating immune complexes in patients with chronic heart disease may be an 
alternate mechanism or compounding atherogenesis. The idea that an infectious agent is involved 
in the atherogenic process is not new, but the role of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> in this process needs to be defined.

<P> <B>Association with Asthma</B>
<br> The prevalence of asthma, an important chronic respiratory disorder, has been 
steadily increasing. Viral and <I>Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae</I> infections have been implicated in exacerbating the disease. The first observations on the association of 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> infection with the exacerbation of asthma were made in 1986 when wheezing was associated with 
acute bronchitis due to <I> pneumoniae </I>infection <a href="#ref8">(8</a>,<a href="#ref77">77)</a>. Subsequent studies showed that 
exacerbation of asthma due to <I>C. pneumoniae</I>  infection may occur in 1% to 11% of respiratory infections 
in adults as well as children. The mechanism underlying the association is unclear. 
Preliminary results in animal models suggest that 
<I>C. pneumoniae</I> can produce persistent infection 
and cause pulmonary inflammation, and production of chlamydia-specific IgE antibodies 
in children with reactive airway disease has been demonstrated <a href="#ref78">(78)</a>. A possible scenario for 
this association is an antigen-specific allergic reaction with the release of 
pulmonary inflammatory mediators and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways, 
causing airway epithelial damage. Activated T lymphocytes and cytokines appear to play a 
critical role as mediators of persistent inflammation in asthma. IL-4 is essential for B 
lymphocytes class switching from IgG to IgE. In vitro human IgE synthesis is reciprocally regulated by 
IL-4 and interferon-gamma. Thus cytokines from a 
Th2 response to infection would facilitate and promote IgE production. Immunotherapy or glucocorticoid therapy targeting 
CD4+ T cells may decrease the proinflammatory role of these cells and alleviate symptoms of asthma. The 
role of persistent infection in the pathogenesis of asthma merits further study because, 
unlike

<br>
<center>[end of page 315]</center>
<br>
viral infections, <I>C. pneumoniae</I> infections can be eradicated through 
appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

<P>
<P>
<P> The hallmark of chlamydial infection is that most persons infected have mild to 
no apparent clinical disease and some have severe disease. Asymptomatic infection not 
only creates a problem in detecting cases for disease control programs but also contributes to 
the development of long-term adverse sequelae, such as scarring trachoma from 
ocular<I> C. trachomatis</I> infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal 
factor infertility from genital <I>C. 
trachomatis</I> infection. The recent availability of effective 
single dose oral antimicrobial therapy and sensitive molecular amplification tests that allow the 
use of noninvasive specimens for diagnosis and screening is expected to have a major impact 
in reducing the prevalence of disease in the next decade. New information from cell biology 
as well as data from observing the interaction of chlamydiae with the host in terms of 
metabolic requirements and immune evasion strategies offer clues about the pathogenesis of 
chlamydia infections and may eventually lead to an effective vaccine. Sporadic outbreaks of 
psittacosis continue to be reported despite the use of medicated feed and the screening of poultry. 
Recent reports of <I>C. psittaci</I> in cats from breeding catteries illustrate the potential of 
zoonotic diseases transmissible to humans from pets other than birds. Two new species of 
chlamydiae, <I>C. pneumoniae</I> and <I>C. 
pecorum</I>, were desig-nated in 1989 and 1992, respectively. 
Clinical manifestations associated with <I>C. 
pneumoniae</I> infection continue to emerge. Possible links 
to chronic conditions, such as atherosclerosis and asthma remain to be elucidated. With 
the recent discovery of the involvement of infectious agents in other chronic conditions, it 
seems reasonable to apply molecular tools for chlamydial detection to identify their 
potential involvement in other etiologically undefined chronic inflammatory conditions such 
as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
