         <H3>MORE Division is Poised for Change</H3>
         
         <P>The Division of Minority Opportunities in Research
         (MORE), the umbrella organization created in 1991 to oversee
         NIGMS' minority programs, is responsible for developing and
         maintaining the overall NIGMS plans and policies for
         minority research and research training programs. The MORE
         Division is responsible for the activities of the Minority
         Access to Research Careers (MARC), Minority Biomedical
         Research Support (MBRS), and Special Initiatives programs.
         </P>
         
         <P>The two largest programs, MARC and MBRS, were created in
         the early 1970's to encourage and assist underrepresented
         minorities in pursuing careers in the biomedical sciences.
         Now, almost 25 years later, the MORE Division is reviewing
         and reassessing the programs' goals and objectives as well
         as the strategies used to meet them. As part of this review,
         in January 1995 the advisory council to the National
         Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) endorsed a set
         of "guiding principles" for all present and future programs
         of the MORE Division.</P>
         
         <P>These principles are:</P>
         
         <OL>
            <LI>The goals of the MORE Division will embody growth,
            improvement, and strengthening. Thus, MORE programs will
            be developmental rather than merely sustaining.
            Continuing, stable support will be contingent upon
            continued improvement.<BR>
            
            <BR>
            
            
            
            <LI>NIGMS programs under the MORE umbrella will develop a
            strategic plan that will have specific objectives with
            measurable outcomes. Those objectives will be explicitly
            addressed in the review and evaluation processes.<BR>
            
            <BR>
            
            
            
            <LI>Individual institutions funded by the MORE programs
            will have specific, measurable objectives. In general,
            and within legal and policy constraints, MORE programs
            will provide as much freedom and flexibility as possible
            to enable institutions to achieve their specific
            objectives.<BR>
            
            <BR>
            
            
            
            <LI>Outcomes and specific progress toward institutional
            objectives will be primary factors considered in the
            renewal of projects.<BR>
            
            <BR>
            
            
            
            <LI>MORE programs will promote systemic change.<BR>
            
         
         </OL>
         
         <P>Dr. Clifton Poodry, the director of the MORE Division
         since April 1994, talks about the meaning of these guiding
         principles:</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>Why was it important to articulate a set of
         guiding principles for the MORE Division?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>The mission of the MORE Division is to increase the
         participation of underrepresented minorities in biomedical
         research. The guiding principles set up a framework upon
         which our planning is based. The principles are really for
         "in house" use in planning; but they also provide a
         statement of direction for the MORE-supported programs at
         individual institutions.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>What is the implication of the programs' being
         developmental rather than sustaining?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>The MORE programs are intended to bring about change. We
         cannot be satisfied with the status quo, which includes an
         unacceptable degree of underrepresentation of some minority
         groups in biomedical research. When we imagine how much the
         MORE Division could reasonably expect to remedy the
         underrepresentation of minorities in science in the next 5,
         10, or 20 years, it is obvious that a commitment to constant
         progress toward the objective of increased representation is
         required. We will expect MORE-supported projects, whether
         they be for student or research development, to show a
         measurable difference as a result of the award. What will be
         important will be the ambitions of the particular
         institution. Our programs should play to and support those
         ambitions, but should not be seen as the source of funding
         for ongoing, status quo expenses.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>What programs will be affected?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>The principles apply to all programs under the MORE
         umbrella. They apply to ourselves in management at NIGMS, as
         well as to current and future grantees. The principles say
         that we encourage and support a culture of reflection and
         continuous improvement.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>What changes do you anticipate?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>The nature of the applications for some programs will
         change, possibly dramatically. In their proposals,
         applicants will need to express their ambitions, state their
         goals, and present specific, measurable objectives for a
         given time frame. Evaluation will be built in as an integral
         part of the grants rather than planned afterward. I imagine
         that the peer review process will look for lofty ambition
         combined with a good plan to achieve and evaluate that
         ambition. For renewal applications, the results of past
         funding and how they stack up against the goals and specific
         objectives of the institution will be critical. Since the
         goals and specific objectives would be unique to each
         institution, the difference or the added value of the funded
         activity will be most important. I hope that the nature of
         the awards will change in a fundamental way, namely, that
         institutions will have more flexibility in managing their
         projects and awarded funds to maximize the likelihood of
         achieving their goals. It is premature to discuss
         preliminary proposals for certain programs, but I will say
         that an objective of the MBRS Program is to provide a
         competitive level of funding for the best research in the
         portfolio.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>When will these changes take effect?</STRONG>
         </P>
         
         <P>There are a number of steps that have to be taken in the
         evolutionary process of the programs. We actively seek
         advice from the community, and we will provide continuing
         opportunity for such community input. The MORE staff
         discussed the proposed guiding principles at an ad hoc
         workshop and at a meeting with MARC and MBRS program
         directors before the advisory council to NIGMS endorsed the
         principles. As the MORE staff members offer revisions in
         policies or new program announcements, we will solicit
         comments widely. Only after comment, revision if necessary,
         and endorsement by the advisory council will any change take
         effect. Applications that are received before new
         announcements are made will be reviewed under the current
         criteria.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>What is meant by systemic change?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>The entire education and research system must be engaged
         in the effort to develop a diverse, inclusive biomedical
         research workforce. The effort must reach beyond the
         individual grants and fellowships of the MORE Division to
         include all activities of NIGMS.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>How do you picture the future of the MORE
         programs?</STRONG></P>
         
         <P>I would like to see the MORE programs develop into
         stronger programs that are better designed to meet the needs
         of an evolving and ethnically diverse scientific community,
         and with these changes, I see that happening.</P>

         <H3>NIH and NIGMS Enter the Information Superhighway</H3>
         
         <P>In accordance with Vice President Gore's National
         Performance Review, an effort that encourages government
         agencies to create and maintain programs that work better
         and cost less, NIH and NIGMS have begun to examine many of
         the procedures through which they do business with the
         scientific community.</P>
         
         <P>One of the procedures that NIH hopes to streamline is the
         grant application/communication process. NIH is exploring
         ways to enable the grantee community to submit applications
         and essential information electronically, thus eliminating
         the current reliance on the exchange of paper documents.
         However, to ensure that these new initiatives will be
         effective, NIH's and NIGMS' "customers" must have the needed
         electronic equipment to participate.</P>
         
         <P>Toward this end, NIGMS recently awarded each of its MARC
         programs a &#36;10,000 administrative supplement to be used to
         purchase a state-of-the-art computer, modem, laser printer,
         and technical assistance, if necessary.</P>
         
         <P>"Computers are an effective means of modern communication
         and are central to both the laboratory and the office," says
         Dr. Adolphus Toliver, MARC Program director. "Having access
         to a good computer is almost taken for granted at many
         institutions; nevertheless, this is not necessarily true for
         MARC-supported institutions. With these supplements," he
         adds, "our MARC participants will have better access to the
         'information superhighway' and the materials and procedures
         available through it."</P>
         
         <P>The MBRS Program is soliciting requests for
         administrative supplements to establish Internet and
         electronic mail capabilities for grantee institutions that
         currently lack such capabilities.</P>
         
         <P>NIGMS is also working to establish a presence on the
         Internet, in the form of a site (also known as a home page)
         on the World Wide Web (WWW). When the site is operational,
         it will offer NIGMS program and grant information, news, and
         staff information.</P>
         
         <P>"Having NIGMS on the Internet will give the grantee
         community easy electronic access to the NIGMS information
         they need whenever they need it," says Alisa Zapp Machalek, an NIGMS
         science writer who is developing the WWW site.</P>
         
         <P>The NIGMS home page will be accessible from the NIH home
         page (http://www.nih.gov/). The NIH home page currently
         offers such information as a database of NIH grants and
         contracts, biomedical information relating to health issues
         and clinical protocols, research opportunities at NIH, links
         to molecular biology and molecular modeling databases, and
         links to other NIH information services.</P>

         <H3>MBRS Investigator Becomes AAAS Fellow</H3>
         
         <P>Dr. George V. Hillyer, a professor of pathology and MBRS
         associate investigator at the University of Puerto Rico
         School of Medicine in San Juan, has been elected a fellow of
         the American Association for the Advancement of Science
         (AAAS). He was elected for his "pioneering work on
         cross-immunity in schistosomiasis and fascioliasis and for
         careful analysis of the antigenic determinants both for
         immunity and immunodiagnosis," according to AAAS. This
         research has been supported by NIH's National Institute of
         Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</P>
         
         <P>Hillyer has been associated with the University of Puerto
         Rico system since 1972. During that time, he has served as a
         professor of immunology and parasitology (1972-1987) and as
         chairman of the department of biology (1981-1987) at the Rio
         Piedras campus. In 1987, Hillyer transferred to the Medical
         Sciences campus. Since joining the staff, he has served as
         director of the Laboratory of Parasite Immunology and
         Pathology. Hillyer also was responsible for writing the
         curriculum for the university's first intercampus Ph.D.
         program in biology, which began in 1981.</P>
         
         <P>Hillyer's association with MBRS began in 1973, when he
         and a colleague wrote the original MBRS grant application
         for the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus. He
         served as the director of the school's MBRS program from its
         inception in 1974 until 1983.</P>
         
         <P>Over the past 20 years, Hillyer has acted as a mentor to
         many MBRS participants who have gone on to pursue biomedical
         research careers. "MBRS is a great program," he says. "It
         has enabled many students to work in actual laboratory
         settings, which is a key factor in the decision to pursue a
         research career."</P>
         
         <P>Hillyer earned a B.S. in biology from the University of
         Puerto Rico and a Ph.D. in microbiology from the University
         of Chicago. He has received numerous awards and honors,
         including election as a fellow of the American Academy of
         Microbiology, the Bailey K. Ashford Medal from the American
         Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and the Henry
         Baldwin Ward Medal from the American Society of
         Parasitologists.</P>
         
         <P>The AAAS council elects those whose "efforts on behalf of
         the advancement of science or its applications are
         scientifically or socially distinguished." Hillyer was
         presented with a certificate and a rosette at the society's
         annual meeting in Atlanta in February 1995.</P>

         <H3>NIGMS Reorganizes, Moves to Natcher Building</H3>
         
         <P>In October 1994, NIGMS underwent a reorganization and a
         move to the new William H. Natcher Building on the main NIH
         campus. The reorganization was designed to enhance the
         Institute's effectiveness and efficiency in supporting basic
         biomedical research and research training, as well as to
         align NIGMS' organizational structure and position titles
         with those of other NIH institutes.</P>
         
         <P>The most significant change was the rearrangement of four
         program branches--Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease,
         Genetics, Biophysics and Physiological Sciences, and
         Pharmacology and Biorelated Chemistry--into three divisions:
         Cell Biology and Biophysics; Genetics and Developmental
         Biology; and Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biological
         Chemistry. Two other Institute components also became
         divisions: the Division of Minority Opportunities in
         Research and the Division of Extramural Activities.</P>
         
         <P>According to Dr. Marvin Cassman, acting director of
         NIGMS, "The reorganization reflects the increasingly
         interdisciplinary nature of the research funded by NIGMS. By
         refining the distribution and balance of scientific areas
         among the divisions, we will improve the Institute's ability
         to promote and support the most innovative basic research of
         the future."</P>
         
         <P>The move to the Natcher Building brought the entire NIGMS
         staff to the NIH campus for the first time in more than 30
         years.</P>
         
         <P>The new address for all NIGMS mail is:</P>

         <H3>New NIH Program Supports Student Loan Repayment</H3>
         
         <P>The Office of the Director, NIH, recently established a
         Loan Repayment Program for Clinical Researchers from
         Disadvantaged Backgrounds (CR-LRP). The goal of the program
         is to encourage physicians from "disadvantaged backgrounds"
         to join the intramural clinical research programs offered at
         the various NIH institutes. In exchange, a sizable portion
         of the physician's accumulated student debt--up to &#36;20,000
         per year--can be repaid. Qualifying debt includes student
         debt that may have been incurred while attending
         undergraduate, graduate, or medical school.</P>
         
         <P>To be eligible for loan repayment benefits, CR-LRP
         recipients must agree to remain employed at NIH for a
         minimum of 2 years. This period usually runs concurrently
         with a postdoctoral fellowship.</P>
         
         <P>Although the program is intended primarily for those with
         an M.D. degree, individuals with a Ph.D., D.O., D.D.S.,
         D.M.D., or A.D.N./B.S.N. may also qualify if they are
         engaged in clinical research.</P>
         
         <P>For this program, clinical research is defined as
         biomedical and behavioral studies of the etiology,
         epidemiology, prevention (and prevention strategies),
         diagnosis, or treatment of diseases, disorders, or
         conditions, including but not limited to clinical trials.
         </P>
         
         <P>"NIH recognizes that many physicians are dissuaded from
         considering clinical research training because of their
         heavy debt burden," explains CR-LRP program director Marc
         Horowitz. "The average NIH salary of &#36;38,000 for first-year
         clinical associates, although attractive, often cannot
         support debt repayment of those physicians with between
         &#36;60,000 and &#36;100,000 in student debt that is often still
         accruing interest," he adds.</P>
         
         <P>For this program, an individual from a disadvantaged
         background is one who comes from an environment that
         inhibited (but did not prevent) the individual from
         obtaining the knowledge, skill, and ability required to
         enroll in and graduate from a health professions school. It
         also applies to an individual who comes from a family with
         an annual income below a level based on low-income
         thresholds according to family size.</P>
         
         <P>An individual may certify disadvantaged status under the
         above definition by either submitting a personal statement
         explaining the applicability of the definition to his or her
         circumstances or by providing certification from his or her
         educational institution that he or she qualified for Federal
         disadvantaged assistance during attendance. Priority in
         funding will be given to qualified health professionals who
         are from disadvantaged backgrounds and who are
         underrepresented in biomedical or behavioral research,
         including members of minority groups, women, and disabled
         researchers.</P>
         
         <P>During fiscal year 1994, the first year of operation,
         five clinicians from disadvantaged backgrounds were selected
         to participate in this program. An additional 10 clinicians
         are expected to be selected in each of the next two fiscal
         years.</P>
         
         <P>For more information about the program, including
         deadline dates for the next fiscal year and an application
         package, contact:</P>

         <H3>NIH Reannounces Program to Promote Reentry into Research
         Careers</H3>
         
         <P>NIH recognizes the need to increase the number of women,
         minorities, and people with disabilities in biomedical and
         behavioral research careers. Among the reasons for the low
         representation of women may be the fact that women bear the
         majority of responsibilities surrounding child and family
         care. To address this issue, NIH is reannouncing the
         Supplements to Promote Reentry into Biomedical and
         Behavioral Research Careers Program. The program is designed
         to offer opportunities to women and men who have interrupted
         their research careers to care for children or parents or to
         attend to other family responsibilities. The objective of
         the program is for those who receive support to reestablish
         careers in biomedical or behavioral research.</P>
         
         <P>To be eligible for a supplement, candidates must have a
         doctoral degree such as an M.D., D.D.S., Ph.D., D.O.,
         D.V.M., or equivalent; at least 2 years of postdoctoral
         research experience; and sufficient prior research
         experience to qualify for a faculty appointment at the
         assistant professor or equivalent level.</P>
         
         <P>Principal investigators with active NIH grants with at
         least 2 years of support remaining are eligible to submit a
         request for an administrative supplement to support an
         individual who is reentering a research career. A maximum of
         3 years of supplemental support can be awarded, and the
         support can be either part-time or full-time.</P>
         
         <P>In 1992 and 1993, the NIH Office of Research on Women's
         Health sponsored a research supplement program to promote
         reentry with a single application date each year. The
         present announcement replaces that program with one with an
         open receipt date and with review and funding done directly
         by participating NIH institutes and centers.</P>

         <H3>Fogarty International Center Offers International
         Research Collaboration Awards</H3>
         
         <P>An important role of the NIH Fogarty International Center
         is to foster discovery through the support of international
         cooperation across the continuum of basic, clinical, and
         applied biomedical, behavioral, and health sciences. The
         opportunity to collaborate internationally provides a means
         of access to new information and perspectives; innovative
         concepts and methods; emerging research technologies; or
         unique populations and environments. To facilitate such
         collaborations, the center recently announced the Fogarty
         International Research Collaboration Award (FIRCA). The
         award is made to a U.S. institution to support a
         collaborative research project that will be carried out
         mainly at a foreign collaborator's research site. The award
         is intended to extend and enhance the research program of a
         U.S. scientist, while at the same time benefitting the
         scientific interests of the collaborating foreign scientist.
         </P>
         
         <P>Up to &#36;20,000 in direct costs per year are available for
         up to 3 years. Funds are available to purchase supplies for
         the foreign collaborator's laboratory and to support travel
         for the U.S. and foreign collaborators and their research
         associates, as justified by the needs of the collaborative
         research. If the foreign collaborator does not have
         significant biomedical research infrastructure support, the
         FIRCA will provide small pieces of equipment necessary to
         the research project.</P>
         
         <P>All biomedical and behavioral research topics supported
         by NIH are eligible for inclusion under this program.
         However, investigators working on topics related to HIV,
         AIDS, or related illnesses should apply for the Fogarty
         International Center's HIV, AIDS, and Related Illnesses
         Collaboration Award.</P>

         participants who have excelled in their fields. We also hope
         that the profiles will give students an idea of the types of

         take to lead them to those careers.</P>
         
         <P>Dr. Reyes, a former MBRS undergraduate participant at the
         University of California, Santa Cruz, is vice president of
         research and development at Ingenex, Inc., in Menlo Park,
         CA. He is involved in pharmaceutical research and drug
         development of anticancer and antiviral agents, with an
         emphasis on using gene therapy as a drug delivery vehicle.
         Prior to taking this position, Reyes worked for other
         biotechnology companies, including Triplex Pharmaceutical
         Corporation in The Woodlands, TX, and Genelabs Incorporated
         in Redwood City, CA. He has published more than 20 papers
         and holds three U.S. patents and several foreign patents.
         Reyes received a B.S. in biology from the University of
         California, Santa Cruz, and an M.D.-Ph.D. from the Johns
         Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD.</P>
         
         <H4>HOW I BECAME INTERESTED IN SCIENCE:</H4>
         
         <P>Several factors that influenced my decision to enter
         basic/medical science included:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>the distinction between the numerous valid
            interpretations of uncontrolled or subjective writings
            versus the objective, fact-based, physical world of
            science;
            
            <LI>the ability to construct, in an experimental sense,
            situations where data could be obtained and then
            objectively evaluated to reach a conclusion to either
            support or refute a scientific hypothesis;
            
            <LI>the ability to contribute to the store of human
            knowledge and in the process alleviate disease
            conditions.
         </UL>
         
         <P>My interest in medicine was based on developing
         applications to biological systems, using discoveries from
         basic science investigations. My "molecular orientation" was
         based on an interest in the gene and its central role as the
         blueprint for all living organisms.</P>
         
         <H4>HOW MBRS HELPED ME:</H4>
         
         <P>MBRS provided me with my first opportunity to explore a
         scientific career and to really understand what it means to
         be a scientist. It provided an apprenticeship of sorts since
         there are very few ways for one to obtain the required
         exposure to a broad field such as science and in the process
         formulate how a career in science might take shape while
         simultaneously developing a sense of accomplishment. My
         scientific accomplishments as an MBRS student participant
         were significant to my eventual matriculation as a combined
         M.D.-Ph.D. student at the [NIGMS-supported] Medical
         Scientist Training Program at the Johns Hopkins University
         School of Medicine.</P>
         
         <H4>THING I ENJOY MOST ABOUT SCIENCE:</H4>
         
         <P>Making discoveries and understanding how these might
         impact the lives of others.</P>
         
         <H4>MY ROLE MODEL:</H4>
         
         <P>My parents were major role models with respect to how I
         should generally conduct myself while emphasizing a value
         system that centered on a recognition that working hard (in
         any area) was rewarded and recognized. I was particularly
         fortunate in that the University of California, Santa Cruz,
         provided numerous faculty researchers as role models,
         including Drs. Victor Rocha, Frank Talamantes, Clif Poodry,
         and Leo Ortiz.</P>
         
         <H4>ADVICE TO STUDENTS ENTERING/CONSIDERING SCIENTIFIC
         CAREERS:</H4>
         
         <P>Keep an open mind to all possible avenues in which your
         career might take you. For example, biotechnology didn't
         exist as a distinct field or industry at the time that I was
         majoring in biology at Santa Cruz. Take a variety of
         upper-division science classes but don't let these
         overshadow a balanced development in liberal arts education;
         you'll have more than enough time to specialize.</P>

         <H4>MBRS Investigator Studies Molecules' Role in Infection
         </H4>
         
         <P>Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
         play a pivotal role in the body's response to viral
         infections, and possibly to cancer. The molecules' role is
         to bind pieces of proteins (peptides) made inside the cell
         and then carry them to the cell surface. At the cell
         surface, the combination of class I MHC molecules and
         peptides can be scrutinized by the immune system. If a
         peptide is a piece of a normal protein, then the immune
         system ignores the cell. However, if a peptide is from a
         viral protein, then the immune system rapidly eliminates
         that cell.</P>
         
         <P>Dr. Martha Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, an MBRS investigator at
         the University of California, Santa Cruz, studies the
         molecular associations necessary for the assembly of class I
         MHC molecules with their peptide cargo, and for the
         transport of the complex to the cell surface. Some of her
         studies are on class I MHC molecules of mouse and human
         cells grown in culture. One molecule that is required for
         class I MHC assembly with peptide is
         &szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin (&szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m).
         This molecule actually forms a trimolecular complex with the
         class I MHC molecule and peptide. Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga
         recently has shown that &szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m's association
         with the class I MHC molecule early in its synthesis is
         important for the proper folding of the outermost region of
         the class I MHC molecule to allow stable association with
         peptide.</P>
         
         <P>While studies on human and mouse cells in culture have
         been fruitful, this system does not permit a genetic
         analysis of class I MHC assembly with peptide and
         &szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m. Consequently, Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga
         and Manuel Osorio, an MBRS graduate student participant in
         her laboratory, have embarked on a project to study the
         assembly process in the genetically amenable organism
         Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). Osorio's Ph.D.
         thesis project is to generate yeast lines that can present
         class I MHC-peptide-&szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m complexes to cells
         of the immune system in culture dishes. To achieve this
         goal, he has introduced the genes encoding a class I MHC
         molecule, &szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m, and a protein that can
         serve as a source of peptide into yeast cells under
         conditions that encourage the yeast to make the protein. He
         has found that the yeast cells make the class I MHC
         molecule, &szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m, and the protein, but that
         they assemble class I MHC-peptide-&szlig;<SUB>2</SUB>-m
         complexes very inefficiently. He is now in the process of
         introducing other genes that he and Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga
         believe may be important in class I MHC assembly. These
         studies will permit the identification of other genes and
         molecules important for regulating the body's recognition of
         virally infected cells.</P>

         <H4>Research on Frog Hearing May Shed Light on Human
         Auditory Systems</H4>
         
         <P>In an effort to understand the workings of the human
         auditory system, scientists have been studying the auditory
         systems of frogs and toads. As a part of this research, the
         scientists are trying to determine if a frog's hearing is
         affected by the volume of its oral cavity.</P>
         
         <P>One of these researchers is Michael Anderson, a Ph.D.
         candidate in biomedical engineering at Rutgers University in
         Piscataway, NJ, and a former MARC undergraduate student at
         Delaware State University in Dover.</P>
         
         <P>The results of his auditory electrophysiology experiments
         on frogs show that a decrease in the volume of the auditory
         system's resonant chamber (oral cavity, eustachian tube, and
         middle ear) leads to a decrease in auditory nerve
         response--and thus in hearing.</P>
         
         <P>The focus of Anderson's future research is to
         characterize, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the
         resonant properties of the auditory nerve fibers, which
         could help improve understanding of the human auditory
         system.</P>
