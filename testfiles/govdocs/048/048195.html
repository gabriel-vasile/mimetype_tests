            Tumor growth depends on a variety of secreted growth and angiogenic factors. Cellular responses to many of
            these factors rely on the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which serve as
            co-receptors for several signaling pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that inhibition of heparan sulfate
            biosynthesis could bock the ability of tumor cells to respond growth and angiogenic stimuli. This
            hypothesis will be tested by altering heparan sulfate synthesis in tumor cells and model organisms. The
            novel molecular target in this proposal is the biosynthetic pathway for heparan sulfate. Blocking or
            reducing the expression of specific genes in the pathway by genetic strategies is needed to validate
            specific enzymatic targets for eventual pharmacologic intervention. Screening technologies are in place to
            identify compounds derived from natural products and synthetic libraries. To achieve the long-term goal of
            developing novel chemotherapeutic agents, we have the following specific aims: 1. Validate the heparan
            sulfate biosynthetic pathway as a target for cancer drug therapy. Previous studies of Chinese hamster ovary
            cells suggest that ablation of heparan sulfate formation prevents tumor formation in athymic mice. To
            extend these studies to more common tumor lines, heparan sulfate biosynthesis will be altered genetically
            using classic mutagenesis, anti-sense methods, new RNA interference procedures, and chimeraplasty (RNA/DNA
            hybrids). These studies will focus on EXT1 and NDST1 since these enzymes are responsible for the
            polymerization of the polysaccharide chain and initiation of all downstream modification reactions. 2.
            Identify new targets in the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway. Although many of the genes that encode
            the biosynthetic enzymes for heparan sulfate assembly have been identified, several critical components
            have not. To characterize the role of these other components and to study their role in tumor formation,
            new mutants of CHO cells will be isolated in the C5 epimerase and EXT2, a subunit of the co- polymerase
            complex. RNAi methods recently developed for Drosophila tissue culture cells will be employed to determine
            the function of D-Ext2, D-epimerase, and developed for Drosophila tissue culture cells will be employed to
            determine the function of D-Ext2, D-epimerase, and D-Ext1 in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. 3. Identify and
            characterize inhibitors of heparan sulfate biosynthesis. A high throughput screening method was been
            developed to identify compounds that inhibit heparan sulfate biosynthesis in cultured cells. To date, over
            60,000 samples have been screened from the Natural Products Branch of the Developmental Therapeutics
            Program of the NCI and active extracts have been identified. Parallel screening of synthetic libraries is
            planned. Assays for screening drug candidates using sensitized genetic backgroups in Drosophila will be
            established and inhibition of PTEN-mediated overgrowth will be measured. The molecular target of active
            compounds will be examined by characterizing intermediates that accumulate in cells or tissues after drug
            treatment. Identification of active components coupled with large scale synthesis would allow us to test if
            the compounds have anti-tumor activity in mice.

            The Bcl-2-related survival proteins confer cellular resistance to a wide range of apoptosis-inducing
            agents. In work can-led out in our labs, a novel small molecular ligand to the Bcl-xL protein has been
            identified, which inhibits the molecular pore function of Bcl-xL and selectively kills Bcl-xL and, at
            higher doses, Bcl neg2-expressing cells. We made the initial observation that Bcl-xL-expressing hepatocyte
            cell lines are more sensitive than isogenic control cells to antimycin A (AA), a known inhibitor of
            mitochondrial electron transport. A 2-methoxy antimycin A analog lacking effects on mitochondrial
            respiration still exhibited selective toxicity for Bcl-xL plus cells and mitochondria. Computational
            molecular docking analysis predicted that antimycin A conforms to a conserved hydrophobic groove on the
            molecular surface of Bcl-xL. We confirmed this interaction by showing competitive binding of AA and its
            2-methoxy derivative with a known hydrophobic groove ligand to recombinant Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins, a BH3
            domain peptide derived from the pro-apoptotic dimerization partner, Bak. Finally, we found that AA inhibits
            the pore-forming activity of Bcl-xL in synthetic Liposomes, demonstrating that this small ligand can
            directly inhibit the function of Bcl-2-related survival proteins. Two aims of this application investigate
            the structural determinants of AA binding to the Bcl-xL hydrophobic pocket and mechanism of pore
            inhibition. Initial screening of human hematopoietic cell lines for cytotoxic effects of antimycin A
            indicates myeloma cell lines, including multi-drug resistant sublines, are sensitive to AA and 2-methoxy
            AA. Several published studies have shown that myeloma cell survival is predominantly dependent on Bcl-xL,
            despite the expression of several related anti-apoptotic proteins. We propose, using pre-clinical models,
            to test whether multiple myeloma is particularly susceptible to Bcl-xL-targeted therapies, and validate
            Bcl-xL as the relevant target of 2-methoxy AA in myeloma cells.

            Elevated levels of tyrosine kinase activity are necessary the growth and dissemination of malignant
            carcinoma cells. Our laboratory recently applied new technologies in monoclonal antibody production and
            identified dramatic changes in the expression and function of the EphA2 tyrosine kinase in malignant
            carcinomas. EphA2 is overexpressed in cancer cells (by 50-500 fold), with the highest levels of EphA2
            consistently found on cells with metastatic potential. We have also shown that EphA2 overexpression confers
            metastatic potential but that the growth and invasiveness of metastatic cells can be reversed by activating
            EphA2 at the cell surface. Based on these results, we hypothesize that EphA2 provides unextraordinary
            opportunity for antibody-based targeting of metastatic carcinoma. To test this, we recently used innovative
            strategies to generate antibodies against epitopes on the extracellular domain of EphA2. Here, we propose
            to develop new assay systems to test EphA2 as a target for monoclonal antibody treatment of metastatic
            cancer cells. Our Specific Aims are: i) to identify EphA2 antibodies that can target tumor cells, ii) to
            test if these antibodies block metastatic cell growth or invasiveness, and iii) to determine the mechanisms
            of antibody action. Upon conclusion of our studies, we will have validated EphA2 as a molecular target for
            cancer treatment and will have generated the reagents and expertise to exploit a critical vulnerability on
            malignant cells.

            In response to the RFA, we have focused on identifying a selective inhibitor of the target enzyme, Golgi
            alpha-mannosidase II. Many lines of evidence of demonstrate that inhibiting this s enzyme target can retard
            tumor progression in vivo. All of the inhibitors of this enzyme, however, have an unacceptable, serious
            side effect that precludes their further study as therapeutic drugs because they are active against another
            alpha-mannosidase located in the lysosome, as well as a-mannosidase II. Inhibition of the lysosomal enzyme
            causes a phenocopy of the deadly lysosomal storage disease, Golgi alpha-mannosidosis. Significant
            differences in the substrate binding specificities of these two mannosidases can now be exploited to
            develop an inhibitor that is selective for Golgi alpha-mannosidase II. The focus of this proposal is to
            develop a selective inhibitor of this enzyme that is active in vivo, thereby validating Golgi
            alpha-mannosidase II as a novel target for a potential anti-tumor therapeutic. Several key scientific
            advances make this proposal timely, and we have assembled a team of investigators at the Complex
            Carbohydrate Research Center, Univ. of Georgia, to take advantage of these advances. First, the human Golgi
            alpha-mannosidase II has been cloned and expressed by a member of our team, in order to be used in
            inhibitor screening experiments. The lysosomal enzyme has been expressed similarly, and recent data on the
            structure of the active sites of the enzymes will aid in inhibitor design. High through-put inhibitor
            assays have been developed to screen thousands of potential inhibitors. A novel class of inhibitor
            compounds, the sulfonium salts, have been developed by a third team member. These compounds, as well as the
            inhibitor mannostatin, will be modified by a directed combinatorial synthetic strategy by a fourth member
            to generate libraries of compounds that will be screened to find identify potent selective inhibitors of
            the Golgi a-mannosidase II in vitro. Lead compounds will be used again in modified combinatorial syntheses
            to refine inhibitory properties. All of these leads will be tested for in vivo inhibition using a
            cell-based rapid screening assay for selected inhibition of N-glycan processing. Compounds that show in
            vivo selective inhibition will then be tested for their abilities to inhibit the Golgi mannosidase in mouse
            tissues when delivered orally or by s.c. osmotic pumps. The experiments described in this proposal,
            therefore, will allow us to isolate lead compounds that selectively inhibit N-linked glycosylation events
            known to promote tumor progression and demonstrate the validity of the Golgi alpha-mannosidase II as a
            prime target for tumor therapeutic development.

            At times the mobilization of cells by chemoattractants, such as the small chemoattractant cytokines known
            as chemokines, can have deleterious consequences such as contributing to tumor growth and bone marrow graft
            rejection. Recent reports have demonstrated that higher levels of chemokine production correlate with
            progression of breast tumors and melanomas. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that in addition to
            inducing leukocyte migration, chemokines induce microvascular endothelial cells to migrate contributing to
            neovascularization. Therefore, by participating in angiogenesis, chemokines may support solid tumor growth
            by effecting the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, there is evidence that select chemokines protect
            lymphoma and melanoma cells from steroid or cytokine-induced cell death. Consequently, chemokines produced
            by tumor cells may act as survival factors thereby protecting the tumor from cytokine-induced cell death.
            Thus, there are two possible mechanisms by which chemokines contribute to tumor biology (1) an autocrine
            growth, survival factor mechanism and a (2) paracrine mechanism of angiogenesis. Based on the above in vivo
            correlative data this study intends to demonstrate that chemokines and their receptors are likely
            anti-tumor targets and will identify drugs with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor cell survival activities.

            Integrins that bind to vitronectin are highly expressed in neovasculature and play an important regulatory
            role in angiogenesis. At least two cytokine-induced pathways lead to angiogenesis in vivo, and evidence
            indicates that these pathways can be distinguished by their dependency on specific av integrins. Our
            objective is to define the molecules involved in alpha v beta3- alpha v beta5-selective angiogenic
            signaling. We hypothesize that (i) different molecules associate with each of these integrins after
            angiogenesis is triggered by a defined cytokine and (ii) the assembly of specific molecules associating
            with the beta3 or the beta5 cytoplasmic domain results in selective signaling. Two independent, yet
            complementary strategies will be used to approach these questions: isolation of antibodies against specific
            elements present in alpha v beta3 and alpha v beta5 focal adhesion preparations and panning of phage
            display peptide libraries on beta3 and beta 5 cytoplasmic domains. These studies will shed light into the

            A major limiting factor in anti-neoplastic therapy is the failure of some tumor types to respond to
            anticancer treatments, and the appearance of resistant cell populations in originally responsive
            malignancies upon relapse. There is a large body of evidence that genetic changes leading to increased
            cap-dependent translation are accompanied by cancer cell chemoresistance and are associated with a poor
            prognosis. We have recently discovered that inhibiting assembly of the cap-dependent translation initiation
            apparatus eIF4F, (a trimolecular complex of eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF4E) in Ras Vl2 transformed cells by
            transfer of the gene encoding translational repressor 4E-BPl (which sequesters eIF4E, the 5? mRNA cap
            binding protein), sensitizes these cells to non-genotoxic and genotoxic cytostatic drugs in vitro, and
            dramatically reduces their tumorigenicity. Most importantly from a therapeutic point of view, we have found
            that disruption of eIF4F assembly specifically activates apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in
            non-transformed cells, identifying eIF4F as a potential novel molecular target for anticancer drug
            discovery . Thus, here we propose to test the hypothesis that phosphoramidate nucleotide derivatives that
            repress cap-dependent translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the 5? rnRNA cap
            and eIF4E will activate apoptosis in a wide spectrum of cancer cells with an upregulated translation
            apparatus; and sensitize them to safe doses of chemotherapeutic agents without harming desirable bystander
            cells. Our Aims include: Aim 1. Synthesize a library of nucleotides predicted to inhibit binding of eIF4E
            to the 5? rnRNA cap; Aim 2. Test candidate compounds in an ordered series of high and medium throughput in
            vitro assay systems; Aim 3. Utilize preclinical models of breast and lung cancer to test the most promising
            compound (based on Aim 2 results) for its ability to collaborate with well-tolerated doses of available
            cancer therapeutics to inhibit xenograft growth in athymic mice. To achieve these aims, we have assembled
            an experienced investigative team committed to anticancer drug discovery.

            Transforming Growth Factor-betas are polypeptides that are constitutively secreted and activated by many
            carcinomas. They contribute to the tumor's ability to invade and metastasize, to induce angiogenesis and to
            escape from immune destruction. By the same token, cancer cells themselves are generally refractory to
            TGFbeta-mediated growth arrest. This particular set of circumstances raises the question whether blocking
            the effects of tumor-derived TGFbeta on normal tissue (stromal cells, microvascular endothelial cells and
            immune cells) might constitute a novel approach to cancer treatment. In the past, several different
            strategies have been employed to counteract the biological effects of TGFbeta in cancer and other diseases.
            These have included the use of TGFbeta neutralizing antibodies, of TGFbeta- binding proteins, such as
            decorin, and of TGFbeta1 antisense RNA oligonucleotides. Animal experiments and small-scale clinical
            studies using each of these approaches have provided proof of concept that inactivation of TGFbeta has the
            predicted anti-tumor effect. However, larger scale testing and further clinical development of any of these
            compounds has been marred by technical difficulties and limited availability. We now propose an alternative
            strategy to blocking TGFbeta action by targeting the key molecule in TGFbeta signaling, i.e. the type I
            TGFbeta receptor (TbetaR-I) serine-threonine kinase. Small molecular selective TbetaR-I antagonists are
            likely to be more effective than the approaches mentioned above, and should not be subject to the same
            limitations in terms of production and bioavailability. Our collaborators at SCIOS, Inc. have identified
            several promising lead compounds that inhibit TbetaR-I kinase activity in cell-free as well as in cellular
            systems in vitro. In addition, we have developed the capability to measure effects of TbetaR-I kinase
            inhibitors in vivo, using a proprietary highly sensitive antibody that selectively detects phosphorylated
            Smad2. We intend to examine the effects of lead compounds against normal cells in vitro using a number of
            different assays for TGFbeta's biological effects. The best TbetaR-I antagonists will then be tested for
            their antitumor activity against transplantable tumors in mice, with particular attention to their effects
            on metastasis, angiogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Finally, optimization of the compounds in terms of
            potency, selectivity and bioavailability will be carried out to derive analogs with a favorable toxicity
            profile that can be developed further for clinical use.

            The hsp90 family of proteins consists of Hsp90 alpha and beta, Grp94 and Trap-1. They are abundant
            chaperone proteins that play roles in protein refolding and processing and the conformational maturation of
            several key signaling proteins, including steroid receptors, Raf kinase and several transmembrane tyrosine
            kinases. Hsp90 is overexpressed in tumors and may play a role in maintaining the transformed phenotype by
            stabilizing signaling proteins and mutated protooncogenes and by mediating tumor cell survival in hypoxic,
            harsh environments. Ansamycin antibiotics and radicicol are natural products that bind to a conserved
            pocket in the hsp90 family proteins. Occupancy of this pocket by drug alters their function and causes the
            degradation of the signaling proteins that require Hsp90. Addition of ansamycins to cancer cells causes
            RB-dependent G1 arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. Cells with defective RB function arrest in
            prometaphase and undergo apoptosis. One ansamycin, 17 - allylaminogeeldanamycin (17- AAG) is currently in
            clinical trial.
            <br />
            The main goal of this research is to identify compounds that bind lead compounds that bind to the hsp90
            pocket and have selective activities that confer novel indecence properties.
            <br />
            A lead compound, a geldanamycin (GM) dimer has been identified with selectivity for HER-family tyrosine
            kinases. We have also begun to synthesize compounds designed to bind to the hsp90-family pocket and to
            develop chemical libraries of molecules that bind to the different hsp90 family members. These molecules
            will be screened for their ability to bind selectively to the chaperones, degrade specific targets, and
            inhibit tumor cells with particular molecular lesions. Our goal is to derive selective compounds and use
            them to determine the biologic effects of inhibiting each of the hsp90 family members and to identify new,
            target-directed drugs with anticancer activity.

            Our long-term goals are to increase the cure rate and decrease chemotherapy-relate toxicity for patients
            with leukemia. In particular, we are interested in patients whose leukemias express an activated FLT3
            receptor, either as a result of mutation or ligand co-expression. 20% of AML patients have mutations of the
            FLT3 receptor. These patients have a particularly poor prognosis with almost no one being cured in either
            the pediatric or adult populations. The mutation of the FLT3 receptor consists of small (18-105 bp)
            internal tandem duplications (ITDs) which are unique for each patient but all map to the juxtamembrane
            region of the receptor. These mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 receptor
            which is required for signaling. This makes the development of novel strategies for these patients
            imperative if we are to effect improvements in their outcome. If FLT3 constitutive activation is
            contributing to leukemogenesis in these patients, one strategy would be to develop small molecule
            inhibitors of the kinase domain of the receptor. We therefore propose two major specific aims in this
            proposal with FLT3 as the novel molecular target for drug discovery. The first id to validate FLT3 as a
            molecular target by developing several animal models that mimic different ways that the FLT3 can become
            constitutively activated. We will also introduce second "hits" that often occur in leukemia to study the
            spectrum of the hematopoietic disease to which an activated FLT3 can contribute. The second aim is to
            develop assays utilizing cell lines and proteins that can be utilized for high-throughout screening of FLT3
            inhibitors. This will enable the discovery of lead compounds that are unable to inhibit FLT3 in a highly
            potent and specific fashion. We believe that this work will lead to the identification of compounds able to
            inhibit FLT3 which will ultimately be used as novel therapeutics against leukemia.

            The development of cancer depends on the accumulation of specific genetic alterations that allow aberrant
            proliferation of the tumor cell. Protection from such aberrant growth is provided by several failsafe
            mechanisms that work by inducing apoptotic cell death in cells undergoing oncogenic changes. Therefore, for
            a tumor cell to survive, it must acquire genetic alterations that perturb the link between abnormal growth
            and cell death. One very common mechanism to develop resistance to apoptosis is the inability to release
            cytochrome c from mitochondria, a key event in the induction of apoptosis by oncogenic changes. The p53
            tumor suppressor protein plays a pivotal role in this pathway, and loss of the ability to induce p53,
            either by mutation of p53 itself or by alterations in the pathways leading to p53 activation, occur in most
            cancers. These alterations will be exploited by designing assays to identify drugs to reactivate the
            apoptotic pathways in tumors scells. Emphasis will be placed on the development of assays to identify
            inhibitors of the ubiquitin ligase activities of MDM2 and E6/E6AP, the principal regulators of p53, for use
            in tumors that retain wild type p53. Screens to identify cytochrome c mimetics will also be developed. Such
            compounds would repair apoptotic defects downstream of p53, and so be effective in tumors expressing mutant
            p53. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are continuously exposed to strong apoptotic stimuli, and survive
            only by virtue of genetic defects that compromise the ability of the cell to respond to these signals.
            Reactivating the apoptotic pathways would, in principal, efficiently and selectively kill cancer cells.
