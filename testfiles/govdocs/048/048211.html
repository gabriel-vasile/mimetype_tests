    <h1>Wigeongrass (<em>Ruppia maritima</em> L.):<br>
      A Literature Review</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><em>Growth and Production</em></h2>
  </center>
  <hr>
  <h3>Rate</h3>
  <p> Wigeongrass in southwest Canada can germinate and produce mature drupelets 
    in about 2 months (Harrison 1982), whereas, in southern France, other annual-behaving 
    plants take as long as 5 months to mature (Van Vierssen et al. 1984). In climates 
    where spring and fall growth peaks occur, plants probably grow faster in the 
    spring (Pulich 1989). I found no information about the rates at which wigeongrass 
    stems, leaves, or rhizomes elongate in nature. 
  <p> 
  <h3>Yield</h3>
  <p> <strong>Vegetation</strong>
  <p> Healthy stands of wigeongrass usually contain about 500-1,500 stems or plants/m^2 
    (McMahan 1969; Corell et al. 1978a,b; Keddy 1987), but densities up to 5,376/m^2 
    occur (Anderson 1966). Plants in fine sediments probably achieve greater densities 
    than those in coarse sediments (Conover and Gough 1966).
  <p> Annual <em>Ruppia</em> taxa may be less productive than perennials because 
    the former usually occur in wetlands subject to high salinities, desiccation, 
    and other stresses (Verhoeven 1980b; Brock 1982b). Conover (1958) and Evans 
    et al. (1986) found that, in a temperate climate, perennial-like wigeongrass 
    had a single peak of aboveground biomass in midsummer. The peak can occur 
    in early fall at shallow sites where plants are temperature-stressed and photoinhibited 
    (Wetzel et al. 1981). Standing crop can peak nearly a month after the period 
    of maximum growth rate (Wetzel 1964). Orth and Moore (1988) found a strong 
    correlation between percent cover and wigeongrass biomass in Chesapeake Bay. 
    Distinct spring and fall growth periods are usual for wigeongrass in the southern 
    United States, and great midsummer reductions in wigeongrass biomass or even 
    complete die-offs are sometimes seen (Joanen and Glasgow 1965; Percival et 
    al. 1970; Swiderek 1982). Flores-Verdugo et al. (1988) found winter and summer 
    biomass peaks for wigeongrass in a tropical Mexican lagoon. They suggested 
    that the scarcity of wigeongrass during the wet season (July to October) probably 
    was the result of nutrient inflows from a river, which led to stimulated phytoplankton 
    growth and increased turbidity. 
  <p> Biomasses of <em>Ruppia</em> taxa from around the world are compared in 
    <a href="table2.htm">Table 2</a>. The highest <em>Ruppia</em> biomass yet 
    recorded (1,748 g/m<sup>2</sup> dry weight) occurred for the perennial <em>R. 
    megacarpa</em> in fine-textured sediments in the shallowest (&lt; 1 m) portions 
    of a brackish (salinity about 20 g/L) southern Australian estuary receiving 
    significant amounts of N and P from agricultural runoff. The highest <em>R. 
    maritima</em> biomass (1,460 g/m^2 dry weight) was from a shallow (0.10-0.50 
    m), warm (32-33 degrees C in June), well-insolated and fertile Rhode Island 
    embayment where salinities ranged from 20 to 22 g/L and bottom sediments were 
    extremely rich in organic matter (36-58% in the upper 5 cm; Nixon and Oviatt 
    1973). <em>Ruppia maritima</em> biomass up to 1,000 g/m^2 dry weight occurred 
    in a shallow Mexican lagoon that also contained large amounts of organic matter 
    in the sediment (Edwards 1978). Verhoeven (1980b) believed that, under ideal 
    circumstances, the largest standing crop possible for European <em>Ruppia</em> 
    taxa was about 400 g/m^2 dry weight, and he suggested that an American taxon 
    may be more vigorous.
  <p> Peak recorded <em>Ruppia</em> biomasses &lt; 400 g/m^2 dry weight are common. 
    The most common factors associated with these low biomasses are excessive 
    turbidity, competition (most likely for light) by other angiosperms or algae, 
    and excessive wave action or water depth. Filamentous algae can inhibit <em>Ruppia</em> 
    production by shading and by entanglement, which causes plants to be more 
    sensitive to wave action (Verhoeven 1980a). 
  <p> Despite the negative effects of shading and entanglement, algal mats may 
    benefit wigeongrass in some circumstances. Richardson (1980) found that partial 
    shading by algal mats reduces epiphyte fouling on wigeongrass. He also noticed 
    that algal mats in dried wetlands hold water which may increase the survival 
    of wigeongrass lying underneath the mats. Other factors that frequently are 
    suspected to cause low <em>Ruppia</em> biomass are high water temperatures, 
    excessive salinity, overly coarse or soft sediments, and &quoteatouts&quot 
    by waterfowl.
  <p> <strong>Propagules</strong>
  <p> McMillan (1985) found a maximum density of 4,110 wigeongrass drupelets per 
    square meter in a Texas lagoon. There is no information on the total number 
    of drupelets produced in a season by a single wigeongrass plant. 
  <p> Wetlands managed for wigeongrass production can produce &gt; 6.6 g/m^2 dry 
    weight of drupelets (Swiderek 1982). In waterfowl exclosures, Prevost et al. 
    (1978) found the dry weight of drupelets in sediments to be nearly twice that 
    annually produced; this suggested that drupelets can persist into succeeding 
    growing seasons.
  <p> 
  <h3>Chemical and Caloric Content</h3>
  <p> Dry matter composes 10-17.47% of the fresh weight of wigeongrass (Lindstrom 
    and Sandstrom 1938; Vicars 1976; Reed 1979). Leaves contain about 15.8% dry 
    matter and the root system about 11.5% (Wetzel et al. 1981). Vicars (1976) 
    gave the oven-dry weight as 71.6-81.9% of dry weight. Ash content varies from 
    15.9 to 42.0% of dry weight (Lindstrom and Sandstrom 1938; Reed 1979), but 
    this measurement depends on how efficiently calcareous encrustations and other 
    matter are removed from the plants. Plants analyzed by Reed (1979) had highest 
    ash content (42% of dry weight) in spring. Kiorboe (1980) considered the ash-free 
    aboveground and belowground dry weights to be 84% and 77%, respectively, of 
    total dry weights. Verhoeven (1980b) used 25% as an average figure to convert 
    dry weight biomass to ash-free biomass. The dry weight of fresh wigeongrass 
    required to displace 1 mL of water averages 0.111 g (C. S. Gidden, 1965, unpublished 
    data).
  <p> Gross energy of wigeongrass is 3.2-3.6 Kcal/g dry weight (Nixon and Oviatt 
    1973; Paulus 1982). Mean annual caloric content of leaves and rhizomes measured 
    by Walsh and Grow (1972) was 4.44 and 4.25 Kcal/g ash-free dry weight, respectively.
  <p> Protein content of wigeongrass varies from 5.2 to 21.9% of dry weight (Christensen 
    1938; Lindstrom and Sandstrom 1938; Paulus 1982; Swiderek 1982). The annual 
    mean protein content of leaves and rhizomes is 23.2% and 20.0% of the ash-free 
    dry weight, respectively (Walsh and Grow 1972). Grontved (1958) calculated 
    that the standing crop of <em>Ruppia</em> in a Danish fjord contained about 
    25 g/m^2 albumen.
  <p> Lipid content in dry matter of South Carolina wigeongrass was 1.5% (Swiderek 
    1982). Attaway et al. (1970) found that lipids compose 2.5% of the dry weight 
    of wigeongrass, nonsaponifiable material 1.0%, and hydrocarbons 0.073%. All 
    these figures are much higher than those found in four seagrasses collected 
    nearby. They postulated that the absence of short-chain hydrocarbons (C15-C22) 
    in <em>Ruppia</em> may chemically distinguish the family Ruppiaceae from the 
    Zannichelliaceae and Hydrocharitaceae and strengthen Hutchinson's (1959) taxonomic 
    treatment of the seagrasses. A later analysis of the sterols in a sample of 
    wigeongrass that contained 2.2% dry weight lipids revealed the species to 
    be peculiar (when compared to four seagrasses) in its relatively high content 
    of campesterol (Attaway et al. 1971). Analyses of Rhode Island wigeongrass 
    by Jeffries (1972) showed that it contains a variety of C16-18 fatty acids. 
    Parker (1964) measured ratios of stable C isotopes in Redfish Bay, Texas, 
    wigeongrass to test their potential usefulness in determining food chain patterns. 
  <p> Annual mean carbohydrate content of wigeongrass leaves and rhizomes is 27.0% 
    and 63.6% of the ash-free dry weight, respectively (Walsh and Grow 1972). 
    The more soluble carbohydrates composed 35.1% of the dry matter in samples 
    analyzed by Swiderek (1982). Cellulose and starch contents are 16.4% and 3.04% 
    of oven-dry weight, respectively (Lindstrom and Sandstrom 1938). Crude fiber 
    content is 16.5-16.9 of dry weight (Paulus 1982; Swiderek 1982).
  <p> Wigeongrass can remove large amounts of N and inorganic P from the water 
    column (Twilley et al. 1981). Thursby (1984a) considered dry leaf tissue content 
    of 2.5-3.0% N and 0.25-0.35% P to indicate the minimum amounts required for 
    optimal wigeongrass growth. Vicars (1976) showed that wigeongrass from shallow 
    sites had lower N (1.77 mg atomic N/g ash-free dry weight) and P (0.19 mg 
    atomic P/g ash-free dry weight) content than plants gathered from deeper sites. 
    McKay (1934) compared the cell liquid of wigeongrass to the highly concentrated 
    MgSO<sub>4</sub> waters where the plants grew and found lower concentrations 
    of magnesium (Mg), sulfate, and sodium (Na) in the plant tissue than in the 
    water. The opposite was true for the major nutrients (N,P, and potassium [K]) 
    as well as for calcium (Ca) and chlorine (Cl). Verhoeven (1979) found that 
    the K and Mg content of <em>R. maritima</em> s.s. did not relate to the environmental 
    concentrations of these elements but that the Ca and Na concentrations did. 
    In addition, he found the concentrations of these elements well within the 
    ranges listed by Hutchinson (1975) for freshwater macrophytes. 
  <p> Nutrient (N, P, K) concentrations in aboveground versus belowground portions 
    of wigeongrass have been compared in several studies (Walsh and Grow 1972; 
    Wetzel et al. 1981; Getsinger et al. 1982; Van Vierssen 1982b; Pulich 1989). 
    With the possible exception of K, these nutrients are generally in greater 
    concentrations in aboveground parts. Pulich (1989) noted that, in fall, P 
    content of roots slightly exceeds that of leaves. His experiments suggested 
    that leaves are the major nutrient sink in wigeongrass and that water-column 
    nutrients are used through the leaves.
  <p> Little information is available for the minor nutrients. Walsh and Grow 
    (1972) found greater Mn concentrations in aboveground than belowground material, 
    in contrast to the results of Van Vierssen (1982b). Negligible differences 
    in aboveground versus belowground concentrations of Na, Ca, Mg, or Fe were 
    noted by Van Vierssen (1982b).
  <p> The elemental composition of wigeongrass is shown in <a href="table3.htm">Table 
    3</a>. Information is also available on concentrations of other elements found 
    in wigeongrass vegetation growing in irrigation drainwater evaporation ponds 
    in California (Schuler 1987; Schroeder et al. 1988). Schuler (1987) also lists 
    selenium (Se) and boron (B) concentrations in wigeongrass drupelets from this 
    area. In sufficient quantities, these two elements are potentially toxic to 
    waterfowl. 
  <p> In summary, available information on the chemical composition of wigeongrass 
    provides few clues about why the plant is such an important waterfowl food. 
    Protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of aboveground parts are slightly 
    higher than in sago pondweed, which is also heavily used by feeding waterfowl, 
    but mostly for its carbohydrate-rich turions (Kantrud 1990). Several other 
    common submersed macrophytes have higher contents of these nutrients in aboveground 
    parts than wigeongrass (Paullin 1973), but they rank much lower as waterfowl 
    food. Perhaps the delicate texture of wigeongrass leaves and stems adds to 
    the plants palatability. Very little is known about the chemical composition 
    of wigeongrass drupelets.
