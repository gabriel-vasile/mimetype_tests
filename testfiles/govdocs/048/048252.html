    1, 2001:</B> Cosmologists speculate that 10<sup>14</sup> years
    from now (a mind-boggling stretch) the stars in our relentlessly
    expanding Universe could run out of fuel and fade from view.
    The night sky, once the TV set of ancient peoples, will become
    dull and boring: a blank tableau with no stars or nebulae. Sounds
    like an astronomer's nightmare!</P>

    <P>Fortunately, the stars themselves won't go out for a very
    long time. But researchers say the night sky is already fading.
    A recent study revealed that perhaps two-thirds of the world's
    population can no longer look upwards at night and see the Milky
    Way -- a hazy swath of stars that on warm summer nights spans
    the sky from horizon to horizon.</P>

    urban areas. Photo credit: Duane Clausen, Menominee, Michigan,
    USA.</FONT></P>

    <P>The Milky Way is dimming, not because the end of the Universe
    is near, but rather as a result of light pollution: the inadvertent
    illumination of the atmosphere from street lights, outdoor advertising,
    homes, schools, airports and other sources. Every night billions
    of bulbs send their energy skyward where microscopic bits of
    matter -- air molecules, airborne dust, and water vapor droplets
    -- reflect much of the wasted light back to Earth.</P>

    </TABLE>&quot;It's hard to imagine that the incandescent electric
    lamp was invented little more than 100 years ago,&quot; says
    George Eslinger, former Director of the Los Angeles City Bureau
    of Street Lighting. &quot;Since then urbanization and poorly
    controlled lighting has created a severe light pollution problem
    in industrialized countries.&quot;</P>

    <P>&quot;If we don't reverse this trend,&quot; he cautions, &quot;the
    entire globe will soon be wrapped in a glowing envelope through
    which none of the magic of the Universe can be seen by the naked
    eye.&quot;</P>

    <P>City dwellers have already lost most of the constellations,
    the planet Saturn, and a host of medium magnitude stars. They
    can forget about observing most meteor showers, too, or faint
    displays of Northern Lights.</P>

    <P>It's a big loss. Young sky watchers grow up to be philosophers,
    scientists, poets, explorers, and school teachers. But kids aren't
    likely to watch -- or be inspired by -- a blank sky.</P>

    <P>Timothy Ferris, author of 10 best-selling books on astronomy
    and the cosmos, and featured scientist in the PBS special &quot;The
    Creation of the Universe&quot; agrees, &quot;The loss of the
    night sky is most troubling for children. Whole generations of
    kids in cities and suburbs are growing up seldom if ever having
    seen the Milky Way and what a sky full of thousands of stars
    might look like.&quot;</P>

    <P>&quot;People often describe to me in glowing terms their experience
    in viewing the night time sky as if they'd seen something extraordinarily
    exotic... something akin to observing Victoria Falls or the south
    pole. And I'm afraid that's the case for many people...that they
    can count on the fingers of one hand the times they've seen a
    good night's sky.&quot;</P>

    <P>That's a shame because most humans seem to have a deep-seated
    interest in astronomy -- a longing to stare at the stars and
    learn about the heavens. It's what professional astronomers call,
    fancifully, our astronomy &quot;gene.&quot;</P>

    <P>Says Ferris: &quot;All human cultures no matter how primitive
    have felt it important to tell stories about the stars and about
    the nature and the origin of the Universe as a whole. So there's
    something about astronomy that is deeply engrained in human culture,
    going as far back as music, dance and poetry.&quot;</P>

    <P>That ancient call from the stars is one reason why modern
    folk visit planetaria. But can such exhibits replace the real
    night sky?</P>

    <P>&quot;No way,&quot; says Marshall Space Flight Center astronomer
    Mitzi Adams. &quot;Even the best planetaria cannot demonstrate
    the true scale of the night sky. I remember when I worked at
    the Fernbank Science Center's planetarium in Atlanta: I was exposed
    to the planetarium's artificial sky many times a day. One week
    the weather in Atlanta was bad and I hadn't seen the 'real' sky
    for a while. Finally one evening the clouds parted and I walked
    outside. I was <I>astounded</I> by the size and beauty of Orion.
    It was the real thing and I could tell the difference.&quot;</P>

    <P>Adams could see Orion from Atlanta because it is one of the
    brightest constellations. But even brilliant Orion will eventually
    fade if poorly-designed lights proliferate. Fortunately, light
    pollution <I>is</I> reversible. In recent years engineers have
    developed more efficient bulbs with &quot;sky friendly&quot;
    fixtures that can preserve dark skies and decrease energy costs.</P>

    <P>&quot;Consider home security lights,&quot; continues George
    Eslinger. &quot;The $19.95 variety often put more light into
    the air than they do on the ground. But by using the proper fixture,
    properly aimed, we can eliminate glare, eliminate shadows against
    buildings where 'bad guys' can avoid detection ... and do it
    all with less energy.&quot;</P>

    <P>Exterior home lighting is a primary source of light pollution
    in some areas, but not all, adds Eslinger. Street lamps, sports
    fields, billboards and parking lots -- even prison lights --
    can be the biggest offenders. &quot;The sources of light pollution
    are as varied as each community or region,&quot; he says.</P>

    <P>That variety makes the job of the International Dark-sky Association
    (IDA) particularly difficult. IDA was formed in 1988 by a group
    of concerned sky watchers who wanted to combat light pollution.
    &quot;Our goal,&quot; says Eslinger, who is a member of IDA's
    board of directors, &quot;is to educate the public regarding
    the indiscriminate use of light and the benefits of choosing
    the right light to do the job.&quot; As awareness grows, they
    hope, communities and individuals will choose sky-friendly, energy-efficient
    lighting -- and light pollution will subside.</P>

    <P>It's a daunting problem: thousands of communities with billions
    of light bulbs, all aglow. Fortunately, the stars are still out
    there shining bright -- patiently waiting for us to turn down
    the lights.</P>
