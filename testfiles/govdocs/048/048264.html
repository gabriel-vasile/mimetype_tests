<h3>About the Artists</h3>

Andreanna Moravec began her music studies on violin with her mother,

Mary Ellen Newsom, at the age of three.  Currently, she is pursuing

a bachelor's degree in viola performance at the American Conservatory

of Music under Charles Pikler, principal violist of the Chicago Symphony

Orchestra.

In October 1997, she began her season with the Civic Orchestra of

Chicago as co-principal viola.  She also made her debut with the Chicago

Symphony Orchestra as a section violist.  In November, she was selected

to perform for Pinchas Zukerman in his Chicago masterclass.

Sean Bennett began his piano studies at age five.  His major teachers

include Jan MacFarland, Mary Veverka, and Carolyn McCracken at the

Sherwood Music School.

Bennett currently studies with Dmitry Paperno under a full scholarship

at DePaul University.

Benett has performed in master classes for Emanuel Ax, Peter Serkin, and

Leon Fleisher.

He has won over 40 competitions and prizes in his 12 years of study and

has been named "Chicagoland's Most Promising Student Pianist" by

the Steinway Society and classical music station WNIB 97.1FM for five

consecutive years.

Bennett has been the recipient of a Model B 7-foot Steinway grand piano

donated by a generous benefactor.
