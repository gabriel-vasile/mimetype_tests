<font size="+1" COLOR="#336699"><b>TSP Now Accepts Transfers, Rollovers</b> </font>
<P>
The Thrift Savings Plan now accepts transfers and rollovers from more types of eligible retirement plans.
  Effective Apr. 1, the TSP accepts transfers and rollovers of eligible section 403(b) annuities (such as the
  TIAA/CREF), 457(b) plans, Simplified Employee Pensions (SEPs), and traditional individual retirement
  accounts (IRAs), in addition to transfers and rollovers already accepted. The Federal Employees' Retirement
  System Act does not allow the TSP to accept after-tax balances (amounts you contributed that had already
  been taxed); therefore, transfers from IRAs (and all other plans) must consist solely of balances that will be
  subject to income tax upon distribution. This means, for example, that a Roth IRA would not qualify for
  transfer or rollover. The Thrift Board has revised the TSP-60, Request for a Transfer Into the TSP, to reflect
  this change in law. Employees who have TSP accounts may obtain a TSP-60 from the TSP web site
  (www.tsp.gov) or from the TSP Service Office (504-255-6000).
