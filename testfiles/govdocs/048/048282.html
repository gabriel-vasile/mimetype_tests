                        <p>For release: Wednesday, December 08, 2004</p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">&#8220;There is always hope,&#8221; said internationally renowned classical pianist Maestro Leon Fleisher during a recent visit to NIH
                              to give thanks&#8212;in performance&#8212;for the innovative treatment he received at NIH and to the NINDS physicians and scientists who
                              helped to reverse his condition.&nbsp;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">One of NIH&#8217;s inspirational stories, Fleisher spoke to the standing-room-only crowd of scientists, patients, staff, and visitors,
                              gathered in the Masur Auditorium in Building 10, about his experiences with a common, but little known, disorder called dystonia&#8212;including
                              his eventual diagnosis, his treatment at NIH, and his recent comeback to two-handed performances.&nbsp; He then played 2 selections&#8212;Chopin's
                              Nocturne in D flat major and &#8220;Sheep May Safely Graze" from Bach's Cantata No. 208&#8212;from his new CD titled <i>Two Hands</i>.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Fleisher began studying the piano at age 4 and gave his first public recital at age 8. He made his debut with the New York
                              Philharmonic in 1944 at the age of 16, and went on to perform solos as well as making regular appearances with orchestras
                              on some of the world&#8217;s most acclaimed concert stages.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Forty years ago, the three-time Grammy nominee lost the use of his right hand to what was then an unexplained ailment.&nbsp; He
                              was only 35 years old at the time, and at the height of his career.&nbsp; For nearly 30 years after those early frightening days,
                              when he first noticed the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> fingers on his right hand involuntarily curling into his palm, he searched for a diagnosis for his condition, and more importantly,
                              for treatment.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">&#8220;It was the beginning of a great odyssey of hopes and disappointments,&#8221; said Fleisher.&nbsp; &#8220;I tried everything from aromatherapy
                              to Zen Buddhism.&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">At the thought that he may never again play piano with two hands, Fleisher fell into what he calls &#8220;a state of despair and
                              depression&#8221; that lasted nearly 2 years.&nbsp; He continued, however, to express his love of music by teaching, conducting, and
                              playing one-handed repertoires. &nbsp; He also continued to search for treatment for his condition.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Dystonia&#8212;the third most common neurological movement disorder, affecting 300,000 people in North America&#8212;is characterized
                              by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The movements, which
                              are sometimes painful, may affect a single muscle; a group of muscles such as those in the hands, arms, legs, or neck; or
                              the entire body.&nbsp;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">&#8220;I am a dystonic and I will forever be a dystonic. &nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a 12-step program,&#8221; said Fleisher.&nbsp; &#8220;They don&#8217;t know what
                              causes dystonia and they don&#8217;t, therefore, have a cure.&nbsp; But they can alleviate the symptoms to such a degree that they helped
                              me to restore my life again.&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">After several misdiagnoses and years of frustration, in 1991 Fleisher was properly diagnosed with focal hand dystonia&#8212;a form
                              of dystonia that afflicts about 10,000 musicians worldwide but can strike anyone who uses his or her hands to perform repetitive
                              tasks.&nbsp; He was then referred to NIH, where he entered a clinical trial led by NINDS scientists Dr. Mark Hallett, Dr. Barbara
                              Karp, and Dr. Zoltan Mari. &nbsp; Finally Fleisher found lasting relief.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">That relief was in the form of botulinum toxin, more popularly known as botox.&nbsp; &nbsp; Botox is injected into the muscle at the
                              neuromuscular junction (where the nerve and muscle meet) and acts as a sort of muscle relaxer, relaxing the tension in the
                              muscle.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">According to Hallett, who serves as the chief of the Medical Neurology Branch, NINDS, when Fleisher first arrived at NIH his
                              hand was quite curled.&nbsp; &#8220;He had difficulty in even washing his hand.&nbsp; So the first goal with botulinum toxin was to see if
                              we could open up the hand enough so he could wash it better,&#8221; said Hallett.&nbsp; &#8220;Then, of course, he began to try playing the
                              piano.&nbsp; Gradually, with time, he began playing more and more and the music got better and better.&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Since receiving treatment, Fleisher has resumed playing the piano with both hands and has been performing with various symphony
                              orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, and the New York Philharmonic. &nbsp; &nbsp;He recently made a solo
                              return to Carnegie Hall, where he played both two-handed and left-handed only works.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Additionally, Fleisher also now serves as a spokesman for &#8220;Freedom to Play,&#8221; an educational program set up by the Dystonia
                              Medical Research Foundation to raise awareness of dystonia. &nbsp; He travels the world attending meetings and medical conferences,
                              and visiting music schools, to educate students, doctors, and musicians about the disorder.</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">&#8220;My reaction when first faced with this disorder&#8212;which is not an uncommon reaction&#8212;was to work harder, which is the worst
                              thing you can do.&nbsp; I warn musicians about this,&#8221; said Fleisher.&nbsp; &#8220;I warn them to treat themselves as athletes of the small
                              muscle.&nbsp; They make extraordinary demands of the small muscles of their hands and fingers.&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">He also encourages students and his fellow musicians to exercise properly and to seek medical advice at the first sign of
                              trouble.&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Fleisher dystonia is still not a very well-known disorder, even among the medical community. &#8220;I deem
                              my activities to be of a certain import,&#8221; he said.</font></p>
