         circumstances surrounding the settlement and development of the Black
        Hills region 
results in an unusual course of events. Although situated in the midst of a &quot;civilized&quot; 
country, it was among the last geographical frontiers on the American continent
 outside of Alaska. This was wild country in those years, but there was the spirit

of growth characteristic of any frontier. This growth, however, expressed itself
 in a most unusual channel. Not only was the region attracting miners and other

commercial interest, but it was also luring tourists, visitors who would partake
 of its beauty and adventure. Few frontiers have ever experienced this trend
toward 
tourism coincident with their growth.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in this fertile 
environment that Wind Cave was &quot;born&quot;. It could not have occurred at 
a more opportune time, for it was destined to become an integral part of the mainstream 
of this unique phase of growth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind Cave became a cosmopolitan 
thing. There were few caves known at that time; even less developed for tours. 
But the few that were represented the ultimate in romance, mystery, beauty and 
adventure. Most famous was Mammoth Cave, KY, and Wind took pride in being able 
to offer substantial competition. No better is this expressed than in the names 
given to places and things in the cave. Everything was named, and little effort 
was spared toward variety and imagination. These names represent visitors from 
all walks of life (e.g. Old Fellows Hall, Tabernacle, Bishop Fowler's Retreat, 
Dante's Inferno, Milton's Study, Chopin's Nocturne) from the four corners of the 
Earth (e.g. Scenes of Wicklow, World's Fairground, New York Elevated Railroad, 
Union College) as well as the realism and humor the difficult places generated 
(Cliff Climber's Delight, Fat Woman's Misery, Ghost of She, Hard Scramble, Bridge 
of Sighs). This is a distinct contrast with the old names in Carlsbad Caverns, 
NM, which with few exceptions are local, based on American Indian mythology.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through lack of use, the location and origin of 
            many of these names have been forgotten. This period produced a variety 
            of literature that reveals a number of reliable clues for identification 
            of these places. <a
name="Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills"><em>Cave Regions of the Ozarks 
            and Black Hills</em></a>, <A href="/cgi-bin/intercept?http://members.socket.net/%7Ejoschaper/luella.html">Luella 
            Agnes Owen</A>, 1898 and <a href="Mazes_and_Marvels_of_Wind_Cave.htm" name="Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave"><em>Mazes 
            and Marvels of Wind Cave</em></a>, Edward C. Horn, 1901 each contain 
            sections on the cave written in guide book form. The present tour 
            routes were used then, and it is possible to start at the entrance 
            and follow each guide step by step through the cave.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although somewhat more vague in terms of locations, 
<em>The </em><a
name="Private Account of A.F. McDonald"><em>Private Account of A.F. McDonald</em></a>, 
is probably the standard work on the subject, at least historically. At present 
it is the only information available on areas not covered by Horn and Owen. A 
number of old photographs have been uncovered, and thanks to the technology of 
stereo photography a number of positive identifications have been made.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
No scholarly research has been expended in this project. The technique involved 
in simply following the guides through the cave. The descriptions are often adequately 
obvious to pinpoint the location. Often no such feature is evident (many changes 
were made during trail construction) and one must rely on the sequence indicated 
by the guide. If a place lies between two known places, or immediately after a 
known place, the location can be inferred. This latter was employed in many cases, 
and although possible unreliable in some instances, is based on the only information 
available. Until more information is discovered, this is where it must remain.

FIREPLACE<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 1-28</font><br> <br> SOURCE 
OF NAME: &quot;We next enter a small chamber of the cabin type where we are shown 
Lincoln's Fireplace. The kindling is placed in position ready for a fire to warm 
the Rail-splitter when he comes in from the forest. The pine knot is placed to 
give proper light for his nocturnal study, pre-paring him for the presidency.&quot; 
(1) An intuitive assumption can be drawn on the general location, for if Passing 
the fireplace, we notice a Prairie Dog and Mound...&quot; (2) A low, arched alcove 
is located on the west side of the trail, on the entrance side of the Prairie 
Dog Mound. At present, it is filled with rock, obviously the result of trail construction.<br>

<br> <a name="PRAIRIE DOG AND MOUND"><strong>PRAIRIE DOG AND MOUND<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 
1-31 (opposite side)</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Passing the fireplace, 
we notice a Prairie Dog and Mound. The little chirper stands ready to dive from 
our view, but moves not an inch, for his petrified state long ago produced locomotor 
ataxia.&quot; (1) The mound is a group of two small mud-drip holes. The dog was 
a rock, which someone evidently had brought from another part of the cave, and 
in the pre-federal period, visitors were continually attempting to take it. A 
woman from Chicago succeeded in making off with it, but returned it when contacted 
by mail. (2) A visitor in 1963 affirmed that it was there in 1925, but the mound 
now lies completely abandoned.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind

CLOUDS<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 1-32</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF 
NAME: &quot;Our attention is next called to a freak of nature not seen except 
in Wind Cave. Burning a ribbon of magnesium the guide directs our attention to 
the phenomenon, and umbrellas are wished for as we behold the unexpected Petrified 
Clouds. It is needless to state that the unexpected may always be expected while 
touring in a region of perpetual surprise.&quot; (1) Irregular solution on ceiling 
is descriptive.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, 
p. 10.<br> <br> <a name="SNOW BALL ROOM"><strong>SNOW BALL ROOM<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 
l-35 or 1-37</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Looking overhead, we notice 
a myriad of Snow Balls, each adhering to the frescoed rock as if lately driven 
to their rest by the recently liberated school boy. This appearance produces a 
chilling sensation, but the normal temperature returns when the deceived visitor 
learns that the nearest snow is not less than two hundred miles away to the northward, 
and that what we see above us and around us are carbonate of lime formations only. 
They appear so much like well-formed snow balls, however, that the very elect 
are deceived.&quot; (1) Calcite and aragonite deposition is descriptive.<br> <br>

MISERY<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 2-12 to 2-14</font><br> <br> 
SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Leaving this medley of letters and cards (Post Office)
we  pass into Roe's Misery. Here an early guide named Roe got stuck and had to
be 
pulled out by means of a rope.&quot; (l) The narrow passageway south out of the
 Post Office shows evidence of much enlargement, and evidently was this notorious

crawlway. It must have been a tight squeeze. Bob McAdam states, that as a boy,
 weighing 108 pounds, he had to lie on his side to get through (2) and from scattered

comments in &quot;The Private Account&quot;, the McDonalds spent a great deal

of time enlarging it.<br> 
<br> Another amusing insight comes from what the guides 
were apparently telling visitors in 1921. &quot;A little farther on is a large 
crevice into which, as the story goes, a man named Roe unfortunately fell. It 
proved necessary to let down a mule by means of a block and tackle, thus to extract 
him from his predicament. Hence the name &quot;Roe&#146;s Misery&quot; was applied 
to this particular place.&quot; (3)<br> <br> <a name="RED HALL"><strong>RED HALL<br> 
</strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 2-17</font><br> <br> OTHER NAMES: Beauty 
Parlor<br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;The next chamber is called Red Hall, the 
prevailing color being red. Here the visitor is shown Liberty Bell, which is cracked 
just like the original at Philadelphia. What formed it? is the usual question. 
No living man knows, but it is supposed to be the work of a geyser spurting up 
from the floor. Not far from Liberty Bell is a Wash Boiler, which especially interests 
the ladies who are so fortunate as to see it.&quot; (1)<br> <br> Owen, quoting 
Elmer McDonald further identifies the place - &quot;Red Hall is the room next 
in order, and has on either side a red bank of sandy micaceous clay&quot; (2)<br>

LOOKOUT<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 3-8</font><br> <br> SOURCE CF 
NAME: &quot;The next point of interest is the Devil's Lookout standing 65 feet 
high. Here in silence are two pigs, one having an ear of corn in his mouth as 
if ready to run for a more congenial spot. A New York lady discovered the two 
pigs, and remarked, &#145;Isn&#146;t it perfectly wonderful that I should be the 
first one to discover the pigs?&#146; The guide replied, &#145;It is easy for 
people who have been in the habit of seeing such animals to find their likeness 
here in the Cave.&#146; He was saved from her wrath by being the only one who 
knew the route.&quot; (1)<br> <br> Up until 1890 this point marked the end of 
the cave. Passageways beyond apparently were too tight to permit passage until 
Alvin McDonald and Bob McAdam enlarged a hole* with a chisel. (2)<br> <br> <font size="1">*:

PALACE<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 3-16</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF 
NAME: &quot;The next room is named Sampson's Palace. It has a very high dome with 
a boxwork edges and stalagmitic floor. In this place is a formation known as the 
Queen of Sheba's Head Dress. The drapery was a premonition of modern Parisian 
styles.&quot; (1)<br> <br> Comments by Elmer McDonald follow much the same idea. 
&quot;Sampson&#146;s palace is the next room in order; here we see some stalagmitic 
water formation on the left wall and the ceiling is one of the most beautiful 
yet seen on the trip.&quot; (2)<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind

pass along to Swiss Scenery (from Sampson&#146;s Palace) a very prettily decorated 
room fifty feet in length by fifteen feet in height. The box work is very pretty, 
shading from yellow to dark brown. The general appearance of the room would suggest 
its name, it being rougher than any other in the immediate vicinity.&quot; (1)

confirmed it. (2)<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of the Ozarks and

</strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 4-1 to 4-2</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: 
&quot;Following our guide, we enter the Queen's Drawing Room, a chamber fearfully 
and wonderfully made. Here tapestries, draperies box-work greet one on all sides.&quot; 
(1)<br> <br> &quot;Passing under an arch (from Swiss Scenery) we enter the Queen&#146;s 
Drawing Room. Here the boxwork has been developed beyond any on our pathway thus 
far. From the ceiling it hangs like draperies and on the left wall is about twenty 
four inches in depth. On the whole this room is elegant enough for the most exacting 
queen.&quot; (2)<br> <br> Consecutive order and the description locate the room.<br>

<br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Advancing a short distance (from the Queen&#146;s Drawing 
Room) we look above and behold the New York Elevated R.R. The cars are not running 
owing to a strike.&quot; (1) Consecutive order seems to locate this, but exactly 
what feature represents this is uncertain. A series of horizontal &#145;tubes&#146; 
parallel the main passage at a level 10 feet above the floor, extending from the 
Queen&#146;s Drawing Room to 4-5. This may have been it.<br> <br> Could be boxwork 
in ceiling which has appearance of tracks above 4-5. Tube is immediately in front 
and down the trail from 4-5.<br> <br> E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave,

Room, and &quot;We step from this room into the ME Church. Rev. Mr. Hancher, president 
of the Black Hills Methodist College, was I believe the first to hold song and 
prayer service in this room; the pulpit is on the left as you pass through. The 
guides always ask if any wish to sing or worship, as any one has a perfect right 
in a dedicated chapel.&quot; (1) Old photograph also confirms location. (2)<br>

to the famed basalt attraction on the coast of Ireland&quot;. (1) Horn indicates 
the same location and describes it as the &quot;most rugged chamber...&quot; (2) 
Leaving the place, &quot;We then make a graceful prolonged bow and file under 
the Arch of Politeness (likely the low duck-under just before 4-11) into Lena&#146;s

4-15 to 4-16<br> OTHER NAMES: Bishop Fowler&#146;s Retreat, Cathedral</font><br> 
<br> SOURCE OF NAME: Proceeding from the Giant&#146;s Causeway, through Lena&#146;s 
Arbor &quot;We enter Capitol Hall at the side, about midway between the ends. 
It is the largest room yet visited being some two hundred feet from end to end, 
with a very high ceiling. Here we notice the wall and ceiling are bare of box 
and other formation and are clean and white. The decorative appearance exceeds 
any room yet visited. After getting into line again we go down a flight of stairs 
to Odd Fellows&#146; Hall ...&quot; (1) This name is apparently the original, 
for it first appears in &quot;The Private Account&quot;. In the company of Mr. 
Horn &quot;We then make a graceful prolonged bow and file under the Arch of Politeness 
into Lena's Arbor, then on into Bishop Fowler's Retreat, where our attention is 
called to the beautiful grotto named Lover's Retreat. Here, a youthful couple, 
having lingered behind and being lost from the party were found by the guide with 
clasped hands and in the meshes of cupid. The midnight darkness of that subterranean 
world has no terrors for Cupid.&quot;<br> <br> &quot;Advancing ... we enter Odd 
Fellow's Hall&quot;. (2) 4-21 to 4-22<br> <br> Bishop Charles Henry Fowler was 
a prominent figure in the Methodist Church. He was Bishop in l884, and at one 
time, President of Northwestern University. In 1898 he founded Nebraska Wesleyan 
University, and likely was instrumental in the establishment of Black Hills College 
in Hot Springs. (3)<br> <br> The same Dr. Hancher who gave the name to the M.E. 
Church room was president of the college at this time. It was probably through 
his efforts that the memory of Bishop Fowler was to be perpetuated in this place.<br> 
<br> The name was later refined to Bishop Fowler&#146;s Cathedral, and later changed 
to Cathedral. (4)<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of the Ozarks and

HALL<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 4-21 to 4-22<br> OTHER NAMES: Model 
Room</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;After getting into line again, we go 
down a flight of stairs to Odd Fellows&#146; Hall, a chamber that on examination 
suggests its name. In the ceiling is situated the &#145;All seeing eye&#146;, 
one of the emblems of that august body, and at little distance the &#145;Three 
Links&#146;; (solution pockets in ceiling) also in the ceiling, and just under 
the latter is situated a rock very much resembling a goat&quot;. (1) This later 
animal apparently suffered annihilation during trail construction, as even with 
the aid of an old photograph, it cannot be located. (2) &quot;On entering the 
hall, the wreck of the Spanish warship Colon attracts attention. This specimen 
of Wind Cave novelty was named by Dr. Lentz of Brookings, S.D. This wreck is 350 
feet below the entrance, nearly two miles from the starting point and in the sixth 
tier of chambers.&quot; (3) The breakdown block between 4-20 &amp; 4-21 is probably 
this feature. An excellent Syringopore coral (could not be located) may be found 
on the ceiling of the dead end passage leading right from the top of the stairs 
&#145;out&#146;, approximately 6 feet from the trail.<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes

</strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 4-23 to 4-26</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: 
&quot;Nature, thousands of years ago, anticipated our choice of colors for the 
national ensign and indelibly frescoed the avenue leading from Odd Fellow&#146;s 
Hall with red, white, and blue. This avenue is called Turtle Pass because it shelters 
a large turtle about five feet in length by three in width. This formation evidently 
was completed weary years before Columbus dreamed of a land to the westward&quot;. 
(1) Likely this was an obstacle to modern concepts of trail construction, as it 
no longer exists. None of the colors are evident, either. However, it would take 
only a thin layer of dust to obliterate them, and dust is abundant.<br> <br> (1)

(Grand Army of the Republic) Hall, Assembly Room</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: 
The original name is descriptive of the breakdown slabs covering the floor, and 
with reference to this room, Bob McAdam states &quot;we christened it the Fallen 
Flats.&quot; (1)<br> <br> Later on, however, &quot;This hall was dedicated (G.A.R.) 
in June, 1899, during the soldiers&#146; reunion at Hot Springs, ninety-six old 
soldiers being present at the dedicatory services. A monument was erected upon 
an eminence within the hall to the memory of the heroic dead who wore the blue, 
but are now sleeping the sleep of the departed patriots. The committee requested 
that every old soldier visiting the Cave leave his name, company, and regimental 
designation at the foot of the monument.<br> <br> &quot;The G.A.R. Hall is well 
named. About it are natural fortifications more durable than were constructed 
upon many a battlefield. Overhead are calcite formations representing breastworks, 
stockades, etc., the handiwork of nature&#146;s creation.&quot; (2) The monument 
occupied the corner of the room now marked by 5-5. (3)<br> <br>

evident in exactly what objects are referred to, but the location between the 
Crossroads and present Assembly Room is positive. Elmer McDonald states &quot;The 
next open country is protected from public trespass by the Garden Wall, which

their craft, and extends at a uniform height to the Fallen Flats&#133;&quot; (1) 
A wall-like configuration extends from 5-15 to 5-13, on that side of the trail, 
but not to &#145;Fallen Flats&#146;, although trail construction could have destroyed 
this part of it. But Horn, in his guide book notes another feature: &quot;Here 
the visitor is shown the Garden Wall, upon which rests the Giant's Coffin. Strange 
sensations creep over one as he studies his surroundings, fearful lest he be intruding 
upon the subterranean retreat or mausoleum of some giant race. The coffin lid 
can be raised and those sufficiently lion-hearted may look within observing the 
Ghost of a Lost Opportunity.&quot; (2) No such feature apparently graces the wall, 
but a prominent coffin-shaped rock rests at the base of 5-14, on the other side 
of the trail.<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black

in terms of the discovery date. &quot;On the 26th day of November 1890 the route,

              SOURCE OF NAME: The name appears frequently in The Private Account, 
              as the beginning of the Castle Garden Route. The archaic form was 
              apparently dropped rather quickly, as there was no doubt emphasis 
              on refinement and public image, for in 1898, Owen describes the 
              place as &quot;a large and high room, beautifully decorated with 
              boxwork and popcorn. The ceiling and the left wall from floor to 
              ceiling are fine box work. On the right you see a dark space, as 
              a very large portion of this room is unused, but we pass the Piper&#146;s 
              Pig. (*) List! The guide is pounding on the Salvation Army Drum, 
              a large projecting rock that on being struck with the closed hand 
              gives a sound very much like a bass drum.&quot; (1)<br>
               <br> A faunal change took place 
by the time Horn visited the cave, for &quot;From the Masonic Temple we pass to 
the Elk's Resort, where an elk&#146;s head greets the pilgrim. Close by is Salvation 
Army Drum made in nature&#146;s shop, and just overhead is a square of Irish Point 
Lace formed by boxwork twenty feet on each side.&quot; (2) The communal identity 
of the drum establishes the identity of both references, although the feature 
has not actually been located. The boxwork and elk head are obvious. Lamp 12-1 
shines toward a feature known as the Blarney Stone. (3)<br> <br> (*) Could this

beautiful room settled between two crevices and lined with box work. Viewing the 
ceiling from the fissure on the right it is seen to be smooth and fringed with 
popcorn. In some places the boxes are closed, resembling finished honeycomb. Over 
head box work can be seen as high as the light penetrates. On the whole I think 
this is the finest crevice in the explored cave.&quot; (1) Later on, however, 
the name was changed, for in 1901, Horn writes that &quot;A passageway to McKinley 
Memorial Hall has the Wind Cave Chimes.&quot; (2) The chimes were probably the 
boxwork. Could this be what Alvin called the Chamber of Bells? It was on this

of which we enter Monte Cristo&#146;s Palace, by going down a flight of stairs. 
This room has the greatest depth beneath the surface of any of the Fair Ground&#146;s 
Route, which is four hundred and fifty feet. In this room is noticed a decided 
change in the box work which is much heavier than any seen, or that will be seen 
on this route, and the color is light blue.&quot; (1) &quot;This avenue (Whitney 
Avenue) leads to Monte Cristo Place, which is in the seventh tier of chambers 
and on the 450 foot level, and 750 feet below the surface, for here the survey 
shows that a towering hill stands above, holding Monte Cristo Palace firmly in 
its palace as if in a Zeus-made vice. Here beautiful clusters of dazzling silica 
crystals appear, flashing under the power of magnesium light like the most brilliant 
of diamonds. In this place a triphammer blow is dealt to geology, which asserts 
that quartz and calcite formations never appear on the same level. Here the unexpected 
appears with quartz and calcite formations side by side as if they were breaking 
no law.&quot; (2) The location is evident, but most of the vugs mentioned are 
apparently gone. While silica and calcite &quot;side by side&quot; are common 
in the cave, the writer was unable to fine any trace of silicious rocks in the 
area.<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills,

the hole protected by a railing between the Three-way Stair and the Second Crossroads.

the whole company to celebrate his discovery of the artist&#146;s noble skill.&quot;

              SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;The next point of interest is Johnstone's 
              Camp Ground, it being the room in which Paul Alexander Johnstone, 
              the famed mind-reader and his party slept the third night while 
              on a hunt for a pin head hid in the Cave by Judge Boomer and W.U. 
              Germond of Hot Springs. Mr. Johnstone made a wager of $1,000 that 
              he could find a pin head if hid anywhere in Wind Cave, and he would 
              make the trip from Hot Springs to the Cave and to the pin head blindfolded. 
              The wager was accepted. The two responsible men mentioned were to 
              hide the pin. It was done. When the men returned to Hot Springs, 
              Johnstone grasped each man by the arm, led them to a conveyance 
              in waiting, drove to Wind Cave in forty-two minutes, entered the 
              cave and after seventy three hours and twenty minutes returned with 
              the identical pin head.<br>
               <br> Less time would have been consumed in finding the pin head 
had those who hid it not forgotten the route they took in hiding it. All were 
lost at times. When lost the mind reader is said to have writhed upon the floor 
like a molested serpent. He cried and moaned as if in the grates mental agony, 
saying his reputation was at stake in the matter, not caring for the money. Thoroughly 
blindfolded, Mr. Johnstone finally led the party into the room known as Standing 
Rock Chamber and placed the point of his knife upon the pin head. A light was 
flashed and a negative taken of the scene just as the point of the knife blade 
reached the pin head. Mr. Johnstone performed other almost equally extraordinary 
feats of mind reading at other places, which provided data for a chapter in the 
New Psychology.&quot; (1) The remarkable thing about this episode is the manner 
in which the different reports agree. &quot;Passing under the (Sheep&#146;s) arch 
we enter Johnstone&#146;s Camp Ground, so named because Paul Alexander Johnstone 
camped in this room while accomplishing the third of his greatest mind reading 
feats, during which he remained in the cave seventy-two hours. He was locked in 
his room at the Evans hotel while a committee secreted the head of a gold pin 
in the cave.<br> <br> On their return, after being blindfolded, he led them to 
the livery stable, and securing a team drove to the cave and found the pin in 
the Standing Rock Chamber, beyond the Pearly Gates, and then drove back to the 
city still blindfolded.&quot; (2) (See also Bohi, Seventy-five years and Wind 
Cave, p. 406) Any number of things could have transpired during this three day 
odyssey underground, from the extrasensory to the fraudulent, but nevertheless 
it created no small sensation.<br> <br> The locations are self evident. Near 10-7

NAME: &quot;After moving along some distance&#133;then come into the Tennis Court. 
This room has the net in the ceiling and I suppose the party can furnish the raquet 
(racket). On the right hand side of this room there is tier upon tier of box work; 
looking to the left you shudder at the almost bottomless pit just beside the pathway.&quot; 
(1) This is mentioned in &quot;The Private Account&quot;, so evidently the name 
originated with Alvin McDonald.<br> <br> (1) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of 
the Ozarks and Black Hills, 1898<br> <br> <a name="TICKET OFFICE"><strong>TICKET

OF NAME: &quot;From the Bachelor&#146;s Parlor the way leads through the Ticket 
Office into the Fair Grounds.&quot; (1) From the Waiting Room (same place different 
name) &quot;A steep pathway and one flight of stairs now brings us to the Ticket 
Office, and another short stairway leads into the room above, which is the Fair 
Grounds.&quot; (2) The progression indicated by the descriptions and a count of 
flights of stairs probably sets the location.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and 
Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 23.<br> (2) Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions of

</strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: l3-18</font><br> <br>
              SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;&#133;we reach the Tabernacle, the 1argest 
              chamber on the Pearly Gates Route. At the end of the Tabernacle 
              is&#133;The Pearly Gates.&quot; (1) Examination of the area makes 
              this identification self-explanatory.<br>

ROCK CHAMBER<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 13-30</font><br> <br> SOURCE 
OF NAME: &quot;Next beyond is the chamber containing the Standing Rock behind 
which Mr. Johnstone made his famous discovery of the concealed pin-head. It is 
an immense great fallen rock on whose dark surface are scattered transparent flake 
like crystals of stain spar, resembling the congealed drops of a summer shower. 
The mind reader entered the chamber by way we shall leave it.&quot; (l) This may 
not be the place. However, the location does have a large breakdown boulder encrusted 
with &#145;Non-euhedral&#146; crystalline gypsum, very common in the cave. The 
progression is rather logical, too. There are also a number of solutional forms 
that could be what Horn describes as &quot;the Eagle, the Polar Bear, and the 
Chimes together with the rock twenty-five feet high, which gives it its name.&quot;

RESORT<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 13-33</font><br> <br> SOURCE 
OF NAME: &quot;A Greyhound stands in the passage way leading to Mermaid's Resort, 
a nook that seems to make one grow young in spite of time&#146;s advance. This 
bower is roofed with crystals, lace like, encrusted with white frosting resembling 
swan&#146;s-down. Imagine a canopy studded with miniature cedar trees, their tops 
downward hanging, spreading, and meeting each other, the roots in the ceiling 
and all snow white, with an orange shade in the background, and you have a slight 
conception of nature&#146;s extravagance at almost the farthest point on the longest 
traveled route in Wind Cave.&quot; (1)<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels 
of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 29.<br> <br> <a name="W.C.T.U. HALL"><strong>W.C.T.U. HALL<br> 
</strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 14-1, 14-4</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: 
&quot;Near the Eastern Star Room is the W.C.T.U. Hall, dedicated in August, 1892. 
Here the flag and white ribbon keep each other company in perpetual night, the 
darkness being broken only by the candle and magnesium light, the sunlight having 
never penetrated that abysmal depth. Fittingly connected with this hall is Silent 
Lake.&quot; (14-39) (1) This close association with the pool fairly reliably establishes 
this place as the present middle elevator landing.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes 
and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 16.<br> <br> <a name="FIVE POINTS"><strong>FIVE 
POINTS<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 14-12 to 14-13<br> OTHER NAMES: 
Eastern Star Room</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Arrived at the top limits 
of the stairs (Cliff Climbers&#146; Delight) the ascent is by no means finished 
but continues through three large chambers known as Five Points&#133;&quot; (1) 
Things were different by the time of Horn&#146;s writing, for from Cliff Climbers&#146; 
Delight &quot;Our path leads to the Eastern Star Room, where chocolate caramels 
tempt the eye and taste. A different route branches off from each of the five 
points of the star.&quot; (2) This latter characteristic probably suggested the 
original name, which, incidentally, appears in &quot;The Private Account.&quot;<br>

INFERNO<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 14-15</font><br> <br> SOURCE 
OF NAME: &quot;The last point on the Garden of Eden Route is Dante's Inferno. 
It is dark, black, deep, and a decidedly weird abode for the tormented, and without 
excuse for its existence when compared with the Garden of Eden.&quot; (1) Following 
Horn&#146;s consecutive sequence, this location is the last room of any significant 
size before returning to the &#145;exit&#146;, Five Points, and Cliff Climbers&#146; 
Delight.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 17.<br> 
<br> <a name="CORK SCREW PATH"><strong>CORK SCREW PATH<br> </strong></a><font size="1">LOCATION: 
11-16 to 14-19</font><br> <br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;Leaving the Garden of Eden, 
but not forgetting it, we visit Beacon Heights (14-l9) and Cork Screw Path. Half 
way down Cork Screw Path the Glacier. (Travertine at 14-l7) Passing the Glacier, 
we reach the Sportsman's Delight, where a Goose hangs suspended from the ceiling. 
(In line between 14-l6 and 14-18) How many years have passed with the Goose unfed, 
uncared for, untouched, no man knows, but she is there nevertheless, ready for 
flight should the Glacier overtake her.&quot; (1)<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes 
and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 17.<br> <br> <a name="GARDEN OF EDEN"><strong>GARDEN 
OF EDEN</strong><br> </a><br> SOURCE OF NAME: &quot;We next pass under the Cathedral 
Dome (Could this be the high dome over 14-33?) through Kelly's Slide (possibly 
the dip formed by the trail and stair at 14-31) to the climax of the route - The 
Garden of Eden. The most beautiful frost-work and box-work fringed with frost-work 
observed on the entire route is seen here in limitless profusion. The candles 
are extinguished and magnesium light is substituted. The tourists from Maine to 
California are fairly bewildered, amazed, and stand speechless as they become 
entranced, intoxicated by the unexpected profusion of elysian beauties. Here adjectives 
are useless, vocabularies fail; the word painter is confronted with a scene which 
defies description. The camera is outwitted; nature triumphs. The many domes are 
doubtless of geyser formation; and the depression named Jacob's Well (pit at 14-29) 
represents the remains of an extinct geyser as he struggled for existence. The 
Garden of Eden covers half an acre; the floor is uneven and rugged; the ceiling 
is a constantly changing panorama of beauty.<br> <br> On one side is the LINNAEUS 
GROTTO, named by Professor Udden in honor of the renowned Swedish botanist; (location 
unknown, but possible corner occupied by 14-2l) for on the other side is another 
grotto containing stalagmites and stalactites in the process of formation. (duck 
under leading from trail at 14-20) A Gypsum Mummy (unknown) and Rhinoceros Jaws 
are also attractions here.&quot; (1) A jaw like formation hangs from the ceiling 
at 14-28.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 16-17<br>

Hall leads to the Cliff Climbers' Delight (15-13 to top at 15-5), sixty feet high, 
via Fat Woman's Misery.&quot; (1) The passageways at the bottom of the present 
Garden of Eden Escape Route show extensive enlargement; likely these were &#145;difficult&#146; 
crawlways.<br> <br> (1) E.C. Horn, Mazes and Marvels of Wind Cave, 1901, p. 15.
