SATELLITE AND RUC ANALYSIS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE DISTRICT UNDER THE              
SOUTHWEST FLOW OF THE WESTERN RIDGE. THE UPPER LOW...NOW CENTERED               
NEAR 38N/142W...CONTINUES TO SPIN OFFSHORE AND IS TRACKING TOWARDS              
SOUTHWEST BRITISH COLUMBIA. TIMING OF THIS UPPER LOW TO PUSH THROUGH            
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IS STILL SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY. AS THE LOW                
CONTINUES TO APPROACH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST...WILL START TO SEE THE             
RIDGE FLATTEN TODAY AS THE FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. HEIGHTS AND 850MB           
TEMP/S SHOW MINIMAL CHANGE TODAY /FROM SUNDAY/ SO WILL STAY WITH                
PERSISTENCE AND KEEP TEMP/S ABOUT THE SAME TO THOSE OF YESTERDAY.               
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING ABOVE 10MB THIS                
MORNING FROM SFO-LAS. THIS IS TRANSLATING INTO CONTINUED LOCALLY                
BREEZY WINDS ACROSS THE DISTRICT OVERNIGHT. SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW             
NO REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADIENTS THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL MAINTAIN           
CURRENT SPEEDS THROUGH OUT THE DAY.                                             
IN THE SHORT RANGE...MODELS SHOW THE UPPER LOW SWINGING THROUGH THE             
PACIFIC NORTHWEST INTO THE UPPER MID-WEST BY LATER WEDNESDAY. WILL              
SEE BEST HEIGHT FALLS ON TUESDAY FOR THE START OF A COOLING TREND.              
IN ADDITION...MODELS SHOW THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE             
PUSHING THROUGH THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE DISTRICT. THE MAIN AFFECT             
WILL BE THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME CLOUDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH SOME            
WEAK AFTERNOON CONVECTION POSSIBLE. AFTER TUESDAY...THE DISTRICT WILL           
REMAIN UNDER A TROF PATTERN THROUGH FRIDAY. ON FRIDAY...HEIGHTS START           
RECOVERING WITH AN AREA OF WEAKNESS REMAINING JUST OFFSHORE. YET...             
WILL STILL SEE TEMP/S RISE...SLOWLY...INTO THE WEEKEND. THE SHORTWAVE           
TROF WILL PUSH THROUGH TOO FAR NORTH TO REALLY INCREASE THE WINDS               
INTO THE ADVISORY OR WARNING CRITERIA LEVELS. THEREFORE...WINDS WILL            
NOT MUCH OF A CONCERN FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE AS SPEEDS WILL ONLY             
REACH THE NORMAL AFTERNOON BREEZY LEVELS.                                       
NO REAL CONCERNS IN THE LATER PERIODS OF THE FORECAST. LONGER RANGE             
MODELS DO SHOW ANOTHER TROF PUSHING INTO THE REGION BY EARLY NEXT               
WEEK. AT THE MOMENT...MODELS SHOW SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THE STRENGTH             
OF THE TROF...BUT ARE IN SOME AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING. WILL DO                  
FURTHER ANALYSIS TO SEE HOW THIS NEXT TROF WILL INFLUENCE THE                   
WEATHER OF NEXT WEEK.

FORECAST PROBLEM THIS MORNING IS CONVECTIVE TRENDS.  AREA OF MAINLY             
SHOWERS OVER WRN FA ATTM MOVG SE AHEAD OF S/WV.  BASED ON WATER                 
VAPOR IMAGERY...S/WV MOVE THRU NW IA AT 14Z SHOULD EXIT FA BY 20Z.              
LATEST RADAR TRENDS SUGGEST CONVECTION IS HOLDING TOGETHER AND WILL             
FORECAST IN THRU THE SE CWA EARLY.                                              
NEXT PROBLEM IS REDEVELOPMENT.  MODELS NOT DO SO GOOD WITH THE                  
DETAILS.  BOTH THE RUC AND THE MESOETA FAILED TO HANDLE THE CURRENT             
CONVECTION SO THEIR SHORT TERM FORECAST TRENDS QUESTIONABLE.                    
MOST LIKELY SCENARIO NOW IS NEXT S/WV...CURRENTLY EXITING MT...TO               
MOVE SE ACRS THE PLAINS.  AMS FORECAST TO DESTABILIZE WEST OF IA                
NEAR SFC WARMFRONT. I THINK THIS AREA IS THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR              
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON.  700-300 SHEAR VECTOR SHOWS A SE                    
MOVEMENT INTO WRN IA THIS EVENING.  INCREASING 850 MB LOW-LVL JET SW

UPDATE FOCUS IS ON THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS               
TWO WEAK VORT CENTERS SWINGING AROUND THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY                   
MOVING INTO QUEBEC. ONE OVER SOUTHEAST LOWER LEADING TO AN AREA OF              
SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS JUST CLEARING OUT OF THE METRO                   
DETROIT AREA. NEXT VORT UPSTREAM MOVING INTO NORTHERN LOWER AND WILL            
BE OF INTEREST FOR THE AFTERNOON/EVENING...WITH A FEW SHOWERS                   
ALREADY APPARENT NORTHWEST OF THE CWA. SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK            
TROUGH CROSSING LOWER MICHIGAN FROM CENTRAL LAKE MICHIGAN TO CENTRAL            
LAKE HURON. OTHER THAN THE MORNING CONVECTION...EARLY VISIBLE                   
SATELLITE SHOWS MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA.             
12Z RUC/ETA DROP THE NORTHERN VORT INTO THE CWA THIS EVENING...WITH             
A WEAK FRONT/WAVE AT THE SURFACE. GENERALLY A WEAK GRADIENT BUT WITH            
BOTH RUC/ETA DEPICTING SOME 925MB CONVERGENCE INTO THE EVENING.                 
INSTABILITY WILL BE A QUESTION FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH -23C COLD POOL            
AT 500MB SHIFTING EAST WITH WARM ADVECTION BEGINNING. HOWEVER                   
850-500MB LAPSE RATES STILL NEAR 7C/KM. DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 50S              
POOLING ALONG THE TROUGH AFTER MORNING RAIN SHOWERS...WITH                      
TEMPERATURES CLIMBING INTO THE LOWER 70S. MODIFIED 12Z DTX SOUNDING             
FOR T/TD OF 72/52 WOULD YIELD 2500J/KG OF CAPE. HOWEVER WITH WARM               
ADVECTION THE GRB SOUNDING WOULD BE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE                  
AFTERNOON AIRMASS...AND YIELDS 1300J/KG CAPE WITH SAME INITIAL T/TD.            
UPPER DIVERGENCE NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE...ALTHOUGH CWA LOCATED NEAR                
GENERAL LEFT-EXIT OF 60KT 300MB JET. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF

FREEZING LEVELS WITH THE WARMING COLUMN IN ADDITION TO MARGINAL WIND            
FIELDS AND INSTABILITY SHOULD PRECLUDE SEVERE WEATHER.                          
WITH LINGERING LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND GENERALLY STEEP LAPSE RATES

TODAY/TONIGHT...LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE ITS' SLOW NWD TREK...             
WHILST THE DLM ATLC RIDGE STRENGTHENS AND EXPANDS NWD. THIS MEANS               
THAT THE SFC FLOW WILL BACK SOME (SOUTH RATHER THAN SW) TODAY WHILE             
AT THE UPPER LEVELS THE GOMEX TROUGH WILL SHEAR NNE RATHER THAN

SLIGHT DRYING INDICATED BY THE AVN ALONG THE SE COAST APPEARS IN

AMPLITUDE TO INCREASE MEAN PWATS BACK UP BY A FEW TENTHS ACROSS THE             
SOUTH...WHERE DRYING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED TO BEGIN WITH. PLAN TO                 
QUALITATIVELY FAVOR THE AVN (THOUGH NOT COMPLETELY) AND NUDGE POPS              
BACK UP TO 50 FOR THU...THOUGH IF IT WERE TO VERIFY 100%...IT WOULD

A SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS LOCATED OVER SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN PER CURRENT              
WATER VAPOR LOOP...WITH THE BEST UPPER SUPPORT WELL EAST OF THE                 
FORECAST AREA. SUBSIDENCE IN THE WAKE OF THIS SHORT WAVE ALONG WITH             
SHARP UPPER RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES IS PROVIDING            
PLENTY OF LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE OVER THE WESTERN/CENTRAL GREAT                 
LAKES. THERE IS A WEAK SURFACE TO 850MB FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER NE                
ILLINOIS AND NRN INDIANA. LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG THIS FEATURE              
HAS BEEN PROVIDING SOME SHOWERS AND SCT THUNDERSTORMS EXTENDING FROM            
SE WISCONSIN TO NE OHIO. MID LEVEL DRYING NOTED ON THE WATER VAPOR              
LOOP MAY BE ENHANCING THE CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL ALONG THIS FRONTAL               
BOUNDARY. BOTH THE RUC AND MESO ETA KEEP THE CONVERGENCE ALONG THIS             
BOUNDARY SOUTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING AND WEAKEN            
IT CONSIDERABLY. THE LATEST RADAR AND SATELLITE TRENDS SUPPORT                  
THIS...THUS I DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN SOME MID LEVEL                  
CLOUDS TO GRAZE THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES THIS MORNING.                             
THE 00Z MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT AND                       
CONSISTENCY IN BRINGING UPPER LEVEL RIDGING ACROSS THE REGION OVER              
THE NEXT 36 HOURS. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN             
LAKES WILL SLOWLY SLIDE EAST OF THE REGION BY MIDWEEK...WITH RETURN

FOR TODAY...500MB TEMPS SLOWLY WARM AS THE UPPER TROUGH HEADS EAST

FORECAST STILL LOOKS WARRANTED. SFC TO 850MB LAPSE RATES REMAIN                 
QUITE STEEP...ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SOME AFTERNOON CU POTENTIAL. LOW                
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED ENOUGH THOUGH TO KEEP A MOSTLY               
SUNNY FORECAST. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON MIXING HEIGHTS ON UPSTREAM                  
SOUNDINGS WERE GENERALLY AROUND 4K FT. BASED ON MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR             
THIS AFTERNOON...MIXING TO THIS LEVEL SHOULD PROVIDE HIGHS IN THE               
MID 70S. A WEAK SURFACE GRADIENT WILL ALLOW LAKE BREEZES TO                     
DEVELOP...KEEPING LOCATIONS NEAR THE GREAT LAKES SEVERAL DEGREES                
COOLER.                                                                         
TONIGHT...THE ETA SHOWS SOME THETA-E ADVECTION FROM 850-700MB. WITH             
THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE RIGHT ON TOP OF LOWER MICHIGAN THOUGH...I DO              
NOT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE THAN FEW-SCT MID LEVEL CLOUDS OVERNIGHT. AN            
INCREASING GRADIENT OVERNIGHT SHOULD PREVENT TEMPS FROM FALLING AS              
LOW AS THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHT. ETA SOUNDINGS ON BUFKIT SHOW A                 
20-25KT WIND MAX DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT AROUND 1K FT. LOOKING AT THE              
MOMENTUM TRANSPORT...THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT TO THE SURFACE SO I                  
EXPECT WINDS WILL REMAIN FAIRLY LIGHT.                                          
WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A SOUTHERLY GRADIENT WILL BE IN PLACE              
ACROSS THE AREA ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE HIGH...WITH HEIGHTS             
AT 500MB ON THE RISE. THIS WILL SPELL A WARMING TREND. GUIDANCE                 
HIGHS OF LOW-MID 80S ON WEDNESDAY AND MID-UPPER 80S ON THURSDAY                 
SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THE 850MB TEMPERATURE PROGS. WITH ALL OF THE             
UPPER SUPPORT STILL WELL WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...I WILL MAINTAIN            
A DRY FCST.

GIVEN THE FAIRLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND WEAK UPPER RIDGING OVER THE

THE SHORT WAVE THAT IS CURRENTLY PUSHING THROUGH WESTERN LAKE ERIE              
EARLY THIS MORNING IS STILL GENERATING A FEW SHOWERS AND SCATTERED              
THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHWEST PA. AS THE SHORT WAVE TRACKS EAST ACROSS           
THE SOUTHERN TIER LATER THIS MORNING IT MAY SET OFF A FEW SHOWERS OR            
THUNDERSTORMS...BUT THE REST OF THE FA SHOULD REMAIN DRY.                       
THE RUC SHOWS ANOTHER IMPULSE APPROACHING WESTERN NEW YORK TOWARD               
LATE AFTERNOON...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST MOISTURE CONVERGENCE WILL           
BE EAST OF OUR FA...SO I WILL NOT MENTION ANY AFTERNOON

THE MAIN WEATHER STORY IS THAT THE STUBBORN LOW THAT BROUGHT                    
OCCASIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR AREA THE PAST THREE DAYS            
WILL FINALLY LOOSE ITS GRIP ON OUR AREA. THE WEAK RIDGE THAT IS                 
BUILDING IN BEHIND THE LOW WILL BRING INCREASING SUNSHINE THE NEXT              
THREE DAYS ALONG WITH A CORRESPONDING MODERATION IN TEMPERATURE THAT            
IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE SEASON.                                                
THE NEXT BEST CHANCE FOR ANY RAIN WILL COME FRIDAY WHEN A WEAK COLD

SOME LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE WEAK BOUNDARY TO THE SOUTH...

ETA BUFKIT SHOWED CAP ERODING AT OFK AND OMA 19Z-21Z.  WARMING MID

WHILE MOISTURE INCREASED FAST ENOUGH WITH WARMING TEMPS TO KEEP LTL             
OR NO CIN AT OFK.  BASED ON THIS ALONE WOULD SUGGEST HIGHER POPS NRN            
ZONES.  HOWEVER...LATEST LAPS SHOWED A MUCH HIGHER CIN AT 19Z THAN              
12Z ETA OR EVEN THE LATEST RUC FCST.  AND LATEST RUC DIDN'T LOWER               
CIN BLO 40 J/KG UNTIL 00Z-03Z TIME PD BUT THEN DVLPD ITS PCPN N OF              
FCST AREA.  WILL STILL RUN THE HIGHEST POPS NRN ZONES BECAUSE OF                
THESE TRENDS...BUT WL NOT GO IN LIKELY CAT OR MENTION SVR UNLESS                
CONVECTION WOULD DVLP BFR ZONE ISSUANCE TIME.  ALTHO IF STORMS DO               
OCCUR IN FCST AREA THIS EVENING...ENOUGH SHEAR EXISTS TO ALLOW FOR              
SVR STORMS.  CAP IS FCST TO RMN AT LNK AND THEN EVEN BUILDS TWD 04Z             
SO WL LEAVE SERN NEBR ZONES DRY.  PREV FCST LOWS LOOK GOOD.                     
WINDY AND WARM/HOT CONDS LOOK LIKELY ON WED.  ETA/NGM 850 MB TEMPS              
WOULD EVEN SUPPORT UPR 90S AT LNK AND EVEN OFK IF FNT WOULD HOLD                
OFF.  AVN RMNS THE COOLER MODEL BUT EVEN IT SUGGESTS LOWER 90S SW.              
ACTUALLY ETA MOS LOOKS REASONABLE AND WL ADJ FCST UPWARD TO THESE               
NUMBERS.  FEEL THERE WILL BE NO CONVECTION AND LTL CLOUDS AT LEAST              
FM MID MORNING THRU MID AFTN SO MIXING DOWN 850 MB WINDS SHOULD POSE            
NO PRBLM.  WL MENTION WINDY MOST ZONES...SPCLY SINCE WINDS HAVE EVEN
