1998-08-06  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update for SCO OpenServer 5 (reported by Jeffery
	Cann).

1998-08-01  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Add Unixware 7 (reported by Phillip Porch).

1998-07-29  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: For rcscmds.c, also include files from the diff
	directory.  Plus of course the usual voluminous "because Visual
	C++ 4.0 feels like it" changes.

Tue Jul 28 22:16:48 1998  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in (dist): unset the GZIP shell variable before calling
 	gzip to avoid invocation problems.

Sun Jul 26 16:22:21 1998  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

	* NEWS: add info about TopLevelAdmin.

1998-07-20  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update entries for HPUX and AIX (based on a submission
	from Andreas Ley).

1998-06-25  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: We generally don't need GNU patch any more.

1998-06-03  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Don't mention the version of Solaris; Mark Borges says
	that it applies to Solaris 2.5 as well as 2.6.

1998-06-02  Assar Westerlund  <assar@sics.se>

	* configure.in: Test for GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE in gssapi.h.
	* acconfig.h: Add undef for HAVE_GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuild.

1998-06-01  Assar Westerlund  <assar@sics.se>
	and Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Check for GSSAPI headers individually.  Use a
	different set of GSSPI libraries if gssapi.h rather than
	gssapi/gssapi.h is found.  Adds Heimdal support.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuild.

1998-05-25  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.spec (%description): Rewrite to be slightly more verbose
	about the basic features.  Don't try to mention what CVS lacks.

1998-05-23  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove items about binary file bugs which were fixed
	approximately 6 months ago.

1998-04-28  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Add note about Solaris sort program (reported by Mark
	D. Baushke).

1998-03-16  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* configure.in: Simplify test for shadow password support since
	the code now handles the case where shadow passwords are supported
	but are not in use.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-03-07  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Remove note about SGI's XFS.  Someone reports that it
	works (I would assume due to the 13 Feb 1998, and earlier, changes
	to sanity.sh).

	* NEWS: Add item about PreservePermissions.  Fix unclear wording
	in gserver item.

1998-03-04  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Add PRESERVE_PERMISSIONS_SUPPORT and
	always define it.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Tue Feb 17 18:32:36 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add memmove back to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS list.
	* configure: Rebuild.

1998-02-16  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO (190): Remove "failed to check out" from commit.c from
	lists of error messages suppressed by -q; it no longer is.

4 Feb 1998  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: The usual "because Visual C++ feels like it"
	changes.  These ones seem to have to do with reordering
	files and release versus debug configurations, mainly.

Fri Jan 30 10:37:40 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update which version of CVS was tested with EMX.

15 Jan 1998  W. L. Estes  <wlestes@hamlet.uncg.edu>
	and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.spec, Makefile.in: Fix some problems with the spec file
	distributed with cvs.  RPM chokes on a build root of slash, so
	that is gone now.  CVS is relocatable (as far as I know) so I
	added a prefix tag.  The source location was incorrect and in
	fixing that I had to add a `g' flag to one of the sed commands in
	the Makefile.in so the spec file gets generated correctly.

13 Jan 1998  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Add lib/fncase.c.  Plus of course the usual
	"because Visual C++ feels like it" changes.

Tue Jan 13 16:49:38 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* acconfig.h (USE_SETMODE_STDOUT): Add undef line.
	(HAVE_SETMODE): Likewise.
	* configure.in: If cygwin32, define USE_SETMODE_STDOUT and
	HAVE_SETMODE.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerate.

	* acconfig.h (UTIME_EXPECTS_WRITABLE): Add undef line.
	* configure.in: If cygwin32, define UTIME_EXPECTS_WRITABLE.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerate.

	* configure.in: Add test for cygwin32, and set LIBOBJS and LIBS
	accordingly.
	* configure: Regenerate.

Sun Jan 11 11:43:55 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Add example of indentation for switch statement.  I
	always have to look this one up, and it seems worthwhile to
	specify it here rather than be unsure which switch statement in
	CVS to use as an example.

Wed Jan  7 09:41:08 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Revise item 149 (concerning changing CVS/Root and such).
	"This whole area is a rather bad pile of individual decisions which
	accumulated over time, some of them probably bad decisions with
	hindsight."

Wed Dec 31 09:25:20 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  Features a change regarding
	removing directories.

Tue Dec 23 08:28:44 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS, INSTALL, HACKING, BUGS, README: Change bug-cvs
	address from prep.ai.mit.edu to gnu.org per email from Martin
	Hamilton.  When referring to bug-reporting procedure refer to
	Cederqvist not README.

Tue Dec 16 13:13:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  The content is the same, but
	instead of being from Mosaic, it is from "lynx -dump -nolist".
 	This output is somewhat better (for example, it is formatted for
	80 columns or so, rather than Mosaic which is rather
	inconsistent), and also lynx is free and still maintained whereas
	NCSA Mosaic is proprietary and no longer maintained.

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  Features an update to the
	Sablime question.

	* NEWS: Add item about GSSAPI.

Fri Dec 12 14:00:57 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add --with-gssapi option, and look for gssapi.h
	and GSSAPI Kerberos v5 libraries.
	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_GSSAPI.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerate.

Thu Dec 11 15:58:06 1997  Eric Mumpower  <nocturne@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Let --with-krb4 override the system Kerberos
	header files and libraries, if any.
	* configure: Regenerate.

Thu Dec  4 20:01:02 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove mempcpy per change to
	src/rcs.c.
	* configure: Regenerated (never was regenerated after getwd change).

1997-12-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add mempcpy.

Thu Dec  4 10:42:32 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

1997-11-29  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: The usual "because Developer Studio feels like
	it" changes.

Sat Nov 29 22:10:32 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove getwd (see lib/ChangeLog
	for rationale).

Mon Nov 24 10:36:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update QNX information per email from Michael Hunter of
	QNX.

Wed Nov 19 17:44:21 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Add Sequent entry per bug-cvs report.

1997-11-17  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about exporting binary files to non-unix
	clients; this is fixed.

Mon Nov 17 09:07:44 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add yet another binary files problem.

1997-11-14  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: updated for diff/ subdir.

Fri Nov 14 12:25:10 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about dying gasps message.  At least one known
	cause has been fixed.

Wed Nov 12 20:24:49 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  Features a wording fix to
	"What do I do first? How do I create a Repository?" and a
	formatting fix (makes it clear which bullets are under what)
	to "What is a module?"

	* NEWS: Add item about RCS library.  Remove item about RCSBIN in
	CVSROOT/config.
	* INSTALL: Simplify instructions to reflect the fact that one need
	not any longer install RCS and GNU diff.
	* PROJECTS: Remove item about RCS library; it is done.

Mon, 10 Nov 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.dsp: For diff/diff.c, also look for include files in
	diff directory.  This means we get diff/system.h not lib/system.h.

Sun Nov  9 16:16:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO (#195): New item, about rsync and such issues.

Thu Nov  6 14:29:14 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO (#194): New item, about separated metadata.

	* TODO (#186): Rewrite paragraph on CVSclusters to be clearer
	about what this can do and why I think it is a cool idea.

Sun Nov  2 19:34:30 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* DEVEL-CVS: Wording fix: want to specify that new developers are
	granted checkin access and the ability to send to devel-cvs, not
	specify whether this is implemented via an "account" (whatever
	that is) (editorial change, not run by devel-cvs).

Fri Oct 31 16:30:57 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention admin -o rev1::rev2.

Wed Oct 29 08:40:05 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Add item 193, about alternatives to timestamps in CVS/Entries.

Tue Oct 28 19:59:48 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO (190): "rcs failed" message is no longer affected by global
	-q option.

1997-10-28  Jim Kingdon

	* .cvsignore: Add Visual C++ files du jour, namely
	{diff,vc50}.{pdb,idb,pch}.

	* cvsnt.dsp: Add files for diff library.  The custom build
	stuff for diff/version.c and diff/diff.c was to deal with
	there also being a src/version.c and src/diff.c.  There
	might be an easier way.

Mon Oct 27 11:21:15 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  Features an edit from Larry
	Jones regarding CVS on Windows.

Mon Oct 20 15:23:17 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about spaces in login names.

	* TODO (#192): Also mention issue with opening connections to new
	servers if CVSROOT changes.

	* TODO (#191): Add thoughts on external difference programs.

1997-10-11  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

	* BUGS: remove note about the `-d' flag bug that was just fixed.

	* TODO: new item 192.

Thu Oct  9 12:59:28 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Revise item #182 to be clearer and to point to the
	unofficial patch.

Thu Sep 25 14:48:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* build.com: Also recurse into diff directory.

Wed Sep 24 10:35:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Don't check for system-supplied regex matcher; see
	comment for rationale.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Sep 23 16:00:25 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about cvs add and -k wrappers.

Mon Sep 22 11:21:11 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Revise item #191 in response to xdelta 1.10 release and a
	few other random thoughts.

Sun Sep 21 17:56:28 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Instead of checking for memchr, just define
	HAVE_MEMCHR and HAVE_STRCHR.
	Add comment about AC_FUNC_VFORK and vfork in general.
	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_MEMCHR and HAVE_STRCHR.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

	* config.h.in: Regenerate using autoheader from autoconf 2.10.

Sat Sep 20 01:17:10 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	[notes: (1) includes the patches to config.h.in which he sent
	(presumably generated), (2) I have omitted a change, which was
	sent without a ChangeLog entry, to change re_exec to
	re_compile_pattern in configure.in, (3) Also adds diff/Makefile in
	AC_OUTPUT -kingdon]

	* Makefile.in (USOURCE_SUBDIRS, check, remotecheck, installcheck):
	Add diff.

	Note that AC_CHECK_FUNCS(vfork)
	has been replaced by AC_FUNC_VFORK... libdiff wants the more
	specific test, and it seems unlikely to break CVS.

	* configure.in: Add AC_FUNC_CLOSEDIR_VOID, AC_FUNC_VFORK,
	AC_STRUCT_ST_BLKSIZE.
	(AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Add limits.h and sys/file.h.
	(AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add memchr.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove vfork.

Fri Sep 19 09:59:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Add item #191, concerning how to store binary files.

Wed Sep 17 16:13:49 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Add ideas about ability to pass spaces in arguments, and
	stdin, to the program under test, as something to consider for the
	different test frameworks.

Tue Sep 16 00:14:55 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about importing binary files.

	* TODO: Adjust item #150 to reflect the fact that the client is
	not quite so mean about tossing the log message as it was.

Fri Sep 12 13:04:31 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update Windows entries per email from Greg Strockbine
	<gstrock@dpc.com>.

	* TODO: New item #190, about meaning of -q and -Q global options.

Wed Sep 10 18:48:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: A few more thoughts on "cvs message" (item 150).

Tue Sep  9 22:20:15 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS (Notes regarding compiling on VAX/VMS): Add item
	about mode_t and pid_t.

Sun Sep  7 17:34:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  The metavariables are back.

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  Features comment from
	julian@whistle about update -r branch:date.  It also clobbered the
	metavariables (confusion about "<" as data vs. HTML tag I would
	guess), which I plan on fixing in a moment.

	* configure.in: Add comment about re_exec and regexp syntax.

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove strdup; CVS was long
	ago converted to use its own routine xstrdup.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat Sep  6 00:08:20 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  In particular: GIC info
	updated, binary files updated (e.g. -kb not -ko), rename database
	and rCVS info updated (refer to TODO), tweaks to section on
	contributing (HACKING, DEVEL-CVS, &c), Cyclic info updated
	(e.g. remove Indiana address), usenet info updated
	(e.g. comp.software.config-mgmt not gnu.*).

Fri Sep  5 20:46:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Add another introductory paragraph which talks about out of
	date material from 1995 FAQ.

	* FAQ: Re-import from FAQ-O-Matic.  This was mainly as a proof of
	concept that I could edit the Cygnus question and have the diffs
	come out looking right (which worked), but I also discovered that
	the previous checkin was truncated partway through.

	* FAQ: Replace file with an introductory paragraph plus a
	downloaded copy of Molli's FAQ-O-Matic.  I believe the content
	closely matches the 1995 Grubbs FAQ but because everything is
	re-ordered it would be painstaking work to verify this.

Thu Sep  4 17:33:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about -w global option and client/server.

Wed Sep  3 23:03:34 1997  Noel Cragg  <noel@harvey.cyclic.com>

Sat Aug 30 03:17:36 1997  Noel Cragg  <noel@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Add a header so emacs chooses the correct editing mode.
  	Made several entries more verbose (expanded some of the less
 	well-known acronyms and/or added pointers to further
 	documentation).

Wed Aug 20 09:51:52 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove "SparcClassing" typo that has been there for
	a while.

Wed Aug 20 09:51:52 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>
			  and Loren James Rittle <rittle@comm.mot.com>

	* INSTALL: Update information for SunOS4, Solaris, Digital Unix,
	and HPUX.

Fri Aug 15 16:42:12 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove the "CVS 1.6" crud; it really isn't needed.  Add
	paragraph about the meaning of the last three arguments to cvs
	import.

Thu Aug 14 14:42:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>
			  and Loren James Rittle <rittle@comm.mot.com>

	* INSTALL: Update information for SunOS4 and Solaris.

Mon Aug  4 00:02:24 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Be specific about wrappers not working client/server.

Sat Aug  2 09:23:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: In step 4, be more generic (the CVS sources are just an
	example, and people might not have them handy).

Fri Jul 25 17:02:30 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Refer to cvs.texinfo as the Cederqvist manual; that
	seems to be the description which best applies no matter how it
	was obtained.  Be a little more explicit about the "$" prompt
	convention and setting environment variables.  Use double quotes
	because they work on both DOS and Unix.

Thu Jul 24 12:22:49 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Also mention SystemAuth.

	* INSTALL (MIPS): Add more detailed report concerning Irix 6.2,

	introduced --bindir.

Fri Jul 18 09:47:12 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item 161 (the comments in cvs.texinfo have a much
	more complete discussion of date format issues).  In item 30,
	change "patch" to "rdiff" and expand discussion slightly.  Remove
	item 64 (the performance issues in initial checkout have probably
	changed quite a bit since that was written and in any event it
	isn't particularly useful without specifics of what is slow and
	ideas for speeding it up).

	* INSTALL: Reorganize to separate out building/installing CVS
	executables from what to do once you have them.  Adjust Visual C++
	instructions to deal with Visual C++ 5.x.  Add brief mentions of
	platforms other than unix and Windows.

Thu Jul 17 21:13:16 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: In item 39, talk about how PRCS 1.2 as a possible model.

Sat Jul 12 15:43:01 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Rewrite paragraph on arbitrary limits to reflect the
	fact that the known arbitrary limits are gone.

8 Jul 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.dsp: Turn on browse information.

Thu Jul  3 10:07:01 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

Wed Jul  2 13:11:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Adjust mention of read-only access in the light of
	changes to cvs.texinfo.

	* TODO: Add item 186, concerning multisite.

Sun, 22 Jun 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.dsp: New file.  This apparently is what Visual C++ 5.0
	uses in lieu of a .mak file (or so it seems).
	* .cvsignore: Add cvsnt.opt cvsnt.dsw cvsnt.plg.  These seem to
	be the generated files du jour for Visual C++ 5.0.

Thu Jun 19 17:16:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add item about CVSROOT/config.

Wed Jun 18 00:00:02 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention pserver --allow-root.

Mon Jun 16 19:07:34 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Add emx.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add emx.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jun  8 23:44:00 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove mkfifo; not used anywhere.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Thu May 29 15:53:06 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* DEVEL-CVS: Add "Policy regarding checkout-only access" to
	replace parenthetical remark about checkout-only access.  This is
	more of a cosmetic/editorial change than a new policy.

Wed May 21 17:02:29 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about wrappers.

Fri May 16 13:43:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about "cvs export" and binary files.

Sun May 11 11:38:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Remove information about "direct TCP".  Noone has
	been complaining about it being broken (the code bitrotted not long
	after it was written), nor has anyone complained
	that contrib/listener.c was omitted from the distribution (because
	it wasn't mentioned in contrib/Makefile.in DISTFILES).  If there
	is a desire to resurrect such a feature, it should use port 2401
	as now discussed in doc/cvsclient.texi.

Thu May  8 12:14:40 1997  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>
	and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update MIPS/SGI Irix 6.2
	* TESTS: Add note about TESTDIR and SGI Irix 6's XFS.

Wed May  7 12:01:21 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Fix keywords accidentally expanded in previous checkin.

	* TODO: Add item #185, concerning keyword expansion and merges.

Sun May  4 19:46:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Replace section on reporting bugs with a reference to
	the bug-reporting section in cvs.texinfo.

Fri May  2 22:50:04 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about importing binary files; the bug is fixed.

Sun Apr 27 19:54:34 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Refer to doc/DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG.

	* INSTALL: Don't mention GREP; CVS no longer uses it.

	* configure.in: Add comment about --bindir.

Thu Apr 24 15:21:17 1997  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@cosa.de>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): added tempnam and mktemp
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

21 Apr 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Visual C++, as usual, wants to fiddle with this.
	This time it would appear to be chiefly the dependencies.

Mon Apr 21 01:06:31 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* NEWS: Document that the client no longer needs an external patch
	program.

Thu Apr 17 14:28:20 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Combine items 150 and 181 since they are basically the same.

Tue Apr 15 12:32:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: The URL of yahoo's Configuration Management category has
	changed.  As it might change again, just cite their top-level page
	rather than the entire URL.

8 Apr 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Add windows-NT/sockerror.c.

Wed Mar 26 15:51:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Further note on import -kb bug.

Tue Mar 25 17:51:32 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Add comment concerning c-label-offset.

Wed Mar 19 14:06:40 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (test for shadow passwords): Use AC_MSG_RESULT
 	rather than echo, so configure obeys --quiet.
	Use yes and no in message rather than yup and nope.

19 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Now Visual C++ wants to add a bunch of dependencies
	for the Release configuration as well as the Debug one.  Why it
	didn't do this before, I have no idea.

13 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Recent changes have added a number of getline.h
	dependencies.

Thu Mar 13 08:43:04 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_C_CROSS): Add comment about obsolescence
	thereof.
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

Thu Mar 13 05:50:29 1997  Philippe De Muyter  <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>

	Here are the fixes I needed to make to cvs-1.9 to get it to
	compile and successfully pass 'make check' on m68k-motorola-sysv.
	* lib/getwd.c (getwd): Added declaration for getcwd().
	* lib/wait.h (WIFSTOPPED et al.): Macro defined if not defined.
	* lib/waitpid.c (waitpid): Use wait, not wait3, if !HAVE_WAIT3.
	* src/admin.c (admin): Added declaration for getgrnam().
	* src/server.c (fcntl.h): Do not include file twice.  Already included
	from system.h from cvs.h.
	* src/sanity.sh (imported-f*): Renamed from imported-file*, that were
	too long for sysv.
	* configure.in (wait3): Added to AC_CHECK_FUNCS list.

Wed Mar 12 14:32:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add "failed assertion `rev == NULL || isdigit (*rev)'" bug.

	* TODO: Remove item 135; this is solved by %v and %V in loginfo.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Don't check for setvbuf;
	HAVE_SETVBUF is no longer used.
	* config.h, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

	* TODO: Add item 184, concerning MD5-based password hash.
	Remove item 14, concerning "pathname stripper".  I think that was
	a reference to the late unlamented strip_path.

Sat Mar  8 21:22:54 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: NT 4.0 is client and local (like other NT 3.51 & Win95).

Fri Mar  7 16:51:13 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Just talked to a NT 4.0 user; add it to the list.

Sun Mar  2 22:01:23 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add item about "cvs admin" vs. "cvs admin .".

	* TODO: Remove item #169.  It doesn't really explain what an
	"archive library" is or in general what the feature they discuss is
	supposed to do--I mean, CVS _can_ be used to store .o's, if
	that is what they are talking about.

	* TODO: Add item #183, about greater documentation/visiblity for
	Entries.Static and CVS/Tag.

	* INSTALL (footnote 5): Add note about how /usr/tmp vs. /var/tmp
	shouldn't be an issue anymore

Thu Feb 20 13:53:19 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update Cray entry per mail from John Bowman
	<bowman@ipp-garching.mpg.de>

	* configure.in: Add comments about autoconf version.

Mon Feb 17 09:55:35 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat Feb 15 15:37:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add windows-NT/SCC/Makefile.

Sun Dec 15 13:12:30 1996  Michael Douglass <mikedoug@texas.net>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention "cvs logout".

1997-02-12  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Visual C++ seems to want to make some cosmetic
	changes (reordering *.obj files), perhaps prodded by "Save
	All".  I hope that putting in these changes will make it
	happy...

1997-02-11  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Replace with version from Visual C++ 4.0.  If someone
	wants the 2.x one back, I suppose we can put them side by side,
	but I won't be able to update the 2.x one any more as I won't be
	having access to 2.x.

Tue Feb 11 16:43:43 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvsnt.mdp and cvsnt.ncb.  They seem to be files
	created by Visual C++ 4.x which were not created by Visual C++ 2.x.

Tue Feb  4 11:42:30 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: OS/2 port is client only.

	* Rename devel-cvs (which had only been in the repository, not the
	distribution) to DEVEL-CVS.  Add "Charter for the devel-cvs
	mailing list:" heading, "CVS Development Policies" title, and
	one-sentence introduction (editorial changes, not run by
	devel-cvs).  Revise paragraph concerning membership in the list to
	reflect policy change to make read-only membership different from
	the ability to send to the list (the new wording was approved by
	devel-cvs, as was the rename and including it in the
	distribution).
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add DEVEL-CVS.
	* HACKING: Add "Mailing lists" section.

Tue Jan 28 10:41:05 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Remove AC_CHECK_SIZEOF; no longer needed with
	lib/md5.c changes.
	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_CONNECT.  This is needed so that autoheader
	2.10 works; I think this has been broken since 2 Dec 1996.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated with autoheader 2.10.
	* configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

	* HACKING: Revise criterion for whether something goes in NEWS
	again (now "user-visible change worth mentioning"--the language
	from the GNU coding standards).

Mon Jan 27 23:05:24 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Criterion for whether something goes in NEWS is not
	whether it is user-visible; it is whether it is a bugfix or a
	feature.

Tue Jan 21 10:21:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Warn people against pre-5.x RCS; describe how to find
	out what version of RCS you have.

Wed Jan  8 14:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, README, TODO, configure.in: Remove CVSid; we
	decided to get rid of these some time ago.

Wed Jan  8 00:17:13 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README (Credits): Refer to NEWS not ChangeLog; the ChangeLog in
	question got renamed a bit but ended up as the bottom of the NEWS
	file.  Eliminate use of first person in a few places where it is
	unclear who it refers to.  Explicitly say that the lists
	of contributors are not comprehensive.

Thu Jan  2 12:59:45 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README, Makefile.in: Remove paragraph about writing to the Free
	Software Foundation at 675 Massachusetts Avenue.  (1) They are no
	longer at that address; (2) the Free Software Foundation are not
	the ones to write to concerning CVS licensing.  bug-cvs would be a
	more appropriate choice; (3) there is probably little need for
	this paragraph anyway.

Thu Jan  2 09:46:37 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

        * NEWS: mention read-only repository access feature.

Wed Jan  1 18:47:08 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.spec: Don't include ChangeLog and ChangeLog.zoo in %doc.
	There is no point in including them without src/ChangeLog,
	src/ChangeLog-96, etc., but more to the point they really belong
	in the source distribution rather than a binary distribution anyway.

Mon Dec 30 16:55:54 1996  Abe Feldman  <feldman@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add entry for changes to checkout command (creating CVS
	directory at top of working directory)

Tue Dec 17 13:13:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add entry for verifymsg.

Tue Dec 10 19:22:20 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Revise comments to explain how to use it and
	general minor tidying of comments.

Mon Dec  2 13:05:44 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Don't call AC_CHECK_FUNCS(connect) a second time,
	because the value will have been cached; instead, check whether
	the library was found with connect defined.
	* configure: Rebuild with autoconf 2.12.

Sat Nov 30 23:04:52 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about mysterious failure in test 187a3.

Fri Nov 29 10:19:50 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Also check for readlink.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated using autoheader 2.10.

Fri Nov 22 16:30:27 1996  Brendan Kehoe  <brendan@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -lsocket, etc., before checking for
	Kerberos libraries.
	* configure: Rebuild.

1996-11-19  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Remove strippath.c.

Sun Nov  3 21:54:18 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Move detailed information on compatibility to
	the manual; simply point to it here.

Thu Oct 31 07:20:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about cvs import of binary files on non-unix.

Tue Oct 29 13:59:14 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about "dying gasps" message.

Sat Oct 26 16:17:09 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for tzset.

Fri Oct 25 10:27:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention new loginfo features.

Thu Oct 24 08:21:48 1996  Lars.Henriksen@netman.dk

	* INSTALL: Update to "DEC Alpha running OSF/1 version 3.2 (1.9)"

Tue Oct 22 10:34:21 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* configure.in: don't check for the existence of the /etc/security
 	directory, because it's possible to have PAM installed without
 	using shadow passwords.
	* configure: regenerated.

Sat Oct 19 18:34:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Say that the remote protocol is not interoperable before
	CVS 1.5.

Sat Oct 19 13:06:53 1996  Mark H. Wilkinson  <mhw@minster.york.ac.uk>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, INSTALL: New options for configure to enable or
	disable client and server code, overriding configure's defaults.
	* confiugre: Regenerated.

Sat Oct 19 13:06:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Add note about what to do if you got a binary
	distribution of CVS.  Add VAX/VMS entry.

Thu Oct 17 15:38:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS, README: Reinstate 30 Sep 96 changes concerning US letter
	vs. A4 paper.

Wed Oct 16 16:59:57 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Simplify code to check for crypt.  Check for
	-lcrypt first, and then check for the crypt function.  The old
	code did slightly funky things with cache variables, which JimK's
	last change disturbed.  Let's just keep it simple.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Wed Oct 16 15:01:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Don't call unset.  It isn't portable to Ultrix,
	but perhaps more to the point, seems like we should be using the
	cached values (there was no comment explaining why we should
	ignore the cached values, and none of the CVS developers were
	able to	provide an explanation when I asked).
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* NEWS: Add item regarding export and "cvs history".

Tue Oct 15 07:40:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Mention the fact that expr is only for the tests, not for
	CVS itself.  At least one person was unclear on this.

Mon Oct 14 12:13:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Add "Submitting patches (strategy)" section and
	sentence about test cases.  These changes have been run by
	devel-cvs and there was no objection.

Sat Oct 12 19:43:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Add notes about some build problems on VAX/VMS.

Thu Oct 10 09:20:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about & in modules file and client/server; the
	bug is fixed.

	* README.VMS: Rewrite sections about wildcard expansion and
	calling editors to suggest technical approaches and to make it
	clear that fixes will only happen if someone gets around to them.
