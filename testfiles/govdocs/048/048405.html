Why GAO Did This Study: 

The EA-6B has conducted airborne electronic attack for all services 
since 1996. In 2002, the Department of Defense (DOD) completed an 
analysis of alternatives for the EA-6B that concluded the inventory 
would be insufficient to meet the DOD’s needs beyond 2009. Since then, 
the services have embarked on separate acquisition efforts to develop 
airborne electronic attack assets. In 2003, the Navy started 
development of the EA-18G aircraft to replace the EA-6B. This report 
was done under the Comptroller General’s authority and assesses if (1) 
DOD’s 2002 conclusion that the EA-6B inventory would be insufficient 
beyond 2009 remains valid for assessing the Navy’s future needs, and 
(2) the acquisition approach used to develop the EA-18G is knowledge-
based and might mitigate future risks. 

What GAO Found: 

EA-6B aircraft will be able to meet the Navy’s suppression of enemy air 
defense needs through at least 2017 and the needs of the Marine Corps 
through 2025-- as long as sufficient numbers of the aircraft are 
outfitted with upgraded electronics suites. The conclusion that the EA-
6B inventory would be insufficient past 2009 was not based on the 
Navy’s requirement for 90 aircraft, but on an inventory requirement of 
108 aircraft that would meet the needs of all services. The decision to 
move to a system of systems using multiple aircraft types means the 
Navy will no longer be required to support all of DOD’s electronic 
attack requirements. However, insufficient quantities of upgraded 
jamming systems means that the majority of the EA-6B fleet is equipped 
with the older jamming system that is limited in its ability to conduct 
numerous critical functions. If the Navy is required to support all 
services, given the recent Air Force proposal to terminate its EB-52 
standoff jammer program, additional EA-6Bs may require the Improved 
Capability (ICAP) III upgrade. 

The risk of cost growth and schedule delays in the EA-18G program is 
increasing because the program is not following a knowledge-based 
approach to acquisition. None of its five critical technologies were 
fully mature as the system development phase began, and that is still 
the case today. Of particular concern is the ALQ-218 receiver, placed 
in the harsh wingtip environment on the EA-18G and not the more benign 
setting of the EA-6B’s tail, for which it was developed. While the EA-
18G’s design appears stable, and almost all its design drawings are 
complete, that may change once the aircraft is flight-tested. 
Production of the EA-18G is also risky: One-third of the total buy will 
be procured as low-rate initial production aircraft based on limited 
demonstrated functionality.

What GAO Recommends: 

GAO recommends that DOD determine how many EA-6Bs with upgraded 
electronic suites are needed to deal with the existing and near-term 
capability gap, and consider procuring them. If DOD does this, it 
should cancel plans to end the electronic suite production line after 
2006. If DOD outfits more EA-6Bs with upgraded electronic suites, it 
should restructure its EA-18G low-rate initial production plans so that 
procurement occurs after the aircraft demonstrates it is fully 
functional. DOD partially concurred with our recommendations.

In conducting military operations, U.S. aircraft are often at great 
risk from enemy air defenses, such as surface-to-air missiles (SAM). 
The services use specialized aircraft to neutralize, destroy, or 
temporarily degrade enemy air defense systems through either electronic 
warfare or physical attack. These aircraft use electronic warfare 
jammers, which disrupt enemy radar and communications to temporarily 
suppress enemy air defenses. Other specialized aircraft use 
antiradiation missiles that home in on radars used by surface-to-air 
missiles or antiaircraft artillery systems to degrade or destroy them. 
Because specialized aircraft protect aircraft of all services in 
hostile airspace, the suppression mission necessarily crosses 
individual service lines. 

Over the past decade, we have issued several reports calling attention 
to the possibility that our nation's ability to counter such defenses 
is being degraded. In 1996, for example, we reported that the 
Department of Defense (DOD) had decided to eliminate the F-4G and EF- 
111 suppression aircraft without first fielding comparable 
replacements.[Footnote 1] Because no replacements were available, the 
Navy's EA-6B aircraft became DOD's only standoff radar jammer aircraft, 
providing suppression support for all services. In January 2001, we 
called attention to the acknowledged gap between the services' 
suppression capabilities and their needs. The gap was a consequence of 
the increasing modernization of enemy air defenses that had outpaced 
DOD's effort to improve its suppression capabilities. At that time, DOD 
stated that the analysis of alternatives (AoA) for airborne electronic 
attack (AEA) would provide a basis for its future strategy and lead to 
a balanced set of acquisition programs for the services. Urgency to 
complete such an analysis of alternatives was motivated by a projected 
shortfall of the EA-6B inventory, primarily caused by attrition, and 
the increasing cost of operating such aging aircraft. The study found 
that the EA-6B aircraft inventory was declining faster than had been 
projected and concluded that it would be insufficient to meet DOD's 
needs beyond 2009. In November 2002 we recommended that a comprehensive 
strategy was needed to remedy the situation. Since then, the military 
services have embarked on separate acquisition efforts to develop a 
future AEA system of systems (SoS) for DOD. In 2003 the Navy started 
development of the EA-18G aircraft to replace the EA-6B as its 
contribution to the DOD AEA SoS. 

We examined the analysis of alternatives and planned acquisition 
efforts to determine (1) whether the key conclusion that the projected 
inventory of EA-6Bs would be insufficient beyond 2009 for all services 
remains valid for projecting the Navy's future needs and (2) whether 
the acquisition management approach to developing the Navy's airborne 
electronic attack core component, the EA-18G, is knowledge-based and 
can help mitigate future risks. We conducted this work under the 
Comptroller General's authority and are addressing the report to you 
because of your committees' jurisdiction on these issues. 

To address these objectives, we reviewed the 2002 analysis of 
alternatives; pertinent DOD, service, and contractor documents 
addressing the status of the EA-6B inventory; plans for maintaining 
them; status of EA-6B suppression capabilities; testing conducted for 
the EA-6B Improved Capability (ICAP) III program; the AEA system of 
systems; gaps in the AEA; and potential solutions for AEA. We 
interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, 
Strategic Command (Offutt, Nebraska); Commander Electronic Attack 
Pacific Fleet (Whidbey Island); and officials responsible for 
requirements and programs for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. We 
interviewed personnel responsible for ICAP III electronic warfare 
testing at the Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation 
(Washington, D.C.); Commander of Operational Test and Evaluation Navy 
(Norfolk, Virginia); and VX-9 personnel responsible for ICAP III 
testing at China Lake, California. We discussed airborne electronic 
attack issues and EA-18G development and production with contractor 
personnel at Boeing Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri and El Segundo, 
California. We discussed software matters with officials at China Lake 
and Point Mugu, California. We met with pilots at Patuxent River Naval 
Air Station; China Lake, California; Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, 
Washington; Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada; and Boeing Corporation to 
discuss pilot workload issues, the nature of the threat, ICAP III 
testing, and tactics developed for AEA. As with our past work on the EA-
18G development effort conducted under our annual assessment of 
selected major defense acquisition programs, we focused our work to 
determining whether the program was following a knowledge-based 
acquisition approach. We met with Navy EA-18G program officials 
currently involved with the development effort to document the maturity 
status of the aircraft's critical technologies, and the status of its 
design effort and plans for producing the aircraft. We performed our 
review from May 2005 through March 2006 in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards. 

Results in Brief: 

The conclusion of the May 2002 AoA report that the EA-6B inventory 
would be insufficient past 2009 was not based on the Navy's requirement 
for 90 aircraft, but on an inventory requirement of 108 aircraft that 
would meet the needs of all services. The subsequent decision to move 
to a system of systems using multiple aircraft types means the Navy 
will no longer be required to support all of DOD's electronic attack 
requirements. As a result, EA-6B aircraft will be able to meet the 
Navy's suppression of enemy air defense needs through at least 2017 and 
the needs of the Marine Corps through 2025--as long as sufficient 
numbers of the aircraft are outfitted with ICAP III electronics suites. 
However, insufficient quantities of upgraded jamming systems means that 
the majority of the EA-6B fleet is equipped with the older ICAP II 
jamming system, which is limited in its ability to conduct numerous 
critical functions. If the Navy is required to support all services, 
given the recent Air Force proposal to terminate its EB-52 standoff 
jammer program, additional EA-6Bs may require the ICAP III upgrade. 

While the EA-18G program is currently on cost and schedule, the risk of 
future cost growth and schedule delays in the program is increasing 
because the development effort is not fully following the knowledge- 
based approach inherent in best practices and DOD's acquisition 
guidance. A knowledge-based approach encourages managers to attain high 
levels of knowledge at key points to support investment decisions, 
ensuring, for example, that technologies are mature before starting 
development and that the design is stable before beginning 
manufacturing. The EA-18G entered system development without 
demonstrating that its five critical technologies had reached full 
maturity, and that is still the case today. Although three technologies 
are now very close to maturity, two have not been demonstrated as they 
will exist on the aircraft. While the EA-18G's design appears stable, 
the potential for costly design changes remains until all its 
technologies are mature. Driven by the expected decline in the EA-6B 
inventory, the program plans to make a decision to enter low-rate 
initial production in April 2007 to meet a required 2009 initial 
operational capability. DOD acknowledges that the EA-18G development 
schedule is aggressive. By adhering to this target, whose premise is no 
longer valid given the Navy's projected needs; the development schedule 
is unnecessarily compressed. Further, one-third of the aircraft will be 
purchased during low-rate initial production based on limited 
demonstrated functionality. This could result in the need to retrofit 
already produced EA-18G aircraft, a possibility that the Navy is 
already anticipating. Software mature enough to test whether the 
aircraft is fully functional will not be available until after the 
production decision. A fully functioning EA-18G aircraft, one that 
meets or exceeds the upgraded EA-6B ICAP III capability, will not 
complete operational testing until January 2009-3 months before the 
projected full-rate production decision. 

This report recommends that the Secretary of Defense consider the 
option of procuring the necessary number of EA-6Bs equipped with ICAP 
III to deal with the existing and near-term capability gap. It also 
recommends that if DOD follows this course, the Secretary direct 
extension of ICAP III production for the EA-6B. It further recommends 
that if DOD acquires additional ICAP III capability, it restructure the 
EA-18G procurement so that it demonstrates the aircraft is fully 
functional before committing to a large low-rate initial production 
plan. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred 
with our recommendations. DOD agreed that refinement of Navy Electronic 
Attack inventory is needed, but believes that it was premature to make 
a decision on ICAP III production until ICAP III inventory requirements 
are determined. Determination of this and other AEA issues are expected 
on September 15, 2006 after completion of an AEA study directed by the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense. 

Background: 

The four-seat EA-6B Prowler aircraft conducts missions for all 
services. The AEA mission is focused on protecting U.S. aircraft and 
ground forces by disabling enemy electronic capabilities. The EA-6B 
performs this mission with a complement of electronic receivers and 
jammers, referred to as its electronic suite, which are located on the 
aircraft structure and in external pods attached to its wings. A 
development effort is currently under way to replace the EA-6B with a 
two-seater electronic attack variant of the F/A-18F, designated the EA- 
18G Growler. 

The EA-6B joined the Navy's fleet in January 1971. The EA-6Bs's initial 
deployment was in 1972 over the skies of Southeast Asia. Since the 
early 1990s, use of the EA-6B has steadily increased. In 1991 the 
aircraft was used in Operation Desert Storm and in support of Iraqi "no-
fly" zones instituted after that war. In 1995, the EA-6B was selected 
to become the sole tactical radar support jammer for all services after 
the Air Force decided to retire its fleet of EF-111 aircraft. This 
decision resulted in increased use of the EA-6B. Since 1995 the Prowler 
force has provided AEA capability during numerous joint and allied 
operations against both traditional and nontraditional threats. It was 
used to provide support for Operation Allied Force in Kosovo and for 
peacekeeping operations over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia, and is 
currently being used against traditional and nontraditional target sets 
in support of ground forces. These capabilities continue to be 
demonstrated in the Global War on Terrorism, in which EA-6B operations 
in Afghanistan and Iraq protect coalition forces and disrupt critical 
communications links. 

There have been several upgrades to the EA-6B's electronic suite since 
it was initially fielded to address increased threats faced by U.S. 
forces. The standard version, fielded in 1971, was quickly replaced in 
1973 with the expanded capability EA-6B, which augmented the electronic 
countermeasure coverage of the aircraft. In 1977, the Improved 
Capability version entered service, and was followed by a more 
sophisticated ICAP II version, first deployed in 1984. The EA-6B/ICAP 
II featured updated receivers, displays, and software to cover a wider 
range of known surveillance and surface-to-air missile radars. As a 
result of heavy use and the limited inventory of the EA-6B, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff directed that the inventory of EA-6Bs be managed as low-
density/high-demand (LD/HD) assets. Low-density/high demand assets are 
force elements consisting of major platforms, weapon systems, or 
personnel that possess unique mission capabilities and are in continual 
high demand to support worldwide joint military operations. In 1998 an 
ICAP III upgrade was initiated to address capability gaps against 
threats from mobile surface-to-air missile systems. In addition, 
concerns surfaced about an anticipated decline in the EA-6B inventory 
because of structural fatigue issues. As a result, an AEA analysis-of- 
alternative was started in 1999 to find a replacement for the EA-6B. At 
that time it was anticipated that the EA-6B would remain in the 
inventory until at least 2015. 

Plans, as recently as December 2001, were to upgrade all 123 EA-6B 
aircraft in the inventory to the ICAP III configuration. The ICAP III 
provides rapid emitter detection, identification, geolocation, 
selective reactive jamming, and full azimuth coverage. Also, ICAP III- 
equipped EA-6Bs will have the ability to integrate multiple EA-6Bs to 
match any threat density, and to control other manned or unmanned 
assets. The upgrade is needed to address capability gaps in the ICAP II 
electronic suite presently installed in EA-6B aircraft. The EA-6B ICAP 
III production line is currently scheduled to shut down after the 
fiscal year 2006 buy.

The AoA report, published in 2002, concluded that an EA-6B replacement 
would be needed in 2009 to meet the services needs. The AoA further 
concluded that two components are needed to provide a complete AEA 
solution that is able to meet DOD's collective needs. These two 
components are a recoverable "core" component and an expendable "stand- 
in" component. 

The AEA AoA report identified 27 platform combinations that were 
capable of delivering jamming support. The study concluded that the 
final AEA solution must address both anticipated short-term platform 
shortfalls, as well as how best to implement the follow-on capability 
based on the menu of alternatives developed by the AoA. In addition, 
the study concluded that before a service can begin a formal 
acquisition program, the discussion should consider, among other 
things, whether one service will provide all DOD core component 
capability, and whether the AEA core component will reside on a single 
platform. 

Subsequent to the AoA report, the Navy and the Air Force each decided 
to develop their own unique aircraft from the 27 platform combinations 
identified in the AoA to perform the core component of AEA, as shown in 
figure 2. The Navy opted to develop the EA-18G Growler, a derivative of 
the F/A-18F, as its core component. The Air Force decided to develop an 
electronic attack variant of the B-52, designated the EB-52 SOJ 
(Standoff Jammer), to function as its core component of the AoA 
solution and an unmanned combat air vehicle and an unmanned decoy as 
the expendable stand-in components of its AEA AoA solution. The Marine 
Corps opted to continue using the EA-6B with the ICAP III electronic 
suite in anticipation of an electronic variant of the Joint Strike 
Fighter (F-35) being developed as a replacement for its EA-6Bs. The 
combination of these service AEA solutions is shown below in the DOD 
AEA system of systems. 

Figure 2: Service-Identified Airborne Electronic Attack System of 
Systems:

Note: SAMs are surface-to-air missiles.

As a result of these changes the services have updated a memorandum of 
agreement that would allow Navy expeditionary EA-6B squadrons to be 
decommissioned between fiscal years 2009 and 2012, to be replaced by 
U.S. Air Force electronic attack capability. The Navy's aircraft would 
be dedicated to providing carrier-based AEA support to the Navy. The 
Navy determined that an inventory of 90 aircraft would be needed to 
support the Navy's core component requirement. In 2001 it was projected 
that an inventory of 108 EA-6Bs would be needed if the Navy were to 
continue to provide AEA mission support to all the services. 

In February 2006, DOD proposed to terminate two major components of the 
system of systems: the B-52 Standoff Jammer system and the Joint 
Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS). The goal of the B-52 SOJ program 
was to provide long-range jamming of sophisticated enemy air defense 
radars and communications networks, using high-powered jamming 
equipment. The Air Force believes that a standoff jamming capability is 
still required, and it is investigating the solution options, platform 
numbers, and mix to deliver this capability. As part of the 
cancellation of the B-52 SOJ, the Air Force is investigating other 
solution options and platforms to provide the standoff capability, 
including examining how the B-52 SOJ cancellation affects Navy plans to 
retire the expeditionary squadrons of EA-6Bs. The goal of the J-UCAS 
program is to demonstrate the technical feasibility and operational 
value of a networked system of high-performance and weaponized unmanned 
air vehicles. 

Changes in Operational Concept and Upgrades Extend Operational 
Viability of the EA-6B, but Quantities Are Insufficient to Meet 
Identified Requirements: 

The conclusion of the May 2002 AoA report that the EA-6B inventory 
would be insufficient past 2009 was not based on the Navy's requirement 
for 90 aircraft, but on an inventory requirement of 108 aircraft that 
would meet the needs of all services. The decision to move to a system 
of systems using multiple aircraft types means the Navy will no longer 
be required to support all of DOD's electronic attack requirements. As 
a result, EA-6B aircraft will be able to meet the Navy's suppression of 
enemy air defense needs through at least 2017 and the needs of the 
Marine Corps through 2025 as long as sufficient numbers of the aircraft 
are outfitted with ICAP III electronics suites. If the Navy is required 
to support all services, given the recent Air Force proposal to 
terminate the EB-52 standoff jammer program, additional EA-6Bs may 
require the ICAP III upgrade. 

According to program officials, the EA-6B ICAP III electronic suite 
upgrade was determined to be operationally effective and suitable in 
2005 and has proven to be significantly better than the ICAP II 
electronic suite that is currently in use on all but a few EA-6Bs. 
However, while the EA-6B inventory decline has been postponed, the 
planned number of aircraft that would receive the ICAP III electronic 
suite upgrade has been significantly reduced, leaving most EA-6Bs with 
a shortfall in electronic attack capability against some current and 
future threats. Production of the EA-6B ICAP III upgrade is scheduled 
to end after the 2006 buy. 

System of Systems Decision Reduces the Inventory Requirement for the 
Navy: 

Program officials said that DOD's 2002 decision to move to a system of 
systems concept has reduced the inventory requirement for the Navy from 
108 aircraft to 90 aircraft. The Navy determined that an inventory of 
90 aircraft would be needed to support Navy's core component 
requirement. An inventory of 108 EA-6Bs would be needed if the Navy 
were to continue to provide electronic attack mission support to all 
the services. The memorandum of agreement between the services, in 
which the EA-6B has been the sole provider of electronic attack since 
1996, allows the Navy expeditionary squadrons to be decommissioned 
between fiscal year 2009 and 2012 and replaced by the U.S. Air Force's 
EB-52 standoff jammer. However, the Air Force has recently canceled the 
EB-52 jammer. 

As shown in figure 3, the EA-6B inventory levels are now expected to be 
sufficient to meet the Navy's requirement for 90 aircraft through at 
least 2017 and the Marine Corps requirement for 31 aircraft through 
2025. Procurement and replacement of 114 wing center sections for the 
EA-6B, begun in 1998, have been made on 94 aircraft and are ongoing. A 
few aircraft have received more than one wing center replacement 
because of heavy use. As a result, program officials identified the 
fatigue life of the fuselage as the determining factor in projected 
inventory levels. The official estimated life analysis of the EA-6B was 
conducted between 1984 and 1988. The aircraft used in that analysis had 
1,873 actual flight hours when the test began, and program management 
believes that factor was not considered in determining the current 
fuselage life limit. Program management has asked that updated fatigue 
life charts be developed based on this information. Program management 
predicts that this will result in an increase in fuselage life to 
14,000 hours, as shown in the solid line in figure 3. In addition, 
according to program officials extended inventory life can be obtained 
by procuring 32 additional EA-6B wing center sections at an estimated 
cost of $170 million. This would result in an inventory of over 90 EA- 
6Bs through 2019. This projected inventory is represented by the dashed 
line in figure 3. However, according to program officials, Northrop 
Grumman Corporation will wrap up wing center section production late 
this summer, and any new wing center section production would have to 
be placed on order this year to avoid additional startup and production 
break costs.

Electronic Suite Upgrade Is More Capable, but Quantities Are 
Insufficient to Meet Requirements: 

While the inventory of EA-6Bs is now projected to meet the Navy's 
inventory needs through 2017, most of that inventory will be less able 
to address some current and future threats than recently anticipated. 
According to program documents, the ICAP II tactical jamming system, 
currently installed on most EA-6B aircraft, is limited in its ability 
to conduct numerous critical functions. Its receivers and integrated 
connectivity are limiting factors in the ICAP II's ability to detect, 
locate, and react to threat systems. Threat systems have become more 
sophisticated and incorporate advanced technology, severely limiting 
current ICAP II equipped EA-6Bs' receivers' ability to detect and 
identify threats. The ICAP III upgrade, at an estimated cost of $11.7 
million per aircraft for the last four upgrades, provides selective 
reactive jamming capability; accurate emitter geolocation; full azimuth 
coverage; and a flexible command and control warfare core system that 
can integrate and coordinate multiple EA-6Bs to match any threat 
density, as well as the ability to integrate and control other manned 
or unmanned command and control warfare assets. Program officials 
project that a lower unit cost could be achieved if higher quantities 
are procured. 

Recent operational test and evaluation (OPEVAL) results for the EA-6B 
equipped with the ICAP III electronic suite have determined it to be 
operationally effective and suitable. Since these results, Navy 
operations and training units have flown and observed two EA-6B 
squadrons upgraded with ICAP III and found the upgrade to be 
significantly more capable than EA-6B aircraft equipped with the ICAP 
II electronic suite. According to Navy users who flew the EA-6B with 
ICAP III during a recent training detachment, the ICAP III system 
demonstrated a 30 percent increase in jamming effectiveness over the 
ICAP II. More data on the superior performance of ICAP III relative to 
the ICAP II system will become available as results from its first 
deployment, which just recently occurred, develop. 

Although the ICAP III-equipped EA-6Bs have been found to be 
significantly more capable, the numbers of aircraft that are funded to 
receive the ICAP III upgrade has been reduced compared with earlier DOD 
intentions to fully upgrade all EA-6Bs. Currently 14 EA-6B aircraft 
have been funded to receive the ICAP III upgrade, because of funding 
reductions, development test results, and the decision in 2003 to 
replace the EA-6B with the EA-18G. 

According to Navy and Marine Corps requirements officials, fitting only 
14 EA-6Bs with ICAP III is not sufficient to allow for the transition 
to the EA-18G without leaving them with an airborne electronic attack 
capability shortfall against some current and future threats. They 
believe that between 21 (to meet the Navy requirement) and 31 (to meet 
the Marine Corps requirement) EA-6Bs should be fitted with ICAP III to 
address this shortfall. However, an analysis provided by the EA-6B 
program office concluded that 44 ICAP III aircraft would be needed to 
meet both Navy and Marine Corps requirements. We have not validated the 
number of aircraft Navy and Marine Corps officials identified as 
needed. Because of recent decisions affecting Air Force electronic 
attack near-term capabilities, additional EA-6Bs may be needed if the 
Navy is tasked to support the electronic attack requirements of all 
services beyond 2010. However, increasing the number of EA-6Bs with 
ICAP III will not be an option if ICAP III production ends in 2006 as 
currently planned. 

EA-18G Program at Risk of Cost and Schedule Growth because It Is Not 
Following a Knowledge-Based Approach: 

The EA-18G development schedule is aggressive according to program 
officials and the DOD Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's 
2005 annual report. While the program is currently on cost and schedule 
according to program officials, our analysis shows that the program is 
not fully following the knowledge-based approach inherent in best 
practices and DOD's acquisition guidance, thus increasing the risk of 
cost growth and schedule delays. In addition, we have found that most 
research and development cost growth is reported after a program has 
passed the critical design review--the acquisition phase the EA-18G 
recently entered. Over the last several years, we have undertaken a 
body of work examining weapon system acquisition in terms of lessons 
learned from best system development practices. Successful programs 
attain high levels of knowledge in three aspects of a new product or 
weapon: technology, design, and production. If a program is not 
attaining high levels of knowledge, it incurs increased risk of 
problems, with attendant cost growth and schedule delays. The EA-18G 
airborne electronic attack program entered system development with 
immature technologies, and some of these technologies are still not 
mature. Also, while most of the design drawings are complete, it is 
possible that redesign may be needed in the future as the technologies 
mature. In addition, the Navy plans to procure a large percentage of 
the total EA-18G aircraft during low-rate initial production based on 
limited knowledge of the aircraft's ability to perform the electronic 
attack mission. This could result in the need to retrofit already 
produced EA-18G aircraft, shown in mock-up form in figure 4, a 
possibility that the Navy is already anticipating.

EA-18G Program Has Entered the Acquisition Phase Where Most Cost Growth 
is Reported: 

According to program officials, the EA-18G program is currently on cost 
and schedule. While it held its critical design review in April 2005, 
it is now in the phase where most research and development cost growth 
is recognized and reported. We recently reviewed the development cost 
experience of 29 programs that have completed their product development 
cycle--the time between the start of development and the start of 
production.[Footnote 2] We found a significant portion of the 
recognized total development cost increases of these programs took 
place after they were approximately halfway into their product 
development cycle. These increases typically occurred after the time of 
the design review of the programs. The programs experienced a 
cumulative increase in development costs of 28.3 percent throughout 
their product development. Approximately 8.5 percent of the total 
development cost growth occurred up until the time of the average 
critical design review. The remaining 19.7 percent occurred after the 
average critical design review.[Footnote 3] 

Potential for Cost Growth and Redesign Because of Technological 
Immaturity: 

Our work shows that the demonstration of technology maturity by the 
start of system development phase is a key indicator of achieving a 
match between program resources (knowledge, time, and money) and 
customer requirements. We recently reported that the cost effect of 
proceeding into product development without mature technologies can be 
dramatic.[Footnote 4] Research, development, and test and evaluation 
costs for programs that started development with mature technologies 
increased by an average of 4.8 percent, while those that began with 
immature technologies increased by an average 34.9 percent. 

In December 2003, after a truncated concept exploration phase, the EA- 
18G was approved to enter system development, in order to achieve a 
2009 initial operational capability date directed by the Chief of Naval 
Operations. Prior to entering system development, the program office 
assessed the readiness of the EA-18G's technologies and concluded that 
the system was not developing or advancing any new technologies and 
that only proven systems with minor modifications using mature 
technologies would be utilized. In addition, program officials stated 
that the EA-18G development benefited from the maturity of the F-18F 
platform and the airborne electronic attack suite currently flown on 
the EA-6B. 

Our assessment of the technology maturity of the EA-18G, however, 
differs from that offered by program officials. Over the last few 
years, we have reported on the system's progress in our annual 
assessment of selected major defense acquisition programs. We have 
reported that at the start of system development[Footnote 5] none of 
the program's five critical technologies were fully mature, and as 
recently as our March 2005 report this had not changed.[Footnote 6] 
While they are similar to the mature technologies found on the EA-6B 
and the F/A-18F, integrating those technologies on the EA-18G involves 
form and fit challenges. Three of the critical technologies--the ALQ-99 
jamming pods, the F/A-18F aircraft, and the tactical terminal system-- 
are approaching full maturity; two other technologies--the 
communications countermeasure set and the ALQ-218 receiver--are less 
mature. 

The Communications Countermeasures Set (CCS) provides communications 
detection and processing to the EA-18G. Among other things, it is used 
to degrade the effectiveness of the communications components that make 
up enemy integrated air defense systems. The existing set used on 
legacy EA-6Bs is out of production, and a replacement system is needed 
for use in the EA-18G. The new one is to be composed of new components, 
and it will function in a new environment. We believe that putting the 
CCS into the space constraints of the EA-18G platform may be a 
challenge and thus should be considered a technology risk to the 
program. 

The EA-6Bs fitted with ICAP III have a new technologically mature 
receiver, the ALQ-218, which is housed in the large space on the 
aircraft's vertical tail. The ALQ-218 receiver for the EA-18G, however, 
is being split and redesigned so it can be integrated into the 
aircraft's smaller wingtip pods. The wingtip environment is also known 
to be harsh, with noise and vibration that are known to be particularly 
severe and can degrade the reliability of receiver components. 
Isolators will be used in an attempt to lower the vibration levels. 
Since the ALQ-218 antenna elements will be subject to flexing of the 
wing that could reduce system performance, accelerometers will be 
placed in the wingtip pods to measure relative movement between the 
wingtips so that accurate threat locations can be made. In addition, 
many subcomponents also include new and modified parts, so the 
receiver's performance and delivery schedule are being tracked as risks 
to the program. Furthermore, the unique ALQ-218 wingtip covers, or 
radomes, have recently surfaced as potentially problematic. There are 
technical risks with the radome's electrical characteristics and 
environmental specifications--especially its ability to withstand hail 
strike requirements. The radome is being tracked as a high risk to the 
program because it may not meet a performance requirement. Flight tests 
on the EA-18G to measure the impact of noise and vibration on completed 
components will not start until February 2007. The performance of the 
ALQ-218 radome will not be known until flight tests that demonstrate 
its capability are conducted later this year. The maturity of the full 
ALQ-218 will not be fully known until the EA-18G aircraft completes 
flight tests with these components during developmental testing 
scheduled to start in April 2008. 

The design of the EA-18G appears stable because almost all of its 
design drawings are complete. However, the order in which knowledge is 
built throughout product development is important to delivering 
products on time and within costs. Our past work has shown that 
knowledge gaps have a cumulative effect. For example, design stability 
cannot be attained if key technologies are not mature. Until all the EA-
18G critical technologies demonstrate maturity, the potential for 
design changes remains. While the program held its system-level 
critical design review in April 2005, flight tests will be needed to 
verify the loads and environment used for some of these designs and 
determine the maturity of the critical technologies. 

Production Decision Based on Limited Demonstrated Functionality, and 
Initial Capability Provided Will Be Less than That of EA-6B ICAP III: 

The EA-18G production decision scheduled for April 2007 will be based 
on limited demonstrated functionality. The initial capability 
demonstrated in support of the production decision will be less than 
that of the ICAP III on the EA-6B. Four EA-18G aircraft will be built 
to conduct operational tests during the system development and 
demonstration test phase. The Navy plans to procure an additional one- 
third, or 30, of the EA-18G aircraft during low-rate initial production 
(LRIP), at an estimated cost of $2,297.1 million for the two low-rate 
initial production lots in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008. This 
low-rate initial production quantity is significantly higher than the 
recommended DOD acquisition target of 10 percent. The program does not 
plan to demonstrate through flight tests a fully functional production 
representative prototype until testing in April and May of 2008. In 
addition, program plans call for procuring 56 EA-18G full-rate 
production (FRP) aircraft to achieve the procurement objective of 90 
aircraft. As a result, full funding for 56 of the 90 EA-18G aircraft 
and 34 of the 56 airborne electronic attack suites will be committed 
prior to the completion of operational testing and evaluation.[Footnote 
7] This creates a risk, acknowledged by the program office, that 
redesign and retrofitting may be needed, since it will not be known how 
effective and suitable the EA-18G will be or what changes are required 
until after those tests are completed. 

The EA-18G requirements are to meet, and in some cases exceed, those of 
the EA-6B ICAP III, adding an air-to-air intercept capability and the 
ability to communicate while jamming. However, according to program 
documents the first operational test, scheduled to be completed in 
February 2007, 2 months before the low-rate initial production 
decision, will demonstrate a much more limited capability, primarily 
the ability to radiate a simple, single-source jamming assignment and 
the ability to receive, identify, and display limited simple emitters. 
Test results demonstrating full ICAP III equivalent capabilities will 
not be available until the operational evaluation scheduled to be 
completed in January 2009, 3 months before the projected full-rate 
production decision, when the third and final software release will be 
available for testing. 

The test plan is driven by software development, and the EA-18G 
software will be available for testing in three releases, or builds. 
Software is on the critical path to program completion and will provide 
the functionality that is available for testing before each production 
decision. While the program officials responsible for managing the 
software appear to be tracking all major cost, schedule, and quality 
markers, software development is still considered a moderate risk. 
Problems or delays in the initial software releases could affect the 
start of the operational evaluation. Even before that, the current 
software development schedule will not allow the program to demonstrate 
that the EA-18G system can fully function until after the program 
office has committed to producing all 30 of the low-rate initial 
production aircraft. Under the current schedule, operational testing of 
the final software release needed to demonstrate the desired 
functionality of EA-18G aircraft will not be completed until January 
2009 - 3 months before the projected full-rate production decision. 

Conclusions: 

Should the Air Force decisions to terminate its EB-52 jammer and Joint- 
Unmanned Combat Air System programs stand, the airborne electronic 
attack framework that arose after the 2002 analysis of alternatives 
will not materialize as planned. These decisions and the emergence of 
irregular threats place an added burden on the Navy's EA-6B and EA-18G 
airborne electronic attack assets and may result in an even larger gap 
in DOD's capability. 

A reduction in plans to upgrade Navy EA-6B with ICAP III electronic 
suites creates a transition shortfall in capability until the EA-18G 
becomes operational. Potential delays in the EA-18G development and 
testing effort would only aggravate this shortfall. The EA-18G 
development schedule is based on a premise--EA-6B inventory will not be 
sufficient beyond 2009--that is no longer valid for assessing the 
Navy's future needs. The inventory of EA-6B aircraft is now projected 
to be sufficient to meet Navy and Marine Corps needs for another decade 
or longer. In addition, the compressed and aggressive schedule, a 
direction given to the program office, does not allow decision makers 
to benefit from the demonstration of knowledge at critical junctures, a 
proven mitigator of risk. 

The availability of EA-6B aircraft allows DOD to consider an 
alternative to its current strategy. After determining how it will 
fulfill the warfighter's needs and address capability shortfalls, DOD 
could outfit additional EA-6B aircraft with upgraded ICAP III 
electronic suites. This option is made possible by the successful 
integration of the ICAP III electronic suite with the EA-6B aircraft 
and structural improvements. However, this would necessitate not 
closing production of these electronic suites in 2006, as presently 
planned. 

Recommendations for Executive Action: 

To mitigate the effects accruing from the shortfall in upgraded EA-6B 
aircraft, the risk of delay in the development of the EA-18G, and the 
proposed cancellation of the EB-52 jammer and the Joint-Unmanned Combat 
Air System, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the 
following two actions: 

* Determine the number of EA-6Bs equipped with ICAP III electronic 
suites necessary to deal with the existing and near-term capability 
gaps. 

* Consider procuring this necessary number of ICAP III upgrades. If DOD 
implements the option, we recommend that the department: 

* continue the EA-6B ICAP III production line after the fiscal year 
2006 buy, and: 

* restructure its EA-18G low-rate initial production plans so that 
procurement of the aircraft occurs after the aircraft has demonstrated 
full functionality. 

Agency Comments and Our Evaluation: 

DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. The 
comments appear in appendix II. 

DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of 
Defense determine the necessary number of EA-6Bs equipped with ICAP III 
electronic suites to deal with the existing and near-term capability 
gap. DOD agreed that the Navy's airborne electronic attack inventory 
needs review and has directed a study of department wide airborne 
electronic attack forces to be issued on September 15, 2006. However, 
it is unclear from DOD's response if the department's review will 
specifically identify, as we recommended, the necessary number of ICAP 
III-equipped EA-6Bs needed to address the existing and near-term 
capability gap. In light of the end of planned ICAP III production this 
year, DOD needs to identify this specific number, as it is a necessary 
prerequisite to our second recommendation. 

DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary 
of Defense consider procuring the determined number of ICAP III 
upgrades and that if DOD takes this option, the department (1) continue 
ICAP III production and (2) restructure the EA-18G low-rate initial 
production plans so that the procurement of the aircraft occurs after 
the aircraft has demonstrated full functionality. Regarding the first 
part of our recommendation, DOD agreed that it should consider 
procuring the required ICAP III upgrades, as determined by the ongoing 
airborne electronic attack review, but stated that it is premature to 
make a decision until the ICAP III inventory levels are determined. We 
agree that such determination is a prerequisite and have so stated in 
our first recommendation. However, that determination needs to be 
completed before the ICAP III production line ends in fiscal year 2006. 
With regard to the second part of our recommendation, DOD stated that 
the current EA-18G low-rate initial production plan provides the best 
balance of risk and cost to expeditiously meet warfighters' needs. We 
remain concerned that producing EA-18G aircraft before testing 
demonstrates that the design is mature unnecessarily increases the 
likelihood of design changes that will lead to cost growth, schedule 
delays, and performance problems. In the past, Congress has raised 
concerns about the costly outcomes of highly concurrent development and 
production efforts that are not "flying before buying." Starting 
production before flight tests demonstrate the full ICAP III equivalent 
capability works as intended places the $2,297.1 million low-rate 
initial production investment at significant risk. The procurement of 
additional ICAP-III-equipped EA-6Bs would allow the time to properly 
test the EA-18G before making a production decision and reduce the risk 
of costly retrofitting of the initially produced EA-18Gs. Therefore, we 
continue to believe that our recommendation should be implemented. 

We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional 
committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Air Force, 
and Navy; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Office 
of Management and Budget. We will provide copies to others on request.

Appendix I: Scope and Methodology: 

To determine if the key conclusion reached in the Department of 
Defense's (DOD) May 2002 airborne electronic attack (AEA) analysis of 
alternatives (AoA)--the projected inventory of EA-6Bs would be 
insufficient beyond 2009--is still valid, we interviewed officials in 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Strategic Command (Offutt, 
Nebraska); the Commander Electronic Attack, Pacific Fleet (Whidbey 
Island); and officials responsible for Air Force, Navy, and Marine 
Corps AEA requirements. We interviewed personnel responsible for 
Improved Capability (ICAP) III electronic warfare testing at the Office 
of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (Washington, D.C.); 
Commander of Operational Test and Evaluation Navy (Norfolk, Virginia); 
and VX-9 personnel responsible for ICAP III testing at China Lake, 
California. In addition to the reviewing 2002 AEA AoA, we reviewed 
pertinent DOD, service, and contractor documents addressing the status 
of the EA-6Bs inventory, plans for maintaining the status of EA-6B 
suppression capabilities, testing conducted for the EA-6B ICAP III 
program, the AEA system of systems, gaps in the AEA, and potential 
solutions for AEA. 

To determine whether the acquisition management approach to the Navy's 
airborne electronic attack core component, the EA-18G, is knowledge- 
based and can help forestall future risks, we reviewed pertinent DOD, 
service, and contractor documents addressing the status of the EA-18G 
development effort. We discussed airborne electronic attack issues and 
EA-18G development and production with contractor personnel at Boeing 
Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri and El Segundo, California. We 
discussed software matters with officials at China Lake and Point Mugu, 
California. We met with pilots at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, 
China Lake, Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Fallon Naval Air Station, 
and Boeing Corporation to discuss pilot workload issues given the 
transition to the two-seat EA-18G from the four-seat EA-6B. As with our 
past work on the EA-18G development effort conducted under our annual 
assessment of selected major defense acquisition programs, we focused 
our work to determining whether the program was following a knowledge- 
based acquisition approach. We met with Navy EA-18G program officials 
currently involved with the development effort to document the maturity 
status of the aircraft's critical technologies, the status of its 
design effort, and plans for producing the aircraft. 

We performed our review from May 2005 through March 2006 in accordance 
with generally accepted government auditing standards.

April 19, 2006: 

Dear Mr. Li: 

This is the Department of Defense's (DoD's) response to the Government 
Accountability Office Draft Report, "ELECTRONIC WARFARE: Option of 
Upgrading Additional EA-6Bs Could Reduce Risk in Development of EA- 
18G," dated March 16, 2006 (GAO Code 120440/GAO-06-446). The DoD 
partially concurs with the two recommendations in the draft report. 
Details of the partial concurrences are contained in the enclosure. 

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft report. 

Sincerely,

GAO DRAFT REPORT - DATED MARCH 16, 2006 GAO CODE 120440/GAO-06-446: 

"ELECTRONIC WARFARE: OPTION OF UPGRADING ADDITIONAL EA-6Bs COULD REDUCE 
RISK IN DEVELOPMENT OF EA-18G" 

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COMMENTS TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS: 

RECOMMENDATION 1: The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense 
determine the necessary number of EA-6Bs equipped with Improved 
Capability (ICAP) III electronic suites to deal with the existing and 
near-term capability gap. (p. 19/GAO Draft Report): 

DOD RESPONSE Partially Concur. The Department agrees that refinement of 
Navy Electronic Attack aircraft inventory is needed. The Deputy 
Secretary of Defense directed a review of Airborne Electronic Attack 
plans, programs, and required capabilities on December 16, 2005. The 
final report is due September 15, 2006. This AEA review will identify 
the AEA forces that the Department should maintain to meet joint needs 
across the range of military operations. 

RECOMMENDATION 2: The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense 
consider procuring the determined number of ICAP III upgrades. If DOD 
takes this option, the GAO recommends that the department: 

a. continue the EA-6B ICAP III production line after the fiscal year 
2006 buy and: 

b. restructure its EA-18G low-rate initial production plans so that 
procurement of the aircraft occurs after the aircraft has demonstrated 
full functionality. 

DOD RESPONSE: Partially Concur. The Department agrees that it should 
consider procuring required ICAP III upgrades as determined by the 
ongoing AEA review. However, it is premature to make a decision on ICAP 
III production until ICAP III inventory requirements are determined. 
The Department is confident that the EA-18G Low Rate Initial Production 
(LRIP) plan provides the best balance of risk and cost to expeditiously 
meet warfighter needs.
