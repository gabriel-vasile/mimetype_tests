<abstract>
The vegetation units on this map were determined through the stereoscopic
interpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and
ecological analysis. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the
photographs by means of the photographic signature and collateral
information on slope, hydrology, geography, and vegetation in accordance
with the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System (October
1995). The mapped vegetation reflects conditions that existed during the
specific year and season that the aerial photographs were taken. There is
a margin of error inherent in the use of aerial photographs. Therefore, a
detailed ground and historical analysis of a single site may result in a
revision of the vegetation association boundaries established through
photographic interpretation.

The mapped data have been revised by CBI personnel using data collected
during accuracy assessment field work. As a result 50 polygons were
reclassified. A contradictory classification in understory vegetation in
woodland types resulted from comparison of the photographic examination
with field-collected data. The accuracy assessment data, collected on the
ground, were selected in preference to the original mapped data. the final
spatial database is now considered to be 100% accurate.

<logic>
All polygon features are checked for topology using the ARC/INFO software.
Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All
nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features. There
are no duplicate lines or polygons. All nodes will snap together and close
polygons based on a specified tolerance. If the node is not within the
tolerance it is adjusted manually. The tests for logical consistency are
performed in ARC/INFO.

The following describes the tasks performed and methodologies used by
Aerial Information Systems (AIS) of Redlands CA, during the vegetation
data compilation for Tuzigoot National Monument. AIS was responsible for
the photointerpretation, data rectification, automation, and in
conjunction with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the National
Classification assignment. DATA COLLECTION VISIT Data collection is the
first step in the photointerpretation process. The goal is to collect
and evaluate the data sources available for the park. This includes
reviewing the imagery, basemaps, and supplemental collateral sources,
e.g. existing vegetation maps, soil surveys, etc. The data collection
visit to Tuzigoot National Monument occurred in March 1995. (Refer to
the "Tuzigoot National Monument, AIS Data Collection Report" dated May
15, 1995 for more information.) The two day visit consisted of a project
meeting with park personnel to discuss the National Vegetation mapping
program and tour the Monument. During the meeting, existing photography,
vegetation maps and geographical basemaps were reviewed and evaluated.
Potential study area boundaries and the minimum mapping unit (mmu) were
also discussed. The end result was the establishment of the digital
orthophoto as the project basemap. The study area boundary was defined
as the extent of the orthophoto image, and the mmu was set at 1/4
hectare. Project scale and aerial photography were to be determined
after a review of existing 1992 aerial photography not available for the
initial meeting. Upon evaluation of the 1992 photography it was decided
that new imagery should be acquired for the photointerpretation effort.
The resulting project photography was color-infrared (CIR) stereo-paired
diapositives, average scale 1:6,720, flown during September 1995. The
project scale was established at 1:6720. A duplicate set of photo prints
was sent to TNC for use in their field sampling effort. DEVELOPMENT OF
MAPPING CRITERIA The mapping criteria is a set of documented working
decision rules to facilitate the maintenance of accuracy and consistency
of interpretation in the database. They assist the user in understanding
the characteristics, definition, and context for each vegetation
category. A field reconnaissance visit is performed to familiarize the
photointerpreters with the vegetation types and their photo signatures
prior to the actual mapping process. The reconnaissance is an important
step in the development of the photointerpretation criteria and
signature key. For the Tuzigoot mapping effort, the field reconnaissance
task was not performed. Due to the small size of the study area, it was
decided that enough information had been gathered during the initial
visit to proceed with the photointerpretation process. The mapping
criteria was developed using the standard mapping conventions as a base.
Additions to the criteria pertaining to specific situations found at the
Monument are described below. Gutierrezia sarothrae, classified as a
sub-shrub, was placed in the herbaceous stature category. Prosopis
velutina, which can occur as either a tree or a shrub, was mapped in
both the tree stature and shrub stature categories. The tree form of
Prosopis was mapped in the toeslope and bosque areas, while the shrub
form was mapped in the drier desert plain locations.

The following continues to describe the tasks performed and
methodologies used by Aerial Information Systems (AIS) during the
vegetation data compilation for Tuzigoot National monument.
PHOTOINTERPRETATION OF VEGETATION: Photointerpretation is the process of
identifying map units based on their photo signature. All land cover
features have a photo signature. These signatures are defined by color,
texture, pattern, and tone on the aerial photography. By observing the
context and extent of the photo signatures associated with specific
vegetation types, the photointerpreter is able to identify and delineate
the boundaries of the vegetation. Additional collateral sources, e.g.
existing vegetation map, supplemental photography, soil data, etc., can
be of great utility to the photointerpreter. Understanding the
relationship between the vegetation and the context in which they appear
is very useful in the interpretation process. Familiarity with regional
differences also helps interpretation by establishing a context for a
specific area. At Tuzigoot National Monument, the photointerpretation
was done using a stereoscope to view the CIR stereo-paired diapositives.
The delineations and codes representing the vegetation categories were
annotated directly onto a mylar overlay registered to the CIR image. The
delineations and codes were edge matched between photos to ensure a
seamless coverage in the database. Any uncertain interpretations were
flagged on the mylar overlay for review during the quality control step.
QUALITY CONTROL OF PHOTOINTERPRETATIONS: A quality control step is
performed after the photointerpretation task to ensure the accuracy and
consistency of the interpretations. Once the initial mapping was
completed for the Monument, the photo overlays with the delineations and
attributes were given to senior interpreters for review and comment. The
interpreted overlays were checked for completeness, consistency, and
adherence to the mapping criteria and guidelines. For those polygons
flagged by the photointerpreter, the reviewer either assigned the
appropriate vegetation code or left the polygon flagged for field
verification. FIELD VERIFICATION: The field verification task ensures
that the data layer produced is as error free as possible. The photos
and interpreted mylar overlays are taken into the field by the
photointerpreters. During the on-site visit, map units flagged during
the photointerpretation effort are reviewed in the field and the
necessary changes and corrections are made directly onto the photo
overlays. At Tuzigoot National Monument, the field verification task was
conducted over a three day period concurrent with TNC's field sampling
effort in the latter part of October 1995.

In conjunction with the photoverification and field sampling effort, NBS
(now USGS, BRD, CBI) personnel performed a locational accuracy test
comparing the accuracy of a global positioning system (GPS) versus
manual location techniques. The TNC biologist "pin-pricked" all of the
sample site locations onto the aerial photos while the NBS staff
captured the location using GPS. The "pin-pricked" locations were
subsequently input into the GIS database for comparison against the GPS
locations for the same site.

The following continues to describe the tasks performed and
methodologies used by Aerial Information Systems (AIS) during the
vegetation data compilation for Tuzigoot National monument. DATA
CONVERSION: Typically, the first step of the data conversion process is
the manual rectification of the delineations from the unrectified aerial
photos to a hardcopy of the project basemap. However, the hardcopy
orthophoto for Tuzigoot was of such coarse resolution that manual
rectification was impossible. The manual rectification task was bypassed
and the delineations were manuscripted directly from the non-rectified
photos and scanned. The scanned images were then rectified to the
digital orthophoto image in the computer. The computer rectification
process included three major steps; the initial transformation
where geographic coordinates were assigned to the data. This step involved
picking a set of control points that corresponded to both the orthophoto
image and the aerial photography. The second and third steps consisted
of "refining" the rectified data. The second step consisted of selecting
numerous "link" points in the computer over the entire study area to
further tie the vegetation units to the orthophoto image. The third and
final step was to locally adjust the vegetation units to the orthophoto
image by repeating the "link" points procedure over small areas of the
image. One of the biggest challenges encountered during the Tuzigoot
mapping project was the computer rectification of the delineations. The
reason for this was the CIR imagery and the orthophotos were not
concurrent with one another: the CIR imagery was taken in 1995; the
orthophoto was created from imagery taken in 1992. Even under normal
circumstances it is difficult to correlate between imagery taken in
different years or even different seasons in some instances. However,
the rapidly changing environmental conditions compounded the problem at
Tuzigoot. For example; due to recent flooding, the Verdy River has moved
northward in the last three years. It's location was mapped according to
the 1995 image which does not match the position of the river on the
orthophoto. The user needs to be aware of the impact regarding this
situation. Any questions regarding the delineation of vegetation
polygons should be referenced back to the 1995 CIR imagery, not the
orthophoto basemap. The next task was to join the attribute data to the
spatial information in the computer. Normally, this step is done prior
to scanning and the spatial and attribute data are joined together
during the automation process. In order to input the attribute codes for
Tuzigoot, a plot was created of the vegetation delineations. The attribute
data was transferred from the photo overlays to a mylar
overlay code sheet (CS) registered to the plot. Each polygon was
assigned a unique sequence number identification. The attributes were
keypunched into a spreadsheet format and then joined with the spatial
data in the GIS. The attribute and spatial data were QC'd for accuracy
and completeness of input. Edit plots were created for the vegetation
delineations, the height, density and floristic composition
characteristics and compared back to the original delineations and CS.
Corrections were made as needed and input into the computer. A final
quality control of the photointerpretation was performed by creating a
"consist" program. The program pulled out inconsistencies in attribute
coding, e.g. if tree taxa was listed for a polygon and there was no
height/density attributes assigned, it would be flagged for
investigation and correction. CONVERSION OF PHOTO PRIMITIVES TO THE
NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION: The final step of the mapping process is the
conversion of the photo primitives to the National Classification. Once
the photo primitives were input into the GIS, they were converted to the
National Classification through ecologist supported computer modeling
techniques. Using field sample site information, the
Alliance/Association classes were extrapolated to polygons sharing like
aspects in the same regional area. A preliminary vegetation map was
created and then reviewed by TNC field biologists for accuracy. If
necessary, revisions to the delineations or the computer model were made
and another map was produced for review. This process was repeated until
the TNC biologists approved of all classification assignments. The photo
primitives mapped for Tuzigoot National Monument were converted to the
national Classification during a two day meeting at AIS. A preliminary
vegetation map with the national Classification designations and sample
site locations was produced using computer modeling techniques. TNC,
working in conjunction with AIS, reviewed the preliminary map by
comparing it back to the CIR photos and TNCs field data sheets.
Additional delineations were added to the database, separating the
classes on the basis of abiotic factors, e.g. landform type and past
environmental conditions. The computer model was adjusted and another
map was created, reviewed, and revised, using the same methodology as
described above. In all, there were five iterations of this process
before the final classification assignments were completed. as a result
of this process, the National Classification for the Monument was
revised to include four additional classes.

collected during accuracy assessment field work. As a result 50 polygons
were reclassified. A contradictory classification in understory
vegetation in woodland types resulted from comparison of the
photographic examination with field-collected data. The accuracy
assessment data, collected on the ground, were selected in preference to
the original mapped data.

<overview>
<eaover>
The system is organized hierarchically to support conservation and
resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels
of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the
vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international
standards developed by the United nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the
hierarchy are based on the species composition of existing vegetation
(floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were
originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification
is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field
data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the NBS/NPS
mapping efforts.
Data file attributes include vegetation height, density, species,
alliance, community element, and land cover. LAYER CHARACTERISTIC CODES:
