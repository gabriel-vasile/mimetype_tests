    <h4><strong>
      Modeling Relativistic Pulsar Winds</strong></h4>
    <p>
      J. Arons, D. C. Backer, A. Spitkovsky, and V. M. Kaspi, &quot;Probing relativistic 
      winds: The case of PSRJ07370-3039 A &amp; B,&quot; in Proceedings of the 
      2004 Aspen Winter Conf. on Astrophysics: Binary Radio Pulsars, F. A. Rasio 
      and I. H. Stairs, eds.; astro-ph/0404159 (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, 
      NASA, NSF</strong></font></p>
    <p>In late 2003, radio astronomers discovered the first binary star system 
      containing two neutron stars, both of which are observable as radio pulsars. 
      The pulsars eclipse each other, even though the neutron stars are much too 
      small to be the obscuring obstacles. The luminosity of pulsar A suggests 
      that its relativistic wind is confining the magnetosphere of pulsar B to 
      be 30% of the size it would have if B existed in isolation. Within several 
      weeks of the discovery, Arons et al. created a simulation of A&#8217;s eclipses 
      based on synchrotron absorption in a shocked pulsar wind colliding with 
      the magnetosphere of pulsar B (Figure 3). So far their model is the best 
      developed model of the system, and their predictions are continuing to be 
      confirmed by observations. </p>

    <h4>Disappearing Neutrinos Reappear</h4>
    <p> The KamLAND Collaboration, T. Araki et al., &#8220;Measurement of neutrino oscillation with KamLAND: Evidence of spectral distortion,&#8221; Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>94</b>, 081801 (2005). <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, JMECSST, FEPCJ, KMSC</strong></font> </p>
    <p>In previous experiments at the KamLAND underground neutrino detector, it was reported that the electron neutrinos were disappearing, i.e., oscillating into the neutrino flavors that are not detectable. With more data and more precise measurements, the disappearing neutrinos have been shown to be oscillating back into the detectable electron neutrinos. This is the most direct evidence yet of neutrino oscillation. These results constitute further proof that neutrinos have mass and that the Standard Model describing fundamental particles will need to be amended. </p>
    <h4>High-Resolution Cosmology</h4>

      W. L. Holzapfel, A. E. Lange, M. Lueker, M. Newcomb, J. B. Peterson, J. 
      Ruhl, M. C. Runyan, and E. Torbet, &#8220;High-resolution observations of 
      the cosmic microwave background power spectrum with ACBAR,&#8221; Astrophys. 
      J. <b>600</b>, 32 (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>HEP, NASA, NSF, 
      CARA</strong></font> <br />
      <br />
      The Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) is an instrument 
      designed to produce detailed images of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) 
      in three millimeter-wavelength bands. Kuo et al. employed new analysis techniques 
      designed specifically for high-sensitivity ground-based CMB observations 
      and reported the first measurements of CMB anisotropy from ACBAR &#8212; 
      the highest signal-to-noise ratio observations to date. Overall, the resulting 
      power spectrum appears to be consistent with the damped acoustic oscillations 
      expected in standard cosmological models.

    <h4>The Physics of Star Formation</h4><p>
      M. R. Krumholz, C. F. McKee, and R. I. Klein, &#8220;Bondi accretion in 
      the presence of vorticity,&#8221; Astrophys. J. (in press); astro-ph/0409454 
      (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, NASA, NSF</strong></font><br />
      <br />
      The formation of high-mass stars remains one of the most significant unsolved 
      problems in astrophysics. The classical Bondi-Hoyle formula for the accretion 
      of gas onto a point particle is incomplete because it does not take vorticity 
      into account, and even a small amount of vorticity can substantially affect 
      accretion. Using a combination of simulations and analytic treatment, Krumholz 
      et al. have provided an approximate formula for the accretion rate of gas 
      onto a point particle as a function of the vorticity of the surrounding 
      gas. Their results have potential implications for models of star formation 
      in which protostars gain mass through a process of competitive accretion.

      Neutrinos in Core-Collapse Supernovae</h4><p>
      A. Juodagalvis, K. Langanke, G. Martinez-Pinedo, W. R. Hix, D. J. Dean, 
      and J. M. Sampaio, &#8220;Neutral-current neutrino&#8211;nucleus cross sections 
      for <em>A</em> ~ 50&#8211;65 nuclei,&#8221; Nucl. Phys. A <b>747</b>, 87 (2005). 
      <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, SciDAC, NSF, DRC, MCyT, ERDF, PFST</strong></font><br />
      <br />
      Neutrino&#8211;nucleus reactions play an essential role in the explosions 
      of core-collapse supernovae, but inelastic neutrino&#8211;nucleus scattering 
      has not yet been incorporated into supernova simulations, which may be one 
      reason why these simulations often fail to yield explosions. Juodagalvis 
      et al. studied neutral-current neutrino&#8211;nucleus reaction cross sections 
      for Mn, Fe, Co and Ni isotopes, presenting the cross sections as functions 
      of initial and final neutrino energies and for a range of supernova-relevant 
      temperatures. These cross sections will allow improved estimates of inelastic 
      neutrino reactions on nuclei to be used in supernova simulations. </p><h4>Modeling Galaxy&#8211;Mass Correlations</h4><p>
      A. Tasitsiomi, A. V. Kravtsov, R. H. Wechsler, and J. R. Primack, &#8220;Modeling 
      galaxy&#8211;mass correlations in dissipationless simulations,&#8221; Astrophys. 
      J. <b>614</b>, 533 (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>HEP, NSF, NASA, 
      KICP</strong></font><br />
      <br />
      Understanding the processes that shape the clustering of dark matter and 
      galaxies is one of the main goals of observational cosmology. Tasitsiomi 
      et al. used high-resolution, dissipationless simulations of the concordance 
      flat LCDM model to predict galaxy&#8211;mass correlations and compare them 
      with the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey weak-lensing measurements. They 
      found that assigning a luminosity to a dark-matter halo of a certain maximum 
      circular velocity by matching the simulated subhalo velocity function to 
      the observed luminosity function leads to good agreement with the observed 
      galaxy&#8211;mass correlation and its dependence on luminosity, if an observationally 
      motivated amount of scatter between luminosity and circular velocity is 
      introduced.<strong> </strong> </p>
	  
	  <h4>High-Energy Stellar Jets</h4><p>
      W. Zhang, S. E. Woosley, and A. Heger, &#8220;The propagation and eruption 
      of relativistic jets from the stellar progenitors of gamma-ray bursts,&#8221; 
      Astrophys. J. <b>608</b>, 365 (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>HEP, 
      SciDAC, NASA</strong></font></h4><p>
      Zhang et al. have conducted 2D and 3D calculations of relativistic jet propagation 
      and breakout in massive Wolf-Rayet stars, which are thought to be responsible 
      for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). As it erupts, the highly relativistic jet core 
      is surrounded by a cocoon of less energetic but still moderately relativistic 
      ejecta that expands and becomes visible at larger polar angles. These less 
      energetic ejecta may be the origin of X-ray flashes and other high-energy 
      transients. Calculations of jet stability showed that if the jet changes 
      angle by more than 3&deg; in several seconds, it will dissipate, producing 
      a broad beam with inadequate Lorentz factor to make a common GRB, but possibly 
      enough to make an X-ray flash (Figure 4). </p>
      <p class="lfImg" style="width:348px"><img src="../../assets/img/research-news/woosley.jpg" width="350" height="336" /> Figure 4. Jet angle sensitivity study. Slices of the precessing jet models are shown just after breakout. For model 3P3, the jet emerges relatively intact and might produce a GRB. The jets in models 3P5 and especially 3P10 dissipate their energy before escaping and are unlikely to produce GRBs, although they may still produce hard X-ray flashes.</p>

      <h4>Holes in Type Ia Supernovae</h4><p>
      D. Kasen, P. Nugent, R. C. Thomas, and L. Wang, &#8220;Could there be a 
      hole in Type Ia supernovae?&#8221; Astrophys. J. <b>610</b>, 876 (2004). 
      <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, NASA</strong></font><br />
      <br />
      Type Ia supernovae arise from a white dwarf accreting material from a companion 
      star. Soon after the white dwarf explodes, the ejected supernova material 
      engulfs the companion star, which carves out a conical hole in the supernova 
      ejecta. Kasen et al. used multidimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer 
      calculations to explore the observable consequences of an ejecta-hole asymmetry. 
      They found that when one looks almost directly down the hole, the supernova 
      is relatively brighter and has a peculiar spectrum characterized by more 
      highly ionized species, weaker absorption features, and lower absorption 
      velocities. Ejecta-hole asymmetry may explain the current spectropolarimetric 
      observations of Type Ia supernovae. </p>

      <h4>Improving the Efficiency of Simulations</h4>
      <p>F. D. Swesty, D. C. Smolarski, and P. E. Saylor, &#8220;A comparison of 
      algorithms for the efficient solution of the linear systems arising from 
      multigroup flux-limited diffusion problems,&#8221; Astrophys. J. Supp. <b>153</b>, 
      369 (2004). <font color="#336699"><strong>NP, SciDAC, NASA, ASAP</strong></font><br />
      </p>
      <p>Multi-group flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) is a popular method for modeling 
      the multidimensional flow of radiation in a wide variety of astrophysical 
      phenomena, but solving the sparse linear systems that arise in this method 
      is computationally expensive. Swesty et al. compared the effectiveness of 
      certain iterative sparse linear system methods for the solution of implicitly 
      differenced MGFLD equations. They found that certain combinations of algorithms 
      and preconditioners consistently outperform others for a series of test 
      problems (Figure 5), and that the method of preparing the linear system 
      for solution by scaling the system has a dramatic effect on the convergence 
      behavior of the iterative methods.</p>
