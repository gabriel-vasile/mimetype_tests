                                    <p>A common frivolous argument on employment tax returns is the CFR/ IRC 861 scheme. This argument targets employers and advises
                                       them that wages are exempt from withholding. Employers participating in the  IRC 861 scheme often file returns to amend all
                                       prior tax returns reflecting no tax liability and requesting refunds of some or all taxes previously reported (see  IRM 21.7.2.4.17.6.12).
                                       Submission Processing will pull Forms 941 showing no tax and requesting refund of withholding. Submission Processing may also
                                       refer Forms 941c during initial screening of incoming returns.

                                 <p>For purposes of imposing a penalty under sections 6694 or 6695, an income tax return preparer is any person who prepares for

                                    a substantial portion of any return or any claim for refund of tax. The preparation of a substantial portion of a return or

                                    be considered for civil injunction, penalty assessment, or no action.

                                 <p>Cases referred for section 6694 penalties are usually those with frivolous filings that are limited in number and in which
                                    the preparer has stopped preparing returns. They may be assessed under section 6694(a) ($250) and (b) ($750) together for
                                    a total of $1,000 or section 6694(b) ($1,000) alone. Paragraph (a) carries an ASED of two years from the due date of the taxpayer's
                                    return for which the penalty is being assessed and paragraph (b) carries no ASED requirement; however, paragraph (a) requires
                                    a less severe burden of proof. Therefore, whenever there are more than six months remaining on the assessment statutes, refer
                                    for assessment penalties under both (a) and (b) for any applicable tax periods and (b) alone for those with less than six
                                    months remaining on the assessment statute.

                                    <p>IRM 20.1 directs that penalty cases should be conducted independently of and without regard to the determination of the income
                                       tax case. The tax case has bearing on the penalty on the  IRC section 6694 case only insofar as assertion of the penalty requires
                                       an understatement of tax. A preparer penalty case is not an income tax investigation of the preparer. If there are indications
                                       that the preparer is participating in the scheme or is otherwise in need of audit (fails to file, etc.,) refer the preparer
                                       income tax case to the applicable PSP.

                                 non-compliance. The nature of tax avoidance has insidious effects. When undetected, illegal tax avoidance grows with long-lasting

                                 public trust is endangered.
