     To analyze the results of the aggregate study, various phase
fractions were measured as a function of distance in pixels from
the aggregate surface by adding up the pixels in concentric
squares around the aggregate, and averaging over 5-10 independent
realizations of the cement paste-aggregate system.  In each
realization, the cement particles were &quot;parked&quot; using a different
set of random numbers.  The initial work was done using circular
particles with the same 21 pixel diameter, like those shown on
Fig. <a href="node2.html#Figure 1a.">1a</a>, in a unit cell with an edge length of 500
pixels.  Figs. <a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a> and <a href="#Figure 2b.">2b</a> 
show the results of
the phase fraction measurements.  In  Fig. <a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a>, 
porosity,
as a function of distance in pixels from the aggregate edge, is
plotted.  The upper curve, marked, &quot;Original&quot;, is the porosity of
the original packing, before any simulated hydration has taken
place.  A large porosity peak can be seen close to the aggregate
surface, due to the fact that particles cannot be packed as efficiently near 
an edge as in bulk space.  In this case, the aggregate surface is acting as 
the edge.  The porosity then decreases to its bulk value, with some 
oscillations due to the discrete nature of the cement particles.  The lower 
curve, marked &quot;Hydrated&quot;, is the porosity after <IMG  ALIGN=bottom 
ALT="" SRC="alpha.gif"> = 0.855 hydration.  A higher-porosity peak is clearly 
visible, and extends approximately 10-15 pixels until the final bulk value of 
the porosity is reached.  Using the scale of the problem previously mentioned, 
that means that the interfacial zone in the model is of the order of 10-15 
micrometers wide.  This width is in reasonable agreeement with experimental 
results of 10-50 micrometers for the interfacial zone width 
[<A HREF="node6.html#r4">4</A>,<A HREF="node6.html#r5">5</A>].

<P>Fig. <a href="#Figure 2b.">2b</a> shows all the phase
fractions, after hydration, plotted as functions of distance from
the aggregate surface.  It is clear that the fraction of CH
increases near the aggregate surface, in agreement with
experiment [<A HREF="node6.html#r6">6</A>,<A HREF="node6.html#r7">7</A>].  This arises naturally in the model, as
CH pixels have a uniform probability to nucleate anywhere in the
pore space, so that there would tend to be more in regions of
high porosity.  Also, there is more room for the CH clusters to
grow in the higher-porosity interfacial zone.  The small dip in
the amount of CH shown in Fig. <a href="#Figure 2b.">2b</a>, at distances less
than 3-4 pixels from the aggregate edge, can be explained by the
fact that CH clusters very near to the aggregate have their
growth limited on that side by the presence of the aggregate
itself.  The amount of C<sub><font size=2>3</font size></sub>S is low near the 
aggregate surface, due
to the original packing, and the C-S-H fraction is consequently
low in that region as well.  </p>

<P>Figs. <a href="#Figure 3a.">3a</a> and <a href="#Figure 3b.">3b</a> are the 
equivalent of
Figs. <a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a> and <a href="#Fiugre 2b.">2b</a>, but for a 
mixture of four
different size cement particles, where the 21 pixel diameter
particles used previously are now the largest of the four sizes
used.  The cement particles were placed in order of decreasing
size, as in a real mixing process the larger particles could
always push the smaller particles aside.  This enables the larger
particles to go anywhere, with the smaller particles filling in
around them.  The results are basically the same, with the width
of the interfacial zone porosity peak in of Fig. <a href="#Figure 3a.">3a
</a> slightly reduced when compared to of Fig. <a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a>.  
The height of the porosity peak is also reduced, from a value of 50% down
to 44%, because of the smaller particles that can fill in some
of the spaces between the larger particles near the aggregate
edge.  The width of the peak is still clearly controlled by the
largest particles, however, since the width is only slightly
reduced from part a) of Fig. <a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a>.

<p>By comparing the original and hydrated porosities, it is
clear that the initial placement of cement particles around the
aggregate plays a large role in the formation of the interfacial
zone.  This has been suggested before [<A HREF="node6.html#r5">5</A>] as the main cause
of the interfacial zone porosity.  The initial particle placement
effect has certainly been corroborated in the model results
described above.  However, after watching the actual simulations
take place, another factor that could play a role in interfacial
zone formation suggested itself.
<P>Consider a typical point in the pore space of the hydrating
cement paste, far enough away from the aggregate surface to be
well outside the interfacial zone.  On average, this point has
new material (C-S-H and CH) growing into it from all directions,
due to the isotropy of the random packing and random growth
processes.  Now consider a point in the pore space that is close
to the aggregate surface.  There is no growth towards this point
from the direction of the aggregate, as the aggregate is non-
reactive and does not supply dissolved species, so that the net
supply of new material into this point is reduced from that of
the previous case.  We call this the &quot;one-sided growth&quot; effect. 
This effect should also contribute to the higher porosity in the
interfacial zone, although to a lesser extent than the initial
particle placement effect.  Experimentally, it would be
impossible to separate the two effects.  However, this becomes
possible, using the digital simulation model, in the following way.  </p>

</a></p>
<P>If the effect of the aggregate edge on the particle
placement could be eliminated, then any interfacial zone present
after hydration would be due only to the one-sided growth effect. 
To accomplish this, the initial structure was generated in a
different way.  The cement particles were placed in the box
first, and then the aggregate particle was added in the center. 
Any cement particle pixels that were overlaid by the aggregate
were then turned into aggregate pixels.  This totally eliminates
the edge effect of the aggregate, as the cement particles were
placed completely independently of the position of the aggregate. 
Fig. <a href="#Figure 4a.">4a</a> shows the initial packing for one 
realization of
this version of the model, and Fig. 
<a href="#Figure 4b.">4b</a> shows the same
system after <IMG  ALIGN=bottom ALT="" SRC="alpha.gif"> = 0.807 hydration.  
Fig. <a href="#Figure 5.">5</a> clearly
shows that the edge effect of the aggregate was totally
eliminated, as the porosity of the original system, marked
&quot;Original&quot;, is completely flat, except for the small amount of
noise remaining after averaging over ten independent configurations.  There can be no contribution to an enhanced interfacial zone porosity from the original 
packing.  However, the one-sided growth effect, if real, would be unaffected.  
In Fig. <a href="#Figure 5.">5</a>, the porosity after hydration is shown in 
the curve marked &quot;Hydrated&quot;, which clearly shows a small 
enhanced-porosity interfacial zone peak, due entirely to the one-sided growth 
effect.  This peak is much narrower than the porosity peaks shown in Figs. 
<a href="#Figure 2a.">2a</a> and <a href="#Figure 3a.">3a</a>, but has approximately half the height.  Therefore, the one-sided growth effect makes an important contribution to the 
interfacial zone only on small length scales, say 0-5 micrometers, while the 
aggregate edge effect on cement particle packing dominates the larger (5-50 
micrometers) length scales.
