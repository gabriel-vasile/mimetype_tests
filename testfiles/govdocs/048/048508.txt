Message-ID: <65423178-F949-450B-92AE-F5626C4E9B91@comcast.net>

Colleagues,

For several years, as a volunteer service, I have published the  
Literacy List, a large online collection of free Adult Basic  
Education and English language (ELL/ESL/ESOL) Web sites, electronic  
discussion lists ("listservs"), and other Internet resources for  
adult basic skills learners, teachers and tutors.

I have just updated it, removing a few outdated links and adding new  
ones.  Please have a look.  If you know of a good free Web site  
resource which you think should be added, please let me know.  The  
Literacy List gets better as a result of teachers sharing their  
favorite online resources.

You will find the Literacy List now in two locations:

	http://alri.org/literacylist.html

or

	http:newsomeassociates.com (Select Publications at the Bottom of the  
Page)

All the best in 2006.

>Adolescent English language learners (ELLs) are a growing population in
>secondary schools and a steady presence in postsecondary (adult)
>education programs. Many of you have experienced the unique
>characteristics and needs that adolescent ELLs present in the adult ESL
>classroom. Like their adult counterparts, some of these adolescents may
>be undocumented or may not have high literacy or education levels in
>their native languages. They may be trying to juggle work, education,
>community, and family responsibilities both here and in their native
>countries. Some may be struggling with cross-generational reunification
>issues. Others may have been born and raised in the U.S. but failed to
>succeed in traditional K-12 schooling. Despite their varied educational,
>social, and cultural backgrounds, these adolescents have one thing in
>common - their developmental stage and related needs may set them apart
>from the adult students in your classes.
>
>As high school exit criteria grow more demanding in the United States,
>students with limited or interrupted schooling are finding it difficult
>to graduate within the timeframes traditionally allocated for high
>school study. As a result, these students are turning to adult education
>to earn high school diplomas, increase their job skills, and improve
>their English language proficiency. On February 8-14 Sarah Young, author
>of Adolescent Learners in Adult ESL Classes,
>http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/adolescent.html  will lead
>a discussion and respond to questions about this topic.
>
>Sarah is an instructor at the Arlington Education and Employment Program
>(REEP) in Arlington, Virginia. She is also an adult ESL content
>specialist at the Center for Applied Linguistics where she works on
>several projects related to adolescent and adult English language
>learners.
>
>On February 8, Sarah will summarize some of the issues related to
>adolescents studying in adult ESL/ESOL classrooms (e.g., who these
>learners are and why they are in adult ESL/ESOL classes, what
>instructional strategies may work well with this population, what types
>of educational opportunities may be available).

>To review the topic before the discussion, please read brief (above),

Subject: [ProgramLeadership] welcome
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20060207150847.014f6278@pop.utk.edu>

Welcome to the Program Leadership and Improvement Discussion List!  There 
have been many new subscribers since the start of the year, so I wanted to 
send a special greeting to say that we are glad you have joined the list.

For those who are new, please consider posting a brief message introducing 
yourself, describing the type of work you do, and noting any particular 
areas of interest you have within the field.   "Program leadership" and 
"program improvement" mean different things to different people, and I hope 
that this list can address a variety of topics that fall within this wide 
spectrum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an upcoming event on the discussion list which may interest you. 
We are working to schedule two guests from community-based ABE/ESOL 
programs who recently participated in a UPS Foundation-funded "Leadership 
for Community Literacy" Initiative that was administered by the Equipped 
for the Future (EFF) Center.

After implementing a program improvement model based on the EFF Standards 
and Quality Program Practices, the five participants in this project wrote 
about their experiences. Their "Stories of Program Improvement" will be 
added to the Program Leadership and Improvement Special Collection web site 
[http://pli.cls.utk.edu] within the next month.  You will have a chance to 
read the stories first, and then ask specific questions of the guests about 
their particular experiences.  (An announcement will be posted once the 
dates are firm.)

In the meantime, if you have any other specific topics that you would like 
to see addressed on this list, please post questions/thoughts about that 
topic to the list, or write me directly with your suggestions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

learners may be interested. -- Kim

>Hi All!
>
>I invite you to join us next week on the Focus on Basics list, for a
>discussion about ESOL learners who seem "stuck".
>
>When:   Wed, Feb. 15th - Wed, Feb 22nd
>Where:  On the Focus on Basics Discussion List (You can subcribe
>for     the week and then unsubscribe.) Go to:
>         www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/focusonbasics
>
>Who and What:
>Robin Schwarz, a longtime LD specialist, researcher and ESOL tutor,
>will
>discuss her  recent article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL
>Learners ", about ESOL learners who seem "stuck", and how we can find
>the real reasons for their struggles and find ways to get them back on
>track.
>
>You can find this article at:
>http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=994
>
>Following are some questions to think about as we prepare to discuss
>this article. If you have staff meetings coming up, I encourage you to
>use them as a chance to discuss the following questions as they relate
>to your center or program.
>
>Discussion Questions
>
>1.  Stories:  Have you had struggling learners in your program? How
>common do you think this problem is? Do you want to share a story of a
>learner you have worked with, and tell us how you were able to find out
>the issue, and what you did to help?
>
>2.  Physical Disabilities:  How do we screen for them and what
>specific
>accommodations can we make in the class or program for them?
>
>3.  Intake/Counseling Procedures:  What does your center or program do
>for a routine intake? What is the procedure to address a learner who is
>not progressing? How well do you get at factors such as physical and
>health problems, living situations, amount and nature of literacy
>skills, nature of the primary language and cultural communication
>style?
>
>4.  Responding: Once there is a reason discovered for a learner's
>struggles, how well-equipped are you to respond to the problem? How do
>you learn how to accommodate a hearing or visual problem? What do you do
>for the learner with anxiety or depression? Do you have access to a
>consulting teacher, or someone knowledgeable in the complexities of a
>given culture's communication style (as in the example of the
>Sudanesemen in the article)?
>
>5.  Staff Training/Professional Development: What kind of training do
>we all need in order to ensure that our intake procedures are complete
>and appropriate? What kind of  training will help us to respond an
>effective way?
>
>6.  Did This Article Change Something You Do? Share with us anything
>that you changed, did, started, or stopped as a result of reading this
>article.  Why?  What result did you get?
>
>7. What Connections Did You Make With This Article? Even if you did not
>change anything, did it ring a bell or hit home to you in some way?
>
>  We'll see you next week for the discussion!

>Discussion Questions
>
>1.  Stories:  Have you had struggling learners in your program? How

>not progressing? How well do you get at factors such as physical and
>health problems, living situations, amount and nature of literacy
>skills, nature of the primary language and cultural communication style?
>
>4.  Responding: Once there is a reason discovered for a learner's
>struggles, how well-equipped are you to respond to the problem? How do
>you learn how to accommodate a hearing or visual problem? What do you do
>for the learner with anxiety or depression? Do you have access to a
>consulting teacher, or someone knowledgeable in the complexities of a

Subject: [ProgramLeadership] New from NCSALL--Program Administrators'
	Sourcebook
Message-ID: <004201c63253$f1fc3570$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

If you administer an adult education program, you face a wide variety of challenges:

*         How can you help students make "level" gains?

*         How can you help students gain the skills they need to reach their goals?

*         How can you help students stay in programs long enough to meet their goals?

*         How can you prepare and retain good teachers?

*         How can you document the successes of your program?

 

The National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) conducted research relevant to these questions. The Program Administrators? Sourcebook (December 2005) is designed to give you, as a program administrator, direct access to research that may help you address the challenges you face in your job.

 

Written by Jackie Taylor, Cristine Smith, and Beth Bingman in collaboration with five local program administrators, this sourcebook presents NCSALL?s research findings in short sections related to key challenges that program administrators face in their work as managers of adult education programs. It also presents the implications of these research findings for program structure and services, as well as some strategies for implementing change based on these implications. 

 

To download the Program Administrators' Sourcebook, visit NCSALL's Web site: http://www.ncsall.net/?id=1035

 

To order the Program Administrators' Sourcebook at $10.00/copy, go to the NCSALL Order Form (http://www.ncsall.net/?id=674); limited quantities available.

>Colleagues,

The message below was originally posted on the Professional Development 
Discussion List by Connie Spencer-Ackerman.  With Connie's permission, I am 
cross-posting on this list.

In the posting, she describes the Leadership Institute for program 
directors that takes place in Kentucky.  Have any of you been involved in 
similar institutes in your state?  If so, was the focus on program 
directors?  What topic areas were included?

-- Kim


> >===== Original Message From Connie Spencer-Ackerman
><c.spencerack at morehead-st.edu> =====
>   I'd like to share what we have been doing in Kentucky to support
>professional development among our local program directors.
>
>For three years, a group of select program directors have been
>participating in what in called the Leadership Institute.  The
>Institute, which brings participants together three times a year,  is
>based on the Education Criteria for Performance Excellence, associated
>with the Baldrige National Quality Program. (a tip of the hat to Jim
>Ford at the Center for Literacy Studies for helping us select this
>framework).  During our times together, we revisit seven categories that
>high performing organizations should be focusing on --  leadership;
>strategic planning; student and stakeholder focus;  measurement,
>analysis, and knowledge management; faculty and staff focus; process
>management; and results -- and we discuss and share practices that
>assist program directors in these areas.
>
>New program directors are introduced to adult education in Kentucky with
>a series of three meetings organized and facilitated by our state office
>that focus on state policies as well as how the state supports local
>achievement of five goals established by the parent organization -- the
>Council on Postsecondary Education.  Then throughout the year the
>directors convene periodically to learn about topics that were
>identified by the previous year's cohort as being especially important.
>One session is dedicated to discussion of those characteristics of high
>performing programs identified in research conducted by Abt Associates.
>During the second year of their induction into adult education, program
>directors are exposed to principles of continuous improvement and a
>"lighter" version of the Baldrige criteria.  Because Kentucky's focus on
>program directors is relatively new, we do not yet have a fully
>developed curriculum for veteran program directors; but all new program
>director sessions described above are open to them.
>
>All program directors can find suitable professional development
>opportunities by searching by specialty area on PDtrack, our new
>professional development tracking system, which also allows them to
>register for workshops and to maintain a transcript of PD activity.
>Another feature of our new system is what are called "self-directed
>activities."  If a director wants to create his or her own professional
>development experience, in other words does not want to rely solely on
>national-, state- or Academy-sponsored events, he or she can submit to
>PDtrack a request to engage in a self-directed activity.   If you would
>like more information, go to http://www.kyae.ky.gov/pd/default.htm.
>There you will find a more detailed explanation as well as a copy of the
>professional development handbook which introduced the system.
>
>A particularly interesting feature of professional development
>introduced this past fall is the way value is assigned to professional
>development experiences.  Our intention was to value the depth of an
>experience rather than seat time.   Any experience that involves
>investigation of a topic (workshop, participation in a study circle,
>conference attendance, etc.) results in one professional development
>unit.  If the participant elects to apply and evaluate in his or her
>classroom or program that topic, an additional five units are earned.
>If the results of application and evaluations are shared with colleagues
>through a workshop, study circle, conference session, etc., three units
>are earned.  This is a rather simplified explanation, and we do not yet
>know what the results will be.

	Practitioner Knowledge
Message-ID: <001a01c63c8f$cf153020$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

Visit the new Practitioner Research, Practitioner Knowledge section of
NCSALL's Web site at http://www.ncsall.net/?id=967. Find out how
practitioners learn about new research and then inquire about how this
research might be used in their own practice. 

 

Teachers in the Northwest Practitioner Knowledge Institute learned about ESL
research, made a change in their own practice, documented what happened when
they made the change, and shared this knowledge in final reports. They
developed and documented "practitioner knowledge" developed from learning
about others' research. 

 

Teachers in the Minnesota Practitioner Research in Reading Project and the
Practitioner Dissemination and Research Network learned about others'
research and also conducted research of their own. After learning about new
research findings in reading or learner persistence, these teachers
developed a research question on one of these topics, planned an
intervention or change in their own practice, collected data on what
happened as a result, analyzed these data and reported their findings.

	Basics
Message-ID: <003b01c646cb$ef7cb270$0302a8c0@your4105e587b6>

"It's not an expensive journal, but has high quality articles with current
research and

techniques. . it helps me stay connected with the profession." says one
reader of Focus on Basics. 

 

The results of a survey on the impact of Focus on Basics on its readers is
available on the NCSALL Web site at http://www.ncsall.net/?id=29#27.  To
order a printed version ($10), go to http://www.ncsall.net/?id=681. (Printed
copies will be available by 3/17/06.)

 

SNEAK PREVIEW: The findings were overwhelmingly upbeat. The 292 readers who
completed the survey report that Focus on Basics has had a positive impact
in the following ways:

. It has influenced their beliefs about adult basic education.

. It has helped them feel connected to the larger education community as
professionals.

. It has contributed to the development of communities of practice.

. It has enabled them to make a connection between research and practice.

. It has provided them with concrete ideas they have used to change their
programs and practice.

 

Four in-depth interviews with professional development providers are
included as well.

 

Read the report to find out more about how the publication is and can be
used as a professional development tool.

Subject: [ProgramLeadership 39]  Stories of Program Improvement
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20060403180636.01639870@pop.utk.edu>

Dear List Subscribers:

A new page has been added to the Program Leadership and Improvement Special 
Collection web site http://pli.cls.utk.edu]. It's called "Stories of 
Program Improvement" and was developed as a response to what many of you 
have told us over the last couple of years - that you would like to hear 
about real experiences from real folks like yourself who have tried to 
improve their program at some level.

We started the page off with narratives from three of five participants who 
recently participated in a UPS Foundation-funded "Leadership for Community 
Literacy" Initiative.  After implementing a program improvement model based 
on the EFF Standards and Quality Program Practices, these participants 
wrote about their experiences - you can see their unedited stories at 
http://pli.cls.utk.edu/Stories/index.html.

Lori Hairrell, who headed up the effort by the Literacy Coalition of 
Chattanooga, will be a guest on the discussion list in a couple of 
weeks.  Details on her visit are forthcoming.

Two more stories from the UPS Foundation/EFF initiative will be added in a 
few weeks.  We would also like to add more stories - from you!  If you have 
done any kind of structured program improvement effort in your AE program, 
please consider contributing your story to this page. It can be two 
paragraphs, or a long narrative - I can even write it up if you want to 
just send notes or give me information.  Please consider doing this, and 
let me know if you're interested <kchaney at utk.edu>.

Sincerely,
Kim

Subject: [ProgramLeadership 40]  Curriculum Policy Proposals
Message-ID: <D7016867-F3C4-4878-9E69-E1051FE22FDE@comcast.net>

AAACE-NLA and Program Leadership Colleagues,

 From time to time government agencies at the federal and state level  
fund programs to develop curricula.  For example, for several years,  
through the U.S. Department of Education's Workplace Education  
Program, federal grants supported the development of workplace- 
specific or industry-specific basic skills (including ELL) curriculum  
for workers.  I think that it is useful for federal, state and local  
government agencies to fund curriculum development.  I wish they  
would fund more curriculum projects, both generic and industry- 
specific, in all areas of adult education and literacy (which  
includes ELL and numeracy.)

However, there are two things I would like to see government agencies  
require, that grantees:

1. Develop the curriculum against a set of curriculum standards or  
frameworks.  Given that we do not have federally-approved standards,  
national curriculum projects should use EFF standards, SCANS  
competencies, or possibly CASAS competencies, or a set of state- 
approved  curriculum frameworks. State and local curriculum projects  
could use state-approved curriculum standards.  Exceptions could be  
made for curriculum projects which use a participatory curriculum  
development model where a curriculum is developed from the  
interaction of a teacher and a particular group of students, growing  
from that particular group of students' needs.

2. Publish the curriculum in a government-sponsored curriculum  
database on the Web where anyone (especially teachers) could  quickly  
find it, using a set of adult education curriculum categories, and or  
search terms.

I have recently been searching for some specific workplace  
curriculum, and have been surprised to find how much time it takes to  
chase it down.  I am sure this curriculum exists; it is just not easy  
to find.  And when I have found it, it is rare that the curriculum  
was developed against a set of curriculum standards, or at least it  
isn't clear what the curriculum standards are.  I have often found  
that the curriculum is no longer in print.

Why do I bring this up here?  There are two reasons:

1) This is a public policy issue.  I would like to see the U.S.  
Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Labor, HUD, and other  
federal government agencies, and all state agencies which fund adult  
education and literacy curriculum development adopt this as a policy.  
It would add value to government-funded projects if others could  
benefit from the curriculum development work.  It would not cost much  
to create this web-based database or to maintain it.

2) I would like to hear your reactions to these proposals, for  
example from a program improvement (curriculum improvement is part of  
program leadership) and from a public policy perspective.

The following announcement is posted on behalf of Mary Ann Corley

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAVE the DATES: November 30-December 2, 2006!
ANNOUNCING: A MEETING OF THE MINDS II SYMPOSIUM!
The National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL), 
the California Department of Education (CDE) Adult Education Office, and 
the California Adult Literacy Professional Development Project (CALPRO) of 
the American Institutes for Research are pleased to announce a Meeting of 
the Minds II: A National Adult Education Practitioner-Researcher Symposium.
Scheduled for November 30-December 2, 2006, at the Sheraton Grand hotel in 
Sacramento, California, the symposium is designed to provide opportunities 
for adult education practitioners and researchers to share and discuss the 
most current research findings and practitioner wisdom. It will engage 
practitioners and researchers with questions related to goals, 
accountability, and efficacy and efficiency in policy, practice, and 
research. The ultimate goals of the symposium are to highlight systemic 
changes that can enhance literacy practice and increase student learning 
gains. The theme of this year's symposium is Systemic Change and Student 
Success: What Does Research Tell Us?
As in the first Meeting of the Minds Symposium that was held in 2004, each 
session of the 2006 Symposium will be structured so that the research 
presentation is followed by a panel of practitioners who will discuss 
implications for practice or policy. In addition, conference attendees will 
have opportunities for small group interaction and networking with 
researcher-presenters to discuss not only how research can inform practice 
and policy, but also how practice and policy can inform and suggest a 
research agenda.

More information about the Meeting of the Minds II symposium will be 
available soon on the symposium Web site, www.researchtopractice.org. (This 
Web site currently lists presenters' PowerPoints and abstracts of sessions 
held at the 2004 Meeting of the Minds symposium as well as thoughts 
generated by attendees regarding implications of the research findings.) We 
are in the process of updating this Web site to house information about 
online registration for the 2006 symposium as well as information about 
hotel registration. We will send out another notice after the Web site has 
been updated. In the meantime, please save the dates and plan to join us in 
November in Sacramento!

Thank you.

An Evidence-based Adult Education Program Model Appropriate for Research 

by John Comings, Lisa Soricone, and Maricel Santos 

The document reviews the available empirical evidence and professional
wisdom in order to define a program model that meets the requirements for
good practice. This program model describes what teachers, adult students,
counselors, administrators, volunteers, and program partners should do to
provide both effective instruction and the support services adults need to
persist in their learning long enough to be successful. This paper describes
a program model as having a program quality support component and three
chronological program components, which are entrance into a program,
participation in a program, and reengagement in learning. Though this model
could also be used as a description of good programs for other purposes,
here it describes the context in which research on approaches to instruction
and support services could be productive.

Learner's Engagement in Adult Literacy Education  

by Hal Beder, Jessica Tomkins, Patsy Medina, Regina Riccioni, and Weiling
Deng 

Engagement is mental effort focused on learning and is a precondition to
learning progress. It is important to understand how and why adult learners
engage in literacy instruction because engagement is a precondition to
learning progress. This study focused on how learning context shapes
engagement. The practical reason for doing so is that to a great extent
adult educators control the educational context. Thus if they understand how
the educational context shapes engagement, they can influence engagement in
positive ways.

Dear Colleagues:
Please join us in the following session at this year's COABE National
Conference in Houston, Texas:


Learning Disabilities & Work Issues: How Can We Help?

Thursday, April 27 at 11:00 AM in the computer lab
Presented by Aaron Kohring, Content Coordinator of the Literacy and 
Learning Disabilities Special Collection
and Donna Brian, Content Coordinator of the Workforce Education Special 
Collection


Learning disabilities among workers are common, though often unrecognized, 
and they frequently contribute to job loss. As an educator, what can you do 
to prepare adults with LD for greater success in the world of work? How do 
you assist an adult to self-assess for their strengths, their struggles, 
and helpful accommodations? What proactive steps can make the difference 
between success and frustration for LD workers? What is the role of 
self-advocacy? Are there learning strategies that are especially effective 
with LD workers? Where can you go for resources?

This session begins with a participatory activity to heighten awareness of 
the nature of LD in the workplace. Participants will then consider ways to 
discern strengths and weaknesses of an adult with learning disabilities and 
provide appropriate accommodations to foster success. Learning and work 
strategies particularly effective for those with LD will be introduced. The 
recounted experiences of successful LD workers will bring to life the 
critical role that self-advocacy plays.

Throughout the presentation, the presenters will highlight pertinent 
resources from the Literacy and Learning Disabilities and Workforce 
Education Special Collections. We will demonstrate on-line how the 
collections can be used to find free resources. The organization and 
content of the special collections will be explored through using the 
collections to find information about issues. Attendees will be able to 
extend their learning beyond the presentation through access to a 
self-paced tutorial (authored by the presenters) plus a list of applicable 
online resources.

Participation of attendees in providing examples of their experiences with 
adults with LD will be encouraged throughout the presentation. Discussion 
will invite feedback from participants to guide the presenters' continued 
future efforts in collecting and organizing on-line resources responsive to 
the needs of workplace and workforce educators in mentoring adults with 
learning disabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Colleague,
We need your opinion and your vote. Literacy President 2008 is a non-
partisan effort to increase national awareness of adult literacy
regardless of whom is elected. Literacy President provides members
of the adult education community with ways to be active participants
in the 2008 Presidential election. The first activity was generating
possible questions to ask the candidates. We now have 20 possible
questions, and they need to be narrowed to the top five.
This is your chance to vote on these, to help us narrow them to the
top five best questions. In the 2004 election, Literacy President
had over 1000 people -- practitioners, adult learners and others --
who voted for the top priority questions. This time our goal is 1500
people participating: students, practitioners and other advocates for
adult literacy.
To vote, please go to

I'm wondering if it is at all possible for multiple postings to be sent to 
the lists as one message rather than as separate messages.  I ask this 
because I am a member of 12 of the 13 listservs and every time there is a 
multiple message, I receive it 12 times.  As you can imagine this fills up 
my inbox quite a bit.  It is rather easy to do by creating a group listing 
in your address book (like I've done with this message).

I am sure that there are other listserv participants who are members of 
multiple lists as well who would appreciate this consideration.  Thank 
you.

Hi, Lauren.

I appreciate this question - I am also on several NIFL discussion lists, as 
well as a couple of other state lists, and have had the same 
experience.  In terms of the technology, at this time there is no way to 
prevent this from happening. Most people do not belong to all the NIFL 
listservs, so when there is an announcement that has to be made regarding 
adult literacy, NIFL wants as many people as possible to get it, so the 
announcement is sent out to all NIFL listservs.

The strategy that I take is to use the digest format.  It has really cut 
down the number of incoming email messages I receive.  The way to do that 
is as follows:

- Go into your user-settings and change from non-digest to digest format.
This way you will receive posts in groups rather than receiving a post
everytime someone posts to the list (for instructions on how to go to your
user-settings page, please go to
http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/help/help_mailman.html#settings)


Another option that some subscribers follow is to read the subject line. If 
it is about an announcement that one has already read,  delete it before 
even opening it up.   The moderators will continue to work diligently at 
asking folks to use accurate subject lines.

Please know that NIFL is taking this request seriously and is trying to 
figure out if there is anything that can be done about it.  In the 
meantime, I hope these suggestions help.

Regards,
Kim

Dear Colleagues on the PLI Discussion List:

Literacy President 2008 is a non-partisan effort to get adult education 
issues before candidates to make our interests and concerns a part of the 
dialogue of the presidential campaign, as it develops. You were asked 
earlier on this list to submit possible questions, and now you are being 
asked to select among the submitted questions on the basis of which would 
be the most important to ask the candidates.

See the forwarded e-mails from David Rosen [below] to find out how to vote.

Yours,
Kim

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Colleague,
The nonpartisan Literacy President survey is off to a good start. We
now have over 325 people who have voted on the questions to ask the
candidates for President. The top state, way in the lead, is
Pennsylvania, with over 68 votes on the questions. Next is
California with 28, Illinois with 15, then Florida, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, and New Jersey. Other states also have a few
participants who have voted.
We have a way to go to reach our goal of 1500 survey participants.
And currently only one student has voted, so we need to do a lot more
to get students involved.
If you haven't voted yet, please do. To vote, please go to:

Even if you have voted, please help to get the message out to others.
Post the message below to adult literacy education electronic lists
of your organization or state. Voting will take place over the next
several weeks, but it's important to get the word out as soon as
possible.

Thanks for your help.

I am pleased to announce that Esmerelda Doreste, Program Director with the 
Union City (NJ) Adult Learning Center, will be a guest on the list from

improvement process based on the EFF program quality model.

Along with the four other participants, Ms. Doreste wrote about that 
experience...her story is now accessible on the "Program Leadership and 
Improvement" web site.  Go to [http://pli.cls.utk.edu] and click the 
"Stories of Program Improvement" button, then click/open "Union City Adult 
Learning Center: A Program Improvement Process."

of implementing the process, as well as any other related issues.

Looking forward to next week,
Kim

Dear Colleagues,

We are happy to announce that the National Institute for Literacy has launched a new web page design to help provide easily accessible, high quality information about literacy. New features clearly highlight the Institute's work in all areas of literacy, including early childhood, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. You will continue to find the links to all of the Institute's projects, such as Bridges to Practice, LINCS, Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles under Programs and Services. The Institute's publications, including the recently released Teaching Reading to Adults can be found under the Publications link. Please visit http://www.nifl.gov for more information.

This is phase one of the redesign. We will soon be incorporating all the Institute's projects into this new design.  As many of you know, websites are always a work in progress and we intend to continue improving the Institute's site in order to provide you with the best available resources.	

We would love to hear your thoughts regarding the new look. Please send your comments to Jo Maralit at mmaralit at nifl.gov.   

Thanks,

Sandra Baxter, Ed.D.

The following message is posted at the request of Barb Garner, Editor of 
"Focus on Basics":

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The newest Focus On Basics, on learners' Experiences, is now available on 
NCSALL's web site, www.ncsall.net.
Quick, tell me about your students' self esteem. Low, because of their 
academic struggles? That's not what a recent NCSALL-Rutgers study showed.

And how about reading? Do your learners know that to increase their reading 
fluency, they need to...read? What kind of and how much reading do they do 
outside of class? Another NCSALL-Rutgers study follows three learners as 
they go about their days and finds quite a variety in the amount of reading 
the learners do on their own.

Teachers, have you ever seen yourself teach? Or noticed just what that 
clump of students was doing while you were engaged with one person on 
another side of the classroom? Teachers working with NCSALL-Rutgers found 
that videos taken of their classroom for research purposes provided them 
with rich information useful to their own professional development. Learn 
how useful video can be in helping pinpoint issues and suggest new ways of 
doing things in the classroom.

There's lots more, particularly around learner engagement.
Go to www.ncsall.net and click on "Newest Issue of Focus on Basics"
Printed copies and a text-only web version will not be out for another two 
weeks.

Regards,
Barb Garner, Editor

Subject: [ProgramLeadership 54]  Shared plan time for teachers
Message-ID: <44706C5F@webmail.utk.edu>

Hello Esmerelda,
Thank you for joining us to share your experiences with program improvement. I 
have a few questions for you pertaining to how you structured your program 
such that your teachers had (still have?) shared planning time once a week. 
Would you tell us more about how you made that work?

For example:
1) Are your teachers primarily part time? At the same location? Different 
locations?
2) What was their initial response to this change in their schedules?
3) Were they paid to participate in shared plan time? If so, then was this 
financially supported as a part of the EFF/UPS project, or have they 
traditionally been receiving paid plan time?
4) What was their assessment of having this shared plan time? Did they find it 
beneficial to the program improvement process? For their own professional 
well-being?
5) Do they still have shared plan time now that the EFF/UPS project is over?
6) What recommendations do you have for program directors who are considering 
a change in teacher scheduling to include shared plan time?

Thanks for your thoughts, Jackie

Hello Jackie,
At the Adult Learning Center the teachers are full time and still have
shared planning time on Friday afternoons at 400 38th street. They are
under union contract and must receive a certain number of preps per week
and all I did was change their schedule to have a common planning
period. The teachers' initial response was positive because they liked
the idea of a common prep on Fridays. In the evening program at 318 -
18th street all teachers get paid for 1/2 hour common planning time /
student counseling as well in which teachers can discuss individual
student needs and assist students via appointments for life/career
skills. In the evening program the staff was pleased because it gave
them time to plan together. Both programs are covered by grant money
that did not involve the UPS/EFF funding. Using the EFF process of
program improvement gave me the ideas to allow my staff to work
collaboratively. The teachers handed in a questionnaire without having
to put their names on it to share their opinions about the changes in
the program and luckily they were all positive and they found it
beneficial to the program improvement process as well as their own
professional 
well-being. I did use the EFF/UPS funding to pay interested staff
members to rewrite our outdated curriculum based on the EFF standards.

My recommendation for program directors who are considering 
a change in teacher scheduling to include shared plan time is try your
best to do it. I realized that when we encourage teachers to share ideas
great things happen.

Sincerely,
esmeralda

Dear Esmerelda,

In reading your story of the program improvement process at the Union City 
Adult Learning Center, I have a couple of questions to ask....

(1) The first question regards the Advisory Board that were put together to 
aid in this process.  How often did the Advisory Board meet?  Was it 
monthly?  If so, for how many months?  Was there a smaller "core" group 
that met to spend more time on certain parts of the program improvement 
process (in addition to the teachers' weekly planning times)?

(2) The second question regards student input.  You noted that students 
gave input to Ms. Gabriella Ruiz, the Student Representative on the 
board...could you describe that process a bit more (ie, did she interview 
students, did students come to her voluntarily with feedback, etc.)?

Thank you,
Kim Chaney-Bay

the Advisory Board and Student Input posted on Friday.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Advisory Board met monthly and the core group met every Friday to
spend more time on certain parts of the program improvement
process. In addition to the teachers' weekly planning times I attached
some notes from our meetings so you can get idea of who was involved and
what we accomplished.

Ms. Gabriella Ruiz, the Student Representative on the
board, came in on Fridays to interview students with questions about
school improvement that came to her voluntarily with feedback. We were
able to create a school DVD with student testimonials thanks to Mrs.
Ruiz and all her input.

Sincerely,

Subject: New PLI List Moderator


Hello everyone.
I am Peggy McGuire, and as of  June 1, 2006, I have taken on the role of Moderator of this Program Leadership and Improvement discussion list. 
 
As my very first activity in this new role, I want to send heartfelt thanks to Kim Chaney-Bey for her service as (now former) PLI list moderator. I think she did an admirable job of it, I greatly enjoyed working with her when we had opportunities to do so, and I look forward to future collaboration as she continues to oversee the NIFL Program Leadership and Improvement Special Collection. Well done, Kim!
 
Next I want to say just a couple things about why I am grateful for and excited about the opportunity to moderate this list (those of you who know me have probably already heard this, so please bear with me!). In 1984 I joined a group of community folk in starting a small community-based adult literacy project for women in my Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia. From that time through 1998, I served as Literacy/ABE/GED teacher, program coordinator and finally Executive Director of the project. One of the many things I learned from that experience was the great promise, as well as the considerable challenges, inherent in the role of program administrator in such setttings. I came to believe that program administrators were in an ideal position -- on ground between real-world practice on the one hand and policy and accountability matters on the other -- to see the "big picture" goals of the important work we do, and to be sure that program decisions and actions always take them into account. I also became aware of how hard that is to accomplish, and how few resources program administrators had for technical assistance and support that might help them keep this big picture clearly at the center of their efforts. So as I began to work with the fine folks at the Center for Literacy Studies in 1999, primarily on initiatives related to Equipped for the Future, I looked for opportunities to develop resources for program leaders as part of my work. I have been very fortunate over the past years in being able to pursue some of those opportunities. 
 
And here I am -- but enough about me!
 
I would like to ask list members to help me to get to know who you are, and what you care about, so I can do the best possible job of moderating this forum ( which I hope serves as one such resource for asssistance and support for program leaders). As a way in to this process, I would love it if you all could take a little time to reflect on this notion of "Program Leader". From your own experience and perspective in whatever role you play within your organization, what does it mean to be a "program leader"? What does a program leader do? What are the opportunities a program leader can, and ought to, pursue? And what are the challenges a program leader faces when trying to pursue these? Then if you will, share your reflections with the list. And we'll go from there!
 
So many thanks for this new adventure, and all the best!

Subject: [Assessment 346] FW: [AAACE-NLA] Results of Literacy PresidentQuestions Survey



Dear Colleagues,

The following post/update is from David Rosen.
marie cora
Assessment Discussion List Moderator
_____________


AAACE-NLA Colleagues,

The Literacy President survey was conducted in April and May, 2006. 
Participants selected their top eight questions from an online survey 
of twenty possible questions to ask the candidates for President in 
2008.  The questions from the survey came primarily from 
practitioners, in response to a series of requests on the AAACE-
National literacy Advocacy electronic list, and also from questions 
on the 2004 Literacy President survey.

1666 people responded.

. Practitioners: 82.7%
. Learners (e.g. adult new reader, adult education program graduate) 
6.3%
. College or university students in adult education: 3.8%
. Other: 10.8%

. Female: 82.2%

The top 12 participating states in order of the most participants, were:

1. Pennsylvania:   193
2. Tennessee: 142
3. Washington: 140
4. Massachusetts: 104
5. Kansas: 99
6. Illinois: 97
7. California: 95
8. Ohio: 80
9. Georgia: 65
10. Virgnia: 61
11. New Jersey: 52
12. Minnesota: 49

Taking into account both the number of people who selected a given 
question and its assigned priority it was difficult to determine the 
top five questions.  Instead, I have listed the top seven questions. 
Note that questions 6 and 7 were close in number of votes  and that 
they had a higher percentage of people choosing them in their top 
three priorities.

Top Seven Questions

The Working Poor.

1. In 2000, 6.4 million American adults were classified as the 
"working poor." The majority -three-fifths- worked full-time but 
remained in poverty. To make a "living wage" many of these adults 
require further education and training. For many, the lack of a high 
school diploma and strong literacy skills is a barrier to the 
training needed to obtain a job with a living wage. What will you do 
to address this issue?

Total respondents who chose this:                         790
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     43%

2. Priority of Adult Education

As President, will you make adult education and literacy one of your 
top three educational priorities?

Total respondents who chose this:                         710
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     74%

3. Professional Development and Support for Teachers

Given the importance of adult literacy education and its impact on 
the workforce, what will you do to ensure sufficient training, 
salaries, and benefits for adult basic education teachers?

Total respondents who chose this:                         683
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     32%

4. Competitiveness in a World Economy

A recent government survey indicates that 93 million individuals are 
at risk at home, at work and in the community because of low levels 
of literacy. What new investment in adult education will you make to 
increase access for the unemployed, new immigrants and other at risk 
populations in order to keep our nation competitive?

Total respondents who chose this:                         673
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     51%

5. Adults Left Behind

What role should the federal government take in providing services 
for adults and out-of-school youth who have been "left behind" by the 
educational system in their states?

Total respondents who chose this:                         652
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     41%

6. Intergenerational Literacy

Children who do not get an education now will become adults who need 
literacy skills. Then, as parents, they are unable help their 
children with schoolwork. Without strong parental support for 
education, children of these individuals may also be left behind. 
What do you see as the role of adult education programs in addressing 
this intergenerational literacy issue?

Total respondents who chose this:                         645
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     44%

7. Funding

Do you believe that Adult Education and Literacy services (including 
English language learning and family literacy) should be available to 
all residents who need and seek those services? If so, are you 
willing to support an increase in funding that would eliminate long 
waiting lists for these services?

Total respondents who chose this:                         641
%age which chose this as one of top 3 priorities:     46%


Comments from participants:

There were 135 participants who chose to comment on the questionnaire 
or its process:

. Twenty two said they thought the questions were good, that it was 
hard to choose, that all the questions are important, that all should 
be asked.

. Nine said the survey was hard to complete, cumbersome, complicated, 
time-consuming, difficult mechanically.

. Nine said we shouldn't ask yes/no questions.  One said we shouldn't 
ask open-ended questions.

. Three said the questions should be shorter.

. Three objected to the wording of some of the questions, which 
appeared to them to include illegal immigrants.

. Two said the questionnaire was too hard for some students.

The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) and the National Center for the
Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) announce the "Adult Reading
Components Study (ARCS) Panel," a 30-minute video on NCSALL's ARCS research
produced by the Institute.  This video is available in streaming format and
can be viewed by going to:

 

http://www.nifl.gov/nifl/webcasts/20040204/webcast02-04.html 

 

ARCS was the first large-scale attempt to use a battery of individually
administered reading and language tests to describe the reading of students
enrolled in adult basic education (ABE) and English for speakers of other
languages (ESOL) programs. Nearly 1,000 adult learners from 30 learning
centers in seven states were assessed in order to develop instructionally
relevant cluster profiles of adult readers. 

 

The video offers a panel discussion about NCSALL's ARCS research and ways in
which programs can use the Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles, an
on-line assessment tool based on the ARCS research, to assess students and
plan instruction tailored to their specific profiles. Panel participants
are:

 

Dr. John Strucker - Researcher and ARCS Director, NCSALL

Dr. Rosalind Davidson - Researcher and ARCS Assistant Director, NCSALL

Kay Vaccaro - Program Assistant, Harris County, TX Department of Education,
Adult Education Division

Jane Meyer - Coordinator, ABLE-funded adult literacy project, Canton, OH

David J. Rosen (moderator) - Senior Associate, Newsome Associates, Boston,
MA

 

To visit the Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles ARCS Web site,
please go to: http://www.nifl.gov/readingprofiles/

To learn more about the ARCS, please see NCSALL's "Seminar Guide - Reading
Profiles" http://www.ncsall.net/?id=597 available from the CPPR section of
the NCSALL Web site. 

A NCSALL study circle guide on reading research and teaching materials on
reading are available from the Publications section of the NCSALL Web site:
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=25

The ARCS video panel introduction is also available free on DVD:

Order from NCSALL at http://www.ncsall.net/?id=24 for $5.00/copy (shipping
and handling), or send your request to NIFL at info at nifl.gov, and be sure to
include your mailing address.

 

The ARCS video is the first in a series of videos based on NCSALL research
that are being produced by the National Institute for Literacy.   As each
video is completed, streaming versions will be posted to the Web, with
accompanying announcements on the Institute's listservs and web sites and
NCSALL's Web site. Once the entire series is completed, all of the videos
will be packaged in a single DVD, which the Institute and NCSALL will make
available to the field.  The National Institute for Literacy and NCSALL
present these videos as introductions to key research topics in adult
learning and literacy.  We hope the field finds them useful as professional
and program development tools.

Hi everyone,
 
If you see fit, please forward to your Lists.  Thanks, marie
 
 
 
To subscribe to this discussion, go to:  http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Assessment
 
Dear Colleagues,  
 
I hope this email finds you well.
 
I'm pleased to announce the following Guest Discussion, which will begin on Monday of next week:
 
June 19 - 23, 2006
 
Topic:  Assessment in Mathematics 
 
Guest:  Myrna Manly - please see Myrna's bio below.
 
Myrna will respond to your email posts once per day - feel free to send your post to the Assessment Discussion List, or to me so that I can post it for you (marie.cora at hotspurpartners.com).
 
Bio
Myrna Manly, a mathematics teacher with experience at many academic levels, retired in 2001 from a position as professor of mathematics at El Camino College.  In addition to instruction, she has been involved with the assessment of the mathematics proficiency of adults in various roles: as the Mathematics Specialist for the 1988 version of the GED test; as a member of the numeracy team for the Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (ALL); and as the numeracy consultant for a similar international survey to be used in developing countries, the Literacy Assessment and Monitoring Programme (LAMP). She is the Past President of the Adult Numeracy Network (ANN), is the author of The GED Math Problem Solver, and also works with states and programs facilitating staff-development workshops aimed at improving mathematics instruction to adults. 
 
Myrna is presently writing a paper with Mary Jane Schmidt and Lynda Ginsburg on the components of numeracy for NCSALL (National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy). The paper reviews the literature, describes the fundamental elements of adult numeracy, and makes recommendations for further research, particularly with respect to curriculum and assessment.  Look for this resource soon from NCSALL.
 
Recommended preparations for this discussion
 
Myrna has provided several questions below to get you thinking about math assessment:
 
*	It is known that students and teachers come to value what is assessed.  What is your opinion of the influence that the standardized mathematics assessments (GED, TABE, CASAS) have in your classrooms? Are they assessing the mathematics that is important for the 21st century? Do you think that they all assess the same mathematics? What do you think is missing from each? 
 
*	Computation skills are easy to assess.  How can we assess other important aspects of mathematics like strategic problem solving, conceptual understanding, and reasoning? 
 
*	Describe instances where you have seen a student's "math anxiety" interfere with an accurate assessment of his/her abilities. Do you assess math anxiety in any way? What strategies have you used to reduce it? Any luck with them? 
 
*	Which classroom techniques do you recommend for informal, ongoing assessment of a student's progress in learning mathematics? 
 
In addition to the above questions to stimulate discussion, Myrna has provided these sites for math assessment.  Please take a look at these sites and post your questions and comments to the Discussion:

http://www.literacy.org/products/ncal/pdf/TR9805.pdf  Assessing Mathematical Knowledge of Adult Learners: Are We Looking at What Counts? This technical report from NCAL was written by Joy Cumming, Iddo Gal, and Lynda Ginsburg in 1998.  It discusses assessment principles and evaluates their implementation in common numeracy assessment tools.
 
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=573 The Inclusion of Numeracy in Adult Basic Education, Dave Tout and Mary Jane Schmitt, 2002.  This chapter from NCSALL's annual review contains a section on assessment that includes a description of assessments in adult education from Australia and The Netherlands. 
 
http://www.nctm.org/news/assessment/2005_12nb.htm Will This Be on the Test? This article discusses the importance of including significant mathematics on tests.  It includes a good example of a test item that goes beyond procedural skills.

Hi everyone!
 
I am forwarding the announcement below on behalf of Julie McKinney, moderator of the NIFL-Health Literacy discussion list.
 
And just a note about such messages that I will be forwarding: I know that folks get a lot of email, and sometimes multiple copies of the same message, so I am going to try to be as judicious as possible in choosing to forward messages that I receive. The challenge, from my perspective, is that "program leadership and improvement" encompasses so many topics that are of importance to program leaders -- how we recruit and retain students, how we plan and implement curriculum, instruction and assessment, how we insure quality opportunities for professional development, how we manage program accountability at multiple levels, etc., etc... So how to choose what to pass on, or not? I would warmly welcome any guidance that PLI list subscribers might be moved to offer!
 
Meanwhile, I hope you find Julie's post useful!
 
**********************************************************
I am happy to announce a discussion next week on the Health Literacy
list. We will be
talking about the Health Literacy Study Circles+, a series of
facilitator guides published by NCSALL, which introduces teachers to a
skills-based approach
to Health Literacy.

Our guest speakers will be Winston Lawrence, senior professional
development associate with the Literacy Assistance Center in New York
City, and Lisa Soricone, a research associate and former fellow at the
National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL).

Together they piloted these study circles with adult learners in New
York City, and wrote about their experience through an interview in
"Focus on Basics" (FOB). Please see this article for more information
about the study circles, and to prepare for this discussion:

A Conversation with FOB: Learning How to Teach Health Literacy
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=995

We look forward to our first formal discussion on the Health Literacy
List! Please pass on this information to any colleagues who may be
interested, they can join the list (and then unsubscribe afterwards if
they wish) at the following link:

	Staff
Message-ID: <20060628154255.1CB3046555@dev.nifl.gov>

Hello everyone,

My name is My Linh Nguyen, and I am the new Associated Director of
Communications for the National Institute for Literacy. I would like to take
this opportunity to introduce myself along with three other new hires at the
Institute. The press release below introduces each of the four new hires and
identifies our roles and backgrounds. Thank you, and I look forward to
working with all of you. 


       National Institute for Literacy Appoints New Staff

The National Institute for Literacy has appointed four new staff members to
expand its capacity to contribute to improvements in adult, adolescent,
childhood and early childhood literacy.  

Andrea Grimaldi has joined the Institute as Senior Project Officer
in Early Childhood Literacy. She will be responsible for planning and
managing the Institute's work on early childhood literacy. She will also
oversee dissemination of the National Early Literacy Panel Report, expected
to be released in late 2006. 

My Linh Nguyen has joined the Institute as Associate Director of
Communications. In this capacity, she will plan and manage communications
activities designed raise awareness of literacy issues and the Institute's
products and services. 

The two other new staffers will join the Institute in July. Susan
Boorse, who will serve as Executive Officer, will have responsibility for
budgetary and financial management activities as well as administrative
functions. Heather Wright has been selected to serve as Dissemination
Specialist. In this capacity, she will plan and oversee implementation of
the Institute's print and electronic products to ensure that they are widely
and easily available.

"The arrival of these four individuals signals an exciting new era for the
National Institute for Literacy," said Dr. Sandra Baxter, the Institute's
Director. "Each of them brings fresh ideas and new perspectives along with
their diverse backgrounds and expertise. Their presence will reenergize our
existing programs and help us carry out new efforts to better serve the
adult and childhood literacy communities."

All four new appointees have a wide variety of experience in their
fields.

Ms. Grimaldi has more than a decade of experience as an early
childhood education teacher, program manager, and trainer. Most recently,
she served as the training manager for professional development with the
Public Broadcasting Service's (PBS) five-year Ready To Learn Initiative to
prepare young children for success in school through educational television,
web-based media and training for parents and teachers.

Ms. Nguyen comes to the Institute from the Delaware River Port
Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where she served as manager of
corporate communications and public information officer. She is a former
general assignment reporter and copy editor for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Ms. Boorse served in the Peace Corps for eight years as an
administrative and budget officer. She also served four years as a VISTA
volunteer, working with a literacy program in Philadelphia, a rural school
district in Mississippi, and a fledgling Philadelphia Habitat for Humanity
affiliate. 

Ms. Wright comes to the Institute from the Montgomery County
Department of Public Libraries in Maryland, where, as Children's Librarian,
she was involved in early literacy programs for babies, toddlers,
preschoolers and elementary-school children. Her previous professional
background is in the field of marketing research, where she conducted many
research studies to measure the needs of customers and target markets, both
in the library setting and in the private sector. 
	
The National Institute for Literacy provides leadership on literacy
issues, including the improvement of reading instruction for children,
youth, and adults. In consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education,
Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Institute serves as a national
resource on current, comprehensive literacy research, practice, and policy.

Study Circle Guide: Adult Student Persistence

 

Newly revised to include the second phase of the NCSALL research on adult
student persistence, this guide provides comprehensive instructions for
facilitating a 10?-hour study circle. It explores what the research says
about adult student persistence and ideas for how to apply what is learned
in classrooms and programs. The guide is based on a review of the NCSALL
research on adult student persistence conducted by John Comings and others,
summarized in an article entitled ?Supporting the Persistence of Adult Basic
Education Students? and other studies on student motivation and retention.
It includes articles, resources, and action research reports to help
practitioners consider strategies for increasing adult student persistence.
This guide provides all the necessary materials and clear instructions to
plan and facilitate a three-session study circle with an option for a
fourth. Each session lasts three-and-a-half hours.

Hi. If you have not done so already, I suggest looking at the Learner
Persistence section of the ALE wiki. 

 

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Learner_Persistence

 

In particular, you may want to take a look at a discussion of managed
enrollment from the LPRP Connections archives.

Hello all,

I am investigating the topic of managed enrollment for the Massachusetts
DOE, and I am hoping that some of you will be interested in sharing:

1. Your perception of managed enrollment; 

2.  Your experience with managed enrollment practice and policy;

3.  Your thoughts on the pros and cons of managed enrollment;

4.  Your thoughts on how managed enrollment affects the retention,
persistence, and learning gains of students;

5.  Which contexts are suited for managed enrollment, and which aren't?

I am also posting to the Special topics list regarding these questions,
so I apologize for double posts you may receive.  

I very much look forward to your comment!

Sincerely,

Alisa Vlahakis Povenmire, ABE Consultant, former SABES Coordinator

Message-ID: <6A5CE13D731DE249BC61CB8C5C474B0A04B36EBC@UTKFSVS1.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi everyone!

The following announcement comes from Marie Cora, moderator of the NIFL-Assessment discussion list, and may be of special interest to those of you who need to pay attention to NRS reporting for your programs.Enjoy!

Good morning, afternoon, and evening to you all.  I hope this email finds you well.

 

I wanted to let everyone know that during this week, Larry Condelli from AIR (American Institutes of Research), who works with the NRS, and Sarah Young, from CAL (Center for Applied Linguistics) who works with BEST Plus will be available to answer any questions you might have regarding the changes in ESOL Level Descriptors, which go into effect this summer (this month I believe).  I also encourage anyone who has questions regarding other ESOL tests (CASAS or EFF for example) to join in this Q&A.  Because the Level Descriptors have been adjusted, the tests used to track learning gains also have undergone some shifting and it is important that we understand what these changes are.  

 

Larry and Sarah will be present on the List during this week, but perhaps intermittently - replies may not come immediately.  I encourage you to post your question to the List, or to send your question to me for posting, if you prefer that.  

 

Larry, Sarah, and others working with any of the ESOL tests - feel free to jump in and give us a thumbnail sketch of what the changes are and how they might affect our work in programs and with students.

 

The NRS homepage is located at:  http://www.nrsweb.org/ <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.nrsweb.org/> 

To view information on the NRS Level Descriptors, please go to:  http://www.nrsweb.org/reports/NewESLdescriptors.pdf <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.nrsweb.org/reports/NewESLdescriptors.pdf> 

At the bottom of the NRS homepage, see also:  NRS Changes for Program Year 2006

 

Thanks so much - I'm looking forward to understanding this information, and hearing what folks questions are regarding the changes

Colleagues,
 
Next week, Monday July 24 - Friday July 28, we are privileged to have ,  as a guest on the Workplace Literacy Discussion List ,  Alison Campbell of the Conference Board of Canada. Many of you already know of her work, but for those of you who don't, she has 3 websites that I consider sister sites of the Workforce Education site. Where our Workforce site is geared more toward adult education instructors with a workforce focus, her sites are geared more toward business and industry employers who want and/or need to upgrade their workers' literacy skills. The Conference Board is also responsible for quite a lot of good research which Alison has been a part of.

Bio

Alison Campbell


       

Alison Campbell is a Senior Research Associate with the Education and Learning practice at The Conference Board of Canada. She acts as lead researcher, author and web site manager on various research projects in the area of workplace education and learning. This year, Alison is also managing the Conference Board's International Workplace Education and Learning Conference: Sharing Global Solutions (Toronto, December 5-6, 2006).

 

In 2005, Alison authored Profiting from Literacy: Creating a Sustainable Workplace Literacy Program and co-authored Literacy, Life and Employment: An Analysis of Canadian International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) Microdata. In 2003, Alison authored Strength from Within: Overcoming the Barriers to Workplace Literacy Development as part of a national research study on the challenges employers face in designing and implementing workplace literacy and basic skills programs. In 2002, she co-managed a national study in the U.S. on the impacts of joint labor-management education programs. She co-authored the final report: Success by Design: What Works in Workforce Development. Alison currently manages a pilot project on the benefits of a national credit review service to improve credentialing opportunities for workplace education. 

 

Her work on workplace literacy and basic skills development extends beyond Canada to the United States. Alison manages and makes updates to www.work-basedlearning.org, www.scorecardforskills.com and www.workplacebasicskills.com - a suite of web sites funded by the U.S. Department of Education that act as free resources to American employers and their partners who wish to improve employees' skills.

 

 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

As you can tell from her bio, Alison has expertise in many areas of workplace literacy.  Attached to this message is a complete listing of her publications and presentations, which are available for free download on the Conference Board site.  You must, however, register with the site to access them. (Sign in at http://www.conferenceboard.ca/boardwiseii/Signin.asp <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/boardwiseii/Signin.asp>  and when you have the option, browse documents by "author" choosing "Campbell, Alison.")  Access to the web sites does not require registration, and they are linked in her bio above. Alison is willing to discuss with us any of the areas of workplace literacy on her web sites or in her publications. It should be a wide-ranging discussion!  I hope you will be able to participate!

what they know about it.

Thank you,

Subject: [ProgramLeadership 78] Another great upcoming event -- this time on
	the NIFL-AdultEL discussion list
Message-ID: <6A5CE13D731DE249BC61CB8C5C474B0A04B36EC5@UTKFSVS1.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hello again all!

I am posting this announcement on behalf of Lynda Terrill concerning a matter that may be of great interest to those of us working with English Language Learners. Enjoy!

 

 

Dear colleagues,


I am happy to announce an upcoming panel discussion on the adult English language list on working with literacy-level adult English language learners.  The discussion will be the week of August 7-11, with further questions, comments, and information-sharing welcome after that. 

 

[to subscribe to the English language list, go to http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Englishlanguage <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Englishlanguage> ]

 

Background Information  

Some teachers-especially those new to teaching adult English language learners-express concern about teaching learners who aren't literate in their native language or never went to school. In many ways, this concern is unwarranted. Having or not having had access to formal education does not correlate to cognitive functioning, interest, and energy. Most literacy-level learners will need explicit instruction in basic literacy skills (e.g., phonological  processing, vocabulary development, syntactical processing). However, these learners bring an array of lifeskills knowledge (often including some oral proficiency and knowledge of American culture) problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm to the process.   

 

Still, teachers and administrators sometimes feel challenged by questions such as:

 

*	Who are the literacy-level adult ESL learners? 
*	What skills do literacy-level learners need to develop? 
*	How can programs and administrators effectively support literacy-level adult English language learners and their teachers? 
*	What are effective instructional practices in the literacy class? 
*	What are effective needs assessment activities for literacy-level adult English language learners? 
*	What other approaches and activities are effective with literacy-level learners? 
*	What resource are helpful for teachers? 
*	What instructional materials are effective for literacy-level learners-to help them acquire skills they need to reach their personal goals? 

Process of the Discussion

To address these and other questions, nine adult ESL and refugee content experts have graciously accepted my invitation to answer questions and share ideas on the topic of literacy-level learners in adult ESL. Within this group are teachers, program administrators, cultural orientation specialists, curriculum designers, assessment experts, and authors of teacher resources and literacy-level materials for learners.  Members of the panel have worked extensively as volunteers, teachers, and administrators, in learning labs and online, in general ESL, workplace and work readiness programs, transition programs, family literacy, refugee programs, in the United States and overseas from Mongolia to (the then) Zaire.  I started adding up the panelists' years of  experience, but stopped when it topped 100 years. 

 

To organize this discussion with so many panelists, I will offer a short biography of each panelist, which includes their areas of particular expertise-although each panelist is knowledgeable in many areas related to adult ESL, refugees, and  immigration.  

 

In this way, you can direct a question or comment to a specific panelist (e.g., a question about literacy-level learners in family literacy would be directed to the family literacy expert).  However, all panelists, as well as the very many of you on the list who are also experts, please jump in at any time. 

 

I will post the nine biographies next week, a few days before the panel begins.

 

The panelists will be:

Guest Discussion: Poverty, Race, & Literacy 

Monday, August 7-  Friday, August 11
 
Guest: Andy Nash- please see Andy's bio below
 
To participate, sign up for the list at http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Povertyliteracy <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Povertyliteracy> 
 
 
Literacy Discussion List Colleagues,
 
Next week, Monday August 7 - Friday August 11, we have the great good fortune to have as a guest on the Poverty, Race, & Literacy Discussion List Andy Nash, Staff Development Specialist at the New England Literacy Resource Center at World Education.  As you can see from her bio below, Andy has experience in lots of different adult education literacy areas, but her overarching concern has been relating literacy to social justice and advocacy for participation in our democracy.  
 
Andy introduces this discussion by asking *us* some questions (see paragraph 2 below).  She intends to learn from us as we learn from her.
 
Please read her bio and look up The Change Agent (www.nelrc.org/changeagent <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.nelrc.org/changeagent> ) and, if you would like to participate in the discussion, join the list at <http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Povertyliteracy> and be ready starting Monday to participate in a lively discussion about literacy and social justice issues!
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Andy Nash's bio:
My work in adult education over the past 20 years has focused on building the capacity of adults to use their developing skills to be more informed and active participants in a democracy. I've brought this perspective to my work in ESOL, civic participation, worker education, family literacy, standards-based education, and many years of resource and professional development.

Having just finished editing a new resource about bringing issues of social justice into the classroom (see below), I am interested in thinking about the role such materials can play in adult ed. Do you find resources for talking about issues such as gentrification or globalization useful, or do you think educators should stick to more immediately tangible issues such as advocating for more affordable daycare, interpreters at clinics, etc.? In the short amount of time we have, is it necessary to stick with the "local," which is often speaking up for better community services, or are your students also interested in more general problems such as growing incarceration rates, the war(s), or the current debate over whether a president has the right to sidestep federal laws passed by Congress? In the interest of being as participatory and responsive to students as possible, does it matter if an issue gets raised by the teacher rather than being initiated by the students? And, of course, what does it all have to do with improving basic academic, language, and job skills?

These are all questions we think about when we work on The Change Agent (www.nelrc.org/changeagent), a biannual social justice newspaper for adult educators and learners published by the New England Literacy Resource Center at World Education. It was conceived in 1994 as a tool to educate and mobilize teachers and learners to apply advocacy skills in response to impending federal funding cutbacks for adult education.
The first issue was so well received by teachers that we continued to produce more issues. Now well established as a unique resource within the adult education community, The Change Agent continues to promote social action as an important part of the adult learning experience.
Each issue explores a different social justice theme through news articles, opinion pieces, classroom activities and lessons, poems, cartoons, interviews, project descriptions, and printed and Web-based resources.

"Through the Lens of Social Justice: Using The Change Agent in Adult Education" is a newly published book that celebrates The Change Agent's first decade by gathering its best and most timeless pieces and by offering guidance for educators in how to use the paper.

Chapter 1 introduces readers to the kinds of articles and tools that are available in The Change Agent and how they can be used. These
include: "Ways In," short visual or textual prompts that can be used with students to draw out their experiences, questions, and concerns about social issues; "Issue Analyses," articles that examine an issue (prisons, school vouchers, health care, etc.) by looking at how our systems work and for whose benefit; and "Students Making Change," accounts of students who have used what they have learned to take some kind of individual or collective action outside the classroom. 

Chapter 2 provides guidance in how teachers can use the articles to build thematic curriculum units, with sample units for ABE, ESOL, and GED. And Chapter 3 is a collection of articles about the challenges of bringing social justice issues into the classroom and the creative strategies that teachers have used to deal with those challenges.

Subject: [ProgramLeadership 82] Newly-revised site for the Assessment
	Special Collection
Message-ID: <6A5CE13D731DE249BC61CB8C5C474B0A04B36EED@UTKFSVS1.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi everyone:

Here's some exciting news on the assessment front, from the good folks at the LINCS-Assessment Special Collection. Enjoy!

 

**************************************************************************************************************************************

 

Dear colleagues,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

I'm so happy to announce the launch of the newly revised site of the LINCS Assessment Special Collection.  Please go to:  http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/assessment/ <https://tmail.utk.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/assessment/>  to check it out.

 

The site has on-line resources and materials that are organized based on the roles of people involved in the work, but please do not limit yourself to any one particular role area - many resources will be of interest to you in other areas.  In addition, while many resources are cross-posted, many are not, so I encourage you to surf around or do a keyword search at the site.  

 

Got a great cyber resource that you don't see in the Assessment Collection and you think it should be there?  Definitely let me know about it and I will make sure it gets into the review process for possible addition to the Collection.  I'm very interested in resources for use by teachers and tutors in the classroom, self assessment materials for students/learners, and any assessment materials from our international colleagues (I would like to build an international section).

 

Thanks!  Let me know what you think!!

Greetings colleagues,

Next week, Monday, August 28 thru Friday, September 1, the Content
Standards Discussion List will be hosting a guest discussion on the
CASAS Basic Skills Content Standards Project.  Our guests will be Jane
Eguez, Jim Harrison, and Linda Taylor from CASAS.

Please read the introductory information below which includes a link to
the CASAS website to help prepare you for the discussion.

Moderator, National Institute for Literacy's Content Standards
Discussion List (http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Contentstandards)


************************************

Since its inception, CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment
System) has focused on teaching and assessing basic skills in contexts
that are relevant and important to adult learners. CASAS has developed
and continues to refine a highly formalized hierarchy of competencies,
the application of basic skills that adults need to be fully functional
and productive members of society.

In the past few years, at the request of the CASAS National Consortium,
representing approximately 30 states, CASAS has begun development of
basic skills content standards as a formal part of the CASAS system.
This enhancement of the CASAS system is intended to assist and encourage
teachers to more fully integrate basic skills content standards and
functional competencies in instruction.

The basic skills content standards for Reading and Listening contain
simple, clearly stated, detailed statements that are leveled according
to the NRS Educational Functioning Levels, and are also related to CASAS
test items in several CASAS test series. The statements are divided into
Categories to assist teachers to navigate through the standards.

In the past two years, CASAS has worked with Iowa and California to
pilot these standards with teachers in a variety of adult education
programs. A number of useful teacher worksheets and other tools have
emerged from these efforts.

We invite you to learn more about the CASAS basic skills Content
Standards Project and to ask questions about it during the listserv
discussion next week. To prepare for this discussion, we refer you to
the CASAS website where you will find more detailed information about
the development of the standards, the standards themselves, worksheets
for teachers, and information about the pilot project in Iowa. Go to
http://www.casas.org/DirctDwnlds.cfm?mfile_id=4504&selected_id=1720&wtar
get=body

We look forward to engaging with you in this discussion next week.

Jane Eguez (jeguez at casas.org) , Jim Harrison (jharrison at casas.org ) and
Linda Taylor (ltaylor at casas.org ), CASAS

Dear colleagues,

 

Beginning Tuesday, September 19th through Friday, September 22nd, there will be a guest 

 

discussion on the NIFL Technology and Literacy list on "Assistive Technology, Instructional Technology, and Universal Design Strategies for Adult Literacy" with guest facilitator Dr. Dave Edyburn of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

To participate in the discussion, sign up for the Technology and Literacy List at 

http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Technology

 

Title: Assistive Technology, Instructional Technology, and Universal Design Strategies for Adult Literacy

 

Overview

 

Adult literacy professionals and volunteers are well aware of the effects of school failure and the lifelong impact of failing to acquire functional reading skills. In this online event, Dr. Dave Edyburn a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will engage participants in a discussion about three forms of technology and their application for adult literacy learners and programs.

 

On day one, participants will be introduced to the concept of assistive technology and learn about products that have been designed to support struggling readers.

 

On day two, conversations will focus on instructional technology. That is, how can technology be used to teach and assess critical literacy skills.

 

On day three, participants will learn about universal design for learning and the promise of this approach to address the needs of diverse learners in ways that combine the best attributes of assistive and instructional technology.

 

Participants in this online event will have the opportunity to learn about practical applications of technology in adult literacy programs, ask questions, and obtain information about software and web resources.

The International Classroom and School Virtual Visit (Virtual School)
project is beginning its eighth year, linking classrooms across the
world to enable students to meet each other virtually, share
information about their cultures, their classrooms, and their
communities, and to build cultural understanding. Classes can include
English as a Second or Other Language (ESOL/ESL), Adult Basic
Education (ABE, GED),  elementary or secondary education, or family
literacy.  Students can be from age seven to adult.

As in past years, we hope classes will engage in lively written
discussion, and possibly choose a film, book or current event to
discuss. This year we have set up a free wiki, so classes don't have
to create their own web pages, and we will help teachers to use free
Internet telephony so their classes can talk to each other if they
can find a time that works to do that.

If you would like to participate in this year's project,

1. Sign up on the I.C.V.V. e-list  by going to:

        http://lists.literacytent.org/mailman/listinfo/icvv

        Scroll down the page to choose an ID and password.  That's it,
easy and free.

2. Once you receive confirmation that you are on the I.C.V.V. e-list,
send an e-mail to:

          icvv at lists.literacytent.org

indicating your interest in participating this year.  Be sure to
describe your class, when it will begin, and what age group or
nationality you would prefer to partner with.

If you would like to look at classroom virtual visit projects from
previous years go to:

        http://www.otan.us/webfarm/emailproject/school.htm

and then choose

      http://www.otan.us/webfarm/emailproject/school2003.htm

We look forward to your joining the project.  Let one of us know if
you have questions.

And please pass this information on -- by e-mail or electronic list 
-- to teachers who you think might be interested.

All the best,

Colleagues,

In preparation for celebrating International Literacy Day, on 
September 5th-7th the Special Topics Discussion List is pleased to 
welcome  Ms. Janet Looney representing the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development(OECD).  Janet is the leader of the 
Centre for Educational Research and Innovation program known as What 
Works in Innovation in Education. Its current focus is formative 
assessment.  The discussion will serve to introduce some of OECD's 
work in international education. The primary focus of the discussion 
will be on the value of formative assessment for promoting higher 
levels of learner achievement, greater equity of outcomes, and the 
development of "learning to learn" skills.

Not a term widely known in the U.S., formative assessment refers to 
what teachers and learners do in the classroom to assess learning 
progress.  An assessment is _formative_ when information gathered in 
the assessment process is used to modify teaching and learning 
activities.  It's an assessment _for_ learning  not just _of_ learning.

Between 2002 and 2004, the What Works program explored formative 
assessment in lower secondary classrooms in eight international 
systems [see Formative Assessment: Improving Learning in Secondary 
Classrooms (2005)].  OECD will publish a second study addressing 
formative assessment for adult basic skill learners in 2007.

Together, the two studies are intended to strengthen understanding of 
effective approaches to lifelong learning.

FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IN LOWER SECONDARY SCHOOLS

While many teachers incorporate aspects of formative assessment into 
their teaching, it is not often practiced systematically.  The What 
Works study, Formative Assessment: Improving Learning in Secondary 
Classrooms (2005), features exemplary cases from secondary schools in 
eight systems and international research reviews, and relates these 
to the broader policy environment.  The study shows how teachers have 
addressed barriers to systematic practice, and how school and policy 
leaders may apply the principles of formative assessment to promote 
constructive cultures of assessment and evaluation throughout 
education systems.

FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IN ADULT BASIC SKILL PROGRAMS

Formative approaches may be particularly appropriate for adults with 
basic skill needs, the focus of the current What Works study.  
Instructors using formative approaches are able to tailor instruction 
more closely to the needs of diverse adult learners.  Formative 
approaches also place an explicit focus on identifying and building 
upon learners' prior knowledge and skills - whether gained in formal 
education settings, or informal work or other settings.

The OECD study on "Improving Teaching and Learning for Adults with 
Basic Skill Needs through Formative Assessment" , now underway, is:

1. Developing studies of exemplary teaching and assessment practice 
for adults with basic skill needs
2. Bringing together international scholarship on teaching and 
assessment for adults with basic skill needs
3. Identifying effective policy levers for improving the quality of 
provision in the adult basic skills sector, and
4. Creating opportunities for policy officials, researchers and 
practitioners to exchange insights and ideas on promoting effective 
teaching, assessment and evaluation.

We look forward to your subscribing to this three-day discussion.  To 
do so, go to:

Just in time for International Literacy Day on September 8, the National
Institute for Literacy has launched a series of webpages on its website
(www.nifl.gov) to highlight worldwide efforts to address and combat literacy
problems. The International Perspectives webpages allow American adult
literacy and English language teachers and students quick access to
information about:
	*	adult literacy education in other countries and cultures,
including both developing and industrialized countries, and including
curriculum and outcomes standards for adult education in other countries 
	*	international comparative studies of adult literacy and
PreK-12 education, and 
	*	international efforts to raise literacy levels (e.g.UNESCO,
International Reading Association, and the Venezuelan and Argentinian
literacy campaigns) 
The Institute plans to continue to build on the information on the
International Perspective pages
(<http://www.nifl.gov/nifl/international/intro.html>) as they develop into a
central site for worldwide literacy resources.
	The National Institute for Literacy provides leadership on literacy
issues, including the improvement of reading instruction for children,
youth, and adults. In consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education,
Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Institute serves as a national
resource on current, comprehensive literacy research, practice, and policy.

Assessment of Adult Literacy (9/6/2006) 

Results from the Health Literacy component of the 2003 National Assessment
of Adult Literacy (NAAL) were just released. The health literacy findings
are based on the first large-scale national assessment designed specifically
to measure the health literacy of adults living in America. This report
measures health literacy among American adults including their ability to
read, understand, and apply health-related information in English. 

Findings include:
*	The majority of American adults (53 percent) had Intermediate health
literacy. Fewer than 15 percent of adults had either Below Basic or
Proficient health literacy. 
*	Women had higher average health literacy than men. 
*	Adults who were ages 65 and older had lower average health literacy
than younger adults. 
*	Hispanic adults had lower average health literacy than adults in any
other racial/ethnic group.

Hello, everyone,
 
The latest brief from CAELA, Supporting Adult English Language Learners' Transitions to Postsecondary Education, by Julie Mathews-Aydinli, is now availabe on line at http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/transition.html <http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/transition.html> . 
 
Adult immigrants studying English in the United States have diverse educational backgrounds. Some have earned graduate degrees, while others have had little or no access to education. Their goals and expectations for future education and employment are also diverse. 
 
This CAELA brief focuses on transitions from adult ESL programs postsecondary education. For a discussion of classroom-level (e.g., how to develop vocabulary needed for academic classes, types of reading to do in class, etc.) and programmatic (e.g., orientation needed, suggestions for how the adult ESL programs can collaborate with the associated postsecondary institutions, etc.) approaches that can further such transitions, read the brief at  http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/transition.html. 
 
 
 
Coming this fall: briefs on content standards for the adult English language classroom and integrating instruction, content standards, and assessment in the adult ESL classroom.

Announcing a discussion on ELL in the workplace!

 

 One issue that has been of interest on the Workplace Literacy Discussion List has been serving the needs and goals of employers while at the same time serving the needs of adult immigrants on the job and in their lives. On the Adult English Language Discussion List, issues related to workplace and adult English language learners have been discussed for many years. Workplace ESOL classes are not new, but, as more workplaces throughout the country hire immigrants who may not be proficient in English, new teachers come on board and new needs (and funding sources) arise. New questions also arise.  

 

We have home-grown expertise on both the Workplace and ELL Discussion Lists. Subscribers on both lists have been involved in managing state and federal workplace grants, developing curricula and materials, teaching or training other teachers in workplace contexts.  We could all learn a lot from sharing questions and experiences.    Lynda Terrill, moderator of the English Language Learner Discussion List and  Donna Brian, moderator of the Workplace Literacy Discussion List,  invite you to  access this combined expertise in a cross-list discussion: a focused, simultaneous, shared discussion on both lists on issues related to the workplace and adult immigrants.  We hope that you will  join us in sharing  philosophies, approaches, and techniques-lessons learned-with each other in a week long dialogue combining the two lists. We have set next week-September 18-22-as the time scheduled for this shared discussion to take place. 

 


Discussion Questions


Some important questions we hope may be addressed in the discussion are: 

*	What are effective ways of planning, implementing, and evaluating (adult ESL) workplace classes? 
*	What types of workplace classes have proven most effective and why? 
*	How can teachers and administrators develop curricula and materials that meet the needs and goals of the learners in class as well as the needs and expectations of employers? 
*	What are effective and appropriate approaches for teaching issues related to culture, civil rights, and responsibilities on the job? 

Background Reading and Resources

Hi everybody.
The following is posted on behalf of David Rosen and should be of special interest to those of you who provide leadership in literacy/ABE/ESOL programs  working with incarcerated individuals.
 
--------------------

Dear Colleagues,

Beginning today, on the Special Topics Discussion List, we are 
pleased to have a panel of expert guests in corrections education. 
The topic will focus on research and professional wisdom in 
corrections family literacy, and on the transition from corrections 
education to community education for inmates who have been released.

Our guests are:

John Linton, Correctional Education, Office of Safe and Drug Free 
Schools, U.S. Department of Education

John is the program officer for two correctional education grant 
programs ("Lifeskills for State and Local Prisoners" and "Grants to 
States for Workplace and Community Transition Training for 
Incarcerated Youth Offenders") in the Office of Safe and Drug Free 
Schools of the U. S. Department of Education.  John formerly served 
the State of Maryland as the director of adult correctional education 
programs.  He has been with the federal agency since 2001, originally
with the Office of Vocational and Adult Education.

Stephen J. Steurer, Ph.D., Executive Director, Correctional Education 
Association. The Correctional Education Association is a professional 
organization
of educators who work in prisons, jails and juvenile settings.

William R. Muth, PhD, Assistant Professor, Reading Education and 
Adult Literacy, Virginia Commonwealth University

Bill is an Assistant Professor of Adult and Adolescent Literacy at 
Virginia Commonwealth University. Until August 2005, he was the 
Education Administrator for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Other 
positions with the FBOP included: reading teacher, principal, and 
Chief of the Program Analysis Branch. In 2004 Bill earned his 
doctorate in adult literacy from George Mason University. His 
dissertation, "Performance and Perspective: Two Assessments of 
Federal Prisoners in Literacy Programs" won the College Reading 
Association's Dissertation of the Year Award. His research interests 
include Thirdspace and Reading Components theories, especially as 
these apply to prison-based family literacy programs and children of 
incarcerated parents.

After you have subscribed you will receive an email
asking you to confirm your subscription.  Please
reply immediately.
===========================================

The following readings are recommended by the panelists as background 
for the discussion:

1. "Locked Up and Locked Out, An Educational Perspective on the US 
Prison Population," Coley, Richard J. and Barton, Paul E., 2006
Available on line at the ETS web site:

http://tinyurl.com/qmzfa (short URL)

2. "Learning to Reduce Recidivism: A 50-state analysis of 
postsecondary correctional education policy," Institute for Higher 
Education Policy, Erisman, Wendy and Contardo, Jeanne B., 2005. 
Available on line at the IHEP web site:

http://tinyurl.com/pj2sh (short URL)

3. "Understanding California Corrections" from the California Policy 
Research Center, U of C. (Chapter 4)
http://www.ucop.edu/cprc/documents/understand_ca_corrections.pdf

John Linton believes that California is a watershed state in 
corrections issues and policies , and that how things unfold there 
has great national significance.  He says that this is a thoughtful 
and well-informed report on the "overview" of the corrections 
situation in California -- including the role of treatment programs.
Education is not presented as a central issue, but it has a place -- 
as a piece of a bigger puzzle.

4. An article by Bill Muth in Exploring Adult Literacy can be found at

http://literacy.kent.edu/cra/2006/wmuth/index.html

The article contains other on-line links related to prison-based 
intergenerational programs. He recommends especially the link to the 
Hudson River Center's excellent publication, Bringing Family Literacy 
to Incarcerated Settings: An Instructional Guide at:

Colleagues,

The Adult Literacy Education Wiki (now with over 750 pages and nearly 
700 registered users) is becoming a very useful resource for teachers 
and other practitioners in adult literacy education.  It includes 30 
topics linking research, professional wisdom, and practice.  It 
offers easy-to-read archived discussions that were held on this and 
other discussion lists, links to research and other resources, 
questions (and sometimes answers) from teachers and other 
practitioners and researchers, a comprehensive adult literacy 
glossary, and more.  It's free, and it's designed for you.  Best of 
all, it's not only a set of informative web pages.  It's a community 
of practice.  You -- and your colleagues -- can easily add to and 
improve it. It's a wiki!

To check out the ALE wiki, go to:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Main_Page

You will see that some ALE topics need to be nurtured, and to grow. 
They need a Topic Leader.  Perhaps you would be the right person to 
be a Topic Leader. To see a list of topics and leaders, go to

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Topic_Leaders

If you are interested in being a (volunteer) Topic Leader for an 
existing topic, or if you would like to help develop a new topic, e-
mail me and tell me about yourself and your interest.

Dear Colleagues,
I'm interested in adding a component to our curriculum that  
strengthens English Language Learner's  skills in "learning to  
learn."  Do any of you know of any programs where they have developed  
such a thing?  When I worked in an EFL setting in Japan we used a  
language learning notebook, discussed and reinforced behaviors for  
successful language learning, and gained student feedback on what  
helped/what hindered their learning.   We often use learning styles  
inventories with Native English Speakers, but to my knowledge one has  
not be simplified for use with ELLs.  I'd be curious to hear how  
others may be incorporating these kinds of activities into their  
programs.

Any ideas or sharing of experiences would be appreciated!

Greetings colleagues,

 

Next week, Monday, September 25 through Friday, September 29, the Content Standards Discussion List will be hosting a discussion on the U.S. Department of Education's efforts to support state-level adoption and institutionalization of content standards for adult learning.  Our guest will be Ronna Spacone from the Department's Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), Division of Adult Education and Literacy (DAEL).

 

Please read the introductory information below, which includes a link to the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse Website, to help prepare you for the discussion.  

 

You may begin posting your questions to Ronna this week.  I will collect the questions together and re-post when the discussion starts next week.

 

To participate in the discussion, sign up for the list at:

Discussion List (http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Contentstandards)

 

********************************************************************************************

 

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Education, OVAE, has used National Leadership Activity funds to provide technical assistance and support to states already committed to standards-based education reform.  

 

OVAE's efforts to promote the implementation of state-level content standards began with the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse Project, operated by the American Institutes of Research (AIR), 2003-2005.  The project included:

 

1.	Technical assistance and networking for state collaborative working groups or consortia in 14 states,

 

2.	The development and publication of "A Process Guide for Establishing State Adult Education Content Standards" and

 

3.	The development of the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse (AECSW) Website.  The AECSW site provides universal access to existing state standards as well as nationally developed content standards in the areas of reading, mathematics, and English language acquisition.  Since it was launched in May 2005, eleven states and CASAS and Equipped for the Future have contributed their standards for posting.  The site also serves to disseminate the "Process Guide for Establishing State Adult Education Content Standards" as well as the professional development materials that were developed for the State Standards Consortia project.  In preparation for our listserv discussion next week, I invite you to please visit the AECSW Website located at: (http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org <http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org/> ), which AIR continues to operate with OVAE. 

 

In September 2005, with the conclusion of the State Standards Consortia activities, OVAE funded a new activity to identify how best to continue to support states committed to the implementation of standards.  A six-month planning project was then conducted by MPR Associates, Inc., along with partner organizations Design Perspectives and World Education.  Planning activities included a literature review of noteworthy practices, an evaluation of the electronic warehouse, and an assessment of the needs of states to support standards-based education.  Twenty-four states chose to participate in the project.  Based on the results, OVAE has moved ahead and made plans for a new project scheduled to begin next month.

 

As in the past, the new activities will provide opportunities for interested states to work together and learn about standards-based education.  The project is expected to focus especially on the implementation of standards, including: how to translate standards into classroom instruction and curriculum and how to assess the implementation of standards to guide instructional improvement and program practice. 

 

I invite you to learn more about the Department of Education's efforts to promote state-level adoption of content standards and to ask questions about these activities during the listserv discussion.  Please refer to the various sections of the AECSW Website (http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org <http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org/> ) including the Guide, Warehouse, and Field Resources as well as the OVAE DAEL Website located at: (http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/index.html). 

 

I look forward to an interesting, engaging discussion and appreciate the opportunity to take part.  Thanks.

Hello Valley,

There is a Learning to Learn curriculum designed for community  
colleges that some adult secondary education programs have found  
useful.  It is not specifically designed for ELLs, but some of the  
strategies could be adapted.

CROSSPOSTED: Tips to handling multiple postings 

As you know, the National Institute for Literacy's Discussion Lists are very
active. In addition to messages directly related to the subject of each
Discussion List, often we have announcements that are posted to all the
lists. If you are subscribed to two, three or all lists, you may receive
multiple copies of one post - this is called "cross-posting." We do this to
ensure that the maximum number of subscribers receives the messages -
usually an announcement that may be of interest to subscribers on more than
one list. While this can be cumbersome, this is done to ensure that you, our
subscribers, are kept up-to-date on the latest news, guest speakers, etc.

Here are a few tips to help you manage the number of repeat emails into your
inbox.

	1)	Change your subscriber settings to receive postings in
digest format. 
	2)	Disable mail delivery from the lists while you are away. You
still remain subscribed to the list, but will not receive postings while you
are away. When you return, you can review the archives for posts that you
missed while you were away.
	3)	You do not have to subscribe to a list to benefit from a
discussion. Discussions are archived at the Institute's website and can be
sorted by thread, date, and author, and can also be searched by keyword.
	4)	When sending a message to multiple lists, start with
CROSS-POSTED in the subject line, so that other subscribers can recognize
that it is a cross-post that they may have already received.

For information and instructions on changing your subscriber settings please
visit our Discussion List Help page at
<http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/help/help_mailman.html>

To access Discussion List archives, visit
<http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/list_archives.html>

We hope that these tips will help you reduce the number of emails you
receive every day, while still keeping you well-informed. Thank you for your
continued support and participation in the National Institute for Literacy's
Discussion Lists.

Greetings, 
October is almost here. That means it's time to register for the
?Bridges to Opportunity: Workforce Development for English Language
Learners? conference taking place October 27th and 28th. Registration is
limited to 100 participants, and pre-registration is required. You must
register in advance to attend. There will be no on-site registration!

The conference fee is just $100 for a two-day event, or $75 for a group
of five or more. For more information please visit the conference web
site at:http://www.lagcc.cuny.edu/ace/bridges. Sign up soon to reserve your space. You can register online at  http://www.lagcc.cuny.edu/ace/bridges/registration.htm . If you have any questions about registration please contact Ros Orgel at
718-482-5448 or roslyno at lagcc.cuny.edu .

Bringing together who provide key services for ELL students developing
both language and job-related skills, Bridges to Opportunity is a
proactive, working conference.  The keynote speaker is Dr. Heide Spruck
Wrigley, president of Literacy International.  Three  panels made up of
a range of program managers, instructors, policy makers, and career
counselors will grapple with essential questions including (just to name
a few):

?	How can employers, educators and other stake holders be brought together to identify  and develop solutions to address the workforce development needs of  English language learners?  What are national models for developing such initiatives  in needs assessment ?
?	Many immigrant workers come with prior credentials and experience which remain unused because there no easily accessible ways to re-enter their previous careers. The challenge is to re-integrate skilled immigrant workers  into careers where their skills can be best utilized. How is this best achieved ? 
?	Employer expectations and assumptions about  English language instructional  goals including the length of training are often different from those of educators. How can these different sets of expectations and goals be managed in customized training programs ?

Your participation and recommendations are a key ingredient in this
event - it is not a lecture-style conference, but a pro-active,
participatory event where your input and experience count.

Sponsored by the Center for Immigrant Education and Training and the
Center for Teaching and Learning of LaGuardia Community College, Bridges
for Opportunity is funded in part by a grant from the President's High
Growth Job Training Initiative, as implemented by the U.S. Department
of Labor's Employment and Training Administration.

Friends,

I think you will be pleased by the attached news release, issued  
jointly today by Dollar General Corporation and CAAL. This has been  
in the making for some months. I hope it will bring a new sense of  
hope and possibility to those who toil in the adult education and

who appreciate the findings of the 2003 NAALs. Should you be unable

Dear Colleagues in Adult Education and Literacy:

 

I can not tell you how very good this news is!  I just returned from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce National Summit on Education and Workforce
Development.  Promotion of No Child Left Behind was the number one agenda
item, closely followed by criticism of the country's school systems and the
fact that they are unable to turn out graduates prepared for post secondary
education and training or employment.  NEVER ONCE was Adult Education
mentioned, much less recognized as the safety net for many of those already
left behind.  As an adult educator and businesswoman, I was one of a very
small minority of participants.  The educators who presented were few in
number and for the most part, I would have to say out of touch with reality.
I attended, knowing that there was a political agenda, but like a few
others, went seeking a fair and level playing field.  

 

After listening to numerous reports of countless million-dollar studies to
identify the skills and proficiencies needed by learners to enter employment
and/or post secondary education and training, another attendee (well
informed, from the workforce development side of the house) and I wondered
why this gathering of minds had never heard of SCANS or Equipped for the
Future. 

 

One redeeming moment:  the National Work Readiness Credential (an outgrowth
of EFF) was included in a brief presentation.  However, it was being touted
to K-12 and chambers by Junior Achievement Worldwide!  No reference to its
adult education roots, its potential in reference to adult learners,
including the many, many parents of the children being left behind.  

 

The growing "wedge" - adult learner populations of parents, out of school
youth, drop outs, immigrants, and minorities - remained nameless and
unacknowledged during the three day summit.  

 

Hopefully the National Commission on Adult Literacy can help us find our
voice!  Best of luck to all of you in your endeavors.  Now, do I need
another cup of coffee, or is Texas representation missing from your
commissioners' list?

There are so many elements for us to work on, pursue and especially look at

	Dear Discussion List subscribers,

	As the National Institute for Literacy enters a new fiscal year, we
have taken steps to streamline the way we deliver professional development
through our discussion lists. A major change that will directly affect you
is the closing of the Content Standards and Program Leadership & Improvement
lists as of October 30, 2006.

The Institute would like to thank Aaron Kohring for moderating the Content
Standards List and Peggy Maguire for moderating the Program Leadership &
Improvement List. They have worked hard to bring relevant issues to the
forefront and to stimulate discussions that help explore issues of content
standards and program leadership and improvement. We will continue to
provide access to discussion archives on our website.

	We recognize that many of the issues that impact Content Standards
and Program Leadership & Improvement carry across all the subject areas of
other Discussion Lists. For that reason, we invite you to subscribe to any
or all of our other Discussion Lists. We encourage you to be active
participants in these lists.

	The Institute's lists include:

	Adult Literacy Professional Development 
	Assessment 
	Adult English Language Learners
	Family Literacy 
	Focus on Basics 
	Health & Literacy 
	Learning Disabilities 
	Poverty, Race, Women and Literacy*
	Special Topics 
	Technology & Literacy 
	Workplace Literacy

	Descriptions and instructions on how to register for the Institute's
Discussion Lists can be found at
http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/discussions.html

* Please note that we are combining the Women and Literacy List with the
Poverty, Race and Literacy List as of November 6, 2006, because the issues
that affect one list, often overlap with issues on the other list.

Subject: [Assessment 545] Seeking Model Programs for Accountability Project



Dear Colleagues,

As you know, funders in both the public and private sectors are placing
heightened expectations upon people who manage literacy and adult education
programs. The funders want to know:
o       Are programs able to demonstrate real learning gains among students?
o       Are programs worthy of the trust placed in them by community
partners, business volunteers, students, and other stakeholders?
o       Do program personnel have the information they need to improve their
programs and allocate precious resources wisely?

ProLiteracy, in partnership with the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, is
working to help program managers acquire the knowledge and tools they need
to answer questions like these. This new, three-year project is called the
Dollar General/ProLiteracy Performance Accountability Initiative. Together,
we will 1) identify successful accountability practices being used in a
variety of literacy and adult education programs, and 2) use the practices
to develop and deliver training modules and print resources to improve
performance accountability.

Right now we are looking for up to eight exemplary literacy and adult
education programs to serve as models as we develop the first training
module: Data Collection and Management. You may be part of a program that
does a good job collecting and managing data. If so, please consider
nominating your program. If you know of another program that would be a good
model, please forward this message to that program's director. We would also
appreciate your help in disseminating this call for model programs
throughout your networks. The nomination information and form may be
downloaded from the ProLiteracy Web site by using the following links:

?       www.proliteracy.org/downloads/guidelines.doc
?       www.proliteracy.org/downloads/application_form.doc

It is important to act quickly, as our deadline for accepting nominations
via e-mail or mail is 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2006. You may fill
out and submit the nomination form on paper or online. See the form for
detailed instructions.

Model programs will receive a $1,500 stipend, increased visibility, and an
opportunity to make a positive impact on the adult education and literacy
field.

We appreciate your help in this critical endeavor and hope to hear from you
by Nov. 8.

If you have any questions, please contact me via e-mail at
mdaniels at proliteracy.org.

Research on the Economic Impact of the GED Diploma Panel

The National Institute for Literacy (Institute) and the National Center for
the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) announce the Research on
the Economic Impact of the GED Diploma Panel, a 30-minute video produced by
the Institute. This panel discussion focuses on the economic benefits that
accrue to holders of the General Educational Development (GED) credential.
It is based on a review by John Tyler of eight recent (published and
working) research papers on the GED.  Several of these papers were authored
by John Tyler, Richard Murnane, and John Willett, researchers with NCSALL
whose work has influenced what we know about the economic benefits of the
GED.  Presenters include John Tyler, Sara Fass, and Sue Snider; the
moderator is David Rosen.

Transitioning Adults to College: Adult Basic Education Program Models
by Cynthia Zafft, Silja Kallenbach, and Jessica Spohn
This NCSALL Occasional Paper describes five models that the staff at the New
England Literacy Resource Center at World Education, Inc., categorized
through a survey of adult education centers with transition components from
around the United States. This NCSALL Occasional Paper describes the five
models-Advising, GED-Plus, ESOL, Career Pathways, and College
Preparatory-and themes and recommendations that others contemplating adult
transition services might find helpful. It also chronicles the experiences
of four states (Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, and Oregon) in their efforts
to institutionalize transitions for adults. To download the paper, go to
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=26

Beyond the GED: Making Conscious Choices About the GED and Your Future
Newly revised to include new data and information on the Internet, this
guide for GED instructors offers lesson plans and helps teachers develop as
professionals. It also gives adult learners an opportunity to practice
writing, use graphs, read charts, and analyze research findings on the
economic impact of the GED. To download the guide, go to
