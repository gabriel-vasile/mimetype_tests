Kenneth L. & Linda P. Lay
CAR Comments
9/4/97

Policy Exceptions:

B24) PFS not on NB certified form, lacks contingent liabilities and is not signed by Linda
P. Lay - a waiver is requested based on our favorable experience with both the Lays and the Enron
Corporation. In addition, we are properly secured by a high-quality portfolio of diversified
securities, primarily Enron (59.3% of collateral) and Compaq Computers (30.9%). The RM has
received a verbal confirmation verifying no other contingencies other than with NB.

Pricing Exceptions:

No fee on committed lines - the pricing exceptions are mitigated by a projected ROE of
39.23% and our extensive relationship with the Borrower and Enron. PCG relationship is
projected to generate $251,167 in total relationship earnings.

Executive Summary

This CAR seeks to renew 2 existing facilities to Kenneth & Linda Lay:

  $30rnm CLN - this facility was used to consolidate several different lines last year and will
mntinue to be used to fund business investments and personal expenses. This line is
secured with Marketable Securities, primarily shares of Enron Corporation and Compaq
Computers pledged by KLL & LPL Investments, a family limited partnership. There is
currently $29,920m o/s on this line versus $31,193m in collateral value ($44.6mm IvfV);

1. $750m CLN - this unsecured line is also used by Lay for business investments. There is
currently $400m o/s on this line.

Pricing for the stock secured facility will continue at Libor +100bp with 30, 60, 90, 180 or 360 day
options. Unsecured line will continue at Prime - '/2. Repayment for both facilities will continue to
be interest only payable quarterly with full principal due at maturity. The stock secured facility
will continue to have a 70% advance and a 75% margin call which is governed by a collateral
niaintena-n, e agreement. The secured facility will be risk rated a 4 while the unsecured line will be
risk rated a 5. CES will continue at "Maintain" with TCE after this renewal to be $41,134m.

In addition to the above lines, these CAR comments will also serve to:

3. Renew a $2,750m CLN for KLL & LPL Investments (see separate CAR) - KLL & LPL
Investments (KLI) is the Lay's family limited partnership which received a large portion of his
assets in 1994 as an estate planning tool. In addition to Ken & Linda, the Lay's five children
are also General Partners, although Ken & Linda are the only ones to have any control over the
assets. This line is secured with Marketable Securities, primarily shares of Eli Lilly & Co., and
the tine is underwritten based on the strength of the Lays and the liquid collateral. There is
currently $2,087m o/s on this line versus $2,102m in collateral value. The Lays fully guarantee
this line;

4. Renew a 1 year PAL in the amount of $42mm which was in effect during this past year and

Transactional Analysis
'Critical Issues

Leverage is 1.18x NB's adjusted net worth ($40mm1$34mm) - although a significant
portion of Nlr. Lay's marketable securities are pledged, the risk is mitigated by Lay's significant
cash flow generating ability as well as his remaining liquidity. Lay reports 1996 income of
$8:2mm which is a combination of salary/bonus of approximately S3mm and exercising of stock
options (,$4mm- $5mm annually or approximately 150m to 200m shares). He typically exercises
this amount annually although he has the ability to do more or less as the situation requires- He
can continue to exercise this amount over the next several years especially as Enron continues
to grant more options, typically 200m to 300m per year (assumes that Enron's share price
continues to appreciate). Although estimated unencumbered liquidity is approximately $ 10mm,
this does not include his Enron and Compaq stock options which have an approximate market
value of $33mm. Lay has stated to the RM that he intends to reduce his leverage from the
current 35% of assets to 25%-30% of assets over the next 2-3 years. Lay's liquidity consists of
the following:

1) Lay's primary liquidity consists of large capitalization stocks and mutual funds which are
currently worth an estimated $61,080m (owned either directly by the Lays or the family
limited partnership). Potential exposure (stock secured and unsecured debt) reliant on this
liquidity is approximately $33,500m which represents the three NB loan's being renewed.
Current liquidity covers stock reliant debt 1.93x($64.5mm/$33.5mm);

2) The value of Lay's currently exercisable Enron and Compaq stock options is
approximately $33mm (pre-tax). The estimated tax deferred liability is $13.1mm.

3) Lay also has other semi-liquid asset-., pru..u ily $3.5mm d"f"..cd .....v,..., 1_I.
Enron. While this is clearly less liquid than marginable stock, it does represent a
solid additional source of liquidity which could be used to retire debt.

Ken Lay has an asset and income concentration in Enron Corporation - cash
flow is dependent on his ability to exercise the Enron options - both his wealth
and recurring income is concentrated in Enron common stock, options and his
employment with the company. As seen on the attached cash flow worksheet, Ken Lay
relies oa his stock options to accommodate his lifestyle and meet debt service (approx
$4mm to $5mm per year). 'Me risk is mitigated, however, by the strong performance of
Enron under Lay's leadership. As evidence of Enron's confidence in Lay, the board of
directors recently renewed Lay's employment contract with Enron for five years, which
included a 1.2mm share stock option grant. The company is expected to continue to
perform well due to its diversification across most segments of the natural gas business.
The recent merger between Enron and Portland General provides a number of strategic
assets necessary for Enron to realize its ambitious wholesale electric marketing and
retail natural gas and electric marketing goals. Although the 2nd quarter earnings have
reflected a significant downturn in earnings of $-1.71 per share, this is largely a result of
a one time charge of $1.80 per share to settle a dispute in the North Sea and a $.30 per
share write down of some plant equipment. Actual EPS would have been $.40 per share
versus $.46 year ago. Merrill Lynch reports that Enron's business fundamentals and
growth prospects remain strong (Long term Buy).

  Risk of ability to meet margin calls - the current value of collateral provides adequate
capacity to meet margin calls ($45.9mm/$33.5mm). Lay's unencumbered liquidity. 810mm, is
sufficient to meet a 23% drop in collateral value to return margin to a 70% advance rate.
Furthermore, Lay has $33mm in option value that is realizable (gross). Lay has stated that, in

the event, of a margin call, he would liquidate Enron savings & ESOP ($3.l.mm) deferred income
plans ($3.5mm) exercise options, and sell Enron stock, if necessary.

  Death, Estate Taxes, Etc. The creation of the family partnership completed the majority of
Lay's estate planning. He currently has $47mm in life insurance policies (mostly second-to-die
policies) which is sufficient to.pay off all debt.

Relationship Analysis:
Ken Lay is the Chairman and CEO of Enron Corporation, a large Energy Group customer. He is a
high-profile executive who leads one of the largest fully integrated natural gas companies in the
world. Lay has been with Enron since 1985 and has been Chairman and CEO for over five years.
Lay is also a Director of Eli Lilly and Company, Compaq Computer Corporation, Enron Oil & Gas
Company, EOTT Energy Corp., and Trust Company of the West. Lay currently has other banking
relationships with Compass Bank and Texas Commerce Bank. His former relationship with
Charter Bank has been rolled into our pool of facilities since the recent acquisition.

Financial
Ken Lay has an employment contract from Enron which provides for a fixed annual salary of $990m
through February 2000. His total compensation package, however, was approximately $2mm over
base salary in 1996. This compensation is based on both company performance and return to
stockholders. Although the borrower's liquid position has been discussed. he also reports $8mm in
primary residences, $3.5mm in investment properties and $3mm in retirement assets. Only debt is
that issued by NB consisting of the unsecured and stock secured Lines of credit and first mortgages;
KLL & LPL Family Limited Partnership

For estate planning purposes, Lay transferred a large portion of his assets in 1994 to KLL & LPL
Investments, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership. Ken and Linda Lay are the managing and general
partners, Ken's five children are also general partners. However, only Ken and Linda have any
control over the assets. The partnership has the authority to both pledge assets and guarantee
Lay's personal debt. Lay's counsel, Baker & Botts, has provided us with a satisfactory legal opinion
regarding consideration issues. Counsel representing NationsBank, Sewell & Riggs, has reviewed
the partnership documents and has not. noted any major issues. Covenants will remain on KLL &
LPL Investments, Ltd., which require that the partnership will not dissolve or transfer assets, nor
w iii they incur additional debt without bank approval. This is important for both facilities as KLL
& LPL own most of the securities pledged against ken Lay's Line.

Salomon Bros Hold 5/1/97 Morgan Stanley Outperform 12/18/96

Company performance - Enron's strategy of growth through vertical integration has allowed it to
experience five years of solid performance over which compounded earnings per share have grown
at a rate of 20% annually. Although the first half of 1997 has reported disappointing results due to
the aforementioned non-recurring items, Valueline is optimistic that a strong second half may more
than offset the earnings shortfall to date. Merrill Lynch projects a slight decrease in EPS from
$2.31 in 1996 to $2.25 for 1997 but back up to $2.55 for 1998. Merrill anticipates the stock to reach
$43.25 over the next 12 to 18 months.
