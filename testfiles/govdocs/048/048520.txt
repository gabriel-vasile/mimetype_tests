Colleagues,

For several years, as a volunteer service, I have published the  
Literacy List, a large online collection of free Adult Basic  
Education and English language (ELL/ESL/ESOL) Web sites, electronic  
discussion lists ("listservs"), and other Internet resources for  
adult basic skills learners, teachers and tutors.

I have just updated it, removing a few outdated links and adding new  
ones.  Please have a look.  If you know of a good free Web site  
resource which you think should be added, please let me know.  The  
Literacy List gets better as a result of teachers sharing their  
favorite online resources.

You will find the Literacy List now in two locations:

	http://alri.org/literacylist.html

or

	http:newsomeassociates.com (Select Publications at the Bottom of the  
Page)

All the best in 2006.

	ideas and	info
Message-ID: <s3ba7f76.070@mail.jsi.com>

Hello List Members and Happy New Year to you all!

I hope you all had good holidays and some restful time off. I want to pass on an invitation for a new online networking and information-sharing website for Adult Literacy Education practitioners. It's called the ALE Wiki and can be found at:

 http://wiki.literacytent.org 

There are many topics listed that you can share information about, including a section on Research to Practice, Practice to Research. I will keep an eye on this section and cross-post items of particular interest to the FOB community, but I encourage all of you to check out this site for yourself and contribute your unique and valuable ideas!

Read on for a more complete description of the ALE Wiki from its creator, David Rosen.

Cheers,

Julie

>From David Rosen:

Dear Colleague,

Are you an adult literacy practitioner (e.g. a teacher, tutor or  
program administrator) who, through teaching, managing, reading,  
coursework, and/or dialogue, has gained professional wisdom - in one  
area or in many - that you would like to share? Maybe you have been  
thinking about your practice for some time, and are now ready to  
write about it for the first time. Perhaps you have written about  
your practice and published your thoughts already.  Perhaps the  
professional wisdom you value is embodied in someone else's writing,  
and this has so influenced and benefited you in your practice that  
you want others to know about this writing.  Perhaps you don't have  
answers but you have questions you would like to share.

I invite you to join your colleagues in contributing knowledge -  
professional wisdom and research - to others who are working in the  
field of adult literacy education (including English language  
learning.)  I invite you to contribute to - and benefit from - an  
adult literacy education community of practice.

The Adult Literacy Education (ALE) Wiki has an odd name.  For some, a  
community of practice with such a name cannot be taken seriously. For  
others, especially for those who may be familiar with the world's  
largest, and well-respected encyclopedia, the Wikipedia, a wiki is an  
innovation, a presence, and a power in 21st century world knowledge.   
The ALE Wiki is a serious and beneficial undertaking to capture and  
make available our field's knowledge and wisdom.

Like most wikis, the ALE Wiki is a collaborative volunteer effort.   
Nearly five hundred people in our field have registered so far in its  
one year of existence. Over forty people have taken the time to  
introduce themselves.  Several people are now responsible for  
developing topic areas such as Assessment, Professional Development,  
Technology, Public Policy, Workforce Development, Family Literacy,  
Numeracy and others.

How can you learn more and get involved?  You could:

* Visit the ALE Wiki regularly at http://wiki.literacytent.org 
* Register at http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php? 
title=Special:Userlogin&returnto=Main_Page  or, for short, http:// 
tinyurl.com/a8gz
* Introduce yourself at http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/WhosHere 
* Pick one or more topic areas and add your professional wisdom or  
research: answer a question, amplify someone else's answer, cite a  
good reference, define a word in the glossary, add articles you have  
written (or references to them) or add to or clarify something that  
you - or someone else - has written in the ALE Wiki
* Become a Topic Area Leader - for an existing topic area that needs  
a leader, or for a new area that you would like to add (See a  
description of this role at: http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/ 
AleAreaLeader ) or
* Become An ALE Wikiteer - get on the mailing list and receive a  
weekly Wiki update.

There is no cost involved - only your time.  But there is benefit -  
to you and to your colleagues.  I hope you will accept this invitation.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.

David J. Rosen
ALE Wiki organizer

You should be able to send her to the Adult Education Center in the county
where she lives, as they should be able to help her with literacy skills.
Study times are usually set up so that they have a one on one relationship
and privacy from other students. Volunteers are often used with low literacy
level students, meetings can be at the library or any other place both feel
safe and comfortable.

Dear Cesar,

I would suggest that this woman find a friend who can help her to find
an Adult Basic Education program in her local area, preferably one with
a family literacy program, which could help her children's and her own
emerging literacy skills together. 

If she can find someone to help her (or possibly you) who has internet
access, try the National Institute for Literacy's program directory at:

www.literacydirectory.org

You can check the box "Help with Reading and Writing", and put in a zip
code and mile radius to find nearby adult basic education programs and
their phone numbers. Many are free.

Without internet access, she could call her city's Department of Human
Services to find the same information.

Good luck!

Julie McKinney

 Thank you for your reply but let me clarify  my request, as I?m actually looking for different information.   The learner that I referenced in my previous request is actually  looking for resources that she can use to educate herself, and in turn,  educate her children on her own.  She is not interested in  participating in or attending any formal programs.  Do you have  any advice about information that I can share with her (for example,  internet sites with literacy lesson plans for adults/children,  reference books, etc.)?

Oh, that is different!

The ESOL Special Collection has online activitiesfor literacy learners.
It is geared to speakers of other languages, but they do have a good
selection of activtities that could be used by primary English speakers
as well.

www.eslcollection.org/ (Click the button for  Students/Learners)

The Family Literacy Special Collection also has nice activitites for
parents and children to explore to enhance literacy skills:

This is the Family Links Page (a better starting place for your caller):
http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/FamilyLit/parent_links.html

This is the home page:
http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/FamilyLit/index.html

You may also find good suggestions by asking on two other discussion
lists: Adult English Language Learners, and Family Literacy. This link
will take you to the other discussion lists:
http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/discussions.html

I would say, however, that someone with very low literacy skills would
find it very difficult to use these kinds of resources without any
guidance. She does sound like a very resourceful person, though, and I
wish her luck!

Julie

Hello Cesar,

If the person you describe is truly a nonreader, or having trouble  
with decoding and encoding, this will be tough to do entirely on her  
own. Would she be interested in a tutor?

There are computer programs that may assist her, but these are  
designed to be used with a tutor or teacher

? Language Tuneup kit
? Reading with Phonics
? Lexia Reading SOS
? Learning 100 (Steck Vaughn)
? Reading Horizons
? Academy of Reading
? My reading Coach

Descriptions of most of these will be found on my software list (soon  
to be updated) at http://newsomeassociates.com/ (Select Publications,  
then Adult Literacy Education Software Recommendations.)

Hello everyone: 

The Center for Adult English Language Acquisition (CAELA) published two
briefs in late 2005: Adolescent Learners in Adult ESL Classes and Online
Professional Development for Adult ESL Educators: 

 Adolescent Learners in Adult ESL Classes 
CAELA staff member Sarah Young has written a brief that explains some of
the reasons why adolescents may attend adult ESL classes and describes
the characteristics of adolescent learners. The brief also provides
guidelines for adult ESL program administrators, instructors, and
communities to improve adolescent ELL's chances of success in and beyond
adult ESL programs.  Download it at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/adolescent.html
<http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/adolescent.html> 

Online Professional Development for Adult ESL Educators 
This brief describes current efforts to provide online professional
development opportunities and resources for adult ESL teachers and
discusses factors that must be considered in the development, delivery,
and evaluation of professional development that is available online.This
brief is written by Karen Taylor technology manager at the Arlington
(Virginia) Education and Employment Program (REEP) and CAELA staff
member Julie Mathews-Aydinli. Download it at

While you're online at CAELA's Web site www.cal.org/caela

Hi All,

I'm happy to announce a Guest Speaker Discussion: February 15-22!

Please join us for a discussion with FOB author, Robin Schwarz. 
We will discuss her article in the most recent FOB:

"Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners" 
is about ESOL learners who seem "stuck", and how we can find the real
reasons for their struggles and find ways to get them back on track.

You can find this article at:
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=994

I'll post questions to think about on Tuesday, Feb. 7th, and the
discussion will start on Wednesday, Feb. 15th. We'll wrap up by the
following Wednesday. (I know that a Wed. to Wed. time frame is a little
odd, but we are trying it out to accommodate scheduling issues!)

I encourage you to re-read the article and start thinking about your
experiences with learners who have been "stuck", and the intake or
interviewing procedures that you use.

Robin Schwarz is an ESOL tutor, LD specialist and consultant in ESOL/LD
issues, and is a partner in the TLP Group in Columbus, Ohio. We are so
pleased to have her as guest speaker!

All the best,

Julie

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Discussion about Adolescent Language Learners
Message-ID: <s3e87162.091@mail.jsi.com>

Hi all, 
I'm passing on this announcement from Lynda Terrill about an upcoming
discussion on the Adult English Language Learners list:

The Adult English Language Learners is planning an online discussion on
adolescent learners in adult ESL/ESOL classes from February 8-14, 2006.
To join the English language list, please go to
http://www.nifl.gov/lincs/discussions/discussions.html and follow the
directions for subscribing.

*********

Adolescent English language learners (ELLs) are a growing population in
secondary schools and a steady presence in postsecondary (adult)
education programs. Many of you have experienced the unique
characteristics and needs that adolescent ELLs present in the adult ESL
classroom. Like their adult counterparts, some of these adolescents may
be undocumented or may not have high literacy or education levels in
their native languages. They may be trying to juggle work, education,
community, and family responsibilities both here and in their native
countries. Some may be struggling with cross-generational reunification
issues. Others may have been born and raised in the U.S. but failed to
succeed in traditional K-12 schooling. Despite their varied educational,
social, and cultural backgrounds, these adolescents have one thing in
common - their developmental stage and related needs may set them apart
from the adult students in your classes. 

As high school exit criteria grow more demanding in the United States,
students with limited or interrupted schooling are finding it difficult
to graduate within the timeframes traditionally allocated for high
school study. As a result, these students are turning to adult education
to earn high school diplomas, increase their job skills, and improve
their English language proficiency. On February 8-14 Sarah Young, author
of Adolescent Learners in Adult ESL Classes,
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/adolescent.html  will lead
a discussion and respond to questions about this topic. 

Sarah is an instructor at the Arlington Education and Employment Program
(REEP) in Arlington, Virginia. She is also an adult ESL content
specialist at the Center for Applied Linguistics where she works on
several projects related to adolescent and adult English language
learners.

On February 8, Sarah will summarize some of the issues related to
adolescents studying in adult ESL/ESOL classrooms (e.g., who these
learners are and why they are in adult ESL/ESOL classes, what
instructional strategies may work well with this population, what types
of educational opportunities may be available).

To review the topic before the discussion, please read brief (above),
which includes an extensive bibliography. 

We hope you will share your own experiences, advice, and comments,
before, during, and after the days that Sarah leads the discussion and
fields questions. 

If questions or comments are raised before next Tuesday, I will forward
them to Sarah. 

You may also send comments or questions to me off the list at

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Questions for Discussion of Struggling ESOL Learners
Message-ID: <s3e9a7f9.011@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All! 

Please remember that we are having a guest speaker starting next
Wednesday (Feb. 15th--the day after Valentine's Day).

Robin Schwarz, a longtime LD specialist, researcher and ESOL tutor, will
discuss her  recent article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL
Learners ", about ESOL learners who seem "stuck", and how we can find
the real reasons for their struggles and find ways to get them back on
track.

You can find this article at:
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=994

Following are some questions to think about as we prepare to discuss
this article. If you have staff meetings coming up, I encourage you to
use them as a chance to discuss the following questions as they relate
to your center or program.

Discussion Questions

1.  Stories:  Have you had struggling learners in your program? How
common do you think this problem is? Do you want to share a story of a
learner you have worked with, and tell us how you were able to find out
the issue, and what you did to help?

2.  Physical Disabilities:  How do we screen for them and what specific
accommodations can we make in the class or program for them?

3.  Intake/Counseling Procedures:  What does your center or program do
for a routine intake? What is the procedure to address a learner who is
not progressing? How well do you get at factors such as physical and
health problems, living situations, amount and nature of literacy
skills, nature of the primary language and cultural communication style?

4.  Responding: Once there is a reason discovered for a learner's
struggles, how well-equipped are you to respond to the problem? How do
you learn how to accommodate a hearing or visual problem? What do you do
for the learner with anxiety or depression? Do you have access to a
consulting teacher, or someone knowledgeable in the complexities of a
given culture's communication style (as in the example of the Sudanese
men in the article)? 

5.  Staff Training/Professional Development: What kind of training do we
all need in order to ensure that our intake procedures are complete and
appropriate? What kind of  training will help us to respond an effective
way?

6.  Did This Article Change Something You Do? Share with us anything
that you changed, did, started, or stopped as a result of reading this
article.  Why?  What result did you get?

7. What Connections Did You Make With This Article? Even if you did not
change anything, did it ring a bell or hit home to you in some way?

 We'll see you next week for the discussion!

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Welcome to our discussion with Robin Schwarz!
Message-ID: <s3f2e024.069@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,
Our discussion on Struggling ESOL Learners starts today, and here is an
introduction from our guest author, Robin Schwarz:

Hello to all those on the Focus on Basics discussion list.   
 
It is my great pleasure to be guest author this week in a discussion of
my article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners", which
appeared in the most recent issue of FOB.   As you can probably tell, I
am deeply devoted to these learners. Many remain my close friends. 
Their experiences constantly remind me that I must continue to urge
teachers and others who work with them to consider the broad range of
issues that these learners deal with in their lives and learning
efforts. 
 
My interest in sorting out the learning difficulties of English language
learners really took root when I was an ESL teacher in an Intensive
English Program ( IEP) in Washington, DC over 20 years ago.   I had
begun teaching English as a foreign language in West Africa with the
Peace Corps in the late 60's and early 70's ( yes, I am THAT old....) 
and continued as an ESL teacher in Washington after my return from
Africa. Besides teaching ESL in DC, I also pursued intensive training in
learning disabilities at a well-known diagnostic center  there and then
began teaching at the Lab School of Washington--first with younger
children and later in the Night School of the Lab School, which was one
of the first programs for adults with LD.   ( And where I hired Neil
Sturomski as a tutor--and later he hired me as a teacher!!) 
 
I had just completed a master's in LD when I started working with the
adults with LD and soon began noticing that many of the struggling
students in the ESL program where I worked in the daytime had problems
that closely resembled those of the adults with LD.  Wondering whether I
had missed that piece in my degree or in my ESL training, I soon
realized that the intersection of LD and second or foreign language
learning in adult learners was a much neglected topic.  Though there was
beginning to be a lot of focus on how to determime whether ELLs in K-12
had LD or not, virtually no work was being focused on post-secondary
ELLs. So I started learning what I could about all related topics. 
 
Throughout the  90's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work
with classes of ESL learners in our IEP who were at risk for failure and
was able to try out many methods and ideas that were being studied in
relation to American college students struggling in foreign language
classes.  I realized that the principles of foreign/other language
learning and the collision with apparent LD would be the same--and in
fact, that direction has led me to a great deal of research that has
been done about LD across languages and cultures.  Europe particularly
has focused on this topic and provided rich research for me from which
to learn.  
 
In 2000, I left Washington for Boston to pursue a doctorate in
education, focused on LD/ESOL, at Lesley University ( actually in
Cambridge).   Though I arrived convinced I could devise a test that was
more culturally and linguistically appropriate for identifying LD than
existing tools were, my doctoral studies soon led me to  realize that
the issues were indeed as complex as I had thought when I first began my
interest in this topic.  Encounters with learners such as the ones
described in my article convinced me that no single test could reveal
these issues.  I learned that many ELLs in adult ESOL or adult education
were being perceived as having learning difficulties or even learning
disabilities, when in fact other issues were the cause of their
problems.   Since I turned in that direction, I have deepened my
knowledge of how culture impacts adult learners-- both their culture and
ours-- how first language issues make learning English more complicated
than we expect, how the learner's level of literacy impacts acquiring
literacy in a new language, and how dyslexia, when in fact it IS
present, appears across languages.    
 
Wherever I go to do workshops and presentations about the factors that
impact ELLs, people confirm that the wide range of obstacles for their
learners:   
 
An LD specialist in the midwest, attempting what I had wanted to do
earlier--test ELLS for LD-- has found that low literacy renders even
"non-verbal" tests useless and that despite having been deemed to have
adequate oral skills for testing, those who were very culturally
different were extremely reticent in a testing situation.  
 
A teacher in California realized that her students kept doing poorly in
her writing class because they had never heard of the notion of a main
idea and another, herself from South America, enthusiastically agreed
that time notions were very different in her country.  
 
A high-level official in adult education in a southwestern state,
himself a Navajo,  confirmed that the Navajo do not even have words for
"learning disabilities,"   and another worried that the school board
governing the schools on a reservation would not be excited about a new
way to identify learning challenges among the adult learners in their
community. 
 
Two Colombian doctors who were my students in Massachusetts were able to
explain that the teacher expectations they had encountered in their
conversation classes in a proprietary ESL school  in Boston were very
different from what they had known and were confusing to them. 
 
And on and on.   Every week I learn more about these challenges and
renew my efforts to understand them and communicate them to teachers and
programs.  

I look forward to discussing YOUR experiences with and questions about
adult ESOL learners who struggle to learn.  
 
Robin Schwarz

Hi All,
I have two questions, one for Robin and one for list members. 

Robin, in your article you concluded that staff training is one of the ways to ensure that learners' needs are understood and, one hopes, appropriately addressed. Given the limited pre-service training time most ESOL programs have, what one or two things would you suggest programs focus on with NEW teachers, vis-a-vis "the variety of noneducational issues that can impede learning"? Can you direct us to any particular resources that are helpful? 

List colleagues, what training or orientation, if any, does your program give or did you get as a new teacher (or a teacher new to that institution?) to prepare you to address these issues? Can you share any particular resources that were helpful?

Regards,
Barb Garner

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Welcome to our discussion with Robin Schwarz!

Hi All,
Our discussion on Struggling ESOL Learners starts today, and here is an
introduction from our guest author, Robin Schwarz:

Hello to all those on the Focus on Basics discussion list.   
 
It is my great pleasure to be guest author this week in a discussion of
my article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners", which
appeared in the most recent issue of FOB.   As you can probably tell, I
am deeply devoted to these learners. Many remain my close friends. 
Their experiences constantly remind me that I must continue to urge
teachers and others who work with them to consider the broad range of
issues that these learners deal with in their lives and learning
efforts. 
 
My interest in sorting out the learning difficulties of English language
learners really took root when I was an ESL teacher in an Intensive
English Program ( IEP) in Washington, DC over 20 years ago.   I had
begun teaching English as a foreign language in West Africa with the
Peace Corps in the late 60's and early 70's ( yes, I am THAT old....) 
and continued as an ESL teacher in Washington after my return from
Africa. Besides teaching ESL in DC, I also pursued intensive training in
learning disabilities at a well-known diagnostic center  there and then
began teaching at the Lab School of Washington--first with younger
children and later in the Night School of the Lab School, which was one
of the first programs for adults with LD.   ( And where I hired Neil
Sturomski as a tutor--and later he hired me as a teacher!!) 
 
I had just completed a master's in LD when I started working with the
adults with LD and soon began noticing that many of the struggling
students in the ESL program where I worked in the daytime had problems
that closely resembled those of the adults with LD.  Wondering whether I
had missed that piece in my degree or in my ESL training, I soon
realized that the intersection of LD and second or foreign language
learning in adult learners was a much neglected topic.  Though there was
beginning to be a lot of focus on how to determime whether ELLs in K-12
had LD or not, virtually no work was being focused on post-secondary
ELLs. So I started learning what I could about all related topics. 
 
Throughout the  90's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work
with classes of ESL learners in our IEP who were at risk for failure and
was able to try out many methods and ideas that were being studied in
relation to American college students struggling in foreign language
classes.  I realized that the principles of foreign/other language
learning and the collision with apparent LD would be the same--and in
fact, that direction has led me to a great deal of research that has
been done about LD across languages and cultures.  Europe particularly
has focused on this topic and provided rich research for me from which
to learn.  
 
In 2000, I left Washington for Boston to pursue a doctorate in
education, focused on LD/ESOL, at Lesley University ( actually in
Cambridge).   Though I arrived convinced I could devise a test that was
more culturally and linguistically appropriate for identifying LD than
existing tools were, my doctoral studies soon led me to  realize that
the issues were indeed as complex as I had thought when I first began my
interest in this topic.  Encounters with learners such as the ones
described in my article convinced me that no single test could reveal
these issues.  I learned that many ELLs in adult ESOL or adult education
were being perceived as having learning difficulties or even learning
disabilities, when in fact other issues were the cause of their
problems.   Since I turned in that direction, I have deepened my
knowledge of how culture impacts adult learners-- both their culture and
ours-- how first language issues make learning English more complicated
than we expect, how the learner's level of literacy impacts acquiring
literacy in a new language, and how dyslexia, when in fact it IS
present, appears across languages.    
 
Wherever I go to do workshops and presentations about the factors that
impact ELLs, people confirm that the wide range of obstacles for their
learners:   
 
An LD specialist in the midwest, attempting what I had wanted to do
earlier--test ELLS for LD-- has found that low literacy renders even
"non-verbal" tests useless and that despite having been deemed to have
adequate oral skills for testing, those who were very culturally
different were extremely reticent in a testing situation.  
 
A teacher in California realized that her students kept doing poorly in
her writing class because they had never heard of the notion of a main
idea and another, herself from South America, enthusiastically agreed
that time notions were very different in her country.  
 
A high-level official in adult education in a southwestern state,
himself a Navajo,  confirmed that the Navajo do not even have words for
"learning disabilities,"   and another worried that the school board
governing the schools on a reservation would not be excited about a new
way to identify learning challenges among the adult learners in their
community. 
 
Two Colombian doctors who were my students in Massachusetts were able to
explain that the teacher expectations they had encountered in their
conversation classes in a proprietary ESL school  in Boston were very
different from what they had known and were confusing to them. 
 
And on and on.   Every week I learn more about these challenges and
renew my efforts to understand them and communicate them to teachers and
programs.  

I look forward to discussing YOUR experiences with and questions about
adult ESOL learners who struggle to learn.  
 
Robin Schwarz

Hi All,

Robin will be checking in at lunchtime, let's put something out here to
share with her.

Some ideas: 
   * answer Barbs question about the training you received as a new
teacher
   * address one of the discussion question (see below)
   * ask Robin one question

Thanks,
Julie

Discussion Questions

1.  Stories:  Have you had struggling learners in your program? How
common do you think this problem is? Do you want to share a story of a
learner you have worked with, and tell us how you were able to find out
the issue, and what you did to help?

2.  Physical Disabilities:  How do we screen for them and what specific
accommodations can we make in the class or program for them?

3.  Intake/Counseling Procedures:  What does your center or program do
for a routine intake? What is the procedure to address a learner who is
not progressing? How well do you get at factors such as physical and
health problems, living situations, amount and nature of literacy
skills, nature of the primary language and cultural communication style?

4.  Responding: Once there is a reason discovered for a learner's
struggles, how well-equipped are you to respond to the problem? How do
you learn how to accommodate a hearing or visual problem? What do you do
for the learner with anxiety or depression? Do you have access to a
consulting teacher, or someone knowledgeable in the complexities of a
given culture's communication style (as in the example of the Sudanese
men in the article)? 

5.  Staff Training/Professional Development: What kind of training do we
all need in order to ensure that our intake procedures are complete and
appropriate? What kind of  training will help us to respond an effective
way?

6.  Did This Article Change Something You Do? Share with us anything
that you changed, did, started, or stopped as a result of reading this
article.  Why?  What result did you get?

7. What Connections Did You Make With This Article? Even if you did not
change anything, did it ring a bell or hit home to you in some way?

Hi All,
I have two questions, one for Robin and one for list members. 

Robin, in your article you concluded that staff training is one of the
ways to ensure that learners' needs are understood and, one hopes,
appropriately addressed. Given the limited pre-service training time
most ESOL programs have, what one or two things would you suggest
programs focus on with NEW teachers, vis-a-vis "the variety of
noneducational issues that can impede learning"? Can you direct us to
any particular resources that are helpful? 

List colleagues, what training or orientation, if any, does your program
give or did you get as a new teacher (or a teacher new to that
institution?) to prepare you to address these issues? Can you share any
particular resources that were helpful?

Regards,
Barb Garner

Hi Robin.
It's wonderful to gain your insight here. I'm looking forward to
hearing your thoughts on the LD/ESOL connections.

In my work, I've seen
a plateau effect in native-English speaking low-literacy learners we discussed
about a year ago on this board. We captured a lot of that on the ALE Wiki
and explored some of the rationale. Many confirmed that for some reason the
NSE (native speakers of English) learners get stuck at a second or third grade
level and don't get past that point to become true readers, winding up in
decoding-ville with minimal comprehension.

I'd suspect that learning disabilities
play in here too. Some of what I've found in my research on metacognition
and the NSE low-literacy learners implicates the learners' concepts about
reading and I think that's a factor too. You mentioned your Navaho contact
not having a word for learning disabilities. I wonder if some of the ESOL
learners have trouble with the conceptualization of the reading process too.
We work with a population of recently immigrated older Liberian women with
no schooling at all, and find that there are so many assumptions in American
culture that they have no concept of. 

I wonder if the conceptualization
of the reading process has some implications for your populations too.

Message-ID: <005b01c63254$6149b560$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

If you administer an adult education program, you face a wide variety of challenges:

*         How can you help students make "level" gains?

*         How can you help students gain the skills they need to reach their goals?

*         How can you help students stay in programs long enough to meet their goals?

*         How can you prepare and retain good teachers?

*         How can you document the successes of your program?

 

The National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) conducted research relevant to these questions. The Program Administrators? Sourcebook (December 2005) is designed to give you, as a program administrator, direct access to research that may help you address the challenges you face in your job.

 

Written by Jackie Taylor, Cristine Smith, and Beth Bingman in collaboration with five local program administrators, this sourcebook presents NCSALL?s research findings in short sections related to key challenges that program administrators face in their work as managers of adult education programs. It also presents the implications of these research findings for program structure and services, as well as some strategies for implementing change based on these implications.

Robin

I am in Washington DC and I am working with a large number of adult
immigrants with very limited academic background and in many cases
illiterate.

I have many questions but I would like to focus on two burning questions at
this time:

1) Where can we draw the line between illiteracy and learning disability?

2) Is it pedagogically sound to teach how to read and to write in their
native language before attempting to teach English as a second language?

Thank you for your thoughts and ideas.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20060215144716.03226d00@pop.utk.edu>

Greetings all,

While reading Robin's article- "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL 
Learners", I was struck by the discussion about Surer and issues around 
pre-literacy skills.  I took an ESL instructional course
a few years ago at the University of Tennessee where the topic of teacher 
preparation for teaching handwriting was raised.  And most of the articles 
I found in looking into that topic indicated that many instructors did not 
feel prepared to provide that type of instruction.

But what I also discovered in the process, was some suggestions and ideas 
to guide instructors.
For example:
- Collect writing samples for analysis (level appropriate)
- Observe students as they write. What to look for: grip, posture, slant, 
wrist stability, eye-hand coordination, hand dominance
- Plan for teaching interventions such as:
--Practice script: Lined/unlined paper, Letter formation- Direction, 
Starting/ending point, Spacing, Size, Connections
-- Modeling
-- Integrated Approaches:
a) Practice handwriting within context- Use authentic materials, Practice 
has a purpose such as letter to a friend or taking a phone message
b) Utilize other skills: Reading left to right, Write on board or vertical 
surface, Use math, art, games, and other activities or manipulatives
c) Mix of explicit and integrated approaches

Yet the overall question this raised for me was- is there a connection 
between the reluctance of some ESOL learners to write partly connected to 
pre-literate skills such as handwriting in the English language??

The training I received as a new teacher did not touch on issues of
learning disability in our ESL learners.  

I am now working in South Dakota, designing teacher training modules for
new ESL adult ed teachers, and we are concerned that we at least touch
on this issue of how teachers can help struggling learners.  I think it
might best be tied in with assessment, and ongoing assessment.  New
teachers perhaps can be thoroughly immersed in the idea that they need
to assess and later re-assess their learner's needs and progress all
along the way.   

You have to beware of overload in new teacher training, however.  They
can only absorb so much in one sitting.  Perhaps this topic is best
dealt with after 6 months or even 1 year of teaching, in a continuing
training for new teachers.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Welcome to our discussion with Robin Schwarz!

Hi All,
Our discussion on Struggling ESOL Learners starts today, and here is an
introduction from our guest author, Robin Schwarz:

Hello to all those on the Focus on Basics discussion list.   
 
It is my great pleasure to be guest author this week in a discussion of
my article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners", which
appeared in the most recent issue of FOB.   As you can probably tell, I
am deeply devoted to these learners. Many remain my close friends. 
Their experiences constantly remind me that I must continue to urge
teachers and others who work with them to consider the broad range of
issues that these learners deal with in their lives and learning
efforts. 
 
My interest in sorting out the learning difficulties of English language
learners really took root when I was an ESL teacher in an Intensive
English Program ( IEP) in Washington, DC over 20 years ago.   I had
begun teaching English as a foreign language in West Africa with the
Peace Corps in the late 60's and early 70's ( yes, I am THAT old....) 
and continued as an ESL teacher in Washington after my return from
Africa. Besides teaching ESL in DC, I also pursued intensive training in
learning disabilities at a well-known diagnostic center  there and then
began teaching at the Lab School of Washington--first with younger
children and later in the Night School of the Lab School, which was one
of the first programs for adults with LD.   ( And where I hired Neil
Sturomski as a tutor--and later he hired me as a teacher!!) 
 
I had just completed a master's in LD when I started working with the
adults with LD and soon began noticing that many of the struggling
students in the ESL program where I worked in the daytime had problems
that closely resembled those of the adults with LD.  Wondering whether I
had missed that piece in my degree or in my ESL training, I soon
realized that the intersection of LD and second or foreign language
learning in adult learners was a much neglected topic.  Though there was
beginning to be a lot of focus on how to determime whether ELLs in K-12
had LD or not, virtually no work was being focused on post-secondary
ELLs. So I started learning what I could about all related topics. 
 
Throughout the  90's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work
with classes of ESL learners in our IEP who were at risk for failure and
was able to try out many methods and ideas that were being studied in
relation to American college students struggling in foreign language
classes.  I realized that the principles of foreign/other language
learning and the collision with apparent LD would be the same--and in
fact, that direction has led me to a great deal of research that has
been done about LD across languages and cultures.  Europe particularly
has focused on this topic and provided rich research for me from which
to learn.  
 
In 2000, I left Washington for Boston to pursue a doctorate in
education, focused on LD/ESOL, at Lesley University ( actually in
Cambridge).   Though I arrived convinced I could devise a test that was
more culturally and linguistically appropriate for identifying LD than
existing tools were, my doctoral studies soon led me to  realize that
the issues were indeed as complex as I had thought when I first began my
interest in this topic.  Encounters with learners such as the ones
described in my article convinced me that no single test could reveal
these issues.  I learned that many ELLs in adult ESOL or adult education
were being perceived as having learning difficulties or even learning
disabilities, when in fact other issues were the cause of their
problems.   Since I turned in that direction, I have deepened my
knowledge of how culture impacts adult learners-- both their culture and
ours-- how first language issues make learning English more complicated
than we expect, how the learner's level of literacy impacts acquiring
literacy in a new language, and how dyslexia, when in fact it IS
present, appears across languages.    
 
Wherever I go to do workshops and presentations about the factors that
impact ELLs, people confirm that the wide range of obstacles for their
learners:   
 
An LD specialist in the midwest, attempting what I had wanted to do
earlier--test ELLS for LD-- has found that low literacy renders even
"non-verbal" tests useless and that despite having been deemed to have
adequate oral skills for testing, those who were very culturally
different were extremely reticent in a testing situation.  
 
A teacher in California realized that her students kept doing poorly in
her writing class because they had never heard of the notion of a main
idea and another, herself from South America, enthusiastically agreed
that time notions were very different in her country.  
 
A high-level official in adult education in a southwestern state,
himself a Navajo,  confirmed that the Navajo do not even have words for
"learning disabilities,"   and another worried that the school board
governing the schools on a reservation would not be excited about a new
way to identify learning challenges among the adult learners in their
community. 
 
Two Colombian doctors who were my students in Massachusetts were able to
explain that the teacher expectations they had encountered in their
conversation classes in a proprietary ESL school  in Boston were very
different from what they had known and were confusing to them. 
 
And on and on.   Every week I learn more about these challenges and
renew my efforts to understand them and communicate them to teachers and
programs.  

I look forward to discussing YOUR experiences with and questions about
adult ESOL learners who struggle to learn.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Making connections with struggling learners
Message-ID: <s3f35ab4.032@mail.jsi.com>

Aaron's thoughts about how pre-literacy skills (or lack of them) can
affect learners made me think back to some learners I've worked with. I
was trying to remember how it came out that they were not literate in
their first language, or that their first language was not a written
one.

A woman from Nigeria came to mind...she was outgoing, bold, and funny
and spoke very well, but her writing skills were far behind her speaking
skills. I noticed it in terms of her handwriting, spelling, and ability
to put her thoughts on paper. When we started talking about her writing,
she told me that that she had no literacy skills until she came to the
U.S. as a young adult, and the whole concept of writing was new to her.
It was her open personality that made it easy for her to tell me this.
If she was a quieter, more private person, or less articulate in
English, it would have been much harder to figure out.

So my question for Robin and others out there is: How can we make
connections with people to get at the root of these issues without
pushing too much and overstepping our role. A person's personality is
one among many factors that we have to consider in order to follow the
best approach. Robin's article gave some good information about asking
privately and gently, and I would love to expand on that and ask for
more advice.

Missy,
I agree, the question of overload is always one to consider. 
Would it be worth including Robin's article in a packet of reading material packet for your new teachers? A set of articles they might read on their own, when they get a chance...?

The training I received as a new teacher did not touch on issues of
learning disability in our ESL learners.  

I am now working in South Dakota, designing teacher training modules for
new ESL adult ed teachers, and we are concerned that we at least touch
on this issue of how teachers can help struggling learners.  I think it
might best be tied in with assessment, and ongoing assessment.  New
teachers perhaps can be thoroughly immersed in the idea that they need
to assess and later re-assess their learner's needs and progress all
along the way.   

You have to beware of overload in new teacher training, however.  They
can only absorb so much in one sitting.  Perhaps this topic is best
dealt with after 6 months or even 1 year of teaching, in a continuing
training for new teachers.

Hi All,

Robin will be checking in at lunchtime, let's put something out here to
share with her.

Some ideas: 
   * answer Barbs question about the training you received as a new
teacher
   * address one of the discussion question (see below)
   * ask Robin one question

Thanks,
Julie

Discussion Questions

1.  Stories:  Have you had struggling learners in your program? How
common do you think this problem is? Do you want to share a story of a
learner you have worked with, and tell us how you were able to find out
the issue, and what you did to help?

2.  Physical Disabilities:  How do we screen for them and what specific
accommodations can we make in the class or program for them?

3.  Intake/Counseling Procedures:  What does your center or program do
for a routine intake? What is the procedure to address a learner who is
not progressing? How well do you get at factors such as physical and
health problems, living situations, amount and nature of literacy
skills, nature of the primary language and cultural communication style?

4.  Responding: Once there is a reason discovered for a learner's
struggles, how well-equipped are you to respond to the problem? How do
you learn how to accommodate a hearing or visual problem? What do you do
for the learner with anxiety or depression? Do you have access to a
consulting teacher, or someone knowledgeable in the complexities of a
given culture's communication style (as in the example of the Sudanese
men in the article)? 

5.  Staff Training/Professional Development: What kind of training do we
all need in order to ensure that our intake procedures are complete and
appropriate? What kind of  training will help us to respond an effective
way?

6.  Did This Article Change Something You Do? Share with us anything
that you changed, did, started, or stopped as a result of reading this
article.  Why?  What result did you get?

7. What Connections Did You Make With This Article? Even if you did not
change anything, did it ring a bell or hit home to you in some way?

Hi All,
I have two questions, one for Robin and one for list members. 

Robin, in your article you concluded that staff training is one of the
ways to ensure that learners' needs are understood and, one hopes,
appropriately addressed. Given the limited pre-service training time
most ESOL programs have, what one or two things would you suggest
programs focus on with NEW teachers, vis-a-vis "the variety of
noneducational issues that can impede learning"? Can you direct us to
any particular resources that are helpful? 

List colleagues, what training or orientation, if any, does your program
give or did you get as a new teacher (or a teacher new to that
institution?) to prepare you to address these issues? Can you share any
particular resources that were helpful?

Regards,
Barb Garner

Hi All,
Our discussion on Struggling ESOL Learners starts today, and here is an
introduction from our guest author, Robin Schwarz:

Hello to all those on the Focus on Basics discussion list.   
 
It is my great pleasure to be guest author this week in a discussion of
my article, "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners", which
appeared in the most recent issue of FOB.   As you can probably tell, I
am deeply devoted to these learners. Many remain my close friends. 
Their experiences constantly remind me that I must continue to urge
teachers and others who work with them to consider the broad range of
issues that these learners deal with in their lives and learning
efforts. 
 
My interest in sorting out the learning difficulties of English language
learners really took root when I was an ESL teacher in an Intensive
English Program ( IEP) in Washington, DC over 20 years ago.   I had
begun teaching English as a foreign language in West Africa with the
Peace Corps in the late 60's and early 70's ( yes, I am THAT old....) 
and continued as an ESL teacher in Washington after my return from
Africa. Besides teaching ESL in DC, I also pursued intensive training in
learning disabilities at a well-known diagnostic center  there and then
began teaching at the Lab School of Washington--first with younger
children and later in the Night School of the Lab School, which was one
of the first programs for adults with LD.   ( And where I hired Neil
Sturomski as a tutor--and later he hired me as a teacher!!) 
 
I had just completed a master's in LD when I started working with the
adults with LD and soon began noticing that many of the struggling
students in the ESL program where I worked in the daytime had problems
that closely resembled those of the adults with LD.  Wondering whether I
had missed that piece in my degree or in my ESL training, I soon
realized that the intersection of LD and second or foreign language
learning in adult learners was a much neglected topic.  Though there was
beginning to be a lot of focus on how to determime whether ELLs in K-12
had LD or not, virtually no work was being focused on post-secondary
ELLs. So I started learning what I could about all related topics. 
 
Throughout the  90's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work
with classes of ESL learners in our IEP who were at risk for failure and
was able to try out many methods and ideas that were being studied in
relation to American college students struggling in foreign language
classes.  I realized that the principles of foreign/other language
learning and the collision with apparent LD would be the same--and in
fact, that direction has led me to a great deal of research that has
been done about LD across languages and cultures.  Europe particularly

On the one hand, yes, overload is a concern.  but are there also ways to
begin to integrate awareness of issues around LD and reading difficulties
from the get go, without waiting for the big LD workshops?

Barb,

While Robin's article is extremely informative and worth having at my
fingertips, I've found that giving teachers too much to consume, even at
their leisure, is truly an overload.  I am the lead ESL instructor in
charge of curriculum development and staff development meetings at a
technical college in Gwinnett County, and I particularly like the idea
of having a continuing training for new teachers.  At each of our
quarterly staff development meetings, one of the items on the agenda is
a break-out session for teachers at different levels.  Incumbent
teachers get to share their experiences with new teachers.  I give them
discussion questions to cover in their groups, and then they share what
they've discovered with the rest of the staff.  Many of our teachers are
retired elementary school teachers or current ESOL teachers.  They
absolutely love sharing their classroom challenges and ideas with each
other in small groups.  

I'll certainly add Robin's article to one of my staff development
agendas.

T. McKelton

Hugo,

1.     Illiteracy vs. LD
I teach Beg. ESL to recently arrived, mostly illiterate Latino students.  In my experience the lack of literacy emerges quite early- at the introduction of the alphabet and spelling of names or noticing a student has difficulty holding a pen or pencil.

Recognition of LD or handicaps tends to take  longer.  At times another student  has informed me of a classmate's difficulty.
Students seem more willing to admit illiteracy than LD/ handicap.  It is often a problem to locate needed services for students because of their lack of insurance or legal status.

2.   Given the time and the resources to teach literacy skills in the student's native language is sound practice.  Literacy in the first language facilitates literacy in the second.

The NIFL-ESL list has been discussing pre-literate learners and has included
some tremendous resources some of you might not have seen. I've copied and
pasted the posts with some of the links to save you search time.

A test!
I'm not sure of the alphabetical order rationale in here, but this is short
and sweet and free:
>From Charles Larue
Developed with a grant from the MN
Dept of Education: The LaRue Literacy Skills Test  http://www.mcedservices.com/PDFs.html

and Pre-Literacy Exercises are available free online.

>From Pauline Mcnaughton

The Canadian Language Benchmarks:  ESL for Literacy Learners (adults) which
starts out at the Foundation Level with the assumption that learners have
never even held a pencil.
http://www.language.ca/display_page.asp?page_id=255


>From Shash Woods
Tacoma Community House Training Project in Tacoma, Washington
has developed a booklet called "Making It Real" that is a guide to teaching
adult pre-literate refugees. While it does not deal with early literacy for
children, it is a useful resource for teaching adults. The book contains a
wealth of information on techniques and activities and a checklist and resource
section. You can download it for free from http://www.tchtrainingproject.com


>From Marian Burt
In fact, in  Practitioner Toolkit: Working with Adult
English Language Learners, the National Center for Family Literacy along with
the Center for Applied Linguistics published a guide for those working specifically
with adults learning to read who are not native English speakers - discussing
the role of phonological processing, vocabulary knowledge, syntactic processing,
and background knowledge. In section II, pages 57 -59, these skills are discussed.
Then, on pages II- 60 -61, pre-reading activities to use with pre-literate
and nonliterate English language learners are described. (The next pages have
activities to use with beginning level learners, intermediate, and advanced).
You can download the toolkit in PDF at http://www.cal.org/caela/tools/instructional/prac_toolkit.html

Hi All-- sorry I did not catch up with the discussion earlier-- I am 
not using the list and messages correctly I fear, because the e-mail on 
my computer does not work and replying directly is impossible-- I have 
to jump to my other e-mail systems. But here is an attempt to get in 
and answer a few questions about non-literate learners and reading in 
first language. These were answers posted on the NIFL=ESL discussion 
list a week or so ago--the same questions came up there. This question 
was from a director of an ESL program in DC:?
?
Is there any research on teaching?
Adult LD or illiterate students in their own language for a semester or 
100 hours, before?
immersion into English???? Basically, if the student learns how to read 
and write and/or?
decode in their language, is that a benefit to them in their process of 
learning English????
?
Here are my responses to that question: -?
There is literature about that advantage. Many recommend that literacy 
happen in first language, if at all possible. The transferability of 
phonological skills that accrue through gaining literacy is considered 
to be very high. Thus becoming literate in one language supports 
gaining literacy in another--College students who start a foreign 
language in college are expected in two semesters (roughly 160 hours of 
instruction) to be able to converse at about SPL 3 ( basic 
conversations about everyday topicsthat are reasonably grammatically 
correct), read literature in that language and write brief compositions 
in that language. Compare that with the progress of someone who has low 
level literacy--or none at all-- in 160 hours of instruction.......The 
outcome would be very different.?
?
However, if the language of the student is an unwritten language (e.g. 
Dinka --a language spoken by many Sudanese) literacy would have to 
develop in a second language anyway.--the Sudanese usually speak Arabic 
or Kiswahili --some very fluently). It would presumably be better for 
that person to attempt literacy in his or her strongest language, as 
literacy requires a vocabulary of, I believe David Rosen said, roughly 
3,000--5,000 words --something many ESOL learners might be a long time 
acquiring.?
?
Basic literacy in any language is supported by phonological skills: 
phonological awareness, underlying literacy skills, and phonological 
memory, underlying aural/oral skills ( listening and speaking). Thus 
those skills must be verified to be strong in an adult that is becoming 
literate. These are pre-literacy skills--not directly related to 
text--the kind of skills nursery rhymes were intended to support in 
English. It is a sense of the sound chunks of a given language ( i.e. 
words, syllables--and sometimes discrete phonemes, though actual 
phoneme awareness in an alphabetic language takes exposure to print.) 
and how these chunks can be manipulated. In English, phonological 
awareness includes an awareness of rhyme. It also includes awareness of 
tone and pitch and other non-language sounds ( suprasegmentals). These 
are the skills the huge majority of children come to school with, or 
had well-developed before they were exposed to print concepts. In the 
researchi on reading difficulties ( dyslexia ) phonological awareness, 
has been found to be the basic skill needed for literacy--which is why 
it is so difficult for dyslexics to master reading--they are known to 
have difficulties with phonological awareness. Therefore, if it is not 
well?
developed, a learner will have enormous difficulty in becoming 
literate.?
?
*************************************************?
Another list question had to do with whether learning "fractured 
grammar" in one language would result in fractured grammar in another:?
?
Since understanding and mastering grammar is dependent on good 
phonological skills (remember the manipulating of chunks part-- moving 
or adding words, syllables or sounds to new meanings is what we 
describe as grammar-) then it is a universal skill and not a 
language-specific one. The field of second language acquisition does 
not consider that interference of one's first language with the new 
language is anything other than a normal language learning stage. If 
having fractured grammar in one language would lead to the same thing 
in the new language, then the opposite could also be presumed to be 
true. But having perfect grammar in one language does not guarantee 
having perfect grammar in the new language--if phonological awareness 
is fundamentally weak but that weakness was overcome through repetition 
and practice in one language, it will raise its ugly head when a new 
language is encountered. Think how many high school and college 
students who fail miserably at learning a foreign language even though 
they are highly literate in their first language. I know I have at 
least one person like that in every audience I address, large or small. 
? In fact, it was that very phenomenon--very bright college students 
unable to learn foreign languages--which launched research into how 
dylexia impacts foreign language learning.?
?
*******************************************************?
Still another question was what to do if learners wanted to learn 
English and not become literate in their own language:?
?
As for learners not wanting to become literate in their first language, 
it is their choice, not ours. But as always, we want it to be an 
informed choice. They should be helped to truly understand that it is 
probably actually a shorter route to English literacy to start with 
first language literacy. And becoming literate in their language 
doesn't have to mean they are barred from English classes--where a lot 
of other kinds of literacy-- signage, labels on groceries, directions 
on commeon objects--can take place. And of course, their becoming 
literate in their first language means being taught literacy by someone 
literate in it....which could be a challenge for many programs--finding 
someone literate enough and trained to teach it.?

I don't want to forget to mention the amazing Emily Griffiths 
Opportunity School in Denver. This is a century-old ESL school for 
adults that has a large program for non-literate refugees. They do a 
wonderful job--and when I visited in November, the director described a 
program for non-literate Somali women that was highly successful in 
getting the women to speak, read and write English--very gradually and 
gently. Perhaps someone can contact the school and find out more about 
how they do it.?
?
Thinking about the writing question also made me think of the Sudanese 
I have worked with and another cultural issue--I think I mentioned that 
in the article-this was the situation where the learners were not 
interested in answering what they considered to be obvious 
-ridiculous??--questions. When given a different set of prompts about 
topics they were interested in, they did very well.?
?
?And finally, I cannot emphasize often enough how important it is to be 
sure your adult learners can SEE. Adult ESOL learners typically do not 
give vision care very high priority-- yet many have vision challenges. 
It is very hard to write clearly and form letters accurately if you 
cannot see. Wherever possible I urge that you facilitate eye exams--and 
urge the optometrist to check for binocularity problems as well as 
acuity problems. Binocularity is the ability to focus both eyes on one 
object and keep them there--then move them smoothly together. A 
suprising number of adults who struggle to read and write have this 
problem. To help your learners in the meantime, provide colored paper 
to write on, and larger than usual figures to copy or trace. The 
reduced glare and larger figures make it easier to see to write.?

Message-ID: <8C800C3895EF946-17D8-412@MBLK-M21.sysops.aol.com>




As I indicated in my opening message, distinguishing LD in ESOL 
learners has been my focus and specialty since about 1985--the more I 
learn about this, the less I know. What I know at this point, as my 
article was intended to illustrate, is that there are many other 
legitimate issues that impede learning progress in adult ESOL learners 
( and younger ones, too, for that matter.) These issues are given short 
shrift by inexperienced or unaware ESOL teachers and other teachers who 
do not know about second language acquisition, low literacy 
implications, cultural differences and their impact, etc.?
?
Where once I felt that LD issues were rather common among ESOL 
learners, I now think they are no more common than they REALLY are in 
adult learners in this country-- though there is now a strong belief 
that the incidence is high, my experience and recent work has led me to 
believe there are many other issues causing difficulties for adult 
learners: vision, visual stress syndrome ( difficulty with light 
sensitivity and looking at black print on white paper), hearing, 
health, attention problems, etc.?
?
In the ESOL learners, what emerged as signficant barriers to learning 
were weaknesses in core phonological skills, as mentioned in an earlier 
post, and problems with actual discrimination of sounds in English. It 
is perfectly normal for the adult brain to have more difficulty 
perceiving sounds of a new language accurately--and those who are 
monolingual may have even more difficulty than those who are already 
multilingual ( though I do not wholly agree with the contention of some 
in linguistics that speaking multiple languages automatically precludes 
difficulty in hearing a new language accurately--again, I have ample 
anecdotal evidence to know that, like any other generalization, is not 
true--though may be true more often than not)?
?
When I have put heavy emphasis in my teaching on the drilling of 
hearing fine differences in sounds -- minimal pairs such as bit/bet or 
sheep/cheap or feet/ Pete--- or tap/tab -- I find that my students' 
aural comprehension soars and then their ablitiy to hear and remember 
the language accurately also soars--and then reading comes along much 
better, too.?
?
I use a book called Pronunciation Contrasts in English, by D L. F. 
Nilsen and A. P. Nilsen. To my knowledge, it has been recently 
reprinted-- it is a book of all the minimal pairs in English-- and each 
page includes a diagram of the mouth for each sound, plus a list of all 
the languages for which that contrast is a a difficulty. I cannot 
recommend it enough. If you contact me off-list, I can forward my 
handout on drilling these pairs.--thge book does not have drills per 
se.?
?
As for phonological skills, as mentioned in that earlier post, I find 
it is essential that core phonological awareness be strong before 
literacy is attempted. I cannot recommend enough screening this skill ( 
can the learner hear rhymes ( once the concept is explained) ?) Can the 
learner count the number of words in a sentence s/he hears? If these 
skills are weak, they must be addressed. People with true dyslexia have 
great difficulty hearing and producing rhyme and have been repeatedly 
shown in studies to have significant weaknesses in phonological 
awareness in general. This skill PRECEDES phonemic awareness--which in 
English comes later, as literacy begins to develop. ?Just bear in mind 
the progression of skills that children go through before they begin to 
read. Children are not aware of single sounds in words until they are 
first aware of the larger chunks of language. ( And don't forget that 
many language on the planet are NOT alphabetic, and therefore do not 
have phonemes per se. If your learner's language is like this, then the 
very concept of phonemes and letter sounds has to be approached quite 
differently than it would be for a learner from an alphabetic language. 
)?
?
Phonological MEMORY supports the learning of new vocabulary and 
language strings-- idioms and syntax, etc. If your learner cannot 
repeat a sentence of more than 3 or four words completely accurately, 
this skill should be targeted through activities in counting words in 
sentences and saying them accurately-- gradually increasing the length 
of sentences repeated, etc. I am constantly challenged in this by 
people saying that if you know the language you can repeat the 
sentences. But actually, a person with good phonological memory can do 
this relatively easily without any idea of what s/he is saying. This 
skill is tested in the native language by using nonsense words (see a 
test like the C-TOPP --Comrpehensive TEst of Phonological Processing 
Skills) for example. ) It is irrelevant to test nonsense words for ESOL 
learners, since a foreign language is ipso facto nonsense words until 
one learns a lot of vocabulary. Just try it with low frequency words-- 
words we rarely use in conversation.?
?
This skill can be so weak as to constitute a learning 
disability--though it is not classified as such. Phonological awareness 
weaknesses, on the other hand, are known to be at the heart of 
dyslexia--and so ARE LD-- except that we need to have attempted to 
strengthen awareness in a new language before deciding that it is a 
disability---. It is possible to determine in first language that there 
is a reading disability, but it requires having the correct tools to do 
it-tests of reading nonsense words in that language and other tasks 
that test core phonological awareness and speed of decoding. The usual 
tools for diagnosing LD in English do not work with non-native English 
speakers, except those tests of phonological awareness, and then we 
have to be careful that the tests are not weighted to English speakers.?
?
This is getting long-- sorry for so much information-- I guess this 
will overload a lot of people. But since these are the core skills 
needed for language learning and reading, it seems awfully important 
that teachers know about them and understand what challenges are likely 
plaguing their adult learners who are stuck.?
?
More tomorrow on reasons why those readers may plateau at 3rd or 4th 
grade. Robin?

Subject: writing and handwriting for low literate /non-literate learners

This is in response to Aaron's and others' comments and questions on 
teaching writing to low or non-literate learners.?
?
Though this is an area I am not so well acquainted with, here are some 
observations and thoughts:?
?
AS for phonological skills, the skill of handwriting requires roughly 
the same preparation that young children get before they are expected 
to write easily-- lots and lots of fine motor practice-- the muscles 
for holding a writing instrument must be developed and the movements 
developed from large to small. When remediating these skills in persons 
with dysgraphia, it is necessary to start with large arm movements, 
creating circles and other letter-related movements on the board or on 
newspaper with markers ( pens , especially most ball point pens, are 
slippery for those with hand writing challenges--plus the added tactile 
input of markers is helpful in teaching the fingers to grasp 
correctly.) Fat pens or pencils would be helpful in the beginning-- or 
fat markers.?
?
Much tracing experience is recommended--plus other kinds of activities 
that involve fine motor with a writing tool-- mazes, connecting dots, 
coloring---all the things children do to strengthen their fingers and 
hands.?
There is an amazing choice of "adult" coloring books-- lovely designs, 
pictures from different cultures, etc--usually available through 
museums- ( does anyone know the name of that company that produces 
those in great profusion?? They must be available on the web).?
?
There are a VERY few books for non-literate adult ESOL learners that 
include some basic tracing of letter forms, but to my highly 
opinionated view, they have far too little practice in them. Like all 
skills, these must be mastered-- overlearned-- for further writing to 
develop comfortably. Also bear in mind that for those with dyslexia and 
dysgraphia, cursive is highly recommended over block printing. Thus it 
will undoubtedly be easier for those learning to write for the first 
time to move directly to connected writing and curvy lines rather than 
straight interrupted lines. A friend of mine in the DC area, Janette 
Haynes produced a wonderful handwriting book for adult ESOL learners 
coming from other alphabets-- it was called American Handwriting Slow 
and Easy and was a simplified cursive system. (Delta Publishing 
Systems, 1995) My Arabic college students found this very helpful--it 
has practice with check writing, names of states, different names for 
streets, cardinal and ordinal numbers, etc--all things ESOL learners 
need to learn anyway, instead of meaningless sentences.?
?
As for those who write already, here is where my culture alarms go off. 
? Many other cultures have a very different approach to writing than we 
do . For example, in the French=based system I taught in in Africa, 
students were obliged to have "perfect" handwriting at a very early 
age. They had a much different formation of letters than we do--and 
they were severely punished if their writing was not neat and beautiful 
and if they misspelled ANYTHING. Thus learners coming from such 
cultures may be extremely hesitant to write in English, a) because they 
do not know how to form the letters the way we do and b) because they 
fear being reprimanded for making errors. As Dave Barry would say, I am 
NOT making this up. In my class of adult ESOL learners in Massachusetts 
I encountered this very situation. These were mostly learners from Cape 
Verde and Brazil, Haiti and different African countries. When I gave 
them some task to write and hardly anyone moved their pencil, I asked 
them whether they were afraid I would be mad if they made spelling 
mistakes or wrote badly= they ALL nodded vigorously. I had to assure 
them repeatedly I was not going to look at those things!!!?
?
And finally, looking further to actual composition--again culture is a 
huge obstacle. How text is organized for writing varies enormously from 
culture to culture--in some it is considered rude to make a point 
explicitly. It is up to the reader to figure it out. In other cultures 
it is important to write EVERYTHING you know about a topic-- and these 
do not understand why we get so exercised about their voluminous 
compositions that appear to us to ramble all over the place. ?As I have 
said many times in my trainings, the concept of main idea in writing 
does not exist much beyond our borders. This was confirmed by my next 
door neighbor here in Columbus, where I live now== she is Romanian, and 
a doctoral student. She told me she also had a terrible time figuring 
out how to write in the highly linear way we do in America, --a thought 
seconded by my Portugues doctoral advisor at Lesley. She said she had 
to teach herself how to write " just the important points" when she was 
a newly arrived college student from Portugal.?

Hi All,

Robin gave us a lot to absorb, and a lot of specifics to try to
incorporate into teaching and teacher training. It would be helpful to
share ideas and resources that can help with the specific suggestions
she recommended. (Thanks, Jean, for pulling those other resources from
the ESL discussion for us!)

Does anyone know of resources to share in the following areas:

* phonological awareness: how to assess and how to practice
* phonological memory: how to assess and practice
* tracing/handwriting or other fine-motor practice for adults
* the world's languages and cultures--is there a resource to help us
learn about a language (is it written? type of approach to writing?) and
culture (communication style?) I'm thinking about the Sudanese men and
what would we do if there's no expert available...

Hello!
Here are a couple of resources I have used to look up languages, 
language structure, history etc...

This link covers many languages but the information on each is brief, 
location, # of speakers  and sometimes but not always, whether it is 
written or not.
http://www.ethnologue.com/   

This information about each language is a lot more in -depth ( /its 
history, status, sound system, grammar, vocabulary, writing and much 
more../.)
 than in  the previous link  but  it covers fewer languages.   It also 
gives a lot  of references for further research.

http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/languageList.html

I have consulted both links about Mayan ( we have a few Mayans in our 
program) and  learned a lot through the second link

Enjoy,

Julie and all -- I think CAELA and especially NCELA have some good 
resources on culture and languages.  The Office of Refugee Concerns has 
booklets on many cultures---tomorrow I will add some titles of books 
that have helped me with this topic.

Phonological awareness may not be listed per se as a skill to practice, 
but if one googles "phonemic awareness"  there is a LOT there on 
practicing the kinds of skills that build UP to phonemic awareness and 
phonological memory.   One artilce that really covers the whole topic 
well and offers great suggestions for activities is

" How Now Brown Cow: Phoneme Awareness Activities for Collaborative 
Classrooms" by Patricia J. Edelen-Smith.     I found it on the web--iIt 
was published in Intervention in School and Clinic in 1997Vol 33 #2

Hi Robin,

Interesting point about prevalence of vision problems.  What proportion of 
your students have this would you say?

I found this with Google, suggesting 3-5% might have a certain type of 
binocularity problem called "convergence insufficiency" which would affect 
their reading.
http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic553.htm

However it is rare in children, so would hardly ever be a cause for a person 
not to have been able to learn to read as a child.

Is this "convergence insufficiency" the kind of problem you are finding, or 
are other problems more common?

Cheers from Chiswick.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] Fwd: Three more thoughts on writing




I don't want to forget to mention the amazing Emily Griffiths
Opportunity School in Denver. This is a century-old ESL school for
adults that has a large program for non-literate refugees. They do a
wonderful job--and when I visited in November, the director described a
program for non-literate Somali women that was highly successful in
getting the women to speak, read and write English--very gradually and
gently. Perhaps someone can contact the school and find out more about
how they do it.

Thinking about the writing question also made me think of the Sudanese
I have worked with and another cultural issue--I think I mentioned that
in the article-this was the situation where the learners were not
interested in answering what they considered to be obvious
-ridiculous??--questions. When given a different set of prompts about
topics they were interested in, they did very well.

And finally, I cannot emphasize often enough how important it is to be
sure your adult learners can SEE. Adult ESOL learners typically do not
give vision care very high priority-- yet many have vision challenges.
It is very hard to write clearly and form letters accurately if you
cannot see. Wherever possible I urge that you facilitate eye exams--and
urge the optometrist to check for binocularity problems as well as
acuity problems. Binocularity is the ability to focus both eyes on one
object and keep them there--then move them smoothly together. A
suprising number of adults who struggle to read and write have this
problem. To help your learners in the meantime, provide colored paper
to write on, and larger than usual figures to copy or trace. The
reduced glare and larger figures make it easier to see to write.

Thanks to Robin for hosting this discussion.  I have no answers to specific
questions posed this week, but I feel a need to use this forum to express my
frustration and sense of helplessness.  I hope you will indulge me.  I have
12 years of ESOL experience, in a great variety of settings, and a master's
in ESOL. In July 2002, I took a position in correctional education, teaching
beginning ESOL to male inmates in a large county facility in Massachusetts
that is well-known for its education program.  When I came here, I had no
training or experience in working with special-needs students.  Yet, as you
all probably know, a great percentage of incarcerated adult students have
learning issues. Many of the ESOL students here are nonliterate in their
first language, which in this case is Spanish.  It is difficult to know,
when a nonliterate inmate comes through orientation, why he can't read
because we have no screening protocols.  He simply gets placed in the
beginners class. (This is if his oral SPL is 0 to 2; if he can communicate
at an intermediate level but can't read, that's another challenge that we
cannot meet.) In rare cases, such as that of Rodolfo, a 21-year-old from
Guatemala, the student simply had not been to school. I initially thought
Rodolfo had LDs. In addition to being nonliterate, he seemed unable to
produce oral language. But over time I discovered that Rodolfo lacked
confidence and self-esteem. Eventually, he began speaking (with excellent
pronunciation).  As for reading, early on I had little success using a
phonics approach. Then I discovered that he was very good at word
recognition in context. 

In most cases, however, there are issues of LDs, head injuries, substance
abuse, childhood trauma, low intelligence, etc. Take Anibal (age 30) or Jos?
and Hector (both in their late 50s): After months of school, despite
individual work with a peer tutor (inmate) and one-on-one tutoring from me
when I could manage it, they still could not read a simple word.  Since I've
been here, I have attended several workshops on learning disabilities,
including an excellent one presented a year ago by Robin herself at this
facility.  But I am far from a trained reading specialist. And I cannot even
apply what I have learned so long as the special-needs students are
integrated with beginning learners who are literate in L1 and may even have
high school diplomas.  Yes, I can provide things like Irlen overlays. But we
do not have the resources to creat special-needs ESOL classes. So most of
these men sit and do busywork or, when possible, work on computer software.
With intensive tutoring, they might be able to learn. But under these
circumstances, they make little or no progress, and because they are
mandated to be in school, they take spaces in class that could go to
students with greater learning potential. So this is my frustration. I'm not
trained to teach a large number of our ESOL students, and even if I were,
limited resources prevent delivering what they need. I feel that I'm burning
out and question the value of what I'm doing.  Perhaps teachers in other
kinds of adult programs face the same issues.

I also work with beginning learners, most of whom are refugees. Like most  
programs, even if one of my students were diagnosed with some learning  
disabilites, we don't have the resources to make much difference.
I have a student from Cambodia. She has good speaking skills but can not  
read or write.  She has never been to school either in Cambodia or the  US.  I 
have a retired special ed. teacher who works with her twice a  week.  She really 
isn't making much progress and is losing  confidence.  Her work has told her 
that she must learn to read so she  really feels the pressure.
My biggest puzzle is a woman from Guadalupe.  She has been in the US  for 
over 10 years and is married to an American.  She speaks French with  the 
occasional English word thrown in.  After 20 plus years of marriage to  an American, 
three English speaking kids and many ESL classes, she still doesn't  speak 
English. However, she can read and write in English.
I think she comes to class for the relationships and I'm happy to have her  
there.

Iris,
You are not alone.I too am a corrections educator. You described a 
similar situation to what I see in my job in VT, a simply huge variety 
of abilities and levels. Your situation sounds a bit more complicated 
than mine because the vast majority of my students are able to speak 
English.

I think that the hardest cases for me are when traumatic brain injuries 
co-mingle with chronic drug and alcohol abuse. It is so unpredictable 
what kinds of learning problems these individuals may experience.

It sounds like you are extremely frustrated with your work with the 
offenders. If you are given freedom to develop the education program 
where you work, you might look at it as a wonderful opportunity to 
create a system that works for your guys where nothing has ever worked 
before.

Ten things I've learned as I helped build our high school, the Community 
High School of Vermont, are:
1. You can't help everybody.
2. Everyone comes to you at his own level and works at his own pace.
3. Some problems of individuals are bigger than education.
4. It is best to have no expectations for your students, not low 
expectations. No expectations.
5. Appreciate whatever gains might be made, no matter what they may  be.
6. Every student is good at something.
7. Students have to direct the course of their education. Teachers 
assist them.
8. Don't try doing it the other way around or you will fail miserably 
and drive all your students away.
9. You may not know when you will gain a new student or lose an old 
student so your classes have to be self-standing, not dependent on a 
sequence of classes the student may have missed.
10. These things motivate learners. and a motivated learner cannot be 
stopped. He will learn more than you ever thought possible, learning and 
emotional disabilities become irrelevant.

Best wishes,
Tom Woods

Sandy, Iris and others who work with such learners:  This is what I 
meant by the necessity of checking and addressing core phonological 
skills.   These are NOT phonics or other text-related skills, but those 
that are the foundation of language and language acquisition.

In the case of these learners who cannot seem to learn to read and 
write, go back and look at my comments about checking their 
phonological awareness.   If they cannot HEAR that words rhyme --and 
feel free to ask someone who speaks the language to explain the concept 
to them if you feel they do not get it-- and if they cannot count the 
words in sentences they can say, you will know that there is some very 
fundamental work to be done.   There appears to be no way to short cut 
these needs nor hurry up the acquisition of them.  These folks will 
need extended work in those two skills before literacy skills will 
begin to emerge.   All the research tells us that if they do not have 
these very fundamental understandings of how the chunks of language 
work, they will not be able to make much progress with the notion of 
assigning symbols to the chunks ( in the case of English--letters 
representing sounds).

10-15 minutes per day doing a wide variety of activities around rhyming 
and around word counting should begin to make a chink in this wall.   
Be careful to keep ALL activities non-text related--use only pictures, 
objects for rhyming and abstract forms to count words --if you know 
anything about or can get information about the LIPS program of the 
Lindamood-Bell approach, that is what it is designed to do--build 
pre-text phonological skills, though I don't think it specifically 
stresses rhyme.

Activities for rhyme can be first just matching a set of pictures-- 
have available about 12 sets , but vary the sets worked with each day 
to preclude the memory factor. Use about 4 sets per day.   Then this 
activity can be expanded to determine which 2 of 3 rhyme;  then if the 
sense appears to be emerging, have several pictures that have one rhyme 
(cat, mat, hat, bat)  and have the learner sort two of these sets.   
Make a sort of wheel--with one key word in the middle, and places to 
place the rhyming pictures around it for one manipulative activity.   
Use wall pockets to sort rhyming pictures by pairs, then by groups as 
the skill grows. Using pictures or ojects have the learner move around 
the room to find them, or to place the pairs together. Complete body 
involvement will be helpful.  Do not tackle two-syllable rhymes until 
the rhyme concept has happened.   You have to believe me that using 
print will only confuse the issue until it has emerged as an oral/aural 
skill.    It may take many sessions for this skill to begin to emerge.  


Word games or very short poems that can be learned can be  used to 
begin to help the learner pay attention to rhyme.   Use nursery 
rhymes--two line ones-- for the learner to complete-- give tokens for 
each one completed correctly ( ORALLY ONLY!!)
Eg.  Hickory, Dickory Dock, the mouse ran up the ____?   The learner 
says CLOCK-- and gets a token.   Aim for one or two tokens per 
session--then three, then four, etc.

Use Shel Silverstein and other highly rhymed poetry also--have the 
learner begin to predict what kind of word will complete the couplet or 
rhyme.

For word counting, first have the learner literally WALK the words in a 
sentence by laying out colored squares of carpet or paper fastened to 
the floor and having him/her repeat the sentence as they walk on the 
squares.   YOu might be really surprised to see how hard this will be 
for them at first.  Continue with similar full-body activities until 
they can say and count four-word sentences well.  Keep a graph or 
record of progress so they can see this--it will be unlike anything 
else they have gotten credit for.  Don't mix in syllables at this 
point.

As for the rhyme, spend only a few minutes a session on this-- it will 
not be effective if the learner's brain is tired--and that fatigue 
happens quickly in a foreign language.

If there is someone who can do these kinds of activities with the 
learners in their first language--especially the word counting-- the 
idea will transfer a bit more readily, I would predict.   The Spanish 
speakers, Iris, should be able to understand the concept of rhyme in 
Spanish with some help from a classmate or teacher who speaks Spanish,  
If there is such a person available, by all means let the learner do 
these activities in Spanish, and then see if the awareness can be 
transferred to English--all without print, as I keep saying.

Once the rhyming gets stronger, you can move to identification of 
initial sounds of words--again assuring total mastery and again, 
reviewing rhyme every other session.   I know with the learners I have 
done rhyme with, it grew in strength very gradually, and review was 
helpful to maintain it.

At the point where first letter sound becomes a strong skill, you can 
begin to introduce letters that produce that sound.   Then you can 
begin to use children's type very early phonics books to give you ideas 
of how to proceed.

As word counting becomes literally easy, then you can move to syllable 
counting-- I find that leap is not very hard- again using the first 
language if the concept can be explained in it.

Again, Google phonemic awareness, and you will get a whole panoply of 
sources with activities for pre-phoneme phonological awareness that can 
be readily adapted to your situations.

Let me give thoughts on the lady from Guadalupe in a second response so 
this doesn't go on too long.

The Cambodian lady has what amounts to dyslexia--though how you would 
get that diagnosed as such is another problem.   In any case, it is 
time for some pretty strong advocacy on your part to her employer 
telling the company or manager or whoever that it is unrealistic to put 
any time limit on her learning English as that is not a time-able 
activitiy.   If anyone is willing to vouch, besides me, that this IS in 
fact, a LD, then unless her job truly requires reading and she was 
hired without reading, there may be solid grounds for a discrimination 
compl aint if the insistence on reading in a certain time persists 
despite your advocacy...

This kind of demand usually comes from ignorance about the language 
acqusition process and obstacles to it. Obviously the lady WANTS to 
learn English or she wouldn't be in your program.

I hope this is helpful.    Robin

I also work with beginning learners, most of whom are refugees. Like 
most programs, even if one of my students were diagnosed with some 
learning disabilites, we don't have the resources to make much 
difference.
I have a student from Cambodia. She has good speaking skills but can 
not read or write.? She has never been to school either in Cambodia or 
the US.? I have a retired special ed. teacher who works with her twice 
a week.? She really isn't making much progress and is losing 
confidence.? Her work has told her that she must learn to read so she 
really feels the pressure.
My biggest puzzle is a woman from Guadalupe.? She has been in the US 
for over 10 years and is married to an American.? She speaks French 
with the occasional English word thrown in.? After 20 plus years of 
marriage to an American, three English speaking kids and many ESL 
classes, she still doesn't speak English. However, she can read and 
write in English.
I think she comes to class for the relationships and I'm happy to have 
her there.

This is for Sandy and Iris --and the mothers on the NIFL LD list of 
those students having such a hard time learning a foreign language in 
school--

Sandy- the lady from Guadalupe is a glowing example of how phonological 
skills can be separate completely-- a phenomenon noted early on in the 
LD/ Foreign/second language literature I referred to in my very first 
communication to this discussion.  If any of you is interested in 
research on this, look up the works of Leonore Ganschow and Richard 
Sparks ( the latter of Mount St. Joseph's college of Ohio).  They have 
written about 100 articles related to foreign language learning and 
learning disabilities.  Many of the recent ones address the topics 
Glenn wrote about--how colleges decide on a waiver etc. and the need 
for really good foreign language instruction.

It is fascinating to me that the world of foreign language difficulties 
and LD have agreed for a long time that some students will do better if 
they can do only one aspect of language-- either listening as speaking 
or reading and writing.   The University of Colorado at Boulder, for 
example, used to--and may still- offer Spanish conversation for those 
whose phonological memory skills were strong but whose phonological 
awarenness was weak ( i.e. speaking and listening skills were strong, 
but reading and writing were weak)   The opposite set of skills, what 
Sandy's lady from Guadalupe exhibits-- strong phonological awareness 
--reading and writing skills, but weak phonological memory-  difficulty 
in acquiring oral/aural skills- was addressed by offering these 
students Latin class, where they didn't have to listen to and pronounce 
the language much at all.   There is, in fact, a fairly robust body of 
literature about offering Latin to students with LD for that very 
purpose.    Funny, isn't it, that TESOL and ESOL teachers' training 
never seems to address that split........?

I worked with a doctor from Colombia with this latter problem-- he 
could--can-- read literally better than I can-- he reads medical texts 
in English at lightning speed and reads the New York Times for 
enjoyment--but he was unable to understand the simplest conversation in 
English or produce grammatically correct or comprehensible sentences 
orally.   He tested as having somewhat weak  phonological memory 
skills--but these were impacted by the strong interference of Spanish 
and by his inability as an adult learner of English to discriminate 
English sounds and words accurately.   Intensive work on minimal pairs 
to help him hear the fine differences more accurately, work on hearing 
and reproducing words in sentences extremely accurately plus a lot of 
expliciti instruction in how English phonology works--that is, how 
stress works, how we run together words in sentences
(as in connecting the regular past tense to following words:  She 
dropped it--becomes "she drop  tit " in speech )  helped him immensely. 
  He now speaks rather deliberately but can apply the rules of English 
grammar very accurately  and speaks in slow but completely 
comprehensible and correct sentences.

A phenomenon noted in research also affected this man-- though he was 
highly literate in English and Spanish, he still applied Spanish 
phonics--sound-symbol correspondences-- to English and so was forever 
puzzled by the resulting mangled words.    This is apparently not an 
uncommon tendency in persons coming from highly regular writing 
systems--they do not consciously notice that English is NOT regular and 
continue to try to apply a regular system to it.

A system I learned from a great friend who is an ESOL teacher for 
having learners sort words in readings by vowel sounds helped the 
doctor enormously in that problem, as well.  My friend uses a grid with 
the 10 basic vowel sounds--long and short, plus the vowel plus 
diphthongs (in English phonics, but they don't need that term)  ( oy, 
ow as in cow) /aw/, and r controlled vowels, --then the students take a 
list of words -- use one-syllable to start with-- and sorts them into 
these boxes.   This helps them see the many spellings of long o, for 
example, or that the other big variety of spellings all have one 
sound-- /aw/ as in paw, call, wasp, etc.   ( this is the phenomenon 
that the program called, I think, Phonographics addresses----that one 
thing can be represented in many ways--as the word flower represents a 
huge variety of things we call flowers; or chair refers to a huge 
variety of seating---in the same way,  long o can be represented in 
writing in many different ways-- a concept children and adults alike 
readily understand once it is explicitly taught to them as such. )

For your student, Sandy, I would recommend some intensive work of the 
sort I just suggested-- work on minimal pairs to hear English sounds 
accurately ( contact me off list for my drill procedure for this) and 
previously I recommended a book called Pronunciation Contrasts in 
English by Nilsen and Nilsen. I have been told it has been recently 
reprinted.

For helping student hear words in sentences accurately, I think a book 
called "Listening Dictation"-which used to be on every ESL program's 
shelves-- may still be available through e-bay or google-- it is by 
Joan Morley, a person who truly understood the listening needs of 
English language learners.   It has lessons designed to help learners 
hear specific words and structures in sentences and to pay attention to 
prepositions and other small words that learners of English tend to 
miss.   It addresses all four skills, too, listening, speaking, writing 
and reading.  It is a marvel of effectiveness, I have always found.

Also for students like yours, and for the others working on 
pre-literacy phonological and listening discrimination skills, books 
and CD's designed for pre-reading listening would be great.    These 
are ESL materials designed to help learners learn the names of things, 
listen for differences such as plurals, the difference between these 
and those and other critical oral information. They have only pictures 
and then a script or a CD with spoken lessons for doing the activities 
related to the pictures.

Caution: I used to recommend books on tape to these learners--but found 
out from my Colombian doctor, who had a work ethic that was  
breathtaking and a drive to learn English that was staggering, that all 
the listening in the world didn't help him understand them easily.    
The speed of the langauge on the tapes was WAY beyond him--no matter 
how simple the content.   ESL materials, on the other hand, will be 
designed to avoid that problem.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] a lament

Thanks to Robin for hosting this discussion.  I have no answers to 
specific
questions posed this week, but I feel a need to use this forum to 
express my
frustration and sense of helplessness.  I hope you will indulge me.  I 
have
12 years of ESOL experience, in a great variety of settings, and a 
master's
in ESOL. In July 2002, I took a position in correctional education, 
teaching
beginning ESOL to male inmates in a large county facility in 
Massachusetts
that is well-known for its education program.  When I came here, I had 
no
training or experience in working with special-needs students.  Yet, as 
you
all probably know, a great percentage of incarcerated adult students 
have
learning issues. Many of the ESOL students here are nonliterate in their
first language, which in this case is Spanish.  It is difficult to know,
when a nonliterate inmate comes through orientation, why he can't read
because we have no screening protocols.  He simply gets placed in the
beginners class. (This is if his oral SPL is 0 to 2; if he can 
communicate
at an intermediate level but can't read, that's another challenge that 
we
cannot meet.) In rare cases, such as that of Rodolfo, a 21-year-old from
Guatemala, the student simply had not been to school. I initially 
thought
Rodolfo had LDs. In addition to being nonliterate, he seemed unable to
produce oral language. But over time I discovered that Rodolfo lacked
confidence and self-esteem. Eventually, he began speaking (with 
excellent
pronunciation).  As for reading, early on I had little success using a
phonics approach. Then I discovered that he was very good at word
recognition in context.

In most cases, however, there are issues of LDs, head injuries, 
substance
abuse, childhood trauma, low intelligence, etc. Take Anibal (age 30) or 
Jos?
and Hector (both in their late 50s): After months of school, despite
individual work with a peer tutor (inmate) and one-on-one tutoring from 
me
when I could manage it, they still could not read a simple word.  Since 
I've
been here, I have attended several workshops on learning disabilities,
including an excellent one presented a year ago by Robin herself at this
facility.  But I am far from a trained reading specialist. And I cannot 
even
apply what I have learned so long as the special-needs students are
integrated with beginning learners who are literate in L1 and may even 
have
high school diplomas.  Yes, I can provide things like Irlen overlays. 
But we
do not have the resources to creat special-needs ESOL classes. So most 
of
these men sit and do busywork or, when possible, work on computer 
software.
With intensive tutoring, they might be able to learn. But under these
circumstances, they make little or no progress, and because they are
mandated to be in school, they take spaces in class that could go to
students with greater learning potential. So this is my frustration. 
I'm not
trained to teach a large number of our ESOL students, and even if I 
were,
limited resources prevent delivering what they need. I feel that I'm 
burning
out and question the value of what I'm doing.  Perhaps teachers in other
kinds of adult programs face the same issues.

Wow-- I really have to object to some of the things in this 
message--particularly number 1 and number 4!!  Yes you CAN help 
everybody-- it depends on what you mean by "help"-- in fact, some of 
the other points contradict this one, because if you hand over learning 
decisions--paired with really good information on what is holding the 
learner up, the learner will ipso facto be "helped" to see that they 
can indeed learn.    And as for having "no expectations"--that sounds 
like the results of having one's own expectations of learners 
disappointed.    Again, it depends on how the expectations are framed.  
If they are framed in terms of teachers' expectations, of course they 
will not be met as we want. If they are framed in terms of doing 
whatever it takes to help a learner learn to learn, then the learner's 
expectations of being able to learn can be readily addressed.

I expect that every learner who has made it to my setting WANTS to 
learn--and I will do whatever I can to help learning happen-- I do NOT 
have expectations of how much or how soon-- I ALWAYS have expectations 
that learning will happen--EVERYONE can learn SOMETHING--it is NOT our 
job to decide what that will be or how it will be learned--but ours to 
help the learner make what they want happen or understand more about 
how it realistically has to happen.

As I have tried to point out to the NIFL lists before, it is incredible 
how much about adult learners' learning barriers can be discovered by 
careful screening and by helping learners learn how to learn, one tiny 
step at a time.  There is a LOT of literature about how the 
metacognitive skills of learners of the type Tom has described in 
earlier messages have never been developed because of the stress, 
physical violence and other dilfficult situations they come out of.  
Therefore, one thing we CAN do as teachers is help these learners learn 
about themselves and about how learning happens in tiny increments by 
guiding them through a consistent process designed to build these 
metacognitive skills.

The teaching processes described in the previous two lessons have 
worked for me and other teachers because they addressed real needs of 
learners and because they presumed no learning until it was 
demonstrated.  I find in my work that extremely often learners are 
presumed to be unable to learn but in fact, teachers are starting too 
high and not taking into account very basic learning needs of these 
learners.  Too many assumptions are made about foundation skills--both 
linguistic and basic skills needed for learning-- and about learners' 
having the necessary "school" skills-- being able to see, process 
visual information in the way we expect, process auditory information 
adequately, copy information, pay attention etc. .  When these skills 
are not firm and then combined with underdeveloped learning in the neo 
cortex and frontal lobes,  of course learning will seem impossible both 
to learner and teacher.

There are extremely effective ways available to evaluate and address 
these needs and skills and then help even the most challenged learner 
begin to find ways to learn.

Hi Robin,

Interesting point about prevalence of vision problems.  What proportion 
of
your students have this would you say?

I found this with Google, suggesting 3-5% might have a certain type of
binocularity problem called "convergence insufficiency" which would 
affect
their reading.
http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic553.htm

However it is rare in children, so would hardly ever be a cause for a 
person
not to have been able to learn to read as a child.

Is this "convergence insufficiency" the kind of problem you are 
finding, or
are other problems more common?

Cheers from Chiswick.

I don't want to forget to mention the amazing Emily Griffiths
Opportunity School in Denver. This is a century-old ESL school for
adults that has a large program for non-literate refugees. They do a
wonderful job--and when I visited in November, the director described a
program for non-literate Somali women that was highly successful in
getting the women to speak, read and write English--very gradually and
gently. Perhaps someone can contact the school and find out more about
how they do it.

Thinking about the writing question also made me think of the Sudanese
I have worked with and another cultural issue--I think I mentioned that
in the article-this was the situation where the learners were not
interested in answering what they considered to be obvious
-ridiculous??--questions. When given a different set of prompts about
topics they were interested in, they did very well.

And finally, I cannot emphasize often enough how important it is to be
sure your adult learners can SEE. Adult ESOL learners typically do not
give vision care very high priority-- yet many have vision challenges.
It is very hard to write clearly and form letters accurately if you
cannot see. Wherever possible I urge that you facilitate eye exams--and
urge the optometrist to check for binocularity problems as well as
acuity problems. Binocularity is the ability to focus both eyes on one
object and keep them there--then move them smoothly together. A
suprising number of adults who struggle to read and write have this
problem. To help your learners in the meantime, provide colored paper
to write on, and larger than usual figures to copy or trace. The
reduced glare and larger figures make it easier to see to write.

John--  as I have pointed out on other lists,  the company I work for 
has data showing that in the population of adult learners identified as 
having a high risk of some serious learning barrier (using a widely 
known and used tool which is a list of 13 questions that were deemed 
sensitive to indicating the presences of some learning barrier or 
other)  50% had vision problems that were uncorrected --including the 
convergence insufficiency--which we call binocularity difficulties, I 
believe (a partly scientific term, I acknowledge).  We have a tool to 
screen for binocularity problems as well as for distance and near point 
acuity.

More prominent however, is a problem your British colleagues call 
visual linked stress syndrome (known here as scotopic sensitivity or 
the Irlen syndrome.) My business partner just spent a week in January 
consulting with four different researchers in Britain about their 
findings and methods of identifying this and about its relationship to 
what you call convergence insufficiency.   In our data, 85% of the 
learners, who were all dentified as struggling to learn (according to 
that screening tool mentioned above),  had this problem.   It is helped 
by use of colored overlays or colored lenses.  The British researchers 
have variously developed a diagnostic process on a computer or with 
lights or another device to identify it and to measure the outcomes 
that change with use of lenses and overlays.  Two of them have 
developed a rather efficient way for having adults choose lenses to 
help those who are significantly affected -- more than just reading.    
One of these researchers is one of the world's leading voices on 
binocularity problems and contends that visual linked stress syndrome 
may be the real reasons many of our learners appear to have 
binocularity problems.  In any case, there is mounting evidence that 
this syndrome has very profound effects on the brain and all it 
processes.

We continue to accrue more data on these learners and this problem-- it 
is undeniable and profound for many.   It does not affect only poor 
readers. We continue to encounter persons who would be considered 
unimpaired because they have graduated from college but who, in fact, 
confess to being highly reading-aversive--they do not read unless they 
absolutely have to because reading is so uncomfortable.  Given 
overlays, these persons, too, become avid and fluent readers.   One 
person we screened in NM reported two months later that though he had 
literally gone from 2nd grade through college without ever reading a 
book because his compensatory skills were so highly developed, he now 
reads 3-5 books PER WEEK and adores reading.    The stories of their 
struggles in school are heart rending because no one believed them when 
they said things moved on the page and reading gave them headaches and 
other physical symptoms.

The easiest way to know that reading problems likely stem from 
visual-related difficulties is if the person can actually decode single 
words effectively --proivded font is large and not on white paper.   If 
they can do that, but cannot read text well or for longer than a few 
minutes without beginning to make a lot of errors such as dropping 
words or lines, losing their place easily, using a finger or pointer to 
read, guessing words or leaving off parts of words , substituting 
letters and words, and read very haltingly, then visual problems must 
be very strongly suspected.  Clearly they have mastered the 
sound-symbol association process but cannot attain fluent reading.    
As noted earlier, these people will almost always tell you that things 
move if shown that in fact, they do NOT move.   We recently screened a 
36 year-old lady-- an 8th grade dropout who was diagnosed as having LD 
in 2nd grade.  She did NOT report that things moved--but when given an 
overlay, looked up in surprise and said that the lines stopped 
swirling-- she said she had never known that they were NOT supposed to 
move.   Her 9-year old daughter had identical symptoms and also 
reported that words and lines stopped "sliding off the page"  and 
disappearing--she was already in remedial reading for her halting and 
inaccurate reading, and like many others, when asked, reported that her 
eyes watered and burned and that she got headaches from reading.   With 
her overlays (she chose two--one color over the other),  she read 
adult-level material fluently.

This puts an awful lot of conclusions about reading fluency outcomes 
and other reading problems in question.......

Message-ID: <8C80302864BF8C9-171C-C004@FWM-D07.sysops.aol.com>

Hi --this is in response to the person from Oregon or Washington and to 
Janet Isserlis on another list, both of whose topic was teacher 
professional development and the fear of overloading teachers with 
information.

This topic is near and dear to my heart.  As I indicated in another 
posting today, it is surprising to me that the field of ESL does not 
seem to prepare teachers for the sort of really hard-core learning 
problems that several readers and responders have mentioned.

In another message on one of the NIFL lists the notion of profesisonal 
development qualification standards for teachers in adult education was 
mentioned.

Frankly, what I often see is that it is too common that teachers in 
adult education and adult ESOL education are woefully unqualified to do 
what they do.   Then learners suffer.   My article in FOB indicated 
that in some of those cases, teachers were simply not prepared to ask 
the right questions or to consider the key issues in adult ESOL 
learners' situations that significantly impact the learners' progress 
in their settings.

Those of you who know me, know that I get pretty passionate on this 
topic.  I believe, as do my business partners, Laura Weisel and Al 
Toops, we are supposed to be in business for the learners, not for the 
tutors and teachers in our programs.  In other words, it is not the 
needs and limitations of the teachers or tutors that should drive 
decisions or policies about how our programs run but rather the needs 
of our learners.  I have advocated for years that there need to be 
minimal qualifications for hiring teachers or tutors to teach adult 
ESOL learners.  I can write an entire book-- and someday will-- of 
stories like those in the article where the learner was somehow blamed 
for no progress when in truth the learner's teacher had no idea how to 
address the learner's real needs.

I agree strongly with Janet that it is essential that the nature of 
learning challenges-- of all kinds, including language learning 
challenges-- be constantly put out to teachers and required reading for 
them.    Though I am sure no program is going to fire its tutors 
because I say so, I certainly hope you will consider a far more 
stringent approach to requiring that those already in your employ 
inform themselves about adult learners and adult ESOL learning,  about 
the very most basic principles of language instruction,  about the 
culture of their learners. etc.    Also, program administrators have 
everything to gain by requiring more training for tutors and better 
experience and qualifications for teachers.  In the end, they will be 
more effective and programs with have better outcomes.  The NCSALL 
research project on learner persistence (2005 --at NCSCALL.net) 
indicated that when tutors were better trained, not only were learners 
happier and tended to persist longer, but tutors also persisted because 
they did not feel so helpless in helping those with significant 
learning needs.

Somewhere recently I saw reference to the suggestion or proposal that 
adult education teachers be subject to qualification much as K-12 
teachers are.  This can only be a good thing for our learners.

And as for LD issues, I know for a well-documented fact that having a 
tutor or teacher who is well meant and kind but does not "get" LD and 
language learning challenges is actually worse for the learner than 
just sitting in a class and trying to absorb something.

Just as for learners, having high expectations for teachers and tutors 
is critical to having an effective program.

As a start for ESOL and learning challengs,  programs might want to 
look at the handbook : Taking Action: A Handbook for Instructors of 
Adult ESOL Learners with Learning Dissablities"  produced and 
distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities Association (visit 
www.ldaminnesota.org to find it).  This walks teachers through the 
topic of LD and an approach to determining if other problems might be 
at the root of learning difficulties.

There is also a great handbook for tutors teaching reading to 
English-speaking adults  called The Adult Reading Toolkit ( ART)

Both of these are designed for tutors and teachers who have little 
prior knowledge on the topic--and they are extremely user-friendly and 
beautifully thought out.   --And no, I don't have any financial 
interest in them......

Hi Robin - it was South Dakota, one of those nameless flyover states!
 
And I couldn't agree with you more that teachers absolutely need to be
trained and educated in this.  My comment was only that too much
information in the very first teacher training may be wasted or even
counter-productive.  Teachers can only absorb so much in one six hour
training, and usually until they have begun to teach they don't have a
conceptual framework to help them process much information.  They are
hungry for classroom strategies and techniques - they want to know what
to DO in the multi-level classroom that they are facing the very next
week.  
 
But as for ongoing training and higher expectations for adult ed
teachers, and the entire rest of your posting, I couldn't agree with you
more.

Hello Aaron,

We are wondering about assessment over here in UK, in anticipation of the 
government adopting synthetic phonics for teaching in schools.  You mention 
http://eff.cls.utk.edu/assessment/read5.htm as a source of a standard for 
assessment.  But the mention of "selecting a reading strategy" and "using 
various strategies" (for decoding and word recognition), makes it 
inappropriate for us.  The reason why our National Literacy Strategy has 
failed is that a mixture of strategies has been recommended - in particular 
a process of "multi-cueing" where the learning reader is expected to guess a 
word from various cues or clues, including pictures, context, comparison 
with known sight words, and, lastly, the sound of the first letter. 
Synthetic phonics sweeps all that away, and lets the reader concentrate on 
the decoding process - a single strategy if you like.  Thus assessment has 
now to be geared to determining how well that process has been learnt, 
reflecting inevitably on how well that process has been taught.  I believe 
that the assessment should be applied to the learning and teaching of 
literacy, regardless of the age of the learner, where comprehension is not 
an issue, i.e. where English is the mother tongue.  (Obviously, when 
comprehension is an issue, there need to be additional tests for 
comprehension.)  Are any States adopting this kind of assessment, for 
children and/or adult learners?  Here in UK, we'd like to learn from others' 
experience.

Cheers from Chiswick,

John

Thanks for the clarification, Missy-- yes it CAN get overwhelming, but 
maybe teachers, like our learners, need a longer entry into the 
work--if it were framed as a privilege to be earned to be able to work 
with learners and not something with automatic access, the notion of 
having to be more informed and prepared might fly better......Some 
adult programs are now doing this for extended orientations--- 
requiring that learners complete some sort of orientation or 
preparation in order to get a tutor or assigned to a class.    Robin

Hi Robin - it was South Dakota, one of those nameless flyover states!

And I couldn't agree with you more that teachers absolutely need to be 
trained and educated in this.? My comment was only that too much 
information in the very first teacher training may be wasted or even 
counter-productive. ?Teachers can only absorb so much in one six hour 
training, and usually until they have begun to teach they don't have a 
conceptual framework to help them process much information. ?They are 
hungry for classroom strategies and techniques - they want to know what 
to DO in the multi-level classroom that they are facing the very next

Hi --this is in response to the person from Oregon or Washington and to



Janet Isserlis on another list, both of whose topic was teacher



professional development and the fear of overloading teachers with



information.



?



This topic is near and dear to my heart.? As I indicated in another



posting today, it is surprising to me that the field of ESL does not



seem to prepare teachers for the sort of really hard-core learning



problems that several readers and responders have mentioned.



?



In another message on one of the NIFL lists the notion of profesisonal



development qualification standards for teachers in adult education was



mentioned.



?



Frankly, what I often see is that it is too common that teachers in



adult education and adult ESOL education are woefully unqualified to do



what they do.?? Then learners suffer.?? My article in FOB indicated



that in some of those cases, teachers were simply not prepared to ask



the right questions or to consider the key issues in adult ESOL



learners' situations that significantly impact the learners' progress



in their settings.



?



Those of you who know me, know that I get pretty passionate on this



topic.? I believe, as do my business partners, Laura Weisel and Al



Toops, we are supposed to be in business for the learners, not for the



tutors and teachers in our programs.? In other words, it is not the



needs and limitations of the teachers or tutors that should drive



decisions or policies about how our programs run but rather the needs



of our learners.? I have advocated for years that there need to be



minimal qualifications for hiring teachers or tutors to teach adult



ESOL learners.? I can write an entire book-- and someday will-- of



stories like those in the article where the learner was somehow blamed



for no progress when in truth the learner's teacher had no idea how to



address the learner's real needs.



?



I agree strongly with Janet that it is essential that the nature of



learning challenges-- of all kinds, including language learning



challenges-- be constantly put out to teachers and required reading for



them.??? Though I am sure no program is going to fire its tutors



because I say so, I certainly hope you will consider a far more



stringent approach to requiring that those already in your employ



inform themselves about adult learners and adult ESOL learning,? about



the very most basic principles of language instruction,? about the



culture of their learners. etc.??? Also, program administrators have



everything to gain by requiring more training for tutors and better



experience and qualifications for teachers.? In the end, they will be



more effective and programs with have better outcomes.? The NCSALL



research project on learner persistence (2005 --at NCSCALL.net)



indicated that when tutors were better trained, not only were learners



happier and tended to persist longer, but tutors also persisted because



they did not feel so helpless in helping those with significant



learning needs.



?



Somewhere recently I saw reference to the suggestion or proposal that



adult education teachers be subject to qualification much as K-12



teachers are.? This can only be a good thing for our learners.



?



And as for LD issues, I know for a well-documented fact that having a



tutor or teacher who is well meant and kind but does not "get" LD and



language learning challenges is actually worse for the learner than



just sitting in a class and trying to absorb something.



?



Just as for learners, having high expectations for teachers and tutors



is critical to having an effective program.



?



As a start for ESOL and learning challengs,? programs might want to



look at the handbook : Taking Action: A Handbook for Instructors of



Adult ESOL Learners with Learning Dissablities"? produced and



distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities Association (visit



www.ldaminnesota.org to find it).? This walks teachers through the



topic of LD and an approach to determining if other problems might be



at the root of learning difficulties.

There is also a great handbook for tutors teaching reading to

HI all,
Some thoughts to add to Robin's:
It's true that better training for teachers and tutors will result in
more and better student outcomes. That's kind of an inarguable point.
However: that is also assuming that there is a plethora of teachers and
tutors out there, and we have the luxury of being highly selective when
it comes to choosing volunteer tutors and teachers. That's simply  not
the reality. Oftentimes the opposite is true: we have to accept those
who are willing to learn but inexperienced, and do the best we can to
inspire and train them. 
Teaching has never been a field that attracts a huge number of people.
There are realities around pay, job security, and benefits that have had
the effect of reducing the numbers of people interested in this
profession.  I consider myself lucky when I get someone in my office who
expresses an interest in teaching for me on a part-time basis, who may
have limited teaching experience, but has a sincere desire to "give
back" to their community.  
So the question really is:  Should we aspire to fewer, but better
trained teachers and tutors (which would be the reality if we became
more stringent in our selection criteria)? I know that if I were to
require additional training and certification for tutors and teachers, I
would lose a significant number of my teachers. And know that these are
GOOD teachers, but most of them work full-time during the day, or are
stay-at-home moms, and work for me in the evenings teaching part-time,
and they don't have much spare time beyond those commitments.  
I don't have the answers, but it's important to balance our idealism
with the realities of the profession when considering future directions.

I am in UK and training to be a Literacy Tutor but so far except one 
excercise everything else we are being trained in does not make any sense. 
Well, not to me because I have studied linguistics before but most of my 
colleagues are facing difficulties trying to grasp the whole training 
aspects. I believe the training should be more practical. We can write 
tonnes of assignments but that will only show our skills of writing and not 
teaching or pdegogy.

Hi Aliya,

It is very good to have a person who understands linguistics teaching 
literacy, because many teachers flounder through lack of understanding of 
the elements of language.  My particular concern is that, with the UK going 
over to synthetic phonics, teachers will not understand the basis of that 
change, and will continue in their old ways whilst trying to bolt on the 
phonics.  This will not work, and when they get poor results they will blame 
the method.  So we really need to have good guidance to teachers, with 
practical advice on how to teach in various settings and how to teach 
learners with particular problems, including vision or hearing impairment, 
attention deficit, language understanding, conceptual misunderstandings, 
memory of sounds, etc.  At the moment such guidance is lacking, and we 
intend to do something about this.  We know that there are already some good 
programmes to follow, such as Jolly Phonics, but without the teacher 
understanding the basis for synthetic phonics, and without practical advice, 
the teacher is liable to fail to implement the method properly and obtain 
the 100% success which was shown to be possible in Clackmannanshire.  So 
good guidance will be crucial in teacher training.

Best wishes,

John

Hi,
  
  As one of those who fits between the certified teacher category and the  educationally inexperienced category, I have to say that what has  helped me the most dealing with any class or student issue. (I taught  overseas at colleges for two years, did other things--an RN-- for about  20 years, taught in Prince George's County's Refugee Program in  Maryland, and earned a masters in curriuculum and instruction.)
  
  1. Clear, excellent models of skills to be learned and techniques of instruction
  
  2. A cadre of experienced and successful professionals to talk to
  
  3. Good references to learn from
  
  4. A good library of class materials on-site
  
  The LD thing is really frustrating because it is so ameboid. I've asked  my current program to buy some of the materials that have been referred  to in this listing, because, while I really enjoy the global aspects of  discussion, I have to be able to walk into class and do something that  will benefit the student. I don't have "world enough and time." 
  
  I hope that in the materials I am able to find some straightforward  frameworks I can use to organize assessment and interventions. 
  
  One question may help, how do you organize initial assessment and class  plans with specific students in mind? Can you give us a walk through?
  
  South Dakota, a land of black dirt and straight roads and distant horizons.
  
  Thanks,

  Some thoughts to add to Robin's:
  It's true that better training for teachers and tutors will result   in more and better student outcomes. That's kind of an inarguable point.   However: that is also assuming that there is a plethora of teachers and   tutors out there, and we have the luxury of being highly selective when it comes   to choosing volunteer tutors and teachers. That's simply  not the reality.   Oftentimes the opposite is true: we have to accept those who are willing to   learn but inexperienced, and do the best we can to inspire and train them.   
  Teaching has never been a field that attracts a huge number of   people. There are realities around pay, job security, and benefits that have had   the effect of reducing the numbers of people interested in this   profession.  I consider myself lucky when I get someone in my office who   expresses an interest in teaching for me on a part-time basis, who may have   limited teaching experience, but has a sincere desire to "give back" to their   community.  
  So the question really is:  Should we aspire to fewer, but   better trained teachers and tutors (which would be the reality if we became more   stringent in our selection criteria)? I know that if I were to require   additional training and certification for tutors and teachers, I would lose a   significant number of my teachers. And know that these are GOOD teachers, but   most of them work full-time during the day, or are stay-at-home moms, and work   for me in the evenings teaching part-time, and they don't have much spare time   beyond those commitments.  
  I don't have the answers, but it's important to balance our   idealism with the realities of the profession when considering future   directions.

    Hi Robin - it was South Dakota, one of those nameless   flyover states!
   
  And I couldn't agree with you more that teachers   absolutely need to be trained and educated in this.  My comment was only that too much   information in the very first teacher training may be wasted or   even counter-productive.  Teachers   can only absorb so much in one six hour training, and   usually until they have begun to teach they don't have a conceptual framework to   help them process much information.  They are hungry for classroom strategies   and techniques - they want to know what to DO in the multi-level classroom that   they are facing the very next week.    
   
  But as for ongoing training and higher expectations for   adult ed teachers, and the entire rest of your posting,   I couldn't agree with you more.

  Hi --this is in response to the person from Oregon or   Washington and to 
  Janet Isserlis on another list, both of whose topic was   teacher 
  professional development and the fear of overloading   teachers with 
  information.
   
  This topic is near and dear to my heart.  As I indicated in another   
  posting today, it is surprising to me that the field of   ESL does not 
  seem to prepare teachers for the sort of really   hard-core learning 
  problems that several readers and responders have   mentioned.
   
  In another message on one of the NIFL lists the notion   of profesisonal 
  development qualification standards for teachers in   adult education was 
  mentioned.
   
  Frankly, what I often see is that it is too common that   teachers in 
  adult education and adult ESOL education are woefully   unqualified to do 
  what they do.   Then learners suffer.   My article in FOB indicated   
  that in some of those cases, teachers were simply not   prepared to ask 
  the right questions or to consider the key issues in   adult ESOL 
  learners' situations that significantly impact the   learners' progress 
  in their settings.
   
  Those of you who know me, know that I get pretty   passionate on this 
  topic.  I   believe, as do my business partners, Laura Weisel and Al   
  Toops, we are supposed to be in business for the   learners, not for the 
  tutors and teachers in our programs.  In other words, it is not the   
  needs and limitations of the teachers or tutors that   should drive 
  decisions or policies about how our programs run but   rather the needs 
  of our learners.    I have advocated for years that there need to be   
  minimal qualifications for hiring teachers or tutors to   teach adult 
  ESOL learners.    I can write an entire book-- and someday will-- of   
  stories like those in the article where the learner was   somehow blamed 
  for no progress when in truth the learner's teacher had   no idea how to 
  address the learner's real   needs.
   
  I agree strongly with Janet that it is essential that   the nature of 
  learning challenges-- of all kinds, including language   learning 
  challenges-- be constantly put out to teachers and   required reading for 
  them.      Though I am sure no program is going to fire its tutors   
  because I say so, I certainly hope you will consider a   far more 
  stringent approach to requiring that those already in   your employ 
  inform themselves about adult learners and adult ESOL   learning,  about   
  the very most basic principles of language   instruction,  about the   
  culture of their learners. etc.    Also, program administrators   have 
  everything to gain by requiring more training for tutors   and better 
  experience and qualifications for teachers.  In the end, they will be   
  more effective and programs with have better   outcomes.  The NCSALL   
  research project on learner persistence (2005 --at   NCSCALL.net) 
  indicated that when tutors were better trained, not only   were learners 
  happier and tended to persist longer, but tutors also   persisted because 
  they did not feel so helpless in helping those with   significant 
  learning needs.
   
  Somewhere recently I saw reference to the suggestion or   proposal that 
  adult education teachers be subject to qualification   much as K-12 
  teachers are.    This can only be a good thing for our   learners.
   
  And as for LD issues, I know for a well-documented fact   that having a 
  tutor or teacher who is well meant and kind but does not   "get" LD and 
  language learning challenges is actually worse for the   learner than 
  just sitting in a class and trying to absorb   something.
   
  Just as for learners, having high expectations for   teachers and tutors 
  is critical to having an effective   program.
   
  As a start for ESOL and learning challengs,  programs might want to   
  look at the handbook : Taking Action: A Handbook for   Instructors of 
  Adult ESOL Learners with Learning Dissablities"  produced and   
  distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities   Association (visit 
  www.ldaminnesota.org to find it).  This walks teachers through the   
  topic of LD and an approach to determining if other   problems might be 
  at the root of learning   difficulties.
   
  There is also a great handbook for tutors teaching   reading to 
  English-speaking adults  called The Adult Reading Toolkit (   ART)
   
  Both of these are designed for tutors and teachers who   have little 
  prior knowledge on the topic--and they are extremely   user-friendly and 
  beautifully thought out.   --And no, I don't have any   financial 
  interest in them......

You might consider developing a "correct" nonsense word testing  system.  If 
you want to see a highly incorrect (87% misspelled nonsense  words) you might 
want to visit dibels.com and check out their level one.  I  didn't bother 
going past that after finding so many egregious errors.  I  did inform them.  I 
even showed each incorrect misspelling of a nonsense  word, why they were 
misspelled, and made suggestions for having a correctly  spelled nonsense word to 
test the child's knowledge of the phonic principle  involved.  I got a polite 
thank you and that was that.

If you would  like assistance in a project such as that, I would be glad to

Message-ID: <s3fadfab.090@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Robin and others,

One thing that struck me in the article was how health and home stress
issues affected people's learning. For example, Anna Maria had the
hearing problem and the mother with alzheimers, and Henri was
preoccupied with his prostate cancer. It seems that health issues for
the learner and the learner's family can be significant barriers to
learning.

Any more ideas for assessing and addressing these types of problems?

Thanks,

Julie

Hello all,
	I've very much enjoyed Robin's suggestions, especially about 
phonological awareness.  I'd appreciate knowing about any materials, 
particularly pictures, which concentrate on rhyming.  Googling 
"phonological awareness", I've found some, but I'd be interested in 
materials already assembled.  Assuming my pre-literate Somali, 
Sudanese, and Vietnamese elderly refugees proceed well, I'd also like 
Robin's minimal pairs list. Robin, how can I contact you off list?

Hi John

I believe that we are receiving inadequate training in Literacy Level 4 as 
well. The teacher is not explaining the terms properly. Like I said I am not 
finding that too difficult since I am already familiar with most of the 
concepts but most of the students think the course is too difficult for them 
and they cannot even apply most of what they study in the class. We are 
studying Sythetic and Analytic Phonics in Phonology but even these topics 
were not taught properly. I know at level 4 we are expected to do alot of 
learning on our own but still for my colleagues the course is not being 
delivered properly. The delivery methods are not adequate either hence 
teachers are blaming the syllabus and not the trainers. I hope they will 
provide trainers with adequate training before initiating the course. Thank 
you for your comments.
Aliya

I think it's just these kind of issues that no amount of statistical data ever covers  - especially when it comes down to NRS reporting etc, but these are very real issues faced by many of our older and younger adult students alike. These issues affect every thing from individual attendance to long term retention numbers. I have a student in my class as well whose mother has alzheimers. It takes a great deal of her emotional strength just to deal with it on a day to day basis let alone have anything left over to think and comprehend with. Add to that, the student also has a child under a year old with asthma.   A person's health, and the health of those around them, I feel, directly impacts his or her ability to learn. If you're concentrating so much on a pain or discomfort you have, there is no way you can fully concentrate on the material you're trying to learn.  If you're worried about your loved ones, you can't focus on the learning. I think looking at these barriers and trying to find ways to overcome them is a very important and real issue for all of us.

Hi Robin and others,

One thing that struck me in the article was how health and home stress
issues affected people's learning. For example, Anna Maria had the
hearing problem and the mother with alzheimers, and Henri was
preoccupied with his prostate cancer. It seems that health issues for
the learner and the learner's family can be significant barriers to

Any more ideas for assessing and addressing these types of problems?

	low	literate/non-literate learners
Message-ID: <s3fb4c2e.041@mailgate.lagcc.cuny.edu>

Hello all,
I'm not sure if my questions fall under the writing or the visual
problems categories or both, but here it is:

In my years of teaching to low-level ESOL adults, I have had many
students who I would call "weak writers" for lack of a better term,
often, these students have dropped out of school early, like 5th-8th
grades, but these are not non-literate students.  They usually require
much more time to write and copy from the board, and many students have
the problem of copying incorrectly.  We don't have any way of screening
for disabilities right now in our programs.  My assumption was that 
many students just were "out of practice", having spent many years out
of school both in their own countries and in the US, and essentially
their writing muscles are out of shape.  Is this possible or should I
always suspect LD?

In addition, I am quite surprised at the large number of students, even
the ones who write faster, who copy things incorrectly off the board. 
It's hard to know if this just comes from L1 interference.

If indeed it was possible to test students for the visual and learning
problems, how and where to refer our students?  Unfortunately we don't
have nor do we know of "Special Education" for adult ESOL learners.

Coincidentally, I have begun to find out just how many students have
visual problems and trying to find them affordable care.  Does anyone
have resources for this?  So far we don't know of any.

Thanks for an interesting...and important discussion.

Subject: writing and handwriting for low literate /non-literate
learners

This is in response to Aaron's and others' comments and questions on 
teaching writing to low or non-literate learners. 
 
Though this is an area I am not so well acquainted with, here are some

observations and thoughts: 
 
AS for phonological skills, the skill of handwriting requires roughly 
the same preparation that young children get before they are expected 
to write easily-- lots and lots of fine motor practice-- the muscles 
for holding a writing instrument must be developed and the movements 
developed from large to small. When remediating these skills in persons

with dysgraphia, it is necessary to start with large arm movements, 
creating circles and other letter-related movements on the board or on

newspaper with markers ( pens , especially most ball point pens, are 
slippery for those with hand writing challenges--plus the added tactile

input of markers is helpful in teaching the fingers to grasp 
correctly.) Fat pens or pencils would be helpful in the beginning-- or

fat markers. 
 
Much tracing experience is recommended--plus other kinds of activities

that involve fine motor with a writing tool-- mazes, connecting dots, 
coloring---all the things children do to strengthen their fingers and 
hands. 
There is an amazing choice of "adult" coloring books-- lovely designs,

pictures from different cultures, etc--usually available through 
museums- ( does anyone know the name of that company that produces 
those in great profusion?? They must be available on the web). 
 
There are a VERY few books for non-literate adult ESOL learners that 
include some basic tracing of letter forms, but to my highly 
opinionated view, they have far too little practice in them. Like all 
skills, these must be mastered-- overlearned-- for further writing to 
develop comfortably. Also bear in mind that for those with dyslexia and

dysgraphia, cursive is highly recommended over block printing. Thus it

will undoubtedly be easier for those learning to write for the first 
time to move directly to connected writing and curvy lines rather than

straight interrupted lines. A friend of mine in the DC area, Janette 
Haynes produced a wonderful handwriting book for adult ESOL learners 
coming from other alphabets-- it was called American Handwriting Slow 
and Easy and was a simplified cursive system. (Delta Publishing 
Systems, 1995) My Arabic college students found this very helpful--it 
has practice with check writing, names of states, different names for 
streets, cardinal and ordinal numbers, etc--all things ESOL learners 
need to learn anyway, instead of meaningless sentences. 
 
As for those who write already, here is where my culture alarms go off.

  Many other cultures have a very different approach to writing than we

do . For example, in the French=based system I taught in in Africa, 
students were obliged to have "perfect" handwriting at a very early 
age. They had a much different formation of letters than we do--and 
they were severely punished if their writing was not neat and beautiful

and if they misspelled ANYTHING. Thus learners coming from such 
cultures may be extremely hesitant to write in English, a) because they

do not know how to form the letters the way we do and b) because they 
fear being reprimanded for making errors. As Dave Barry would say, I am

NOT making this up. In my class of adult ESOL learners in Massachusetts

I encountered this very situation. These were mostly learners from Cape

Verde and Brazil, Haiti and different African countries. When I gave 
them some task to write and hardly anyone moved their pencil, I asked 
them whether they were afraid I would be mad if they made spelling 
mistakes or wrote badly= they ALL nodded vigorously. I had to assure 
them repeatedly I was not going to look at those things!!! 
 
And finally, looking further to actual composition--again culture is a

huge obstacle. How text is organized for writing varies enormously from

culture to culture--in some it is considered rude to make a point 
explicitly. It is up to the reader to figure it out. In other cultures

it is important to write EVERYTHING you know about a topic-- and these

do not understand why we get so exercised about their voluminous 
compositions that appear to us to ramble all over the place.  As I have

said many times in my trainings, the concept of main idea in writing 
does not exist much beyond our borders. This was confirmed by my next 
door neighbor here in Columbus, where I live now== she is Romanian, and

a doctoral student. She told me she also had a terrible time figuring 
out how to write in the highly linear way we do in America, --a thought

seconded by my Portugues doctoral advisor at Lesley. She said she had 
to teach herself how to write " just the important points" when she was

a newly arrived college student from Portugal.

Message-ID: <s3fb4ef9.068@mailgate.lagcc.cuny.edu>

I agree with all stated on this topic.  I have been saying for some time
that the support our students really need is in stress management and
development of confidence.  I believe that just coming to class, being
with and making friends, and improving English contributes very much to
that.  However, more development for teachers, and more resources need
to be devoted to these areas.  Luckily the program I work for does have
a case manager.  But that is one person for hundreds of students.  

I'm not sure what it would look like to support our students in these
ways, if related to class or in addition to class.
One thing our program likes to use is Problem-posing lessons, focusing
the students on the solutions to everyday problems.

Best,

Message-ID: <e6.7b0fd8d6.312cfdb7@aol.com>

I am struggling a little in this discussion with the practicality of some  of 
the suggestions. I teach total beginners. Most are refugees with little to no 
 experience in school.  I have always done needs based curriculum and found  
it effective.  We keep our students for a pretty short time as they need to  
get jobs.
I see the point of more work on phonemic recognition.  We certainly do  some 
but our main focus is on practical vocabulary and related issues (how to  find 
a job, see a doctor, talk to your child's teacher).  I've also had  great 
success with things like Jazz Chants.
But when I use more *rule based* curriculum, their eyes glaze over.  I  use 
Clear Speech for pronunciation but minimize the rule content.   Even books like 
Pronuncation Pairs don't work as well for them.
So the question is how to integrate these phonemic skills in such a  way that 
is effective and not a turn off?

Call your local Wal-mart and ask their VisionCenter what they have available. I recently was sent to them for coupons for kids that covers full exam, lenses and frames. They also suggested I call my local Lions Club, as they also offer child and adult vision assistance.

Julie and all-- there isn't any one way to do this-- but I generally do 
a pretty lengthy interview at some point early in the season with the 
learners.  In the description I just gave of how I get a class started, 
I would include questions about health etc in the interview.  I would 
also have had class conversations about such topics, keeping them very 
general, so students know that these things can interfere with their 
learning. The basic topic is "everyone learns differently for different 
reasons"--   I think in the FOB issue, there were some guiding 
questions about the health issues.

It is important NOT to think you are prying or being a social worker, 
as many teachers have told me when I urged them to do this.   As my 
article was intended to point out, without this information some pretty 
severe problems can go unnoticed and as a result learners will not 
profit from instruction/learning efforts as they should.    At the same 
time it is important to be sensitive to the culture(s) of your learners 
and what the norms are for discussing problems or for persons with 
challenges.  If they think they will be punished for having a problem ( 
something even my most aware college ESL students feared greatly ) they 
are unlikely to self identify or confess to having  a problem. That is 
where the one-on-one times with members of a class are very helpful.  
You establish a warm, personal relationship so they will feel more 
comfortable about talking about these things.  --though in the cases I 
cite in my article, except for one, I did not know these students well 
and they still spilled all to me in a private conversation.    Robin

Hi Robin and others,

One thing that struck me in the article was how health and home stress
issues affected people's learning. For example, Anna Maria had the
hearing problem and the mother with alzheimers, and Henri was
preoccupied with his prostate cancer. It seems that health issues for
the learner and the learner's family can be significant barriers to
learning.

Any more ideas for assessing and addressing these types of problems?

Yes, that is one of the challenges of working with adults with such 
stressful lives-- but while these issues are difficult, I believe it is 
important that we continue to have expectations that learners WILL 
accomplish something and not just use the class for group therapy.    
It may just be a page or an activity or participating in a 
conversation, but the expectation is that they will do something.

and I want to note that in my messages I stress persistence as opposed 
to retention-- retention smacks of us hanging on to them, while 
persistence, the term used by NCSALL, indicates that the learner has 
chosen to persist.   Rlobin

I think it's just these kind of issues that no amount of statistical 
data ever
covers  - especially when it comes down to NRS reporting etc, but these 
are very
real issues faced by many of our older and younger adult students 
alike. These
issues affect every thing from individual attendance to long term 
retention
numbers. I have a student in my class as well whose mother has 
alzheimers. It
takes a great deal of her emotional strength just to deal with it on a 
day to
day basis let alone have anything left over to think and comprehend 
with. Add to
that, the student also has a child under a year old with asthma.   A 
person's
health, and the health of those around them, I feel, directly impacts 
his or her
ability to learn. If you're concentrating so much on a pain or 
discomfort you
have, there is no way you can fully concentrate on the material you're 
trying to
learn.  If you're worried about your loved ones, you can't focus on the
learning. I think looking at these barriers and
  trying to find ways to overcome them is a very important and real 
issue for all
of us.

Hi Robin and others,

One thing that struck me in the article was how health and home stress
issues affected people's learning. For example, Anna Maria had the
hearing problem and the mother with alzheimers, and Henri was
preoccupied with his prostate cancer. It seems that health issues for
the learner and the learner's family can be significant barriers to
learning.

Any more ideas for assessing and addressing these types of problems?

Thanks,

Julie

Mary Jane-- now THAT is a good, practical question!   Here is what I 
generally do with a group of adult ESL learners.  Make of this what you 
will:   First I prepare folders for each student with a few generic 
activities at different levels-- a reading/questions sort of activity, 
vocabulary matching, some phonics=related activity, some easy grammar, 
maybe a handwriting activity that includes spelling ( like the ones in 
the handwriting book I mentioned a few days ago).  Then I get a few 
things ready from whatever books are around and design them for what is 
known as differentiated teaching--one topic and one starter reading and 
then activities at a wide range of levels.   When the students first 
come, we do a rather long session on getting to know each other, and 
then I have them do one of the activities I have ready for everyone and 
I observe like crazy-- who has trouble with what, who is whizzing 
through the materials.   Then we go back to a group-based  
activity--usually a brief reading at "mid" level--whatever that is for 
the class-- and then back to individual work on that --the activities I 
have already prepared at different levels.  I go around to each student 
and work with them and observe like crazy.

The next class, as students arrive I will start them on the folders-- 
which I may already have adjusted in response to what I observed-- more 
advanced stuff for some, easier stuff for others.   Again, I observe 
and coach and take notes, both mentally and otherwise.   Then , when 
everyone is present and has had a minimum of 15 minutes in folders, we 
do group conversation, or vocabulary or a simple grammar lesson.  Then 
back and forth to individual and group work, oral and reading, etc.   
Next time I will use the folder time to begin to take students  to a 
private place for a few minutes of interview to get a better idea of 
oral skills and to ask what they especially want to work on.   I can 
usually see about 5-8 students an evening doing that-- I may put some 
of the class in small groups to work on some activity or other, 
depending on their skills.  If it is a very low-skill class, I make 
sure to have activites such as matching pictures to 
words--vocabulary/picture concentration, for example--, sentences on 
cards to put in order with a partner, puzzles ( I collect puzzles of 
states, or other sort of "educational" puzzles), handwriting 
activities, copying sentences etc.  ( Someone once asked me in 
disbelief if I evaluated EVERY one of my students this way---of course 
I do!!  How esle will I know what each needs???)

I never do formal assessment of my class simply because I LOATHE formal 
assessments--I always find that they are unfair to someone and give me 
a false idea of some students.

I was trained in the Peace Corps school of language teaching-- highly 
interactive, lots of focus on praise and reward,  focus on mastery, 
keeping the class as interesting and motivating to use English as 
possible.  I combine that with some excellent special ed training that 
taught me how to do individualized work.   The folders keep evolving to 
be highly individual and fitted to each particular learner.  I find 
that they are useful for several things, but especially for 1) having 
something useful for learners to do if they arrive early 2) giving them 
time off from listening --which is exhausting if you are a language 
learner-- 3) giving me time to work with individual students while 
others work on their own or in pairs or triplets.  4) letting me know 
just what each student's strengths and challenges are.     I give LOTS 
of feedback  on work in folders and reward perfect papers with great 
big holographic stars from Staples-- I work with all learners to make 
sure everyone has perfect papers often.   (and papers are suited to 
learners' levels s othey can get rewards readily).  I put a lot of 
emphasis, as you can imagine, on phonological skills and phonics-- with 
a very wide range of activities for that. I always do minimal pairs for 
every class I teach and lots of work on rhyme and other patterns.

Even in Adult Ed/ESL I always gave a lot of homework-- chosen with and 
by the student where possible.  Of course not everyone did the 
homework, but I made it pretty clear in many conversations about 
homework that without doing SOMETHING outside of class, they will not 
progress much at all--and that was OK as long as they understood that.  
  The vast  majority of them did some most of the time-- . I made sure 
to have a wide range of things for them to choose from.

While I was teaching at a university ESL program, I did not like to 
give grades. To me, attending and working hard , and doing homework was 
automatically a good grade-- since I was in a university setting I had 
to give grades ultimately, but provided portfolio-like activities for 
students to continue to revise to get better and better grades.   I 
NEVER graded things in adult education-- except to mark a perfect paper 
perfect.

Currently, with the program I train people to use, learners are 
screened for a variety of learning barriers that I have frequently 
mentioned--then they get reports that detail strategies they can use to 
accommodate their learning needs.  These strategies are combined with 
the learner's very tightly framed learning goals to assure they have 
full control over time decisions and material and goals--but with full 
information about what they need to do to reach those goals. Each 
learner learns to create his or her own plan with a lot of guidance. It 
is not so different from how I ran, and would continue to run, an ESL 
class-- I love working with adults because we are equals and we share 
humor and life problems and family worries and successes as adults.   
My classes are more like seminars in that respect--people moving around 
and helping each other and asking me for help with questions etc.

As the year goes by, I work at responding to what each learner has done 
and wants to do-- some make special requests--and usually will land on 
a theme that will take us many weeks to do.  I also take care to 
rework, review, reteach, restructure because adult language learners 
and those with challenges need many passes.    do not assume anyone has 
learned anything until I have multiple evidences of that ( my special 
ed training.....).    I like to have "learning stations"--activities 
learners can do on their own--around the classroom--they can go to 
those instead of or after their folder work.

I hope that gives you some ideas to go on-- it may seem unstructured, 
but in fact is highly structured.  I generally have a rough schedule-- 
30 minutes on this, an hour on that, etc-- gthe same for every evening 
so students know what to expect, and I always know where we are going 
and so do the students-- but I also always respond to teachable 
moments-- someone attended a funeral or wedding, current events, 
something happened in someone's country, etc.

Hi,

As one of those who fits between the certified teacher category and the 
educationally inexperienced category, I have to say that what has 
helped me the most dealing with any class or student issue. (I taught 
overseas at colleges for two years, did other things--an RN-- for about 
20 years, taught in Prince George's County's Refugee Program in 
Maryland, and earned a masters in curriuculum and instruction.)

1. Clear, excellent models of skills to be learned and techniques of 
instruction

2. A cadre of experienced and successful professionals to talk to

3. Good references to learn from

4. A good library of class materials on-site

The LD thing is really frustrating because it is so ameboid. I've asked 
my current program to buy some of the materials that have been referred 
to in this listing, because, while I really enjoy the global aspects of 
discussion, I have to be able to walk into class and do something that 
will benefit the student. I don't have "world enough and time."

I hope that in the materials I am able to find some straightforward 
frameworks I can use to organize assessment and interventions.

One question may help, how do you organize initial assessment and class 
plans with specific students in mind? Can you give us a walk through?

South Dakota, a land of black dirt and straight roads and distant 
horizons.

Thanks,

Some thoughts to add to Robin's:
It's true that better training for teachers and tutors will result in 
more and better student outcomes. That's kind of an inarguable point. 
However: that is also assuming that there is a plethora of teachers and 
tutors out there, and we have the luxury of being highly selective when 
it comes to choosing volunteer tutors and teachers. That's simply? not 
the reality. Oftentimes the opposite is true: we have to accept those 
who are willing to learn but inexperienced, and do the best we can to 
inspire and train them.
Teaching has never been a field that attracts a huge number of people. 
There are realities around pay, job security, and benefits that have 
had the effect of reducing the numbers of people interested in this 
profession.? I consider myself lucky when I get someone in my office 
who expresses an interest in teaching for me on a part-time basis, who 
may have limited teaching experience, but has a sincere desire to "give 
back" to their community.?
So the question really is:? Should we aspire to fewer, but better 
trained teachers and tutors (which would be the reality if we became 
more stringent in our selection criteria)? I know that if I were to 
require additional training and certification for tutors and teachers, 
I would lose a significant number of my teachers. And know that these 
are GOOD teachers, but most of them work full-time during the day, or 
are stay-at-home moms, and work for me in the evenings teaching 
part-time, and they don't have much spare time beyond those 
commitments.?
I don't have the answers, but it's important to balance our idealism 
with the realities of the profession when considering future directions.

Hi Robin - it was South Dakota, one of those nameless flyover states!
?
And I couldn't agree with you more that teachers absolutely need to be 
trained and educated in this.? My comment was only that too much 
information in the very first teacher training may be wasted or even 
counter-productive. ?Teachers can only absorb so much in one six hour 
training, and usually until they have begun to teach they don't have a 
conceptual framework to help them process much information. ?They are 
hungry for classroom strategies and techniques - they want to know what 
to DO in the multi-level classroom that they are facing the very next 
week.?
?
But as for ongoing training and higher expectations for adult ed 
teachers, and the entire rest of your posting, I couldn't agree with 
you more. ?

Hi --this is in response to the person from Oregon or Washington and to
Janet Isserlis on another list, both of whose topic was teacher
professional development and the fear of overloading teachers with
information.
?
This topic is near and dear to my heart.? As I indicated in another
posting today, it is surprising to me that the field of ESL does not
seem to prepare teachers for the sort of really hard-core learning
problems that several readers and responders have mentioned.
?
In another message on one of the NIFL lists the notion of profesisonal
development qualification standards for teachers in adult education was
mentioned.
?
Frankly, what I often see is that it is too common that teachers in
adult education and adult ESOL education are woefully unqualified to do
what they do.?? Then learners suffer.?? My article in FOB indicated
that in some of those cases, teachers were simply not prepared to ask
the right questions or to consider the key issues in adult ESOL
learners' situations that significantly impact the learners' progress
in their settings.
?
Those of you who know me, know that I get pretty passionate on this
topic.? I believe, as do my business partners, Laura Weisel and Al
Toops, we are supposed to be in business for the learners, not for the
tutors and teachers in our programs.? In other words, it is not the
needs and limitations of the teachers or tutors that should drive
decisions or policies about how our programs run but rather the needs
of our learners.? I have advocated for years that there need to be
minimal qualifications for hiring teachers or tutors to teach adult
ESOL learners.? I can write an entire book-- and someday will-- of
stories like those in the article where the learner was somehow blamed
for no progress when in truth the learner's teacher had no idea how to
address the learner's real needs.
?
I agree strongly with Janet that it is essential that the nature of
learning challenges-- of all kinds, including language learning
challenges-- be constantly put out to teachers and required reading for
them.??? Though I am sure no program is going to fire its tutors
because I say so, I certainly hope you will consider a far more
stringent approach to requiring that those already in your employ
inform themselves about adult learners and adult ESOL learning,? about
the very most basic principles of language instruction,? about the
culture of their learners. etc.??? Also, program administrators have
everything to gain by requiring more training for tutors and better
experience and qualifications for teachers.? In the end, they will be
more effective and programs with have better outcomes.? The NCSALL
research project on learner persistence (2005 --at NCSCALL.net)
indicated that when tutors were better trained, not only were learners
happier and tended to persist longer, but tutors also persisted because
they did not feel so helpless in helping those with significant
learning needs.
?
Somewhere recently I saw reference to the suggestion or proposal that
adult education teachers be subject to qualification much as K-12
teachers are.? This can only be a good thing for our learners.
?
And as for LD issues, I know for a well-documented fact that having a
tutor or teacher who is well meant and kind but does not "get" LD and
language learning challenges is actually worse for the learner than
just sitting in a class and trying to absorb something.
?
Just as for learners, having high expectations for teachers and tutors
is critical to having an effective program.
?
As a start for ESOL and learning challengs,? programs might want to
look at the handbook : Taking Action: A Handbook for Instructors of
Adult ESOL Learners with Learning Dissablities"? produced and
distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities Association (visit
www.ldaminnesota.org to find it).? This walks teachers through the
topic of LD and an approach to determining if other problems might be
at the root of learning difficulties.
?
There is also a great handbook for tutors teaching reading to
English-speaking adults? called The Adult Reading Toolkit ( ART)
?
Both of these are designed for tutors and teachers who have little
prior knowledge on the topic--and they are extremely user-friendly and
beautifully thought out.?? --And no, I don't have any financial
interest in them......

Mary-- there is very little that addresses these pre-literacy level 
skills thorougly enough to rely on them alone.  It will require much 
expansion on your part to provide enough variety in working on the low 
level skills to assure mastery.   I like a book called English Sounds 
and Spelling by McClelland, Hale and Beaudikofer, which is no longer in 
print, but available, I am told, on the internet-- it is a very 
straightforward English (ESL) phonics books, but it has many great line 
drawings of words ESL learners need to know that can be cut up and used 
for many kinds of practice.  The actual phonics lessons are good, but 
presume a certain level of other-language literacy, as most ESL phonics 
books do.    Robin

particularly pictures, which concentrate on rhyming.  Googling
"phonological awareness", I've found some, but I'd be interested in

Carolyn-- these kind of problems are actually rather prevalent in adult 
learners who struggle to learn-- copying from any place.   In the 
product I train with, we screen this skill with an adaptation of an old 
standard in special ed-- a program called the Beery Test of Visual 
Motor Integration  (VMI)  --it involves copying geometric figures and 
is remarkably diagnostic for the kinds of problems you cite. You can 
probably get a version of it by googling.   There was a wonderful adult 
screening tool called the Hull SCreening that was available in MA 
--this has a version of the VMI, too. But it is hard to get hold of.

  But also, the visual linked stress syndrome I have described will 
contbribute heavily to copying problems.  It is hard, after all, to 
copy things that are moving around or blurry.    A self test and forms 
for ordering colored overlays can be found at irlen.com -- a beware-- 
when you open that site, it starts with an example of what many people 
see!!!

Binocularity issues will also impact copying-- so be sure your students 
have had a good vision screening that includes a screening for 
binocularity. Though more are including it, many optometrists will not 
check this unless asked--and will need to be told why you are asking.   
   ( and note this is optometrists who do this, not ophthamologists, who 
operate on eyes, or opticians, who prepare lenses. )   Robin

Subject: Re: [FocusOnBasics] Fwd: writing and handwriting for low 
literate/non-literate learners

Hello all,
I'm not sure if my questions fall under the writing or the visual
problems categories or both, but here it is:

In my years of teaching to low-level ESOL adults, I have had many
students who I would call "weak writers" for lack of a better term,
often, these students have dropped out of school early, like 5th-8th
grades, but these are not non-literate students.  They usually require
much more time to write and copy from the board, and many students have
the problem of copying incorrectly.  We don't have any way of screening
for disabilities right now in our programs.  My assumption was that
many students just were "out of practice", having spent many years out
of school both in their own countries and in the US, and essentially
their writing muscles are out of shape.  Is this possible or should I
always suspect LD?

In addition, I am quite surprised at the large number of students, even
the ones who write faster, who copy things incorrectly off the board.
It's hard to know if this just comes from L1 interference.

If indeed it was possible to test students for the visual and learning
problems, how and where to refer our students?  Unfortunately we don't
have nor do we know of "Special Education" for adult ESOL learners.

Coincidentally, I have begun to find out just how many students have
visual problems and trying to find them affordable care.  Does anyone
have resources for this?  So far we don't know of any.

Thanks for an interesting...and important discussion.

Subject: writing and handwriting for low literate /non-literate
learners

This is in response to Aaron's and others' comments and questions on
teaching writing to low or non-literate learners.

Though this is an area I am not so well acquainted with, here are some

observations and thoughts:

AS for phonological skills, the skill of handwriting requires roughly
the same preparation that young children get before they are expected
to write easily-- lots and lots of fine motor practice-- the muscles
for holding a writing instrument must be developed and the movements
developed from large to small. When remediating these skills in persons

with dysgraphia, it is necessary to start with large arm movements,
creating circles and other letter-related movements on the board or on

newspaper with markers ( pens , especially most ball point pens, are
slippery for those with hand writing challenges--plus the added tactile

input of markers is helpful in teaching the fingers to grasp
correctly.) Fat pens or pencils would be helpful in the beginning-- or

fat markers.

Much tracing experience is recommended--plus other kinds of activities

that involve fine motor with a writing tool-- mazes, connecting dots,
coloring---all the things children do to strengthen their fingers and
hands.
There is an amazing choice of "adult" coloring books-- lovely designs,

pictures from different cultures, etc--usually available through
museums- ( does anyone know the name of that company that produces
those in great profusion?? They must be available on the web).

There are a VERY few books for non-literate adult ESOL learners that
include some basic tracing of letter forms, but to my highly
opinionated view, they have far too little practice in them. Like all
skills, these must be mastered-- overlearned-- for further writing to
develop comfortably. Also bear in mind that for those with dyslexia and

dysgraphia, cursive is highly recommended over block printing. Thus it

will undoubtedly be easier for those learning to write for the first
time to move directly to connected writing and curvy lines rather than

straight interrupted lines. A friend of mine in the DC area, Janette
Haynes produced a wonderful handwriting book for adult ESOL learners
coming from other alphabets-- it was called American Handwriting Slow
and Easy and was a simplified cursive system. (Delta Publishing
Systems, 1995) My Arabic college students found this very helpful--it
has practice with check writing, names of states, different names for
streets, cardinal and ordinal numbers, etc--all things ESOL learners
need to learn anyway, instead of meaningless sentences.

As for those who write already, here is where my culture alarms go off.

  Many other cultures have a very different approach to writing than we

do . For example, in the French=based system I taught in in Africa,
students were obliged to have "perfect" handwriting at a very early
age. They had a much different formation of letters than we do--and
they were severely punished if their writing was not neat and beautiful

and if they misspelled ANYTHING. Thus learners coming from such
cultures may be extremely hesitant to write in English, a) because they

do not know how to form the letters the way we do and b) because they
fear being reprimanded for making errors. As Dave Barry would say, I am

NOT making this up. In my class of adult ESOL learners in Massachusetts

I encountered this very situation. These were mostly learners from Cape

Verde and Brazil, Haiti and different African countries. When I gave
them some task to write and hardly anyone moved their pencil, I asked
them whether they were afraid I would be mad if they made spelling
mistakes or wrote badly= they ALL nodded vigorously. I had to assure
them repeatedly I was not going to look at those things!!!

And finally, looking further to actual composition--again culture is a

huge obstacle. How text is organized for writing varies enormously from

culture to culture--in some it is considered rude to make a point
explicitly. It is up to the reader to figure it out. In other cultures

it is important to write EVERYTHING you know about a topic-- and these

do not understand why we get so exercised about their voluminous
compositions that appear to us to ramble all over the place.  As I have

said many times in my trainings, the concept of main idea in writing
does not exist much beyond our borders. This was confirmed by my next
door neighbor here in Columbus, where I live now== she is Romanian, and

a doctoral student. She told me she also had a terrible time figuring
out how to write in the highly linear way we do in America, --a thought

seconded by my Portugues doctoral advisor at Lesley. She said she had
to teach herself how to write " just the important points" when she was

a newly arrived college student from Portugal.

Sometimes we get an adjunct teacher who has a background in ESOL and I 
always appreciate what they bring to the classroom because they don't 
make assumptions about what students may understand or not understand. 
For instance, one teacher who taught a current events class was always 
so good to talk about what a political "party" was, or the terms left 
wing and right wing. Even the simplest everyday expression can go right 
over the heads of many in the class. As far as the value of what one 
does goes, I remind myself of the story about the starfish on the beach.

Yes, that is right that Cleer Speech is too hard and Pron. Pairs is 
beyond them-- which is why it is important to begin with PRELITERACY 
skills--no rules-- just sounds.    If these students cannot hear 
discrete words in sentences and do not hear sound patterns, their 
vocabulary acquisition will stop quickly--that is the whole skill 
supported by the phonological memory I described last week.   It is NOT 
phonemic awareness, let me say that again.  Phonemes are individual 
sounds in words. Phonological skills for preliteracy is awareness of 
larger chunks of sounds---words, syllables and the sounds that add to 
meaning--stress and intonation.   - I am so glad you mentioned Carolyn 
Graham's Jazz Chant s--the very beginning levels of those should be 
great as they put a lot of emphasis on individual words in sentences 
and on the rhythm of language.   But if the learners cannot hear where 
words begin and end then the vocabulary building will not progress.   
Minimal pairs like all else i recommend, can be done without reference 
to text or rules.

Remember again that the phonological skills I am referring to are the 
"eyes closed, lights out  work of language"---what you can know about 
language from just listening to it.    NO RULES  for the preliterate!  
The things I was referring to about the sound of past tense etc. can 
all be taught orally without reference to rules but rather by modeling. 
  I would recommend not using any books at all, as these learners get 
little from them.  It is all, pardon the expression, GREEK to 
them...... Robin

Subject: [FocusOnBasics] More questions

I am struggling a little in this discussion with the practicality of 
some of the suggestions. I teach total beginners. Most are refugees 
with little to no experience in school.? I have always done needs based 
curriculum and found it effective.? We keep our students for a pretty 
short time as they need to get jobs.
I see the point of more work on phonemic recognition.? We certainly do 
some but our main focus is on practical vocabulary and related issues 
(how to find a job, see a doctor, talk to your child's teacher).? I've 
also had great success with things like Jazz Chants.
But when I use more *rule based* curriculum, their eyes glaze over.? I 
use Clear Speech for pronunciation but minimize the rule content.? Even 
books like Pronuncation Pairs don't work as well for them.
So the question is?how to integrate these phonemic skills in such a way 
that is effective and not a turn off?

Hello all,
I'm not sure if my questions  fall under the writing or the visual
problems categories or both, but here it  is:

In my years of teaching to low-level ESOL adults, I have had  many
students who I would call "weak writers" for lack of a better  term,
often, these students have dropped out of school early, like  5th-8th
grades, but these are not non-literate students.  They usually  require
much more time to write and copy from the board, and many students  have
the problem of copying incorrectly.  We don't have any way of  screening
for disabilities right now in our programs.  My assumption was  that 
many students just were "out of practice", having spent many years  out
of school both in their own countries and in the US, and  essentially
their writing muscles are out of shape.  Is this possible or  should I
always suspect LD?
 
Don McCabe's answer:  Your assumption is probably  right.  There always is 
the problem of a slight loss of automaticity  in making the connection between 
the mind and the muscles from lack of  activity.  I know my automatic 
handwriting has suffered a decline because  99% of all my writing is done on the 
computer.

To all,
Health and family issues may interfere with teaching as much as with learning. While it is important to be aware of what may impede a learner's learning, we would not tell them what might be interfering with our teaching.  As adults with complicated lives, teachers and learners come to the classroom to learn and teach each other in an environment which excludes very temporarily our outside lives.   
With the exception of adult learners that are required to attend as part of a  school-to-work program (for example), the ESOL learners I have had the pleasure to teach have attended because they think the learning in the classroom is more important than sleep, free time, learning on their own, etc... It  would be a disservice to them as well as misleading to have them think we can do something for them beyond the classroom.  I think it is important for learners to know the limits of their teacher's abilities and what the classroom is and what it is not. 
Stated more simpy:  learners will not come if they don't think it is making a  difference.  Likewise, they know when something is interfering with their learning therefore attend only when they know it is beneficial to them.  However, we must teach regardless we can or we can't. 
Training and ongoing  professional development should not only make pre-service and in-service teachers aware of what might affect a learner's learning but a teacher's teaching and train them to understand the limits of the classroom arena.  Teachers'  persistence and retention are on a par with learners' persistence and retention.

Thanks to Tom Woods for the encouraging response.  I've heard excellent
things about your program in Vermont,Tom. And yes, I suppose if I'm going to
continue to function successfully in this setting, I need to keep reminding
myself about the realities of the student population and to lower my
expectations. I appreciate your input.

Iris,
You are not alone.I too am a corrections educator. You described a 
similar situation to what I see in my job in VT, a simply huge variety 
of abilities and levels. Your situation sounds a bit more complicated 
than mine because the vast majority of my students are able to speak 
English.

I think that the hardest cases for me are when traumatic brain injuries 
co-mingle with chronic drug and alcohol abuse. It is so unpredictable 
what kinds of learning problems these individuals may experience.

It sounds like you are extremely frustrated with your work with the 
offenders. If you are given freedom to develop the education program 
where you work, you might look at it as a wonderful opportunity to 
create a system that works for your guys where nothing has ever worked 
before.

Ten things I've learned as I helped build our high school, the Community 
High School of Vermont, are:
1. You can't help everybody.
2. Everyone comes to you at his own level and works at his own pace.
3. Some problems of individuals are bigger than education.
4. It is best to have no expectations for your students, not low 
expectations. No expectations.
5. Appreciate whatever gains might be made, no matter what they may  be.
6. Every student is good at something.
7. Students have to direct the course of their education. Teachers 
assist them.
8. Don't try doing it the other way around or you will fail miserably 
and drive all your students away.
9. You may not know when you will gain a new student or lose an old 
student so your classes have to be self-standing, not dependent on a 
sequence of classes the student may have missed.
10. These things motivate learners. and a motivated learner cannot be 
stopped. He will learn more than you ever thought possible, learning and 
emotional disabilities become irrelevant.

Best wishes,
Tom Woods

Hi All,

Thank you all so much for your input during this past week's discussion
of struggling ESOL learners. And HUGE thanks to Robin for sharing her
experience and knowledge with us all. I especially appreciated the
specific, practical advice she was able to give that stemmed from years
of study and research, and the geniune sense of caring for the learners
that so clearly guides her attitude and methods of teaching. 

We can all still continue this discussion, but we gratefully say goodbye
to Robin with thanks for answering our questions and concerns so fully.
I will go through the postings and compile all the specific links, book
titles, workbooks, etc. that were recommended as resources and have them
for you next week.

Thanks again,

Robin,

Thanks for all the great info you've shared with us over the last week.  You've answered a great range of questions and even shared some great sources with us.  I know you're also involved with PowerPath, a wonderful LD screening tool.  I've been using it in the last several weeks and my students have been very receptive!  I was worried that approaching the question of asking them about their learning difficulties might be awkward, but I'm finding that they are eager to share and even more eager to get some help as well as thrilled to get the accommodations that PowerPath gives.  Many of my students have shown (through the testing) that they are indeed scotopically sensitive and benefit from a colored filter.  I'm grateful for all the knowledge you've passed on this week.   Again, Thanks

Lest there be any misunderstanding about the implications of my message 
and article, I am not advocating teachers' necessarily doing anything 
about their students' "exterior" problems, but rather being aware of 
those that impact learning in the classroom.  In some cases, it might 
be important to make the learner aware of support services he or she 
could access.  In questions of vision, however, I tend to be the one 
giving referrals to a doctor I trust or to a place ( such as the Lions 
Club) that can help with this.  In the adult ESOL program I worked in 
in MA there was a counselor present most of the time--he would connect 
learners with community resources as needed.

Acknowledgement of the problem can go far in helping learners keep on 
trying--as it did for Henri--who attended though it WAS NOT beneficial 
for him in terms of learning English--  while finding out about the 
hearing loss meant a far more appropriate learning setting and 
counseling about employment discrimination rights for Anna.

To all,
Health and family issues may interfere with?teaching as much as with 
learning. While it is important to be aware of what may impede a 
learner's learning, we would not tell them what might be interfering 
with our teaching.? As adults with complicated lives, teachers and 
learners come to the classroom to learn and teach each other in an 
environment which excludes very temporarily our outside lives.??
With the exception of adult learners that are required to attend as 
part of a? school-to-work program (for example), the ESOL learners I 
have had the pleasure to teach have attended because they think the 
learning in the classroom is more important than sleep, free time, 
learning on their own, etc... It? would be a disservice to them as well 
as misleading to have them think we can do something for them beyond 
the classroom.? I think it is important for learners to know the limits 
of their teacher's abilities and what the classroom is and what it is 
not.
Stated more simpy: ?learners will not come if they don't think it is 
making a? difference.??Likewise, they know when something is 
interfering with their learning therefore attend only?when they know it 
is beneficial to them.? However, we must teach regardless we can or we 
can't.
Training and ongoing? professional development should not only make 
pre-service and in-service teachers aware of what might affect a 
learner's learning but a teacher's teaching and train them to 
understand the limits of the classroom arena.? Teachers' ?persistence 
and retention are on a par with learners' persistence and retention.?
?
Best,

Without addressing specifics of Sandy's message, let me restate my 
position that a) underprepared teachers and tutors can often do more 
harm than good (nearly all of the cases in my article came about 
because of teachers who had little experience or were not trained in 
ESOL issues at all)-- and b) that I believe the needs of our learners 
should drive the decisions and policies of the programs.   This means 
that we serve our learners best by requiring that tutors and teachers 
working with them have the information and training needed to do a 
reasonably good job--and must be willing to continue to learn on the 
job.  I have way too often --WAY too often--seen people taking the 
evening teaching job just because it was extra income. There was little 
interest in whether they were being effective for adult learners or 
adult ESOL learners.  Another issue is the belief that just because one 
has either lived in another country or speaks another language that 
that qualifies one to teach ESOL.


I think I cited a lot earlier my Columbian doctor students in Boston 
who spent an awful lot of money and an awful lot of time in a private 
ESL school with a teacher who was really an engineer.  He had no idea 
how to explain the complexities of English to these hard working 
learners--and they were frustrated literally to tears at having made no 
progress in English--literally no progress--in over 6 months.  And I 
did not cite other cases such as Jeanne, the Haitian lady whom I was 
told was "unteachable" and that her teachers had "tried everything" and 
she could not learn.   I do not accept these reasons.   What was clear 
was that Jeanne's teacher had never encountered a completely 
non-literate person and had no idea how to teach her.   Is it really 
Jeanne's fault that she was not learning???  That is the message that 
is almost always conveyed.

I think it is only respectful to those learners whom Dominique 
Brillanceau cites as wanting to come to school for any reason that we 
serve them the very best we can---that may mean not giviing them an 
underqualified teacher. I hope that programs are not in business to 
give tutors some place to volunteer rather than to give learners the 
best education possible.    Better teachers will mean better results 
for programs as more learners actually progress and complete goals.  
Perhaps creative directors can figure out how make pay that would cover 
several untrained teachers or tutors to pay more for a highly qualfied 
one.

ProLiteracy, among other organizations, has gone far towards creating 
training programs for new tutors because literacy providers know that 
if tutors are untrained, learners cannot progress and will not persist. 
   Why can't this be the case in ESOL??

HI all,
Some thoughts to add to Robin's:
It's true that better training for teachers and tutors will result in 
more and better student outcomes. That's kind of an inarguable point. 
However: that is also assuming that there is a plethora of teachers and 
tutors out there, and we have the luxury of being highly selective when 
it comes to choosing volunteer tutors and teachers. That's simply? not 
the reality. Oftentimes the opposite is true: we have to accept those 
who are willing to learn but inexperienced, and do the best we can to 
inspire and train them.
Teaching has never been a field that attracts a huge number of people. 
There are realities around pay, job security, and benefits that have 
had the effect of reducing the numbers of people interested in this 
profession.? I consider myself lucky when I get someone in my office 
who expresses an interest in teaching for me on a part-time basis, who 
may have limited teaching experience, but has a sincere desire to "give 
back" to their community.?
So the question really is:? Should we aspire to fewer, but better 
trained teachers and tutors (which would be the reality if we became 
more stringent in our selection criteria)? I know that if I were to 
require additional training and certification for tutors and teachers, 
I would lose a significant number of my teachers. And know that these 
are GOOD teachers, but most of them work full-time during the day, or 
are stay-at-home moms, and work for me in the evenings teaching 
part-time, and they don't have much spare time beyond those 
commitments.?
I don't have the answers, but it's important to balance our idealism 
with the realities of the profession when considering future directions.

Hi Robin - it was South Dakota, one of those nameless flyover states!



?



And I couldn't agree with you more that teachers absolutely need to be 
trained and educated in this.? My comment was only that too much 
information in the very first teacher training may be wasted or even 
counter-productive. ?Teachers can only absorb so much in one six hour 
training, and usually until they have begun to teach they don't have a 
conceptual framework to help them process much information. ?They are 
hungry for classroom strategies and techniques - they want to know what 
to DO in the multi-level classroom that they are facing the very next 
week.?



?



But as for ongoing training and higher expectations for adult ed 
teachers, and the entire rest of your posting, I couldn't agree with 
you more. ?

Hi --this is in response to the person from Oregon or Washington and to



Janet Isserlis on another list, both of whose topic was teacher



professional development and the fear of overloading teachers with



information.



?



This topic is near and dear to my heart.? As I indicated in another



posting today, it is surprising to me that the field of ESL does not



seem to prepare teachers for the sort of really hard-core learning



problems that several readers and responders have mentioned.



?



In another message on one of the NIFL lists the notion of profesisonal



development qualification standards for teachers in adult education was



mentioned.



?



Frankly, what I often see is that it is too common that teachers in



adult education and adult ESOL education are woefully unqualified to do



what they do.?? Then learners suffer.?? My article in FOB indicated



that in some of those cases, teachers were simply not prepared to ask



the right questions or to consider the key issues in adult ESOL



learners' situations that significantly impact the learners' progress



in their settings.



?



Those of you who know me, know that I get pretty passionate on this



topic.? I believe, as do my business partners, Laura Weisel and Al



Toops, we are supposed to be in business for the learners, not for the



tutors and teachers in our programs.? In other words, it is not the



needs and limitations of the teachers or tutors that should drive



decisions or policies about how our programs run but rather the needs



of our learners.? I have advocated for years that there need to be



minimal qualifications for hiring teachers or tutors to teach adult



ESOL learners.? I can write an entire book-- and someday will-- of



stories like those in the article where the learner was somehow blamed



for no progress when in truth the learner's teacher had no idea how to



address the learner's real needs.



?



I agree strongly with Janet that it is essential that the nature of



learning challenges-- of all kinds, including language learning



challenges-- be constantly put out to teachers and required reading for



them.??? Though I am sure no program is going to fire its tutors



because I say so, I certainly hope you will consider a far more



stringent approach to requiring that those already in your employ



inform themselves about adult learners and adult ESOL learning,? about



the very most basic principles of language instruction,? about the



culture of their learners. etc.??? Also, program administrators have



everything to gain by requiring more training for tutors and better



experience and qualifications for teachers.? In the end, they will be



more effective and programs with have better outcomes.? The NCSALL



research project on learner persistence (2005 --at NCSCALL.net)



indicated that when tutors were better trained, not only were learners



happier and tended to persist longer, but tutors also persisted because



they did not feel so helpless in helping those with significant



learning needs.



?



Somewhere recently I saw reference to the suggestion or proposal that



adult education teachers be subject to qualification much as K-12



teachers are.? This can only be a good thing for our learners.



?



And as for LD issues, I know for a well-documented fact that having a



tutor or teacher who is well meant and kind but does not "get" LD and



language learning challenges is actually worse for the learner than



just sitting in a class and trying to absorb something.



?



Just as for learners, having high expectations for teachers and tutors



is critical to having an effective program.



?



As a start for ESOL and learning challengs,? programs might want to



look at the handbook : Taking Action: A Handbook for Instructors of



Adult ESOL Learners with Learning Dissablities"? produced and



distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities Association (visit



www.ldaminnesota.org to find it).? This walks teachers through the



topic of LD and an approach to determining if other problems might be



at the root of learning difficulties.



?



There is also a great handbook for tutors teaching reading to



English-speaking adults? called The Adult Reading Toolkit ( ART)



?



Both of these are designed for tutors and teachers who have little



prior knowledge on the topic--and they are extremely user-friendly and



beautifully thought out.?? --And no, I don't have any financial



interest in them......



?

It isn't so much about lowering your expectations. Rather, enter into 
your relationship with a student with no expectations and appreciate 
whatever outcomes may rise out of that relationship. The student will 
begin to form his or her own expectations, which are OK.

In public K-12 education, it is a mantra taught to all beginning 
teachers: you must have high expectations for your students and they 
will rise to meet them. Research has been designed to show that this is 
indeed the case. It is the paradigm in public education, and it is a 
line of thinking that is fundamentally flawed, in my opinion. The 
problems with expectations are that students usually only work to meet 
the expectations and not go any further. They are the foundation for the 
measurement of success and failure in schools. They create a system in 
which students work (or not) to try to meet the expectations of their 
teachers and not for the intrinsic benefits of learning for its own 
sake. One very unfortunate outcome of this is the student's education 
becomes directed others and not the by the student. It is 
teacher-centered, not student-centered. When a student fails to meet the 
teacher's expectations, it is said the student did not learn, which is 
very clearly not the case. In extreme situations, failure to learn has a 
name: learning disability. As I'm sure you've noticed in corrections 
education, these are our guys. They come from a lifetime of failure to 
meet teachers' expectations.

In a no-expectations paradigm, the teacher would not attempt to define a 
set of learning objectives and decide whether they had been met. 
Instead, the teacher would try to identify what learning did occur and 
see how it fits with the school's overall curriculum. Immediately, there 
is no such thing as failure in this system. There is only learning. It 
progresses according to the student's expectations of him- or herself. 
If a teacher can work in this setting, all learning is valued. There 
would not be disappointment if it doesn't progress the way the teacher 
would like it to. Oops. That would mean there is a teacher-expectation.

What I've found K-12 teachers look at me like I come from another planet 
if I start talking to them about trying to not have expectations for 
their students. The mindset of having high expectations is so ingrained, 
so supported by research, and so much a part of our educational 
tradition that it is extremely difficult to break out. Still there are 
hints of it in the traditions of progressive education, of the 
Summerhill School in England, and of the Sudbury Valley School in MA. I 
also know from my own experience, it works. Kids who were completely 
turned off by their past experiences get so pumped they will move 
mountains to get their diplomas . It begins with doing away with teacher 
expectations and allowing the student to begin to form them for him- or 
herself.

I apologize for the long winded treatise, but expectations are a 
hot-button item for me, as I'm sure you have guessed.

Hi All,

Thank you all so much for your input during this past week's discussion
of struggling ESOL learners. And HUGE thanks to Robin for sharing her
experience and knowledge with us all. I especially appreciated the
specific, practical advice she was able to give that stemmed from years
of study and research, and the geniune sense of caring for the learners
that so clearly guides her attitude and methods of teaching. 

We can all still continue this discussion, but we gratefully say goodbye
to Robin with thanks for answering our questions and concerns so fully.
I will go through the postings and compile all the specific links, book
titles, workbooks, etc. that were recommended as resources and have them
for you next week.

Thanks again,

Julie

Hello all,
Our center has just started to use the Power Path screening tool, and
have had positive feedback. We are an adult education center working
with students who are out of jail or involved in drug/alcohol treatment.
There is a high incidence of comorbidity: addictions + mental illness +
criminal history + learning difficulties. We suspect many have learning
"disabilities," but have no funds to get official diagnosis. 

Power Path has offered us a new approach toward our learners with
difficulties. It enables us to screen for auditory, visual and
information processing problems. But, most importantly, it goes a step
further, stressing "strategy" planning with the student. Power Path
reports provide strategies for students to overcome their barriers. A
systematic checking-in with the student allows for tracking of progress,
goal-setting and planning. In sum, we are able to help students develop
metacognitive skills that they need to succeed, instead of just
emphasizing students' deficiencies. 

It's so easy to get hung up on what we can't do as programs (pay for an
LD diagnosis, for example!).  But there's so much we can do better to
help our learners help themselves.  
Thank you all for this fine discussion on Focus on Basics!

Message-ID: <s3fdfef4.075@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,
Read on for details of an upcoming discussion of new technology in adult
education on the Technology and literacy discussion list.
-Julie

Hello NIFL discussion list colleagues,

Audio and video resources have been used in adult education instruction
for
many years, but the introduction of CDs, DVDs, the Internet, and other
electronic technologies has greatly expanded their availability and
raise
many questions about implementation, support annd training.

I'm pleased to announce that David Collings, Technology Coordinator for
the
Adult and Community Education Network in Delaware, and Alex Quinn,
Executive Director of the Adult Literacy Media Alliance (ALMA), will
join
the NIFL Technology list as guests to lead a discussion on  
current and emerging uses of media in adult ed. instruction in the
classroom and at a distance. Their discussion will take place next week
from Tuesday, February 28th through Friday March 3rd. Some of the areas
they will cover on this topic include: teacher training, technical
support
for teachers and learners, the challenges of their use, media
distribution,
and emerging uses and tools foor delivery of media. 

You are encouraged to participate, ask questions, and share you
experience
and knowledge.

Message-ID: <s3feef44.045@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,
I am passing on this message from Luri Owen to the list. (Maybe this is
the one that got lost in that weird glitch!) Sorry Luri!

Julie


Following this discussion has been both informative and fun!  Before
it's over, I'd like to invite comments on a proposal for a presentation
I will be making in April, which I hope will touch on many issues raised
in this discussion and for which I am thankful to NIFL for initiating
and to Robin for facilitating.  Here's the proposal:
 
"Adult ESOL students are capable of applying higher-order thinking
skills in the classroom but may hesitate to do so both because of how
they were conditioned to learn as young learners and at what
age/educational level they terminated schooling in their own countries. 
Teachers design activities requiring the use of higher-order thinking
skills, but students may not feel that they are ?working? or ?learning?
in class and may be unwilling to assume responsibility for their own
learning.  Teachers may perceive this hesitancy as differences in
individual personalities when, in fact, it may be learned ?school?
behavior.

            This presentation encourages teachers to explore and reflect
on their students? prior learning experiences, their expectations of
?school? and ?learning,? and the value their cultures place on education
and learning.  It will also open discussion on how these factors affect
the elementary and secondary children of adult ESOL students as they
experience American educational values and expectations. Participants
are encouraged to share their ideas and experiences for fostering
student ownership of the individual learning process, providing class
time and space for community-building in the classroom, and shifting
student perception of teacher-as-knower to teacher-as-guide.   This
presentation will incorporate research on teaching higher-order thinking
skills as well as the measurable and observable effects of
sociocognitive conflict in the classroom."
 
I was inspired to start thinking these issues by a student I had last
year who did well as long as she was attending class regularly, but
seemed to not be able to pick up and go forward from where we had
stopped if she was absent for a class.  Reading this discussion has
really made me aware that there could have been lots of things going on
in her situation that impacted her learning that I didn't consider at
the time.  
 
Thanks in advance to everybody!                      :)

Aliya,

You didn't say what kind of resources you are looking for exactly. If
you don't find what you are looking for, write back with more specifics,
and we can all try to help.

Have you used the LINCS database? It has a ton of literacy resources:

www.nifl.gov/lincs

>From this home page, you can click on "LincSearch" (left side of banner
on top) to search for different kinds of resources. You can also click
on the "LINCS Special Collections" to find nicely organized collections
of hand-picked resources within a specific topic area. I would recommend
especially the ESOL Special collection, but there are also collections
for Health Literacy, Family Literacy, Science and Numeracy, and many
others that have good teaching resources.

Good luck!

Julie

Hi All,

Just a reminder here to help us organize the information we share on the
list. Most of us find a message to reply to as an easy way of sending a
message to the list, instead of writing out the address in a new e-mail.
This is fine, but if you are starting a new topic of discussion or
asking a new question, please change the subject line to reflect your
new topic. This will make it easier to go back and find the information
later. (See the example in the previous few messages about online
resources.)

Of course, you can also start a new e-mail and send it to:

focusonbasics at nifl.gov

Thanks!

Julie

I have also taught in a correctional setting, although I taught low
level readers, not ESL learners.  I agree with all of your statements,
Tom - the correctional setting is so completely different than any other
kind of educational setting, and I agree with your ten things you have
learned about this kind of teaching.  

I think it helped me that I was in my forties, and therefore not out to
save the world.  I had a pretty realistic take on the barriers and
obstacles my learners were facing and would face when they left the
prison.  I felt comfortable being a positive teaching presence in their
lives, and was pretty happy with any little sign of accomplishment, no
matter what.  

Iris, we could label students FTP - Failure to Progress - when that was
indicated.  That way they didn't have to keep coming and thus taking the
place of someone who could learn and progress.  Sounds like you don't
have this option, which does make it tough.

It isn't so much about lowering your expectations. Rather, enter into 
your relationship with a student with no expectations and appreciate 
whatever outcomes may rise out of that relationship. The student will 
begin to form his or her own expectations, which are OK.

In public K-12 education, it is a mantra taught to all beginning 
teachers: you must have high expectations for your students and they 
will rise to meet them. Research has been designed to show that this is 
indeed the case. It is the paradigm in public education, and it is a 
line of thinking that is fundamentally flawed, in my opinion. The 
problems with expectations are that students usually only work to meet 
the expectations and not go any further. They are the foundation for the

measurement of success and failure in schools. They create a system in 
which students work (or not) to try to meet the expectations of their 
teachers and not for the intrinsic benefits of learning for its own 
sake. One very unfortunate outcome of this is the student's education 
becomes directed others and not the by the student. It is 
teacher-centered, not student-centered. When a student fails to meet the

teacher's expectations, it is said the student did not learn, which is 
very clearly not the case. In extreme situations, failure to learn has a

name: learning disability. As I'm sure you've noticed in corrections 
education, these are our guys. They come from a lifetime of failure to 
meet teachers' expectations.

In a no-expectations paradigm, the teacher would not attempt to define a

set of learning objectives and decide whether they had been met. 
Instead, the teacher would try to identify what learning did occur and 
see how it fits with the school's overall curriculum. Immediately, there

is no such thing as failure in this system. There is only learning. It 
progresses according to the student's expectations of him- or herself. 
If a teacher can work in this setting, all learning is valued. There 
would not be disappointment if it doesn't progress the way the teacher 
would like it to. Oops. That would mean there is a teacher-expectation.

What I've found K-12 teachers look at me like I come from another planet

if I start talking to them about trying to not have expectations for 
their students. The mindset of having high expectations is so ingrained,

so supported by research, and so much a part of our educational 
tradition that it is extremely difficult to break out. Still there are 
hints of it in the traditions of progressive education, of the 
Summerhill School in England, and of the Sudbury Valley School in MA. I 
also know from my own experience, it works. Kids who were completely 
turned off by their past experiences get so pumped they will move 
mountains to get their diplomas . It begins with doing away with teacher

expectations and allowing the student to begin to form them for him- or 
herself.

I apologize for the long winded treatise, but expectations are a 
hot-button item for me, as I'm sure you have guessed.

Tom

Hi Iris,

I can't remember the name of the first researcher who did   a study on 
low/high teacher expectations and their self-fulling prophecy, but I do remember the 
study.   The resaercher got his data by lying to the teacher about the 
ability of her students.   (Maybe more than one teacher, I can't remember now.)

When I read that I kind of stopped cold.   Toally unethical, of course.

It was the idea of lying to the teacher that I found so shocking.   What can 
I say;   I was very young.

Andrea.

It is very important to have some kind of system to prioritize so you 
can deliver what resources you have to where they will do the most good. 
We go by age and graduation status because state law makes school 
mandatory for those under 22 y.o. without a diploma while they are 
incarcerated. Older inmates and HS grads may have to go on a waiting 
list. I really hate to turn anyone away, especially if they want to come 
voluntarily. We seldom have to, but even for those who do have to wait, 
transfers to and from our facility are so high that the wait to get in 
is not a long one. While this is fortunate from the standpoint of those 
who may have to wait to get in a class, it poses an altogether different 
set of problems when trying to plan instruction for a group of students 
who were in your class yesterday, but may not be with you today.

	School Team
Message-ID: <s4030d05.077@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,

Guess what*we have another guest discussion starting tomorrow!
A team of researchers/authors from the Lab School will discuss their articles from the recent FOB issue on ESOL Research (Vol. 8A). 

This discussion will include information about the Lab School itself, and several research projects that were done there involving student-to-student language and interaction, and a modified reading technique in beginning level adult ESOL classes. Many of the topics overlap, so it will be great to have these researchers lead the discussion as a team. 

The articles and authors include:

The "Lab School"
By Steve Reder
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=987

Hi * my name is Steve Reder.  I wrote the article entitled "The 'Lab School'" that provides an overview of the purpose, design and work of the lab school.  I'm a professor and chair of the Department of Applied Linguistics at Portland State University and the Principal Investigator of NCSALL's Adult ESOL Labsite (aka "Lab School") project.  My research and teaching interests are in the areas of adult literacy and second language development.  When you have a question for me, please put "Steve?overall lab school" in the subject line and I'll try to address your question.  I'm looking forward to our discussion.

Same Activity, Different Focus [Pair Activities]
By Kathryn Harris
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=988

My name is Kathy Harris and I wrote the article called "Same activity,
different focus".  I am a researcher at the adult ESOL Lab School and a
faculty member at the Portland State University Dept of Applied Linguistics.
I teach courses to pre-service teachers who want to work with ESL learners
in the context of the United States and other countries.  In my research at
the Lab School I am trying to clarify the relationship between the way that
teachers design pair activities and the ways that the students interact in
them, as well as the ways that student interaction in pair activities
supports language learning.   

When you have a question for me, please say "Kathy--pair work" in the
subject line and I'll do my best to address your question.  I look forward
to our discussion!

A Conversation with FOB: Modified Sustained Silent Reading
By Sandra Banke and Reuel Kurzet
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=990

My name is Sandra Banke.  I and my colleague, Reuel Kurzet, were interviewed
by
Barbara Garner, editor of FOB, about the experience of implementing
Sustained
Silent Reading with beginning adult learners in "A Conversation with FOB."
I
am an English as a Second Language instructor for Portland Community
College. 
I've been teaching adult learners of ESL in the Portland area for over 10
years. I am also a research-associate for the Adult ESOL Lab School at
Portland State University.  Since 2001, as part of my work with the Lab School, all
of my classes have been digitally recorded and transcribed for research purposes.
My professional interests include interaction in pair activities (in
collaboration with Kathy Harris), reading instruction, and professional development.

If you have a question regarding the use of SSR with beginning adult
learners of ESL, please write "Reuel or Sandra - SSR" in the subject line.  I look
forward to a stimulating discussion.

Rewarding Conversations
By Betsy Kraft
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=991

My name is Betsy Kraft, and I wrote the article called "Rewarding
Conversations". I teach a class at Portland State University where university
seniors are conversation partners with English Language Learners at Portland
Community College. The partnership began in the Lab School, where many sessions
were video taped, and has since moved to one of the other community college
sites. In their coursework, the university students learn strategies for
working with ELL students and issues pertaining to immigration. If you want to
talk about conversation partnerships, write "Betsy - conversation partnerships"
in the subject line.

Spontaneous Conversations: A Window into Language Learners' Autonomy
By Dominique Brillanceau
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=992

My name is Dominique Brillanceau  and I wrote the article called "
Spontaneous Conversations".  I have been an ESL instructor  in the Portland
area for the past 20 years and at the labschool for the past 5 years. I'm
also a researcher associate at the labschool.  The focus of my research in
this particular article is to understand learning in the classroom
specifically when it occurs outside of a teacher-set activity. Watching hours
of authentic classroom video has allowed me to rethink learning and teaching
in ways not otherwise possible. Hopefully this article begins to share what I
have seen.

Turn Taking and Opening Interactions
By John Hellermann
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=993

My name is John Hellermann and I wrote the article called "Turn taking in adult
ESOL classroom interaction: Practices for interaction in another language".  I
am a researcher at the adult ESOL Lab School and a faculty member at the
Portland State University Applied Linguistics Dept.

My research at the Lab School investigates conversational practices that occur
in the language learning classroom which are usually invisible to teachers. My
goal is to show how learning can be understood as learners change in
participation in these conversational practices.

When you have a question for me, please write "John?turn taking" in the
subject line.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <003301c63c8f$f5257360$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

Visit the new Practitioner Research, Practitioner Knowledge section of
NCSALL's Web site at http://www.ncsall.net/?id=967. Find out how
practitioners learn about new research and then inquire about how this
research might be used in their own practice. 

 

Teachers in the Northwest Practitioner Knowledge Institute learned about ESL
research, made a change in their own practice, documented what happened when
they made the change, and shared this knowledge in final reports. They
developed and documented "practitioner knowledge" developed from learning
about others' research. 

 

Teachers in the Minnesota Practitioner Research in Reading Project and the
Practitioner Dissemination and Research Network learned about others'
research and also conducted research of their own. After learning about new
research findings in reading or learner persistence, these teachers
developed a research question on one of these topics, planned an
intervention or change in their own practice, collected data on what
happened as a result, analyzed these data and reported their findings.

professional
development associate. I do research on professional development and
help to
create professional development opportunities around the research coming
out of
the Lab School. My professional interests include student pair and small
group
activities, reading instruction, and professional development.

If you have a question regarding the use of Sustained Silent Reading
with
beginning adult ESOL learners, please write "Reuel or Sandra--SSR" in

Hello Barbara-
Sandra and Dominique here.  Yes, we were video-taped during the year that we did
the experiment with Sustained Silent Reading.  However, we, the instructors, did
not view the media to monitor the implementation of either condition as we were
involved with other data-collection projects.  We *did* reflect on our teaching
every day in an audio-recorded "debrief session."  As with any reflection, we
found ourselves refining and altering our practice, keeping in mind the
constraints of the condition that we were teaching in a given quarter
(experimental/modified-SSR or control/conventional reading instruction).  These
"audio-logs"  have been digitally catalogued and stored with its corresponding
class session's video.

Dominique and Sandra

Hi Steve and the rest of the team,

I have a question about the Lab School itself. It seems that you have an
incredibly unique situation in that you can watch (through video) what
happens in the ESOL classroom between the students at any given time. So
you can observe what the teacher cannot see, for example how students
interact when doing pair work or other tasks when the teacher is not
interacting with them. 

So you have this capability, and thousands (?) of hours of recorded data
of this type. How do you decide what research to use this data for? How
do you pick which specific questions to pose?

Thanks,

Julie McKinney

Good question, Julie.  We do have a lot of video data that we believe can be
very useful for a variety of research topics and for professional
development purposes in our field.  Our intention in designing the lab
school was for this large compilation of data to be a rich resource not only
for our work but for others in our field as well.  We have developed
software tools that enable others -- whether in Portland or elsewhere on the
Internet -- to access these data to conduct their own research or create
their own teacher training materials.  

We picked our initial research questions based on our team's collective
experience as ESL teachers and researchers.  Our decisions were helped along
by reviewing previous research in the field, by input from programs and
practitioners, and from an expert advisory group.  We settled on several
strands of research that we thought would be very useful additions to the
base of knowledge in our field.

Two of our major strands or questions are: (1) How do interactions between
students in beginning level classes contribute to learning English (and how
can teachers setup activities to facilitate student-student interactions and
learning)?  (2) How do individual students, when followed over time,
progress in their acquisition of English.  Examples of studies in each of
these strands can be seen in the FOB articles by Kathy Harris and John
Hellermann.

Other researchers, teachers and professional developers are starting to work
with our media and data on their own questions and around their own
interests.  We're eager to hear from others who may have questions or ideas
about how to use this resource in their teaching, research or professional
development materials.

Message-ID: <200603032027.k23KRuEj016970@njord.oit.pdx.edu>

Hi list members,  this is Kathy, one of the authors in the recent FOB issue.
I'd like to pose a question to you all.

 

Here at the lab school we have a unique view of ESOL classrooms because we
have cameras that record classes-not just a few minutes of classrooms, but
every minute of every day.  Jokingly, we call our video "reality classrooms"
like the reality shows on TV.  Using the video we have a perspective that
isn't usually available to teachers and researchers.

 

We use the recordings to do our research on learning and teaching.  We also
use the recordings to do professional development and to illustrate our
research, as in this FOB issue.

 

Please pick any clip that is part of the FOB issue.  Then answer the
question, how does this video clip help me understand the research or help
me understand the students in my classroom?

 

Here is the link to the FOB issue.  Each of the articles has a link to clips
in it.  In encourage you to choose clips from the article that is most
relevant to your work context.  http://www.ncsall.net/?id=986

 

 

Your answers will really help me make my work more accessible to others.

 

Thanks!
Kathy

Hi All,

Here is the compilation of links, book names, etc. from the discussion
on Struggling ESOL Learners with Robin Schwarz. (Let me know if you want
a formatted version, and I can send it as an attachment.)

Resources from Robin's Discussion:


Phonemic Awareness Resources

"How Now Brown Cow: Phoneme Awareness Activities for Collaborative 
Classrooms"
 by Patricia J. Edelen-Smith. Published in Intervention in School and
Clinic in 1997Vol 33 #2

Try googling "Phonemic Awareness"


Books and Workbooks 

"Pronunciation Contrasts in English"
by D L. F. Nilsen and A. P. Nilsen. (recently reprinted)
(It is a book of all the minimal pairs in English-- and each 
page includes a diagram of the mouth for each sound, plus a list of all 
the languages for which that contrast is a a difficulty.)

"Listening Dictation"
by Joan Morley
It has lessons designed to help learners hear specific words and
structures in sentences and to pay attention to prepositions and other
small words that learners of English tend to miss.   It addresses all
four skills, too, listening, speaking, writing and reading.

"Taking Action: A Handbook for Instructors of Adult ESOL Learners with
Learning Dissablities"
produced and distrbuted by the Minnesota Learning Disabilities
Association 
www.ldaminnesota.org
This walks teachers through the topic of LD and an approach to
determining if other problems might be at the root of learning
difficulties.

"The Adult Reading Toolkit ( ART)"
A great handbook for tutors teaching reading to English-speaking adults.

"English Sounds and Spelling"
by McClelland, Hale and Beaudikofer 
(no longer in print, but available on the internet.)
It is a very straightforward English (ESL) phonics books, but it has
many great line drawings of words ESL learners need to know that can be
cut up and used 
for many kinds of practice.  The actual phonics lessons are good, but 
presume a certain level of other-language literacy, as most ESL phonics 
books do.


Programs and Screenings

The Beery Test of Visual Motor Integration  (VMI) 
It involves copying geometric figures and is remarkably diagnostic for
problems of copying things accurately. You can probably get a version of
it by googling.

The Hull Screening 
(Was available in MA, but is hard to get hold of.)
This has a version of the VMI, too. 

www.irlen.com
A self test for visual linked stress syndrome, and forms for ordering
colored overlays. (But beware--when you open that site, it starts with
an example of what many people see!!!)  .    

Organization:

ProLiteracy
Creates training programs for new tutors because literacy providers know
that 
if tutors are untrained, learners cannot progress and will not persist.

Hello Aliya,

I'm sorry that I missed your reply which you sent nearly a fortnight ago. 
You confirm our suspicions that concepts are not being taught properly, and 
that a definitive guide to synthetic phonics, and all aspects of teaching 
it, is needed.   We are discussing the production of such a guide.

Best wishes,

John

Message-ID: <s40d6bb7.081@mail.jsi.com>

These video clips are really interesting to see!

I would encourage everyone to try to view one or two of these clips. It
gives a much clearer understanding of what the Lab School can study, and
what happens in those precious classroom moments that are unencumbered
by teacher presence.

The technology (like all technology!) is a bit funky, but it's worth it
if you can persevere through it. When you put in a URL for one of the
video clips, your computer will prompt you to install the ClassAction
software (from Portland State U.) which allows you to view the clips.
Then follow the instructions and click on "Agree" and then "Clip". 

Please try to see one, and answer back with any thoughts on how it
allows you to understand your class, or this research any differently!
See below for the video clip URLs that go with the FOB research
articles.

Hi list members,  this is Kathy, one of the authors in the recent FOB
issue.
I'd like to pose a question to you all.

 

Here at the lab school we have a unique view of ESOL classrooms because
we
have cameras that record classes-not just a few minutes of classrooms,
but
every minute of every day.  Jokingly, we call our video "reality
classrooms"
like the reality shows on TV.  Using the video we have a perspective
that
isn't usually available to teachers and researchers.

 

We use the recordings to do our research on learning and teaching.  We
also
use the recordings to do professional development and to illustrate our
research, as in this FOB issue.

 

Please pick any clip that is part of the FOB issue.  Then answer the
question, how does this video clip help me understand the research or
help
me understand the students in my classroom?

 

Here is the link to the FOB issue.  Each of the articles has a link to
clips
in it.  In encourage you to choose clips from the article that is most
relevant to your work context.  http://www.ncsall.net/?id=986

 

 

Your answers will really help me make my work more accessible to others.

 

Thanks!
Kathy

Skills for Chronic Disease Management 

by Rima Rudd, Lisa Soricone, Maricel Santos, Charlotte Nath, and Janet Smith
is now available from NCSALL.

 

The goal of this 15-hour study circle+ is to prepare participants to help
their students develop basic skills needed for chronic disease management.
These skills include reading medicine labels, following directions, and
measuring dosages correctly; using measurement tools to monitor health;
monitoring symptoms and talking to health care professionals the

Hi All,

After this message is one from Robin Schwarz called "a lament". I just
wanted to put it in context because it is in response to some discussion
a couple weeks ago. It is in response to Iris and Andrea talking about
studies on teacher expectaions. By the way, please feel free to keep
discussing any of this!

Thanks,

Julie

Well why not look at a study from Kentucky about the effect of teacher 
expectations on high school students.  No lying involved.   In this 
study, two teachers were prepared in exactly the same way to do a new 
program ( I believe it was in science).  The idea of the study was to 
see if the program helped the students, but to the surprise of the 
researchers the two classes achieved quite different results.  The only 
factor that could be identified that influenced the results was teacher 
expectation--the students of the teacher who was sure her students 
could do this new, challenging work did very well, while the students 
of the other teacher, who was sure the students would not get it, did 
relatively poorly.  This is not news.  This is what is known as a self- 
fulfilling prophecy.

Studies were done in the 70's on the effect of labeling students on 
teachers' expectations of the students.  Needless to say, the 
expectations shifted drastically down when students were identified as 
special needs in any way.

Recent ( January) visits to several K-12 schools confirmed that this 
attitude is alive and well among a lot of teachers and sped teachers.

Hi Iris,

I can't remember the name of the first researcher who did? a study on 
low/high teacher expectations and their self-fulling prophecy, but I do 
remember the study.? The resaercher got his data by lying to the 
teacher about the ability of her students.? (Maybe more than one 
teacher, I can't remember now.)

When I read that I kind of stopped cold.? Toally unethical, of course.

It was the idea of lying to the teacher that I found so shocking.? What 
can I say;? I was very young.

Andrea.

Hi All,

I want to thank the Lab School Team for being available, for sharing
their research through FOB, and for introducing us to the video clips of
classroom interactions and the concept of studying these hidden gems.

Although the discussion "week" is over, any questions or comments about
the team's work and their articles will still be welcome! (After all,
they are the bulk of the last FOB issue.) 

Thank you,

Julie

There have been studies on parental expectations too: if you expect your child to graduate, he or she will.  This reminds me of that movie about the math teacher in LA, can't remember the name of it, but his students completed higher math course and passed tests, but the administration didn't believe the results.  I think standards, from many angles, are vastly important.

The movie was Stand and Deliver, and it is an excellent film.  I used it
in one of my ESL speaking and listening classes when I taught grad
students already enrolled in degree programs.  It's a great film.

A new study just came out, The Color of Success, by Gilberto Conchas.  He's a sociologist who studied an urban high school which is successful at getting minority students to graduate and go on to college.  What he found is that detracking, career academies and high teacher and parent expectations were key to the success of these students.  
   
  The high achievement of the Vietnamese students was the most surprising, as these students had none of the educational or economic advantages usually associated with Asian students.  However, they were still treated as "the model minority" by the school and rose to meet the high expectations placed on them.

The importance of teacher expectations and student ability hit home for me  recently at a professional development event I attended. I was fortunate enough to be in an environment with a majority of curriculum instructors. There were only 5 Adult Educational Professionals at the event - and it was eye opening for all of us. One of the things that came up was "differently abled" students. A curriculum instructor commented on how she had a student who was handicapped - if memory serves, the student has Tourettes Syndrome,  and how difficult it was for him to meet her expectations. She had already decided he could not perform in her class. Another instructor had taught the same student a previous semester and had a totally different experience with the student. He was well pleased with the student's performance and talked about how with the right structure, the student just thrived.  From a third person in the group, the comment came "Sometimes, you just go ahead and accept that differently abled student is going to fail at a certain point". I was appalled. to hear any instructor say that.  It still bothers me. I pointed out, when I had the chance to speak, that Basic Skills teachers deal with the learning disabled and physically disbaled daily and sometimes our students don't even know they have a learning disability but that we help our students achieve success by meeting the student needs not by having the student meet our needs.  This comment met with some very mixed reactions and alot of "Well, we just can't do that in curriculum or I don't have the time to adjust my teaching style for one student."

Teacher expectations go a long way in student performance. If you as a teacher believe in your students, your students will find more and more reason to believe in themselves and you'll see their achievement climb.

This is a great conversation. I totally agree that teacher expectations are crucial to achievement. 

It's not simple, however. For example, my child's first grade teacher, a well traine reading teacher with no knowledge of second language learners, has very high expectations for all her students. She had a number of second language speaking kids the year my child was in her class. These kids, children of scientists, were fluent in first grade classroom English and "reading" ahead of their grade. Because they did so well and because she hadn't received any training in second language reading, she failed to realize that they had huge gaps in their vocabulary. I noticed it when volunteering in the reading program. I knew they spoke Chinese at home and so, as a former ESOL teacher, I wondered if their comprehension matched their decoding skills.

The point I'm trying to make is that while having high expectations, we need to be aware of the possible "blind spots" we may have to certain students' learning needs.

I believe that having high expectations does, in fact, result in high 
performance for many students because many students will work extremely 
hard to please the people around them.  It's the students for whom it 
does not work well that concern me and there are many of them.

I get concerned about who forms the expectations. When we say teachers 
should have high expectations for their students, I take that to mean I 
should expect my student to perform well at the challenges I provide. He 
or she performs at the level I expect. Personally I see that as me being 
rather arrogant because I presume to know more about what my student 
needs to know than my student does.

A traditional American Indian view is that we should not have 
expectations for others, that "expect" and "respect" are diametrically 
opposed. Perhaps this helps explain why so many American Indian children 
do poorly in our modern school systems and they drop out at extremely 
high rates.

A different twist to this topic is students' high expectations of 
themselves. This is far more important and more healthy in my view. I 
feel I can encourage students to develop their own high expectations and 
experience very positive results, but it shifts the emphasis from 
teacher to student.

So often in the field of education we hear about the need to make 
learning student-centered instead of teacher-centered. I believe deeply 
that this begins with the question, who holds the expectations?

Barb,

The study seems very interesting.  Would you please provide the complete reference?

A new study just came out, The Color of Success, by Gilberto Conchas.  He's a sociologist who studied an urban high school which is successful at getting minority students to graduate and go on to college.  What he found is that detracking, career academies and high teacher and parent expectations were key to the success of these students.  

The high achievement of the Vietnamese students was the most surprising, as these students had none of the educational or economic advantages usually associated with Asian students.  However, they were still treated as "the model minority" by the school and rose to meet the high expectations placed on them.

Well why not look at a study from Kent ucky about the effect of teacher 
expectations on high school students.  No lying involved.   In this 
study, two teachers were prepared in exactly the same way to do a new 
program ( I believe it was in science).  The idea of the study was to 
see if the program helped the students, but to the surprise of the 
researchers the two classes achieved quite different results.  The only 
factor that could be identified that influenced the results was teacher 
expectation--the students of the teacher who was sure her students 
could do this new, challenging work did very well, while the students 
of the other teacher, who was sure the students would not get it, did 
relatively poorly.  This is not news.  This is what is known as a self- 
fulfilling prophecy.
 
Studies were done in the 70's on the effect of labeling students on 
teachers' expectations of the students.  Needless to say, the 
expectations shifted drastically down when students were identified as 
special needs in any way.
 
Recent ( January) visits to several K-12 schools confirmed that this 
attitude is alive and well among a lot of teachers and sped teachers.

I can't remember the name of the first researcher who did  a study on 
low/high teacher expectations and their self-fulling prophecy, but I do 
remember the study.  The resaercher got his data by lyi ng to the 
teacher about the ability of her students.  (Maybe more than one

I agree with you Barbara. It is very important for the student to believe that they can accomplish the challenges they are given. It is the teachers job to encourage,  find levels they can perform successfully; and have positive experiences until they can believe in themselves.

I  think one of the things to consider is that often adult students have had very little success in school before coming to us and that one of the first things they need to know is that someone believes in them - believes he/she can be successful etc.  I agree that our students expectations of themselves is very important - at the same time, some of them don't even know where to begin to create that expectation and they can learn to have their own personal expectations from having teachers that believe in them and help them make connections for themselves to find their own success. For some adult students, their self esteem has been so badly damaged by encountering people who expect nothing or who assume that they are incapable of learning that the student has learned to internalize that as "I'm stupid" or "I can't learn" when in actuality, all they really needed was a teacher that knew how to put a student on the right path.

Expectations need to work both ways. The student needs to have expectations for him or herself; the teacher also needs to expect the student to be able to achieve and to find ways to encourage and nurture that success.

Once again I must disagree with Tom about the interpretation of 
expectations. It should not be about OUR expecatations, but rather 
those of the learners.  I think that what is needed is an expectation 
that the learner can learn, no matter what, and WANTS to learn 
something or do better at something and is trying hard.   Learners 
quickly sense when there are no expectations for them and may feel 
either let down or confirmed that they do not have hope of learning.    
It is perhaps splitting hairs here, but to me the difference in 
thinking learners must meet OUR expectations and having expectations 
that learners want to learn is very different.   Robin S.

Virginia -- that movie was "Stand and Deliver"-- one of my all-time
favorite movies--and a mostly-true story, too-- and yes--this teacher
had very high standards for the Spanish speaking students and made sure
they got the support and instruction they needed to fill in the gaps
they had in trying to meet his expectations.  It is such an inspiring
movie.   It also gives clear pictures of challenges  many ELL/CLD
learners' face both in school and out-- taking care of siblings while
parents work, parents who don't understand American school demands,
kids who must themselves work, peer pressure, teachers who do not

Well why not look at a study from Kentucky about the effect of teacher
expectations on high school students.  No lying involved.   In this
study, two teachers were prepared in exactly the same way to do a new
program ( I believe it was in science).  The idea of the study was to
see if the program helped the students, but to the surprise of the
researchers the two classes achieved quite different results.  The only
factor that could be identified that influenced the results was teacher
expectation--the students of the teacher who was sure her students
could do this new, challenging work did very well, while the students
of the other teacher, who was sure the students would not get it, did
relatively poorly.  This is not news.  This is what is known as a self-
fulfilling prophecy.

Studies were done in the 70's on the effect of labeling students on
teachers' expectations of the students.  Needless to say, the
expectations shifted drastically down when students were identified as
special needs in any way.

Recent ( January) visits to several K-12 schools confirmed that this
attitude is alive and well among a lot of teachers and sped teachers.

Hi Iris,

I can't remember the name of the first researcher who did? a study on
low/high teacher expectations and their self-fulling prophecy, but I do
remember the study.? The resaercher got his data by lying to the
teacher about the ability of her students.? (Maybe more than one
teacher, I can't remember now.)

When I read that I kind of stopped cold.? Toally unethical, of course.

It was the idea of lying to the teacher that I found so shocking.? What
can I say;? I was very young.

Andrea.

Subject: Re: [FocusOnBasics] high expectations, with radar out...

I  think one of the things to consider is that often adult students 
have had
very little success in school before coming to us and that one of the 
first
things they need to know is that someone believes in them - believes 
he/she can
be successful etc.  I agree that our students expectations of 
themselves is very
important - at the same time, some of them don't even know where to 
begin to
create that expectation and they can learn to have their own personal
expectations from having teachers that believe in them and help them 
make
connections for themselves to find their own success. For some adult 
students,
their self esteem has been so badly damaged by encountering people who 
expect
nothing or who assume that they are incapable of learning that the 
student has
learned to internalize that as "I'm stupid" or "I can't learn" when in
actuality, all they really needed was a teacher that knew how to put a 
student
on the right path.

Expectations need to work both ways. The student needs to have 
expectations for
him or herself; the teacher also needs to expect the student to be able 
to
achieve and to find ways to encourage and nurture that success.

Katrina Hinson

I believe that having high expectations does, in fact, result in high
performance for many students because many students will work extremely
hard to please the people around them.  It's the students for whom it
does not work well that concern me and there are many of them.

I get concerned about who forms the expectations. When we say teachers
should have high expectations for their students, I take that to mean I
should expect my student to perform well at the challenges I provide. 
He
or she performs at the level I expect. Personally I see that as me 
being
rather arrogant because I presume to know more about what my student
needs to know than my student does.

A traditional American Indian view is that we should not have
expectations for others, that "expect" and "respect" are diametrically
opposed. Perhaps this helps explain why so many American Indian 
children
do poorly in our modern school systems and they drop out at extremely
high rates.

A different twist to this topic is students' high expectations of
themselves. This is far more important and more healthy in my view. I
feel I can encourage students to develop their own high expectations 
and
experience very positive results, but it shifts the emphasis from
teacher to student.

So often in the field of education we hear about the need to make
learning student-centered instead of teacher-centered. I believe deeply
that this begins with the question, who holds the expectations?

A new study just came out, The Color of Success, by Gilberto Conchas.
He's a sociologist who studied an urban high school which is successful
at getting minority students to graduate and go on to college.  What he
found is that detracking, career academies and high teacher and parent
expectations were key to the success of these students.  
 
The high achievement of the Vietnamese students was the most surprising,
as these students had none of the educational or economic advantages
usually associated with Asian students.  However, they were still
treated as "the model minority" by the school and rose to meet the high
expectations placed on them.

Wanda,
NCSALL has a book, "Understanding What Reading is All About," that offers 13 lessons designed to help learners understand the components of reading that are part of becoming a more fluent reader. The lessons can be used as an independent mini-course or be integrated into an existing curriculum. Go to www.ncsall.net/fileadmin/resources/teach/uwriaa.pdf

Two issues of "Focus on Basics" offer guidance on adult reading. Volume 1, Issue B, http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=167 is on reading in general.
Volume 5, Issue A, http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=147
is on first level readers. 

I'm sure other list members have favorite materials and places on the Internet to share as well.

Check out the ART-- Adult Reading Toolkit -- produced by Minnesota 
LDA-- I think the website is minnesotalda.org--if not, google it--This 
is another extremely well designed book from LDA Minnesota that is for 
tutors who do not know a lot about reading and are teaching low level 
learners (though the book contains information about higher level 
learners too)  It includes a lot of the teaching materials needed, plus 
research-based lesson plans etc.  A terrific tool--but NOT for 
beginning ESOL , in case any one is wondering!    Robin Schwarz

Message-ID: <s430ea1e.021@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,

As you know, the FOB Evaluation is complete and highlights the variety of ways that it impacts its readers. Barb Garner, FOB's editor, will lead a discussion on the list the week of April 10-14 to discuss the survey results and how these results can guide our use of FOB as professionals. Please take a look at the evaluation and think about comments or questions you may have. I'll post some questions by Wednesday.

Julie

************************************************************************

The evaluation results are available on the NCSALL Web site at:

 http://www.ncsall.net/?id=29#27

To order a printed version ($10), go to:

 http://www.ncsall.net/?id=681. 

SNEAK PREVIEW: The findings were overwhelmingly upbeat. The 292 readers who completed the survey report that Focus on Basics has had a positive impact in the following ways:

* It has influenced their beliefs about adult basic education.

* It has helped them feel connected to the larger education community as professionals.

* It has contributed to the development of communities of practice.

* It has enabled them to make a connection between research and practice.

* It has provided them with concrete ideas they have used to change their programs and practice.

 

Four in-depth interviews with professional development providers are included as well.

 

Read the report to find out more about how the publication is and can be used as a professional development tool.

	Evaluation
Message-ID: <s433fbee.063@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,

Barb Garner will join us next week to discuss the findings of the
evaluation of FOB. The results were very encouraging, with a few
surprises and a lot to be discussed about how we can use FOB in our
work.

You can find the Evaluation Report at:
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=29#27 

Below are some questions to think about as we prepare for this
discussion.

1. How do you use FOB in your professional life?

2. Have you ever used FOB for professional development? How?

3. Did the findings of this report change or add to your concept of FOB,
or your thoughts on how your program can use it?

4. Were any of the findings surprising to you in any way?

5. Reportedly, 72% of respondents interact with colleagues about what
they read in FOB. In what ways do you do this, and how does it affect
your work?

6. The report indicates that FOB "helps to create professionals; it
provides practitioners with the sense that they are not working in
isolation." How important is this to you and others in your program?

7. According to written comments from the survey, readers want more
online discussions, workshops and study circles to reflect and share
what they read in FOB. How can this discussion list 
help to meet this need better?

I'll looking forward to the discussion this week for more indepth information than a survey can offer (although we had pages and pages of responses to the open ended question. Thanks again to all who completed the survey).

One question we didn't ask in the survey...One of my pleasures in putting together each issue is working with Mary, our illustrator, to conceptualize art to accompany the text. It's not easy coming up with concrete ideas to illustrate often abstract concepts. What reactions do you have to the art work?

Message-ID: <12275478.1046541144698424063.JavaMail.root@vms171.mailsrvcs.net>

I'm recruiting for editorial board members for what might be the last issue of "Focus on Basics." A familiarity with research (quant or qualitative), a critical eye, and some experience as an ABE or ESOL teacher would be great.
The issue will feature research reports from a number of NCSALL researchers: one on health and literacy, one on post GED activities, one on reading, to name a few...
The work will start sometime in May and continue sporadically through September. We meet by phone to discuss the articles, setting our call schedule to suit participants (it has worked nicely to settle on a weekly meeting time, but that may be impossible in the summer). 
If a former ed board member could chime in to let list subscribers know what the experience is like, that would be great.
I select based on geography (states that have been underrepresented on the board get priority) and otherwise on a first come first serve basis...A small stipend is provided.
Email me on the list or off (off: b.garner4 at verizon.net)
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Thanks,
Barb Garner
Editor, Focus on Basics

I'm glad you asked about the illustrations, Barb, because I really liked
them.  The Lab School drawing on the cover of 8A is quite clever!  I like,
too, how Mary included some of the actual vocabulary that was discussed in
the articles in the drawings.

I think that the artwork is a real nice touch.  It makes FOB seem more
accessible, more inviting.

I like this publication very much.  I read all the issues and find them
useful and informative.  The last article I used actively was Robin
Schwarz' article on the struggling ESL learner.  We asked our new
teachers to read it prior to their New Teacher Training.  It was a great
article that generated a lot of discussion and hopefully raised the
level of awareness of these potential learner problems.  Keep up the
good work.

Thanks, Missy,,,
That struggling ESOL learner article really struck a chord. 

When you've been working in a field---any field---for awhile, it's easy to forget how much you actually have learned and apply on a day-to-day basis. Robin's article seems to have reminded us that new staff, or experienced staff working with new types of learners, need information that may have become second nature to some.

What other articles to folks use with new teachers, and why?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 209] Using FOB / Editorial Board

Not a lot of folks (none...) jumping in to the discussion about the
evaluation of "Focus on Basics..."

The evaluation documented the many ways folks use the publication. Which
issue did you use most recently. How, and why?

Barb Garner
Editor, FOB

(PS, thanks to those who have come forth for the next editorial board.
I'm still taking names and will get back to everyone at the end of the
week. Oklahoma, Michigan, Delaware, you've been underrepresented...Is
there anyone on the list who from those states interested in joining the
editorial board?)

Hi Barb:
 
I like the illustrations, too. I particularly liked the one from September
2003 that showed authentic materials like invoices and soup cans flying in
the window. Or were they flying out the window??
 
I also liked the way you used portions of the cover illustration inside the
publication to send visual cues that the inside article was related to the
cover story.
 
You're right: it's always a creative challenge to illustrate an abstract
concept in a concrete manner. The recently released NAAL is a good example.
We're blessed to have a talented and creative graphic artist on our staff
who helps us with these kinds of challenges.
 
Our survey research from the summer of 2005 revealed a high level of respect
for your publication among literacy field workers, esp. program managers.
Congratulations!

I'm glad you asked about the illustrations, Barb, because I really liked
them.  The Lab School drawing on the cover of 8A is quite clever!  I like,
too, how Mary included some of the actual vocabulary that was discussed in
the articles in the drawings.    

I think that the artwork is a real nice touch.  It makes FOB seem more
accessible, more inviting.

This summer I will be leading a workshop for 
experienced adult educators.  They have four 
hours of activities assigned before the workshop. 
As part of the reading assignment, they can 
select one of four articles:
To find the articles, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=167 and select 
either

What Silent Reading Tests alone Can't Tell you
or
There's Reading?..And Then There's Reading

These articles are about reading in general.  If 
you want to read more specifically on first level 
readers, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=147 and select 
either

Techniques for Teaching Beginning-Level Reading to Adults
			or
Reading for Pleasure

BTW, there is no reason you can't read all four 
or even the entire issue if you get involved.

As you read the article, code the test in the following manner:

=   I agree
X  I thought differently
+   New information
!    WOW
?   I don't get it
*   I know this is important

[INSERT system "Interactive Notational System for 
Effective Reading and Thinking" from Vaughn & 
Estes, 1986]


After completing the reading, please complete a 
short reflection piece.  In one or two 
paragraphs, describe the main ideas of the 
article your read and your reaction to  them.
In one or two paragraphs, describe your experience using the INSERT system.

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover "Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from each other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as it presents the latest research and relates that research right to the instructional setting.

Sarah, 
Thanks for your thorough explanation of one way to use articles from "Focus on Basics." (And thanks for bringing the
insert system to my attention: it's new to me and quite intriguing.)

Has anyone else used those articles for professional development? How did you use them? Do you have any suggestions for Sarah?

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how professional development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing beyond 8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching professional development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Dear Barb:

The usefulness of FOB is, in my opinion, the result of the variety of the
articles and topics offered.  Just as there isn't a single recipe for
success in the classroom, what one benefits from in order to grow depends on
the different perspectives brought to the profession.  And I think that
you've done a good job of balancing the dynamic between research and
practice.  It's hard to document the transition from one realm to another,
but I think FOB strikes a balanced review to offer to academics and
classroom professionals alike.

I must confess that I don't have a lot of time to read these days, but I do
enjoy being able to access electronic copies.  It is definitely a website I
will continue to bookmark!

Thanks, Varshna.

I am the professional development coordinator for adult educators in Colorado. I enjoyed taking part in the recent FOB evaluation survey.

I read FOB for my own PD and always include FOB articles in PD events - study circles, conference workshops, and extended trainings. I reference the NCSALL website in general, provide direct links to specific articles, and include printed copies of articles in handouts.  I also facilitate several work groups - a state-wide PD advisory group, our state's CAELA capacity-building team, and various pilot projects.  Whenever our state office receives a box of hard-copy FOBs I always snatch a dozen or more to give to members of these work groups to show my appreciation for the work they do.  I think everyone appreciates having their own, personal, hard-bound, nicely illustrated copy. 

Colorado's coordinator of our State Literacy Resource Centers always puts out an announcement on our state-wide adult ed listserv whenever a new issue of FOB comes out.  That spreads the word to adult ed program directors and teachers.

When I was in the classroom, our program director always circulated our one copy of FOB to all the teachers using a routing slip.

Hopefully FOB can continue to do its excellent work.  I would hate to have to choose among teachers, professional developers or program directors to be the focus of FOB's marketing efforts.  Based on what others and I have said, program directors and professional developers have the means to introduce FOB to teachers by incorporating FOB into the greater context of PD events.

I too love the printed version, with the nice thick paper. I keep mine in two binders so I can always find them. But we never had overwhelming success with subscriptions. We priced them low: $8 for 4 issues, which barely covered printing and mailing, thinking that individuals---teachers, we hoped---would want their own copies rather than have to share them. But we never seem to have more than 500 individual subscribers.

I also keep my copies - even if a topic is not immediately relevant to my program or my practice, it becomes relevant over time.

>From its inception, Focus on Basics/NCSALL has worked in partnership with the states to distribute the publication. We send a pre-established number (based on federal allocation and what the states tell us they can absorb) to almost every state and the state distributes them as it sees fit (in total, 8,500 copies go to states and protectorates). Some states prefer to send their constituents to the web rather than pay for mailing. Some states mail their allocations out, some give them out at events, etc.

We sell subscriptions and also bulk subscriptions. Some community colleges, for example, buy a bulk number and distribute them to staff.
(We had hoped the subscription base would grow but it has remained pretty stable.)

We also provide "photocopiable masters" to those who want them and promise to distribute copies. THese aren't really needed now that we put the PDF up on the web.

The programs I've worked for have always provided copies for faculty and staff, so I never had a need to subscribe personally.  Do adult ed programs subscribe or are they just provided by FOB?  I also keep my copies - even if a topic is not immediately relevant to my program or my practice, it becomes relevant over time.

I too love the printed version, with the nice thick paper. I keep mine in two binders so I can always find them. But we never had overwhelming success with subscriptions. We priced them low: $8 for 4 issues, which barely covered printing and mailing, thinking that individuals---teachers, we hoped---would want their own copies rather than have to share them. But we never seem to have more than 500 individual subscribers.

List readers, what's your story? Why did or didn't you subscribe?

Subject: RE: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

I am the professional development coordinator for adult educators in Colorado. I enjoyed taking part in the recent FOB evaluation survey.

I read FOB for my own PD and always include FOB articles in PD events - study circles, conference workshops, and extended trainings. I reference the NCSALL website in general, provide direct links to specific articles, and include printed copies of articles in handouts.  I also facilitate several work groups - a state-wide PD advisory group, our state's CAELA capacity-building team, and various pilot projects.  Whenever our state office receives a box of hard-copy FOBs I always snatch a dozen or more to give to members of these work groups to show my appreciation for the work they do.  I think everyone appreciates having their own, personal, hard-bound, nicely illustrated copy.

Colorado's coordinator of our State Literacy Resource Centers always puts out an announcement on our state-wide adult ed listserv whenever a new issue of FOB comes out.  That spreads the word to adult ed program directors and teachers.

When I was in the classroom, our program director always circulated our one copy of FOB to all the teachers using a routing slip.

Hopefully FOB can continue to do its excellent work.  I would hate to have to choose among teachers, professional developers or program directors to be the focus of FOB's marketing efforts.  Based on what others and I have said, program directors and professional developers have the means to introduce FOB to teachers by incorporating FOB into the greater context of PD events.

Subject: Re: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how professional development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing beyond 8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching professional development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover "Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from each other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as it presents the latest research and relates that research right to the instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I publicize each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information presented in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I always hear, "Something I can use tomorrow."  Well, FOB has always provided just that.

>Below are some questions to think about as we prepare for this
>discussion.
>
>1. How do you use FOB in your professional life?

I use it as a point of reference for developing professional development 
projects at work. I also use it as an invaluable source of information. I 
like to see what is working in other places and adapt ideas to fit my work 
environment.  I share information with my colleagues both from the FOB 
issues and from the discussion list.


>2. Have you ever used FOB for professional development? How?

Yes, I have. I use it most often in this manner as reference/research tool.


>3. Did the findings of this report change or add to your concept of FOB,
>or your thoughts on how your program can use it?

It's given me some insight into some other ways we may can use it but the 
findings didn't really change my opinion or thoughts about FOB. I still 
think it's an invaluable resource of information for Adult Education 
professionals.


>4. Were any of the findings surprising to you in any way?
>
>5. Reportedly, 72% of respondents interact with colleagues about what
>they read in FOB. In what ways do you do this, and how does it affect
>your work?

I share what I read when it fits a conversation. I'll find myself referring 
to something I've read in FOB or telling someone that I saw something 
related to what they're interested in a FOB issue. As to my work, it makes 
me more conscious of the many ways information and ideas can be shared. It 
reminds me that I'm not alone and that people have faced the same 
challenges and hurdles that I face, have faced or will face. It also gives 
me strategies for dealing with the day to day classroom hurdles without 
losing my sanity.

>6. The report indicates that FOB "helps to create professionals; it
>provides practitioners with the sense that they are not working in
>isolation." How important is this to you and others in your program?

I'm not sure how important it is to others but to me, it's very important. 
Up until recently my department has consisted of a lot of individuals with 
their own individual tasks/ classroom environments...and there has been 
little discussion between the "parts" of the whole. FOB keeps me connected 
to the greater picture of Adult Ed and really does cut down on the feeling 
of isolation that surrounds the job. I think now that there have been some 
administrative changes that perhaps FOB can be a bridge to building 
teamwork both within the dept and within the classrooms.


>7. According to written comments from the survey, readers want more
>online discussions, workshops and study circles to reflect and share
>what they read in FOB. How can this discussion list
>help to meet this need better?
>

I think if the lists becomes an avenue for commenting, sharing ideas etc 
about related material in FOB, that it would be one way to meet the need.

the articles in the drawings.

I like this publication very much.  I read all the issues and find them
useful and informative.  The last article I used actively was Robin
Schwarz' article on the struggling ESL learner.  We asked our new
teachers to read it prior to their New Teacher Training.  It was a great
article that generated a lot of discussion and hopefully raised the
level of awareness of these potential learner problems.  Keep up the
good work.

Thanks, Missy,,,
That struggling ESOL learner article really struck a chord. 

When you've been working in a field---any field---for awhile, it's easy to
forget how much you actually have learned and apply on a day-to-day basis.
Robin's article seems to have reminded us that new staff, or experienced
staff working with new types of learners, need information that may have
become second nature to some.

What other articles to folks use with new teachers, and why?

Hi Barb:
 
I like the illustrations, too. I particularly liked the one from September
2003 that showed authentic materials like invoices and soup cans flying in
the window. Or were they flying out the window??
 
I also liked the way you used portions of the cover illustration inside the
publication to send visual cues that the inside article was related to the
cover story.
 
You're right: it's always a creative challenge to illustrate an abstract
concept in a concrete manner. The recently released NAAL is a good example.
We're blessed to have a talented and creative graphic artist on our staff
who helps us with these kinds of challenges.
 
Our survey research from the summer of 2005 revealed a high level of respect
for your publication among literacy field workers, esp. program managers.
Congratulations!

This summer I will be leading a workshop for 
experienced adult educators.  They have four 
hours of activities assigned before the workshop. 
As part of the reading assignment, they can 
select one of four articles:
To find the articles, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=167 and select 
either

What Silent Reading Tests alone Can't Tell you
or
There's Reading?..And Then There's Reading

These articles are about reading in general.  If 
you want to read more specifically on first level 
readers, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=147 and select 
either

Techniques for Teaching Beginning-Level Reading to Adults
			or
Reading for Pleasure

BTW, there is no reason you can't read all four 
or even the entire issue if you get involved.

As you read the article, code the test in the following manner:

=   I agree
X  I thought differently
+   New information
!    WOW
?   I don't get it
*   I know this is important

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the
instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I publicize
each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information presented
in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I always
hear, "Something I can use tomorrow."  Well, FOB has always provided just
that.

Sarah, 
Thanks for your thorough explanation of one way to use articles from "Focus
on Basics." (And thanks for bringing the
insert system to my attention: it's new to me and quite intriguing.)

Has anyone else used those articles for professional development? How did
you use them? Do you have any suggestions for Sarah?

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how professional
development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the
publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear
this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing beyond
8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching professional
development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or
should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Dear Barb:

The usefulness of FOB is, in my opinion, the result of the variety of the
articles and topics offered.  Just as there isn't a single recipe for
success in the classroom, what one benefits from in order to grow depends on
the different perspectives brought to the profession.  And I think that
you've done a good job of balancing the dynamic between research and
practice.  It's hard to document the transition from one realm to another,
but I think FOB strikes a balanced review to offer to academics and
classroom professionals alike.

I must confess that I don't have a lot of time to read these days, but I do
enjoy being able to access electronic copies.  It is definitely a website I
will continue to bookmark!

Thanks, Varshna.

Since FOB is funded by the US Gov (Institute of Education Sciences), I should first fill the FOB 8C board with US practitioners. If there are open slots and no other US volunteers, I see no reason not to have Canadians as well.
 
Given that much of the work will be done in the summer, when people's schedules are crazy, we'll have a more board members than usual. That way we'll always have a critical mass available. 

I'll announce the board the week of April 24, so if you haven't contacted me yet, there's still time.

I'm glad you asked about the illustrations, Barb, because I really liked
them.  The Lab School drawing on the cover of 8A is quite clever!  I like,
too, how Mary included some of the actual vocabulary that was discussed in
the articles in the drawings.

I think that the artwork is a real nice touch.  It makes FOB seem more
accessible, more inviting.

I like this publication very much.  I read all the issues and find them
useful and informative.  The last article I used actively was Robin
Schwarz' article on the struggling ESL learner.  We asked our new
teachers to read it prior to their New Teacher Training.  It was a great
article that generated a lot of discussion and hopefully raised the
level of awareness of these potential learner problems.  Keep up the
good work.

Thanks, Missy,,,
That struggling ESOL learner article really struck a chord. 

When you've been working in a field---any field---for awhile, it's easy to
forget how much you actually have learned and apply on a day-to-day basis.
Robin's article seems to have reminded us that new staff, or experienced
staff working with new types of learners, need information that may have
become second nature to some.

What other articles to folks use with new teachers, and why?

Hi Barb:
 
I like the illustrations, too. I particularly liked the one from September
2003 that showed authentic materials like invoices and soup cans flying in
the window. Or were they flying out the window??
 
I also liked the way you used portions of the cover illustration inside the
publication to send visual cues that the inside article was related to the
cover story.
 
You're right: it's always a creative challenge to illustrate an abstract
concept in a concrete manner. The recently released NAAL is a good example.
We're blessed to have a talented and creative graphic artist on our staff
who helps us with these kinds of challenges.
 
Our survey research from the summer of 2005 revealed a high level of respect
for your publication among literacy field workers, esp. program managers.
Congratulations!

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the
instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I publicize
each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information presented
in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I always

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how professional
development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the
publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear
this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing beyond
8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching professional
development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or
should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the
instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I publicize
each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information presented
in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I always
hear, "Something I can use tomorrow."  Well, FOB has always provided just
that.

Dear Barb:

The usefulness of FOB is, in my opinion, the result of the variety of the
articles and topics offered.  Just as there isn't a single recipe for
success in the classroom, what one benefits from in order to grow depends on
the different perspectives brought to the profession.  And I think that
you've done a good job of balancing the dynamic between research and
practice.  It's hard to document the transition from one realm to another,
but I think FOB strikes a balanced review to offer to academics and
classroom professionals alike.

I must confess that I don't have a lot of time to read these days, but I do
enjoy being able to access electronic copies.  It is definitely a website I
will continue to bookmark!

Thanks, Varshna.

Since FOB is funded by the US Gov (Institute of Education Sciences), I
should first fill the FOB 8C board with US practitioners. If there are
open slots and no other US volunteers, I see no reason not to have
Canadians as well.
 
Given that much of the work will be done in the summer, when people's
schedules are crazy, we'll have a more board members than usual. That
way we'll always have a critical mass available. 

I'll announce the board the week of April 24, so if you haven't

I'm glad you asked about the illustrations, Barb, because I really liked
them.  The Lab School drawing on the cover of 8A is quite clever!  I
like,
too, how Mary included some of the actual vocabulary that was discussed
in
the articles in the drawings.

I think that the artwork is a real nice touch.  It makes FOB seem more

I like this publication very much.  I read all the issues and find them
useful and informative.  The last article I used actively was Robin
Schwarz' article on the struggling ESL learner.  We asked our new
teachers to read it prior to their New Teacher Training.  It was a great
article that generated a lot of discussion and hopefully raised the
level of awareness of these potential learner problems.  Keep up the
good work.

Thanks, Missy,,,
That struggling ESOL learner article really struck a chord. 

When you've been working in a field---any field---for awhile, it's easy
to
forget how much you actually have learned and apply on a day-to-day
basis.
Robin's article seems to have reminded us that new staff, or experienced
staff working with new types of learners, need information that may have
become second nature to some.

What other articles to folks use with new teachers, and why?

Hi Barb:
 
I like the illustrations, too. I particularly liked the one from
September
2003 that showed authentic materials like invoices and soup cans flying
in
the window. Or were they flying out the window??
 
I also liked the way you used portions of the cover illustration inside
the
publication to send visual cues that the inside article was related to
the
cover story.
 
You're right: it's always a creative challenge to illustrate an abstract
concept in a concrete manner. The recently released NAAL is a good
example.
We're blessed to have a talented and creative graphic artist on our
staff
who helps us with these kinds of challenges.
 
Our survey research from the summer of 2005 revealed a high level of
respect
for your publication among literacy field workers, esp. program
managers.
Congratulations!

hours of activities assigned before the workshop. 
As part of the reading assignment, they can 
select one of four articles:
To find the articles, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=167 and select 
either

What Silent Reading Tests alone Can't Tell you
or
There's Reading?..And Then There's Reading

These articles are about reading in general.  If 
you want to read more specifically on first level 
readers, go to 
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=147 and select 
either

Techniques for Teaching Beginning-Level Reading to Adults
			or
Reading for Pleasure

BTW, there is no reason you can't read all four 
or even the entire issue if you get involved.

As you read the article, code the test in the following manner:

=   I agree
X  I thought differently
+   New information
!    WOW
?   I don't get it
*   I know this is important

[INSERT system "Interactive Notational System for

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from
each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as
it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the

"Focus
on Basics." (And thanks for bringing the

Has anyone else used those articles for professional development? How

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how
professional
development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the
publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear
this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing
beyond
8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching
professional
development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or
should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from
each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as
it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the
instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I
publicize
each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information
presented
in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I
always
hear, "Something I can use tomorrow."  Well, FOB has always provided
just
that.

Dear Barb:

The usefulness of FOB is, in my opinion, the result of the variety of
the
articles and topics offered.  Just as there isn't a single recipe for
success in the classroom, what one benefits from in order to grow
depends on
the different perspectives brought to the profession.  And I think that
you've done a good job of balancing the dynamic between research and
practice.  It's hard to document the transition from one realm to
another,
but I think FOB strikes a balanced review to offer to academics and
classroom professionals alike.

I must confess that I don't have a lot of time to read these days, but I
do
enjoy being able to access electronic copies.  It is definitely a
website I
will continue to bookmark!

Thanks, Varshna.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 227]  Searching for topics on FOB
Message-ID: <s43e228c.010@mail.jsi.com>

I agree that the variety and relevance of the topics covered are one of
the strengths of FOB. Almost every article I read gives insight into
some specific aspect of working and learning in a classroom that
teachers face daily, and the "Implications for Teaching" sections at the
end of the articles tie that insight into action. 

KC Andrew mentioned keeping copies for later because the topic "becomes
relevant over time." This reminded me that there is a wealth of past
topics that may become relevant and are worth going back to find. When I
recently did a presentation on Health Literacy, I found the issue that
addressed Health Literacy, used the information from it, and distributed
it. (I always feel like Santa when I distribute copies--they are so
prized!)

I am lucky enough to work at the dissemination center for FOB, so I can
easily find the back issues with topics I need, so I am not very
familiar with searching for back issues and topics on the NCSALL
website. Barb, can you please give us a run-down on how to search for
past FOB topics?

Thanks,

Julie

The funding for NCSALL ends at the end of the year. After that, the US DOE won't be funding a research center that focuses on adult basic education.
We have been trying to raise funds to keep "Focus on Basics" going, but have not secured anything yet. We're still trying, but can not say with any assurance that we will be able to publish past 8C.

Since FOB is funded by the US Gov (Institute of Education Sciences), I
should first fill the FOB 8C board with US practitioners. If there are
open slots and no other US volunteers, I see no reason not to have
Canadians as well.
 
Given that much of the work will be done in the summer, when people's
schedules are crazy, we'll have a more board members than usual. That
way we'll always have a critical mass available. 

I'll announce the board the week of April 24, so if you haven't

I'm glad you asked about the illustrations, Barb, because I really liked
them.  The Lab School drawing on the cover of 8A is quite clever!  I
like,
too, how Mary included some of the actual vocabulary that was discussed

I think that the artwork is a real nice touch.  It makes FOB seem more

I like this publication very much.  I read all the issues and find them
useful and informative.  The last article I used actively was Robin
Schwarz' article on the struggling ESL learner.  We asked our new
teachers to read it prior to their New Teacher Training.  It was a great
article that generated a lot of discussion and hopefully raised the
level of awareness of these potential learner problems.  Keep up the
good work.

Thanks, Missy,,,
That struggling ESOL learner article really struck a chord. 

When you've been working in a field---any field---for awhile, it's easy
to
forget how much you actually have learned and apply on a day-to-day
basis.
Robin's article seems to have reminded us that new staff, or experienced
staff working with new types of learners, need information that may have
become second nature to some.

What other articles to folks use with new teachers, and why?

Hi Barb:
 
I like the illustrations, too. I particularly liked the one from
September
2003 that showed authentic materials like invoices and soup cans flying
in
the window. Or were they flying out the window??
 
I also liked the way you used portions of the cover illustration inside
the
publication to send visual cues that the inside article was related to
the
cover story.
 
You're right: it's always a creative challenge to illustrate an abstract
concept in a concrete manner. The recently released NAAL is a good
example.
We're blessed to have a talented and creative graphic artist on our
staff
who helps us with these kinds of challenges.
 
Our survey research from the summer of 2005 revealed a high level of
respect
for your publication among literacy field workers, esp. program
managers.
Congratulations!

One of the themes that is emerging in this discussion is how
professional
development providers serve as a conduit, introducing teachers to the
publication and to particular articles.

If you're a teacher, how did you find out about "Focus on Basics"?
If you're a professional development provider, does your experience bear
this out: do you introduce teacher to FOB?

And if we are able to find additional funding and continue publishing
beyond
8C, where should we put our dissemination energy? Into reaching
professional
development providers, assuming they will introduce teachers to FOB? Or
should we focus marketing efforts on teachers? Thoughts?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 215]  FOB Evaluation

FOB has always intrigued me because it's on top of the challenges that
teachers and tutors face in classrooms across the country.  Once we were
discussing the reasons that students go on or do not go on to other
educational pursuits.  Soon I saw that the next issue of FOB would cover
"Transitions."  This field is widely diverse and often isolated from
each
other and from a sense of itself as a field.  FOB is a unifying force as
it
presents the latest research and relates that research right to the
instructional setting. In my job as a state level coordinator, I
publicize
each and every issue so that practitioners can use the information
presented
in the articles.  When I survey practitioners about what they need, I
always
hear, "Something I can use tomorrow."  Well, FOB has always provided
just
that.

Dear Barb:

The usefulness of FOB is, in my opinion, the result of the variety of
the
articles and topics offered.  Just as there isn't a single recipe for
success in the classroom, what one benefits from in order to grow
depends on
the different perspectives brought to the profession.  And I think that
you've done a good job of balancing the dynamic between research and
practice.  It's hard to document the transition from one realm to
another,
but I think FOB strikes a balanced review to offer to academics and
classroom professionals alike.

I must confess that I don't have a lot of time to read these days, but I
do
enjoy being able to access electronic copies.  It is definitely a
website I
will continue to bookmark!

Thanks, Varshna.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 229]  teacher education and change
Message-ID: <445B747D@webmail.utk.edu>

Hi Barb,
As you know, in the FOB evaluation NCSALL reported finding that "Respondents 
with higher levels of education report a higher rate of change in their 
attitudes and behaviors about adult basic education and a higher rate of 
putting into action ideas they learn as a result of reading Focus on Basics."

The report also notes the contradiction of this to the finding in the 2003 
NCSALL Professional Development Study which documents that 'teachers with 
master's degrees were less likely than those without to act upon information 
learned in staff development activities.' One hypothesis offered was that 
teachers who were more educated were possibly more "settled" in their work and 
less likely to demonstrate change based on what they learned in PD.

What are your speculations about this discrepancy as it pertains to the 
research, and what is the message you'd recommend that professional developers 
take away from this comparison as it is pertinent to their work?

Thanks, Jackie

The easiest way to find articles from earlier FOBs on topics you're interested in now is to go to the NCSALL web site (http://www.ncsall.net). On the righthand side is "subject link", right under the GOOGLE search thing. Click on subject link.

Scroll down that list to find the topic that best describes your interest. Click on that, and it will bring you to a list of all the related NCSALL products. Scroll down to see Focus on Basics articles are grouped under the heading "Focus on Basics".

If your topic doesn't appear on the subject topic list, you can try using the GOOGLE search bar.

Or, you can post your question to the FOB list serve, and in my role as human search engine, I will send you to the most relevant articles.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 227]  Searching for topics on FOB

I agree that the variety and relevance of the topics covered are one of
the strengths of FOB. Almost every article I read gives insight into
some specific aspect of working and learning in a classroom that
teachers face daily, and the "Implications for Teaching" sections at the
end of the articles tie that insight into action. 

KC Andrew mentioned keeping copies for later because the topic "becomes
relevant over time." This reminded me that there is a wealth of past
topics that may become relevant and are worth going back to find. When I
recently did a presentation on Health Literacy, I found the issue that
addressed Health Literacy, used the information from it, and distributed
it. (I always feel like Santa when I distribute copies--they are so
prized!)

I am lucky enough to work at the dissemination center for FOB, so I can
easily find the back issues with topics I need, so I am not very
familiar with searching for back issues and topics on the NCSALL
website. Barb, can you please give us a run-down on how to search for
past FOB topics?

Thanks,

That's a great question, and one that merits more research. I'll weigh in, but would love to hear from others, too.

Keep in mind, the FOB evaluation was not an effort to replicate the findings of NCSALL Staff Development Study. The NCSALL Staff Development study involved practitioners in a variety of different types of professional development. But those types did not include "reading professional journals and perhaps discussing them with colleagues". So what we might be seeing is that different types of practitioners relate differently to difference types of professional development. 

In terms of what lesson it offers professional developers now: to me it says that if you don't already include reading materials with any professional development activity you conduct, you should consider adding some.

I find that one of the differences between program administrators and adult
education teachers is that administrators look at the research and, when
they come across a good theory or implication for instruction, they pass it
along to their teachers. Unfortunately, teachers, on the other hand, are
often part time, many with other full time jobs. They do not have enough
time to stay up to date on all the research in the field, so FOB in my
estimation probably serves more administrators than teachers. 
What do I see that teachers want? They want material and lessons they can
use the next day in their classrooms as they do not have time to create such
materials. So, if FOB (and this is only my opinion) wants to reach both
teachers and administrators, I feel the articles exposing current research
in adult education should also have reproducible materials that can be
immediately used in the classroom that support this research. Perhaps in
this manner teachers will then be inspired to continue to create other
materials once they have had an opportunity to see how the particular piece
of research impacts learning in their classroom.

I am so sorry to hear that our profession might lose NCSALL.  For years, 
the ERIC Clearinghouse on Adult, Career, and Vocational Education and 
NCSALL publications have been the places where I start any search for 
information about adult education and adult learning.  ERIC has already 
been eliminated, and now we learn that NCSALL faces the same.  Barb, is 
it possible that the publications will be archived in a searchable form?

Like others, I frequently pass out copies of Focus on Basics at 
workshops and meetings.  FOB is the basis for workshops I deliver on a 
variety of topics.  Hoping to encourage people to explore the NCSALL 
site and learn something of the many resources there, I have built links 
to FOB articles into an online course for local program directors.  Just 
last week, while directing people to the site during a workshop on 
grant-writing, I heard one of the participants say that he remembered 
the site because of the online course.  Hurray!

Being a fan of the publication, I was pleased when I was able to serve 
on the editorial board last year.  Being able to work with distant 
colleagues as we read and learned from submitted articles was 
professional development itself, and it was a pleasure to work with 
Barb.  I can't imagine professional development in our field in a future 
without Focus on Basics.

I second Connie's comment that it was a pleasure to work with Barb. I found
working on the editorial board to be a great learning experience in and of
itself. It was amazing to me how much time and effort went into the revision
of submitted articles until they were printed in final form. If any of you
are planning to publish someday, this gives you good insight into what takes
place after the article is submitted.

I'm an instructor in ABE/GED/Dev Ed and I read FOB most of the time to
keep current in the field.  It does seem that most of the writers are
administrators and I'm glad that they are reading what's going on in the
field.  Hopefully, it helps them to support their part-time staff in
creative ways and to move their programs into the future successfully.

I find that one of the differences between program administrators and
adult
education teachers is that administrators look at the research and, when
they come across a good theory or implication for instruction, they pass
it
along to their teachers. Unfortunately, teachers, on the other hand, are
often part time, many with other full time jobs. They do not have enough
time to stay up to date on all the research in the field, so FOB in my
estimation probably serves more administrators than teachers. 
What do I see that teachers want? They want material and lessons they
can
use the next day in their classrooms as they do not have time to create
such
materials. So, if FOB (and this is only my opinion) wants to reach both
teachers and administrators, I feel the articles exposing current
research
in adult education should also have reproducible materials that can be
immediately used in the classroom that support this research. Perhaps in
this manner teachers will then be inspired to continue to create other
materials once they have had an opportunity to see how the particular
piece
of research impacts learning in their classroom.

The easiest way to find articles from earlier FOBs on topics you're
interested in now is to go to the NCSALL web site
(http://www.ncsall.net). On the righthand side is "subject link", right
under the GOOGLE search thing. Click on subject link.

Scroll down that list to find the topic that best describes your
interest. Click on that, and it will bring you to a list of all the
related NCSALL products. Scroll down to see Focus on Basics articles are
grouped under the heading "Focus on Basics".

If your topic doesn't appear on the subject topic list, you can try
using the GOOGLE search bar.

Or, you can post your question to the FOB list serve, and in my role as
human search engine, I will send you to the most relevant articles.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 227]  Searching for topics on FOB

I agree that the variety and relevance of the topics covered are one of
the strengths of FOB. Almost every article I read gives insight into
some specific aspect of working and learning in a classroom that
teachers face daily, and the "Implications for Teaching" sections at the
end of the articles tie that insight into action. 

KC Andrew mentioned keeping copies for later because the topic "becomes
relevant over time." This reminded me that there is a wealth of past
topics that may become relevant and are worth going back to find. When I
recently did a presentation on Health Literacy, I found the issue that
addressed Health Literacy, used the information from it, and distributed
it. (I always feel like Santa when I distribute copies--they are so
prized!)

I am lucky enough to work at the dissemination center for FOB, so I can
easily find the back issues with topics I need, so I am not very
familiar with searching for back issues and topics on the NCSALL
website. Barb, can you please give us a run-down on how to search for
past FOB topics?

Thanks,

That's a good point, Kathy. Our first evaluation indicated that teachers wanted more "ready to use" information and materials. We responded to a certain degree by creating the occasional column "Focus on Teaching", by incorporating more boxes with teaching ideas into articles, and by encouraging authors to include sections on implications for teachers. At the same time, our focus is connecting research and practice, so we don't want to become a "lesson plan for tomorrow" resource. It's a careful balance, although you're right, we could certainly work more on connecting the research to the classroom.

Dear Barb,

REF (presumed) professional development and the
incorporation thereof issue ... and I speak for
colleagues here -- 

"Incorporation thereof" is different for new and
seasoned practioners, education levels accounted for. 
I think there are several aspects to consider -the
major one of which is:  Does one choose their own PD
based on professional interests/an intererst
stream/prior education/prior professional development
activities, student needs etc., or is PD something
that is arranged by one's administration and is
supposedly suitable for all simply because it (the PD
offering) fits somehwere within the world of adult
education? That's the situation I'm in, and I'm sure
not alone.

What is bona fide professional development, i.e.
current and content relevant, for a new teacher may
very well not be for a seasoned one - either because
it's old hat, it doesn't fit their teaching style, or
is not suitable for their students, or ..... So, who
incorporates what and why, or why not, has to be
carefully considered.  

The above are just applied meanderings. 

Have a good weekend.

Dear Listers...
Terry makes a good point...presumably most folks who completed the Focus on Basics evaluation survey read FOB because they are self motivated to do so (although we didn't ask that question). Whereas some participants in professional development are sent by their administrators because of the presumed suitability of the offering. Motivation makes a difference. 

I'm not sure how the NCSALL Staff Development study treated motivation in their analysis. I'll ask them to share with us their views, if not this week then next.

What do other readers think might be reasons for the difference in findings between the FOB evaluation, in which "Respondents 
with higher levels of education report a higher rate of change in their attitudes and behaviors about adult basic education
and a higher rate of putting into action ideas they learn as a result of reading Focus on Basics" and the NCSALL staff development study, which reported that 'teachers with master's degrees were less likely than those without to act upon information 
 learned in staff development activities.'?

The easiest way to find articles from earlier FOBs on topics you're
interested in now is to go to the NCSALL web site
(http://www.ncsall.net). On the righthand side is "subject link", right
under the GOOGLE search thing. Click on subject link.

Scroll down that list to find the topic that best describes your
interest. Click on that, and it will bring you to a list of all the
related NCSALL products. Scroll down to see Focus on Basics articles are
grouped under the heading "Focus on Basics".

If your topic doesn't appear on the subject topic list, you can try
using the GOOGLE search bar.

Or, you can post your question to the FOB list serve, and in my role as
human search engine, I will send you to the most relevant articles.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 227]  Searching for topics on FOB

I agree that the variety and relevance of the topics covered are one of
the strengths of FOB. Almost every article I read gives insight into
some specific aspect of working and learning in a classroom that
teachers face daily, and the "Implications for Teaching" sections at the
end of the articles tie that insight into action. 

KC Andrew mentioned keeping copies for later because the topic "becomes
relevant over time." This reminded me that there is a wealth of past
topics that may become relevant and are worth going back to find. When I
recently did a presentation on Health Literacy, I found the issue that
addressed Health Literacy, used the information from it, and distributed
it. (I always feel like Santa when I distribute copies--they are so
prized!)

I am lucky enough to work at the dissemination center for FOB, so I can
easily find the back issues with topics I need, so I am not very
familiar with searching for back issues and topics on the NCSALL
website. Barb, can you please give us a run-down on how to search for
past FOB topics?

Thanks,

As an instructor I read FOB because I like to see what other programs are doing  that works. I can take what they're doing back to my administrators and say "Hey, we might want to see if we can do something similar." or I can use it to back up a need or supprt a stance at times.   Additionally, not all the articles are from the admin point of view. There are plenty of success stories by teachers as well...those are great to share with colleagues and students alike. They often motivate and inspitre others when they feel they've reached the end of their rope.

I'm an instructor in ABE/GED/Dev Ed and I read FOB most of the time to
keep current in the field.  It does seem that most of the writers are
administrators and I'm glad that they are reading what's going on in the
field.  Hopefully, it helps them to support their part-time staff in
creative ways and to move their programs into the future successfully.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 232] Who uses FOB?

I find that one of the differences between program administrators and
adult
education teachers is that administrators look at the research and, when
they come across a good theory or implication for instruction, they pass
it
along to their teachers. Unfortunately, teachers, on the other hand, are
often part time, many with other full time jobs. They do not have enough
time to stay up to date on all the research in the field, so FOB in my
estimation probably serves more administrators than teachers. 
What do I see that teachers want? They want material and lessons they
can
use the next day in their classrooms as they do not have time to create
such
materials. So, if FOB (and this is only my opinion) wants to reach both
teachers and administrators, I feel the articles exposing current
research
in adult education should also have reproducible materials that can be
immediately used in the classroom that support this research. Perhaps in
this manner teachers will then be inspired to continue to create other
materials once they have had an opportunity to see how the particular
piece
of research impacts learning in their classroom.

I think motivation is probably the driving force. I think the individual has to be willing to learn or be open to new ideas. I also think complacency is a bad thing and something people slide into sometimes unknowingly...they get comfortable with the way they've done something and think they don't have to change it or even fear the change and tensions usually associated with change.

Personally,  I've waited for a while before pursuing an advanced degree and if all goes well I'll be starting my Masters in the fall. I've been teaching in Adult Ed for 10 years though. I think sometimes, that there is a feeling that having an advanced degree means you've "arrived" at some pre determined destination...or that you're now an expert able to impart knowledge but perhaps not gain it. I'm not really sure. I've encounted that behavior in the workplace and I think that's what's put me off for so long about going back to school. I don't ever want to feel I have nothing else to learn or gain via any form of education. I definitely feel that professional development is essential to staying effective in the classroom. I actually believe professional development is essential in ANY workplace.

I think I'd wonder how the NCSALL arrived at their conclusion compared to how FOB arrived at theirs.  Was the pool of respondants the same in size as well as was the pool of respondants the same in terms of degrees etc. 

Ultimately, I think it comes down to the individual person's drive and desire to grow professionally and personally.

Dear Listers...
Terry makes a good point...presumably most folks who completed the Focus on Basics evaluation survey read FOB because they are self motivated to do so (although we didn't ask that question). Whereas some participants in professional development are sent by their administrators because of the presumed suitability of the offering. Motivation makes a difference. 

I'm not sure how the NCSALL Staff Development study treated motivation in their analysis. I'll ask them to share with us their views, if not this week then next.

What do other readers think might be reasons for the difference in findings between the FOB evaluation, in which "Respondents 
with higher levels of education report a higher rate of change in their attitudes and behaviors about adult basic education
and a higher rate of putting into action ideas they learn as a result of reading Focus on Basics" and the NCSALL staff development study, which reported that 'teachers with master's degrees were less likely than those without to act upon information 
 learned in staff development activities.'?

Dear Barb,

REF (presumed) professional development and the
incorporation thereof issue ... and I speak for
colleagues here -- 

"Incorporation thereof" is different for new and
seasoned practioners, education levels accounted for. 
I think there are several aspects to consider -the
major one of which is:  Does one choose their own PD
based on professional interests/an intererst
stream/prior education/prior professional development
activities, student needs etc., or is PD something
that is arranged by one's administration and is
supposedly suitable for all simply because it (the PD
offering) fits somehwere within the world of adult
education? That's the situation I'm in, and I'm sure
not alone.

What is bona fide professional development, i.e.
current and content relevant, for a new teacher may
very well not be for a seasoned one - either because
it's old hat, it doesn't fit their teaching style, or
is not suitable for their students, or ..... So, who
incorporates what and why, or why not, has to be
carefully considered.  

The above are just applied meanderings. 

Have a good weekend.

Katrina and all

I think motivation is likely an important factor, but we also need to be
mindful of systemic support for educators.  What supports are/aren't
available to people who are working more than one part-time job?  What are
the cultures of professional development in their various workplaces?  Aside
from the intrinsic motivation to learn more, what messages to program
administrators, colleagues and funders convey to teachers about the value of
professional development?

I was really fortunate to have had an opportunity to begin my MA work after
I'd been teaching for 9 years (through a program that funded the courses so
that we only paid for books).  It was a part-time masters program, over two
and a half years, designed for full-time teachers.  I was already privileged
to be working full time; the degree program required a lot of work, but not
a lot of money.  While grateful endlessly for the program - I was ready to
dig in and learn, and had the questions to ask that I might not have had in
my first year of teaching - I still think that we can't only ascribe
participation in PD to personal motivation.  We also need to be proactive in
working to build opportunities for practitioners across the board - new,
continuing, veteran practitioners - or we risk what I've heard Barb describe
as "good programs getting gooder."  It's great to build capacity in strong
programs - but it's also great to make capacity building available across
the board.

IF it is the case that personal motivation is the determining factor, then
we've all the more work to do to build a greater collective culture of
learning and respect for learning throughout the field.

Janet and all

I have to agree strong with Janet's thoughts on motivation.  I train adult ESL
teachers in MA TESOL program and many of them (of varying levels of experience)
WANT to implement the ideas they read in FOB ... but when they get go back to
their programs, they reported feeling frustrated that their programs don't seem
to support innovation and creativity in teaching. If a program isn't committed
at the program-level to fostering a "culture of change" (lots of stuff out there
in K-12 about this), personal motivation can provide a point of entry but is not
sufficient for meaningful impact.

At the same time I think we need to recognize the many ways that teachers do
grow and develop that don't necessarily translate into measurable learner gains.
Stephen Reder and his team in Portland have argued for a broader view on learner
participation, beyond program attendance.  Perhaps we also need to begin
systematically accounting for the ways that teachers manage their own
professional growth and strive to develop professionally, outside of formal pd
organizations and *in spite* of the lack of programmatic support.  

With FOB online, the series represents a rich library that a teacher could turn
to for self-reflection. However there are still a lot of teachers out there (I
meet them at TESOL conventions) who don't know about NCSALL or FOB.  If FOB is
facing the end of its publishing run, it seems strategic to think how NCSALL
might use its remaining FOB funds to expand its outreach.

Wow, lots of ideas and information here.

First, regarding the differing findings of the two studies (the FOB survey, and the NCSALL Staff Development Study, a lengthy research projects)in one, those with less education were more likely to incorporate ideas learned in professional development. In the other, those with more education were likely to do the incorporating...
But perhaps the good news is that both groups, under certain conditions, put professional development to use.

The issue that Janet writes about, of the conditions conducive to engagement in professional development, are much the same issues we think about when pondering how to enroll and engage ABE learners. The need, the motivation, are important, but so are elements such as availability, cost (free), accessibility, child care if needed, etc. And a climate conducive to learning. I can't agree more that all the pieces have to be in place. 

Has anyone experienced a considerable change in their program, toward a climate more conducive to learning? And when I write "climate" I'm thinking about both atmosphere and also particulars: paid release time, substitutes available, support for trying new things, etc. What caused the change? What can we learn from your experiences? How about change, I hate to say it, in the opposite direction? What stifles professional learning?

And continuing outreach, particularly to folks who don't know of FOB and NCSALL as a resource, is a valuable reminder. Any suggestions of concrete things NCSALL should be doing to bring itself and FOB to teachers' attention?

in K-12 about this), personal motivation can provide a point of entry but is not
sufficient for meaningful impact.

At the same time I think we need to recognize the many ways that teachers do
grow and develop that don't necessarily translate into measurable learner gains.
Stephen Reder and his team in Portland have argued for a broader view on learner
participation, beyond program attendance.  Perhaps we also need to begin
systematically accounting for the ways that teachers manage their own
professional growth and strive to develop professionally, outside of formal pd
organizations and *in spite* of the lack of programmatic support.  

With FOB online, the series represents a rich library that a teacher could turn
to for self-reflection. However there are still a lot of teachers out there (I
meet them at TESOL conventions) who don't know about NCSALL or FOB.  If FOB is
facing the end of its publishing run, it seems strategic to think how NCSALL
might use its remaining FOB funds to expand its outreach.

Thanks to everyone...please continue to send us ideas on how to get existing articles into the hands of teachers...

Our dissemination team sends copies of all NCSALL publications to ERIC (and now to whatever it is) to archive. So they should be available there as well.

I WON'T be able to access email from Sunday - through next Friday, but will be back on by April 22.
(And a new Focus on Basics will be out in May!)

I just checked ERIC and you can find them either under "Focus on Basics" (best to put a year in) or with a search word...
So that's good to know...posterity!

I think the biggest support that is missing is adequate funding. I recently attended an event in my state and was fortunate to be an instructor among several other administrators as well as other instructors. In our down time,  I had the chance to talk with the two administrators. They were talking about how they'd love to send their teachers to what we ourselves were attending. I asked why they didn't. They said they didn't have the funds and they didn't have the means by and large to provide professional development on any regular basis. I thought that was sad and I counted myself blessed that the school I work for does budget for professional development.  I was also disappoited that professional development isn't/wasn't considered  something that should be necessary in EVERY budget.  Unfortunately the way community college budgets are done sometimes means there is great disparity across the state and therefore great disparity in the opportunities available.

I agree that there is probably more that goes into the professional development question and the differences between the NCSALL findings and the FOB findings. I'm just not sure where we'd even begin to get people to appreciate and understand the great need there really is for providing professional development on a larger, consistent scale.

Katrina and all

I think motivation is likely an important factor, but we also need to be
mindful of systemic support for educators.  What supports are/aren't
available to people who are working more than one part-time job?  What are
the cultures of professional development in their various workplaces?  Aside
from the intrinsic motivation to learn more, what messages to program
administrators, colleagues and funders convey to teachers about the value of
professional development?

I was really fortunate to have had an opportunity to begin my MA work after
I'd been teaching for 9 years (through a program that funded the courses so
that we only paid for books).  It was a part-time masters program, over two
and a half years, designed for full-time teachers.  I was already privileged
to be working full time; the degree program required a lot of work, but not
a lot of money.  While grateful endlessly for the program - I was ready to
dig in and learn, and had the questions to ask that I might not have had in
my first year of teaching - I still think that we can't only ascribe
participation in PD to personal motivation.  We also need to be proactive in
working to build opportunities for practitioners across the board - new,
continuing, veteran practitioners - or we risk what I've heard Barb describe
as "good programs getting gooder."  It's great to build capacity in strong
programs - but it's also great to make capacity building available across
the board.

IF it is the case that personal motivation is the determining factor, then
we've all the more work to do to build a greater collective culture of
learning and respect for learning throughout the field.

Designing workshops that have dual purposes might be a good strategy for
effective staff development.  My example is WATER on THE WEB.  This
training worked for both my part time jobs.  It gave me worksites for my
watershed education needs and live sites that I used weekly with my GED
students.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 252]  Meeting of the Minds II Symposium
Message-ID: <s444b790.096@mail.jsi.com>

Hi All,

I am passing on this announcement from Mary Ann Corley about  a national
adult education practitioner-researcher symposium, a Meeting of the
Minds II, to be held in Sacramento, CA November 30-December 2, 2006. 

Julie

***********   

SAVE the DATES:  November 30-December 2, 2006!

ANNOUNCING: A MEETING OF THE MINDS II SYMPOSIUM!

The National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy
(NCSALL), the California Department of Education (CDE) Adult Education
Office, and the California Adult Literacy Professional Development
Project (CALPRO) of the American Institutes for Research are pleased to
announce a Meeting of the Minds II: A National Adult Education
Practitioner-Researcher Symposium. 

Scheduled for November 30-December 2, 2006, at the Sheraton Grand hotel
in Sacramento, California, the symposium is designed to provide
opportunities for adult education practitioners and researchers to share
and discuss the most current research findings and practitioner wisdom.
It will engage practitioners and researchers with questions related to
goals, accountability, and efficacy and efficiency in policy, practice,
and research. The ultimate goals of the symposium are to highlight
systemic changes that can enhance literacy practice and increase student
learning gains. The theme of this year's symposium is Systemic Change
and Student Success: What Does Research Tell Us? 

As in the first Meeting of the Minds Symposium that was held in 2004,
each session of the 2006 Symposium will be structured so that the
research presentation is followed by a panel of practitioners who will
discuss implications for practice or policy. In addition, conference
attendees will have opportunities for small group interaction and
networking with researcher-presenters to discuss not only how research
can inform practice and policy, but also how practice and policy can
inform and suggest a research agenda.      

More information about the Meeting of the Minds II symposium will be
available soon on the symposium Web site,  www.researchtopractice.org.
(This Web site currently lists presenters' PowerPoints and abstracts of
sessions held at the 2004 Meeting of the Minds symposium as well as
thoughts generated by attendees regarding implications of the research
findings.) We are in the process of updating this Web site to house
information about online registration for the 2006 symposium as well as
information about hotel registration. We will send out another notice
after the Web site has been updated. In the meantime, please save the
dates and plan to join us in November in Sacramento!

Thank you.

An Evidence-based Adult Education Program Model Appropriate for Research 

by John Comings, Lisa Soricone, and Maricel Santos 

The document reviews the available empirical evidence and professional
wisdom in order to define a program model that meets the requirements for
good practice. This program model describes what teachers, adult students,
counselors, administrators, volunteers, and program partners should do to
provide both effective instruction and the support services adults need to
persist in their learning long enough to be successful. This paper describes
a program model as having a program quality support component and three
chronological program components, which are entrance into a program,
participation in a program, and reengagement in learning. Though this model
could also be used as a description of good programs for other purposes,
here it describes the context in which research on approaches to instruction
and support services could be productive.

Learner's Engagement in Adult Literacy Education  

by Hal Beder, Jessica Tomkins, Patsy Medina, Regina Riccioni, and Weiling
Deng 

Engagement is mental effort focused on learning and is a precondition to
learning progress. It is important to understand how and why adult learners
engage in literacy instruction because engagement is a precondition to
learning progress. This study focused on how learning context shapes
engagement. The practical reason for doing so is that to a great extent
adult educators control the educational context. Thus if they understand how
the educational context shapes engagement, they can influence engagement in
positive ways.

Message-ID: <s446c72d.052@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm passing on this message from Cris Smith. It is a response to last
week's discussion about the differing findings of the FOB survey, and
the NCSALL Staff Development Study, in terms of teacher education level
and chances of incorporating ideas learned in PD. 

Julie
**********************************************

Cris here.  I directed the NCSALL professional development study, where
we
found that teachers with a bachelor's degree or less made fewer changes
in
thinking and acting after participating in professional development,
which
is different from the FOB evaluation, which found that those with
master's
degrees or above who responded to the Focus on Basics survey reported
making
more change in their classrooms or programs after reading Focus on
Basics.

I think one reason for the difference, in addition to the ones people
have
mentioned previously, might be the difference in the samples:  in our
professional development study, almost 100% of those participating were
primarily teachers.  In the Focus on Basics survey, only 33% identified
themselves primarily as teachers (although in both samples we had
administrators who did some teaching, and some teachers who did some
administrating).

One hypothesis for the differences between these two studies and the
amount
of change related to level of education might be that, according to what
we
found in the professional development study, administrators and others
have
more power to make change than do teachers, even at the classroom level.
 So
it could be that with the higher proportion of administrators and
non-teachers in the FOB sample, many of whom have post-graduate degrees,
they may be reporting more change because they are in a position to make
more change, whereas the PD study sample, which was mostly teachers and
where only half had masters' or above, were not in a position to make as
much change as a result of what they had learned.  Anyway, that's one
hypothesis.

It could also be a motivational issue.  It requires individual
initiative to
read Focus on Basics, and probably many people read articles on those
topics
about which they have the strongest motivation or recognize the issue as
a
problem in their work that needs solving.  Whereas, some proportion of
teachers who attend professional development (we found) are there for
reasons other than an interest in the topic or just a strong motivation
to
learn:  they may have been asked (or told) by their program
administrator to
attend the PD; it was on a free night or convenient to get to; someone
else
from their program was also attending so they went along; or they were
interested in our PD because it was part of a research project or they
liked
the idea of trying a different model of PD (practitioner research or
mentor
teacher group) that they hadn't tried before, but either weren't
interested
in the topic of the PD (learner persistence) or didn't recognize it as a
problem in their program or class.  All of these things, regardless of
education level, may affect what people learn and do after attending the
PD.
However, I still believe that the idea that more experienced, more
"degreed"
practitioners and administrators CAN become "settled" and not feel as if
they need to make changes in what they do.  If they are already doing a
good
job, they might be right, but in both the PD study and the FOB
evaluation,
we didn't look at teaching quality (as evidenced by student achievement)
so
we don't know if that's the case.  They could be "settled" teachers who
are
either very effective or not very effective at all.  But that's another
study.  Best...Cris

Wow, lots of ideas and information here.

First, regarding the differing findings of the two studies (the FOB
survey, and the NCSALL Staff Development Study, a lengthy research
projects)in one, those with less education were more likely to
incorporate ideas learned in professional development. In the other,
those with more education were likely to do the incorporating...
But perhaps the good news is that both groups, under certain conditions,
put professional development to use.

The issue that Janet writes about, of the conditions conducive to
engagement in professional development, are much the same issues we
think about when pondering how to enroll and engage ABE learners. The
need, the motivation, are important, but so are elements such as
availability, cost (free), accessibility, child care if needed, etc. And
a climate conducive to learning. I can't agree more that all the pieces
have to be in place. 

Has anyone experienced a considerable change in their program, toward a
climate more conducive to learning? And when I write "climate" I'm
thinking about both atmosphere and also particulars: paid release time,
substitutes available, support for trying new things, etc. What caused
the change? What can we learn from your experiences? How about change, I
hate to say it, in the opposite direction? What stifles professional
learning?

And continuing outreach, particularly to folks who don't know of FOB and
NCSALL as a resource, is a valuable reminder. Any suggestions of
concrete things NCSALL should be doing to bring itself and FOB to
teachers' attention?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 244] Re: teacher education and change

Janet and all

I have to agree strong with Janet's thoughts on motivation.  I train
adult ESL
teachers in MA TESOL program and many of them (of varying levels of
experience)
WANT to implement the ideas they read in FOB ... but when they get go
back to
their programs, they reported feeling frustrated that their programs
don't seem
to support innovation and creativity in teaching. If a program isn't
committed
at the program-level to fostering a "culture of change" (lots of stuff
out there
in K-12 about this), personal motivation can provide a point of entry
but is not
sufficient for meaningful impact.

At the same time I think we need to recognize the many ways that
teachers do
grow and develop that don't necessarily translate into measurable
learner gains.
Stephen Reder and his team in Portland have argued for a broader view on
learner
participation, beyond program attendance.  Perhaps we also need to begin
systematically accounting for the ways that teachers manage their own
professional growth and strive to develop professionally, outside of
formal pd
organizations and *in spite* of the lack of programmatic support.  

With FOB online, the series represents a rich library that a teacher
could turn
to for self-reflection. However there are still a lot of teachers out
there (I
meet them at TESOL conventions) who don't know about NCSALL or FOB.  If
FOB is
facing the end of its publishing run, it seems strategic to think how
NCSALL
might use its remaining FOB funds to expand its outreach. 

Best, Maricel Santos

I'm not sure this is allowed at TESOL unless one pays for a vendor's booth?     It may sound far-fetched and 'tacky,' but I do believe that in a TESOL-type environment it could be effective.    In 'prior lives' I've been seen cavorting as the Easter bunny, a Santa's elf, a homeless wretch from the streets, a cookie, and more * so this task would be an easy one for someone with my quirky personality!   Maybe there are others who would be willing to join me?  Or maybe this is just too silly of an image for quality publications?

A more 'tried and true' way would be to put together a panel presentation * which means submitting * SOON * proposals.   This, too, can be effective, but for a smaller number of people.
 
Personally speaking, connections and awarenesses gained from attending TESOL and other PD conferences have greatly influenced my life.

Holly's suggestions are good ones.  I'm less of a fan of the placard approach
(but thanks, Holly, for being willing to put yourself out there!) but I'm very
supportive of any proposals for the 2007 TESOl convention that could spotlight
FOB.  Could Holly and others work with NCSALL leaders to put together a panel of
presentations on how FOB has been used by teachers in their classrooms?

I attend TESOL every year so would be willing to support people in this approach.  

NCSALL hasn't had the kind of outreach funds to attend lots of conferences so
its presence at TESOL has been on and off.  For the past 3 conventions, Lisa
Soricone and I, and most recently with Winston Lawrence and Tilla Elahi from
NYC, have presented on the health literacy study circles which gives us a reason
to talk about NCSALL to TESOL folks.

Take care, maricel santos

Holly and all,

Thanks so much for thinking about ways to promote NCSALL and FOB. As you
can imagine, we are very interested in doing whatever we can to attract
funding and keep FOB going. We would love to talk about ways to promote
at TESOL, and other places. I will also be at COABE next week--too late
for anything formal, but I'd be happy to work on some informal
promotion.

Barb has been on vacation this week and will be back on Monday. Perhaps
next week we can continue this conversation and collectively come up
with some ideas. We appreciate all your support so much!

All the best,

Julie

Has there ever been any discussion about going international? The border
between Canada and the USA is the largest factor separating the issues and
concerns regarding adult literacy, adult learning, adult education or what
ever other terminology we use to describe this area.
I have been involved in all of the above and have found your information

Hi Everyone,

If any of you are going to the COABE conference next week, please
consider joining my colleagues, who are presenting a session about this
and other discussion lists from the National Institute for Literacy.
Find out how you can get more out of them.

Read on for more information about the session:

*********************************************

Dear Colleagues: 


Please join us in the following session at this year?s COABE National
Conference

in Houston, Texas: 


Professional Development From Your ?Inbox?: Making the Most of National
Discussion Lists

Saturday, 9:45 ? 11:00

Presented by NIFL Discussion List Moderators:

Jackie Taylor, Adult Literacy Professional Development List

Marie Cora, Assessment List

Daphne Greenberg, Women & Literacy List 


National online discussion lists provide an opportunity for ongoing
professional development with colleagues, researchers,
nationally-recognized experts and leaders in the field. Presenters will
provide information regarding the National Institute for Literacy's
discussion lists, emerging and key issues for each topic, upcoming
discussion activities, and how to get the most from your discussion list
subscription.

These are all great ideas. I'm working on a resource matrix for instructors where I work. I am definitely going to include information like this for them. I'm trying to encourage other instructors to invest even a small amount of time reading information related to adult education practices.

one more small, but maybe significant step if many of us can do it:

I have links to a number of specific FOB pieces on my website, and almost
always include them as resources when I facilitate workshops.  Another way
to infuse, disseminate and otherwise make people aware of -- and help them
towards using - the resource.

Message-ID: <s44e040b.056@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I am passing on a message from the Literacy President Group. This group
helps those of us who care about adult literacy in this country to
participate in the process of encouraging the next administration to
support adult literacy education. 

All the best,

Julie
________________________________

Dear Colleague,

We need your opinion and your vote.  Literacy President 2008 is a non- 
partisan effort to increase national awareness of adult literacy  
regardless of whom is elected.  Literacy President provides members  
of the adult education community with ways to be active participants  
in the 2008 Presidential election.  The first activity was generating  
possible questions to ask the candidates.  We now have 20 possible  
questions, and they need to be narrowed to the top five.

This is your chance to vote on these, to help us narrow them to the  
top five best questions.  In the 2004 election, Literacy President  
had over 1000 people -- practitioners, adult learners and others --  
who voted for  the top priority questions. This time our goal is 1500  
people participating: students, practitioners and other advocates for  
adult literacy.

To vote, please go to

Thanks to everyone who volunteered to be on the editorial board for "Focus on Basics" 8C. 

I wish I could give everyone a chance. Here's how I selected:

1) US based (thanks to the Canadians who offered, but since the publication is funded by the US government, I prioritized people working on adult literacy in the US)
2) No prior experience working on Focus on Basics or Focus on Basics related publications--we like to make the opportunity available to the greatest number of people possible
3) From different states and states less represented in FOB or on the FOB board (Sorry, Colorado...I heard from lots of you!)
4) First come first serve

Right now I can't say to volunteer next time, because I don't know if there will be a next time. Time will tell.
Thanks again for your support and willingness to do a lot of work!

Glad to hear that Focus on Basics is useful in Canada. To answer your question, we talked many years ago with some large Canadian literacy organizations about the possibility of having them subscribe so their constituents could get the published (vs. online) version of FOB, but nothing came of it.
We've published an article in 7B by Tracy Defoe and Sue Folinsbee about their work in workplace education in Canada, and we know we have some Canadian readers. We also have a strong following in New Zealand!

Has there ever been any discussion about going international? The border
between Canada and the USA is the largest factor separating the issues and
concerns regarding adult literacy, adult learning, adult education or what
ever other terminology we use to describe this area.
I have been involved in all of the above and have found your information
extremely helpful despite the fact that it is not Canadian based.

	Guide!
Message-ID: <s44f4def.029@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I would like to announce a new health literacy resource guide that has
just been published in print and on the Web!

Family Health and Literacy 

This guide to easy-to-read health materials and websites is for adult
literacy practitioners and  health educators alike. It lists resources
to teach health to families with lower literacy skills, but also
discusses how to integrate health and literacy education, how to get
started and engage adult learners, and how to build connections between
literacy programs and local health services.  

You can find Family Health and Literacy online at:

www.worlded.org/us/health/docs/family

This is a PDF, and with Adobe Reader 7 or higher you can click on the
live links! 

Hard copies are also available free of charge for a limited time: please
contact Leah_Peterson at worlded.org

I hope you find it helpful.

All the best,

Julie

I'm wondering if it is at all possible for multiple postings to be sent to 
the lists as one message rather than as separate messages.  I ask this 
because I am a member of 12 of the 13 listservs and every time there is a 
multiple message, I receive it 12 times.  As you can imagine this fills up 
my inbox quite a bit.  It is rather easy to do by creating a group listing 
in your address book (like I've done with this message).

I am sure that there are other listserv participants who are members of 
multiple lists as well who would appreciate this consideration.  Thank 
you.

Dear Colleagues,

We are happy to announce that the National Institute for Literacy has launched a new web page design to help provide easily accessible, high quality information about literacy. New features clearly highlight the Institute's work in all areas of literacy, including early childhood, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. You will continue to find the links to all of the Institute's projects, such as Bridges to Practice, LINCS, Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles under Programs and Services. The Institute's publications, including the recently released Teaching Reading to Adults can be found under the Publications link. Please visit http://www.nifl.gov for more information.

This is phase one of the redesign. We will soon be incorporating all the Institute's projects into this new design.  As many of you know, websites are always a work in progress and we intend to continue improving the Institute's site in order to provide you with the best available resources.	

We would love to hear your thoughts regarding the new look. Please send your comments to Jo Maralit at mmaralit at nifl.gov.   

Thanks,

	Currents Newsletter
Message-ID: <7E0B624DDF68104F92C38648A4D93D8FF6A123@MAIL.cal.local>

Hello everyone:  The following new resources from the Center for Adult
English Language Acquisition may be of interest to readers focus on
basics discussion list members:

Multilevel Brief

Last fall CAELA met with our advisory board, the Technical Work Group
(TWG), to discuss CAELA's work, including topics for our briefs. The
topic "multilevel classes" was high on our to-do list, having been
suggested to us by many practitioners and others in the states we work
with across the country. Our TWG, however, advised us to move beyond
saying what teachers can do in the classroom to engage the interest of
all learners in their classes while helping them achieve their often
diverse educational goals. Our TWG suggested we also talk about what
administrators can do to help ensure the success of these classes-- how
administrators might support teachers in multilevel classes. 

The brief, Promoting the Success of Multilevel ESL Classes: What
Teachers and Administrators Can Do, is now completed and online at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/multilevel.html. and in
pdf at http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/briefs/multilevel.pdf.


CAELA Currents

Also online is the new issue of our newsletter CAELA Currents at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/ccapr06.html    

Articles in this April 2006 publication include information about a new
teacher might use the CAELA Web site for professional development at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/ccapr06.html#web

Information about the available statistics on the training and education
levels of adult ESL teachers
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/ccapr06.html#questions

as well as information about recent publications of interest to the
field such as the joint publication by Senior Service America, Inc and
staff at the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) entitled Engaging
Immigrant Seniors in Community Service and Employment Programs: A Guide
for Providers. The guide provides background information on immigrant
seniors in the United States and gives practical advice for employers
and co-workers working with seniors from linguistically and culturally
diverse backgrounds. More information on this free publication and how
to obtain it is available at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/ccapr06.html#seniors

*******************************************************
I am pleased to announce that Esmerelda Doreste, Program Director with
the 
Union City (NJ) Adult Learning Center, will be a guest on the list from

administered by the Equipped for the Future (EFF) Center in the late 
winter, Ms. Doreste worked with her program to implement a program 
improvement process based on the EFF program quality model.
Along with the four other participants, Ms. Doreste wrote about that 
experience...her story is now accessible on the "Program Leadership and 
Improvement" web site. Go to [http://pli.cls.utk.edu] and click the 
"Stories of Program Improvement" button, then click/open "Union City
Adult

Hi Everyone, 

Finally, the moment you've all been waiting for...

The newest Focus On Basics, on learners' Experiences, is now available
on NCSALL's web site:

www.ncsall.net. 

Here's a preview from editor Barb Garner:
*************************************************
Quick, tell me about your students' self esteem. Low, because of their
academic struggles? That's not what a recent NCSALL-Rutgers study
showed.

And how about reading? Do your learners know that to increase their
reading fluency, they need to...read? What kind of and how much reading
do they do outside of class? Another NCSALL-Rutgers study follows three
learners as they go about their days and finds quite a variety in the
amount of reading the learners do on their own.

Teachers, have you ever seen yourself teach? Or noticed just what that
clump of students was doing while you were engaged with one person on
another side of the classroom? Teachers working with NCSALL-Rutgers
found that videos taken of their classroom for research purposes
provided them with rich information useful to their own professional
development. Learn how useful video can be in helping pinpoint issues
and suggest new ways of doing things in the classroom.

There's lots more, particularly around learner engagement.
Go to www.ncsall.net and click on "Newest Issue of Focus on Basics"
Printed copies and a text-only web version will not be out for another
two weeks.

the Adult Reading Components Study (ARCS).  They will be available for one
week to answer your questions and to introduce you to the ARCS interactive
Web site, designed to help teachers with assessing and teaching reading.

To subscribe, go to: http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/specialtopics

Before the discussion begins on May 23rd, please look at a 30-minute video
panel discussion on the ARCS, streamed on the National Institute for
Literacy Web site, or on DVD.

Research coming out the NCSALL Lab School in Portland, OR, finds that many people who have participated in ABE or would be good candidates for ABE study on their own. 

Has anyone's program taken this into account and put into place supports for students who want to continue to study on their own when not actively participating in a program? If so, what do these supports look like? How has it gone?

I'm not exactly sure I understand the question or if I read it
correctly. At first glance however, what springs to mind for me is my
students who study outside of class as well as attend on a regular or
semi-regular basis.  My most successful students are the ones who study
in and out of class. They'll ask for additional work or they'll work
online via several computer programs we use. They'll even actively seek
out information online to use as study aids such as math websites or

Research coming out the NCSALL Lab School in Portland, OR, finds that
many people who have participated in ABE or would be good candidates for
ABE study on their own. 

Has anyone's program taken this into account and put into place
supports for students who want to continue to study on their own when
not actively participating in a program? If so, what do these supports
look like? How has it gone?

It's great, Katrina, that you have students who do homework while a program is in session and even more wonderful that some do online work during school breaks.

You're right, though, my interest right now, is a little different: I"m curious about whether anyone is expressly doing things to let students know that if they have to stop coming for some reason, they can continue to study on their own. Does anyone do that, and introduce students to self-study materials they can purchse or borrow, or online resources?

I thought I might have misunderstood. However, I do think my program is
moving in the direction you're talking about. I know we're looking at
growing our distance education component in basic skills to do just what
you're talking about. We want to be able to reach students who can't
come to a "normal/regular" class time but who are motivated to learn on
their own.  The software we use has an online component to it that makes
this a viable option for us - in addition we're looking at creating some
components similar to blackboard courses that we can offer that address
the needs of our students as well. What we've talked about doing is at
least having them come out to do a pre/post test, some kind of midterm
and some kind of exit exam if they're adult high school oriented and if
they're GED oriented, they would have to come on campus to take their
practice test and the offical test. If they're improving they're basic
skills for employment etc, they would just need to demonstrate progress
on their pre/post test scores.  There are ways to capture "seat" time
for such students as well even if they are not part of a "traditona"
environment. The whole idea is to find ways to help students progress
towards their goal even when they feel like life is preventing them from
doing so. We also have video component with workbook materials. Students
who can't come/enroll in a class can "check" out the videos, complete
the workbook component and any other materials that the instructor deems
necessary and still make progress towards whatever the desired
goal/outcome might be.  What we run into is trying not to pull students
from the existing classes for these options but to actually target the 
information to that population who really needs this kind of option in
order to pursue their goals.
We're only in the beginning phases of this - well, we've been working on
it for almost a year and still trying to get the glitches out.

Katrina, 
Can you share some specifics? How do you announce its availability to those connected with your program? If someone stops coming, for example, do you call or visit them with the online resource as an option? 
What strategies are you trying to keep it from being an invitation for active students to decide to, in effect, telecommute?

Does anyone else out there do any kind of distance education or have
methods to keep students studying when have to drop class for a while?
Part of the NCSALL research Barb mentioned suggests that most students,
over the course of several years, are forced to move in and out of class
programs, due to changing life circumstances. This means that programs
will need to move toward offering support for students to keep learning
during their out-of-class phases. So it is interesting to hear about
Katrina's program and others that are working towards that. 

Katrina, I'm also curious to know what you mean when you put students
"in the database" and what your "online component" is like?

As it happens, we are creating a program for ESL learners to engage in
self-study. It's not quite "out of school", and yet it offers some
supports that might be relevant.

A little background:  At Goodwill Industries in Portland, Oregon, we
offer ESL classes to novice through intermediate level employees at
their worksites during their paid working time. When it works it's
fantastic, but if a worksite has fewer than three people at a similar
level of language ability, we are unable to offer a class to those
employees.

As we have very motivated employees who want ESL help, we're currently
constructing an ESL self-study program to encourage and aid those
employees that are not able to participate in our regular programs. Some
of the supports we will offer are:

Bimonthly 60-90 minute meetings with an ESL practitioner 

Language exchange partners at the worksite for weekly or biweekly lunch
sessions

An extensive choice of materials from our program library 

Information about and encouragement to participate in English language
activities offered by our organization and in the community

Pre-, mid- and post- study language assessment

We will be starting this program within a month--I wish I could tell you
how it will work!

Hi Barb,
Our students sometimes return from prison to towns where they do not 
have easy access to our community campuses . In one such case, I had a 
student who needed just two more credits to graduate, but he was moving 
out of state. I provided him with assignments to complete and return to 
me by mail, sort of a correspondence course, I guess. The outcome was 
not what I hoped for. He called me once, but never did any of the 
assignments.

We have found that our students often do very well in school when they 
are incarcerated, but many forces conspire to make continued schooling 
difficult after they get out. In prison, their basic needs are met, 
meals, health care, warmth, bed, clothing, etc. On their own back in the 
community, they have to work hard to provide these things for 
themselves. Other issues such as family, social, job, transportation and 
other responsibilities required of them by their probation office (e.g. 
substance abuse counseling, restitution, etc.) interfere with their 
ability to attend classes and progress stops. We have not yet found a 
good solution for these folks.

A few of us have been thinking about putting some sort of online 
distance learning program on our school web site, but this is only in 
the dream stage right now.

We use myskillstutor and A+  anywhere for online instruction. We're
looking at building/designing blackboard courses as well but havent'
started those yet. The database refers to the database for both

Part of the NCSALL research Barb mentioned suggests that most
students,
over the course of several years, are forced to move in and out of
class
programs, due to changing life circumstances. This means that programs
will need to move toward offering support for students to keep
learning
during their out-of-class phases. So it is interesting to hear about
Katrina's program and others that are working towards that. 

Katrina, I'm also curious to know what you mean when you put students

I thought I might have misunderstood. However, I do think my program
is
moving in the direction you're talking about. I know we're looking at
growing our distance education component in basic skills to do just
what
you're talking about. We want to be able to reach students who can't
come to a "normal/regular" class time but who are motivated to learn
on
their own.  The software we use has an online component to it that
makes
this a viable option for us - in addition we're looking at creating
some
components similar to blackboard courses that we can offer that
address
the needs of our students as well. What we've talked about doing is at
least having them come out to do a pre/post test, some kind of midterm
and some kind of exit exam if they're adult high school oriented and
if
they're GED oriented, they would have to come on campus to take their
practice test and the offical test. If they're improving they're basic
skills for employment etc, they would just need to demonstrate
progress
on their pre/post test scores.  There are ways to capture "seat" time
for such students as well even if they are not part of a "traditona"
environment. The whole idea is to find ways to help students progress
towards their goal even when they feel like life is preventing them
from
doing so. We also have video component with workbook materials.
Students
who can't come/enroll in a class can "check" out the videos, complete
the workbook component and any other materials that the instructor
deems
necessary and still make progress towards whatever the desired
goal/outcome might be.  What we run into is trying not to pull
students
from the existing classes for these options but to actually target the

information to that population who really needs this kind of option in

We're only in the beginning phases of this - well, we've been working

This message is in response to Julie's question and is from Diana Satin
who is not presently on the listserve:

Hello there --

Our school has just started a program like that. We invite ESL students
who 
are SPL (student performance level) 4-6 from our wait list and SPL 4-6

students who have been in our regular, face-to-face classes but had to
stop 
for a time or drop out because of a change in their work schedule,
family 
illness, etc. We're using the free English for All course, along with 
writing assignments, and telephone/in-person work on conversation and 
pronunciation. Students are *quite* appreciative of this opportunity to

study when they can fit it into their busy schedules, and we're very
glad to 
be able to offer it. It fills an important void in the educational
needs 
people in our communities have.

We consider students enrolled after they've completed the two
orientation 
meetings.

We assess them using REEP at the second orientation meeting, and again
later 
on in the year. Neither the BEST nor the REEP is a perfect fit for EFA,
but 
they are the only standardized assessments available for ESL at the
moment, 
and the REEP fits better because of the predominant use of text in the

curriculum.

Sometimes, when students have to stop classes for a while, our program
has 
also set them up with a tutor to work individually.

Hope this helps. I'd love to hear about others' programs as well.

Hello,
In Massachusetts we are piloting a distance learning initiative with six
programs throughout the state.  Visit our website at
www.anywhereanytimeabe.org .  You will see in the section, "Meet the DL
Programs", that all of the programs are slightly different in program
design, population served, curriculum, and delivery of services.

Our initiative serves learners who are not able to attend regular classes.
Some of our dl programs have developed a strong relationship with the
classroom based program in their agency so that learners who stop out of a
regular class are able to transition into the distance learning program
immediately.  This strong relationship entails not only making appropriate
referrals to the distance learning program, but also preparing the learner
for independent learning while they are still in the classroom.  When time
management skills, computer literacy, goal setting,and study skills are a
part of both the classroom and dl curricula, the transition for learners
will go more smoothly and they are more likely to remain engaged.  The key
is to develop that relationship between the classroom and the dl program
staff so that they can create a referral system and a curriculum that will
prepare the learner for self-directed study.

it for almost a year and still trying to get the glitches out.

It's great, Katrina, that you have students who do homework while a
program is in session and even more wonderful that some do online work
during school breaks.

You're right, though, my interest right now, is a little different:
I"m
curious about whether anyone is expressly doing things to let students
know that if they have to stop coming for some reason, they can
continue
to study on their own. Does anyone do that, and introduce students to
self-study materials they can purchse or borrow, or online resources?

I'm not exactly sure I understand the question or if I read it
correctly. At first glance however, what springs to mind for me is my
students who study outside of class as well as attend on a regular or
semi-regular basis.  My most successful students are the ones who
study
in and out of class. They'll ask for additional work or they'll work
online via several computer programs we use. They'll even actively
seek
out information online to use as study aids such as math websites or
practice test websites etc.  We don't have any formal supports in
place
for students but I do know that sometimes teachers will come by and
say
'can you put John/Jane Smith in the database so they can do some work
online during Spring Break or Semester Break etc." Most of the time
when
I've encountered students who are not actively participating in class
or
in a program, it's usually because they don't have the time to devote
to
studying whether it's because of work, family or personal reasons etc.
We do try to accomodate students though and our online component
allows
us to help students who sometimes cannot attend a traditional
classroom
setting.  At the moment that's all I can think of.

Research coming out the NCSALL Lab School in Portland, OR, finds that
many people who have participated in ABE or would be good candidates
for
ABE study on their own.

Has anyone's program taken this into account and put into place
supports for students who want to continue to study on their own when
not actively participating in a program? If so, what do these supports
look like? How has it gone?

Yes * Charlottesville City Schools (Charlottesville VA) has been piloting a very successful ESL at Home program since October 2005, via an EL/Civics grant.   Although not yet cost-effective, student success has been great!

We've modeled our program similar to one used by North Carolina (LEAD program) and are using Crossroads Cafe video series as our curriculum.  We have had our first two 'graduates' this month (finishing all 26 episodes, worktexts, and a review test after each episode)!  
We've had several learners show reportable gains, many many many anecdotal success stories.   

We have an optional virtual classroom on the internet, http://theHsmile.org (then ESL at Home with Crossroads Cafe] using MOODLE.  http://www.moodle.org) as our Course Management System (CMS).

Enrollment for this class is ongoing (the only ongoing open enrollment course in our Adult Learning Center's program); we began with 6 students in October, have had a total of 46 to date, with approx. 30% dropping out before sufficient hours completed to 'officially count' them.   31 of the 46 who have registered into our pilot group so far have registered on our virtual website, over 20 are active on the site.  The virtual classroom has many supplemental activities: discussion forums, resources, quizzes, assignments, a chat function, more!   

I'm happy to share more details (off the discussion list) for anyone interested.

Part of the NCSALL research Barb mentioned suggests that most students,
over the course of several years, are forced to move in and out of class
programs, due to changing life circumstances. This means that programs
will need to move toward offering support for students to keep learning
during their out-of-class phases. So it is interesting to hear about

It's encouraging to learn about so many different models of out-of-school study in use around the country...

Does anyone ask learners on intake whether they have been doing
self-study before coming to enroll? If so, do you have any sense of what
proportion of your learners did? And why are they choosing to enroll if
they have been studying on their own?

Have you checked with your local community college or university for
their on-line catalog? Many institutions have these services now. If you
connect this prisoner to his/her local institution, he/she might
continue there when they are on the outside.  It might depend on how
long the prisoner has left on the inside to make it realistic and on
what their financial capability is.  You may need to be a liaison if
there are any required on campus meetings or tests that can't be
completed on-line.  Most prisons do NOT have access for on-line
computers for inmates so you're probably looking at hard copy courses.

The ESL at Home pilot offers optional f2f study session times, one afternoon, one evening each week, and students who are able to attend are the most successful.  We use volunteers (two to four per study session) to work 1:1 or small groups with students studying the same episode of Crossroads Cafe, to answer questions,  listening as students practice speaking and pronunciation exercises.   These sessions are wild times!   Students may be reviewing, reading transcripts, (for any of the 26 episodes... because it's ongoing enrollment and self-paced, students are NOT all in the same place of the curriculum!), waiting for a speaking test, watching a review test tape for listening questions, taking written tests, picking up work, exchanging borrowed DVDs and VHS tapes, more!   Some students cannot attend these sessions.   Once a month I meet some on a Saturday morning at a local library across town.   Others I make appointments for sporadically as they complete work (there is a reveiw test given after each episode).   For two students, we're experimenting with telephone and/or recorded  speaking tests, and snail-mail or drop-off for their completed work.    As a pilot, we're experimenting with various options.   
Evaluating all aspects and working towad the cost effectiveness will be a strong component of the next phase of our pilot effort.

There is a program called CRIMINON that addresses basic literacy inmates
and criminal thinking.  They are international in scope and have
programs in the USA and Mexico.  Go to criminon.org for more information
and an organization closest to you.  I've used their curriculum with in
the prison system and seen the positive changes it makes in the criminal
thinking process.

I went to a very interesting presentation at TESOL probably three years ago.
The presenter talked about a program they had instituted in conjunction with
the public libraries. I believe it might have been with Crossroads Caf?.
(and it might have been in Virginia or California). Anyway, if someone was
interested in checking out a video, they had them take a quick pre-test (ten
questions or less). When they returned the tape, they took a short
post-test, so there was a way of documenting progress. The thing I was most
impressed with, though, was that when they looked at the people who were
using the tapes, they found out that they were mainly young Hispanic wives
who said they would NOT go to a class. So it was a great way of reaching a
population that would otherwise not be served.

It's encouraging to learn about so many different models of out-of-school
study in use around the country...

Does anyone ask learners on intake whether they have been doing
self-study before coming to enroll? If so, do you have any sense of what
proportion of your learners did? And why are they choosing to enroll if
they have been studying on their own?

Yes * Charlottesville City Schools (Charlottesville VA) has been piloting a
very successful ESL at Home program since October 2005, via an EL/Civics
grant.   Although not yet cost-effective, student success has been great!

We've modeled our program similar to one used by North Carolina (LEAD
program) and are using Crossroads Cafe video series as our curriculum.  We
have had our first two 'graduates' this month (finishing all 26 episodes,
worktexts, and a review test after each episode)!  
We've had several learners show reportable gains, many many many anecdotal
success stories.   

We have an optional virtual classroom on the internet, http://theHsmile.org
(then ESL at Home with Crossroads Cafe] using MOODLE.
http://www.moodle.org) as our Course Management System (CMS).

Enrollment for this class is ongoing (the only ongoing open enrollment
course in our Adult Learning Center's program); we began with 6 students in
October, have had a total of 46 to date, with approx. 30% dropping out
before sufficient hours completed to 'officially count' them.   31 of the 46
who have registered into our pilot group so far have registered on our
virtual website, over 20 are active on the site.  The virtual classroom has
many supplemental activities: discussion forums, resources, quizzes,
assignments, a chat function, more!   

I'm happy to share more details (off the discussion list) for anyone
interested.

Does anyone else out there do any kind of distance education or have
methods to keep students studying when have to drop class for a while?
Part of the NCSALL research Barb mentioned suggests that most students,
over the course of several years, are forced to move in and out of class
programs, due to changing life circumstances. This means that programs
will need to move toward offering support for students to keep learning
during their out-of-class phases. So it is interesting to hear about
Katrina's program and others that are working towards that.

Michael,
 
I work for the Fortune Society and would be happy to provide you with
any information I can about our work. Fortune works with several
thousand ex-prisoners a year. We provide counseling, career development
and job readiness, substance abuse treatment, HIV peer education, health
and housing services for those former prisoners who are HIV positive. We
run four alternative to incarceration programs and have a 59 bed
transitional housing center in Harlem.
 
And of course we have an education program which serves over 400 people
per year. We offer classes in small groups from basic literacy through
pre-GED as well as ESOL. We have a very active computer lab,
www.fortunesociety.org/education.  
 
Many of the comments Tom made in his email are true for students here. I
would mention, as well, that many of them are now back in environments
which conspire against success. Many are homeless, and finding a job is
very difficult for people coming out of prison, especially a job that
will pay the rent here in New York City. Many lack strong family support
systems. The lure of the streets and harassment from the police take
their toll as well. Some are mandated here by the courts or pushed by
their probation officer. Education is not always on the top of people's
priority list. 
 
Despite all that, this can be a very exciting place to work. Most people
at Fortune are in a process of trying to make profound changes in their
lives. There is a lot of transformation happening, and it's a privilege
to be able to play a small part in that. 
 
I'd be happy to discuss working with ex-prisoners further if people are
interested. We have a lot of experience, but we certainly have a lot to
learn as well.

Tom,

 

That was  a valuable observation about access to educational programs
inside prison (where basic needs are met) and outside.  Does anyone know
of any literature on some of these programs, like NYC's Fortune Society,
which address themselves to ex-offenders?  Thanks, Michael

My name is Gina Lobaccaro, and I have taught at Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown, DE for more than 15 years. I have taught Special Education level students between 18-21 yrs, ABE, GED, adult high school, and college level incarcerated students.  Just today, an inmate who I have seen come in and out of prison for a while, told me that he wants to make a commitment to improving his reading (is now 4-5th GE) and academic skills when he gets out.  He has three months here, at least six months in a treatment program in a lower level of security, and I think 15 months of "aftercare" probation.  
I told him about Delaware's James H. Groves High School Diploma at a Distance program and our ABE at a Distance Program.  I am co-ordinating with the instructor at the ABE program to confirm that she still uses the same program I have in my computer lab for the ABE students.  If so, I will teach him to use the program now and perhaps we can find a way for him to continue with some academic learning support at the Work Release Program until he can access a computer again on the outside.  
He sounded motivated.
And then I opened this message and it is very interesting to me.
I help manage the corrections site at the Research and Practice Wiki at http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Main_Page
The corrections page is at http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Corrections_Education
One of the sections at the corrections page is about ex-offender resources.
It might be a good place to begin a "community of practice" for those of us who are interested in this topic. The is the first paragraph on them main page:
You can learn about the adult literacy education field here, including English language learning, numeracy, and adult basic and secondary education. You can also add knowledge from your experience teaching adult learners, from your research, or from your experience as an adult learner. The ALE Wiki is an online professional development environment, a community of practice rich in professional wisdom and with links to research, for teachers, other practitioners, researchers, learners and others. Although some people add to the discussion here, it is not like an electronic list (or "listserv") where dialogue may be frequent and lively. For the most part, the discussion has taken place on electronic lists elsewhere and been archived here. 

Please let me know if it might be worthwhile to start a discussion directly related to this topic (or perhaps this is it?) and I will keep the discussion thread on the Wiki site updated.  

A ways back on this thread Tom Woods wrote:

> A few of us have been thinking about putting some sort of online

Perhaps we could use the Wiki to start gathering together resources, research, discussion toward the goal for building this type of distance learning program that would serve as a model for any prison education/community education program that serves ex- offenders.

What do you think?

Hi Everyone,

Below is a message I am forwarding to the list from Jane Eguez from CASAS in relation to the discussion of supporting out of school study:

Julie
*******************************************************
The California Distance Learning Project (CDLP) goal is to help expand learner access to adult basic education services in California. 
For over 10 years they have assisted CA adult education programs and CA Dept of Education to:
**Build and Promote a Distance Learning Knowledge Base 
**Provide Technical Assistance in Implementing Distance Learning 
**Test New Instructional Delivery Methods / Materials 
**Help Create a Statewide Distance Learning Infrastructure 
http://www.cdlponline.org

The California Adult Education 2003 - 2005 Innovation and Alternative
Instructional Delivery Program - A Review (To read the full report, go to: http://www.cdlponline.org/pdf/innovation_programs_report03-05.pdf)

"State legislation permits California adult schools to spend up to 5% of their apportionment on non traditional educational approaches. The resulting "Innovation Programs" continue to grow while overall adult education remains relatively static. Over 50,000 adult learners participated in 81 Innovation Programs, all of which were distance learning in nature.

When comparing classroom data with the Innovation Programs, it is clear that the distance learning programs are particularly successful in providing ESL learning opportunities. Local research data on student persistence and retention support these findings.

The Innovation Programs meet the three crucial benefit-cost criteria necessary to be accepted by adult education providers and the California Department of Education. These programs are effective, efficient, and equitable. This is the fifth year that these summary conclusions have been supported. They indicate the continued success of the Innovation Program initiative.

This data driven report draws information from the annual Innovation Program applications, the statewide student information system - TOPSPro, and from statewide CASAS reading and listening tests. The availability of these standardized data enables researchers to describe and examine distance learning program characteristics, learner characteristics, and learner progress and outcomes using several measures. The result is the most complete look at adult education distance learning programs available.

The Innovation Programs provide significant and meaningful alternatives for adults -
* needing more practice of skills to achieve mastery,
* having work and family obligations that make attending a regular class time difficult,
* lacking the full confidence to participate in a large classroom setting in front of other students,
* wanting the participation, assistance, and support of their families in their learning,
* living in locations without convenient access to traditional classes,
* living in areas where desired programs are either full or not available
* learning more effectively from video, audio, and web-based media when moving at their own pace, and
* other groups who can not access traditional classroom programs.

Hello Katrina, Barbara and others,

Katrina, is myskillstutor the student log-in page for the online   
computer-assisted instruction product,  "Skills Tutor" ? I am not  
familiar with "A+ Anywhere".  Is this the A+ Anywhere Learning  
System? [ http://www.amered.com/awl_products.php ] ?  Can you tell us  
how you use these products, and when you would use one rather than  
the other?  Can you also tell us what you have in mind for developing  
your own online courses?  And are you using Blackboard because it is  
available to you or for some other reason?

Recently I have been trying to sort out "distance learning" from  
"integrated learning".  Here's the definition I am working from now.   
I wonder if this is useful to you, Katrina, as from your description  
you seem to be doing both?  I also wonder if this distinction is  
useful to you, Barbara?  It should be useful to funders who may need  
to decide what is/isn't distance learning.

Distance learning (DL) (whether pure, supported, or blended/hybrid)  
has as its main characteristic that students do not come to a face-to- 
face class or tutorial as their primary source of instruction. So  
this would include correspondence courses, online learning, and TV  
broadcast learning (often with accompanying print materials).  It  
might include a teacher (not primarily face-to-face in the same  
physical place.)  It might be available for people on waiting lists  
for classes. And it might be a way to help students who are primarily  
interested in self-study, with a little assistance from a Web site or  
online or telephone tutor, counselor and/or mentor.

Integrated learning (which uses technology and some elements of DL)   
is face-to-face classroom learning or tutorials with supplemental or  
temporary uses of online or digital learning resources.  This is a  
way to supplement, enrich or extend learning for those who come to  
class or tutorials, or to provide short-term solutions for those who  
temporarily cannot attend class, so they do not have to drop out.  
Face-to-face learning activities are integrated with online or  
digital media learning activities used in the program, at home, or  
elsewhere.

Students might access digital learning activities for either DL or  
integrated models through the use of computers, dvd players, web- 
accessed mobile phones or pdas, MP3 players, and whatever is next in  
the evolving world of portable digital technology.

Of course, a DL student could become an Integrated learning student  
or vice versa.  And a self-study or waiting list learner might not  
(or might) be enrolled as a student.

I have been working on a concept I call a Seamless System of Adult  
Education and Literacy, particularly on the online component.  I will  
be glad to e-mail the current draft to those who may be interested.

I think our course are moving toward a hybrid model.  Some on-line and
remote home study and some in-class face to face instruction with
integration of technology in both.

Hello Katrina, Barbara and others,

Katrina, is myskillstutor the student log-in page for the online   
computer-assisted instruction product,  "Skills Tutor" ? I am not  
familiar with "A+ Anywhere".  Is this the A+ Anywhere Learning  
System? [ http://www.amered.com/awl_products.php ] ?  Can you tell us  
how you use these products, and when you would use one rather than  
the other?  Can you also tell us what you have in mind for developing  
your own online courses?  And are you using Blackboard because it is  
available to you or for some other reason?

Recently I have been trying to sort out "distance learning" from  
"integrated learning".  Here's the definition I am working from now.   
I wonder if this is useful to you, Katrina, as from your description

Clarifying terminology is useful. Thanks, David, for doing so. 

When I asked about "self-study" I was referring to people who decide to pick up a book, a cd study package, a tape, the internet and learn, without any affiliation to a program. In the FOB list context, I was referring to strengthening reading, writing, math skills, or improving English, or preparing for the GED.

The discussion focused on learners who had been affiliated with programs and for some reason needed to "stop out" but wanted to keep learning, so they switched to what might be considered "program-affiliated self study", which involves some resources (perhaps books, occasional meetings with teachers, some technology) and some loose connection to a program.

Hello Katrina, Barbara and others,

your own online courses?  And are you using Blackboard because it is  
available to you or for some other reason?

Recently I have been trying to sort out "distance learning" from  
"integrated learning".  Here's the definition I am working from now.   
I wonder if this is useful to you, Katrina, as from your description  
you seem to be doing both?  I also wonder if this distinction is  
useful to you, Barbara?  It should be useful to funders who may need  
to decide what is/isn't distance learning.

Distance learning (DL) (whether pure, supported, or blended/hybrid)  
has as its main characteristic that students do not come to a face-to- 
face class or tutorial as their primary source of instruction. So  
this would include correspondence courses, online learning, and TV  
broadcast learning (often with accompanying print materials).  It

for classes. And it might be a way to help students who are primarily  
interested in self-study, with a little assistance from a Web site or  
online or telephone tutor, counselor and/or mentor.

Integrated learning (which uses technology and some elements of DL)   
is face-to-face classroom learning or tutorials with supplemental or  
temporary uses of online or digital learning resources.  This is a  
way to supplement, enrich or extend learning for those who come to  
class or tutorials, or to provide short-term solutions for those who  
temporarily cannot attend class, so they do not have to drop out.  
Face-to-face learning activities are integrated with online or  
digital media learning activities used in the program, at home, or  
elsewhere.

Students might access digital learning activities for either DL or  
integrated models through the use of computers, dvd players, web- 
accessed mobile phones or pdas, MP3 players, and whatever is next in  
the evolving world of portable digital technology.

Of course, a DL student could become an Integrated learning student  
or vice versa.  And a self-study or waiting list learner might not  
(or might) be enrolled as a student.

I have been working on a concept I call a Seamless System of Adult  
Education and Literacy, particularly on the online component.  I will  
be glad to e-mail the current draft to those who may be interested.

Clarifying terminology is useful. Thanks, David, for doing so. 

When I asked about "self-study" I was referring to people who decide to
pick up a book, a cd study package, a tape, the internet and learn,
without any affiliation to a program. In the FOB list context, I was
referring to strengthening reading, writing, math skills, or improving
English, or preparing for the GED.

The discussion focused on learners who had been affiliated with programs
and for some reason needed to "stop out" but wanted to keep learning, so
they switched to what might be considered "program-affiliated self
study", which involves some resources (perhaps books, occasional
meetings with teachers, some technology) and some loose connection to a
program.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 297] Re: Supporting out of school study

Hello Katrina, Barbara and others,

Katrina, is myskillstutor the student log-in page for the online   
computer-assisted instruction product,  "Skills Tutor" ? I am not  
familiar with "A+ Anywhere".  Is this the A+ Anywhere Learning  
System? [ http://www.amered.com/awl_products.php ] ?  Can you tell us  
how you use these products, and when you would use one rather than  
the other?  Can you also tell us what you have in mind for developing  
your own online courses?  And are you using Blackboard because it is  
available to you or for some other reason?

Recently I have been trying to sort out "distance learning" from  
"integrated learning".  Here's the definition I am working from now.   
I wonder if this is useful to you, Katrina, as from your description  
you seem to be doing both?  I also wonder if this distinction is  
useful to you, Barbara?  It should be useful to funders who may need  
to decide what is/isn't distance learning.

Distance learning (DL) (whether pure, supported, or blended/hybrid)  
has as its main characteristic that students do not come to a face-to- 
face class or tutorial as their primary source of instruction. So  
this would include correspondence courses, online learning, and TV  
broadcast learning (often with accompanying print materials).  It  
might include a teacher (not primarily face-to-face in the same  
physical place.)  It might be available for people on waiting lists  
for classes. And it might be a way to help students who are primarily  
interested in self-study, with a little assistance from a Web site or  
online or telephone tutor, counselor and/or mentor.

Integrated learning (which uses technology and some elements of DL)   
is face-to-face classroom learning or tutorials with supplemental or  
temporary uses of online or digital learning resources.  This is a  
way to supplement, enrich or extend learning for those who come to  
class or tutorials, or to provide short-term solutions for those who  
temporarily cannot attend class, so they do not have to drop out.  
Face-to-face learning activities are integrated with online or  
digital media learning activities used in the program, at home, or  
elsewhere.

Students might access digital learning activities for either DL or  
integrated models through the use of computers, dvd players, web- 
accessed mobile phones or pdas, MP3 players, and whatever is next in  
the evolving world of portable digital technology.

Of course, a DL student could become an Integrated learning student  
or vice versa.  And a self-study or waiting list learner might not  
(or might) be enrolled as a student.

I have been working on a concept I call a Seamless System of Adult  
Education and Literacy, particularly on the online component.  I will  
be glad to e-mail the current draft to those who may be interested.

All - a few impressions about using video:

> impression?  Did it affect your teaching? How?

The most helpful thing about seeing a tape of my teaching was that the
colleague who made the tape was wise enough to focus almost entirely on the
students; I learned how I tend to teach to the left (to my physical left) -
so hadn't spent the kind of time I'd like to have on teaching around the
entire room.  My physical focus was limited to a part of the classroom.

As well, the sound of my voice alone was, well, more present than one would
have hoped for.  A lot more teacher talk than I'd have thought...

Students liked watching the tapes - especially a month or so after they'd
been made, where they could see progress they'd made between the time of the
taping and the time of the viewing.

perspective; a look at folks who I may not have been attentive to - what ARE
they doing, how do they interact with one another? -  as well as a sense of
the flow of a class.

Janet,

Thanks for sharing your reactions to your videotaped class! I am curious
to know how it came about, and how it was used. Was it a purposeful
professional development activity, or just something you decided to try?
And it's interesting that you watched it with your students--was there a
specific process that helped you get feedback from them? From other
colleagues?

It's interesting that you say one of the best things was that it focused
on the students, which fits with Jessica's experience as she described
in the article.

I had an eye opening experience using video years ago...about 1985! I was working with teachers in a refugee education program: I observed them in classes on a weekly basis. One teacher never ever smiled. She said she was concerned that her youth would undercut her credibility with the older Cambodians she was teaching, so she tried to appear stern. That didn't seem to be working: the atmosphere in her classroom seemed quite tense.
She said she'd try smiling, but it wasn't happening (as I write this I know it sounds strange, but it's true.) I tried a number of things, from collecting data on her facial expressions at intervals during the class to trying to catch her eye from the back of the room and smile.
Finally, I had her video taped. She watched the tape by herself, burst into tears (she reported), and totally changed her classroom manner, with, it was easy to see, great results.

I guess this long story is a reinforcement of Janet's post, and of Jessica's report: a picture can really tell a story...

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 310]  Discussion: video as a prof. devlpmt tool.
Message-ID: <448462FD.1050007@pdx.edu>

Greetings!

I am an extreme case: I was recorded at the NCSALL ESOL  Labschool for 4 years, several hours every week. (or about 1360 hours of my stellar performances.) So what I have to say is magnified by the experience.  Also the video was not meant to be a tool of professional development for the teachers who were filmed but rather a tool to comprehend learning and teaching, learners and teachers and the ties that bind them. In the process of doing research on SLA, and classroom behaviors, I have seen myself countless times, and of course I am my first critic.  My caution to anyone who wants to improve their teaching through numerous recordings is "don't do it" or you will go through the roller coaster of "How could I do that??" and "That was really smooth". With the first one, you begin to wonder whether you destroy students' eagerness to learn English or made them stop coming altogether.  The second reflection ends up raising the bar for the next class: can I do this again? What else can I possibly learn from this?  The reflection wheels never really stop. The thirst for perfection is never appeased. 

The most important point of watching classroom video is to see the students and watch them learn, not only English but classroom behaviors and social competencies which are developed in the safe environment of the classroom and replicable in the outside world. They do and say amazing things, pertinent to the task/ activity or outside of the activity but nonetheless important to them. 
On 3 and 4, the video of the classroom was used on a couple of occasions for study circles, directed by Reuel Kurzet, our professional developer . ( http://www.ncsall.net/?id=232  is the link which will lead you to her article on the matter).
Also over the past 4 years, we have had several graduate research assistants (GRAs) who worked on coding and transcribing the classrooms video data .  These GRAs were concurrently enrolled in the MA TESOL program at Portland State University.  Each one of them ( about 25) has been extremely grateful to have been privy to watching hours of classroom recording before actually becoming teachers themselves. 
As for myself, in the process of the longitudinal study of a few students, I have watched other teachers teach.  The great lesson has been to recognize good teaching, even though the techniques employed might be something that one would never do. (student engagement which is also captured through the video is a good indicator of  a successful class)  
So yes, video is a great tool for prof. development. One must be prepared to watch a classroom in "real time" though, which is different but a lot richer (and a lot slower) than "canned"  classroom videos, edited for the perfect lesson.

Hi everyone,
I've just read through the experiences everyone shared today and it's
interesting to see how much they resonate with those of the teachers we
worked with and who I interviewed for the article. First of all, even after
years of reviewing classroom video with teachers and chatting with them, I
had no idea how compelling the video of their own classrooms was to them.
(By the way I've never had the experience of being the one taped while
teaching, though now I'm curious to try it.) Hearing these new stories and
thinking about this topic again today, it occurs to me how the sort of
shock-value of seeing oneself teach (volume of voice, hand gestures, all
that kind of stuff one wouldn't be aware of otherwise - never smiling, as in
Barb's story) is one specific use video can be put to - something that
happened incidentally in our study and for most of us would probably best be
had as a one-time experience. Mostly, the teachers I interviewed (as well as
teachers posting comments today) benefitted from watching their learners,
and analysing their own teaching via their learners' behavior. Our research
videos were necessarily focused on learners, so they didn't always even
include the teachers directly. I wonder if this wouldn't be a good format
for video as a pd activity? It seems like it worked as well as it did
because the video and the surrounding discussing revolved almost entirely
around students. Could teachers just video their students and use the videos
to improve their own teaching? That seems like a very elegant way to do
this. Also, I like the idea of showing video to learners. We did this in our
study as well, but not over time. Especially in an ESOL class this seems
like a great and obvious tool both for teacher reflection and for learners
to get a sense of their own progress...Anyway, sorry so long. It's nice to
meet you guys and hear your thoughts on this topic-
Jessica

Hello Julie, Jessica, and others

As a teacher in training I was videotaped in 1969. VHS was relatively  
new then, but it was widely used in the University of Massachusetts  
Graduate School of Education. There was a protocol called  
_Microteaching_, which had been developed by Dwight Allen at Stanford  
in the mid 1960's, before he was the Dean of Education at UMass  
Amherst. For some information on Microteaching, see:
[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microteaching ]
[ http://fdc.fullerton.edu/learning/CASTL/ 
carnegie_microteaching_materials.htm ]

I remember getting three kinds of useful feedback ("feedback" was new  
jargon in education then):

1) seeing myself teach (not an entirely positive experience);
2) getting comments from other teacher trainees and a master teacher;  
and
3) getting comments from the students who were videotaped about what  
they thought I was trying to do, how effective it was, and what was  
happening from their perspectives.

Some of the comments from students were especially helpful.  I  
realized that I was reaching only about half of the class and that,  
while my (very oral) presentation style of presentation worked well  
for them, it wasn't working for the others.  That caused be to ask  
some good questions like: What other styles of teaching and learning  
are there? What do we know about the match of teacher styles of  
presentation and student styles of learning? Is it possible for a  
teacher to learn or strengthen other styles?  And so on.

I also remember that it was important to have a structured process,  
where the teaching/learning objectives were clear at the outset, and  
were a main reference point for the comments later.

Finally I remember thinking that this "slice of teaching" approach  
also had its limitations and wasn't representative of the actual ebb  
and flow of the classroom teaching process over time.

When we (the FOB editorial board and me) were working with Jessica to edit this article, I was surprised at how FEW of the editorial board members had used video in any professional development activities.

How about you, list members? Let us know if you HAVE or HAVE NOT been videoed, or HAVE or HAVE NOT used video as a professional development tool.

Hi Everyone,
Unfortunately I've never had the experience of being taped while 
teaching, but I have watched videos of other teachers in the 
process and the experience has been enlightening.  It directed my 
attention to my own ideological beliefs about teaching and 
learning.  What were my expectations of learners and how did those 
expectations connect with larger issues that impact teachers such 
as time constraints, and program goals(to mention only a few).
I think videotaping classes does give teachers 
an opportunity to have a more critical look at 
the impact of their teaching on learners, and similarly would give learners 
an opportunity to speak on behalf of their own learning experience which is
further reflection for teachers.  As part of the requirements for a english language teaching certificate program at the new school I will be required to videotape three of the classes I will be teaching this coming fall.  I'll keep you posted.
Esther Shupe

	Perspective
Message-ID: <s486b9ba.066@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I don't mean to interrupt the present discussion about video, but I do
want to give you a quick heads-up on next week's discussion:

Next week, June 12-16, Alisa Belzer will discuss two of her articles
from FOB.

Influences on the Reading Practices of Adults in ABE
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1108
      and
Learners on Learning to Read
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1110

The first article examines case studies of three learners and the
reading that they do outside of class to learn how this influences their
learning, and how teachers can encourage out-of-class reading. The
second describes a unique study where students were interviewed to give
their own assessment of what factors influenced their success in
learning how to read.

Please pass this on to anyone you know who may be interested in this
discussion. They can subscribe to the list at:

www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/focusonbasics

We'll post some discussion questions by Friday morning.

All the best,

Julie

Everyone,
I wanted to say a little more about the program that I am currently enrolled and the videotaping requirement.  THis is an online certificate program in English Language Teaching at The New School in NYC. THe nature of distance learning requires the aid of technology to make the program work and the videotaping of classroom instruction is purposeful in this regard.  The type of feedback I will get about the teaching and learning observations is unknown to me at this time, but I hope to have my own purpose in viewing the tapes.  Jessica's article and comments from the discussion will help me to ask the right questions.  I'll be sure to share my experience with the list.

On another note,  it's disheartening to me to read David's post and to know that the practice of videotaping classroom dynamics has been around for so long and yet is still not common practice for adult educators.  THe issues are at least in part about funding but also about the lack of connection that is experienced by many adult educators.  We for the most part are a team of volunteers or part-timers with very little power in determining, what if any PD is offered to us.  One of the continuing discussions about adult education is the way we are separate from other institutions of learning.  This in many ways gives us creative license but in many significant ways is disempowering.  What do others think?
Esther

All

Apologies for the delayed response - have been out of town.

We decided to tape as part of a three-year demonstration project (of sorts)
designed to assist ESOL teachers in integrating literacy into 'regular' ESOL
classes - as opposed to a pull-out model, which generally consisted of
having volunteers work on literacy with ESOL students one-on-one during
class time (and out of the classroom).

We were trying to find ways to incorporate strategies addressing literacy
for learners with roughly equivalent abilities with aural/oral language.
Part of that work including demonstration classes at the site, and part of
our documentation, initially, was through both written accounts and video
recording.  Once we began reviewing the tapes, we also saw their great
potential as professional development tools - both for those who are being
taped, as well as for others.  I've used the tapes (years later) with
university students who are working in literacy programs) as a means of
asking them to watch the tape, share observations, reflections and respond
to some guided questions about the teaching and learning they see.

Greetings,
While I concur with Esther's comments on the disconnectedness of adult 
educators and the barriers to sharing one's teaching or others' through 
video media, I have been thinking about the impact it has on people who have 
done it.  David  did it in the 60's and a couple more people who have 
participated in the discussion  mentioned videotaping themselves or others a 
long time ago and they still talk about it.  Or Janet who is using it in 
training.  To me, that was uplifting.  It is an experience that one never 
forgets and should be part of all teacher training programs.
It was a requirement in the TESL program at Portland State University 20 
years ago when I got my certificate but it no longer is. ( I still have the 
tape- no comment)
 A colleague of mine just made it a class requirement/ task for her students 
in a MA TESOL program at Oregon State University.
So... are there any paper FOB issues for this particular issue left? They 
could be sent to MA TESOL programs around the country and to state directors 
of Adult Basic Skills.  Just an idea...
Great conversation.  An eye opener and a way of being connected.

I've used video on my own evaluation and had students use it for theirs.
It is a useful tool and helps one be objective about what really happens
in a group.  We used to set the video up and leave it on regularly, then
review what we noticed as a group (students and instructors).  We found
it a useful tool for program improvement.

The only other Focus on Basics article that features videotaping that I can think of is by Reuel Kurzet, in Volume 5, Issue D (http://www.ncsall.net/?id=232). She writes about the NCSALL Lab School at Portland State's use of audio and video taping, and how looking together at a piece of tape gives folks a shared experience they can talk about.

Reuel emphasizes describing rather than judging what appears in a video of a classroom as an important first step.  What have other folks' experiences been: if you have seen yourself or your students in a video, what process do you use when viewing it?

That's a slightly different take on the discussion we've been having here: using classroom video together with a group.

Message-ID: <000e01c68a53$202b8700$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) and the National Center for the
Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) announce the "Adult Reading
Components Study (ARCS) Panel," a 30-minute video on NCSALL's ARCS research
produced by the Institute.  This video is available in streaming format and
can be viewed by going to:

 

http://www.nifl.gov/nifl/webcasts/20040204/webcast02-04.html 

 

ARCS was the first large-scale attempt to use a battery of individually
administered reading and language tests to describe the reading of students
enrolled in adult basic education (ABE) and English for speakers of other
languages (ESOL) programs. Nearly 1,000 adult learners from 30 learning
centers in seven states were assessed in order to develop instructionally
relevant cluster profiles of adult readers. 

 

The video offers a panel discussion about NCSALL's ARCS research and ways in
which programs can use the Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles, an
on-line assessment tool based on the ARCS research, to assess students and
plan instruction tailored to their specific profiles. Panel participants
are:

 

Dr. John Strucker - Researcher and ARCS Director, NCSALL

Dr. Rosalind Davidson - Researcher and ARCS Assistant Director, NCSALL

Kay Vaccaro - Program Assistant, Harris County, TX Department of Education,
Adult Education Division

Jane Meyer - Coordinator, ABLE-funded adult literacy project, Canton, OH

David J. Rosen (moderator) - Senior Associate, Newsome Associates, Boston,
MA

 

To visit the Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles ARCS Web site,
please go to: http://www.nifl.gov/readingprofiles/

To learn more about the ARCS, please see NCSALL's "Seminar Guide - Reading
Profiles" http://www.ncsall.net/?id=597 available from the CPPR section of
the NCSALL Web site. 

A NCSALL study circle guide on reading research and teaching materials on
reading are available from the Publications section of the NCSALL Web site:
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=25

The ARCS video panel introduction is also available free on DVD:

Order from NCSALL at http://www.ncsall.net/?id=24 for $5.00/copy (shipping
and handling), or send your request to NIFL at info at nifl.gov, and be sure to
include your mailing address.

 

The ARCS video is the first in a series of videos based on NCSALL research
that are being produced by the National Institute for Literacy.   As each
video is completed, streaming versions will be posted to the Web, with
accompanying announcements on the Institute's listservs and web sites and
NCSALL's Web site. Once the entire series is completed, all of the videos
will be packaged in a single DVD, which the Institute and NCSALL will make
available to the field.  The National Institute for Literacy and NCSALL
present these videos as introductions to key research topics in adult
learning and literacy.  We hope the field finds them useful as professional
and program development tools.

Virginia,

I'm glad you mentioned how students used video as a resource for 
themselves.  I remember observing a classroom that was doing a series of 
lessons around speaking and listening with a goal of preparing for work 
interviews.  The students really found video useful as an assessment for 
how well they performed.

Aaron and others,

I would like to see our field have a large digital video collection  
of excellent examples of teaching.  These "learning objects," or  
relatively short classroom digital video clips, could demonstrate for  
example: a teaching approach, technique, or method; a way of  
organizing a classroom; a way to integrate technology; or a way to  
use certain materials. Each clip could be linked to a widely agreed- 
upon teaching quality standard.  It should be online, accessible free  
to teachers anytime, anywhere, and also to those who could use them  
in their online or face-to-face professional development courses or  
workshops.

Some examples of this exist in the area of integrating technology in  
the classroom.  In our field this began several years ago with the  
very well done, and still relevant "Captured Wisdom" project by Lynda  
Ginsburg, Jennifer Elmore and others [ http://www.ncrtec.org/pd/cw/ 
adultlit.htm ] . Current good work is being done in California by  
Marian Thacher and others at OTAN [ http://www.otan.us/Itap/index.cfm? 
fuseaction=videogallery ]. These are short classroom examples of  
teachers and students integrating technology well.  I  have learned a  
lot about how to integrate technology well from both Captured Wisdom  
and OTAN instructional Technology Assistance Project  videos.

There are also examples of digital videos on line from the Portland,  
Oregon National Labsite for Adult ESOL [http://www.labschool.pdx.edu/ 
video_demo.html ] , a FOB article on this at [ http://www.ncsall.net/? 
id=987 ] and an archived discussion which began on this list in  
February, 2006
[ http://www.nifl.gov/pipermail/focusonbasics/2006/000157.html ].

Are there other online digital video examples of good adult education  
teaching?

I think we need a major, multiyear national project to build an  
online digital searchable database of "standards-based" examples of  
good teaching. Would this be useful to you as a teacher, tutor,  
administrator, or professional developer?  If so, what would you like  
to see in this database?

Hi-
I'm thinking- in response to Esther & Dominique's comments on the
disconnectedness of adult educators- tt this is an issue within schools as
well as across the field that can be addressed by using video. One of the
teachers I interviewed pointed out that two willing teachers could easily
video each other and then sit around and discuss their classes - that this
is essentially free and effective for improving one's teaching (in his
experience). I think in k-12 schools it is often a mentor & novice teacher
who pair up to do this, but is seems like it would work the best with peers.
I heard a lot from the teachers I interviewed about the importance to them
of not being judged or evaluated - of course they meant by researchers, but
I suspect the lack of evaluation left them as open as they were to seeing
their classrooms from a new perspective. I guess I'm thinking about two
things - first of all video as a way of connecting p/t teachers (perhaps)
who wouldn't have a chance to cross paths or really work together. what do
you think? also, how important is the type of discussion and the level of
judgement? is it better to focus on students, is it better to really analyze
one's own teaching directly, or does self-conciousness then get in the way
and ruin the process? i know there are probably many different answers to
this question, but while we're rolling with this as a pd tool, i'm wondering
if there is a generally good way to use it - guidelines, perhaps, based on
everyone's experiences...

Greetings, 

We are working here in South Dakota to strengthen our teacher training
and ongoing professional development system.  One tool that we have
looked at is video-taping.  Some of us feel this would be an extremely
useful tool, especially given the distances between our centers and the
travel, time and funding barriers that arise to many other PD options,
like peer observation.  

We do feel, however, that there would be a great deal of resistance to
using video taping by many of our teachers.  

Does anyone have any ideas on how to overcome this negative perception
of using video-taping as a PD tool?  

Thank you.

I think an archive could be useful and it would be great if it were
interactive. Looking at how the videos are uploaded to "You Tube" might
be helpful. Once a video is up at that site anybody that watches the
video can do three things. 

1. Give it a grade (not so useful in this case, maybe, because the
videos would probably be vetted to begin with)

2. Post a comment (and the comments are available for other people to
read and react to)

3. Tag the video with codes (e.g., Nirvana, grunge, Seattle). This code
helps people when they are searching through the 40,000 videos uploaded
to You Tube daily. 

The coding and comments could work together in a really instructive way.
For example, I could watch a video clip and tag it with a code - say,
teacher participation in pair work (a NCSALL study). I think this would
be helpful because any given clip of teaching could be used for many
type of examples (look at what the teacher is doing in terms of body
language, look at how the students are working together, what are the
materials used, etc.) I think having this flexibility would add to the
way people would use the resource. Yes, of course, you should be able to
search by standards and video clips to be attached to standards (i.e.,
here is an example of what has been defined as a best practice), but we
should also take advantage of the communal productive aspect of the
internet and allow for more democratic development of what is called
best practice.  

It would be even better if we could connect the comment section to the
code. So I could look at a clip that has gotten multiple codes - pair
work, intermediate ESL, present perfect progressive - and then click on
a comment section connected to one of those codes. This would help
organize the asynchronous conversation around the multiple topics the
clip would speak to.

Here are six suggestions:

1. Use videotaping in the context of a peer coaching model where two  
teachers from the same center (or if there is one, a nearby center)  
are paired, and use a structured process to help each other to  
improve their teaching.
2. Provide the equipment -- and training on how to use it --  
including the technical aspects, free.
3. Provide teachers with paid professional development time to do a  
peer-coaching project.
4. Make it clear that this is not part of their performance evaluation.
5. Provide articles (and videotapes?) on the process which they can  
look at before they decide whether or not to try it.
6. Let teachers know that you will provide a stipend and travel  
expenses for a (selected) pair of teachers who want to present their  
peer coaching project at a state, regional or national conference.

David mentioned a video collection for the field, and referenced, among
others, the Lab School in Portland, where they actually do have huge
collection of videos that can be accessed for research use, and probably
for PD efforts as well. Dominique, and/or anyone else from the Lab
School, can you tell us more about how this works with the video
collection? How can programs from around the country access this
collection? It seems like a very unique, and possibly underused
resource!

Read more about the lab school and their use of video in Volume 8A of
FOB:

The Lab School
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=987

This issue also has several articles about how teachers used the videos
for research in ESOL learning.

Aaron and others,

I would like to see our field have a large digital video collection  
of excellent examples of teaching.  These "learning objects," or  
relatively short classroom digital video clips, could demonstrate for  
example: a teaching approach, technique, or method; a way of  
organizing a classroom; a way to integrate technology; or a way to  
use certain materials. Each clip could be linked to a widely agreed- 
upon teaching quality standard.  It should be online, accessible free  
to teachers anytime, anywhere, and also to those who could use them  
in their online or face-to-face professional development courses or  
workshops.

Some examples of this exist in the area of integrating technology in  
the classroom.  In our field this began several years ago with the  
very well done, and still relevant "Captured Wisdom" project by Lynda  
Ginsburg, Jennifer Elmore and others [ http://www.ncrtec.org/pd/cw/ 
adultlit.htm ] . Current good work is being done in California by  
Marian Thacher and others at OTAN [ http://www.otan.us/Itap/index.cfm? 
fuseaction=videogallery ]. These are short classroom examples of  
teachers and students integrating technology well.  I  have learned a  
lot about how to integrate technology well from both Captured Wisdom  
and OTAN instructional Technology Assistance Project  videos.

There are also examples of digital videos on line from the Portland,  
Oregon National Labsite for Adult ESOL [http://www.labschool.pdx.edu/ 
video_demo.html ] , a FOB article on this at [ http://www.ncsall.net/? 
id=987 ] and an archived discussion which began on this list in  
February, 2006
[ http://www.nifl.gov/pipermail/focusonbasics/2006/000157.html ].

Are there other online digital video examples of good adult education  
teaching?

I think we need a major, multiyear national project to build an  
online digital searchable database of "standards-based" examples of  
good teaching. Would this be useful to you as a teacher, tutor,  
administrator, or professional developer?  If so, what would you like  
to see in this database?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 330] Discussion Questions for June 12 Discussion:
	Reading from the	Learner's Perspective
Message-ID: <s4897e6a.095@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

Here are some discussion questions to think about for next week's
discussion with Alisa Belzer: Reading from the Learners Perspective:

Note that there are two different articles that we will discuss.

Influences on the Reading Practices of Adults in ABE
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1108

1. Have you ever evaluated how much reading your students do outside of
class time? If so, what were the results? What factors in their life do
you think affect how much outside reading they do?
2. According to the article, a learner's own belief in the value of
reading as a learning tool is important, as is family support, time to
read, and access to print materials at home. What can we do as teachers
to help those students who lack these factors? What program support
could help?


Learners on Learning to Read
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1110

1. What do you think of this reseacrch practice of asking the learners
themselves for input about effective teaching/learning strategies?
2. According to the learners, the following factors were cited as the
most important for successful reading development: "1) their own
motivation and determination, 2) program features, including
relationships with an instructor, instructional strategies and
materials, and structures and formats, 3) reading practice, and 4)
supports." How much do you agree or disagree, based on your own sense?
Reflect on these factors in your own classes and programs. How could
they be improved?

Message-ID: <20060609181512.33293CA0BF@ws7-4.us4.outblaze.com>

Jessica and all,
Yes I agree, I think that videotaping could help teachers to connect, especially those of us who are on the periphery. 

Just a few thoughts on the uses of videotaping as PD for adult educators:
If you look at videotaping as a means of critical reflection, it could help raise the consciousness of teachers, helping them better identify and challenge the assumptions that drive their teaching practices.  For example, one goal might be toward a ?critical teaching? approach (I think coined by Shor).  One important goal of this approach is to begin to look at how teachers can help students to think more critically about their learning.  Videotaping the classroom dynamics could be of both the student and the teacher and the reflection part could take various different forms. One focus might be on the methodological practices that strengthen or weaken learner?s ability to think and act creatively in the classroom.  Many types of reflective questions in this area are already out there and available to use.

I can say from experience that many learners come to the classroom with preconceived notions about ?learning? developed from their K-12 experience.  The same is true of teachers.  Because many teachers working with adult learners are unaware of the different aspects of adult learner motivation, many lack the skills to approach teaching in a way from would facilitate greater insight for their adult learners.  

Visual aids are always a powerful tool in helping to to uncover hidden dynamics at work, As a result, helping teachers to create a more meaningful learning environment for their learners.  I know this would be a huge undertaking (money and time commitment on the part of the institution, teacher and student) further it would require that teachers be onboard in terms of being open to changing the way they approach teaching and learning, but I think it would be worth the effort and I know that I would be highly motivated to participate in this type of PD.
Esther

Message-ID: <s48a95d5.048@mail.jsi.com>

Jessica, and everyone who contributed to this discussion,

Thank you! It was enriching to hear the idea of using video as a
professional development tool examined as closely and thoughtfully as
you have all done. 

You have documented a variety of benefits for teachers, both experienced
and new, and learners that can come from watching videos. You also
shared many suggestions, including:

- focus on the students and their behavior, both in filming and
reviewing
- have students also review the videos and comment
- don't be videotaped too many times
- use videos for students to evaluate themselves
- describe rather than judge when viewing videos
- use as a way to connect part-time teachers 
- use in study circles
- use for peer coaching
- develop and use a video database for our field

There is too much to summarize here, but I encourage you to look back at
the discussion to recall the points that resonate with you, and
hopefully some of you can further discuss this method of professional
development within your programs. You can find the discussion on the
Literacy Tent ALE Wiki at the following link:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Video_as_a_Professional_Development_Tool

By the way, you can find many other useful resources and discussions on
this Wiki! The home page is at:

Again Everyone, thanks for a great discussion! (And rest up--another one
starts on Monday!)

All the Best,

Julie

Hi Everyone,

I am passing on this response that I received from someone who asked me
to post it for them. It speaks to the question of getting feedback
directly from learners on the process of their learning.

Julie

***************************************
Julie -- I posed your questions to some practitioners here in Ohio--one 
answered me promptly.   Here are her thoughts about asking adults about 
their thoughts about teaching strategies and practices.  I think these 
would be interesting for the discussion list.   Robin Schwarz

Dear Robin,

I  just came across some materials I had when I taught GED classes in
2001. I initially asked students to fill out information about their
likes, dislikes, favorite hobbies, what they wanted to learn the first
week I started.
I was a brand new teacher for this population. ( I taught basic
English/ESL previously). I tried hard to learn their names and get to
know them as the wonder unique individuals they were/are.

I have to admit it was hard for me because I had to teach math
( not my best subject) and reading for levels 2nd to 9th grade in one
class. Learning the computer software was a challenge because of
starting as a teacher in the 2nd week of classes.

It was fortunate that I had a wonderful mentor to help me with the
class. I tried with a variety learning approaches: video, discussion,
hands-on. We had a set curricula to cover but I gave students learning
styles inventories in order to try to individualize my teaching
approaches with them. I also worked w/ those who asked/ I asked if they
need help on a one/one basis.

Midterm I asked students to evaluate what activities they liked the
best: working on the computer, class discussions, specific learning
modules I'd taught. I also asked what subjects they felt they still
needed help with.

I found they loved talking about math.. and liked reading/discussion
exercises involving music artists like George Benson and Ray Charles.
They also liked working on the computer re: Reading.

It was not "scientific" to me but maybe in reality it was...


In our society we ask "consumers" what they think of "products".
In research....WHy don't we ask adult learners what they want, need,
feel?

I think it's partially because of the barriers to writing and for ESL
students spoken language. However, I think this is not that hard to
address if our society is finally willing to reach out to people that
need education.

Re: student motivation....
One other major issue that we are addressing in our GED program is
identifying/eliminating barriers to attendance for adults. Poverty, no
food, no job, caring for families, childcare-especially for
infants,drug/alcohol problems, violence, unsupportive families, friends,
transportation,mental illnesses, domestic violence are all major issues.

In light of Time magazine's article on "Dropout Nation" and the growing
undereducated population it is very important that we ask our students
what they need, address their concerns and partner with research/policy
makers to help all our members of our society.

Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.2.20060613212057.03a91918@rci.rutgers.edu>

Hello Everyone:

I'm very curious to know your reactions to this work.  As I was doing the 
research I found the learners words to be very compelling, heartfelt, well 
articulated, and interesting.  However, when I went to analyze the data, I 
wondered if their perceptions really shed light on the big questions of the 
day regarding teaching developing adult readers to read better.  I asked 
myself whether they gave me information that was new.  I guess two things 
really emerged for me.  One, that it was important to them that they be 
taught some technical skills and be given lots of opportunities to read 
interesting materials over extended periods of time (it seems like we have 
a tendency to emphasize one or the other depending on our own beliefs, but 
balance seems to be the key), and two, that they focused the discussion 
differently than teachers or researchers might do  Their focus makes clear 
that the starting place for success is within them.  It's not clear to me 
if teachers can create those conditions for learners or if they have to 
find a way to do it themselves.

Anyway, I'll be interested to know how this all strikes you.

Alisa

I found this study very interesting to work on.  In some ways it raised 
more questions than it answered.  One thing I wonder about is how this 
picture might all change for learners who have teachers who have found 
concrete ways to encourage extensive practice outside of class, and who 
have exposed their students both to lots of interesting texts and to 
strategies for reading independently (e.g., how to pick reading materials, 
what to do when stuck etc.).   The learners in this study hadn't gotten 
those kinds of supports and encouragements, but how does practice outside 
of class look different when they have?

Also, I think this study raises interesting questions regarding how to help 
adult learners make learning opportunities out of the day to day 
interactions with text that most adults take part in to some extent, 
regardless of reading level every day.  In other words, even low level 
readers have found ways to navigate their lives in our text bound 
culture.  Yet, these interactions don't necessarily help them improve their 
reading, maybe because the have found ways to "manage" without really 
actually reading very much.  How can these day to day, adult interactions 
with text that almost everyone has to deal with (signs, labels, etc.), 
actually be turned into explicit opportunities to practice?  Does it always 
have to be book reading?

In my work in India, learners told me that they now
could read what they wanted to which included:

1. Road and other signs including bus numbers
2. The newspaper occasionally, especially around
election time
3. Notes sent from school.
4. Film magazines
5. Religious texts (all faiths stated that)

When I asked them if they would use a mobile library
or do extra reading, I was told:

1. They had very little time
2. They preferred to watch the telly or listen to the
radio
3. They did not feel the necessity
4. Told me they didn't want to turn into memsahibs of
leisure, which is how they saw people who 'sat around
and read'.... pretensions of intellectuality

A few asked me if reading beyond what they needed to
negotiate their lives, was a goal I had for them. And
yet, they used reading more than they did writing.

The last question threw me....

Everyone,
I concur with Ujwala that learners are eager and motivated to read if what they are reading is connected to their lives in a meaningful way. (And we as instructors learn quickly that learners get to define what is meaningful). 

On another note, I have been working with John for the past two years.  He graduated from a high school in New Jersey in 1972 through the special education department. When we met, John could not read.  Not at any level.  He lacked the concept of phoneme awareness, so we needed to start from the beginning. What was striking to me about John was the way he perceived himself as a learner.  He felt he couldn't do anything related to reading on his own.  As a way to uncover some "hidden" patterns at work for him we decided to write his "learner biography".  The story was incredible, very emotional.  Year after year in school his experience would be the same.  Because of his quiet nature, he would very often be ignored by teachers who were clearly overwhelmed by the needier students in the class.  Unfortunately the same pattern persisted at home.  He was one of nine children in his family.  He rarely came home with his books and almost never was given homework.  He said he never got the help he needed at home,, so he never did his homework. The teachers relented and stopped giving him take home work.   Two important themes emerged from this writing.  THe first was the need for John to create the space and time to ask questions and express concerns regarding his learning.  The second was for John to have more independence in his work at home.  Sort of an equilibrium if you will, between asking for help and learning strategies to work on your own. These two discoveries have enabled John to be more active in his own learning.  We are still a long way from the goals he has set for himself, but reflecting on his past experiences as a learner has allowed him to see more clearly alternative ways to approach learning as an adult.

Absolutely! the women I worked with had to create a
safe space and time to ask questions and for help.
This is one of reasons for the failure of an
international campaign with a very catchy name "Each
one teach one" <sic> in India, where children (some as
young as 6/7) were to teach illiterate adults. Women
did not feel safe, and were afraid of being ridiculed
by children and hence the campaign sputtered along
until structures and training were added. Working with
small groups of women helped them with their
self-confidence and they said they did not feel quite
so foolish asking for help or making mistakes.

You've put it well. It must be very rewarding for
John!

Very nice. Now can you share teaching strategies? Stroking, space,
solicitude for  learning must be supported by a structured systematic method
to teach the language.  Are the tutors totally prepared?  Lucille Cuttler

Everyone,
I concur with Ujwala that learners are eager and motivated to read if what
they are reading is connected to their lives in a meaningful way. (And we as
instructors learn quickly that learners get to define what is meaningful).

On another note, I have been working with John for the past two years.  He
graduated from a high school in New Jersey in 1972 through the special
education department. When we met, John could not read.  Not at any level.
He lacked the concept of phoneme awareness, so we needed to start from the
beginning. What was striking to me about John was the way he perceived
himself as a learner.  He felt he couldn't do anything related to reading on
his own.  As a way to uncover some "hidden" patterns at work for him we
decided to write his "learner biography".  The story was incredible, very
emotional.  Year after year in school his experience would be the same.
Because of his quiet nature, he would very often be ignored by teachers who
were clearly overwhelmed by the needier students in the class.
Unfortunately the same pattern persisted at home.  He was one of nine
children in his family.  He rarely came home with his books and almost never
was given homework.  He said he never g
 ot the help he needed at home,, so he never did his homework. The teachers
relented and stopped giving him take home work.   Two important themes
emerged from this writing.  THe first was the need for John to create the
space and time to ask questions and express concerns regarding his learning.
The second was for John to have more independence in his work at home.  Sort
of an equilibrium if you will, between asking for help and learning
strategies to work on your own. These two discoveries have enabled John to
be more active in his own learning.  We are still a long way from the goals
he has set for himself, but reflecting on his past experiences as a learner
has allowed him to see more clearly alternative ways to approach learning as
an adult.

Yes, I agree. Emotional support and sensitivity to a learner's  
specific needs are important. But an overemphasis on this perspective  
can be detrimental to a student learning to become an independent  
reader. Many years ago I was a volunteer literacy tutor. Almost all  
of my training was in the area of making the student feel comfortable  
and safe, finding out what his interests were, and selecting reading  
materials that matched his interests, etc. I felt overwhelmed because  
in essence the volunteer tutor organization put all of the onus of  
finding suitable material for instruction on me. They expected me to  
find materials  that were meaningful to the student. But instruction  
on how to teach the nuts and bolts of basic reading skills was  
lacking. My student and I over time became friends, but I never felt  
I made much impact on his ability to improve as a reader. Really  
after two years I felt like I had wasted both his time and mine. Now  
thirty years later and after working as a remedial reading teacher at  
an inner-city high school and operating my own reading clinic and  
developing my own research-based program, I realize that if students  
are ever to become independent readers, they must be taught the  
specific skill strands identified by the National Reading Panel in  
their report Teaching Children to Read: phonemic awareness, phonics,  
fluency, and comprehension. There are some good, research-based  
programs for adults that focus on these skill strands. It is too much  
to ask tutors to go out and reinvent the wheel. But at least we now  
have empirical data which informs us as to how best focus our  
precious time when we are teaching.

Hi Everyone,

Please excuse the interruption from the current discussion. I just want to tell you about two discussions next week on other Discussion Lists:

June 19-23 on the Health Literacy List: Using the Health Literacy Study Circles+
Please see the following link for more information:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Health_Literacy#Discussions

June 10-23 on the Assessment List: 
Please see below for more information.

All the Best,

*******************************
June 19 * 23, 2006
 
Topic:  Assessment in Mathematics 
 
Guest:  Myrna Manly * please see Myrna's bio below.
 
Myrna will respond to your email posts once per day * feel free to send your post to the Assessment Discussion List, or to me so that I can post it for you (marie.cora at hotspurpartners.com).
 
Bio

Myrna Manly, a mathematics teacher with experience at many academic levels, retired in 2001 from a position as professor of mathematics at El Camino College.  In addition to instruction, she has been involved with the assessment of the mathematics proficiency of adults in various roles: as the Mathematics Specialist for the 1988 version of the GED test; as a member of the numeracy team for the Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (ALL); and as the numeracy consultant for a similar international survey to be used in developing countries, the Literacy Assessment and Monitoring Programme (LAMP). She is the Past President of the Adult Numeracy Network (ANN), is the author of The GED Math Problem Solver, and also works with states and programs facilitating staff-development workshops aimed at improving mathematics instruction to adults. 

Myrna is presently writing a paper with Mary Jane Schmidt and Lynda Ginsburg on the components of numeracy for NCSALL (National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy). The paper reviews the literature, describes the fundamental elements of adult numeracy, and makes recommendations for further research, particularly with respect to curriculum and assessment.  Look for this resource soon from NCSALL.

 
Recommended preparations for this discussion
 
Myrna has provided several questions below to get you thinking about math assessment:
 
It is known that students and teachers come to value what is assessed.  What is your opinion of the influence that the standardized mathematics assessments (GED, TABE, CASAS) have in your classrooms? Are they assessing the mathematics that is important for the 21st century? Do you think that they all assess the same mathematics? What do you think is missing from each? 

Computation skills are easy to assess.  How can we assess other important aspects of mathematics like strategic problem solving, conceptual understanding, and reasoning? 
 
Describe instances where you have seen a student's "math anxiety" interfere with an accurate assessment of his/her abilities. Do you assess math anxiety in any way? What strategies have you used to reduce it? Any luck with them? 
 
Which classroom techniques do you recommend for informal, ongoing assessment of a student's progress in learning mathematics? 
 
In addition to the above questions to stimulate discussion, Myrna has provided these sites for math assessment.  Please take a look at these sites and post your questions and comments to the Discussion:

http://www.literacy.org/products/ncal/pdf/TR9805.pdf  Assessing Mathematical Knowledge of Adult Learners: Are We Looking at What Counts? This technical report from NCAL was written by Joy Cumming, Iddo Gal, and Lynda Ginsburg in 1998.  It discusses assessment principles and evaluates their implementation in common numeracy assessment tools.

http://www.ncsall.net/?id=573 The Inclusion of Numeracy in Adult Basic Education, Dave Tout and Mary Jane Schmitt, 2002.  This chapter from NCSALL's annual review contains a section on assessment that includes a description of assessments in adult education from Australia and The Netherlands. 

http://www.nctm.org/news/assessment/2005_12nb.htm Will This Be on the Test? This article discusses the importance of including significant mathematics on tests.  It includes a good example of a test item that goes beyond procedural skills.

Everyone,
I think in the telling of my experience with John, some concern has been raised in the area of "skills" instruction.  Of course, I agree that new adult readers must be taught skills that can help them to achieve success in reading.  The significance in this story, at least for me, is how ineffective patterns of learning established in early years can distinguish or severly limit one's ability to learn as an adult.  Making those patterns more accessable (through learner biographies) can facilitate greater more meaningful learning experiences.  In this case we are talking about "reading" but this is true for all learning experiences.

Hello Rochelle,

Thanks for raising this issue.  I'm cross-posting to FocusOnBasics, because 
of a thread on learners views, and copying to Alan Wells at the UK Basic 
Skills Agency, mentioned in my postscript.

In the text you quote in your email, Tom Sticht discusses why many people 
believe that adults can't learn to read, and suggests it is because people 
tend to put nature before nurture.  But he does not consider that poor 
literacy of adults may be due to poor teaching of those adults as children. 
This is a very strong argument towards nurture!  Let me elaborate.

There is an underlying assumption that learning to read is difficult, and 
that many people with LD or dyslexia cannot be taught to read.  But the 
experience of the Clackmannanshire study was that 100% of school children in 
a deprived area of Scotland could be taught to read, given the right 
teaching method.  Is there any logical argument why adults could not all be 
taught to read by the same method - synthetic phonics?

The idea that you can "mix and match" methods according to the "learning 
style" of children, putting them in the right "learning environment" and 
addressing their "psychological needs", has been a failure, and now, after 
decades of failed teaching, we have one in five adults (in UK, US, Canada..) 
unable to read satisfactorily, costing the economy around 1% GDP.

What is more, when asked about their reading problems, the adults blame 
themselves!  To quote from another NIFL message (see FocusOnBasics 337 
learners on learning to read):  "Their focus makes clear that the starting 
place for success is within them."

So I'd reinforce Tom's message - keep on at the teaching.  But I would like 
to see a study on whether synthetic phonics works as well for adults, as it 
appears to do for kids.

Cheers,

John

P.S.  There has been some doubt on the merit of synthetic phonics (where 
segmentation and blending is done with individual phonemes) over other 
phonics methods.  In particular a paper by Torgerson et al. threw doubt on 
the supremecy of synthetic phonics over analytic phonics and other methods. 
This has raised doubts for others, such as the Basic Skills Agency in the 
UK, see:
 http://www.basic-skills.co.uk/site/page.php?cms=2&p=1723.

But the Torgerson document has been convincingly rebuffed by Diane 
McGuinness, see http://www.rrf.org.uk/Torgersonarticle.pdf, to quote:

"This is a dense document, with numerous tables and appendices, arcane 
discussions of statistical minutiae and issues regarding experimental 
design, etc., all to the end (it appears) of drawing a vague set of 
conclusions which lead the reader to believe that synthetic phonics 
programmes have not been proven to be effective beyond other methods by any 
margin sufficient to be trustworthy. The reality is, that every statement 
under the heading key findings is incorrect or seriously compromised by the 
true facts."

and later...

"When the results for onset-rime/analogy based phonics programmes were 
compared to those for phoneme-based synthetic phonics instruction, there was 
another parting of the ways. Rime/analogy programmes were singularly 
unsuccessful, producing an effect size of .28. The pooled data for the 
phoneme-based programmes on their own produced an effect-size shot of around 
1.0 (one-standard deviation advantage over the comparison groups). This 
effect is very large, and it is reliable."

Theoretically You Can?t Teach Adults to Read and Write:
But Just Keep On Doing It

Tom Sticht
International Consultant in Adult Education

Why is it so hard to get funding for adult literacy education? Innumerable
studies, reports, TV shows, and statistical surveys in most of the
industrialized nations of the world declare that their nation is being
brought to its economic knees because of widespread low basic skills
(literacy, numeracy) amongst the adult population. But repeated calls for 
funding commensurate with the size of the problem go unanswered. Why?

Beneath the popular pronouncements of educators, industry leaders, and 
government officials about the importance of adult basic skills development 
there flows an undercurrent of disbelief about the abilities of illiterates 
or the poorly literate to ever improve much above their present learning. 
This was encountered close to a hundred years ago when Cora Wilson Stewart 
started the Moonlight Schools of Kentucky in 1911. Her claim that adults 
could learn to read and write met with skepticism. As she reported, Quote: 
"Some educators, however, declared preposterous the claims we made that 
grown people were learning to read and write. It was contrary to the 
principles of psychology, they said."   End Quote

Today that undercurrent of disbelief still flows, but today it carries with
it the flotsam and jetsam of "scientific facts" from genetics science,
brain science, and psychological science. Look here at objects snatched
from the undercurrent of disbelief stretching back for just a decade and a
half.

2006. Ann Coulter is a major voice in the conservative political arena. In
her new book, Godless: The Church of Liberalism (Chapter 7 The Left?s War on 
Science: Burning Books to Advance "Science" pages 172-174)  she clearly 
defends the ideas given in Murray & Hernstein?s book The Bell Curve 
regarding the genetic basis of intelligence. By extension,  since The Bell 
Curve uses reading and math tests in the Armed Forces Qualification Test 
(AFQT), Coulter is discussing the genetic basis of literacy and numeracy. In 
her book she says about The Bell Curve book:

Quote: "Contrary to the party line denying that such a thing as IQ existed, 
the book methodically demonstrated that IQ exists, it is easily measured, it 
is heritable, and it is extremely important. ?Among many other things, IQ is 
a better predictor than socioeconomic status of poverty, unemployment, 
criminality, divorce, single motherhood, workplace injuries, and high school 
dropout rates.  ?Although other factors influence IQ, such as a good 
environment and nutrition, The Bell Curve authors estimated that IQ was 
about 40 to 80 percent genetic." (p. 173) End Quote

Coulter goes on to discuss the misuse of science in the same chapter in
relation to AIDS and homosexuality, feminism, trial-lawyers law suits, DDT 
and environmentalists, abortion and stem cell research, and other topics 
that are controversial among large segments of the population but of 
mainstream concern in the far right conservative base in the United States. 
Because of her position as a best-selling author and spokesperson for 
conservative groups, Ann Coulter?s ideas about the genetic basis of 
intelligence and high school dropouts can have a profound impact upon 
political thinking about basic skills education among adults who have not 
achieved well.

2005. The Nobel Prize winning economist James J. Heckman  in an interview at 
the Federal Reserve Bank region in Chicago discussed his ideas about 
cognitive skills and their malleability in later life with  members of a 
presidential commission consisting of  former U.S. senators, heads of 
federal agencies, tax attorneys and academic economists. Later in his 
interview he discusses what Adam Smith, in his The Wealth of Nations said 
and why he, Heckman, disagrees with Smith.

According to Heckman, Adam Smith said, Quote: "? people are basically born 
the same and at age 8 one can't really see much difference among them. But 
then starting at age 8, 9, 10, they pursue different fields, they
specialize and they diverge. In his mind, the butcher and the lawyer and
the journalist and the professor and the mechanic, all are basically the
same person at age 8." End Quote Heckman disagrees with this and says:

Quote: This is wrong. IQ is basically formed by age 8, and there are huge
differences in IQ among people. Smith was right that people specialize
after 8, but they started specializing before 8. On the early formation of
human skill, I think Smith was wrong, although he was right about many
other things. ? I think these observations on human skill formation are 
exactly why the job training programs aren't working in the United States 
and why many remediation programs directed toward disadvantaged young adults 
are so ineffective. And that's why the distinction between cognitive and 
noncognitive skill is so important, because a lot of the problem with 
children from disadvantaged homes is their values, attitudes and 
motivations. ?Cognitive skills such as IQ can't really be changed much after 
ages 8 to 10. But with noncognitive skills there's much more malleability. 
That's the point I was making earlier when talking about the prefrontal 
cortex. It remains fluid and adaptable until the early 20s. That's why 
adolescent mentoring programs are as effective as they are. Take a 
13-year-old. You're not going to raise the IQ of a 13-year-old, but you can 
talk the 13-year-old out of dropping out of school. Up to a point you can 
provide surrogate parenting. End Quote

Here Heckman seems to think of the IQ as something relatively fixed at an 
early age and not likely to be changed later in life. But if IQ is measured 
in The Bell Curve, a book in which Heckman found some merit, using the AFQT, 
which in turn is a literacy and numeracy test, then this would imply that 
Heckman thinks the latter may not be very malleable in later life. This 
seems consistent with his belief that remediation programs for adults are 
ineffective and do not make very wise investments.

2000. It is easy to slip from talking about adults with low literacy ability
to talking about adults with low intelligence. On October 2, 2000, Dan
Seligman, columnist at Forbes magazine, wrote about the findings of the
National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) of 1993 and said, Quote: "But note
that what?s being measured here is not what you?ve been thinking all your 
life as "literacy." The cluster of abilities being examined is obviously a 
proxy for plain old "intelligence." End Quote He then goes on to argue that 
government programs won?t do much about this problem of low intelligence, 
and, by extension, of low literacy.

These types of popular press articles can stymie funding for adult literacy 
education. That is one reason why it is critical that when national
assessments of cognitive skills, including literacy, are administered, we
need to be certain about just what it is we are measuring. Unfortunately, 
that is not the case with the 1993 NALS or the more recent 2003 National 
Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL). These assessments leave open the 
possibility of being called "intelligence" tests leading some, like 
Seligman, to the general conclusion that the less literate are simply the 
less intelligent and society might as well cast them off ? their 
"intelligence genes" will not permit them to ever reach Level 3 or any other 
levels at the high end of cognitive tests.

1998.  Dr. G. Reid L yon of the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development provided an Overview of Reading and Literacy Initiatives to the 
U. S. Congress Committee on Labor and Human Resources on April 28, 1998. In 
his testimony he stated that in learning to read it is important for 
children to possess good abilities in phonemic analysis. He stated:

Quote: Difficulties in developing phoneme awareness can have genetic and 
neurobiological origins or can be attributable to a lack of exposure to
language patterns and usage during the preschool years?. It is for this
reason that the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(NICHD) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) considers reading 
failure to reflect not only an educational problem, but a significant public 
health problem as well. Within this context, a large research network 
consisting of 41 research sites in North America, Europe, and Asia are 
working hard to identify (1) the critical environmental, experiential, 
cognitive, genetic, neurobiological, and instructional conditions that 
foster strong reading development; (2) the risk factors that predispose 
youngsters to reading failure; and (3) the instructional procedures that can 
be applied to ameliorate reading deficits at the earliest possible time. End 
Quote

Discussing why some children may have difficulties learning to read, Lyon 
went on to say:

Quote: Children raised in poverty, youngsters with limited proficiency in
English, children with speech and hearing impairments, and children from 
homes where the parent's reading levels are low are relatively predisposed 
to reading failure. Likewise, youngsters with sub-average intellectual 
capabilities have difficulties learning to read, particularly in the reading 
comprehension domain. End Quote

Taken together, these statements by a senior government scientist advisor to 
both the President and the Congress of the United States indicates that the 
NICHD considers that in some cases low literacy may result from genetic, 
neurological, sub-average intellectual capability or a combination of these 
and other factors. Again, this may contribute to widespread beliefs that 
adults with low literacy may possess faulty genes, brains, and/or 
intellectual abilities and are unlikely to benefit from adult literacy 
education programs. From a policy perspective, then, policymakers may think 
that funding such programs may be regarded as a poor use of public funds.

1997. In a January 7, 1997 article in the Washington Times, a prominent
newspaper published in Washington, DC and read by many members of Congress, 
columnist Ken Adelman wrote:

Quotes: The age-old nature vs. nurture debate assumes immediacy as the new 
Congress and new administration gin up to address such issues as poverty, 
crime, drugs, etc. ?This, the most intellectually intriguing debate around, 
is moving far toward nature (and far from nurture) with new evidence 
presented by an odd pair - gay activist Chandler Burr and conservative 
scholar Charles Murray. ?In brief, their new findings show that 1) 
homosexuality and 2) educational-economic achievement are each largely a 
matter of genes ? not of upbringing. ?If true, as appears so, the scope of 
effective government programs narrows. Fate, working through chromosomes, 
bestows both sexual orientation and brainpower, which shape one's life and 
success. Little can be altered - besides fostering tolerance and helping in 
any narrow window left open - through even an ideally designed public 
program.   (page B-6) End Quotes

The juxtaposition of homosexuals and those of lower educational and economic 
achievement is an obvious rhetorical device meant to stir negative emotions 
about both groups, This is a rhetorical device brought back into play by 
Coulter in her 2006 book cited above.

1991. One of the beliefs in our culture is that the brain and its 
intellectual  capacity  is   developed   in   early   childhood. There is a
widespread belief that if children's early childhood development  is not
properly stimulated, then there is likely to be intellectual 
underdevelopment leading to academic  failures, low aptitude, and social 
problems such as criminal activity, teenage pregnancy and welfare. It will 
be difficult if not impossible to overcome the disadvantages of deficiencies 
in early childhood stimulation later in adulthood. So why invest much in 
adult education? We need instead to put billions of dollars into early 
childhood education.

That these beliefs about the consequence of early childhood development are 
widespread is revealed by articles written by prominent journalists in major 
newspapers. For instance, on Sunday, October 13, 1991 the San Diego Union 
newspaper reprinted an article by Joan Beck, a columnist for the Chicago 
Tribune , that  argued  for  early  childhood education because, Quote: 
"Half of adult intellectual capacity is already present by age 4 and 80 
percent by age 8, ... the opportunity to influence [a child's] basic 
intelligence - considered to be a stable characteristic by age 17 ? is 
greatest in early life." End Quote

A year earlier in the same newspaper on October 14, 1990  an adult family 
literacy educator was quoted as saying, Quote: "Between the ages of zero to 
4 we have learned half of everything we'll ever learn in our lives. Most of 
that has to do with language, imagination, and inquisitiveness." End Quote

This doesn?t hold out much hope for the adults in family literacy programs.

Joan Beck was quoting research by Benjamin Bloom in the 1960s. But Bloom did 
not show that half of one's intellect was achieved by age 4. Rather, he 
argued that IQ at age 4 was correlated +.70 with IQ at age 17. Since the 
square of .7 is .49, Bloom stated that half of the variance among a group of 
adults' IQ scores at age 17 could be predicted from their group of scores at 
age 4. But half of the variability among a group of people's IQ scores is a 
long way from the idea that half of a given person's IQ is developed by age 
4. This is not even conceptually possible because for one thing there is no 
universally agreed to understanding of what "intelligence" is. Further, even 
if we could agree on what "intelligence" is, there is no such thing as "half 
of one's intellect" because no one knows what 0 or 100 percent intelligence 
is. Without knowing the beginning and end of something we Can?t know when we 
have half of it.

1990. A report by the Department of Defense shows how these beliefs about 
the possibility of doing much for adults can affect government policy. After 
studying the job performance and post-service lives of "lower aptitude," 
less literate personnel, the report claimed that they had been failures both 
in and out of the military. Then,  on February 24, 1990, the Director of 
Accession Policy of the Department of Defense commented  in the Washington 
Post newspaper, Quote: "The lesson is that low-aptitude people, whether in 
the military or not, are always going to be at a disadvantage. That's a sad 
conclusion." End Quote
A similar report of the Department of Defense study was carried in the New 
York Times of March 12, 1990. Then on April 8, 1990.  Jack Anderson's column 
in the Washington Post quoted one of the Department of Defense researchers 
saying, Quote: "...by the age of 18 or 19, it's too late. The school system 
in early childhood is the only place to really help, and that involves heavy 
participation by the parents." End Quote

Regarding the news articles about the Department of Defense studies of "low 
aptitude" troops, the conclusions were based on analyses of the job
performance of hundreds of thousands of personnel in both the 1960s and 
1980s with Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores between the 10th 
and the 30th percentiles, the range of scores which the Department of 
Defense studies called "low aptitude."

But contrary to what the Department of Defense researchers and accession 
policy maker stated, the actual data show that in both time periods, while 
the low aptitude personnel did not perform quite as well as those personnel 
with aptitudes above the 30th percentile, over 80 percent of the low 
aptitude personnel did, in fact, perform satisfactorily and many performed 
in an outstanding manner. As veterans they had employment rates and earnings 
far exceeding their rates and earnings at the beginning of the study. 
Further investigation by the media would have revealed these discrepancies 
between what the Department of Defense's researchers said and what the 
actual findings were. But as it stands, these popular media types of stories 
reinforce the stereotypes about adults with who score low on intelligence or 
aptitude tests and perform poorly on tests of the basic skills of literacy 
and numeracy.

We can find these pieces of scientific debris all the way back to the
Moonlight Schools of 1911.  Following her account of those educators and 
academics who declared that teaching grown people to read and write was 
contrary to the principles of psychology, Cora Wilson Stewart said, Quote: 
While they went around saying it couldn?t be done, we went on doing it. We 
asked the doubters this question, "When a fact disputes a theory, is it not 
time to discard the theory? There was no reply. End Quote

Today when we ask why the funding for adult literacy education is so little 
so late, there is still no reply. So we just keep on teaching adults to
read and write. And we do it on the cheap, even though it is theoretically
impossible.

It is very nice. And does not include the necessity of
a solid structured methodology. One of the reasons
that popular literacy campaigns fail (internationally)
is the lack of proper training, or an overemphasis on

According to the learners in Alisa's article "Learners on Learning to
Read", the following factors were cited as the most important for
successful reading development: 

1) their own motivation and determination, 
2) program features, including relationships with an instructor,
instructional strategies and materials, and structures and formats
3) reading practice
4) supports

We have covered 2) and 3) in the other thread of this discussion, but
what about 1) and 2)?

1) Motivation and determination: Alisa said of the students that: "Their
focus makes clear that the starting place for success is within them. 
It's not clear to me if teachers can create those conditions for
learners or if they have to find a way to do it themselves." What do you
all think?

2) Supports: Think about this quote from the article: "Practitioners
cannot create family- or faith-based support where there is none, but
they can heed the importance of building informal support within the
program." How important is this? How much of a supportive community
evnironment do you think your classes are? What factors contribute to
it?

Hello Everyone:

I'm very curious to know your reactions to this work.  As I was doing
the 
research I found the learners words to be very compelling, heartfelt,
well 
articulated, and interesting.  However, when I went to analyze the data,
I 
wondered if their perceptions really shed light on the big questions of
the 
day regarding teaching developing adult readers to read better.  I asked

myself whether they gave me information that was new.  I guess two
things 
really emerged for me.  One, that it was important to them that they be 
taught some technical skills and be given lots of opportunities to read 
interesting materials over extended periods of time (it seems like we
have 
a tendency to emphasize one or the other depending on our own beliefs,
but 
balance seems to be the key), and two, that they focused the discussion 
differently than teachers or researchers might do  Their focus makes
clear 
that the starting place for success is within them.  It's not clear to
me 
if teachers can create those conditions for learners or if they have to 
find a way to do it themselves.

Anyway, I'll be interested to know how this all strikes you.

Alisa

There is definitely a balance to strive for as we divide our time
between teaching the skills and creating an environment where learners
feel safe, comfortable and confident enough in their own skills to seek
out opportunitites to use their newly enhanced abilitites, reading and
otherwise. 

To get back to Alisa's article, I would like to hear more about how we
can encourage reading outside of class. What can do for students like
Juan (the young man in the article who reads almost nothing outside of
class, and has no print materials in his home)?

What have you done in your classes to encourage outside reading? (Maybe
we could augment the list at the end of the article with your ideas!)
Think about methods of encouragement as well as ideas for types of print
materials to suggest that will be engaging.

Has anyone ever offered a class library to your students? If so, how was
it received? If not, would this be feasible in your program? What
resources would you need?

I'm passing this on from Carol McDonnell.

Julie

******************************************

Putting meaningful books in students' hands seems to be one key to get
them reading. Offering interest driven options for Internet projects
also motivates students to read more. 

Our program uses abridged novels in class to encourage outside reading.
Some classes use novel "sets", so that all students read and discuss the
same material. Low level reading materials are also purchased on audio
tape.  Other classes form classroom "libraries". Does anyone remember
the concept of DEAR? (Drop Everything And Read) It works! We do see an
increase in outside reading when students enjoy books in class. Students
often ask to take books home. Last year, several students enjoyed A Tale
of Two Cities (abridged) so much that they checked out the full length
version from the library. One student rented the video.  

Some teachers ask students to choose a book for participation in a
literature circle.  The circles read and report out as a
group-discussing and answering a set of questions, offering a synopsis
to other students, and critiquing the story. I provide teachers with
various culminating activities that range from drawing and captioning a
scene from the book to charting character profiles. It's exciting to see
students animated in discussions, arguing points, sharing ideas, and
helping each other along.

Some of our year round classes have read full length books such as Think
Big by Dr. Ben Carson, and Life is So Good, the story of George Dawson.
Mr. Dawson's story is not only heartwarming and encouraging to emerging
readers, but offers an historical timeline from which many social
studies lessons can evolve. Dr. Carson actually spoke on one of our
campuses, and his message literally kept several of my students from
giving up. My team teaching partner and I presented those students with
a copy of his book. The talk also inspired several students to read
another title by this talented role model.

When we pilot a new title, the students are given the books to keep.
That seems to be another avenue to encourage reading. We also provide
books and dictionaries as "awards". 

Townsend Press has a wonderful offer on their website for low income
students. Students write a letter explaining their situation and can
request up to three books -free of cost- from a list of sixty. (Writing
a business letter is a skill that all students should learn. Receiving a
package is like icing on the cake.) Townsend offers many titles for one
dollar each! To keep costs down, they will Not honor requests from
entire classes or large groups.

Alisia's words validate my feelings on these matters.

>1) Motivation and determination: Alisa said of the students that: "Their

Motivation is like a seed that grows. I believe a teacher can plant and 
nurture the seed. Sometimes the seed doesn't grow. Usually it does. 
Sometimes it sits for a long time before showing signs of life. Teachers 
are not the only ones who plant seeds, of course.

I feel motivation is created through many little things in the 
environment. For example, respect the student's goals. Help the student 
formulate and refine his or her goals, but it always has to belong to 
the student. It is a very easy trap in which to fall of trying to get 
the student to accept your goals. It won't work. Other examples: giving 
frequent feedback on the progress a student is making towards a goal 
(e.g. certificates, credits, gold seals, etc.); making a big affair over 
accomplishment of large goals (e.g. commencement ceremonies, awards 
ceremonies, press releases);  create a structure within the edcuation 
program that makes completion requirements explicit and easy for the 
student to monitor; the teacher needs to be constantly talking about 
attaining goals, and helping students get there without wasting their time.

A book I find very instructive on motivation and education is Summerhill 
School, by A.S. Neill. He worked in the UK in the 1920's, with what we 
would today call severely emotionally disturbed students. In a somewhat 
counterintuitve way, Neill created conditions for motivation to develop 
in the most difficult students who had been rejected by all other 
schools. A hallmark of his approach was to accept if a student wanted to 
do absolutely nothing. He was prepared to wait until they were ready to 
do things on their own. He referred to this waiting period as "curing 
children of the toxic effects of their previous schooling." If I could, 
I would force all school teachers to read Summerhill.

>2) Supports: Think about this quote from the article: "Practitioners
>cannot create family- or faith-based support where there is none, but

Supports can be extremely beneficial for several reasons. Students 
helping each other helps both the helpee and the helper. When students 
work together in a helping community, they are encouraging each other 
and showing each other how they are working towards educational goals, 
and this helps build motivation. It is in the supportive community of 
students and teachers that positive relationships are formed. Everything 
builds on everything else.

Working in corrections education, this is a big challenge for me. There 
has to be a lot of trust among students for them to be willing to risk 
exposing their weaknesses and accept help from another. There isn't a 
lot of trust in prisons. People there also tend not to get along well 
with others. Many prefer working alone. Our teachers provide a lot of 
individual support. We intentionally try to separate the prison 
community from the school community. We refer to them as students, for

to school , we ask them to leave it at the door because now, they are in

There is one more thing I want to share about teacher-student

learned in the classes. The most valuable class I ever took was 7th 
grade typing, but I couldn't remember my teacher's name to save my life. 
Rather, it was all about the strength of the relationship I had with the 
teacher. I'm not sure whether it is absolutely essential for learning 
that there is a strong positive relationship (remember my typing 
teacher) but I did realize that if I want to be well remembered, I'd 
better have good relationships with my students.

Tom, 

I love your analogy of motivation being like a seed, and the several
points that connect the seed's situation to a learner's motivation: that
it needs to be both planted and nurtured; that it sometimes lies dormant
and then grows; and that there are different conditions as well as
different ways of nurturing that make it grow.

Alisia's words validate my feelings on these matters.

"Their

>It's not clear to me if teachers can create those conditions for
>learners or if they have to find a way to do it themselves." What do

Motivation is like a seed that grows. I believe a teacher can plant and 
nurture the seed. Sometimes the seed doesn't grow. Usually it does. 
Sometimes it sits for a long time before showing signs of life. Teachers

are not the only ones who plant seeds, of course.

I feel motivation is created through many little things in the 
environment. For example, respect the student's goals. Help the student 
formulate and refine his or her goals, but it always has to belong to 
the student. It is a very easy trap in which to fall of trying to get 
the student to accept your goals. It won't work. Other examples: giving 
frequent feedback on the progress a student is making towards a goal 
(e.g. certificates, credits, gold seals, etc.); making a big affair over

accomplishment of large goals (e.g. commencement ceremonies, awards 
ceremonies, press releases);  create a structure within the edcuation 
program that makes completion requirements explicit and easy for the 
student to monitor; the teacher needs to be constantly talking about 
attaining goals, and helping students get there without wasting their
time.

A book I find very instructive on motivation and education is Summerhill

School, by A.S. Neill. He worked in the UK in the 1920's, with what we 
would today call severely emotionally disturbed students. In a somewhat 
counterintuitve way, Neill created conditions for motivation to develop 
in the most difficult students who had been rejected by all other 
schools. A hallmark of his approach was to accept if a student wanted to

do absolutely nothing. He was prepared to wait until they were ready to 
do things on their own. He referred to this waiting period as "curing 
children of the toxic effects of their previous schooling." If I could, 
I would force all school teachers to read Summerhill.

>2) Supports: Think about this quote from the article: "Practitioners
>cannot create family- or faith-based support where there is none, but
>they can heed the importance of building informal support within the
>program." How important is this? How much of a supportive community
>evnironment do you think your classes are? What factors contribute to
>it?
>
>  
>
Supports can be extremely beneficial for several reasons. Students 
helping each other helps both the helpee and the helper. When students 
work together in a helping community, they are encouraging each other 
and showing each other how they are working towards educational goals, 
and this helps build motivation. It is in the supportive community of 
students and teachers that positive relationships are formed. Everything

builds on everything else.

Working in corrections education, this is a big challenge for me. There 
has to be a lot of trust among students for them to be willing to risk 
exposing their weaknesses and accept help from another. There isn't a 
lot of trust in prisons. People there also tend not to get along well 
with others. Many prefer working alone. Our teachers provide a lot of 
individual support. We intentionally try to separate the prison 
community from the school community. We refer to them as students, for 
example, not inmates. When they bring their prison language and behavior

to school , we ask them to leave it at the door because now, they are in

school. We maintain confidentiality. These things create a higher level 
of trust and mutual respect. It helps strengthen teacher-student 
relationships. It makes the school a desirable place to be.

There is one more thing I want to share about teacher-student

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 357]  FOB article on slef esteem
Message-ID: <CA29C5E82B801844A7A967D109F117CF5DB5FE@svrascmail01>

I just received and gave a cursory glace at the Low Self Esteem article
on FOB. I am skeptical of the results. I do not believe that our
students live lives of failure as the article suggests that some
teachers may believe. In fact I believe that they live lives of
incredible sacrifices, successes, triumphs, and overcoming tremendous
difficulties. However, society portraits them as failures though
different mechanisms, ie, low literacy, poverty, difficulty with
academic environments, domestic violence, lack of employment, blue
collar work, lack of citizenship or residency, racism, poor health, etc.
These are the tools that mainstream society uses to evaluate success or
failure of individuals. 

 

While most of our students are extremely hard working, passionate,
dedicated, excellent family providers, etc., they do not measure
themselves in terms of these, but in terms of the mainstream society
markers. The mainstream society markers have very detrimental effects in
our student self esteem. 

 

We have found that through a lot of motivation, creative writing, and
success in academic pursuits we are able to help students to see
themselves as they truly are instead of the mainstream societal markers
of success. As a result, we see our students,\' self esteem improve. 

 

In a society where the dominant media dictates that success is measured
primarily by wealth, possessions, intellectual entitlements and looks,
the poor, the dispossessed, those without degrees and those who don't
meet the standard look will have poor self esteem. Fortunately, there
are alternatives to the media that can validate people based on other
things. However, the competition against the mainstream media is tough. 

 

Years ago, FOB published an article by Steve Reader that found no
resistance among ABE students contradicting what Quigley and others have
previously founds. This article finds no lack of self esteem among ABE
students. These two articles contradict the obvious. To me, this means
that the testing the statistical analysis, the questions asked, the
understanding of the theory or other elements of the testing instrument
are flawed.    

 

Add to this the fact that self esteem and resistance are very hard to
understand and assess concepts and often unconscious. Asking questions
such as: Do you resist? Or: Do you have a low self-esteem? May not be
accurate ways to assess self-esteem.

 

Opinions, discussion? 

 

Andres

Your ideas mirror some of my own, Andres. Yet it seems to me that research in self-esteem is generally a difficult task, although an interesting and important one.  And, I would add that I think all of this revolves around one's definitions of self-esteem, and also success, failure, and so on.  As you note, these American concepts may not be the same as the concepts of self-esteem, success, failure, and so on, as seen in other societies and cultures.  

 

And, there are differences in perspective from each of the social and other sciences investigating levels of self-esteem.  All in all, a tricky business.  For example, in psychology, we might look at self-esteem as self-worth, how a person's subjective appraisal of him or herself affects their moods, attitudes, and behaviors.  As illustration, Maslow looked at self-esteem in two ways, lower and higher, the lower the need for respect of others; the higher the need for respect for oneself.  In this lower group he included over the years the need for status, fame, glory, recognition, attention, appreciation, for example, along with other aspects.  He is simply one theorist and practitioner who has contributed to the research on this subject, and guided the work of many others.  And his is simply one perspective, albeit a good one.

 

In sociology, examining another perspective, we have only to look at the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, a widely used tool in sociologic research.  Rosenberg opined that self-esteem is a positive or negative orientation toward oneself, that is, a self-evaluation of one's worth or value.  Yet, he believed that self-esteem was only one component of the self-concept, however.  Other components included all of an individual's thoughts and feelings, if I recall correctly. 

 

So again we can see differences in concepts and definitions, assumptions and expressions, all coming from the social sciences.  And to add to the mix, we could include the legal, philosophic, theologic, and medical perspectives, all differing.  I would also add that often studies of self-esteem are troublesome research projects because so much of the data collected is in the form of self-reports.  There are inherent issues with self-reports, although they are great tools in the absence of other methods.

 

Finally, Andre, I appreciate your understanding of the role of economics in both defining and measuring self-esteem.  We make assumptions, it often seems, about the populations we are studying and/or treating, based on our own experiences and our own place in the general economic, social, and political thoroughfare. Too often we forget the tremendous impact poverty makes on the human psyche from the onset of its travel through time.  And conversely, the impact wealth makes.  

 

In my research projects as well as my own practice as a life management consultant specializing in education, aging, careers, and life transitions, I see evidence of how all this plays out.  For example, in my private practice some of my clients have had significant first and second language problems, and it has been interesting to see the interaction with their "perceived" and self-reported levels of self-esteem.  There is tremendous variance.  In the end, I too have learned that along with other investigations of human characteristics, inquiries of self-esteem are "slippery slopes."

 

Thanks again for your response, and I, too, look forward to hearing from others on such an interesting topic.  If anyone has any specific questions about my research or  private practice, please contact me directly and I will be glad to respond.

Judith: 

 

I agree that self esteem is generally a difficult think to research and
measure. That is why I find it important to question the research. I am
not sure of the way self esteem was measured, but to try to measure it
as some sort of variable or report it in terms of manipulation of
variables is questionable at best. I think that the best we could do
measure self esteem is to define it as a collection of behaviors, and
then try to observe those behaviors in different contexts. This is still
hard to do since it requires the observer to be familiar with the
contexts and the presence of certain behaviors and the immersion of the
observer in a culture. In other words, research on self esteem needs to
have an ethnographic character. Sometimes, non-action can be a
demonstration of low self-esteem and other times it may not be. 

 

To me, it is important to understand that human psychology in social and
cultural contexts cannot be explained through traditional scientific
testing. I am certain that that was not the intention of the researcher.
However, the moment an article is published that says that research
showed no difference in the self esteem of x vs. y, then people will
conclude that the research is valid. Both self esteem and resistance are
central to the understanding of behaviors, successes and failures of the
poor, minorities, and culturally marginalized groups in our society and
in the classroom. If the scientific research invalidates the presence of
these, we are in trouble. At best, these studies demonstrate the
inability of science to understand the human mind.

Judith:

 

Here is something else that I wrote about self -esteem in the NLA
discussion:

 

Actually, self esteem or self worth is, historically an economic
measurement. With the advent of modernity, the value of man/woman ceases
to be given by inheritance, royalty, etc. It becomes the value of his
property. Hence man becomes homo-economicus. The estimation of an
individual (self-estimation-self-esteem) or the worth of an individual
is measured by the estimation of his/her property. 
 
The other estimation of value in Western society has been cultural
capital, measured by entitlements. So, the two big estimations of
success in our society are essentially economic and cultural capital. To
these, you can add others that the media have promoted, such as; beauty,
strength, health, etc. These are closely tied to economic success. 
 
Essentially, individuals who don't possess these attributes can work
towards achieving them, or can resist them by creating alternative
models of self worth. This is closely tied to the issue of resistance as
articulated by John Ogbu. When minority kids enter school, they are
asked to stop using their native languages and adopt the dominant
language model. They can either accept this and demonstrate academic
success or they can resist saying that it is tantamount to acting
"whitie" 
 
Resistance to the dominant model is a psychological accommodation to the
dominant model of self esteem. Since I am neither rich, nor I possess
entitlements of academic success, my self worth is low. However, if I
create alternatives to self worth, such as gang membership, toughness,
faithfulness, pride, etc., my self esteem will improve. This has been an
accommodation that many youth have embraced with the obvious negative
impact, dropping out of school and ending up in jail. 
 
However, this argument supports the idea that youth have low self esteem
measured from the academic model, since they reject it and create an
alternative model. Adults, in ABE classes may have not created an
alternative model of self worth. They have embraced the dominant model
of academic and economic entitlements and this is an important reason
for them to be there. When they fail, their self esteem naturally goes
down. This is exacerbated by the fact that society promotes the fact
that those who work hard can make it here. So, those who are not making
it are either lazy or dumb.

same as the concepts of self-esteem, success, failure, and so on, as
seen in other societies and cultures.  

 

And, there are differences in perspective from each of the social and
other sciences investigating levels of self-esteem.  All in all, a
tricky business.  For example, in psychology, we might look at
self-esteem as self-worth, how a person's subjective appraisal of him or
herself affects their moods, attitudes, and behaviors.  As illustration,
Maslow looked at self-esteem in two ways, lower and higher, the lower
the need for respect of others; the higher the need for respect for
oneself.  In this lower group he included over the years the need for
status, fame, glory, recognition, attention, appreciation, for example,
along with other aspects.  He is simply one theorist and practitioner
who has contributed to the research on this subject, and guided the work
of many others.  And his is simply one perspective, albeit a good one.

 

In sociology, examining another perspective, we have only to look at the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, a widely used tool in sociologic research.
Rosenberg opined that self-esteem is a positive or negative orientation
toward oneself, that is, a self-evaluation of one's worth or value.
Yet, he believed that self-esteem was only one component of the
self-concept, however.  Other components included all of an individual's
thoughts and feelings, if I recall correctly. 

 

So again we can see differences in concepts and definitions, assumptions
and expressions, all coming from the social sciences.  And to add to the
mix, we could include the legal, philosophic, theologic, and medical
perspectives, all differing.  I would also add that often studies of
self-esteem are troublesome research projects because so much of the
data collected is in the form of self-reports.  There are inherent
issues with self-reports, although they are great tools in the absence
of other methods.

 

Finally, Andre, I appreciate your understanding of the role of economics
in both defining and measuring self-esteem.  We make assumptions, it
often seems, about the populations we are studying and/or treating,
based on our own experiences and our own place in the general economic,
social, and political thoroughfare. Too often we forget the tremendous
impact poverty makes on the human psyche from the onset of its travel
through time.  And conversely, the impact wealth makes.  

 

In my research projects as well as my own practice as a life management
consultant specializing in education, aging, careers, and life
transitions, I see evidence of how all this plays out.  For example, in
my private practice some of my clients have had significant first and
second language problems, and it has been interesting to see the
interaction with their "perceived" and self-reported levels of
self-esteem.  There is tremendous variance.  In the end, I too have
learned that along with other investigations of human characteristics,
inquiries of self-esteem are "slippery slopes."

 

Thanks again for your response, and I, too, look forward to hearing from

Andres, I would agree in part with what you write, but it is my idea coming from my own work as a cognitive scientist in research that--with very careful thought and preparation--we can begin to understand some of how the human mind works.  

In my own research and practice, and along with my colleagues, who with me are building upon years of other scientifically-based and thought-provoking research into the human mind, I am aware of the pitfalls at all times, and am as fastidious as my own humanness allows as I go about investigating various subjects that include, with some flexibility, the questions inherent in the definition(s) of self-esteem.  And, it appears that we have come a long way in being able to provide "some" answers to "some" questions along those lines, as any well-done and critical literature review will demonstrate.  

Again, I refer to my original response to you today wherein I discussed the problems dealing with definitions and assumptions.  Each finding must be viewed with regard to the way in which the investigator or research scientist posits the terms.  Each assumption must be noted, for all the obvious reasons.  This is part of the quintessential nature of scientific research, whether the measurements are qualitative or quantitative or mixed.  

With these factors in mind, going back to the last few lines of your response below, I would then say that it is not that "we are unable to understand the human mind" as you write; rather, that "we are making great strides in understanding the human mind, but have a good way to go."

In sum, and in my humble opinion, and with all due respect to the foibles inherent in scientific research and the science model, I must say that we have not learned everything, surely, but we have learned a lot.  And with great appreciation to all who have gone before me, and all who work along side of me in this difficult work, I see the results in my own research and in my own private practice and am grateful.

  Judith: 

   

  I agree that self esteem is generally a difficult think to research and measure. That is why I find it important to question the research. I am not sure of the way self esteem was measured, but to try to measure it as some sort of variable or report it in terms of manipulation of variables is questionable at best. I think that the best we could do measure self esteem is to define it as a collection of behaviors, and then try to observe those behaviors in different contexts. This is still hard to do since it requires the observer to be familiar with the contexts and the presence of certain behaviors and the immersion of the observer in a culture. In other words, research on self esteem needs to have an ethnographic character. Sometimes, non-action can be a demonstration of low self-esteem and other times it may not be. 

   

  To me, it is important to understand that human psychology in social and cultural contexts cannot be explained through traditional scientific testing. I am certain that that was not the intention of the researcher. However, the moment an article is published that says that research showed no difference in the self esteem of x vs. y, then people will conclude that the research is valid. Both self esteem and resistance are central to the understanding of behaviors, successes and failures of the poor, minorities, and culturally marginalized groups in our society and in the classroom. If the scientific research invalidates the presence of these, we are in trouble. At best, these studies demonstrate the inability of science to understand the human mind.

Hi all,

I have just stumbled on this from a Nobel Laureate for Economics, Professor Amartya Sen:

"Illiteracy and a lack of numeracy are a greater threat to humanity than terrorism. Widening the coverage and effectiveness of adult education is a powerful tool in reducing insecurity, and enhancing the process of social cohesion."

It seems rather appropriate for this list, if not this thread.  He has other good quotes, see Wikipedia.

Cheers,

John

  Subject: [FocusOnBasics 360] Re: Response to Andres Muro and FOB articleonself-esteem


  Judith:

   

  Here is something else that I wrote about self -esteem in the NLA discussion:

   

  Actually, self esteem or self worth is, historically an economic measurement. With the advent of modernity, the value of man/woman ceases to be given by inheritance, royalty, etc. It becomes the value of his property. Hence man becomes homo-economicus. The estimation of an individual (self-estimation-self-esteem) or the worth of an individual is measured by the estimation of his/her property. 
   
  The other estimation of value in Western society has been cultural capital, measured by entitlements. So, the two big estimations of success in our society are essentially economic and cultural capital. To these, you can add others that the media have promoted, such as; beauty, strength, health, etc. These are closely tied to economic success. 
   
  Essentially, individuals who don't possess these attributes can work towards achieving them, or can resist them by creating alternative models of self worth. This is closely tied to the issue of resistance as articulated by John Ogbu. When minority kids enter school, they are asked to stop using their native languages and adopt the dominant language model. They can either accept this and demonstrate academic success or they can resist saying that it is tantamount to acting "whitie" 
   
  Resistance to the dominant model is a psychological accommodation to the dominant model of self esteem. Since I am neither rich, nor I possess entitlements of academic success, my self worth is low. However, if I create alternatives to self worth, such as gang membership, toughness, faithfulness, pride, etc., my self esteem will improve. This has been an accommodation that many youth have embraced with the obvious negative impact, dropping out of school and ending up in jail. 
   
  However, this argument supports the idea that youth have low self esteem measured from the academic model, since they reject it and create an alternative model. Adults, in ABE classes may have not created an alternative model of self worth. They have embraced the dominant model of academic and economic entitlements and this is an important reason for them to be there. When they fail, their self esteem naturally goes down. This is exacerbated by the fact that society promotes the fact that those who work hard can make it here. So, those who are not making it are either lazy or dumb. 
   
  Andres

I urge everyone to read this article. I was a bit confused at Andres' posts. The research Ana reports on was prompted by her observations that a number of writers had described adult basic education learners as having low self esteem, but the writers provided no empirical evidence for these judgements. So she sought out empirical evidence. Finding none, she constructed a study to do so. 

She found that the learners she surveyed had self esteem similar to that of doctoral students: and it wasn't "low" at all. She suggests that those who work with adult basic education students reevaluate any preconceived notions they may have about their students.

One can certainly argue about the validity of studies that try to measure self esteem, but I think the point that Ana's work makes, that we all meet our learners with open minds rather than pre-conceived notions, is a good one.

toward oneself, that is, a self-evaluation of one's worth or value. 
Yet, he believed that self-esteem was only one component of the
self-concept, however.  Other components included all of an individual's
thoughts and feelings, if I recall correctly. 

 

So again we can see differences in concepts and definitions, assumptions
and expressions, all coming from the social sciences.  And to add to the
mix, we could include the legal, philosophic, theologic, and medical
perspectives, all differing.  I would also add that often studies of
self-esteem are troublesome research projects because so much of the
data collected is in the form of self-reports.  There are inherent
issues with self-reports, although they are great tools in the absence
of other methods.

 

Finally, Andre, I appreciate your understanding of the role of economics
in both defining and measuring self-esteem.  We make assumptions, it
often seems, about the populations we are studying and/or treating,
based on our own experiences and our own place in the general economic,
social, and political thoroughfare. Too often we forget the tremendous
impact poverty makes on the human psyche from the onset of its travel
through time.  And conversely, the impact wealth makes.  

 

In my research projects as well as my own practice as a life management
consultant specializing in education, aging, careers, and life
transitions, I see evidence of how all this plays out.  For example, in
my private practice some of my clients have had significant first and
second language problems, and it has been interesting to see the
interaction with their "perceived" and self-reported levels of
self-esteem.  There is tremendous variance.  In the end, I too have
learned that along with other investigations of human characteristics,
inquiries of self-esteem are "slippery slopes."

 

Thanks again for your response, and I, too, look forward to hearing from
others on such an interesting topic.  If anyone has any specific
questions about my research or  private practice, please contact me
directly and I will be glad to respond.

I think that the best way to overcome initial resistance is to video  yourself and some others in a realistic way. Share the results, "good,  bad, and ugly," with some observations and room for others' comments.  Professional doesn't mean perfect; it means an openness to learn and to  apply what has been learned. When one person can approach it genuinely,  with some humor and appreciation for the process, it can really free up  others.

We are working here in South Dakota to strengthen our teacher training
and ongoing professional development system.  One tool that we have
looked at is video-taping.  Some of us feel this would be an extremely
useful tool, especially given the distances between our centers and the
travel, time and funding barriers that arise to many other PD options,
like peer observation.  

We do feel, however, that there would be a great deal of resistance to
using video taping by many of our teachers.  

Does anyone have any ideas on how to overcome this negative perception
of using video-taping as a PD tool?  

Thank you.

Do you remember what it  was like when you and your program first
implemented a computer-mediated instructional component to your adult
English language learner curriculum? How did it go? What advice could
you offer others who are considering that venture (adventure!)? 
 
Hello! We are Dominique Chlup, Assistant Professor and Director of the
Texas Center for the Advancement of Literacy and Learning (TCALL), and
Joellen Coryell, Research Fellow for TCALL from Texas A&M University. As
directors and instructors of online and computer-mediated instruction of
adult English language learners, you are invited to participate in a
survey study we are conducting. The purpose of the research is to
investigate the experiences of adult English language learner (ELL)
instructors and directors in providing first-time computer-aided
instruction for their students. Hopefully, the findings of this study
will help other ELL instructors and directors in their future
implementations of such instruction.   
 
The survey is comprised of a few open-ended questions that ask you to
inform us of your demographic information, the proficiency levels of
students you teach online, your experiences implementing or beginning
your computer-aided / online ESOL component(s), your general experiences
with providing this instruction, and any advice you can give new online
ESOL instructional providers. The completion time for the survey is
about 30 minutes. The surveys and website are password protected, and
your data will be accessed only by the two of us. Your complete
confidentiality is secure, and any report of the findings will not
reveal specific information that could be linked back to you or your
specific program. Therefore, we hope you will be candid in your
responses. 
 
The research involves completion of online surveys available at: 
For Instructors

If you choose to volunteer to participate, your completion of the survey
grants us your consent to use your data as part of our research. We will
request your email address and office phone number in the event that
response clarification is considered necessary. The analysis of the data
collected will be used in manuscripts intended for possible publication
and use by interested ESOL providers. We may also include the data and
interpretations in conference presentations. 
 
We offer our sincere gratitude, in advance, for your time, effort, and
consideration in participating in this research. Please do not hesitate
to contact us if you have any questions or specific clarification (see
the below information).

Hi Everyone,

I want to welcome our guest this week, Hal Beder, who will join us to
discuss his
recent FOB article: "Shaping and Sustaining Learner Engagement in
Individualized Group Instruction Classrooms". 

You can find the article at this link:
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1106

Hal is a professor at Rutgers University and has studied adult literacy
for more than 30 years. He is the project director for NCSALL at Rutgers
and for the National Labsite for Adult Literacy Education. We are very
pleased to have him with us.

I am going to open up the discussion with a few questions for you:

How many of you teach individualized group instruction? 

How do  you find that the three factors discussed in the article
(instructional system, teachers' roles, and classroom norms) affect your
learners? 

What other factors affect your learners' engagement?

I look forward to hearing from you!

Julie

Until reading Hal's article, I'd have answered yes to this without 
hesitation. However, reading his article, I'm going to have to say, 
that it's probably a combination of group and individual instruction. 
All students are pre tested and placed based on their scores.  My 
students are predominantly on the higher end of the TABE scale - but 
not always. Students are all individually assessed to see where they 
are in terms of actual GED readiness and then together we work on a 
plan of individual lessons. In addition to that, I incorporate group 
activities such as oral reading, current events and critical thinking 
skills into the classroom.


>How do  you find that the three factors discussed in the article
>(instructional system, teachers' roles, and classroom norms) affect your
>learners?

With regards to the Instructional System: for me, this comes down to 
understanding my student needs. Some of my students can easily work 
on their own and at their own pace and only need me when they hit a 
wall, or need clarification. On the other hand, some of my students 
can't function this way. They need a dialogue and as they put it, 
they "want someone to instruct them."  For example, I was out the 
first week of this new summer session which began on May 22. I had a 
new student who came in during that time. She was very much put off 
by what she did not deem as helpful. She returned 2 weeks ago, in the 
middle of the class time when as we were doing an oral reading 
assignment on the novel Miracle's Boys. She waited patiently and I 
could read the excitement on her face. She was smiling from ear to 
ear. She looked at me and said "This is what I'm looking for. I want 
someone that's going to involve me, and teach me." I explained that 
the class wasn't like what she walked in all the time...that there 
was a balance. She's returned every day since.  I don't think there 
is any ONE instructional system that works for all students and I 
think instructors have to be flexible and adapt to the needs of the 
student.  I think this relates directly to the teacher's role. I 
think the teacher's role is to facilitate learning - provide access 
to learning and in some cases be a bridge between the "life" skills a 
student brings with them and the "academic" skills a student is 
trying to attain. Some of our students don't need to find the same 
"school" like environment in our adult classrooms that one would find 
in the public school system - at the same time, some of our students 
do. They are looking for structure in what is sometimes a very 
chaotic life. The instructor is there to give guidance and support 
and that can many, many forms - whether it's an in depth lesson on 
how to add fractions with unlike denominators or if it's a discussion 
on current events in the town they live in. Teachers are there to 
open the doors and in some cases help students find the right path or 
at least show them the options they have available. Teachers are 
sometimes the only helping hand a student might have.

Classroom norms is the area I struggle with. I would love it if my 
students all came in with the "Stick to business" attitude. Some do 
and some don't. Those that don't are often a distraction for those 
that do. It's a constant battle and one I'm not sure how to win, if 
winning is the right word. Those students that don't come in with 
that attitude are the ones that want to be finished yesterday but who 
aren't willing to do any of the work. School and the classroom are a 
social time. We do have rules and a policy of writing them up if the 
offense is bad enough - such as cursing at the instructor or 
repeatedly being late to class after break.  For the students who 
don't have the "stick to business" attitude, I can honestly say based 
on my class this semester, they just don't care about the rules. 
Personally, I'd like to know how the classes observed in the article 
got to a point where "engaging and maintaining engagement for the 
entire class was a commonly accepted behavior of the class. It was so 
ingrained that it hardly ever needed to be enforced."



>What other factors affect your learners' engagement?

Distractions from their outside of school life: fear of losing their 
job, fear of losing their daycare, how they're going to put gas in 
their car, pay for daycare, pay for the utilities, keep their food 
from spoiling in the heat, get their car fixed, what they're going to 
do on Friday night, relationship issues with boyfriend/girlfriend or 
mom and dad etc.

Andres,

I too am skeptical about the findings in the article on Low Self Esteem 
because the findings go against what I witness in my day to day practice.

When students attending our service were asked how they felt about returning 
to education many reported being nervous and fearful.  They cited meeting 
other students and feeling 'stupid' in class as their biggest fears.  The 
majority of students were ashamed of their literacy difficulty.  They had 
spent most of their lives hiding their literacy problems from their peers, 
their employers and even their families; especially their children.

With time the students 'found their feet' in the class and enjoyed the 
support of the other students and generally felt comfortable in class.  I 
have found that a student may overcome many of his/her self-esteem issues, 
especially in relation to learning, after spending time in a positive 
learning environment.  I wonder, therefore, how long the students, in 
Lipnevich's  study, had been attending classes when they completed the 
study's questionnaire?

The students in Ana's study had been in the program various amounts 
of time.  Some were relatively new, some were old timers.  Most 
people are "nervous" when they undertake something new and 
difficult.  I suspect that everyone who reads this has experienced 
that kind of anxiety.  Indeed, as someone who teaches doctoral 
students, I know that even the most educated experience anxiety until 
they become familiar with the situation.  Initial anxiety is not the 
same as low self-esteem, however, as self-esteem is generally 
considered to be a relatively stable trait, not something that 
fluctuates.   Remember, the students in Ana's study were voluntary 
learners; they at least had enough self-confidence to 
participate.  Other research has shown that low-self esteem is a 
barrier to participation in adult literacy, so it may be that 
low-literate adults who lack self-esteem just don't enroll. I don't 
think the implication of Ana's work is that teachers should not be 
warm and supportive.  All adult educators, regardless of what and who 
they teach, should be supportive.  To me the implication is that 
beliefs that adult literacy students have abnormally low self-esteems 
because they have lived failed lives supports the stigma of adult 
literacy. In any case, Ana is out of the country now.  I hope that we 
can revisit this discussion when she returns.

I agree with his statement. However, I am making a slightly different
argument. I believe that adult literacy students have low self esteem
even though many lead very successful lives. This is because western
society and the media do not portrait their successes as true success.
Most media outlets, ie: TV, newspapers, books, magazines, schools,
leaders, etc tend to describe success in terms of economic capital,
cultural capital, looks and strength. Unless we take great steps to
battle these stereotypes and create alternative models of success,
students will measure themselves against the advertised models of
success. The indirect evidence of this is the investment that people
make to hide their poverty and limited literacy skills, the investments
that they make in trying to look like models, in diet plans, in schemes
to get rich, etc. they do this because they want to increase their self
esteem. Targets of schemes to get rich, to loose weight, etc are our
students and not doctoral students. You see ridiculous advertisements in
tabloid magazines not in research journals.     

Of course, doctoral students have esteem issues too. Their self esteem
is given by the ultimate entitlement, the Ph.D. However, in the esteem
scale of economic and cultural capital adult literacy students will
score a lot lower.

Ultimately, the point that I am trying to make is that the current way
society measures a person's value is all screwed up. This has a very
detrimental impact on the oppressed, the disenfranchised, the sidelined,
the marginalized, the abused, etc. In fact, the current scale is
directly responsible for the oppression, disenfranchisement,
marginalization, abuse, etc. So, we must work to change the measures of
a person's value rather than argue that our students do not have a low
self esteem.

There is another consideration, as well. I've worked with adolescents and adults who experience high self-esteem when it comes to working on cars, playing the guitar, or cooking, etc., but when it comes to reading, it's an entirely different story. Self-esteem seems to fluctuate dependent upon how comfortable one is with his/her skills/attributes in that area. Just a thouoght. barb given

Hello everyone,

Communications for the National Institute for Literacy. I would like to take
this opportunity to introduce myself along with three other new hires at the
Institute. The press release below introduces each of the four new hires and
identifies our roles and backgrounds. Thank you, and I look forward to
working with all of you. 


       National Institute for Literacy Appoints New Staff

The National Institute for Literacy has appointed four new staff members to
expand its capacity to contribute to improvements in adult, adolescent,
childhood and early childhood literacy.  

Andrea Grimaldi has joined the Institute as Senior Project Officer
in Early Childhood Literacy. She will be responsible for planning and
managing the Institute's work on early childhood literacy. She will also
oversee dissemination of the National Early Literacy Panel Report, expected
to be released in late 2006. 

My Linh Nguyen has joined the Institute as Associate Director of
Communications. In this capacity, she will plan and manage communications
activities designed raise awareness of literacy issues and the Institute's
products and services. 

The two other new staffers will join the Institute in July. Susan
Boorse, who will serve as Executive Officer, will have responsibility for
budgetary and financial management activities as well as administrative
functions. Heather Wright has been selected to serve as Dissemination
Specialist. In this capacity, she will plan and oversee implementation of
the Institute's print and electronic products to ensure that they are widely
and easily available.

"The arrival of these four individuals signals an exciting new era for the
National Institute for Literacy," said Dr. Sandra Baxter, the Institute's
Director. "Each of them brings fresh ideas and new perspectives along with
their diverse backgrounds and expertise. Their presence will reenergize our
existing programs and help us carry out new efforts to better serve the
adult and childhood literacy communities."

All four new appointees have a wide variety of experience in their
fields.

Ms. Grimaldi has more than a decade of experience as an early
childhood education teacher, program manager, and trainer. Most recently,
she served as the training manager for professional development with the
Public Broadcasting Service's (PBS) five-year Ready To Learn Initiative to
prepare young children for success in school through educational television,
web-based media and training for parents and teachers.

Ms. Nguyen comes to the Institute from the Delaware River Port
Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where she served as manager of
corporate communications and public information officer. She is a former
general assignment reporter and copy editor for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Ms. Boorse served in the Peace Corps for eight years as an
administrative and budget officer. She also served four years as a VISTA
volunteer, working with a literacy program in Philadelphia, a rural school
district in Mississippi, and a fledgling Philadelphia Habitat for Humanity
affiliate. 

Ms. Wright comes to the Institute from the Montgomery County
Department of Public Libraries in Maryland, where, as Children's Librarian,
she was involved in early literacy programs for babies, toddlers,
preschoolers and elementary-school children. Her previous professional
background is in the field of marketing research, where she conducted many
research studies to measure the needs of customers and target markets, both
in the library setting and in the private sector. 
	
The National Institute for Literacy provides leadership on literacy
issues, including the improvement of reading instruction for children,
youth, and adults. In consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education,
Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Institute serves as a national
resource on current, comprehensive literacy research, practice, and policy.

Message-ID: <s4a28674.066@mail.jsi.com>

Katrina brought up an interesting point about classroom norms. In Hal's
study it seemed that classroom norms were a major factor in engaging
learners, yet in his study classes the norm of "sticking to business"
seemed to be very smooth and unproblematic. My guess is that many
classroom situations have more of a mix, as Katrina describes. If this
is important in learner engagement, then we should discuss what we can
do to improve or enforce the classroom norms in those classes where they
are not consistent. 

How do we help everyone "stick to business"? Are there other classroom
norms besides "sticking to business" that are important?

Until reading Hal's article, I'd have answered yes to this without 
hesitation. However, reading his article, I'm going to have to say, 
that it's probably a combination of group and individual instruction. 
All students are pre tested and placed based on their scores.  My 
students are predominantly on the higher end of the TABE scale - but 
not always. Students are all individually assessed to see where they 
are in terms of actual GED readiness and then together we work on a 
plan of individual lessons. In addition to that, I incorporate group 
activities such as oral reading, current events and critical thinking 
skills into the classroom.


>How do  you find that the three factors discussed in the article
>(instructional system, teachers' roles, and classroom norms) affect
your
>learners?

With regards to the Instructional System: for me, this comes down to 
understanding my student needs. Some of my students can easily work 
on their own and at their own pace and only need me when they hit a 
wall, or need clarification. On the other hand, some of my students 
can't function this way. They need a dialogue and as they put it, 
they "want someone to instruct them."  For example, I was out the 
first week of this new summer session which began on May 22. I had a 
new student who came in during that time. She was very much put off 
by what she did not deem as helpful. She returned 2 weeks ago, in the 
middle of the class time when as we were doing an oral reading 
assignment on the novel Miracle's Boys. She waited patiently and I 
could read the excitement on her face. She was smiling from ear to 
ear. She looked at me and said "This is what I'm looking for. I want 
someone that's going to involve me, and teach me." I explained that 
the class wasn't like what she walked in all the time...that there 
was a balance. She's returned every day since.  I don't think there 
is any ONE instructional system that works for all students and I 
think instructors have to be flexible and adapt to the needs of the 
student.  I think this relates directly to the teacher's role. I 
think the teacher's role is to facilitate learning - provide access 
to learning and in some cases be a bridge between the "life" skills a 
student brings with them and the "academic" skills a student is 
trying to attain. Some of our students don't need to find the same 
"school" like environment in our adult classrooms that one would find 
in the public school system - at the same time, some of our students 
do. They are looking for structure in what is sometimes a very 
chaotic life. The instructor is there to give guidance and support 
and that can many, many forms - whether it's an in depth lesson on 
how to add fractions with unlike denominators or if it's a discussion 
on current events in the town they live in. Teachers are there to 
open the doors and in some cases help students find the right path or 
at least show them the options they have available. Teachers are 
sometimes the only helping hand a student might have.

Classroom norms is the area I struggle with. I would love it if my 
students all came in with the "Stick to business" attitude. Some do 
and some don't. Those that don't are often a distraction for those 
that do. It's a constant battle and one I'm not sure how to win, if 
winning is the right word. Those students that don't come in with 
that attitude are the ones that want to be finished yesterday but who 
aren't willing to do any of the work. School and the classroom are a 
social time. We do have rules and a policy of writing them up if the 
offense is bad enough - such as cursing at the instructor or 
repeatedly being late to class after break.  For the students who 
don't have the "stick to business" attitude, I can honestly say based 
on my class this semester, they just don't care about the rules. 
Personally, I'd like to know how the classes observed in the article 
got to a point where "engaging and maintaining engagement for the 
entire class was a commonly accepted behavior of the class. It was so 
ingrained that it hardly ever needed to be enforced."



>What other factors affect your learners' engagement?

Distractions from their outside of school life: fear of losing their 
job, fear of losing their daycare, how they're going to put gas in 
their car, pay for daycare, pay for the utilities, keep their food 
from spoiling in the heat, get their car fixed, what they're going to 
do on Friday night, relationship issues with boyfriend/girlfriend or 
mom and dad etc.

I'm not sure that classroom norms are *only* a concern for learners; what
about meetings where practitioners sometimes struggle to balance the work on
the table and the social pieces - not just chatter, but the relationship
building undergirding so much of the work we do?

Is the question more about how work/learning get done and about balance?
I'm not sure how completely different these issues are in classroom contexts
and in other contexts where people meet to accomplish some purpose or
another (learning, meeting, workshop, etc...)

Good day, 
  
  This is certainly an interesting topic. 
  
  The dynamics aren't discernibly different to me, but as the paid  professional I'm responsible to ensure that a spoken and unspoken  groundrule is that the vehicle for communication will be English. In  some groups it's easier than in others. The best advocates and guides  for that norm can be those who learned English in that way. It helps  those tempted to make class a social gathering in their own language  realize that they really can learn to communicate in English.

For us the interesting thing about the norm sticking to business was that
it was established by both teachers and learners through mutual consensus.
It was part of the conetext of instruction rather than a set of imposed
rules.  These were voluntary learners who came pre-disposed to work. So I
think sticking to business comes naturally for adult learners.  If you
have a class where learners are not sticking to business, it may be a sign
that something is wrong.

Hi
This is Toni-Ann from Kentucky.  It is interesting that we just had a 
similar discussion here yesterday with a number of people, including a 
legislator interested in how we tap the community who most needs literacy 
services.  One of the contributors to the discussion provided anecdotal 
evidence of people he has worked with who believed that they were the only 
people in their community who had literacy problems. He was convinced that 
it was not so much a self-esteem issue but more  that people viewed their 
lack of literacy skills like a taboo disease - something they should cover 
up, not talk about and not seek help through public areas.  Those with low 
levels of literacy often learn remarkable coping skills which for them are 
easier to build and maintain than it is to build and grow literacy skills.
So - what can be done to assure these people that they are not alone and 
that there are resources available that will provide more services to them 
than continuing to "hide" a problem that in their minds exist for them alone.
Toni-Ann

Message-ID: <44A3DEB8.8000401@ccsdistrict.org>

Julie asked  "Are there other classroom norms besides "sticking to 
business" that are important?"

I was surprised when I read Hal's study on engaging learners that most 
of the classes in the study used an individualized workbook approach.  I 
have never found this approach to be very engaging.  I wonder what the 
students are engaged with.  Are they engaged in learning or getting 
through the workbook pages?  Do they struggle to make sure they 
understand the concepts or just plow through to get done?  When 
correcting their answers using the key in the back of the book do they 
think about where they went wrong and be sure they understand or do they 
just change their answer to the correct one?   I have seen students take 
a workbook home over the weekend and do the whole workbook and believe 
that they now have moved up a grade level in reading. I think there are 
much more engaging approaches than the individualized workbook approach.

Message-ID: <44A403DA020000A000002C7E@fgwiel01a.wie.de.future-gate.com>

I think it's a huge assumption to state "sticking to business comes
naturally for adult learners." That assumes that  that everyone that
enters an ABE program is an adult both in age, and attitude. The latter
being the key.  The assumption is that all the adult learners in an ABE
program WANT to be there and that's not always the case.  There is
nothing "natural" for the adult learner who is mandated by court or
other local, state or federal guidelines that require an ABE/GED course.
 

The program model you observed is an "ideal" for many of us, I would
hazard to say,especially for those of us who deal with younger students
just out of high school.   The key word you stressed below was
"voluntary;" great - what about those that aren't voluntary sitting in a
class with those who are? I have taught in Adult Education for 10 years
now, and the mixture is always there - those who want to be there vs
those who HAVE to be there. This makes "sticking to business" some days
next to impossible.  I can't throw students who don't stick to business
out of my class. I can ask that they be quiet, focus, try to work hard.
I can sit with them, etc. I can do many things to address the negative
behavior but it doesn't mean I can make the student "stick to business."
 Instructors are bound by both local and state regulations as to
discipline - at least here. We can have local policies in place but at
the same time, when everything is driven by FTE's and student
progression, EVERY student becomes critical to program success and
retaining those students who don't want to be there is as important as
retaining those studens who WANT to be there. In light of that, not
every class room is going to exemplify "sticking to business" as
highlighted in the article.  The "ideal" situation isn't what some of us
face day to day. The question really is how do you address the problem
to benefit all - those who want to be there, and those who HAVE to be
there.  ( I think this is also what happens in meetings etc, which Janet
asked about.  Those that want to be there are ready to get to work, get
it done and get back to business - those that have to be there, want to
talk about their trips to the beach, their families, the weekend etc -
anything to avoid what they didn't want to deal with in the first
place.)

Additionally, there is a time and place for building social skills and
teamwork through discourse in the adult classroom setting. Not all
instruction occurs via a text, a worksheet or a math problem to be
solved.  Some skills such as getting along with others, expressing
diverse view points, and listening to diverse view points can only be
learned when you don't strictly, "stick to business" but go beyond the
"business" of getting a GED And into the "business" of building a more
successful student in a wholistic manner.

For us the interesting thing about the norm sticking to business was
that
it was established by both teachers and learners through mutual
consensus.
It was part of the conetext of instruction rather than a set of imposed
rules.  These were voluntary learners who came pre-disposed to work. So
I
think sticking to business comes naturally for adult learners.  If you
have a class where learners are not sticking to business, it may be a
sign
that something is wrong.

I agree. We're struggling with this "workbook" approach in our own
setting - because some of the instructors think just giving a student  a
workbook is helpful  and it sets in place a series of events where a
student MIGHT learn enough to pass the GED or Improve a Level but at the
same time, may not retain what they have learned for the long term. This
becomes very problematic for students who want to puruse academic goals
beyond the GED/AHS environment - students who are then relegated to
developmental or remedial classes, grow frustrated and ultimately give
up. 

I think it's important to explain HOW a student is engaged in the
learning process when you're talking about a workbook approach to
things.  Administrators in my state would bristle at this concept but
they'd argue it flies in the face of "quality" instruction...that
somewhere there needs to be dialogue and discussion and interaction -
not just workbooks and worksheets.

Message-ID: <s4a3c6cd.095@mail.jsi.com>

In the article, Hal does talk about some ways that the individualized
group instruction (IGI) model supports and detracts from engagement, and
how teachers can improve engagement within this model (assigning
appropriate materials, having a good system for engaging those waiting
for help, and being effective with the one-on-one moments of giving
help.) 

The value of the IGI model over others is another question that is out
of the scope of the article, but may be worth discussing. The IGI model
that Hal decribes seems a bit more interactive than "just giving a
student a workbook".

It may be helpful to look at another article from this issue of FOB:
Instructional Practices of ABE and GED Teachers
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1109

I think it would be helpful to hear from Hal about why they chose the
IGI model for this study, how this model differed from small group
instruction in terms of learner engagement, and more about how this
model and the teachers using it can support engagement.

Well to get back to learner engagement - how does how the learners view 
themselves interact with all the other factors that Hal refers to? Given 
that the "context of the adult literacy education classroom shapes 
learners' engagement in instruction" is the context powerful enough to 
"overcome" what the learner brings especially if it is not something that 
the educators expect?

When I was doing my teacher preservice, the lesson was drilled into us, 
workbooks=BAD, experiential/hands-on=GOOD.

So it was with great relish that I developed courses for my students 
(aged 17-60+) that were rich in hands-on experiential learning. And it 
was with great consternation that I listened to one of my younger 
students say to me, "don't you just have some workbooks I can do?"

I think we have to be mindful that students have preferences and it's 
wrong to write off one mode of learning such as workbooks just because 
it doesn't fit with our own preferred mode, or those of 'experts' who 
know what's best. First of all, we have to take the student wherever he 
or she may be in terms of abilities, goals, and preferences. Then we try 
to get him or her to think differently about things. We can't actually 
change students' thinking, but we can give students things to think 
ABOUT. This, in turn, creates the conditions in which the students 
themselves will expand or alter their thinking. I believe it is risky to 
try to rush this process. If my student is ready for workbooks and I try 
to get him to do do other things, I risk scaring him off, or I risk 
trying to make him conform to MY goals, not his own. That's what was 
done to them when they were children. My students, who are mostly pretty 
alienated from school and education, are wise to this. Their radar goes 
up in a flash when they sense it.

While workbooks (or textbook chapters) are not my preferred way of 
learning, we do offer them to students who want them. American Guidance 
Service (AGS) publishes a wide variety of textbooks in the different 
subject areas, and they also sell CD roms with workbook pages, chapter 
tests, etc. They are quite comprehensive and while their scope is at the 
high school level, they are written at a lower reading level than 
regular high school texts. Students who choose this path do so because 
credit requirements are explicit. It is very highly structured; there 
are no surprises or guessing games. They can work at their own pace and 
they can work on their own time, often working far more productively 
than they could if they simply attended a class. It has always amazed me 
that I could never get my students to do 'homework' but I can give them 
one of those AGS text books and they will work 20 hours a day on it.

Is it the best way to learn? Not for me it isn't. But it's what the 
student wants, what the student is ready for presently. Maybe I will be 
able to make it a hook to entice the student to pursue some topic more 
deeply.

Very good question.  In one of the classes we studied the teacher 
emphasized getting the right answers on the worksheets and assumed 
that if students did get the right answers, they had mastered the 
material.  Understanding that getting the right answer was the name 
of the game, the learners developed strategies to increase their 
chances of getting the right answer that sometimes subverted the 
purpose of the exercise.  So in respect to this class, you may have 
identified a problem.  Yet in other classes, teachers orally quizzed 
learners while correcting their work to diagnose whether they really 
did understand and then helped them if they did not.  I do think it 
is possible for learners to get correct answers on some workbook 
exercises without really understanding what the exercise is designed 
to teach.  For that reason, the diagnosis step is quite important.

Of course you are right.  Learners who participate in adult literacy 
against their will have less motivation to "stick to business".  I 
say "less" motivation rather than "no" motivation because we had at 
least two court-mandated learners in the study who worked very hard 
and made good progress.  In respect to young learners, the Center was 
ideal in that the district had an alternative high school, and K-12 
students who were discipline problems were sent there rather than 
being dumped into adult classes.  Also, the Center did have a 
mandated welfare class but these learners had their own class and 
were not mainstreamed into the classes we studied. Your posting 
raises important policy questions.  In many ways the classes we 
studied at the center were ideal, but as literacy professionals, 
don't we deserve the ideal?

         Reply to:   [Focusing 382] Re: norms
Working with mandated students in GED class as well as previously in drug and alcohol rehab I have been interested in this dilemma for some time. Research on motivation has shown that the issue of voluntary vs. involuntary "particpation" matters less than what happens once a student is IN the placement situation (classroom or therapeutic envrinoment, for example). The turn around is internal but it can be self-motivated or due to external pressure. The critical key is what happens to engage the student once they are a "captive audience". Not that this is easy by any means....

Forgive me for not citing specific research. I will try to do some homework to back this up. MM

Tom, Hal, and others

Tom has raised an issue which nearly every adult education (including  
ESOL) teacher who embraces experiential, hands-on, participatory,  
constructivist/project-based, and transformational learning faces:  
their view of good teaching/learning practice vs. their students'  
often more conservative textbook, workbook, lecture, and chalkboard  
notes model of teaching.  The answer, I believe is a negotiated  
approach, where the teacher agrees to use some textbook and/or  
workbook materials, and perhaps lectures or presentations,  and the  
students agree to try the teacher's chosen approaches.

Hal, I wonder if you have seen examples of this negotiation process  
and, if so, if you could tell us about them.

Good point.  In another study we did that is reported in the same 
FOB, we found that IGI is more common in GED than in lower level 
classes.  In GED the goal is clear and concrete--pass the GED 
tests.  IGI materials articulate well with achieving this goal. 
Learners want to pass the tests as quickly as they possibly can and 
the teacher in the GED class we studied understood this.  Skills and 
knowledge that were not on the GED tests were seen as a 
deviation.  So the teaching/learning technology in the GED class was 
extremely efficient in helping learners to achieve the stated goal of 
the class, that being to achieve a GED.  But does GED instruction of 
this type prepare learners for post-secondary?   That's a real 
concern and I don't know the answer.  On one hand the learners in the 
GED class were truly in dependant learners and it could be that IGI 
supports the development of independant learning skills.  Yet did 
this GED instruction ignore other important skills that learners need 
to be successful in post secondary?  Perhaps. When you look at the 
NCSALL research on the economic benefits of obtaining a GED, the 
conclusion is that a GED alone does not get you much. So transition 
to, and success in, post secondary education is a huge issue.  In my 
view, adult literacy and achievement of the GED needs to be viewed as 
a beginning, not as an end point.

         Reply to:   motivational interviewing research
Here is some good research on Motivation Interviewing - a well-researched technique that does increase internal motivation for court-mandated clients in D&A programs. The first link is to a handbook that describes motivational interviewing, working with resistance, and "norming" changes, etc. I think it would be a good study model for adult educators.

1)  http://casacrenewal.com/CourseOutlines.html

These links below represent a very basic overview of the first wo pages of links I just did on Google using keywords: motivation, clients, mandated, treatment. Just basic recent research in D&A arena.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 386] Re: individualized workbook approach

When I was doing my teacher preservice, the lesson was drilled into us, 
workbooks=BAD, experiential/hands-on=GOOD.

So it was with great relish that I developed courses for my students 
(aged 17-60+) that were rich in hands-on experiential learning. And it 
was with great consternation that I listened to one of my younger 
students say to me, "don't you just have some workbooks I can do?"

I think we have to be mindful that students have preferences and it's 
wrong to write off one mode of learning such as workbooks just because 
it doesn't fit with our own preferred mode, or those of 'experts' who 
know what's best. First of all, we have to take the student wherever he 
or she may be in terms of abilities, goals, and preferences. Then we try

to get him or her to think differently about things. We can't actually 
change students' thinking, but we can give students things to think 
ABOUT. This, in turn, creates the conditions in which the students 
themselves will expand or alter their thinking. I believe it is risky to

try to rush this process. If my student is ready for workbooks and I try

to get him to do do other things, I risk scaring him off, or I risk 
trying to make him conform to MY goals, not his own. That's what was 
done to them when they were children. My students, who are mostly pretty

alienated from school and education, are wise to this. Their radar goes 
up in a flash when they sense it.

While workbooks (or textbook chapters) are not my preferred way of 
learning, we do offer them to students who want them. American Guidance 
Service (AGS) publishes a wide variety of textbooks in the different 
subject areas, and they also sell CD roms with workbook pages, chapter 
tests, etc. They are quite comprehensive and while their scope is at the

high school level, they are written at a lower reading level than 
regular high school texts. Students who choose this path do so because 
credit requirements are explicit. It is very highly structured; there 
are no surprises or guessing games. They can work at their own pace and 
they can work on their own time, often working far more productively 
than they could if they simply attended a class. It has always amazed me

that I could never get my students to do 'homework' but I can give them 
one of those AGS text books and they will work 20 hours a day on it.

Is it the best way to learn? Not for me it isn't. But it's what the 
student wants, what the student is ready for presently. Maybe I will be 
able to make it a hook to entice the student to pursue some topic more 
deeply.

The Engagement Study that we are discussing here and the Classroom 
Dynamics study which we conducted perviously were both based on 
classroom observation. I would not be surprised if our team has 
observed more adult literacy education classes than any group in 
modern history.  Yet I can think of only two classes in all of that 
where the instructional approach was negotiated, and even in those 
two classes, negotiation was not common.  In general, teachers direct 
and learners acquiesce.  In Classroom Dynamics this was true for even 
the most participatory classes.
In participatory classes, participation occurred because teachers 
elicited it, not because the learners requested it.  There are cases 
where learners expressed a special need and teachers acknowledged 
it.  In one class in the Engagement Study, for example, a learner had 
to take the drivers exam and asked for help with the manual.  The 
teacher then used the manual as a authentic resource.  In Classroom 
Dynamics, there were a couple of classes that were organized around a 
theme such as employment.  In these classes learners had some say in 
the choice of theme. All in all, adult literacy education is a very 
much teacher-directed [and in some cases materials directed] enterprise.

Tom, Hal, and others

Tom has raised an issue which nearly every adult education (including 

ESOL) teacher who embraces experiential, hands-on, participatory,  
constructivist/project-based, and transformational learning faces:  
their view of good teaching/learning practice vs. their students'  
often more conservative textbook, workbook, lecture, and chalkboard  
notes model of teaching.  The answer, I believe is a negotiated  
approach, where the teacher agrees to use some textbook and/or  
workbook materials, and perhaps lectures or presentations,  and the  
students agree to try the teacher's chosen approaches.

Hal, I wonder if you have seen examples of this negotiation process  
and, if so, if you could tell us about them.

	Special Topics	list!
Message-ID: <s4b25028.005@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm sorry this is late, but here is a reminder from David Rosen about a
discussion on the Special Topics list with John Comings on Learner
Persistence STARTING TODAY! Please read on...

Julie
**********************************

Colleagues,

On the Special Topics discussion list from July 10th-18th, Dr. John  
Comings, Director of the National Center for the Study of Adult  
Learning and Literacy (NCSALL), will  be a guest to discuss his  
research on student persistence in adult literacy education.

John introduces the discussion this way:

"When a group of us at World Education were preparing to write the  
proposal for the funds that have supported NCSALL, we surveyed  
practitioners and policy makers around the country to help us design  
our research agenda. Almost 500 people participated in the survey. We 

asked the survey participants to send us the questions that they  
wanted answered to help them improve practice in ABE, ESOL, and GED  
programs. One question was at the top of the list for teachers and  
second on everyone else's list. One teacher phrased it this way,  
"Just when they begin to make progress, many students leave the  
program.   How can I keep those students long enough that they can  
meet their educational goals?"

That question formed the basis of a three-phase study of persistence. 

The first two phases are complete.  The first phase surveyed the  
literature, interviewed 150 students in the six New England states,  
and identified ways that programs were trying to support the  
persistence of their students. The report of that first phase can be  
found at:

<http://www.ncsall.net/fileadmin/resources/research/report12.pdf>

In the second phase, 9 library literacy programs were provided with  
funds to implement interventions that might help improve persistence, 

and our study team observed the programs and interviewed their staff  
and students. We also followed a cohort of 180 students for 14  
months.  The report of that second phase can be found at:

<http://www.mdrc.org/publications/401/overview.html>

We are prepared to implement the third phase, but NCSALL no longer  
has funding to begin a new research project. This next phase would  
test three interventions. One would add persistence supports to  
existing classroom programs, one would use a wide range of modes of  
learning (in programs and through self study on-line and in other  
ways) that more closely match the way adults manage their learning,  
and the third would combine these two approaches. I believe the third 

approach is a promising way to solve the persistence problem, as well 

as it can be solved.

I'm looking forward to your questions, but I would also be interested 

in practical ideas of how to build support to persistence and how to  
expand opportunities for learning."

I have to agree with Jane here.  Workbooks seem to give students
comfort, but skills gained by their use alone are marginal at best.  In
my experience, students who most want the workbook are the ones most
likely to succeed best with other modalities of study. For some reason
the workbook=student work in their minds.  Has anyone found a way to
shift this paradigm?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 381] individualized workbook approach

Julie asked  "Are there other classroom norms besides "sticking to 
business" that are important?"

I was surprised when I read Hal's study on engaging learners that most 
of the classes in the study used an individualized workbook approach.  I

have never found this approach to be very engaging.  I wonder what the 
students are engaged with.  Are they engaged in learning or getting 
through the workbook pages?  Do they struggle to make sure they 
understand the concepts or just plow through to get done?  When 
correcting their answers using the key in the back of the book do they 
think about where they went wrong and be sure they understand or do they

just change their answer to the correct one?   I have seen students take

a workbook home over the weekend and do the whole workbook and believe 
that they now have moved up a grade level in reading. I think there are 
much more engaging approaches than the individualized workbook approach.

Study Circle Guide: Adult Student Persistence

 

Newly revised to include the second phase of the NCSALL research on adult
student persistence, this guide provides comprehensive instructions for
facilitating a 10?-hour study circle. It explores what the research says
about adult student persistence and ideas for how to apply what is learned
in classrooms and programs. The guide is based on a review of the NCSALL
research on adult student persistence conducted by John Comings and others,
summarized in an article entitled ?Supporting the Persistence of Adult Basic
Education Students? and other studies on student motivation and retention.
It includes articles, resources, and action research reports to help
practitioners consider strategies for increasing adult student persistence.
This guide provides all the necessary materials and clear instructions to
plan and facilitate a three-session study circle with an option for a
fourth. Each session lasts three-and-a-half hours.

Virgnia,
I think the issue that is being raised is part of parcel of what adult learners bring to learning experiences from their early K-12 experiences.  Sometimes it can be helpful to talk about alternative ways of learning in the classroom as adults. This isn't a quick and easy remedy reply but I wanted to raise the question of how we can as adult educators help learners explore alternative ways of learning in the classroom.  Pierre Dominice has explored the process of "learner biographies" with much success with graduate students. THis is a process of exploring learner experiences in learning situations both in classroom and out and some critical themes that have been forumulated as a result of these experiences.  I think this journey back to "roots of learning" can help learners identify ways in which they have been both successful/unsuccessful in learning.  What are some thoughts on this type of process for basic literacy/ESOL students?
Esther

I asked this question earlier - why are these standards so much better than anything else?  Adopting standards won't necessarily change HOW teachers teach/don't teach in their classrooms. I think Esther made a good point.  An adult learner brings their past learning experiences to the adult classroom with them and one of the things we as instructors need to do is establish/discuss with the students what worked for them before vs what didn't work. To talk about where they are now as learners outside the class - what works and what doesn't.  Sometimes, the adult education instructor has no background and little knowledge or understanding of the differences between pedagogy and andragogy when it comes to the adult classroom; they may not know anything about learning style differences or how to implement activities  that address multiple learning styles. 

I just don't think the implementation of content standards like EFF is the only answer / way to address the problem of workbook only type instruction and its pitfalls and/or successes.

Katrina Hinson

Tom,

Basically, pedagogy refers to teaching of children while andragogy refers 
to teaching of adults.

Hi everyone - my name is Tracy, I also was trained in k-12 but have worked 
with adults as well. I am presently finishing my MA in human systems 
intervention at Concordia University and am going to begin a new position in 
a few weeks at BJEC (the Bronfman Jewish Education Centre) as the special 
education coordinator for the schools in the Jewish education system in 
Montreal.
Nice to meet you all!

Here is a reference for andragogy:

"In practical terms, andragogy means that instruction for adults needs to 
focus more on the process and less on the content being taught. Strategies 
such as case studies, role playing, simulations, and self-evaluation are 
most useful. Instructors adopt a role of facilitator or resource rather than 
lecturer or grader." - taken from http://tip.psychology.org/knowles.html

I would argue, though, if you want to wordsmyth, that pedagogy can be 
synonymous with andragogy. At least it is in Quebec, where I work. The 
Quebec education program is now much more based in process rather than 
content and students (and teachers!) are being encouraged and trained to 
look at how they learn in order to facilitate the learning of content. 
Students are also being assessed on the 'how' as well as the 'what'. Most 
learning is becoming project-based so that learners are working in 
'real-life' scenarios and there is a large self-evaluation component as 
well. In fact, in elementary school most parent-teacher interviews have 
become student-led conferences.

I know that these kinds of reforms are happening in Ontario as well, and I 
am sure that this is going on elsewhere too. I am just not aware of it.

So, from my perspective, good pedagogy is learner-centered and focuses on 
process and therefore not different from andragogy.

Below is an excellent website that focuses on the differences between
Pedagogy and Andragogy. The first is "teacher" centered the latter is
"Student" centered - in short. I recommend you read the article on the
website.  Knowles is a good reference as well for andragogic learning
and the reasoning behind it. If you "google" Knowles, and Andragogy,
you'll probably pull up his research models.

Thank you Katrina. I can see how the two terms differentiated by age of learner, but I think the world would be a better place if they had not. There are many teaching concepts from K12 that would fit well in andragogy such as constructivism, student-centeredness, authentic materials, authentic assessment and self-assessment, but they often seem to get badly misinterpreted when put into practice. I think these things are imperiled even in adult education.

Perhaps a reason why is that teachers tend to teach the way they were taught. We are prisoners of our own experience. This is how educational traditions perpetuate. It is extremely difficult to break out, and when we do, we encounter students who say, "just give me the workbook." I guess students are prisoners of their experience too.

I'm being picky--"androgogy"'s root is andr = male.  Personally, I 
avoid this word.

It was coined, I believe by an adult educator whose name I have 
temporarily forgotten--but someone else will know, I am sure.

Pedagogy in my pea-sized brain mesns teaching, or the art of teaching.  
I use this word.

Tom,

You've highlighted a lot of the terms that are so important to the EFF 
framework (http://eff.cls.utk.edu/fundamentals/default.htm): 
constructivism, student-centeredness, authentic materials, authentic 
assessment and self-assessment.

And Katrina- this is one of the reasons why I believe that the EFF 
standards are different (I'm not saying the only standards or the best) 
from many others because they build from many of these important concepts 
and are meaningful to the learners.

Tom,
I agree with your commments.  I think that is why I feel it is so important for instructors to be critically reflective in their work. We need to explore some of the hidden beliefs that have helped formulate our ideological principles which in turn point us to our methods of teaching.  A few weeks past the list discussed videotaping as a form of Professional Development for adult ed instructors.  I believe that these types of PD opportunities for educators can help facilitate a better understanding of what impact (positive and negative) we are having with learners in the classroom, as well as help us to explore creative alternatives in learning situations. 
Esther

You're welcome.

 I agree with you and the others on the list that have made reference to
the overlap of both terms. I think they do too. I also think that if
more "adult" learner practices were utilized in a traditional setting,
improvements might occurr in many areas.  I can also see the benefit of
many skills that cross over from K-12 that fit. I also see daily some
that don't. I can go and observe many k-12 classrooms in my own state 
where teachers still are focused on imparting their knowledge INTO a
student as if they were a sponge trying to soak it up.   I am very
thankful daily for the teachers I had growing  that were so out of the
box and very much student centered that it's never left me.  From them I
learned that learning occurs in a million ways and not all of them come
from a text book.  I was engaged from the moment I entered their doors
until I walked out.  That's not always the case though and for adult
learners especially; we have to make sure we don't make the mistake of
giving them just a workbook though...even if that's all they ask for. We
need to help them find ways to learn that incorporate what they know,
and how they have learned in the past, so that they have some sense of
ownership in their own learning. From my experience, ownership in the
learning process is something that rarely occurs in a traditional k-12
class. There are exceptions most assuredly,...but I don't think it's the
norm.   (None of that may have come out as well as it's racing through
my head. Busy day - so forgive me if it makes no sense.) 

 I also agree  that  authentic materials and authentic assesessment are
most assuredly central to adult learning in my opinion.    I have often
thought or wished I could use the model I use in my adult ed classroom
in a k-12 classroom just to highlight to policy makers and teachers who
do hold on to "traditions" that sometimes, traditions need to evolve and
change to meet the changing demands of the learners filling and leaving
the seats in public school.

Thank you Katrina. I can see how the two terms differentiated by age of
learner, but I think the world would be a better place if they had not.
There are many teaching concepts from K12 that would fit well in
andragogy such as constructivism, student-centeredness, authentic
materials, authentic assessment and self-assessment, but they often seem
to get badly misinterpreted when put into practice. I think these things
are imperiled even in adult education.

Perhaps a reason why is that teachers tend to teach the way they were
taught. We are prisoners of our own experience. This is how educational
traditions perpetuate. It is extremely difficult to break out, and when
we do, we encounter students who say, "just give me the workbook." I
guess students are prisoners of their experience too.

The National Institute for Literacy and the National Center for the Study of
Adult Learning and Literacy present Persistence Among Adult Education
Students Panel Discussion

This 30 minute video focuses on persistence in ABE, ESOL, and GED programs,
and features a NCSALL study entitled, "Supporting the Persistence of Adult
Basic Education Students."

Dr. John Cummings presentation examines student persistence in adult
education programs. He presents a working definition of persistence,
examines existing research, and describes NCSALL's three-phase study of the
factors that support and inhibit persistence. Other panelist include two
practitioners, Kathy Endaya and Ernest Best.

Hi Andrea: This is interesting. You noted that the root of andragogy is
'male'. But pedagogy also has a root--' child' , like pediatrician -
(doctor for a child). As an adult educator, how do you reconcile that?

I'm being picky--"androgogy"'s root is andr = male.  Personally, I 
avoid this word.

It was coined, I believe by an adult educator whose name I have 
temporarily forgotten--but someone else will know, I am sure.

Pedagogy in my pea-sized brain mesns teaching, or the art of teaching.

According to my sources, the root is "From the Greek words "anere", for
adult and "agogus", the art and science of helping students learn" - 
(coined by American educator Malcolm Knowles )

I was surprised by this, as I too have associated the Andr root with
"male".
I wonder how the "d" got in there?

Well the traditional methods of teaching or the processes - the lecture,
the project, the demonstration, drill and reviews, the Socratic question
and answer are still applicable to our world of adult education
"classrooms". It is how we as teachers or "facilitators" of learning
utilize the needs, goals, desires, capabilities and real life
experiences of our learners in the respective learning experience for
each individual learner. We can focus on the process and help adults
develop transferable "skills" that can be used in various "content"
areas...
If you haven't already done so, you may also want to check out the
Equipped for the Future conceptual framework that speaks to content AND
skills. It refers to a purposeful, transparent, contextualized and
constructivist learning experience for our adult learners...
And my 2c worth on the debate in referring to the adult education realm:
I would choose andragogy instead of pedagogy which has as a root,
"child".

What if we refer to what we do as educating? It seems less 
offensive/problematic. Educate comes from ex- out and ducere - lead. To lead 
out.

Or, we can forget all of this wordsmything and focus on teaching and 
learning because, when it comes down to it, I don't think that focusing on 
problems that may or may not have arisen due to the misuse of terminology is 
the issue.

Whether it is called pedagogy, androgogy, education, facilitation, teaching, 
learning...it seems that, from what I have read so far, everyone on this 
forum is interested in fostering learner success and is in agreement that in 
order to do so we need to meet the learner where she/he is at and create 
authentic learning activities that respond to the needs and experiences of 
that learner.

no?

Hi Andrea: This is interesting. You noted that the root of andragogy is
'male'. But pedagogy also has a root--' child' , like pediatrician -
(doctor for a child). As an adult educator, how do you reconcile that?

I'm being picky--"androgogy"'s root is andr = male.  Personally, I
avoid this word.

It was coined, I believe by an adult educator whose name I have
temporarily forgotten--but someone else will know, I am sure.

Pedagogy in my pea-sized brain mesns teaching, or the art of teaching.
I use this word.

I reconcile the problem by extending pedagogy to the adult--this is 
often used, as the meaning has been expanded.

I go for the simple stuff:  teacher, student, works for me.

I will continue to speak of adults who are undertaking a course of 
study as "students."

I'm being picky--"androgogy"'s root is andr = male.  Personally, I

It was coined, I believe by an adult educator whose name I have

Pedagogy in my pea-sized brain mesns teaching, or the art of teaching.

Yes, I went to the book shelf this am to review a couple of Mr. Knowles'
books. I don't mean to leave anyone out of the discussion and meant no
disrespect at all. I do agree that teaching is an art and we can help to
lead - or assist in learners in finding their own way. I kind of like
Andres'  "andragynegogy". That made me smile.
Thanks for the intellectual stimulation today. Be well everyone!

Hi Everyone,

I am passing on this message from Tom Sticht>

Julie

**********************************************************
Colleagues: My Google search found that the term andragogy was
originally
formulated by a German teacher, Alexander Kapp, in 1833. He used it to
describe elements of Plato's education theory. Andragogy (andr- meaning
'man') could be contrasted with pedagogy (paid- meaning 'child' and
agogos
meaning 'leading'). Following is a long two part note that makes
distinctions between the cognitive processes of children and adults and
the
reasons why teaching methods for the former may not be generally
transferable to adults across the years. The first note calls attention
to
how the present government activities are pushing adult education more
and
more into the mold of childhood education. The second note illustrates
with
the National Assessment of Adult Literacy that it is not valid across
the
age range from 16 to 90 years. The human cognitive system changes
dramatically with age and this is one reason why approaches to education
based on children's approaches are not transferable across the life
span.
As children grow into adulthood pedagogy should be transformed into
andragogy (andra- considered now as meaning "adult" rather than "man" in
keeping with the idea that language constantly changes and new functions
are found for old forms).
Tom Sticht

Part 1. In Adult Literacy Education: Must Andragogy Recapitulate
Pedagogy?

In many industrialized nations today there appears to be a movement in
adult
basic skills education to have andragogy, defined as theories and
methods
for teaching adults, recapitulate pedagogy, defined as theories and
methods
for teaching children. This is suggested by many ideas and actions that
are
being initiated in adult literacy education.

For instance, in many cases adult literacy education is thought of as a
"second chance" at learning what should have been learned in the primary
grades of school. In this case, then, it seems to be assumed that adults
should be taught the "3 Rs" in the same way that children are taught
them.
Indeed, in the United States the National Institute for Literacy
(www.nifl.gov) includes web pages on the "scientific basis" for teaching
adults to read that are based primarily on research in the K-12 grade
school system. The focus is on teaching alphabetics (phonics, decoding,
word recognition) and reading comprehension in the same way that
children
are taught.

The U. S. Department of Education has created a National Reporting
System
for adult literacy education that has requirements for programs to show
how
adults learning literacy progress upward through levels of proficiency
with
each level being about equal to two "grade levels" of proficiency, as
though adults in literacy programs are recapitulating  grade school.
Such
an approach is also found in the United Kingdom with adults in basic
skills
education expected to progress up to the same sorts of skills as
children in
the primary grades acquire.

Further, adult literacy programs are often asked to measure progress in
adult learning in their programs using standardized tests that are based
on
methods used in measuring progress in the grade schools. In some cases,
adult literacy development is stated in terms of gain in reading grade
levels, as if adults were going to school for six hours a day for 180 or
so
days a years to make a year's gain in reading or other basic skills.

One consequence of this belief that andragogy should recapitulate
pedagogy
is that a great misunderstanding of adult literacy education occurs. In
particular, there is a tendency for policymakers and funding agencies to
think that adult literacy education is the same as children's literacy
education and that may lead to the idea that, instead of investing much
by
way of resources into adult literacy education, we will be better served
by
"stopping the problem at the source" and focussing instead upon young
children to prevent adult literacy problems.

However, such an approach fails to recognize that, in thirty years of
trying, and after spending over a trillion dollars in preventing
reading failure in the public schools, recent data from the U. S.
National
Center for Education Statistics for the years from 1971 to 2004 show
that
reading scores for 9, 13, and 17 years old have remained about the same,
with some up and down fluctuations over the years. So up to now, at
least
in  the U. S., there has not been much success in "stopping the problem
at
the source."

Also, the belief that andragogy ought to recapitulate pedagogy in
literacy
education fails to recognize that while the teaching of basic skills as
abstract "skills" may follow the same practices as for adults, the
"content" in which the basic skills instruction is embedded should not
be
the same as for children. Over one hundred years of adult literacy
practice
has provided professional wisdom indicating that adults should be taught
in
a "functional context," meaning that the content used to teach reading,
writing, and arithmetic ought to reflect the kinds of daily needs that
adults face.

This showed itself in World Wars I and II during which time soldiers
were
taught to read using materials that embedded basic skills instruction
with
important military information. This type of taking account of adult's
functional contexts does occur in many adult literacy programs today
where
materials of importance to adults, such as what to do in case of spousal
abuse, what kinds of health problems adults might be facing with
themselves
or their children, how to deal with consumer fraud, workplace demands
for
basic skills, and on and on are used to teach literacy.

The fact that the "content" of adult literacy programs is so different
from
that of primary grade children reflects attention to andragogy. But when
the focus is on abstract "skills" devoid of any particular content,
literacy instruction for adults begins to recapitulate the pedagogy of
children.

There is a need today for adult literacy educators to stand up for
andragogy
and to insist upon the rights of adult literacy students to have their
education focussed upon their current life circumstances. There is
evidence
to suggest that this will not only make adult literacy learning more
desirable and palatable for adults, it can also lead to greater rates of
participation, retention, better learning, and greater transfer from the
classroom to the world in which the adults live outside the classroom.


Part 2. Fluid and Crystallized Literacy Assessment and Development With
Adults:
Challenges to the Validity of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult
Literacy
(NAAL)

The disinction between the "skills' and "content" aspects of education
has
revealed itself in psychometric research on intelligence over the last
half
century. This research has
resulted in a trend to draw a distinction between the knowledge aspect
and
the processing skills aspects of intelligence. Beginning in the 1940s
and
continuing up to the 1990s, Raymond Cattell and various collaborators,
and
later many independent investigators, made the distinction between
"fluid
intelligence" and "crystallized intelligence." Cattell stated, "Fluid
intelligence is involved in tests that have very little cultural
content,
whereas crystallized intelligence loads abilities that have obviously
been
acquired, such as verbal and numerical ability, mechanical aptitude,
social
skills, and so on. The age curve of these two abilities is quite
different.
They both increase up to the age of about 15 or 16, and slightly
thereafter, to the early 20s perhaps. But thereafter fluid intelligence
steadily declines whereas crystallized intelligence stays high" (p. 23).

Cognitive psychologists have re-framed the "fluid" and "crystallized"
aspects of cognition into a model of a human cognitive system made-up of
a
long term memory which constitutes a knowledge base ("crystallized
intelligence") for the person, a working memory which engages various
processes ("fluid intelligence") that are going on at a given time using
information picked-up from both the long term memory's knowledge base
and
a sensory system that picks-up information from the external world that
the
person is in. Today, over forty years of research has validated the
usefulness of this simple three-part model for thinking about human
cognition.

The model is important because it helps to develop a theory of literacy
as
information processing skills (reading as decoding printed to spoken
language) and comprehension (using the knowledge base to create meaning)
that can inform the development of new knowledge-based assessment tools
and new approaches to adult education.

The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), the National Adult
Literacy Survey (NALS) of 1993 and the new 2003 National Assessment of
Adult
Literacy  (NAAL) all used "real world" tasks that are complex
information
processing
tasks that engage unknown mixtures of knowledge and processes. For this
reason it is not clear what they assess or what their instructional
implications are.

Colleagues and I used the simple model of the human cognitive system
given
above to analyze performance on the NALS. It was  concluded that the
NALS
places large demands on working memory processes  ("fluid intelligence")
and that is what may account for some of the large declines in
performance
by older adults. To test this hypothesis, an assessment of knowledge
("crystallized intelligence") was developed and
used to assess adult's cultural knowledge of vocabulary, authors,
magazines
and famous people.. The results showed clearly that  younger adults did
better on the NALS with its heavy emphasis on working memory processes
("fluid literacy") and older adults did better than younger adults on
the
knowledge base ("crystallized literacy") assessment .

Given the differences between younger and older adults on "fluid
literacy"
and "crystallized literacy"  there is reason to question the validity of
using "real world" tasks like those on the Prose, Document and
Quantitative
scales of the IALS, NALS, and  NAAL to represent the literacy abilities
of
adults. In general, when assessing the literacy of adults, it seems wise
to
keep in mind the differences between working memory or "fluid" aspects
of
literacy, such as fluency in reading with its emphasis upon efficiency
of
processing, and the "crystallized" or knowledge base aspects of reading.

It is also important to keep in mind these differences between fluid and
crystallized literacy in teaching and learning. While it is possible to
teach knowledge, such as vocabulary, facts, principles, concepts, and
rules, it is not possible to directly teach fluid processing. Fluidity
of
information processing, such as fluency in reading, cannot be directly
taught. Rather, it must be developed through extensive, guided, 
practice.
Though I know of no research on this theoretical framework regarding the
differences between fluid and crystallized literacy and instructional
practices in adult literacy programs, it can be hypothesized that all
learners are likely to make much faster improvements in crystallized
literacy than in fluid literacy, and this should be especially true for
older learners, especially those over 45 to 50 years of a

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 426] Andragynegogy and the individualized workbook
	approach
Message-ID: <s4b63880.077@mail.jsi.com>

Everyone,

Now that we have gone back to the roots, explored some merits of child
vs. adult-based and teacher vs. student-based approaches, and come up
with a fair term, I would like to go back to Esther's original question:

"...how we can as adult educators help learners explore alternative ways
of learning in the classroom.  Pierre Dominice has explored the process
of "learner biographies" with much success with graduate students... I
think this journey back to "roots of learning" can help learners
identify ways in which they have been both successful/unsuccessful in
learning.  What are some thoughts on this type of process for basic
literacy/ESOL students?"

Has anyone used this kind of process, and with what kind of results?

Julie

P.S. See below for other comments from our recent discussion that are
relevant to this process:
************************************************************** 
Perhaps a reason why is that teachers tend to teach the way they were
taught. We are prisoners of our own experience. This is how educational
traditions perpetuate. It is extremely difficult to break out, and when
we do, we encounter students who say, "just give me the workbook." I
guess students are prisoners of their experience too. 
- Tom Woods

it is so important for instructors to be critically reflective in their
work. We need to explore some of the hidden beliefs that have helped
formulate our ideological principles which in turn point us to our
methods of teaching.  A few weeks past the list discussed videotaping as
a form of Professional Development for adult ed instructors.  I believe
that these types of PD opportunities for educators can help facilitate a
better understanding of what impact (positive and negative) we are
having with learners in the classroom, as well as help us to explore
creative alternatives in learning situations. 
- Esther

We need to help them find ways to learn that incorporate what they know,
and how they have learned in the past, so that they have some sense of
ownership in their own learning.

Virgnia,
I think the issue that is being raised is part of parcel of what adult
learners bring to learning experiences from their early K-12
experiences.  Sometimes it can be helpful to talk about alternative ways
of learning in the classroom as adults. This isn't a quick and easy
remedy reply but I wanted to raise the question of how we can as adult
educators help learners explore alternative ways of learning in the
classroom.  Pierre Dominice has explored the process of "learner
biographies" with much success with graduate students. THis is a process
of exploring learner experiences in learning situations both in
classroom and out and some critical themes that have been forumulated as
a result of these experiences.  I think this journey back to "roots of
learning" can help learners identify ways in which they have been both
successful/unsuccessful in learning.  What are some thoughts on this
type of process for basic literacy/ESOL students?
Esther

Tom,

You are a clever person, so I think you could come up with an alternate 
to andragogy that would satisfy most of us,,"all of us" might be 
impossible. It is a truly aggravating word.  I hear it and I know that 
I and all like me, are excluded.

So, I must say, anyone who reads this email, will know that when they 
use the a-word,or hear the a-word,  they are leaving a lot of people 
out, namely all who are female.  "Way it goes.

OK, I want to tuck something in here, it is not quite a response to Tom 
because I don't yet have one.  But I will this fall, I hope.

The brain comes "online" at regular intervals up to I believe 25 years. 
A child's brain is very different from an adult's brain.  A lot has 
been made of the frontal lobe in adolescents--it hasn't matured yet, 
which "accounts'"f or aspects of adolescent thinking.

Beyond this, it seems that the speed of processing may increase up to 
60 years of age.  Speed is dependent on the  fatty coating of myelin 
around the  nerves--fat speeds  electro-chemical impulses.  We "think" 
using electrochemical neuron hook-ups.

Much conscious learning takes the form of puzzle solving.  This is true 
of how children learn to raad, I don't know if there is yet a 
description of how adults learn to read.  I DON'T mean all that stuff 
about  fluency, comprehension the way it  is usually talked about and 
measured.

I DO  mean the study by Ferreiro and Teberosky, "Literacy Before 
Schooling."  Andres, you manly fellow, listen up!  The research was 
done in Buenos Aries, from 1974-1976.

Fischer  et al has done studies of adult learning ( students who are 
adults) and come up with the same puzzle solving data.  Fischer can 
graph his stuff--computer modeling.

Message-ID: <CA29C5E82B801844A7A967D109F117CF624C76@svrascmail01>

The discussion about calling the difference between children and adult
education different things is purely rhetorical. The question is not
about how to name the approach, but to determine what the differences
are. It really doesn't matter if we call it pedagogy, andragogy or adult
education. I prefer pedagogy for many reasons. One is that it is the
term most accepted worldwide. The other reason is because it is the term
used by Freirians whom I sympathize with. When Freire wrote the Pedagogy
of the Oppressed and subsequently many literacy campaigns were launched
in poor countries, the focus was on adult education.  

Regarding the differences between children and adults there are things
that remain a mystery. We know that the child's brain and the adult
brain are different because one is growing and the other fully formed.
We know that there is a critical time when children begin to acquire
language that is essential in language acquisition. However, beyond
that, we know some things may work with children. It is not clear if the
language acquisition processes that work with children apply to adults
because there hasn't been much research done with adults. However, we
can report from our experience and, scientifically, until our
experiences and finding for children are challenged by different
findings for adults, I will use some of the findings for children and
will try to apply them to adults. 

For example, the work done by Cummins on native and second language
acquisition and Basic interpersonal communication skills and cognitive
academic language skills (BICS vs CALPS) has been done with children.
However, I have used this model with adults with great success and
experiences from others who report on this clearly support Cummins.
Essentially the argument is that people can acquire academic skills in a
language after they have basic interpersonal communication skills in
that language. Academic skills from L1 can then transfer to L2. So,
after learning about this I switched from doing ESL to doing Spanish GED
with our Spanish speaking adults. The result has been that they quickly
acquire academic skills in Spanish and then they can transfer them to
ESL.

I think that the most comprehensive work on reading acquisition comes
from Frank Smith and it is based on children. However, w/o going into
detail, I've found most of Smiths work on reading acquisition certainly
applies to adults. 

Carol Chomsky's five stages of reading acquisition were formulated with
children. In my experience, they certainly apply to adults.  

Of course, there are sociological, physiological and psychological
factors that affect learning. These represent variables that are often
not accounted for when studying language acquisition and are variables
that are hard to isolate for scientific research. These include poverty,
race, gender, culture, disability, health, relationships, self esteem,
resistance, etc. 

When using a language acquisition model with a group of learners and it
doesn't work, we need to wonder if it didn't work because it wasn't the
appropriate model, or because a variable, not accounted for, interfered
with acquisition. Using one of Kozol's examples, if a child has a
toothache and doesn't learn with a given approach, is the approach
wrong? Or, maybe it is the fact that the pain does not allow him to
concentrate. Another example: If a battered woman is not learning, is
the approach a bad one, or the external circumstances are the obstacle.
Finally, considering these sort of variables, are interventions to
address these sort of variables elements that needs to be integrated
into the approach or are they separate from the approach. To me, the
greatest contribution of Freire and other critical pedagogists is the
idea that any approach must address variables in context. In fact the
intervention for the specific variable is the essence of any  approach.
In other words, the intervention for the specific variable may even be
more important than the approach itself. However, this is difficult to
study scientifically and requires that we step outside the confines of
positive science.   

What do you all think?

OK, I want to tuck something in here, it is not quite a response to Tom 
because I don't yet have one.  But I will this fall, I hope.

The brain comes "online" at regular intervals up to I believe 25 years. 
A child's brain is very different from an adult's brain.  A lot has 
been made of the frontal lobe in adolescents--it hasn't matured yet, 
which "accounts'"f or aspects of adolescent thinking.

Beyond this, it seems that the speed of processing may increase up to 
60 years of age.  Speed is dependent on the  fatty coating of myelin 
around the  nerves--fat speeds  electro-chemical impulses.  We "think" 
using electrochemical neuron hook-ups.

Much conscious learning takes the form of puzzle solving.  This is true 
of how children learn to raad, I don't know if there is yet a 
description of how adults learn to read.  I DON'T mean all that stuff 
about  fluency, comprehension the way it  is usually talked about and 
measured.

I DO  mean the study by Ferreiro and Teberosky, "Literacy Before 
Schooling."  Andres, you manly fellow, listen up!  The research was 
done in Buenos Aries, from 1974-1976.

Fischer  et al has done studies of adult learning ( students who are 
adults) and come up with the same puzzle solving data.  Fischer can 
graph his stuff--computer modeling.

Katrina and all,
I was looking over the discussion and noticed your comment about learners coming away from experiences with a sense of "ownership" of the material.  This I believe is very significant, but is difficult to create or hold the space for unless instructors are open to the negotiation process that occur in learning situations.  We do not all have the same context or frame of reference therefore learners are always negotiating "what's real" or applicable for them. Unfortunately the K-12 system doesn't facilitate this kind of process and many learners shut down because they just can't reconcile all of the inconsistencies. Down the road, many of these learners come into our programs and they continue to feel detached from material. 
 
The "learner biography" process gives learners the time and space to look at all of those earlier learning experiences, and to search for significant themes that have emerged from these experiences.  It is a very powerful process and having gone through this myself in graduate school, I know that the outcome can be quite significant.  I would be willing to be involved in a research project that could look more closely at this process for basic literacy learners if there is an opportunity to support this kind of research.  What do others think?
Esther

http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Summer-Fall-2000/holmes.html but 
the text of the paragraph I liked is below.

"Mohring (1989) took issue with both andragogy and pedagogy. She contended 
that the terms andragogy (implying the education of adults) and pedagogy 
(meaning the education of children) are etymologically inaccurate. 
Although pedagogy is derived from paid, meaning "child," from antiquity it 
has also stood for education in general-without reference to learners' 
ages. Andragogy is derived from aner, meaning adult male and not adult of 
either sex, therefore excluding women. In view of efforts to purge English 
of sexist words, she proposed the use of a new term, teliagogy. Based on 
the Greek teleios, meaning "adult," it would include both sexes. "

It must be summer vacation time or something. Otherwise we wouldn't have 
time to contemplate the vagaries of our terminology. Still, this 
discussion has been enlightening for me because it has exposed the roots 
of some of our educational traditions and assumptions. For instance, 
there is the gender issue. There is the idea that children need to be 
treated differently than adults when it comes to educating them. There 
is the idea of "leading" towards greater knowledge, implying an active 
role for a teacher and placing the teacher out in front.

I find these assumptions rather troubling, although they help me 
understand how our present educational system has gotten where it is. 
What I find troubling is that both pedagogy and andragogy are used to 
signify the study of teaching rather than the study of learning. My 
personal philosophy of education defines learning as growth and that 
learning, not teaching, is the most important thing. I prefer to see my 
role as being one of helper, not leader. I can help students shape their 
goals; I can provide resources and experiences that will help them reach 
their goals. But I feel it is extremely important for me, and my 
students, to remember they are not MY goals.

It is so easy to get on the wrong track and begin to try to get the 
student to adopt the teacher's or the institution's goals. It could look 
like enrolling a student in a class that doesn't have enough students in 
it to make it viable. It could look like "teaching to the test" in order 
to show measurable progress. It could take any of dozens of other forms.

The study of teaching automatically puts the activity of the teacher 
front and center. I believe the study of learning puts the focus where 
it belongs, on the learner. It has been my experience that when you can 
center on learning and on the student, it cures a host of ills. Maybe 
the term epistemology, is closer to what I'm after.

Hello, Tom!

Yup, it is definitely summer vacation.

I think you are right, too, about putting  the focus on learning.  
Learning is actually growth, up through a series of cognitive steps, 
down which the student falls  when  a new problem to be solved comes 
along.  Growth really does mean going from  the  concrete to the more 
abstract.  Every new problem, it's  the same.  We're all like that when 
we try to solve problems.

Happy summer.

Andrea

	Decriptors in NRS
Message-ID: <s4bb799c.021@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

There is an informal discussion on the Assessment list this week about the changes in ESOL Level Descriptors.

To subscribe to the Assessment Discussion List, go to:  http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Assessment

See below for a description from Marie Cora.

All the best
Julie

****************************
Good morning, afternoon, and evening to you all.  I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to let everyone know that during this week, Larry Condelli from AIR (American Institutes of Research), who works with the NRS, and Sarah Young, from CAL (Center for Applied Linguistics) who works with BEST Plus will be available to answer any questions you might have regarding the changes in ESOL Level Descriptors, which go into effect this summer (this month I believe).  I also encourage anyone who has questions regarding other ESOL tests (CASAS or EFF for example) to join in this Q&A.  Because the Level Descriptors have been adjusted, the tests used to track learning gains also have undergone some shifting and it is important that we understand what these changes are.  

Larry and Sarah will be present on the List during this week, but perhaps intermittently *?? replies may not come immediately.  I encourage you to post your question to the List, or to send your question to me for posting, if you prefer that.  

Larry, Sarah, and others working with any of the ESOL tests *?? feel free to jump in and give us a thumbnail sketch of what the changes are and how they might affect our work in programs and with students.

The NRS homepage is located at:  http://www.nrsweb.org/

To view information on the NRS Level Descriptors, please go to:  http://www.nrsweb.org/reports/NewESLdescriptors.pdf

At the bottom of the NRS homepage, see also:  NRS Changes for Program Year 2006

Thanks so much *?? I*??m looking forward to understanding this information, and hearing what folks questions are regarding the changes.

I have a great interest in reflection and use reflective practice  
with the teachers I train.  In the past, I have also asked English  
Language Learners to do reflective tasks, such as writing their  
history of learning English.  What guiding questions have you used in

We have classes for migrant workers. Last year we started to have them
write their own stories which we published. You can see them at
http:bordersenses.com/memorias.

It was an incredible project. Some students had very limited literacy.
One woman only had 2nd grade education from Mexico, and she earned her
GED. She became a published author together with many other students. 

 

We are about to publish the second issue of memorias. If we get some of
the funding that we are expecting, we will continue to do this.
Publishing student stories is a powerful motivational tool for the
entire family.

 

Andres

Katrina and all,

I was looking over the discussion and noticed your comment about
learners coming away from experiences with a sense of "ownership" of the
material.  This I believe is very significant, but is difficult to
create or hold the space for unless instructors are open to the
negotiation process that occur in learning situations.  We do not all
have the same context or frame of reference therefore learners are
always negotiating "what's real" or applicable for them. Unfortunately
the K-12 system doesn't facilitate this kind of process and many
learners shut down because they just can't reconcile all of the
inconsistencies. Down the road, many of these learners come into our
programs and they continue to feel detached from material. 

 

The "learner biography" process gives learners the time and space to
look at all of those earlier learning experiences, and to search for
significant themes that have emerged from these experiences.  It is a
very powerful process and having gone through this myself in graduate
school, I know that the outcome can be quite significant.  I would be
willing to be involved in a research project that could look more
closely at this process for basic literacy learners if there is an
opportunity to support this kind of research.  What do others think?

Esther

Andres, 
 
I just can't express how encouraging it is to hear that this project is
continuing.  For all of us in the adult education community, it is a joy to
know that such a collaboration is possible.  I know that I am straying from
the topic of "individualized approach," but I think it is important to
emphasize this success story.  The college and the community have joined to
support a project where individual learners also have a stake in a public
product.  In the process each contributor shares cultural specifics, but
also illuminates personal struggle, which is common to us all.  I want to
jump up and scream about how great this is.
 
It would probably work best as a new discussion thread, but I think many
people would like to know more about these personal successes and what was
needed to make each of them work.

We have classes for migrant workers. Last year we started to have them write
their own stories which we published. You can see them at
http:bordersenses.com/memorias.

It was an incredible project. Some students had very limited literacy. One
woman only had 2nd grade education from Mexico, and she earned her GED. She
became a published author together with many other students. 

 

We are about to publish the second issue of memorias. If we get some of the
funding that we are expecting, we will continue to do this. Publishing
student stories is a powerful motivational tool for the entire family.

Esther,

I have a great interest in reflection and use reflective practice with the
teachers I train.  In the past, I have also asked English Language Learners
to do reflective tasks, such as writing their history of learning English.
What guiding questions have you used in your "learner biography"?

Katrina and all,

I was looking over the discussion and noticed your comment about learners
coming away from experiences with a sense of "ownership" of the material.
This I believe is very significant, but is difficult to create or hold the
space for unless instructors are open to the negotiation process that occur
in learning situations.  We do not all have the same context or frame of
reference therefore learners are always negotiating "what's real" or
applicable for them. Unfortunately the K-12 system doesn't facilitate this
kind of process and many learners shut down because they just can't
reconcile all of the inconsistencies. Down the road, many of these learners
come into our programs and they continue to feel detached from material. 

 

The "learner biography" process gives learners the time and space to look at
all of those earlier learning experiences, and to search for significant
themes that have emerged from these experiences.  It is a very powerful
process and having gone through this myself in graduate school, I know that
the outcome can be quite significant.  I would be willing to be involved in
a research project that could look more closely at this process for basic
literacy learners if there is an opportunity to support this kind of
research.  What do others think?

Esther

Good idea, David,

I think it would be great to hear from others who have done similar
projects, so here's the thread! And you talk about how this was a
collaboration between the college and the community. Can you tell us
about how this collaboration worked? Andres, you too.

Well, I agree with Andres.  Publishing student wortk is powerful. Not
only for the learner but for the teacher as well. Below are few sites
teachers and students have worked on under the auspices of World
Education with a grant from NIFL. Teachers from Connecticut and Vermont
participated in workshops covering best practices for project-based
activities using the Web and the basics of designing a Web site.
Teachers then returned to their classes to see what interests students
had and involved them where possible in the creation of websites. Mind
you, these were on free hosting sites so they are not free of banners
and so nowhere near as beautiful as Memorias del Silencio, but the
content is wonderful and shows a great first effort by teachers.

Esther,
I appreciate your response and hope to use this process with our  
intermediate and advanced ESOL students as well as our ABE  
learners.    We have few ABE students and they work one-on-one with  
tutors, but I want to introduce this idea to tutors.  I can see  
having a workshop with tutors and students where we all explore this  
together!

Thank you,

Message-ID: <s4c0ac6c.066@mail.jsi.com>

Has anyone else out there used the kind of learner biography process
that Esther describes as a way to explore past learning experiences? 

Valley talked of training tutors to use this approach...has anyone done
a training in this approach?

Esther and all, after the writing, how do you process the past
experiences to connect them to the here-and-now? How does the past guide
the learner's present and future learning experience?

Julie

***********************************
I'm sorry for such a delayed reply to Valley's email but my email set-up
changed and there was a delay in the postings to me. In answer to your
question about "reflection questions" used in the process. THe learner
biography process starts in group format (orally) with discussion about
early learning experiences. THe exchange is quite open ended with
freedom to talk about both formal and informal types of learning
experiences. It then moves into a more formal stage of the process,
which is the writing part. Once the group (inclusive of the learner) has
identified one or more pervasive theme/s the learner can begin to write
his/her story as it relates to theme identified. It is in the writing
that the learner gains both the awareness and distance to see the ways
in which his/her identity as a learner had been shaped by those
experiences. I may or may not have answered your question directly but
you can find more information about this process in "learning from our
live! s" by Pierre Dominice. If you do decide to facilitate this
process, I would love to hear more about your experiences, and I would
be happy to share more with you off-line.

Colleagues,
 
Next week, Monday July 24 - Friday July 28, we are privileged to have ,  as a guest on the Workplace Literacy Discussion List ,  Alison Campbell of the Conference Board of Canada. Many of you already know of her work, but for those of you who don't, she has 3 websites that I consider sister sites of the Workforce Education site. Where our Workforce site is geared more toward adult education instructors with a workforce focus, her sites are geared more toward business and industry employers who want and/or need to upgrade their workers' literacy skills. The Conference Board is also responsible for quite a lot of good research which Alison has been a part of. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Bio
Alison Campbell
       

Alison Campbell is a Senior Research Associate with the Education and Learning practice at The Conference Board of Canada. She acts as lead researcher, author and web site manager on various research projects in the area of workplace education and learning. This year, Alison is also managing the Conference Board?s International Workplace Education and Learning Conference: Sharing Global Solutions (Toronto, December 5-6, 2006).

 

In 2005, Alison authored Profiting from Literacy: Creating a Sustainable Workplace Literacy Program and co-authored Literacy, Life and Employment: An Analysis of Canadian International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) Microdata. In 2003, Alison authored Strength from Within: Overcoming the Barriers to Workplace Literacy Development as part of a national research study on the challenges employers face in designing and implementing workplace literacy and basic skills programs. In 2002, she co-managed a national study in the U.S. on the impacts of joint labor-management education programs. She co-authored the final report: Success by Design: What Works in Workforce Development. Alison currently manages a pilot project on the benefits of a national credit review service to improve credentialing opportunities for workplace education. 

 

Her work on workplace literacy and basic skills development extends beyond Canada to the United States. Alison manages and makes updates to www.work-basedlearning.org, www.scorecardforskills.com and www.workplacebasicskills.com * a suite of web sites funded by the U.S. Department of Education that act as free resources to American employers and their partners who wish to improve employees? skills.

 

 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

As you can tell from her bio, Alison has expertise in many areas of workplace literacy.  Attached to this message is a complete listing of her publications and presentations, which are available for free download on the Conference Board site.  You must, however, register with the site to access them. (Sign in at http://www.conferenceboard.ca/boardwiseii/Signin.asp and when you have the option, browse documents by "author" choosing "Campbell, Alison.")  Access to the web sites does not require registration, and they are linked in her bio above. Alison is willing to discuss with us any of the areas of workplace literacy on her web sites or in her publications. It should be a wide-ranging discussion!  I hope you will be able to participate!

Hi,
As I was thinking about how to train tutors to do this, I thought one  
of the best ways would be to guide them through the same experience.   
I used to ask tutors to write about a learning experience and we  
would identify what helped and what hindered that person's learning.   
I can see expanding this in the way that Esther talks about below.  I  
think it also would be useful to offer our ELL students, who speak  
Spanish, a chance to write about this in their native language.

Has anyone tried to use this process when working in the student's  
native language?

Valley, I believe writing in the student's native language was 
addressed in an issue of TESOL Matters last year sometime.  Look 
through their archives-- I could be having a senior moment and it was 
FOB, but I don't think so.  It is a WONDERFUL idea.  I am really 
entranced with this idea in any form, but for ELL's it would be 
especially positive.  The article, as I remember,  actually talked 
about having  ELL's write about something meaningful in their native 
language to help them feel less helpless as learners.  Then the 
suggestion was to begin to help them acquire the English to be able to 
speak or write about what they wrote about in their language.   I was 
struck by how respectful that process would be of learners who are 
often regarded as unable to express themselves about anything.

This Learner biography is something I will be anxious to pursue when I 
get a chance.

Hi,As I was thinking about how to train tutors to do this, I thought 
one of the best ways would be to guide them through the same 
experience.? I used to ask tutors to write about a learning experience 
and we would identify what helped and what hindered that person's 
learning.? I can see expanding this in the way that Esther talks about 
below.? I think it also would be useful to offer our ELL students, who

Hi Everyone,
Since we generally identify learning and growth in terms of change, the 
learner biography process through discussion, and writing, help 
learners to gain more insight into behavior patterns that have kept 
them from moving forward as well as the freedom to bring about change 
and growth. For example, if in the process you discover that early 
experiences in learning spurned exploration or investigation, the 
result would be a learner identity that would be reticent to reach out 
and ask questions. I might add that not all experiences that learners 
recall are from formal learning but informal experiences as well. 
Consequently many ABE learners come to classes with a distorted image 
of themselves as learners. They carry with them past experiences and 
knowledge from those experiences that keep them from active 
participation in their own learning as well as the power to contribute 
to other ways of knowing. And so the result for many learners is lack 
of persistence. Many commun! ity colleges have in place a "student 
success seminar" that highlights ways in which "at risk" students can 
learn about successful learning behavior patterns. This is only part of 
what is needed for many learners. THe approach needs to be centered 
around the learner and his/her experiences and ways in which learners 
can themselves "re-story" or reframe those experiences to reflect a 
more positive change in future learning. They key is in the restorying 
of the experiences. Instead of coming away feeling inadequate or 
deficient, we come away with a larger understanding of covert forces 
that help shape our identities.
I would be interested to hear what others think. thanks, Esther

Esther and all, after the writing, how do you process the past

***********************************

I'm sorry for such a delayed reply to Valley's email but my email 
set-up

changed and there was a delay in the postings to me. In answer to your

question about "reflection questions" used in the process. THe learner

biography process starts in group format (orally) with discussion about

early learning experiences. THe exchange is quite open ended with

freedom to talk about both formal and informal types of learning

experiences. It then moves into a more formal stage of the process,

which is the writing part. Once the group (inclusive of the learner) 
has

identified one or more pervasive theme/s the learner can begin to write

his/her story as it relates to theme identified. It is in the writing

that the learner gains both the awareness and distance to see the ways

in which his/her identity as a learner had been shaped by those

experiences. I may or may not have answered your question directly but

you can find more information about this process in "learning from our

live! s" by Pierre Dominice. If you do decide to facilitate this

process, I would love to hear more about your experiences, and I would

be happy to share more with you off-line.

Sorry - a bit late on my response to this thread. For the past nine years we
have published student authors in a book titled _Beginnings_. Students in
adult literacy programs send us their writing, a group of teachers and
students rate these pieces of writing using a rubric, the pieces that score
high enough are published in _Beginnings_. In the spring we have a
conference/celebration for the published student authors where they listen
to authors (we've had Brandon Marie Miller and Angela Johnson), eat a lavish
lunch, receive tons of recognition, and have the chance to read their piece
to the other authors and their guests. This is definitely a "wow" project
for all involved. The _Beginnigs_ books are also on line at

Hi, Dianna,

Your response came right on time for me, as I will be
working in a new literacy program starting this fall. 
I am wondering, would it be possible for you to share
the rubric that you use to evaluate the pieces
submitted by the student authors?  I think the staff
and students at my center would be very receptive to
this kind of endeavor.
Thank you.

Hi Beth,
I would be happy to share the rubric we use to evaluate the _Beginnings_
submissions. We use a likert scale from 1 to 5 with 5 being the best. The
questions on the rubric are:
1. How clear is the content (message) of the writing?
2. Is the organization/structure of the writing acceptable?
3. How creative or original is the piece of writing? Does it interest the
reader?
4. Are mechanical errors (spelling, grammar, punctuation, and
capitalization) prevalent in the piece of writing? That is, do they get in
the way of the writing's meaning?
5. Overall, how would you rate this piece of writing?
We also leave room for comments.
If you have more questions let me know either on or off list.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 456]  Student stories and learner biographies
Message-ID: <s4cf40ba.050@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Folks,

Here are some links to FOB articles that relate to the practice of
having students write memorias, as well as the more specific practice of
processing their written accounts of learning experiences in order to
adopt better learning strategies.

Rediscovering Themselves: Learning to Read for Survival
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=458
This describes a process of taking learners through life reflection that
could be done with a focus on their learning history, as Esther
describes.

How I Wish I was Taught to Write
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=340
One learner-turned-teacher describes what she learned from reviewing her
learning history.

"I Can't Learn This!" An MI Route Around Resistance
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=372
How multiple intelligences theory can help adjust teaching strategies to
fit with indidvidual learning styles.

Understanding Multiple Intelligences: Understanding the Theory Behind
the Practice
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=373
Describes the theory of multiple intelligenges.

It seems to me that the theory of multiple intelligences could be
helpful in the learner bigraphy process, because it offers an
explanation of why certain learning experiences have or have not worked
for certain individuals. It also shows what kind of teaching styles
could be a better fit for certain learners. What do you all think?

Discussion List (http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Contentstandards)


************************************

Since its inception, CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment
System) has focused on teaching and assessing basic skills in contexts
that are relevant and important to adult learners. CASAS has developed
and continues to refine a highly formalized hierarchy of competencies,
the application of basic skills that adults need to be fully functional
and productive members of society. 

In the past few years, at the request of the CASAS National Consortium,
representing approximately 30 states, CASAS has begun development of
basic skills content standards as a formal part of the CASAS system.
This enhancement of the CASAS system is intended to assist and encourage
teachers to more fully integrate basic skills content standards and
functional competencies in instruction.

The basic skills content standards for Reading and Listening contain
simple, clearly stated, detailed statements that are leveled according
to the NRS Educational Functioning Levels, and are also related to CASAS
test items in several CASAS test series. The statements are divided into
Categories to assist teachers to navigate through the standards. 

In the past two years, CASAS has worked with Iowa and California to
pilot these standards with teachers in a variety of adult education
programs. A number of useful teacher worksheets and other tools have
emerged from these efforts.

We invite you to learn more about the CASAS basic skills Content
Standards Project and to ask questions about it during the listserv
discussion next week. To prepare for this discussion, we refer you to
the CASAS website where you will find more detailed information about
the development of the standards, the standards themselves, worksheets
for teachers, and information about the pilot project in Iowa. Go to
http://www.casas.org/DirctDwnlds.cfm?mfile_id=4504&selected_id=1720&wtar

We look forward to engaging with you in this discussion next week.

Here's a great opportunity for your students to expand their horizons by
having contact with other adult learners in other countries.  Check out
the projects from previous years to understand better what it is all

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The International Classroom and School Virtual Visit (Virtual School)
project is beginning its eighth year, linking classrooms across the
world to enable students to meet each other virtually, share information
about their cultures, their classrooms, and their communities, and to
build cultural understanding. Classes can include English as a Second or
Other Language (ESOL/ESL), Adult Basic Education (ABE, GED),  elementary
or secondary education, or family literacy.  Students can be from age
seven to adult.

As in past years, we hope classes will engage in lively written
discussion, and possibly choose a film, book or current event to
discuss. This year we have set up a free wiki, so classes don't have to
create their own web pages, and we will help teachers to use free
Internet telephony so their classes can talk to each other if they can
find a time that works to do that.

If you would like to participate in this year's project,

1. Sign up on the I.C.V.V. e-list  by going to:

        http://lists.literacytent.org/mailman/listinfo/icvv

        Scroll down the page to choose an ID and password.  That's it,
easy and free.

2. Once you receive confirmation that you are on the I.C.V.V. e-list,
send an e-mail to:

          icvv at lists.literacytent.org

indicating your interest in participating this year.  Be sure to
describe your class, when it will begin, and what age group or
nationality you would prefer to partner with.

If you would like to look at classroom virtual visit projects from
previous years go to:

The following announcement of a new special topics discussion is posted
at the request of David Rosen, the moderator.
Donna Brian

-------

Colleagues,

In preparation for celebrating International Literacy Day, on September
5th-7th the Special Topics Discussion List is pleased to welcome  Ms.
Janet Looney representing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development(OECD).  Janet is the leader of the Centre for Educational
Research and Innovation program known as What Works in Innovation in
Education. Its current focus is formative assessment.  The discussion
will serve to introduce some of OECD's work in international education.
The primary focus of the discussion will be on the value of formative
assessment for promoting higher levels of learner achievement, greater
equity of outcomes, and the development of "learning to learn" skills.

Not a term widely known in the U.S., formative assessment refers to what
teachers and learners do in the classroom to assess learning progress.
An assessment is _formative_ when information gathered in the assessment
process is used to modify teaching and learning activities.  It's an
assessment _for_ learning  not just _of_ learning.

Between 2002 and 2004, the What Works program explored formative
assessment in lower secondary classrooms in eight international systems
[see Formative Assessment: Improving Learning in Secondary Classrooms
(2005)].  OECD will publish a second study addressing formative
assessment for adult basic skill learners in 2007.

Together, the two studies are intended to strengthen understanding of
effective approaches to lifelong learning.

FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IN LOWER SECONDARY SCHOOLS

While many teachers incorporate aspects of formative assessment into
their teaching, it is not often practiced systematically.  The What
Works study, Formative Assessment: Improving Learning in Secondary
Classrooms (2005), features exemplary cases from secondary schools in
eight systems and international research reviews, and relates these to
the broader policy environment.  The study shows how teachers have
addressed barriers to systematic practice, and how school and policy
leaders may apply the principles of formative assessment to promote
constructive cultures of assessment and evaluation throughout education
systems.

FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IN ADULT BASIC SKILL PROGRAMS

Formative approaches may be particularly appropriate for adults with  
basic skill needs, the focus of the current What Works study.   
Instructors using formative approaches are able to tailor instruction
more closely to the needs of diverse adult learners.  Formative
approaches also place an explicit focus on identifying and building upon
learners' prior knowledge and skills - whether gained in formal
education settings, or informal work or other settings.

The OECD study on "Improving Teaching and Learning for Adults with Basic
Skill Needs through Formative Assessment" , now underway, is:

1. Developing studies of exemplary teaching and assessment practice for
adults with basic skill needs 2. Bringing together international
scholarship on teaching and assessment for adults with basic skill needs
3. Identifying effective policy levers for improving the quality of
provision in the adult basic skills sector, and 4. Creating
opportunities for policy officials, researchers and practitioners to
exchange insights and ideas on promoting effective teaching, assessment
and evaluation.

We look forward to your subscribing to this three-day discussion.  To do

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 468] National Institute for Literacy Launches
	International Perspective Webpages
Message-ID: <CB4082E7B582144084C72EC6C98D4959118895CD@wdcrobe2m04.ed.gov>

Just in time for International Literacy Day on September 8, the National
Institute for Literacy has launched a series of webpages on its website
(www.nifl.gov) to highlight worldwide efforts to address and combat literacy
problems. The International Perspectives webpages allow American adult
literacy and English language teachers and students quick access to
information about:
	*	adult literacy education in other countries and cultures,
including both developing and industrialized countries, and including
curriculum and outcomes standards for adult education in other countries 
	*	international comparative studies of adult literacy and
PreK-12 education, and 
	*	international efforts to raise literacy levels (e.g.UNESCO,
International Reading Association, and the Venezuelan and Argentinian
literacy campaigns) 
The Institute plans to continue to build on the information on the
International Perspective pages
(<http://www.nifl.gov/nifl/international/intro.html>) as they develop into a
central site for worldwide literacy resources.
	The National Institute for Literacy provides leadership on literacy
issues, including the improvement of reading instruction for children,
youth, and adults. In consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education,
Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Institute serves as a national
resource on current, comprehensive literacy research, practice, and policy.

The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results from the 2003 National
Assessment of Adult Literacy (9/6/2006) 

Results from the Health Literacy component of the 2003 National Assessment
of Adult Literacy (NAAL) were just released. The health literacy findings
are based on the first large-scale national assessment designed specifically
to measure the health literacy of adults living in America. This report
measures health literacy among American adults including their ability to
read, understand, and apply health-related information in English. 

Findings include:
*	The majority of American adults (53 percent) had Intermediate health
literacy. Fewer than 15 percent of adults had either Below Basic or
Proficient health literacy. 
*	Women had higher average health literacy than men. 
*	Adults who were ages 65 and older had lower average health literacy
than younger adults. 
*	Hispanic adults had lower average health literacy than adults in any
other racial/ethnic group.

educational backgrounds. Some have earned graduate degrees, while others
have had little or no access to education. Their goals and expectations
for future education and employment are also diverse. 
 
This CAELA brief focuses on transitions from adult ESL programs
postsecondary education. For a discussion of classroom-level (e.g., how
to develop vocabulary needed for academic classes, types of reading to
do in class, etc.) and programmatic (e.g., orientation needed,

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 473] Starts today: Discussion on ELL in the workplace
Message-ID: <s50e832f.049@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm sorry for the late notice, but there is a joint discussion starting today on the Workplace and ELL Discussion lists. You can join either list to participate. Please read the information below if you are interested.

Julie
*****************************************************************

Announcing a discussion on ELL in the workplace!

 One issue that has been of interest on the Workplace Literacy Discussion List has been serving the needs and goals of employers while at the same time serving the needs of adult immigrants on the job and in their lives. On the Adult English Language Discussion List, issues related to workplace and adult English language learners have been discussed for many years. Workplace ESOL classes are not new, but, as more workplaces throughout the country hire immigrants who may not be proficient in English, new teachers come on board and new needs (and funding sources) arise. New questions also arise.  

We have home-grown expertise on both the Workplace and ELL Discussion Lists. Subscribers on both lists have been involved in managing state and federal workplace grants, developing curricula and materials, teaching or training other teachers in workplace contexts.  We could all learn a lot from sharing questions and experiences.    Lynda Terrill, moderator of the English Language Learner Discussion List and  Donna Brian, moderator of the Workplace Literacy Discussion List,  invite you to  access this combined expertise in a cross-list discussion: a focused, simultaneous, shared discussion on both lists on issues related to the workplace and adult immigrants.  We hope that you will  join us in sharing  philosophies, approaches, and techniques*lessons learned*with each other in a week long dialogue combining the two lists. We have set next week*September 18-22*as the time scheduled for this shared discussion to take place. 

Discussion Questions
Some important questions we hope may be addressed in the discussion are: 

What are effective ways of planning, implementing, and evaluating (adult ESL) workplace classes? 
What types of workplace classes have proven most effective and why? 
How can teachers and administrators develop curricula and materials that meet the needs and goals of the learners in class as well as the needs and expectations of employers? 
What are effective and appropriate approaches for teaching issues related to culture, civil rights, and responsibilities on the job? 
Background Reading and Resources 

Below is a small sample of the best available materials we know of. We hope subscribers will suggest others that have been useful to them:

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 474] The Adult Literacy Education (ALE) Wiki - A
	Community of	Practice for us all
Message-ID: <s50e8839.008@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

I am passing on this information about the ALE Wiki for those of you who
have not yet checked it out. Please read the message below from David
Rosen, organizer of the Wiki, and take a look at the Wiki!

All the best,
Julie
**********************************************************

Colleagues,

The Adult Literacy Education Wiki (now with over 750 pages and nearly  
700 registered users) is becoming a very useful resource for teachers  
and other practitioners in adult literacy education.  It includes 30  
topics linking research, professional wisdom, and practice.  It  
offers easy-to-read archived discussions that were held on this and  
other discussion lists, links to research and other resources,  
questions (and sometimes answers) from teachers and other  
practitioners and researchers, a comprehensive adult literacy  
glossary, and more.  It's free, and it's designed for you.  Best of  
all, it's not only a set of informative web pages.  It's a community  
of practice.  You -- and your colleagues -- can easily add to and  
improve it. It's a wiki!

To check out the ALE wiki, go to:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Main_Page

You will see that some ALE topics need to be nurtured, and to grow.  
They need a Topic Leader.  Perhaps you would be the right person to  
be a Topic Leader. To see a list of topics and leaders, go to

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Topic_Leaders

If you are interested in being a (volunteer) Topic Leader for an  
existing topic, or if you would like to help develop a new topic, e- 
mail me and tell me about yourself and your interest.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 475] Discussion on Special Topics List about
	Corrections Education
Message-ID: <s50e8924.076@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Again,

There is a discussion starting today about corrections education on the
Special Topics Discussion List. Please read on if you are interested in
joining it.

Sorry again for the late notice!

Julie
*************************

Dear Colleagues,

Beginning today, on the Special Topics Discussion List, we are  
pleased to have a panel of expert guests in corrections education.  
The topic will focus on research and professional wisdom in  
corrections family literacy, and on the transition from corrections  
education to community education for inmates who have been released.

Our guests are:

John Linton, Correctional Education, Office of Safe and Drug Free  
Schools, U.S. Department of Education

John is the program officer for two correctional education grant  
programs ("Lifeskills for State and Local Prisoners" and "Grants to  
States for Workplace and Community Transition Training for  
Incarcerated Youth Offenders") in the Office of Safe and Drug Free  
Schools of the U. S. Department of Education.  John formerly served  
the State of Maryland as the director of adult correctional education  
programs.  He has been with the federal agency since 2001, originally
with the Office of Vocational and Adult Education.

Stephen J. Steurer, Ph.D., Executive Director, Correctional Education  
Association. The Correctional Education Association is a professional  
organization
of educators who work in prisons, jails and juvenile settings.

William R. Muth, PhD, Assistant Professor, Reading Education and  
Adult Literacy, Virginia Commonwealth University

Bill is an Assistant Professor of Adult and Adolescent Literacy at  
Virginia Commonwealth University. Until August 2005, he was the  
Education Administrator for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Other  
positions with the FBOP included: reading teacher, principal, and  
Chief of the Program Analysis Branch. In 2004 Bill earned his  
doctorate in adult literacy from George Mason University. His  
dissertation, "Performance and Perspective: Two Assessments of  
Federal Prisoners in Literacy Programs" won the College Reading  
Association's Dissertation of the Year Award. His research interests  
include Thirdspace and Reading Components theories, especially as  
these apply to prison-based family literacy programs and children of  
incarcerated parents.

===========================================

The following readings are recommended by the panelists as background  
for the discussion:

1. "Locked Up and Locked Out, An Educational Perspective on the US  
Prison Population," Coley, Richard J. and Barton, Paul E., 2006
Available on line at the ETS web site:

http://tinyurl.com/qmzfa (short URL)

2. "Learning to Reduce Recidivism: A 50-state analysis of  
postsecondary correctional education policy," Institute for Higher  
Education Policy, Erisman, Wendy and Contardo, Jeanne B., 2005.  
Available on line at the IHEP web site:

http://tinyurl.com/pj2sh (short URL)

3. "Understanding California Corrections" from the California Policy  
Research Center, U of C. (Chapter 4)
http://www.ucop.edu/cprc/documents/understand_ca_corrections.pdf

John Linton believes that California is a watershed state in  
corrections issues and policies , and that how things unfold there  
has great national significance.  He says that this is a thoughtful  
and well-informed report on the "overview" of the corrections  
situation in California -- including the role of treatment programs.
Education is not presented as a central issue, but it has a place --  
as a piece of a bigger puzzle.

4. An article by Bill Muth in Exploring Adult Literacy can be found at

The article contains other on-line links related to prison-based  
intergenerational programs. He recommends especially the link to the

Hi Everyone,

It looks like next week will be abuzz with discussions! Read on for
information about a discussion on the Content Standards List:

Julie

****************************************************************
Greetings colleagues,

Next week, Monday, September 25 through Friday, September 29, the
Content Standards Discussion List will be hosting a discussion on the
U.S. Department of Education's efforts to support state-level adoption
and institutionalization of content standards for adult learning.  Our
guest will be Ronna Spacone from the Department's Office of Vocational
and Adult Education (OVAE), Division of Adult Education and Literacy
(DAEL).

Please read the introductory information below, which includes a link to
the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse Website, to help prepare
you for the discussion.  

You may begin posting your questions to Ronna this week.  I will collect
the questions together and re-post when the discussion starts next week.

Moderator, National Institute for Literacy's Content  
Discussion List (http://www.nifl.gov/mailman/listinfo/Contentstandards)

********************************************************************************************
For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Education, OVAE, has
used National Leadership Activity funds to provide technical assistance
and support to states already committed to standards-based education
reform.  

OVAE's efforts to promote the implementation of state-level content
standards began with the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse
Project, operated by the American Institutes of Research (AIR),
2003-2005.  The project included:

Technical assistance and networking for state collaborative working
groups or consortia in 14 states,
 
The development and publication of "A Process Guide for Establishing
State Adult Education Content Standards" and
 
The development of the Adult Education Content Standards Warehouse
(AECSW) Website.  The AECSW site provides universal access to existing
state standards as well as nationally developed content standards in the
areas of reading, mathematics, and English language acquisition.  Since
it was launched in May 2005, eleven states and CASAS and Equipped for
the Future have contributed their standards for posting.  The site also
serves to disseminate the "Process Guide for Establishing State Adult
Education Content Standards" as well as the professional development
materials that were developed for the State Standards Consortia project.
 In preparation for our listserv discussion next week, I invite you to
please visit the AECSW Website located at:
(http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org), which AIR continues to operate
with OVAE. 
 
In September 2005, with the conclusion of the State Standards Consortia
activities, OVAE funded a new activity to identify how best to continue
to support states committed to the implementation of standards.  A
six-month planning project was then conducted by MPR Associates, Inc.,
along with partner organizations Design Perspectives and World
Education.  Planning activities included a literature review of
noteworthy practices, an evaluation of the electronic warehouse, and an
assessment of the needs of states to support standards-based education. 
Twenty-four states chose to participate in the project.  Based on the
results, OVAE has moved ahead and made plans for a new project scheduled
to begin next month.

As in the past, the new activities will provide opportunities for
interested states to work together and learn about standards-based
education.  The project is expected to focus especially on the
implementation of standards, including: how to translate standards into
classroom instruction and curriculum and how to assess the
implementation of standards to guide instructional improvement and
program practice. 

I invite you to learn more about the Department of Education's efforts
to promote state-level adoption of content standards and to ask
questions about these activities during the listserv discussion.  Please
refer to the various sections of the AECSW Website
(http://www.adultedcontentstandards.org) including the Guide, Warehouse,
and Field Resources as well as the OVAE DAEL Website located at:
(http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/index.html). 

I look forward to an interesting, engaging discussion and appreciate the
opportunity to take part.  Thanks.

	or Reality?"
Message-ID: <s5118dbe.005@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

Our discussion on the FOB article "Low Self-Esteem: Myth or Reality?"
will be next week, September 25-29. See below for some questions to
think about. 

Link to the article (in Volume 8B)
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1105 

Discussion Questions for "Low Self-Esteem: Myth or Reality?

1.  How much do you and your programs presume low self-esteem among your
learners? 
2.  How do you think this presumption affects the delivery of education
to adult learners? 
3.  The findings of this study may conflict with some people's notions
of adult learners. How does this article affect your thoughts about the
self-esteem of learners in your program?
4.  How might you adjust your teaching or delivery of services if your
learners had a higher self-esteem than you thought?
5.  There was some discussion of science's ability to "understand the
human mind", and of the validity of research on a concept such as
self-esteem. It is a broad and variably-defined concept, which may be
affected by many external factors related to one's situation in life.
How do we, as consumers of research, handle this question? 

I hope you can join us!

Julie

multiple copies of one post - this is called "cross-posting." We do this to
ensure that the maximum number of subscribers receives the messages -
usually an announcement that may be of interest to subscribers on more than
one list. While this can be cumbersome, this is done to ensure that you, our
subscribers, are kept up-to-date on the latest news, guest speakers, etc.

Here are a few tips to help you manage the number of repeat emails into your
inbox.

	1)	Change your subscriber settings to receive postings in
digest format. 
	2)	Disable mail delivery from the lists while you are away. You
still remain subscribed to the list, but will not receive postings while you
are away. When you return, you can review the archives for posts that you
missed while you were away.
	3)	You do not have to subscribe to a list to benefit from a
discussion. Discussions are archived at the Institute's website and can be
sorted by thread, date, and author, and can also be searched by keyword.
	4)	When sending a message to multiple lists, start with
CROSS-POSTED in the subject line, so that other subscribers can recognize
that it is a cross-post that they may have already received.

Hi, I read the article and I have problems with it and on how the
question about self esteem was explored. The issue of self esteem is
hard to measure as an independent variable and compare it to another
controlled group. 

The concept of self esteem is historically rooted in the ideas of the
enlightenment and economic ideals of capitalism. Hume has defined us as
Homo-Economicus, as men whose worth is measured by wealth. This was a
shift from the idea that the worth of a man was inherited as it was
previously believed. 

In modern society there are markers that define the esteem of a person.
These are usually wealth, looks, possessions, titles, job status,
cultural capital, etc. These are things that we all use to measure our
value and based on these, we evaluate ourselves. 

Usually, our students are in the low end of the scale in terms of these
measures. There are other things that societies can consider in terms of
valuing a person's esteem. Unfortunately, ours has identified the above
markers. We need to recognize and struggle to challenge this. However,
if a study tells us that there are no self esteem problems among the
poor, the oppressed, or those with limited academic skills then we won't
need to challenge our cultural views on self esteem.

Problem with measuring self esteem as an empirically independent
variable that can be isolated, is that it is not an empirical or
observable variable that can be isolated. Self esteem is tied to our
habitus and as such, it needs to be understood and researched within the
context of our habitus. Moreover, a concept such as self esteem is not
an isolatable concept with life of its own. It is a contextual mental
construct that defines the mental state of a person within specific
social, cultural and historical contexts. Blah, blah, blah, blah.....

I read your article, and it is very interesting.  I wonder if the numbers might be different if the students were polled in correctional education programs.  Perhaps, these students DO have lower levels of self esteem - which also might have impacted their criminal behavior.
Just a thought...
Might it be another researt project.. and if it is found that a large group of the students DO have low self esteem, how might teachers influence that issue.

Hello, All:

With great interest I am reading and learning from the postings, including Ms. Lipnevich, regarding the community's perception of the relationship of self-esteem to literacy.  I would like to add my own experience.  For many years I have worked as a teacher, tutor, and advocate with people of all ages and backgrounds, in groups and in individual consultation, who are struggling in some way with issues of literacy.  Sometimes they are new arrivals to the USA, with English language skills ranging from emergent through expert.  At other times they are long time residents or citizens of this country, and again with varying degrees of American English language accomplishment.  And sometimes they are native-born Americans, who struggle with our language in some way, from the basics to a more advanced understanding.  From the onset of this work it was my idea that there was a direct relationship between self-esteem and literacy.

During my years in graduate school, I remained interested in the relationship between self-esteem and literacy, yet found in my research and that of others that opinions regarding this relationship widely varied. Nevertheless, from my own ongoing work including my final research and dissertation I found again that there was a direct relationship between self-esteem and literacy, and that this relationship existed across all populations, cultures, and ages.

Now, as a practicing cognitive psychologist and educator, and as a life and career management services consultant, with more experienced and education gained, I have found no instance where these two variables are not present in some critical relationship, at least to some degree.  The evidence of this relationship presents in a variety of forms, and with a variety of forces: economic, social, political, cultural, and so on.  The presentation may be explicit, in that my client(s) tell me and demonstrate that they have low self esteem, or implicit, but there is, in my opinion, always evidence for this relationship. The evidence also takes many forms, but most simply can be seen in their change of self-perspective as they improve their communication and English language skills and go on to accomplish their goals.  The model that I have established for my practice is also based to some degree on this idea: that there is a direct relationship between self-esteem and literacy.  

Low literacy denies to people of all ages and backgrounds many aspects of life and career management.  Moderate-to-high literacy allows people to negotiate American society's processes and institutions with at least some quantifiable measure of success.  Are there other variables that assist in determining life and career success?  Of course, and they are integrated into my own practice, and reviewed in my other professiorial activities.  But the relationship does exist, and occurs in my experience with many people over many years.

Thanks for providing this forum. I enjoy the discussions and hope to hear from anyone interested.

  Subject: [FocusOnBasics 480] Low Self-esteem: Myth or Reality?


  Dear All,

  First of all, I would like to thank everyone for very insightful comments concerning issues addressed in the article. I was very pleased that my work sparked such a lively discussion. As I noted in the paper, I did expect some skepticism since the findings run counter to what seems to be a commonly accepted belief in the field. I will try to dissolve it to the best of my ability; it is not my main goal, however.  Let me quickly describe the premises of the research and what these findings mean to me. 

   Since my very first encounter with the adult literacy literature, I noticed that many writers had described adult basic education learners as having detrimentally low self esteem. Similarly, many researchers showed that teachers saw their role as that of raising students self esteem. Being a student in an educational psychology program with a heavy emphasis on statistics, I always seek empirical evidence for every claim made. In the case of adult literacy students' low self esteem, I found none. Therefore, I suggested conducting a study that would shed some light on the matter. This study was going to be a part of a larger study, so it was decided to administer a self-esteem questionnaire along with other measures. 

   I agree with those of you who pointed at the possible flaws of the self-report. Ideally, I would back up my findings with other methods (e.g. interviews, observations). In case converging results are found, such triangulation would solidify my conclusions. I haven't gotten to it quite yet. However, careful construction of the questionnaire under the supervision of savvy adult education researchers and good psychometric characteristics of the measure suggest that this way of measuring self-esteem is at the very least acceptable. Students seem to have provided meaningful answers to the questions. 

   I do agree that self-esteem is influenced by many variables, e.g. economic status. This is an important factor to consider, but it doesn't change the way we interpret the findings. In psychological research, we measure self-esteem, motivation, self-regulation and what not, keeping in mind that they do not operate in isolation. However, it does give us useful information about the level of certain phenomena and helps us refine ways we interact with our students. Therefore, I do not necessarily see why difficulty with measuring self-esteem should deter us from doing it.

   For those of you who wondered why PhD students were chosen for comparison, here is my rationale. In the absence of self-esteem norms for the adult students' population, I needed a comparison group. PhD students are similar to adult learners in that they have voluntarily enrolled in their respective educational programs. Even though doctoral students and adult learners are at different educational levels, they had to believe they could succeed when they joined the program and they may have the same doubts about their potential success as they progress in the program. Additionally, societal views on PhD and adult literacy students as being a sea apart on the SE vector served as a good concurrent validity estimate.

   Having found no differences, Hal Beder and I concluded that those who work with adult basic education students should reevaluate any preconceived notions they may have about their students. Adult learners need no more praise than PhD students, and teachers' focus should be on helping learners acquire skills, strategies and knowledge, rather than working on the elusive goal of raising self-esteem. Again, my findings do not mean that adult students have high SE - it means only that they do not differ from PhD students in the levels they have.

   Having said this, I am looking forward to your comments. I will try to address your comments every night - my schedule prevents me from doing it more often. Thank you so much!


  Ana Lipnevich.

Although there may be a relationship between 
adult literacy and self-esteem, it is important 
to note that the subjects of the study were adult 
literacy students, a select 
population.  Nationally, only about 8% of those 
eligible for adult literacy attend programs.  It 
may be that low-literates with the lowest self-esteem simply do not attend.

Some comments of what I've noticed in 30 plus years of teaching adults.


1)      Many gang members have noticeable low self esteem

2)      Many people who are incarcerated have low self esteem/self worth
issues

Have you all noticed this?

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 483] Re: Low Self-esteem: Myth or Reality?

 

Hello, All:

 

With great interest I am reading and learning from the postings,
including Ms. Lipnevich, regarding the community's perception of the
relationship of self-esteem to literacy.  I would like to add my own
experience.  For many years I have worked as a teacher, tutor, and
advocate with people of all ages and backgrounds, in groups and in
individual consultation, who are struggling in some way with issues of
literacy.  Sometimes they are new arrivals to the USA, with English
language skills ranging from emergent through expert.  At other times
they are long time residents or citizens of this country, and again with
varying degrees of American English language accomplishment.  And
sometimes they are native-born Americans, who struggle with our language
in some way, from the basics to a more advanced understanding.  From the
onset of this work it was my idea that there was a direct relationship
between self-esteem and literacy.

 

During my years in graduate school, I remained interested in the
relationship between self-esteem and literacy, yet found in my research
and that of others that opinions regarding this relationship widely
varied. Nevertheless, from my own ongoing work including my final
research and dissertation I found again that there was a direct
relationship between self-esteem and literacy, and that this
relationship existed across all populations, cultures, and ages.

 

Now, as a practicing cognitive psychologist and educator, and as a life
and career management services consultant, with more experienced and
education gained, I have found no instance where these two variables are
not present in some critical relationship, at least to some degree.  The
evidence of this relationship presents in a variety of forms, and with a
variety of forces: economic, social, political, cultural, and so on.
The presentation may be explicit, in that my client(s) tell me and
demonstrate that they have low self esteem, or implicit, but there is,
in my opinion, always evidence for this relationship. The evidence also
takes many forms, but most simply can be seen in their change of
self-perspective as they improve their communication and English
language skills and go on to accomplish their goals.  The model that I
have established for my practice is also based to some degree on this
idea: that there is a direct relationship between self-esteem and
literacy.  

 

Low literacy denies to people of all ages and backgrounds many aspects
of life and career management.  Moderate-to-high literacy allows people
to negotiate American society's processes and institutions with at least
some quantifiable measure of success.  Are there other variables that
assist in determining life and career success?  Of course, and they are
integrated into my own practice, and reviewed in my other professiorial
activities.  But the relationship does exist, and occurs in my
experience with many people over many years.

 

Thanks for providing this forum. I enjoy the discussions and hope to
hear from anyone interested.

	Subject: [FocusOnBasics 480] Low Self-esteem: Myth or Reality?

	 

	Dear All,

	First of all, I would like to thank everyone for very insightful
comments concerning issues addressed in the article. I was very pleased
that my work sparked such a lively discussion. As I noted in the paper,
I did expect some skepticism since the findings run counter to what
seems to be a commonly accepted belief in the field. I will try to
dissolve it to the best of my ability; it is not my main goal, however.
Let me quickly describe the premises of the research and what these
findings mean to me. 

	 Since my very first encounter with the adult literacy
literature, I noticed that many writers had described adult basic
education learners as having detrimentally low self esteem. Similarly,
many researchers showed that teachers saw their role as that of raising
students self esteem. Being a student in an educational psychology
program with a heavy emphasis on statistics, I always seek empirical
evidence for every claim made. In the case of adult literacy students'
low self esteem, I found none. Therefore, I suggested conducting a study
that would shed some light on the matter. This study was going to be a
part of a larger study, so it was decided to administer a self-esteem
questionnaire along with other measures. 

	 I agree with those of you who pointed at the possible flaws of
the self-report. Ideally, I would back up my findings with other methods
(e.g. interviews, observations). In case converging results are found,
such triangulation would solidify my conclusions. I haven't gotten to it
quite yet. However, careful construction of the questionnaire under the
supervision of savvy adult education researchers and good psychometric
characteristics of the measure suggest that this way of measuring
self-esteem is at the very least acceptable. Students seem to have
provided meaningful answers to the questions. 

	 I do agree that self-esteem is influenced by many variables,
e.g. economic status. This is an important factor to consider, but it
doesn't change the way we interpret the findings. In psychological
research, we measure self-esteem, motivation, self-regulation and what
not, keeping in mind that they do not operate in isolation. However, it
does give us useful information about the level of certain phenomena and
helps us refine ways we interact with our students. Therefore, I do not
necessarily see why difficulty with measuring self-esteem should deter
us from doing it.

	 For those of you who wondered why PhD students were chosen for
comparison, here is my rationale. In the absence of self-esteem norms
for the adult students' population, I needed a comparison group. PhD
students are similar to adult learners in that they have voluntarily
enrolled in their respective educational programs. Even though doctoral
students and adult learners are at different educational levels, they
had to believe they could succeed when they joined the program and they
may have the same doubts about their potential success as they progress
in the program. Additionally, societal views on PhD and adult literacy
students as being a sea apart on the SE vector served as a good
concurrent validity estimate.

	 Having found no differences, Hal Beder and I concluded that
those who work with adult basic education students should reevaluate any
preconceived notions they may have about their students. Adult learners
need no more praise than PhD students, and teachers' focus should be on
helping learners acquire skills, strategies and knowledge, rather than
working on the elusive goal of raising self-esteem. Again, my findings
do not mean that adult students have high SE - it means only that they
do not differ from PhD students in the levels they have.

	 Having said this, I am looking forward to your comments. I will
try to address your comments every night - my schedule prevents me from
doing it more often. Thank you so much!

	Ana Lipnevich.

Amuro,

	Your brief discussion seems to ring very true to my experience
in
working with a sub-population of the severely emotionally disabled high
school students. I am not working in the education profession at this
time,
but am very interested in this topic.

	If you would be so kind as to send me a bibliography of primary

Hi, I read the article and I have problems with it and on how the
question about self esteem was explored. The issue of self esteem is
hard to measure as an independent variable and compare it to another
controlled group.

The concept of self esteem is historically rooted in the ideas of the
enlightenment and economic ideals of capitalism. Hume has defined us as
Homo-Economicus, as men whose worth is measured by wealth. This was a
shift from the idea that the worth of a man was inherited as it was
previously believed.

In modern society there are markers that define the esteem of a person.
These are usually wealth, looks, possessions, titles, job status,
cultural capital, etc. These are things that we all use to measure our
value and based on these, we evaluate ourselves.

Usually, our students are in the low end of the scale in terms of these
measures. There are other things that societies can consider in terms of
valuing a person's esteem. Unfortunately, ours has identified the above
markers. We need to recognize and struggle to challenge this. However,
if a study tells us that there are no self esteem problems among the
poor, the oppressed, or those with limited academic skills then we won't
need to challenge our cultural views on self esteem.

Problem with measuring self esteem as an empirically independent
variable that can be isolated, is that it is not an empirical or
observable variable that can be isolated. Self esteem is tied to our
habitus and as such, it needs to be understood and researched within the
context of our habitus. Moreover, a concept such as self esteem is not
an isolatable concept with life of its own. It is a contextual mental
construct that defines the mental state of a person within specific
social, cultural and historical contexts. Blah, blah, blah, blah.....

Hi Everyone,

Our discussion on the FOB article "Low Self-Esteem: Myth or Reality?"
will be next week, September 25-29. See below for some questions to
think about.

Link to the article (in Volume 8B)
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1105

Discussion Questions for "Low Self-Esteem: Myth or Reality?

1.  How much do you and your programs presume low self-esteem among your
learners?
2.  How do you think this presumption affects the delivery of education
to adult learners?
3.  The findings of this study may conflict with some people's notions
of adult learners. How does this article affect your thoughts about the
self-esteem of learners in your program?
4.  How might you adjust your teaching or delivery of services if your
learners had a higher self-esteem than you thought?
5.  There was some discussion of science's ability to "understand the
human mind", and of the validity of research on a concept such as
self-esteem. It is a broad and variably-defined concept, which may be
affected by many external factors related to one's situation in life.
How do we, as consumers of research, handle this question?

I hope you can join us!

Hello there 
 
I work in workplace literacy programmes and in professional development with tutors who often describe that their learners have developed 'more confidence or self-esteem' and my question is always how do you know.
Is  it because they can do more or different  things or use or articulate different strategies or do they have different knowledge forms.  In my experience learners are always able to specify what the differences are 
 
NIACE in the UK did a small scale research project on adult learners and confidence which makes interesting reading 
Here is a short summary of the project

Although there may be a relationship between
adult literacy and self-esteem, it is important
to note that the subjects of the study were adult
literacy students, a select
population.  Nationally, only about 8% of those
eligible for adult literacy attend programs.  It
may be that low-literates with the lowest self-esteem simply do not attend.

To support both Virginia's observations, and respond to Gina's question, I
have been a classroom instructor, building principal and assistant
superintendent in a correctional education system for over 30 years.

Low esteem in this population is the norm not the exception. Past failures
in education, the impact of poverty, a fractured home life all contribute to
this issue.

Ruby Payne's work on poverty clearly demonstrates the impact that low self
esteem plays in childhood. At risk youth and adults in our prisons and jails
simply serve to add a pointed commentary to that sad fact.

Judith-- an interesting take on the literacy and self-esteem issue--and 
one I do not think was intended in this discussion.  Literacy in 
English as opposed to no literacy at all are rather different 
situations.  Of course it boosts an English learner's self esteem in 
the language learning and use situation when their English improves, 
but I do not think it is wise to make this analogous to self esteem 
issues of those who have never gained literacy in their native language 
and have remained, perhaps, marginalized as a result.     Robin Lovrien

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 483] Re: Low Self-esteem: Myth or Reality?

Hello, All:
?
With great interest I am reading and learning from the postings, 
including Ms. Lipnevich,?regarding the community's perception of the 
relationship of self-esteem to literacy.? I would like to add my own 
experience.? For many years I have worked as a teacher, tutor, and 
advocate with people of all ages and backgrounds, in groups and in 
individual consultation,?who?are struggling in some way with issues of 
literacy.? Sometimes they?are new arrivals to the USA, with English 
language skills ranging from emergent through expert.? At other times 
they?are long time residents or citizens of this country, and again 
with varying degrees of American English language accomplishment.? And 
sometimes they?are native-born Americans, who struggle with our 
language in some way, from the basics to a more advanced 
understanding.? From the onset of this work it was my idea that there 
was a direct relationship between self-esteem and literacy.
?
During my years in graduate school, I remained interested in the 
relationship between self-esteem and literacy, yet found in my research 
and that of others that opinions regarding this relationship widely 
varied.?Nevertheless, from my own ongoing work including my final 
research and dissertation I found again that?there was?a direct 
relationship between self-esteem and literacy, and that this 
relationship existed across all populations, cultures, and ages.
?
Now,?as a practicing cognitive psychologist and educator, and as a life 
and career management services consultant, with more experienced and 
education gained, I have found no instance where these two 
variables?are not present in some critical relationship, at least to 
some degree.? The evidence of this relationship presents in a variety 
of forms, and with a variety of forces: economic, social, political, 
cultural, and so on.? The presentation may be explicit, in that my 
client(s) tell me and demonstrate that they have low self esteem, or 
implicit, but there is, in my opinion, always evidence for this 
relationship.?The evidence also takes many forms, but most simply can 
be seen in their change of self-perspective as they improve their 
communication and English language skills and go on to accomplish their 
goals.? The model that I have established for my practice is also based 
to some degree on this idea: that there is a direct relationship 
between self-esteem and literacy.?
?
Low literacy denies to people of all ages and backgrounds many aspects 
of life and career management.? Moderate-to-high literacy allows people 
to negotiate American society's processes and institutions with at 
least some quantifiable measure of success.? Are there other variables 
that assist in determining life and career success?? Of course, and 
they are integrated into my own practice, and reviewed in my other 
professiorial activities.? But the relationship does exist, and occurs 
in my experience with many people over many years.
?
Thanks for providing this forum.?I enjoy the discussions and hope to 
hear from anyone interested.

Dear All,
First of all, I would like to thank everyone for very insightful 
comments concerning issues addressed in the article. I was very pleased 
that my work sparked such a lively discussion. As I noted in the paper, 
I did expect some skepticism since the findings run counter to what 
seems to be a commonly accepted belief in the field. I will try to 
dissolve it to the best of my ability; it is not my main goal, however. 
?Let me quickly describe the premises of the research and what these 
findings mean to me.

?Since my very first encounter with the adult literacy literature, I 
noticed that many writers had described adult basic education learners 
as having detrimentally low self esteem. Similarly, many researchers 
showed that teachers saw their role as that of raising students self 
esteem. Being a student in an educational psychology program with a 
heavy emphasis on statistics, I always seek empirical evidence for 
every claim made. In the case of adult literacy students? low self 
esteem, I found none. Therefore, I suggested conducting a study that 
would shed some light on the matter. This study was going to be a part 
of a larger study, so it was decided to administer a self-esteem 
questionnaire along with other measures.

?I agree with those of you who pointed at the possible flaws of the 
self-report. Ideally, I would back up my findings with other methods 
(e.g. interviews, observations). In case converging results are found, 
such triangulation would solidify my conclusions. I haven?t gotten to 
it quite yet. However, careful construction of the questionnaire under 
the supervision of savvy adult education researchers and good 
psychometric characteristics of the measure suggest that this way of 
measuring self-esteem is at the very least acceptable. Students seem to 
have provided meaningful answers to the questions.

?I do agree that self-esteem is influenced by many variables, e.g. 
economic status. This is an important factor to consider, but it 
doesn?t change the way we interpret the findings. In psychological 
research, we measure self-esteem, motivation, self-regulation and what 
not, keeping in mind that they do not operate in isolation. However, it 
does give us useful information about the level of certain phenomena 
and helps us refine ways we interact with our students. Therefore, I do 
not necessarily see why difficulty with measuring self-esteem should 
deter us from doing it.

?For those of you who wondered why PhD students were chosen for 
comparison, here is my rationale. In the absence of self-esteem norms 
for the adult students? population, I needed a comparison group. PhD 
students are similar to adult learners in that they have voluntarily 
enrolled in their respective educational programs. Even though doctoral 
students and adult learners are at different educational levels, they 
had to believe they could succeed when they joined the program and they 
may have the same doubts about their potential success as they progress 
in the program. Additionally, societal views on PhD and adult literacy 
students as being a sea apart on the SE vector served as a good 
concurrent validity estimate.

?Having found no differences, Hal Beder and I concluded that those who 
work with adult basic education students should reevaluate any 
preconceived notions they may have about their students. Adult learners 
need no more praise than PhD students, and teachers? focus should be on 
helping learners acquire skills, strategies and knowledge, rather than 
working on the elusive goal of raising self-esteem. Again, my findings 
do not mean that adult students have high SE ? it means only that they 
do not differ from PhD students in the levels they have.

?Having said this, I am looking forward to your comments. I will try to 
address your comments every night ? my schedule prevents me from doing 
it more often. Thank you so much!


Ana Lipnevich.

This discussion is rich and fascinating. 

I'm very taken with Anastasiya's research, particularly since her findings resonate with much of my classroom experience. Of course, it is only one study and certainly needs to be replicated with similar and different populations to see how robust the findings are. 

In the meantime, I wonder how tied we are as teachers to the idea that our students have low self esteem. What role does that idea have in our views of ourselves as teachers?

Dear All,
?Thank youfor such a great discussion. Below I will try to address some of yourcomments.
__________________

?Andres,
It lookslike we are coming from different research paradigms, and our views onresearchin general and measurement in particular somewhat diverge. Here is mytake onsome of the issues you raised.
1. I haveto disagree with your conceptualization of self-esteem. I believe thatwhat youdescribe is actually socio-economic status (e.g. possessions, wealth,jobstatus), a construct commonly regarded as conceptually different fromself-esteem. There are studies that show a high correlation betweenself-esteemand SES, therefore, the two are, in fact, closely tied. 
Is itreally possible and/or meaningful to tease them apart? I do think so.Scientific method and characteristics thereof drive us towardsconceptualparsimony when operationalizing and actually measuring constructs ofinterest.It doesn?t mean that self esteem (or motivation, or engagement, etc)stand ontheir own. They are closely related to numerous variables, however, acorpus ofliterature demonstrates that attempts to measure them as separateconstructs doyield meaningful results and help advance our understanding of humannature. 
Additionally,what immediately comes to mind is that some components ofsocio-economic status(i.e. financial well-being) of PhD students may be worse than that ofworkingadult literacy students. So, the findings of the present study do notnecessarily contradict your take on the matter.
?
2. Inpsychological research, self-esteem is typically defined in terms ofhow weevaluate ourselves and our characteristics, the "personal judgment ofworthiness that is expressed in the attitudes the individual holdstoward himself,"in the words of Coopersmith, a pioneering researcher in the field. Itis afuzzy construct but a certain consensus has developed. Many seem toagree thatself esteem can be differentiated into global and specific self esteem.Globalrepresents a general attitude towards oneself, and can be considered atraitself-esteem, whereas specific self-esteems concern particular areas ofpeople?slives. 
?Self-affirmation theory (Steel,1988) suggests that people cope with negative outcomes in one domain byfocusing on their achievements in other, unrelated domains. This meansthat individualswith high global self-esteem would feel overall quite competent evenwhen theiracademic self-esteem is low. Low-literate adults who have failedacademicallybut succeed in other aspects of their lives may have a high generalself-esteemthat will allow them to lead full, not deficient, lives. Adult literacylearners often look at themselves as competent workers, parents, andcitizens,which may partially compensate for their lack of literacy. Talkingabout adultliteracy students in terms of their deficiencies and abnormally lowself-esteemjust adds to the existing stigma. 
?3. This study doesn?t suggest thatself-esteem of adult students is high. Rather, that it doesn?t differsignificantly from the self-esteem of the PhD students. Since we don?tconsiderraising self-esteem of the latter group to be our primary goal,focusing onraising self esteem of the former group represents a logical skew withpotential pernicious corollaries, with the most dangerous one being, asHal and Isuggested in our report, that it may strengthen the existing stigma.Self-esteem is crucial for success in academic settings for bothgroups; but perhapsit is best addressed through strong pedagogy by helping studentssucceed intheir academic pursuits. 
?___________________
Gina andVirginia raised a question about self-esteem of learners incorrectionaleducational programs. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with existingliteratureon the matter. However, during my recent presentation at the AERAconference,one of the attendees who teaches in a prison described her students ashavinghigh self-esteem. I cannot judge the validity of her conclusions sincetheywere based solely on her observations; it?s just interesting toconsider.

Thanksagain to everyone ? I am really enjoying this discussion.

This posting has jogged my memory about a study that
was done in Oakland CA with the teachers of Asian
students in Oakland High School.  As I recall,
students from families that were in the higher
socio-economic strata in their country of origin as
well as students from families in the lowest
socio-economic strata, in this case the grave diggers'
families, out performed their fellow students of all
racial backgrounds.  The study concluded this was
largely due to teacher expectation--teachers expected
Asian students to do well in school and interacted
with them accordingly, another factor to consider when
discussing student self esteem.  If I can find the
study, I will share with the discussion group.  I
believe it was conducted by the University of
California, Berkeley.  Bonnita

Hi Ana: Thinking about this issue is going to drive me nuts and keep me
out of my work, but here I go again. You define self -esteem as: 

"In psychological research, self-esteem is typically defined in terms of
how we evaluate ourselves and our characteristics, the personal judgment
of worthiness that is expressed in the attitudes the individual holds
toward himself," in the words of Coopersmith, a pioneering researcher in
the field. It is a fuzzy construct but a certain consensus has
developed. Many seem to agree that self esteem can be differentiated
into global and specific self esteem. Global represents a general
attitude towards oneself, and can be considered a trait self-esteem,
whereas specific self-esteems concern particular areas of people's
lives. "

What I wonder is if this feeling of self-worth is caused by genetics, or
is it caused by certain experiences. It is possible that self esteem is
inherited. If so, then, self esteem reporting, would be similar
regardless of group. However, if the environment has something to do
with self esteem, the question to me would be what factors influence
self-worth. 

If genetics are a predictor of self esteem, and we can identify the gene
that determines self esteem, then there is no reason to work on the self
esteem of the students. It is possible that self esteem can be
associated with dopamine, serotonin activity in the brain and that there
is a gene that influences the presence or absence of these substances.
If such is the case, then, we may be able to prescribe prozac to those
with low self-esteem and, most likely, there is probably something to
this

I assume that most of us believe that there are causes in the
environment that can influence self-worth. For example, there was an in
your face Sprite commercial that used to say "Image is Everything". I
assume that the makers of the commercial believe that people's self
worth has to do with their image and that people would do anything to
improve their image which would lead to an improve self-worth. I am not
sure if this is true or not, but a whole field of advertising has been
developed on this premise. The purpose of advertising is to make people
feel bad about themselves and to feel that they will feel better by
acquiring a given product. In fact, the poor seem to be the biggest
target of predatory type of advertising that banks on their low self
worth. 

>From this I get that while there is not that much direct evidence that
the self worth of the poor is worse than the self worth of the
wealthier, there is indirect evidence. The indirect evidence is the
extent and success of the predatory advertising to make the poor
consumers of things that they do not need, but are marketed as means to
improve their self worth. 

So, if we assume that the environment has something to do with
self-esteem, then I would try to identify the elements in the
environment that influence self esteem. I would hypothesize that self
esteem will increase with the accomplishment of something that I want to
achieve. So, if I achieve something, then I will feel that I fulfill my
goals or I became self actualized, as Maslow articulates. 

I think that the problem rests in the things that will make us feel self
actualized and the difference between what different groups can do to
become self actualized. Ideally, we would have control in the things
that we chose to do. Unfortunately, institutions in the community and
the media shape those choices. In a capitalist community where success
is measured in terms of wealth, the need to show socioeconomic success
has to be important. So, those who determine that they want to succeed
economically will become fulfilled by economic success. Hence, they will
become self-actualized and their perception of themselves, their self
worth will improve. 

At the same time, there are limitations to the things that we can do
that are mediated by economics. If, for example, my kid has a cold, I
may need to take her to the doctor or buy medication. My ability to do
this may very well depend on my economic status. Providing for my child
becomes a way to become self actualized, but the possibility of me
becoming self actualized is tied to my financial situation. The same has
to do with going to school, sending children to school, finding
employment, practicing my art, etc. In our society the means to become
self actualized, even if they are our choices, may be tied to economic
forces. 

Because I don't believe that economic success is an important marker of
self worth, I want to challenge this with my students. But, to do this,
we need to find other makers of success and help them explore these.
These may lead to self actualization and improved self worth. Being a
good mother, helping a friend, writing a story, etc, can be means of
self actualization. However, these models compete with the powerful
advertising and marketing models that plague the lives of most of our
students. But I don't believe that my students' self esteem has been
lowered by society's established markers of self worth and society's
established vehicles for self actualization, then I have no reason to
create alternative models. I think that we all do, and we work on this
which leads to our students becoming self actualized. However, we are
always competing with Walmart. 

There are other issues tied to consciousness of history that Freire
explores that are tied to oppressor/oppressed status, hegemony, etc. I
will not get into them right now. However, I still believe that
self-esteem is something very complex that cannot be looked at as some
isolated independent variable that can be reported.

Bonnita,

This is a really great point. Many of us are familiar with a similar 
study conducted by Rosenthal in 1968 who found that when teachers expect 
students to do well and show intellectual growth, they do; when teachers 
do not have such expectations, performance and growth are not so 
encouraged and may in fact be discouraged in a variety of ways. This is 
one of the reasons why we believe that demonstrating that adult 
learners' self-esteem is not detrimentally low is crucial. Teachers, who 
believe that learners suffer from an inadequate sense of self-worth may 
involuntarily contribute to it. Association between poverty and low 
literacy and low self-esteem is quite strong, so we really need to work 
towards making this conceptual shift occur -- it is much healthier to 
really believe that students who enroll into an adult education program 
do that to solve one of their problems (as opposed to believing that 
they came with a deficit that needs to be treated).

Ana.

In my experience with Montessori education unqualified praise will actually rob a child of their efforts and lead them to believe they should not do things for their own worth, but solely for the external praise. Personally, I believe the same applies to those educating adults. Any attempt to falsely raise someone's self-esteem without any effort or reason for the praise, will undercut any real attempt at praise when something significant is accomplished. Praise loses its worth when it is doled out constantly. It must be reserved for those moments of success through effort, even if the successes are small ones. I have a feeling there is probably a statistical bell curve of educators based on what is considered a "successful moment" deserving praise. It seems instincts and experience are the guides at this point.

What I feel is important to point out, is that the work that the educator must carefully consider what level of work to give each individual to ensure success is possible. In this sense, self-esteem is taken into consideration, as the student must feel they have a chance of success to even make an attempt at completing the task at hand. Those are my thoughts on the subject.

Craig

Hi Barb! You raised intriguing questions and I would love to hear educators' thoughts on this matter. 
>From my personal observations, informal conversations, and formal interviews with adult literacy teachers, I noticed that educators could be roughly split into two groups: those who believe that one of the key concerns of adult literacy is to raise learners' self-esteem because it's very low, and unless they do it, students cannot succeed, and those who think that teachers need to teach students skills and knowledge, and that self-esteem will naturally follow. If we look at Bandura's research, he believed that the relationship between self-efficacy (a concept, similar to self-esteem) and achievement follows the latter pattern -- you learn to do something well and your feeling of self-efficacy goes up, which, in turn, affects what you do in the future. Years of research showed that attempts to artificially build up students' self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing a "cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to lead to increas
ed sense of competence and self-worth. Therefore, starting off from the assumption about learners' low self-esteem would seem to be not quite as beneficial to students as simply trying to help them learn. 

The study definitely needs replication -- we can't really generalize our findings since only one adult learning center was used as our research setting. I have been recently contacted by a GED instructor from one of the Illinois colleges, who is interested in replicating my study. I am really looking forward to hear about the findings. If they are similar to mine, it will certainly make the case stronger. 
Thank you for your comments!

Ana.



This discussion is rich and fascinating. 

I'm very taken with Anastasiya's research, particularly since her findings resonate with much of my classroom experience. Of course, it is only one study and certainly needs to be replicated with similar and different populations to see how robust the findings are. 

In the meantime, I wonder how tied we are as teachers to the idea that our students have low self esteem. What role does that idea have in our views of ourselves as teachers?

Good points. 

There are our attitudes as teachers and the impact they have on learners' success, and then there are the techniques we choose.
 
This may be making a wild leap, but your comments make me think of the NCSALL study in which ABE teachers used Multiple Intelligence techniques with their students (see Focus on Basics Vol 3A, http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=161).

 Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences proposes that there are eight ---spatial, linguistic, interpesonal, bodily/kinesthetic, musical, naturalist, intrapersonal --- and maybe more identifiable intelligences. THe teachers  helped learners determine their "intelligence" and created lessons that enabled the learners to use it to build their academic skills. Teachers found this to be a very successful way to engage learners. It certainly would be a way to value learners'strengths genuinely.

Andres, I am not aware of any evidence to the 
affect that self-esteem is influenced by 
genetics.  By and large it is a product of life 
experience.  As you point out, some--Freire for 
example--believe that low self-esteem is a social 
construction.  It is one of those mechanisms that 
keep the oppressed in a state of 
oppression.  Others would focus more on the 
family.  To me, however, the most important point 
is that low-self esteem can be treated.  The 
question is how.  One school would argue that 
lots of social support and positive feedback is 
the way.  The problem with this is that it can 
lead to a very condescending attitude, a focus on 
deficit, and indirect reinforcement of the 
literacy stigma.  The other way to "treat" 
low-self-esteem is simply by helping learners to 
be successful.  Success is the most powerful antidote to low self-esteem.

Over thirty years ago, Last gamble on Education 
(Mezirow, Darkenwald & Knox) found that the 
characteristic that directors most sought in 
hiring teachers was a warm, pleasant 
personality.  It mattered less whether they could 
TEACH.  I think this is true today to a certain 
extent.  In my view, this value is misplaced.  If 
we want to enhance self-esteem the way to do it 
is to hire teachers who care more than anything 
about their learners progress and know how to produce it.

One way an educator can focus on success without
unwarranted external praise is a collaboration between
teacher and student to set individual goals for the
student's participation in the program.  The result is
a reasonable, definable and practical measure for
success that is backed by a student portfolio which
includes test results, samples of class work, ESL
Diary, etc.  All this feedback, together with
anonymous student evaluation of tasks assigned by the
teacher. informs the instructional process, thereby
insuring that teaching methods and goals are meeting
the needs of the students.  We also give certificates
when stduents are advanced to the next level and
generally have a celebration to acknowledge their
success.  Some students have commented that they have
never received any recognition, including a
certificate.  I for one use "smiley faces
reinforcement" only rarely so the impact is greater
than if used on a daily basis, although I do "smile"
often during class and use humor as often as
appropriate.  Bonnita

Well Said Bonnita. I agree that involving the student in goal setting and evaluation is an essential part of a successfull, collaborative educational experience. This has the added bonus of teaching goal setting skills at the same time as you teach your specific subject area. I also think it is important to celebrate success when goals are reached.

Another thing about praise is that most people sense and know when it is
being given meaninglessly and when it actually has to do with something done
well.  This can range from positive feedback about asking a question,
self-correcting, answering a question (just by saying thank you), getting
something right (e.g.. after being confused about ?there? and ?their? using
these words correctly) - any specific thing that is done well.  The absence
of harsh criticism vs. useful correction also figures here in the larger
picture of giving learners feedback that helps them do/learn whatever it is
they?re working on.

Janet Isserlis


In my experience with Montessori education unqualified praise will actually
rob a child of their efforts and lead them to believe they should not do
things for their own worth, but solely for the external praise. Personally,
I believe the same applies to those educating adults. Any attempt to falsely
raise someone's self-esteem without any effort or reason for the praise,
will undercut any real attempt at praise when something significant is
accomplished. Praise loses its worth when it is doled out constantly. It
must be reserved for those moments of success through effort, even if the
successes are small ones. I have a feeling there is probably a statistical
bell curve of educators based on what is considered a "successful moment"
deserving praise. It seems instincts and experience are the guides at this
point.
 
What I feel is important to point out, is that the work that the educator
must carefully consider what level of work to give each individual to ensure
success is possible. In this sense, self-esteem is taken into consideration,
as the student must feel they have a chance of success to even make an
attempt at completing the task at hand. Those are my thoughts on the
subject.

Hal:

Hal: 

I agree with you 100%. The issue to me is what examples of student
successes are and how to create the possibility for true success. This
is very Hegelian. IE: The worker recognizes herself in the product of
her work. So, the person who makes the chair is proud of making a good
quality chair. However, factory work takes away the relationship between
the worker and the chair. The worker only nails a nail and never sees
the chair. He becomes alienated form his own work and we end up needing
a socialist revolution   ;-) You can give him a certificate for doing
good work, but the certificate is meaningless praise.

The same and more is the case with ABE students. Learning needs to
result in a meaningful outcome so that students may recognize themselves
in their work. At the same time, we must create tasks that allow
students to be able to be productive so they can have something that
they identify with. 

Our students just published a collection of short stories. This is the
second publication and it is available on line at:
http://bordersenses.com/memorias

Actually, the second volume is not available yet. However, you can see
the first volume and get an idea of the project. In terms of the issue
of creating possibilities for success I wrote something specifically
about this in the intro to the second volume. Below is an excerpt:

"Our pedagogical approach is grounded in the idea that GED instruction
requires good reading and writing skills. However, many of our students
have had little exposure to reading and writing. So, developing these
skills, a challenge in itself, becomes more challenging when the
students are uninterested in the subject and have little familiarity
with it. However, if students can build their reading and writing skills
by documenting and reading their own experiences, they will be familiar
with the knowledge and they will relate to it. Moreover, they will feel
validated if their knowledge and experiences are documented for
posterity.  Once they build their reading and writing skills, they will
be able to apply these skills to new knowledge and new academic and real
life problems."

This is both Freirian and Deweyian.

Andres, I am not aware of any evidence to the 
affect that self-esteem is influenced by 
genetics.  By and large it is a product of life 
experience.  As you point out, some--Freire for 
example--believe that low self-esteem is a social 
construction.  It is one of those mechanisms that 
keep the oppressed in a state of 
oppression.  Others would focus more on the 
family.  To me, however, the most important point 
is that low-self esteem can be treated.  The 
question is how.  One school would argue that 
lots of social support and positive feedback is 
the way.  The problem with this is that it can 
lead to a very condescending attitude, a focus on 
deficit, and indirect reinforcement of the 
literacy stigma.  The other way to "treat" 
low-self-esteem is simply by helping learners to 
be successful.  Success is the most powerful antidote to low
self-esteem.

Over thirty years ago, Last gamble on Education 
(Mezirow, Darkenwald & Knox) found that the 
characteristic that directors most sought in 
hiring teachers was a warm, pleasant 
personality.  It mattered less whether they could 
TEACH.  I think this is true today to a certain 
extent.  In my view, this value is misplaced.  If 
we want to enhance self-esteem the way to do it 
is to hire teachers who care more than anything 
about their learners progress and know how to produce it.

Hal: While there may not be studies relating genes to self esteem, there
is evidence that Genes trigger flow of neurotransmitters between
neurons. We know that there is some connection between the presence of
serotonin and dopamine between neurons and depression. Now, what is
depression? It is a state of mind like self esteem. In fact, poor self
esteem could be a form of depression. 

One of the questions that needs to be answered is if the flow of
neurotransmitter is triggered by the environment, or if this is
inherited. It seems that there may be a bit of both.  

I suffer from depression and take Effexor. I know that my depression
attacks were originally triggered by the environment, but currently they
happen w/o me being conscious of environmental triggers. In fact, if I
don't take Effexor, I start getting depressed within 4 to 5 months. In
my case, my depression is not associated with poor self esteem though.
However, I know people that get depressed because of this. 

The Genome, by Ridley is a great airplane read, short and sweet. It
seems that genetics controls a lot more than people think.

Bonnita et al:

Regarding your question about Asian students and success, there is
research done by John Ogbu about this. Ogbu argues that there different
kind of minority groups. He refers to voluntary and involuntary
minorities. Voluntary minorities are those that came into the US
voluntarily in search of a better life. Children from Voluntary
minorities tend to do very well in school. Parents tend to push the kids
to succeed. Usually, children of immigrants from other countries tend to
do very well in school. They will do even better if they were already
doing well in school in their native countries.  

Involuntary minorities are those that were born into a devalued minority
status in the US. Ogbu identifies Chicanos and blacks as examples of two
involuntary minorities. According to Ogbu, when Chicano and black
children go to school, they face a dilemma. If they learn the standard
English and they learn the rules of hegemonic America, they have to
unlearn the language and culture of their families and community. This
puts children in a dilemma. They either begin to act "whitie" and
succeed in hegemonic America, or reject the hegemonic values and stick
to their own sociocultural group. 

There are other reasons for certain groups to do better than others in
school. I will not get into the details right now, but they are more
complex than just praise.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 507]  Self-Esteem and teacher expectations
Message-ID: <s51a7658.029@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

It's interesting that many of our conversations come around to teacher
expectations and involving the students in setting their goals. Take a
look back at an exchange from the list back in March for some thoughts
on this. 

Go to:
http://www.nifl.gov/pipermail/focusonbasics/2006/date.html

and scroll down to March 9th and 10th to see the conversation.  See
excerpt below with a recommended reference:
************************************
Excerpt from earlier conversation about teacher expectations:

A new study just came out, The Color of Success, by Gilberto Conchas. 
He's a sociologist who studied an urban high school which is successful 
at getting minority students to graduate and go on to college. What he 
found is that detracking, career academies and high teacher and parent 
expectations were key to the success of these students. 

The high achievement of the Vietnamese students was the most surprising,

as these students had none of the educational or economic advantages 
usually associated with Asian students. However, they were still 
treated as "the model minority" by the school and rose to meet the high 
expectations placed on them.

Hey, I am tremendously gratified.  I can't remember the last time 
anyone agreed with me 100%.  Neither can I remember you agreeing with 
anyone 100%.  Must be chance and will probably never happen again.  Cheers.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 509]  Self-esteem stigma and Student Success
Message-ID: <s51a86f7.004@mail.jsi.com>

I agree that we should be thinking about how our programs can create
success for our students in different ways, and I can see how labeling
them as having "low self-esteem" can "strengthen the existing stigma"
(Ana) rather than help. 

So we are now looking at two ideas: 

1. How can we minimize the detrimental effects that can come from a
presumption of low self-esteem? So far we have talked about low
expectations, false praise and devaluing strong teaching in favor of
efforts to boost self-esteem. Are there other things we should stop
doing?

 2. What can our programs do to facilitate student successes? Should we
make more effort to "hire teachers who care more than anything about
their learners progress and know how to produce it"? (Hal) What other
measures of success can we aim for?

I'd love to hear others' thoughts on these two points! Any of you who
haven't commented yet...? Here's mine:

Re: 2.) I like Andres' example of having something like the stories to
mark students' successes. Years ago I was involved with a project called
HEAL (Health Education and Adult Literacy), which was a curriculum that
taught learners about breast and cervical cancer, screenings, and
prevention. The program pushed learners to improve their literacy skills
enough to seek health information and services and communicate
confidently with health providers. But it went beyond that by also
pushing for an action. They had to teach others in their community and
actually make appointments with health providers. I believe that this
action enhanced the power of the literacy skills alone to boost their
measures of their own success within their families and communitites.

Julie



say "you have to be clear with me" to health providersbeyond learningA
big part of the curriculum involved taking action in their community 
there was a lot of empowering going on by learning about taking action
for health and .
Do we, as literacy teachers, help to make this change happen, and if so,
how?


of I'd love to hear people's thoughts on these two things:

Hal: 

I agree with you 100%. The issue to me is what examples of student
successes are and how to create the possibility for true success. This
is very Hegelian. IE: The worker recognizes herself in the product of
her work. So, the person who makes the chair is proud of making a good
quality chair. However, factory work takes away the relationship between
the worker and the chair. The worker only nails a nail and never sees
the chair. He becomes alienated form his own work and we end up needing
a socialist revolution   ;-) You can give him a certificate for doing
good work, but the certificate is meaningless praise.

The same and more is the case with ABE students. Learning needs to
result in a meaningful outcome so that students may recognize themselves
in their work. At the same time, we must create tasks that allow
students to be able to be productive so they can have something that
they identify with. 

Our students just published a collection of short stories. This is the
second publication and it is available on line at:
http://bordersenses.com/memorias

Actually, the second volume is not available yet. However, you can see
the first volume and get an idea of the project. In terms of the issue
of creating possibilities for success I wrote something specifically
about this in the intro to the second volume. Below is an excerpt:

"Our pedagogical approach is grounded in the idea that GED instruction
requires good reading and writing skills. However, many of our students
have had little exposure to reading and writing. So, developing these
skills, a challenge in itself, becomes more challenging when the
students are uninterested in the subject and have little familiarity
with it. However, if students can build their reading and writing skills
by documenting and reading their own experiences, they will be familiar
with the knowledge and they will relate to it. Moreover, they will feel
validated if their knowledge and experiences are documented for
posterity.  Once they build their reading and writing skills, they will
be able to apply these skills to new knowledge and new academic and real
life problems."

This is both Freirian and Deweyian.

Andres, I am not aware of any evidence to the 
affect that self-esteem is influenced by 
genetics.  By and large it is a product of life 
experience.  As you point out, some--Freire for 
example--believe that low self-esteem is a social 
construction.  It is one of those mechanisms that 
keep the oppressed in a state of 
oppression.  Others would focus more on the 
family.  To me, however, the most important point 
is that low-self esteem can be treated.  The 
question is how.  One school would argue that 
lots of social support and positive feedback is 
the way.  The problem with this is that it can 
lead to a very condescending attitude, a focus on 
deficit, and indirect reinforcement of the 
literacy stigma.  The other way to "treat" 
low-self-esteem is simply by helping learners to 
be successful.  Success is the most powerful antidote to low
self-esteem.

Over thirty years ago, Last gamble on Education 
(Mezirow, Darkenwald & Knox) found that the 
characteristic that directors most sought in 
hiring teachers was a warm, pleasant 
personality.  It mattered less whether they could 
TEACH.  I think this is true today to a certain 
extent.  In my view, this value is misplaced.  If 
we want to enhance self-esteem the way to do it 
is to hire teachers who care more than anything 
about their learners progress and know how to produce it.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 510]    Instructional practices leading to success
Message-ID: <451B31E7.4020308@optimaltec.com>

This has been a great day of discussion.
Many touched upon the issue of assessment and how it affects students' 
perceptions of their performance. Julie raised a question about 
instructional practices leading to students' success. I believe 
assessment may be one of the key areas of pedagogy to consider, and here 
are some thoughts on it.
A significant portion of the teacher?s time is devoted to the evaluation 
of students? performance. Ideally, such assessment of products or 
behavior should provide students with the necessary information that 
would allow them to adjust their learning strategies, get rid of 
existing misconceptions, correct mistakes, increase (or sustain) 
motivation, and, ultimately, move them closer to the desired goals. That 
is, it should facilitate student successes not just provide teachers 
with information about what is learned. However, research has shown that 
very often the impact of assessment on students? performance and 
motivation has the opposite ? adverse ? effect. Possible reasons for 
such a quandary are hidden in specific attributes of evaluative 
practices, with the quality and type of feedback being among the most 
important ones. Our understanding of differential effects of assessment 
in general and feedback in particular on students? learning is crucial 
to ensure optimal outcomes of education.

I recently conducted a literature review on the effect of feedback on 
leaning and motivation. What most studies show is that the key role of 
teachers in every classroom from kindergarten to the most advanced 
educational setting is to provide information about the gap between 
students current performance and the desired performance (as identified 
by teacher, student, and/or curriculum). Some of the main findings are: 
1) The more frequent the feedback, the more effective it is. 2) 
Informative feedback comprised of explanations of mistakes and 
suggestions for corrective measures, is much more effective than a 
simple statement of correct or incorrect. 3) Feedback should focus on 
the task not the learner, or attention to the self depletes cognitive 
resources and compromises learning. For instance, criticism should be 
about the task, not the learner. In this case, the students' self-esteem 
will be able to weather the corrective nature of the feedback and they 
won't be discouraged. 4) Grades and numerical scores , even if presented 
along with comments, were found to reduce motivation and short circuit 
the learning process (when you get the score of a game, you don't want 
to watch it).
To provide good feedback is really time consuming.
So what are your thoughts about the best assessment practice in the 
adult literacy classroom?
Looking forward to your comments.
Ana.

In our Adult Ed department, administration is focusing
on excellence in assessment in the formal teacher
evaluation process this year.  The main thrust of this
focus is to establish clear learning goals that begin
with needs and skill level assessment.  It is expected
that the instructor will use a variety of assessments
embedded in the instruinal process through backward
planning.  Assessments are aligned to curriculum and
standards and guide lesson planning.  Instructors use
not only formal testing measures, but also student
constructed assessments, when appropriate, and an
informal, routine check for understanding during the
lesson presentation.  Students know how and when they
will be assessed; teachers give timely, accurate and
constructive feedback to students while providing time
for students to reflect.  Students track their own
progress and look forward to assessments, thereby
taking ownership of their progress and goals.

This is a huge undertaking for both adminsitration and
staff.  To my way of thinking, assessment should
inform instruction as well as informing the student of
his/her progress.  Clear learning goals that are
communicated to the students and revisited frequently
during the course of instruction is key to student and
teacher success.

I would argue that there is a difference in working with adults,
particularly those with traumatic histories.  

 

I work with women trapped in multi-generational poverty.  Most of them
come with a legacy of poor health, addiction, and violence.  Many have
been convinced of their inability to succeed through decades of being
called stupid and worthless, and existing in a society that confirms
their lack of self worth.  Largely, they have "become" their mistakes,
instead of being able to move forward in life.  I believe they are in
need of constant praise, whether it is for getting 100% on a math test
or simply showing up for school on a rainy day.  It takes a lot of
positive reinforcement to undo so many years of negativity.

In my experience with Montessori education unqualified praise will
actually rob a child of their efforts and lead them to believe they
should not do things for their own worth, but solely for the external
praise. Personally, I believe the same applies to those educating
adults. Any attempt to falsely raise someone's self-esteem without any
effort or reason for the praise, will undercut any real attempt at
praise when something significant is accomplished. Praise loses its
worth when it is doled out constantly. It must be reserved for those
moments of success through effort, even if the successes are small ones.
I have a feeling there is probably a statistical bell curve of educators
based on what is considered a "successful moment" deserving praise. It
seems instincts and experience are the guides at this point.

 

What I feel is important to point out, is that the work that the
educator must carefully consider what level of work to give each
individual to ensure success is possible. In this sense, self-esteem is
taken into consideration, as the student must feel they have a chance of
success to even make an attempt at completing the task at hand. Those
are my thoughts on the subject.

	Hi Barb! You raised intriguing questions and I would love to
hear educators' thoughts on this matter. 
	>From my personal observations, informal conversations, and
formal interviews with adult literacy teachers, I noticed that educators
could be roughly split into two groups: those who believe that one of
the key concerns of adult literacy is to raise learners' self-esteem
because it's very low, and unless they do it, students cannot succeed,
and those who think that teachers need to teach students skills and
knowledge, and that self-esteem will naturally follow. If we look at
Bandura's research, he believed that the relationship between
self-efficacy (a concept, similar to self-esteem) and achievement
follows the latter pattern -- you learn to do something well and your
feeling of self-efficacy goes up, which, in turn, affects what you do in
the future. Years of research showed that attempts to artificially build
up students' self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing
a "cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to
lead to increas
	ed sense of competence and self-worth. Therefore, starting off
from the assumption about learners' low self-esteem would seem to be not
quite as beneficial to students as simply trying to help them learn. 
	 
	The study definitely needs replication -- we can't really
generalize our findings since only one adult learning center was used as
our research setting. I have been recently contacted by a GED instructor
from one of the Illinois colleges, who is interested in replicating my
study. I am really looking forward to hear about the findings. If they
are similar to mine, it will certainly make the case stronger. 
	Thank you for your comments!
	 
	Ana.
	 
	 
	 
	This discussion is rich and fascinating. 
	 
	I'm very taken with Anastasiya's research, particularly since
her findings resonate with much of my classroom experience. Of course,
it is only one study and certainly needs to be replicated with similar
and different populations to see how robust the findings are. 
	 
	In the meantime, I wonder how tied we are as teachers to the
idea that our students have low self esteem. What role does that idea
have in our views of ourselves as teachers?

Dorrie's comment reminded me of another example of the value of praise for small things. See link or excerpt below from Robin Schwarz' Article from FOB 8A: "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners."
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=994

How can we know to dish out praise appropriately? On one hand it can dilute real accomplishment, and on the other hand some people need to be encouraged for small steps...

Julie

*****************************
Excerpt from "Taking a Closer Look at Struggling ESOL Learners":

"...Henri, an older Haitian man...had sat for nearly a month in his beginning ESOL literacy class without responding or doing anything. Once the door was closed for our interview and I told him his teacher was concerned, Henri poured out a touching story about prostate problems that totally preoccupied him. His daughter wanted him to learn English, he said, and he came to class only to make her happy. Knowing why Henri was making slow progress helped his teacher to feel less frustrated and more positive about him. His teacher started to provide careful encouragement, congratulating him for being in class at all and for any effort he made to participate, rather than focusing on Henri?s comparative lack of progress. Tiny successes * completing an activity in class with another student; participating in an oral activity successfully * helped Henri to be more engaged while he wrestled with his health problem."

self-efficacy (a concept, similar to self-esteem) and achievement

feeling of self-efficacy goes up, which, in turn, affects what you do in
the future. Years of research showed that attempts to artificially build
up students' self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing
a "cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to

Every person is different and unique, so dealing with the self-esteem
issue is going to be even more diverse. But, generally working with the
person on a daily basis the instructor will get to know them and be able
to understand what would help them improve on the person a whole. I
think this will help raise self-esteem as well as other attributes of
the person.

Dorrie raises an issue that has been on my mind as I have followed this
discussion (cursorily I'm sorry to say, due to my time constraints). I
am somewhat troubled by the term "self-esteem" and never really use it
myself. For me, it implies that your feelings about yourself come from
within and ignores the dynamic between the individual and society and
the way that race, class, and gender combine to shape people's
perceptions of themselves.
 
To what extent do we internalize society's definitions of us? To what
extent do students in A.B.E. programs internalize the society's labels
for them? And how easy is it to disentangle the literacy labels from
those that have to do with being poor (for those students who are poor)
or with being black or latino (for those who.....) or with being a
woman, etc.
 
One place this thinking leads me is to the idea that people's
perceptions of themselves, their self-confidence, might benefit more
from a critical look at the way class, gender, and race have played out
in their lives than from praise (though I am all for praise). Perhaps
this is some of what goes on with the stories Andres has written about.

One way to promote success would be to develop a series of meaningful 
benchmarks and recognition markers when the benchmarks have been 
achieved.  I would pattern them on real life tasks so there is also 
reinforcement from solving a real problem with newly acquired 
literacy skills.  For example. a benchmark for lower-level students 
might to write a grocery list and use it to do shopping.  Other tasks 
might be developed from the items on the NAAL test.  That way we 
would know their degree of difficulty.  For low level readers who 
want the GED, the final payoff is so far distant,and in many cases 
the incremental benchmarks are so vague, that the power of feeling 
successful just is not there.

A few observations about this praise/self-esteem question:
In my school I have become somewhat infamous among the students because 
whenever anyone passes by I say, "How's my favorite student doing 
today?" or "how is my most advanced student today?" Once a student 
called me on it and said, "how can he be your favorite if I'm your 
favorite?" I replied to him, "Does a father tell his daughter that he 
likes her sister better?"

I don't know if this meets Craig's definition of unqualified praise. I 
started doing it because when I was in school myself, a professor told 
me and a group of other students that we were his "advanced" group. 
Clearly, we all knew it was false, but it didn't seem to matter. In my 
own school now, when I say it to someone, another student who may be 
present will look knowingly at the other and say, "Oh, are you his 
favorite too?" I hope it sends a message to everyone that I like them 
and I care about them.

Our school has a very attractive document that we call a transcript, 
which lists all the credits a student earned. It has a nice emblem of 
our school on it and an embossed gold seal, signed by the principal. 
Every time a student earns credit he or she gets a new copy with the new 
credit added to the list. Maybe sometimes there's a smile or a pat on 
the back that comes with it when we pass them out, but I think the 
transcripts themselves do more to boost self-esteem than praise does. 
The transcripts represent accomplishment.

When I look introspectively at that thing I call self-esteem in myself, 
it seems to stem from my sense of accomplishment and of knowing that I'm 
doing something important. Praise makes me feel good and it encourages 
me to work more. Any good manager knows about that. It is easy to spot 
praise that is not genuine and the first thing I do when I receive 
praise that I sense is not genuine is to look at the motives of the 
person giving it out. But I don't think praise has much to do with 
self-esteem.

>Hi Barb! You raised intriguing questions and I would love to hear educators' thoughts on this matter. 
>>From my personal observations, informal conversations, and formal interviews with adult literacy teachers, I noticed that educators could be roughly split into two groups: those who believe that one of the key concerns of adult literacy is to raise learners' self-esteem /because it's very low, /and unless they do it, students cannot succeed, and those who think that teachers need to teach students skills and knowledge, and that self-esteem will naturally follow. If we look at Bandura's research, he believed that the relationship between self-efficacy (a concept, similar to self-esteem) and achievement follows the latter pattern -- you learn to do something well and your feeling of self-efficacy goes up, which, in turn, affects what you do in the future. Years of research showed that attempts to artificially build up students' self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing a "cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to lead to increas

Message-ID: <s51ceadc.093@mail.jsi.com>

One thing I found interesting about Ana's work  is that she took a
common assumption about adult learners, found that there was no real
evidence to back it up, and tested it with the best available tools. 
Her research turned up results that surprised most of us, and may
improve our practices. I think this is a bold and necessary step.

I hear a lot of opinions based on observation that people seem to take
as fact, and this work reminds us that our assumptions may actually
prove to be incorrect or incomplete. Of course, some skepticism is
healthy, but if we base our teaching practices on unverified
assumptions, might that impede the educational process?

What do people think about this?

Very well said, Bonnita.

I did not mean at all to imply that teacher experience and observation
were not to be counted and valued, but to discuss how they can work
together with research. I hope my comment did not come out that way!

If we base our teaching practices on unverified assumptions, we may 
surely waste a lot of time, or worse. I would argue we need a lot more 
than just "some" skepticism.

Today, with all the emphasis on practices based on research, it is 
important to know that research, including scientific research, can be 
flawed. It can yield incorrect conclusions. Much educational research 
relies on extremely powerful statistical analysis of observable facts to 
establish correlations or to determine cause and effect. The accuracy of 
such analyses depends on two huge assumptions at are often overlooked, 
sometimes conveniently overlooked. First is the assumption that the data 
is normal, that is it fits a perfect bell curve.  Second is the 
assumption that the types of data we wish to analyze are suitable for 
the statistical procedure we wish to use. If they are not, the 
conslusions we draw from them will be incorrect.

One of the more useful graduate courses I took was an educational 
research methods course, in which I learned to look critically at 
research. Some of the important lessons I learned were:

-Research is not about getting closer to the truth. It's about 
supporting or refuting a point of view.
-Designing really good scientific research is extremely difficult, if 
not almost impossible, in educational settings.
-You can never "prove" an assertion with research; you can only add 
support to it, or disprove it.
-A correlation does not suggest cause (however the popular press almost 
always mistakes the former for the latter).
-Every piece of research is susceptible to inherent biases, 
unreliability, and questionable validity which lead to questions about 
its conclusions. and;
-There is a lot of bad research floating around out there, especially in 
the area of educational research.

I don't mean to suggest that educational research should not be 
conducted or used. I do think it is vital to know about its weaknesses 
so that we can interpret it wisely so that our opinions will not be 
based, as Julie wrote, on incorrect or incomplete assumptions.

Tom:
 
I agree with you. In fact, another way to state what you say is that scientific experiments do not prove anything to be true. Rather they falsify or are unable to falsify a claim. So, the research does not prove that there is no difference in the self esteem of the two groups looked at. Rather, the researcher could not find evidence to disprove the claim that there is a difference. Or, the researcher could not falsify the claim that there is no difference between the two groups. 
 
Moreover, the claim that science is objective is subjective. the judgements are subjective, the reseach instruments are subjective. In other words, before the scientist makes the experiment, she must develop questions. The questions are not given in nature, rather she develops them using logic. The issues to be researched is also slelected by the means of logic and making a judgement. That means that the mind is making subjective judgements to conceive the experiment and during the performance of the experiment. 
 
this is not to say that science is useless. It simply means, as as Bonita, tom and Julie suggest, that research results have to be understood in context and within the limitations of science. while applying practitioner's wisdom to them. By the same time token, practitioner's wisdom does not mean any wild guess that a teacher may want to make or any illogical analisis. It means that teachers' critical and well founded analises have value in understanding research in the context of practice.

This reminds me of a study out of Kentucky not too long ago where a new 
science teaching program was being tried out on two classes in a high 
school.   THe two teachers were given the same training and for all 
intents and purposes, the students were of similar background and 
education--they were not divided for the purposes of the trial of the 
program.   At the end of the year, one class had done extremely well on 
the program, while the other had done rather poorly.  Those studying 
the situation finally concluded that the only factor that differed 
signficantly between the two classes was the attitudes/expectations of 
the teachers-- the teacher of the successful class expected that her 
students would do well with the new program, while the other teacher 
had openly expressed her doubt that her students would be able to 
manage it--and they didn't.    This is known in psychology, I believe, 
as the Pygmalion effect-- you become what your teacher expects you to 
become.    Robin Lovrien Schwarz  ( I am in the throes of moving and 
cannot dig up that reference just now--will do so if anyone is

This posting has jogged my memory about a study that
was done in Oakland CA with the teachers of Asian
students in Oakland High School.  As I recall,
students from families that were in the higher
socio-economic strata in their country of origin as
well as students from families in the lowest
socio-economic strata, in this case the grave diggers'
families, out performed their fellow students of all
racial backgrounds.  The study concluded this was
largely due to teacher expectation--teachers expected
Asian students to do well in school and interacted
with them accordingly, another factor to consider when
discussing student self esteem.  If I can find the
study, I will share with the discussion group.  I
believe it was conducted by the University of
California, Berkeley.  Bonnita

It's even more of a gift to have that person daily confirm his or her 
own strengths --my experience in working with a lot of adult learners 
is that they don't believe they have any--you ask what their strengths 
are and they say "I don't have any."  Everyone has strengths--having 
someone tell you is nice, but knowing it and being able to name 
them--no matter what they are--is even more powerful for the learner.

In my experience with Montessori education unqualified praise will 
actually rob a child of their efforts and lead them to believe they 
should not do things for their own worth, but solely for the external 
praise. Personally, I believe the same applies to those educating 
adults. Any attempt to falsely raise someone's self-esteem without any 
effort or reason for the praise, will undercut any real attempt at 
praise when something significant is accomplished. Praise loses its 
worth when it is doled out constantly. It must be reserved for those 
moments of success through effort, even if the successes are small 
ones. I have a feeling there is probably a statistical?bell curve of 
educators based on what is considered a "successful moment" deserving 
praise. It seems instincts and experience are the guides at this point.


?


What I feel is important to point out, is that the work that the 
educator must carefully consider what level of work to give each 
individual to ensure success is possible. In this sense, self-esteem is 
taken into consideration, as the student must feel they have a chance 
of success to even make an attempt at completing the task at hand. 
Those are my thoughts on the subject.

Hi Barb! You raised intriguing questions and I would love to hear 
educators' thoughts on this matter. >From my personal observations, 
informal conversations, and formal interviews with adult literacy 
teachers, I noticed that educators could be roughly split into two 
groups: those who believe that one of the key concerns of adult 
literacy is to raise learners' self-esteem because it's very low, and 
unless they do it, students cannot succeed, and those who think that 
teachers need to teach students skills and knowledge, and that 
self-esteem will naturally follow. If we look at Bandura's research, he 
believed that the relationship between self-efficacy (a concept, 
similar to self-esteem) and achievement follows the latter pattern -- 
you learn to do something well and your feeling of self-efficacy goes 
up, which, in turn, affects what you do in the future. Years of 
research showed that attempts to artificially build up students' 
self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing a 
"cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to 
lead to increased sense of competence and self-worth. Therefore, 
starting off from the assumption about learners' low self-esteem would 
seem to be not quite as beneficial to students as simply trying to help 
them learn. ?The study definitely needs replication -- we can't really 
generalize our findings since only one adult learning center was used 
as our research setting. I have been recently contacted by a GED 
instructor from one of the Illinois colleges, who is interested in 
replicating my study. I am really looking forward to hear about the 
findings. If they are similar to mine, it will certainly make the case 
stronger. Thank you for your comments!?Ana.???This discussion is rich 
and fascinating. ?I'm very taken with Anastasiya's research, 
particularly since her findings resonate with much of my classroom 
experience. Of course, it is only one study and certainly needs to be 
replicated with similar and different populations to see how robust the 
findings are. ?In the meantime, I wonder how tied we are as teachers to 
the idea that our students have low self esteem. What role does that 
idea have in our views of ourselves as teachers?Barb GarnerEditor,

I agree, Hal, that large, distant goals do not provide evidence of 
success that discouraged learners so dearly need.  The observation from 
the NCSALL  persistence report that learners need and want clear, 
obtainable goals underscores that.  When learners begin to understand, 
with structured guidance, that completing short term goals in a short 
time--two weeks, for example, is the way to gradual progress toward 
larger, longer term goals, their sense of success builds very quickly.  
Training in such goal setting and in knowing what one needs to do to 
compensate for learning challenges in the process has been known to 
help learners gain the self esteem and confidence they need to continue 
towards that distant GED or college or whatever other goal the learner 
has held deep inside for a lifetime.  Robin Lovrien Schwarz

One way to promote success would be to develop a series of meaningful
benchmarks and recognition markers when the benchmarks have been
achieved.  I would pattern them on real life tasks so there is also
reinforcement from solving a real problem with newly acquired
literacy skills.  For example. a benchmark for lower-level students
might to write a grocery list and use it to do shopping.  Other tasks
might be developed from the items on the NAAL test.  That way we
would know their degree of difficulty.  For low level readers who
want the GED, the final payoff is so far distant,and in many cases
the incremental benchmarks are so vague, that the power of feeling
successful just is not there.

This is what I meant, exactly!  The joy of the exchange is fire in your belly. I didn't mean for it to sound one-way.  Working on resumes is a great way to uncover the hidden talents...students really don't see their strengths and often we don't see ours either. Discovery and putting it out for view, etc- I find that students enjoy sharing strengths with each other too, just as any other adult would.  We have lots of assets within a class and students find ways to use their strengths to help each other.  I am not the most important person in the classroom, only the facilitator until students can run the show themselves.

It's even more of a gift to have that person daily confirm his or her 
own strengths --my experience in working with a lot of adult learners 
is that they don't believe they have any--you ask what their strengths 
are and they say "I don't have any."  Everyone has strengths--having 
someone tell you is nice, but knowing it and being able to name 
them--no matter what they are--is even more powerful for the learner.

I would argue that there is a difference in working with adults, 
particularly those with traumatic histories.?

I work with women trapped in multi-generational poverty. ?Most of them 
come with a legacy of poor health, addiction, and violence.? Many have 
been convinced of their inability to succeed through decades of being 
called stupid and worthless, and existing in a society that confirms 
their lack of self worth.? Largely, they have "become" their mistakes, 
instead of being able to move forward in life.? I believe they are in 
need of constant praise, whether it is for getting 100% on a math test 
or simply showing up for school on a rainy day.? It takes a lot of 
positive reinforcement to undo so many years of negativity.?

In my experience with Montessori education unqualified praise will 
actually rob a child of their efforts and lead them to believe they 
should not do things for their own worth, but solely for the external 
praise. Personally, I believe the same applies to those educating 
adults. Any attempt to falsely raise someone's self-esteem without any 
effort or reason for the praise, will undercut any real attempt at 
praise when something significant is accomplished. Praise loses its 
worth when it is doled out constantly. It must be reserved for those 
moments of success through effort, even if the successes are small 
ones. I have a feeling there is probably a statistical?bell curve of 
educators based on what is considered a "successful moment" deserving 
praise. It seems instincts and experience are the guides at this point.


?


What I feel is important to point out, is that the work that the 
educator must carefully consider what level of work to give each 
individual to ensure success is possible. In this sense, self-esteem is 
taken into consideration, as the student must feel they have a chance 
of success to even make an attempt at completing the task at hand. 
Those are my thoughts on the subject.

Hi Barb! You raised intriguing questions and I would love to hear 
educators' thoughts on this matter. >From my personal observations, 
informal conversations, and formal interviews with adult literacy 
teachers, I noticed that educators could be roughly split into two 
groups: those who believe that one of the key concerns of adult 
literacy is to raise learners' self-esteem because it's very low, and 
unless they do it, students cannot succeed, and those who think that 
teachers need to teach students skills and knowledge, and that 
self-esteem will naturally follow. If we look at Bandura's research, he 
believed that the relationship between self-efficacy (a concept, 
similar to self-esteem) and achievement follows the latter pattern -- 
you learn to do something well and your feeling of self-efficacy goes 
up, which, in turn, affects what you do in the future. Years of 
research showed that attempts to artificially build up students' 
self-esteem by praising every little thing they do (playing a 
"cheerleaders' role", as Hal puts it) and such, are very unlikely to 
lead to increased sense of competence and self-worth. Therefore, 
starting off from the assumption about learners' low self-esteem would 
seem to be not quite as beneficial to students as simply trying to help 
them learn. ?The study definitely needs replication -- we can't really 
generalize our findings since only one adult learning center was used 
as our research setting. I have been recently contacted by a GED 
instructor from one of the Illinois colleges, who is interested in 
replicating my study. I am really looking forward to hear about the 
findings. If they are similar to mine, it will certainly make the case 
stronger. Thank you for your comments!?Ana.???This discussion is rich 
and fascinating. ?I'm very taken with Anastasiya's research, 
particularly since her findings resonate with much of my classroom 
experience. Of course, it is only one study and certainly needs to be 
replicated with similar and different populations to see how robust the 
findings are. ?In the meantime, I wonder how tied we are as teachers to 
the idea that our students have low self esteem. What role does that 
idea have in our views of ourselves as teachers?Barb GarnerEditor,

 Now Available on Web Site
Message-ID: <6239961.1159820133052.JavaMail.root@elwamui-polski.atl.sa.earthlink.net>


Dear List Subscribers:
 
I'm writing to let you know that the full conference schedule for the Meeting of the Minds II Symposium is now available at www.researchtopractice.org. This is a national adult education practitioner-researcher conference, the goal of which is to create dialogue between adult education researchers and adult education teachers and administrators, with the aim of enhancing literacy practice. The Symposium is scheduled for November 30 through December 2, 2006, at the Sheraton Grand Hotel, Sacramento, California.
 
Participating researchers are from the National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL), from the American Institutes for Research (AIR), as well as from various universities and non-profit organizations. The opening plenary session on Thurday morning will feature Mark Kutner from AIR, who will present results of the National Assessment of Adult Literacy and the Health Literacy Survey, and John Comings, who will provide an overview of what NCSALL has learned from 10 years of research in adult literacy. 
 
A plenary session on Friday afternoon will feature a discussion on "how research has influenced adult literacy education policy at the national and state levels." Hal Beder from Rutgers University will provide an overview of the topic and moderate this session. Panelists include Cheryl Keenan, Director, Division of Adult Education and Literacy, US Department of Eduation; Sandra Baxter, Director of the National Institute for Literacy; and three state-level administrators: Bob Bickerton from Massachusetts; Jean Scott from California; and Israle Mendoza from Washington state. 
 
The three-day schedule is structured to include six strands of six concurrent sessions each, for a total of 36 sessions. Each session consists of a presentation of research, followed by a brief discussion/reaction from two practitioners, followed by an activity that involves session attendees, in small groups, in brainstorming implications of the research for practice, policy, and further research. CALPRO will post the list of implications to the Symposium Web site following the Symposium. 
 
Deadline for registering for the Symposium is November 15, 2006. There is no on-site registration.
Deadline for registering for a hotel room at the Sheraton Grand (at the CA staterate of $84/night) is November 9, 2006. The Symposium Web site, www.researchtopractice.org, will take you to registration links for both the symposium and the hotel.
 
Plan to attend this Symposium, network with other practitioners and researchers, and consider implications of research for your delivery of adult literacy education! Hope to see you in Sacramento in November!!

I find expectations to be an extremely slippery slope. On one hand I 
know about this research (and many other studies) that suggest that 
students will perform to their teachers' high expectations. This has to 
be tempered with  realism though. A severely reading disabled individual 
may never learn to read very well, and expectations, no matter how high, 
will change that. I have have found, too, that students will often only 
perform to the expectation and no higher. It is better to enter into 
your relationship with your student with no expectations --not high, not 
low -- and be prepared to accept and honor whatever the student is able 
to attain. I have also come to realize that my setting of expectations, 
if I'm not extremely careful in how I do it,  can define failure for a 
student, if he or she does not measure up to the expectation, and that 
is not something I want to do as a teacher.  I find I can't help but 
enter into a relationship with at least a minimum of expectations (e.g. 
the student WILL learn, we both will treat each other respectfully, and 
soforth). But I try not to set an expectation that a student will learn 
a certain thing or reach a certain level. Rather I encourage students to 
set their own expectations for themselves, as high as they can make 
them. It is my job to help them try to reach their expectations.

Friends,

I think you will be pleased by the attached news release, issued  
jointly today by Dollar General Corporation and CAAL. This has been  
in the making for some months. I hope it will bring a new sense of  
hope and possibility to those who toil in the adult education and  
literacy trenches of service, planning, and policy development and  
who appreciate the findings of the 2003 NAALs. Should you be unable  
to access the PDF attachment, you can see essentially the same  
information at the CAAL website (www.caalusa.org).

Hello All:  I have a different take on the Director
General's remarks.  It seems evident that the
"commitment of national governments" is vital for a
literacy program to move forward.  Given that some or
all of the governments have established methods and
ideas of schooling, it appears essential that any
UNESCO program begin with what is in place to "give
space for methods and approaches to develop at local
level, with full input from learners themselves." 
Experience in the US with students from a variety of
countries, pre-literate through literate students in
both an alphabet and non-alphabet based
languages--students who have experienced a variety of
methods and ideas of schooling--we have come to
understand, sometimes painfully, that student
expectations of classroom experiences cannot be
ignored, or we will lose them in the process.  It may
takes years of exposure to alternate methods, and most
often building a sense in the classroom that students
have valid input into their educational process,
before students begin to accept and profit from
alternate methods.  I for one would not want to deny
full input from the learners themselves.  For example,
moving from an authoritative classroom leadership to
inclusion of students in decisions that affect their
learning process is a major, and hard won, victory for
ESL teachers.  I view the Director General's statement
as a diplomacy guide for UNESCO providers of literacy
that will reap rewards by inclusion rather than
exclusion of the population to be served.  Respect for
people and the rich culture they bring to the
classroom is a basic if literacy programs are to be
successful.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 533]  Welcome to another year on the FOB list!
Message-ID: <s53502c0.075@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone, 

This is the beginning of our yearly cycle on the discussion lists, and I
want to welcome you all to another year of discussing the wealth of
Focus on Basics articles, sharing resources, and being part of this
online community!  

As you know, NCSALL's funding has not been continued, and we are all sad
to see that new issues of FOB will not keep coming as they have for the
past 9 years. We are still trying to find funding to continue FOB as an
online publication, and in the meantime we do have funding for another
year of this discussion list!  

There have been 33 issues of FOB, each with 6-8 articles about rigorous
research on adult education strategies, interventions and teaching
methods, written specifically to encourage practitioners to use the
information to improve teaching practices. I see this as a treasure
trove of material that we can share and discuss. While our usual plan
for this list is to discuss articles from new issues (and there is
another one due in December!), part of our plan for this year is to
review the collection of past Focus on Basics issues, and tie together
some themes from the entire collection. 

To help facilitate this review, we will have FOB Article-of-the-week:
every Tuesday, I will promote a past article and ask if anyone has any
comments or experience using this article that they would like to share.
  

PLEASE E-MAIL ME DIRECTLY WITH SUGGESTIONS OF AN ARTICLE-OF-THE-WEEK,
and I will use them in the weeks to come. Tell me your favorite article,
one that you have used in trainings, one that has improved your teaching
or program strategies, or one that just opened your eyes to a new idea. 


Thanks for being part of this community. I look forward to this year
ahead, and welcome any suggestions you have for improving the list!  


All the best,

Julie 


P.S. Please pass this on to anyone who may be interested in joining the
list and reviewing the treasure trove with us! They can subscribe at:

Message-ID: <s53505ed.004@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

In my last message, I described the new FOB Article-of-the-week, and
here is our first one. It is from the very first issue of FOB, Vol. 1A
from 1997, which explored the question: "What is Research?"

Understanding Quantitative Research on Adult Literacy
by Thomas Valentine
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=470 

This goes back to the basics and describes common purposes of research,
basic underlying concepts, common statistical procedures, and suggests
questions to ask yourself when reading educational research.

If you can, read this and let us know how it may have helped you, or how
you could use this article in your program.

Message-ID: <CB4082E7B582144084C72EC6C98D495911889A54@wdcrobe2m04.ed.gov>

			Dear Discussion List subscribers,

			As the National Institute for Literacy begins a new
fiscal year, we have taken steps to streamline the way we deliver
professional development to our discussion list members. We would like to
let you know about some changes ahead for some of the National Institute for
Literacy Discussion Lists. The changes affect the Women and Literacy List;
Poverty, Race, and Literacy List; Content Standards List; and Program
Leadership and Improvement List.

			First, effective October 30, 2006, we will be
closing the Content Standards and Program Leadership & Improvement lists. We
have chosen to close these two lists because we recognize that many of the
issues that impact Content Standards and Program Leadership & Improvement
carry across all the subject areas of our other Discussion Lists. 

			Second, effective November 6, 2006, we will be
merging of the Poverty, Race and Literacy List with the Women and Literacy
List. We have chosen to combine the two lists because we recognize that many
of the issues that impact one group also affect the other group, and believe
that many of the topics discussed on one list can benefit the other list.
Race and gender issues often intersect, and it is most both practical and
appropriate to have them intersect on one combined list.

			We will continue to provide access to discussion
archives on our website.

			Thank you for your active participation in the
Institute's lists. We invite you to explore all of our lists for to help you
further your own professional development.

			The Institute's lists include:

			Adult Literacy Professional Development 
			Assessment 
			Adult English Language Learners
			Family Literacy 
			Focus on Basics 
			Health & Literacy 
			Learning Disabilities 
			Poverty, Race, Women and Literacy
			Special Topics 
			Technology & Literacy 
			Workplace Literacy

the Institute's Discussion Lists can be found at

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 536]  FOB and the ALE Wiki
Message-ID: <s5377510.069@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

Part of my hope for this list in the coming year is to connect more with
the ALE Wiki. For those of you who haven't seen it, please read David
Rosen's update below, and check it out at:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Main_Page

There is a Topic Area on the Wiki called "Research to Practice, Practice
to Research", which shares a purpose with Focus on Basics, and I hope to
connect with this area to enrich our discussions of FOB's past and
present issues.

Let me know if you have any ideas for this collaboration, and at least
take a look at the current incarnation of this growing resource!

All the best,
Julie

*********************
>From David Rosen:

Colleagues,

The Adult Literacy Education Wiki (now with over 750 pages and nearly  
700 registered users) is becoming a very useful resource for teachers  
and other practitioners in adult literacy education.  It includes 30  
topics linking research, professional wisdom, and practice.  It  
offers easy-to-read archived discussions that were held on this and  
other discussion lists, links to research and other resources,  
questions (and sometimes answers) from teachers and other  
practitioners and researchers, a comprehensive adult literacy  
glossary, and more.  It's free, and it's designed for you.  Best of  
all, it's not only a set of informative web pages.  It's a community  
of practice.  You -- and your colleagues -- can easily add to and  
improve it. It's a wiki!

To check out the ALE wiki, go to:

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Main_Page

You will see that some ALE topics need to be nurtured, and to grow.  
They need a Topic Leader.  Perhaps you would be the right person to  
be a Topic Leader. To see a list of topics and leaders, go to

http://wiki.literacytent.org/index.php/Topic_Leaders

If you are interested in being a (volunteer) Topic Leader for an  
existing topic, or if you would like to help develop a new topic, e- 
mail me and tell me about yourself and your interest.

Hi Everyone,

There is a discussion happening on the English Language Learners
discussion list that may interest some of you. People are comparing the
value in teaching reading of using a variety of approaches vs. an
approach based purely on phonemic awareness and decoding skills. 

The following FOB Article is cited in this debate:
The Neurobiology of Reading and Dyslexia
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=278

Even if you are not subscribed to this list, you can read the current
discussion at this link:

It starts with post #766, and then continues under the subject:
"one-size-fits-all methodology".

This week's FOB Article -of-the-Week is from Volume 4D, which is about
Research to Practice.

Connecting Research and Practice
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=290 

The article looks at what is known about research utilization and what
NCSALL does in that regard. Use this to help you think about how you
personally use research in your own practice. This article is from 5
years ago. In what ways has the conception of research to practice
changed since then?

Please read this and share some thoughts about it on the list.

Thanks,

Research on the Economic Impact of the GED Diploma Panel

The National Institute for Literacy (Institute) and the National Center for
the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) announce the Research on
the Economic Impact of the GED Diploma Panel, a 30-minute video produced by
the Institute. This panel discussion focuses on the economic benefits that
accrue to holders of the General Educational Development (GED) credential.
It is based on a review by John Tyler of eight recent (published and
working) research papers on the GED.  Several of these papers were authored
by John Tyler, Richard Murnane, and John Willett, researchers with NCSALL
whose work has influenced what we know about the economic benefits of the
GED.  Presenters include John Tyler, Sara Fass, and Sue Snider; the
moderator is David Rosen.

Transitioning Adults to College: Adult Basic Education Program Models
by Cynthia Zafft, Silja Kallenbach, and Jessica Spohn
This NCSALL Occasional Paper describes five models that the staff at the New
England Literacy Resource Center at World Education, Inc., categorized
through a survey of adult education centers with transition components from
around the United States. This NCSALL Occasional Paper describes the five
models-Advising, GED-Plus, ESOL, Career Pathways, and College
Preparatory-and themes and recommendations that others contemplating adult
transition services might find helpful. It also chronicles the experiences
of four states (Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, and Oregon) in their efforts
to institutionalize transitions for adults. To download the paper, go to
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=26

Beyond the GED: Making Conscious Choices About the GED and Your Future
Newly revised to include new data and information on the Internet, this
guide for GED instructors offers lesson plans and helps teachers develop as
professionals. It also gives adult learners an opportunity to practice
writing, use graphs, read charts, and analyze research findings on the
economic impact of the GED. To download the guide, go to

Message-ID: <003301c6fae7$194a0ab0$0202a8c0@your4105e587b6>

Can anyone help with these questions?  As NCSALL's Outreach Coordinator, I
recently received this message. Do you know of any states that fund
counselors?  

Thanks, Kaye

Hi Kaye,

 

I was hoping you could help me out. Presently, I am a Doctoral candidate
trying to formulate my proposal. My topic is Counselor/counseling within
Adult Basic Education. I am having the most difficult time coming up with
national information. 

 

Could you either post my questions on your list serve or call me if you know
who I could speak to about this subject.

 

My questions are:

What states require a counselor on staff within their literacy programs?

Is the role of Adult Basic Educational counselor defined state-by-state or
is there a generic counselor role definition?

Is there a national organization that speaks to the role of counselor (as
advisor) within literacy programs (not post-secondary)

 

Thank you for your support

Michele Forlizzi

In many states, ABE and Literacy Programs are 2 different programs.  As far
as I know, Literacy Councils don not require or have
a counselor on staff.  Many are lucky just to be able to afford one or two
employees.  ABE Programs, on the hand, under the state
Dept. or Education, usually have a counselor available through the local
post-secondary vocational school.

I can't answer all those questions, but Volume 6, Issue A, (www.ncsall.net/?id=219) of Focus on Basics is on Counseling. Cathy Coleman did a quick national scan, trying to find out what states were doing to support counselors. While the article dates from 2002, much of the information is valid today.

The community college counselors and advising specialists are available
to our literacy and ABE/GED/ESL populations with academic advising,
career counseling and school planning.  In 30+ years in this work, I've
never been at a place that had a special counselor available for this
population.  The students have the same access as any other student
within the system.

In Kentucky, we do not have access to actual counselors.  Each program
may choose to spend funding to hire one, but to may knowledge, and I am
fairly active in the state, no program has been able to afford one.  In
Kentucky, we have what the state calls sole providers of literacy and
ABE/GED services.

Hello, everyone:

New on the Web site of the Center for Adult English Language Acquisition
is an annotated bibliography
on working with beginning and literacy level adult English Language
learners.  It is available at
http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/bibliographies/literacy.html


The resources in this collection were selected because they are
evidence-based and provide suggestions and materials for practitioners
working with adult English language learners. The voices of researchers
(e.g., Condelli & Wrigely, Nichols & Sangster); teachers, program
managers, curriculum writers, and trainers (e.g., Brod, Holt, and
Spiegel); and students (by way of an article by Florez  from Focus on
Basics) are included in this bibliography.

I am forwarding this requrest to the counselor that
works in one of our High School Subjects, ABE programs
in Oakland.  This adult ed school has a counselor
because of the HHS component and ABE students get the
benefit.  ABE programs at other AE schools do not have
counselors.  Bonnita

Katrina,
I think that you have pinpointed a critical aspect of counseling for
adult basic education students.  There is a difference between adult
basic education students (particularly the literacy and pre-GED
students),  and even community college students.  Community College
counselors are trained to encourage and facilitate students interested
in college.  For many of the lower level students, that is a long term
and iffy goal.

Dear FOBers:

The National College Transition Network produces practices that are
geared toward the counseling role in transition programs.  See
http://www.collegetransition.org/promising/practice.html 
Practices 1, 2, 5, & 6 are for counselors.  As well as several of the
Research-to-Practice Briefs:
http://www.collegetransition.org/promising/rp.html 

The counseling practices were developed as a specialty niche for
programs that find funding for a transition component (not always easy
but one area that local businesses/employers/foundations seem to be
interested in funding).  And, the practices have a more general career
development application.  Also, we have a adult student website that
could support counseling work with students.  See:

Hello, all:

As usual, I am very interested in what all of you have to say about the 
issues of counselors and counseling.  As some of you know, as part of my 
professional activities I am a Life and Career Management Services 
Consultant.  (You can find out more about this work on my website if you are 
interested: www.sinclairsystem.com.)  I would say that the majority of my 
clients have told me that they did not receive proper counseling or in some 
cases any counseling at all in their high school, and if applicable college, 
years.  As a result, they are often unclear about what they are about, that 
is, what they really want to do and how to go about finding and getting what 
they really want out of their school and work, and life in general.

I have done some research in this area, and in fact a few years ago while 
providing college preparedness advising to a group basic through AP high 
school seniors ran a few studies that were for my own interest but that have 
certainly informed what I do now.  During these studies I learned that our 
students, the most needy as well as the best and the brightest included, do 
not feel as if they are prepared for college or work.  The high school 
students also told me that they rarely went to the counselors as they 
believed them to be indifferent and/or inept.  This dovetails with my 
research in first and second year community college students, also basic 
through advanced, who also told me they felt that way.  The community 
college students also told  me that they believe the counseling facilities 
at their highly-touted facility are woefully inadequate.

Again, this response underscores my own experience when, a few years ago as 
I was finishing my doctorate in cognitive psychology and education, I worked 
as a community college advisor and counselor.  It was there I learned that 
many students, again basic through advanced, go to these counseling and 
advising centers unwillingly, and often as a last resort.  The reason?  They 
told me that they were often given wrong information, or incomplete 
information, and that in some cases this cost the students considerable loss 
in terms of tuition money and "wasted semesters."  On the other side of the 
coin I learned from my colleagues (and from my own experience) that the 
counseling and advising facilities at the community college were not what 
they might be.  As I recall, we advisors/counselors were in a "round-robin" 
kind of arrangement, where the emphasis was on how many students you saw in 
one hour, as opposed to how many students were advised/counseled correctly. 
There were also many discrepancies between what I knew to be "best practice" 
and what I saw going on.  And, it was at this same place that I saw with my 
own eyes the fallout from poor counseling in the form of student angst, 
depression, and so on--some of it most serious.

It is my idea now (and especially in light of the disappearing traditional 
American family system) that counseling/advising should begin in the early 
years of education, and indeed during the 8 years of my pilot studies with 
several area public elementary schools I provided just that.  I was 
responding in some part to the argument of whether schools should take on 
the roles of family and parenting.  It was my idea that this argument was 
moot, as the schools were already in that position--for better or worse. 
Therefore, as part of my program, I incorporated a counseling/advisement 
module to my model for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders, although the emphasis was 
on the 3rd grade.  The result was significant and impressive, for the very 
young students saw for themselves the road before them, and among other 
things learned about making wise choices.  Now, in my practice, I help my 
adolescent and adult clients revisit the territory that might have been 
covered by counselors and advisors at an earlier time.  The details or our 
success rate are fascinating, and again support my earlier theories and 
findings.

Thanks again for sharing your information.  Again, I invite you to review my 
work and website for additional information on what I do and how my 
background and education now services my community.

All best,

YES!  YES!  Thank you for eloquently stating and quantifyinbg what I
have observed first as a student, then a teacher, and as a parent of
three.  The counseling departments are critical at all phases of
education, but are never really supported by the powers that be.  They
are treated as luxuries with bare minimum expenditures.  

I believe that inadequate counseling is the main reason students do not
complete studies.  

Some colleges seem to have the attitude that a student semester is never
wasted--he/she learns something.  What they refuse to understand is that
their philosophy is short-sighted in that most students do not have a
trust fund that allows them the luxury of taking an unlimited number of
courses.  Therefore, they end up having to drop out without completing a
degree to verify what they have learned.  

I really feel that federal legislation should be passed that requires
reimbursement for "wasted" courses that are the result of poor advising
on the part of the college, and that a penalty fee be paid to the
student that is equal to 1/2 the average first-year salary of what
he/she would have earned if employed.  This might move the emphasis to
properly staffing and supporting counselors. 

By the way this opinion is my own and does not reflect that of my
employer.

Thanks, everyone for sharing your thoughts about counseling in literacy
programs. I think that in ABE programs, particlarly for pre-GED and ESOL
learners, the role of the counselor is quite different than in community
colleges, where it is mostly focused on schooling, course selection and
transitioning to work or higher learning. 

Where I used to work as an ESOL teacher, there were counselors who were
responsible for helping the students in any way necessary to help them
come to class. This meant referrals for childcare, transportation
vouchers, tutoring if needed, further testing for learning issues,
housing issues, domestic violence support, or even just a phone call to
remind them to come. This kind of suppport is essential for many adult
students who have lives that make the logistics of schooling very
difficult. This is very different than what we've talked about so far.

How do the states and programs support these kinds of counselors? How
worthwhile is it to do so?

We've talked about the following article before. It shows other examples
of how sitting down with a couselor can uncover key issues that affect
the student's learning.

The only programs I know of in my area where this kind of support occurs is in Even Start Family Literacy Programs and when students are being sponsored by faith based organizations with some dedicated volunteers.

programs. I think that in ABE programs, particlarly for pre-GED and ESOL
learners, the role of the counselor is quite different than in community
colleges, where it is mostly focused on schooling, course selection and
transitioning to work or higher learning. 

Where I used to work as an ESOL teacher, there were counselors who were
responsible for helping the students in any way necessary to help them
come to class. This meant referrals for childcare, transportation
vouchers, tutoring if needed, further testing for learning issues,
housing issues, domestic violence support, or even just a phone call to
remind them to come. This kind of suppport is essential for many adult
students who have lives that make the logistics of schooling very
difficult. This is very different than what we've talked about so far.

How do the states and programs support these kinds of counselors? How
worthwhile is it to do so?

We've talked about the following article before. It shows other examples
of how sitting down with a couselor can uncover key issues that affect
the student's learning.

YES!  YES!  Thank you for eloquently stating and quantifyinbg what I
have observed first as a student, then a teacher, and as a parent of
three.  The counseling departments are critical at all phases of
education, but are never really supported by the powers that be.  They
are treated as luxuries with bare minimum expenditures.  

I believe that inadequate counseling is the main reason students do not
complete studies.  

Some colleges seem to have the attitude that a student semester is never
wasted--he/she learns something.  What they refuse to understand is that
their philosophy is short-sighted in that most students do not have a
trust fund that allows them the luxury of taking an unlimited number of
courses.  Therefore, they end up having to drop out without completing a
degree to verify what they have learned.  

I really feel that federal legislation should be passed that requires
reimbursement for "wasted" courses that are the result of poor advising
on the part of the college, and that a penalty fee be paid to the
student that is equal to 1/2 the average first-year salary of what
he/she would have earned if employed.  This might move the emphasis to
properly staffing and supporting counselors. 

By the way this opinion is my own and does not reflect that of my
employer.

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 552] Re: Counselors/counseling services

Hello, all:

As usual, I am very interested in what all of you have to say about the 
issues of counselors and counseling.  As some of you know, as part of my

professional activities I am a Life and Career Management Services 
Consultant.  (You can find out more about this work on my website if you
are 
interested: www.sinclairsystem.com.)  I would say that the majority of
my 
clients have told me that they did not receive proper counseling or in
some 
cases any counseling at all in their high school, and if applicable
college, 
years.  As a result, they are often unclear about what they are about,
that 
is, what they really want to do and how to go about finding and getting
what 
they really want out of their school and work, and life in general.

I have done some research in this area, and in fact a few years ago
while 
providing college preparedness advising to a group basic through AP high

school seniors ran a few studies that were for my own interest but that
have 
certainly informed what I do now.  During these studies I learned that
our 
students, the most needy as well as the best and the brightest included,
do 
not feel as if they are prepared for college or work.  The high school 
students also told me that they rarely went to the counselors as they 
believed them to be indifferent and/or inept.  This dovetails with my 
research in first and second year community college students, also basic

through advanced, who also told me they felt that way.  The community 
college students also told  me that they believe the counseling
facilities 
at their highly-touted facility are woefully inadequate.

Again, this response underscores my own experience when, a few years ago
as 
I was finishing my doctorate in cognitive psychology and education, I
worked 
as a community college advisor and counselor.  It was there I learned
that 
many students, again basic through advanced, go to these counseling and 
advising centers unwillingly, and often as a last resort.  The reason?
They 
told me that they were often given wrong information, or incomplete 
information, and that in some cases this cost the students considerable
loss 
in terms of tuition money and "wasted semesters."  On the other side of
the 
coin I learned from my colleagues (and from my own experience) that the 
counseling and advising facilities at the community college were not
what 
they might be.  As I recall, we advisors/counselors were in a
"round-robin" 
kind of arrangement, where the emphasis was on how many students you saw
in 
one hour, as opposed to how many students were advised/counseled
correctly. 
There were also many discrepancies between what I knew to be "best
practice" 
and what I saw going on.  And, it was at this same place that I saw with
my 
own eyes the fallout from poor counseling in the form of student angst, 
depression, and so on--some of it most serious.

It is my idea now (and especially in light of the disappearing
traditional 
American family system) that counseling/advising should begin in the
early 
years of education, and indeed during the 8 years of my pilot studies
with 
several area public elementary schools I provided just that.  I was 
responding in some part to the argument of whether schools should take
on 
the roles of family and parenting.  It was my idea that this argument
was 
moot, as the schools were already in that position--for better or worse.

Therefore, as part of my program, I incorporated a counseling/advisement

module to my model for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders, although the emphasis
was 
on the 3rd grade.  The result was significant and impressive, for the
very 
young students saw for themselves the road before them, and among other 
things learned about making wise choices.  Now, in my practice, I help
my 
adolescent and adult clients revisit the territory that might have been 
covered by counselors and advisors at an earlier time.  The details or
our 
success rate are fascinating, and again support my earlier theories and 
findings.

Thanks again for sharing your information.  Again, I invite you to
review my 
work and website for additional information on what I do and how my 
background and education now services my community.

All best,

Hey, has anyone read (or re-read) these articles? The first describes
differentiated instruction, with examples, references and a list of web
resources. The second describes one teacher's successful experience
using differentiated instruction with an extremely multilevel class. 

What forms of differentiated instruction have worked for you?

Hi Everyone,

This week's FOB Article-of-the-Week is from Volume 5B. Last week we
looked at Differential Instruction, and to follow that, this article
looks at different theories of adult learning and development, and what
this means in terms of instruction.

Four Adult Development Theories and Their Implications for Practice
by Lisa M. Baumgartner
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=268

I know the list has been very quiet. I'd love to hear if people are
looking at these articles, and to get some suggestions for future

Hi Everyone,

Some FOB articles are called "A Conversation With FOB", and are
interviews or conversationss with a teacher or researcher who is doing
something unique. This week's FOB Article-of-the-Week is an example of
this type of article.

This brings out teacher Jereann King's efforts to address these issues
with ABE students, and what she feels adult basic educators can do to
address power differentials that interfere with best teaching practices.
The article includes a list of  resources that were helpful to her.

Has anyone out there addressed these issues with students? Please tell

Hi Everyone,
Last Week's FOB Article-of-the-Week was also posted on the Poverty Race
Women and Literacy Discussion List, and I am passing on a response from
someone on that list:

Any other comments?

Julie

*********************************************
Concerning the FOB article Daphne posted last week (see below for her
original post):
I think that understanding group and individual differences and how
these
differences can affect the learning process is an absolute necessity for
all
educators at all levels. It's not an easy task, though, to tell people
that
they have certain beliefs and values that bias their teaching and may
even
serve as an obstacle to their students' learning. And, I'm sure we all
know
that it's not easy hearing people tell us that our teaching is biased in
any
way. In the FOB article, Jereann King mentions a couple of her "ah ha"
moments that helped her understand the teachers she was working with;
one of
them was her learning about identity development. In the article, she
says
she learned that, "identities really do develop; you're not born with
them.
Life takes you through stages. When it comes down to race and class,
those
developments can shift: from not paying attention to race to wanting to
recognize how society builds on and exploits race."
These comments made me remember a couple of "ah ha" moments I have had.
The
first one was when I learned about Milton J. Bennett's Developmental
Model
of Intercultural Sensitivity. What I liked about his model was that it
addressed one's ability to understand and deal with cultural differences
as
a developmental process based on experience. It also says that,
depending on
one's experience, a person can move forward or backwards through the
phases.
(For a brief explanation, go to
http://www.library.wisc.edu/EDVRC/docs/public/pdfs/SEEDReadings/intCulSens.p
df). This was taught in the context of dealing with ESL students, so
culture
was always the emphasis.
My other "ah ha" moment happened a few years later when I was introduced
to
the concept of "the other." What I liked about this concept was that it
looked at more than cultural differences, which I thought was necessary
in a
classroom setting, especially considering that we all belong to more
than
one group, which is what makes us individuals. I sort of attached this
concept onto Bennett's continuum of cultural development because it
seemed
to fit.  
I may have oversimplified this a little, but from these two "ah ha"
moments,
I have come to believe that our ability to deal with our perceptions of
"the
other" (regardless of what we consider "the other" to be at any given
time)
develops in the same way that our identities develop: by the experiences
we
have in our lives. I think it's important to make sure that people know
that
this is a transformative process that takes time to develop. Also, I
think
it is important for people to begin this process by trying to understand
how
their own perceptions and expectations of others are based on their
experiences and that what they think they know about others is clouded
by
those perceptions and could even become a barrier to their students'
learning. 
I've had several classes that discuss diversity issues, but they were in
the
context of teaching ESL. I'm just wondering what kind of training, if
any,
ABE teachers have in this area. Also, which groups are identified in the
training- culture, gender, religious, SES, race, etc.? And, how are you
told
to deal with diversity in the classroom?

Hi Everyone,

It's time again for FOB Article-of-the-Week! In last week's article,
Jereann King mentioned the statistic about 1 in 4 African-American men
being in prison, and it reminded me of the following study, along with
some striking unaswered questions.

What are the Economic Effects of Earning a GED in Prison?
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=822
This short article from issue 7D describes a study that looked at the
economic impact of earning a GED while in prison, and the differences
between the impact on white vs. minority ex-offenders.

The article ends with a series of questions. Can anyone shed any light
on them?

I hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving!

All the best,

It?s with pleasure and sadness that I announce that there?s a new issue of ?Focus on Basics? now available at http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1150
The pleasure? It?s a great issue. The sadness, it?s the last issue.
It includes articles from a variety of NCSALL researchers on their research:
--John Strucker on the need for curriculum structure
--Steve Reder and Clare Strawn on the tendency for adults without high school diplomas to study on there own, and what that means for adult basic education. (Molly Robertson and Lauri Schoneck write about programs that capitalize on the motivation to ?self-study?)
--John Tyler on whether GED attainers are entering postsecondary education at a rate on par with regular high school completers
--Rima Rudd and Jennie Anderson on why it?s so hard to find your way around in healthcare facilities and what we can do about it
--Cristine Smith, Mary Beth Bingman, and Kaye Beall on lessons learned from ten years of disseminating research
Enjoy!

Dear Barb: 

The demise of FOB is, indeed, a sad thing.  Speaking
for myself and for my colleagues at Missoula Adult
Basic & Literacy education, I can say that FOB has
been a valuable, awaited source of information much of
which we have incorporated into our discussions and/or
into our respective classrooms. 

My FOB editorial board experience was also a high
point experientially - as much for the work involved
as for meeting you and the other members of the then
board. 

I sincerely hope that you lead other such significant,
worthwhile endeavors as FOB in the future. You have
style.

Sincerely,

Terrence,
Thanks so much. As I wrote in the editor's letter this issue, working with each and every writer and editor has been an honor.

To demystify the workings of "Focus on Basics" a bit: the articles were, for the most part, commissioned. Once we at NCSALL chose a theme, I scoured the country for writers who were doing relevant programmatic work or research on that theme. I advertised on this list for editors, and always got many more qualified people eager to participate than we could accommodate. (Note: we could only have six at most, or we couldn't all be on the conference call system at the same time.) I tried hard to make sure every state was represented at least once.

Thanks to everyone who participated in the making of "Focus on Basics" over the years. Editors read, commented, read, commented, and read and commented some more, writers drafted, revised and revised again. For six or seven years, Miriam Burt of the Center for Applied Linguistics participated as the only recurring editorial board member, ensuring that issues relevant to ESOL were addressed. And for each issue, artist Mary White came up with provocative illustrations to draw us into the stories.

All the issues are still available and largely relevant, so don't stop using them!
Barb Garner

Hello,

In an effort to continue disseminating the great information available on
FOB, I'd invite anyone on this list to suggest resources we can point to
through ColorinColorado.org -- I am re-vamping our resources area and am
compiling links to resources educators find particularly useful. While the
scope of the Web site is K-12, I had subscribed to this list looking for
information useful, or applicable, to middle and high school students. 

?Colorin Colorado! is a free bilingual Web site from PBS station WETA,
supported by the American Federation of Teachers. It's aimed at parents and
educators of English language learners. You can learn more at:
www.ColorinColorado.org/about

Thank you for all your interesting posts over time!

Sincerely,

Layla

Hello Barbara
Here in New Zealand I have always looked forward to the new issue of Focus on Basics. Even though the contexts might be slightly different from our own there was much to share and ponder about the stories and voices that populated Focus on Basics.
I have always forwarded on Focus on Basics through Workbase's electronic monthly newsletter and through the New Zealand Literacy portal.
I have used the articles in both internal and external professional development and for my own reflection  
Thank you so much for all your hard work and the time that contributors and editors gave to this important endeavour 
 
It is indeed a sad time for the sector not just in the US but internationally

Hi Everyone,

It is really nice to hear how useful Focus on Basics has been for you (even in New Zealand!) and to recognize the fantastic work that Barb Garner has done over the years to produce so many high-quality issues. (When I pass out copies of FOB at conferences, they disappear faster than the candy!) And it is also nice to hear about how you use them for training and pass on information about them to other lists.

Amid the sad feelings as this last issue comes out, I want to remind you that we do have another year of the Focus on Basics Discussion List, and have plans already for discussions with the authors of at least three of the articles from the new issue. We also plan to re-discover the past 30 issues, through FOB Article-of-theWeek, and other guest events. Please continue to share news of FOB with colleagues, and invite them to join the list if they want to discuss current articles or journey with us through the collection of past articles.

Our hope is to keep the usefulness of FOB alive for years to come. Please let me know if you have a suggestion for FOB Article-of-the-Week, so we can share your experiences with others.

All the best,

Julie

Subject: [FocusOnBasics 572] FOB Article-of-the-Week: Structure and
	Turbulence
Message-ID: <457585AE0200002D0000047D@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

Well, we must celebrate FOB's newest and last issue (8C) by proposing
its cover article for this week's FOB Article-of-the-Week. 

More Curriculum Structure: A Response to "Turbulence."
by John Strucker
http://www.ncsall.net/fileadmin/resources/fob/2006/fob_8c.pdf

This explores the all-to-frequent "attendance turbulence", and the
possible solution of offering a more structured syllabus-like curriculum
to allow ABE students to know what they miss and keep up when they have
to be absent.

This issue is newly available and only online. The above link is to the
PDF. 

What do people think of this propsed solution to "attendance
turbulence"? Do some of you use this type of structured curriculum
already with ABE classes? Do you think it helps when students have to
miss classes?

Let us know!

All the best,

Julie

Message-ID: <457EE3640200002D0000058E@mail.jsi.com>

Hi Everyone,

This week we will highlight another article from the new issue of Focus
on Basics, which looks at how easy it is for adult literacy students to
find their way around in hospitals and clinics.

Navigating Helathcare
by Jennie Anderson and Rima Rudd
http://www.ncsall.net/index.php?id=1156

This looks at the findings of teams of adult literacy teachers and
students, along with graduate students and others who tried to look for
certain places in hospitals and recorded the students responses to the
signs and maps leading them. Researchers also looked at the reading
level of signs and instructions along the way. Read about this unique
approach to studying the navigation of a system with significant
literacy-related barriers, and about the implications for adult
educators and medical professionals as they work to make healthcare more
accessible to all.

Enjoy!

Julie

Message-ID: <72D5C30B-C91D-418D-A0A3-655DA1CE971B@caalusa.org>

Colleagues,

 From time to time over the next couple of years, the National  
Commission on Adult Literacy, which CAAL manages, will make  
background papers developed for the Commission available to the   
general public. The first set of four papers -- all summary  
information papers on the role of the federal government in adult  
literacy -- have been pulled together into an informal publication  
that can be downloaded from the CAAL website (www.caalusa.org).

The papers were written for the Commission by Lennox McLendon,  
Garrett Murphy, and Jim Parker. They are titled as follows:


1.  Adult Education and Literacy Legislation and Its Effects on the  
Field (McLendon)

2.  Adult Education & Literacy in the Unites States: Need for  
Services, What the Current Delivery System Looks Like (Murphy)

3.  Introduction to Main Strands of Federal Adult Literacy  
Programming (Parker)

4.  Federal Role in Adult Literacy, FY05-06 (Murphy)


The combined document is quite large (2.2 MB) but it will download  
quickly for those with high speed connections.  For those who prefer,  
CAAL can make copies available by regular mail at $25 per copy plus  
postage (contact bheitner at caalusa.org for ordering instructions).

Happiest of holidays to you all, and a wonderful new year --

Hi Everyone,
A couple weeks ago, we featured John Strucker's article about
"attendance turbulence", looking at the prevalence of students stopping
class for a period of time, and a proposed support for this habit. This
stop-and-go attendance pattern has been studied for some years now, and
we will be discussing this concept in a guest discussion in January with
Steve Reder about his article "Concepts of Participation and Program
Support". To help prepare for this topic, I thought it might be
interesting to look at some research from 1998 and look back at an
article from issue 2A, which looks at Learner Motivation from different
angles.

Stopping Out, Not Dropping Out: 
Students and teachers may perceive withdrawing from a program
differently
by Alisa Belzer
http://www.ncsall.net/?id=417

This describes a study which followed learners until they dropped out
for a while and looked at their and the teachers perceptions of dropping
out. Please take a look at this and let us know what your impressions
are!

All the best,
Julie

REFLECTIONS ON THE FORTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE ADULT



EDUCATION ACT OF 1966



Samuel Halperin

  December 22, 2006



In November 1966, the United States took a small, but potentially  
momentous, legislative step to support a federally aided network of  
adult education providers under the Adult Education Act of 1996.  
(Technically, the Act is Title III of the Elementary and Secondary  
Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended).

Who would have guessed then that this relatively unheralded act would  
spur a national network providing education and literacy services to  
over 2.5 million adult learners annually, including one million 16-24  
year-olds, about half of whom study English as a second language?

With hindsight, making sure that adults have a second chance to raise  
their literacy skills and continue their education beyond high school  
would seem to be clearly in the public interest. Yet, this obvious no- 
brainer required no less than a massive realignment of Congressional  
attitudes, a perceived serious threat to national security, and quite  
possibly a presidential assassination to turn a simple idea into  
legislative reality.

The legislative paths to enactment of the Adult Education Act merit  
reflection in this 40th anniversary year because they demonstrate how  
extremely malleable, porous, and often quirky is the process of  
making our laws, and also because it illuminates the many  
opportunities for advocates who perceive opportunities and know how  
to seize them to make progress in the public interest.

Here are brief personal memories of those early days, as viewed from  
my experience as an executive branch ?lobbyist? for Presidents John  
F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson:*

In the early 1960s, adult educators were barely a presence in the  
halls of Congress.

?None of its advocates,? notes veteran educator Thomas Sticht, ?was  
having much success getting adult education or adult literacy  
education implemented in federal legislation.?**

Ever since the demands of World War I had revealed how poorly  
prepared for military service were so many potential recruits --  
intellectually through very low literacy as well as physically, an  
Adult Basic Education bill (ABE) had been intermittently introduced  
in Congress beginning in 1918, and then promptly ignored.

In a Congress long dominated by southern conservatives, ?adult basic  
education? became conflated with efforts by liberals and the growing  
civil rights movement to teach ?Negroes? how to pass the literacy  
tests that southern states had erected as effective barriers to the  
exercise of voting rights.  (Southerners also noted with suspicion  
that the U.S. Office of Education?s small adult education branch was  
headed, and almost exclusively staffed, by a de facto segregated  
staff of distinguished African American educators in a federal agency  
where Black senior executives were notable mostly by their absence.)

After the defeat of President Kennedy?s education proposals in  
1961-62, his Administration devised an omnibus education bill, the  
National Education Improvement Act of 1963 (NEIA), consisting of 14  
parts and incorporating everything from teacher salaries, vocational  
education, public libraries, student financial aid, higher education  
construction, and several long-languishing proposals, including adult  
basic education.  Commissioner of Education Francis Keppel, leading  
the NEIA legislative effort, knew that the entire 14-part package  
would not survive the church-state hurdles that had doomed earlier  
Kennedy proposals, but hoped that it might reduce the internecine  
warfare then prevailing among Washington?s many diverse and  
fragmented education associations.

Through hard work by House and Senate education committees headed,  
respectively, by Rep. Adam Clayton Powell and Sen. Wayne Morse, major  
parts of NEIA advanced in early 1963. But progress soon stalled as  
House and Senate chairs and various education associations quarreled  
and checkmated each other.

It took the shock of President Kennedy?s assassination and Lyndon  
Johnson?s rise to vigorous leadership to open the legislative  
floodgates.  By year?s end, major bills for vocational and higher  
education were signed into law.  Indeed, by the end of 1964, 12 of  
the less controversial parts of the NEIA had become law.

During that period, too, several developments made it conceivable  
that adult education, with its anti-poverty focus, could at last get  
attention on Capitol Hill.  In 1963, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an  
assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Labor, was struck by  
the fact that among potential draftees under the Selective Service  
System at least one-third were found unfit for induction due to poor  
health or mental limitations, that is very low levels of literacy.   
(Analysts believed that if all 18 year-olds had been examined, fully  
one-half would be found unfit.). At the urging of Moynihan, Secretary  
of Labor Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and  
General Lewis Hershey of the Selective Service System, President  
Kennedy ordered a Task Force on Manpower Conservation to develop  
appropriate plans for federal action.  The Task Force report, One- 
Third of a Nation, was delivered to President Johnson on January 1,  
1964.  The report did not call for immediate legislation, nor is  
there any evidence that it led to Congressional action. Nevertheless,  
the critical connections between low literacy, national security, and  
poverty were given new and high-level visibility in the Nation?s  
Capital.  A mood was fast developing that some kind of federal action  
was long overdue.

Then, in May 1964, President Johnson committed his administration to  
wage War on Poverty.  He directed federal agencies to suggest what  
they could contribute to the development of what soon became the  
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and its new federal agency, the  
Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO).

Assigned as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare?s liaison  
to the OEO legislative task force headed by Adam Yarmolinsky, I  
argued there that several parts of the still-pending NEIA bill had  
relevance for any effort to combat poverty, and that such  
Administration proposals as adult basic education (ABE), libraries  
and college work study could be appropriately incorporated in the  
emerging OEO bill.

Future OEO director Sargent Shriver and Yarmolinsky, however,  
rejected any targeted earmarking of anti-poverty funds, preferring to  
wield the broadest possible blanket authority to wage war on poverty  
in all its forms.  Moreover, OEO people wanted nothing to do with a  
state grant program like ABE that would, they argued, be administered  
by unsympathetic, possibly even racist, state and local officials.   
Knowing that passage of the OEO bill in the Congress depended on  
gaining the support of southerners, many of whom saw ABE as a wedge  
to undercut state literacy voting laws, ABE would have no place in  
the fast-developing OEO bill.

But legislative possibilities changed dramatically when Congress  
passed the historic Voting Rights Act of 1964.  The power of state  
literacy tests to thwart voting by Blacks would sharply decline, if  
not entirely disappear.  The mood and tactics among southern  
lawmakers shifted accordingly.  As one leading southern senator said  
in closed caucus, ?If we are going to have to let ?them? vote, we had  
better be sure they can at least read.?

In the House of Representatives, responsibility for overseeing the  
contents of the draft Economic Opportunity bill was assigned to a  
subcommittee chaired by Carl Perkins, the ranking majority member on  
the House Education and Labor Committee, who represented an East  
Kentucky district characterized by high poverty and even higher  
illiteracy.  During a meeting of Committee members and our HEW  
legislative staff to consider the provisions of the draft OEO bill, I  
raised with Mr. Perkins the relevance of including HEW?s proposals  
for ABE and college work-study.  Mr. Perkins immediately and  
enthusiastically embraced incorporating both provisions in the OEO  
bill when it was reported to the House of Representatives for its  
approval.  Despite opposition from OEO to these inclusions, Perkins  
argued that the added provisions would strengthen support for the  
overall bill.  Thus, when President Johnson signed the Economic  
Opportunity Act on August 20, 1964 (Public Law 88-452), its Title  
IIB, the Adult Basic Education Act, authorized OEO to make grants to  
state education agencies to advance adult literacy. OEO promptly  
assigned administration of the two new programs to the U.S. Office of  
Education.

On March 1, 1966, ABE and the college work-study legislative  
authorizations were formally transferred from OEO to the Office of  
Education.  These transfers were much less the result of adult  
educators? lobbying efforts than of  OEO?s desire to rid itself of an  
unwelcome burden and, more especially, of the energetic campaign of  
Edith Green of Oregon, subcommittee chairman for higher education  
issues on the House Committee on Education and Labor.  Mrs. Green, a  
formidable education leader, was strongly critical of President  
Johnson?s war on poverty and, particularly, of the powers and funds  
it conferred on the new OEO ?super-czar agency? to intervene in the  
traditional operations of many levels of government, including  
schools. Amid mounting sharp criticism of OEO?s initial ventures in  
community action and legal services, Mrs. Green met scant resistance  
to ?returning? HEW?s original proposals to the U.S. Office of Education.

Thus, forty years ago, the Adult Education Act was born, a small but  
durable foundation stone on which to build a much-needed adult  
learning system for the American people.

Today, however, research shows that 93 million Americans over age 16  
lack the literacy and skill levels needed to function effectively in  
a globally competitive, economically challenging world, one  
characterized by massive in-immigration of low-literacy workers. We  
must question whether a 40 year-old, generally under-funded adult  
education ?system,? staffed 80 percent by part-time instructors and  
often detached from the needs of cutting-edge economic developments,  
is even faintly adequate to meeting the challenges of the 21st Century.

This is clearly not America?s moment to rest on the anniversary  
laurels of 1966. Rather, we must forge ahead to help our nation?s  
children and adults become the most skilled, the most literate, and  
the most empowered generations in our national history.

Message-ID: <1166813854.1661689625.14188.sendItem@bloglines.com>

Hi all.
My program has been blessed with a bunch of used computer donations
from the Cristina Foundation. Before you get excited, these are older computers
from companies and individuals who have upgraded. For more info, go to cristina.org
if you'd like to get some for your program.

We initially used them to set
up a lab in our center, and have been giving the extras away. Since I still
have extras, I would like to give some to my pre-literate Liberian refugee
senior citizen ABE students to practice their skills when they are away from
class.

We typically reformat the computers with Windows and Microsoft Works
and an antivirus/spyware program. They will have a standard internet connection,
which we'll have to show the learners how to use.

What I'm looking for
from you are some recommendations of websites or freeware you use in your
center with your most basic level adults. If you know of some fabulous program
that costs money, let me know about it and I'll see what I can scrounge up
in the way of grant money. We are working as an all volunteer, no budget organization
so I'm ideally looking for website recommendations or better still, stand
alone software so they just need to point and click and won't need to deal
with the internet.

Thanks for your ideas!

Jean,
Read Please is a free program you can download and then cut and paste text  
into it and it will read it. This company also makes a program called Reading  
Bar. This software costs about $129.00. It is wonderful.
Also, Google has a tool called language tools. It can transcribe any web

Hi all.
My program has been blessed with a bunch of used computer donations
from the Cristina Foundation. Before you get excited, these are older
computers
from companies and individuals who have upgraded. For more info, go to
cristina.org
if you'd like to get some for your program.

We initially used them to set
up a lab in our center, and have been giving the extras away. Since I still
have extras, I would like to give some to my pre-literate Liberian refugee
senior citizen ABE students to practice their skills when they are away from
class.

We typically reformat the computers with Windows and Microsoft Works
and an antivirus/spyware program. They will have a standard internet
connection,
which we'll have to show the learners how to use.

What I'm looking for
from you are some recommendations of websites or freeware you use in your
center with your most basic level adults. If you know of some fabulous
program
that costs money, let me know about it and I'll see what I can scrounge up
in the way of grant money. We are working as an all volunteer, no budget
organization
so I'm ideally looking for website recommendations or better still, stand
alone software so they just need to point and click and won't need to deal
with the internet.

Thanks for your ideas!

The Components of Numeracy by Lynda Ginsburg, Myrna Manly, and Mary Jane
Schmitt
This occasional paper attempts to describe the complex nature of numeracy as
it exists today. While there are large-scale assessments, standards
documents, and position papers, there has not been a field- and
research-based synthesis of the components required for adults to be
numerate, to act numerately, and to acquire numeracy skills. This paper
attempts to identify and clarify the nature of these components with the
hope that such identification and clarification will guide instruction,
contribute to the design of assessments, frame research, and inform policy.

Sylvia is too modest, but if you go to this page on the Canadian equivalent
to NIFL, you will link to learner-reviewed software, and shareware, and
freeware in a project she directed at her literacy program a few years ago
and then posted it to the National Adult Literacy Database at www.nald.ca
HEre is the exact page, but there are many more resources, links to
programs, and full text documents on that site as well, as she said:

http://www.nald.ca/tools/practitioner/practitioner.htm



Many websites also have great programs for learners to use:

www.abc-canada.org has a Math Literacy website with lots of ideas and games
and tip sheets and trivia facts on numeracy

www.healthyroadsmedia.org has a multi-media presentation of common health
topics in seven languages!

Lots more...
