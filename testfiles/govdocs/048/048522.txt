   Adopted:  December 10, 2001	Released:   December 12,  2001

By the Chief, Public Safety and Private Wireless Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau:

I.  INTRODUCTION

	1.	The County of Stanislaus (Stanislaus County or the County) operates fixed microwave 
service (FMS) Station WNEJ708, Mt. Oso, California, in the 2 GHz band, and inadvertently allowed the 
license for this station to expire.  Stanislaus County has now filed a new application for the same station.   In 
connection with its application, Stanislaus County requests waiver of the Commission’s rules that would 
otherwise result in the authorization of the station on a secondary basis.   For the reasons set forth below, we 
deny Stanislaus County’s request to authorize the station with primary status.

II.  BACKGROUND

	2.	The Commission has reallocated portions of the 2 GHz band from FMS to emerging 
technology (ET) services, including the personal communications services.   To this end, the Commission 
has adopted certain transition rules.   In doing so, the Commission balanced the needs of incumbent FMS 
licensees to continue to operate their systems with the need to conserve vacant 2 GHz spectrum for use by 
ET licensees, to provide ET licensees with a stable environment in which to plan and implement new 
services, and to prevent ET licensees from bearing any additional costs of relocating FMS licensees.   
Thus, rather than immediately clearing the 2 GHz band of the incumbent FMS users, the Commission 
permits the incumbents to continue to occupy the band on a co-primary basis with the ET licensees for a 
significant length of time, by the end of which the incumbents are to relocate to other spectrum.   ET 
licensees have the option, however, of requiring the FMS incumbents to relocate sooner if they pay the 
additional costs caused by the earlier relocation.   In addition, we authorize new FMS stations, extensions 
of existing FMS systems, and major modifications of existing FMS stations only on a secondary basis to 
ET systems.   Most minor modifications of FMS stations are also authorized on a secondary basis unless 
the licensee can demonstrate that it needs primary status and that the modifications will not add to the 
relocation costs to be paid by the ET licensee.   The result is that while incumbent FMS licensees are able 
to continue operating their systems with primary status – as those systems currently exist – any 
expansions and most modifications to the systems result in secondary status.      

	3.	On July 21, 1995, the Commission granted Stanislaus County a license to operate Station 
WNEJ708.  On April 29, 2000, a renewal reminder letter was sent to Stanislaus County.   The County 
failed to renew the license in a timely manner, and, thus, the license automatically expired July 21, 2000.  
Stanislaus County states that the license was allowed to expire due to an administrative oversight during 
the transfer of responsibility for FCC licensing procedures from one person to another.   On June 12, 
2001, Stanislaus County filed an application for a new license for a station to replace Station WNEJ708.   
On August 1, 2001, the Public Safety and Private Wireless Division, Licensing and Technical Analysis 
Branch returned the application to provide Stanislaus County the opportunity to amend its application to 
request a waiver of the Commission’s rules that provide that new FMS stations in the 2 GHz band are 
authorized on a secondary basis to ET licensees.   On August 16, 2001, Stanislaus County amended its 
application to request a waiver of Section 101.81 of the Commission’s Rules.  In support of its request, 
Stanislaus County states that this path carries essential public-safety radio communication to the primary 
radio site on Mt. Oso for the Stanislaus County Sheriff and Fire Departments. 

III.  DISCUSSION

	4.	In this case, while the station at issue was originally authorized with primary status, 
Stanislaus County allowed its license to operate the station to expire.  The County requests a waiver of the 
rules so that its new license for a station to replace Station WNEJ708 can be accorded primary status.  We 
may grant a request for waiver when (i) the underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or 
would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and a grant of the requested waiver would be in the 
public interest; or (ii) in view of the unique or unusual circumstances of the case, application of the rule 
would be inequitable, unduly burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no 
reasonable alternative.   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that grant of the requested waiver 
is not warranted under the circumstances presented. 

	5.	Significantly, Stanislaus County fails to provide a detailed explanation as to why the 
license was allowed to expire or why a waiver grant is warranted under the circumstances presented.  The 
license expired as a result of Stanislaus County’s inadvertent failure to renew the licenses in a timely 
manner.  As we have done previously in similar cases, we conclude that an inadvertent failure to renew a 
license in a timely manner does not constitute a unique or unusual circumstance that renders application 
of the 2 GHz band licensing rules inequitable, unduly burdensome, contrary to the public interest, or 
leaves the applicant with no reasonable alternative.    As the Commission has expressed in other 
instances, each licensee bears the exclusive responsibility for filing a timely renewal application.   In 
addition, the Commission has determined that a licensee will not be afforded special consideration when 
the licensee fails to file a timely renewal application simply because it engages in public safety 
activities.   Thus, we find that Stanislaus County has failed to make a sufficient demonstration that grant 
of a waiver is warranted under the circumstances presented.  

	6.	Further, the Commission’s policy regarding licenses for which no timely renewal 
application is filed is as follows:  renewal applications that are filed within thirty days of the expiration of 
the license will be granted nunc pro tunc if the application is otherwise sufficient under the Commission’s 
Rules, but the licensee may be subject to an enforcement action for untimely filing and unauthorized 
operation during the time between the expiration of the license and the untimely renewal filing.   
Applicants who file renewal applications more than thirty days after the license expiration may also 
request that the license be renewed nunc pro tunc, but such requests will not be routinely granted, will be 
subject to stricter review, and also may be accompanied by enforcement action, including more 
significant fines or forfeitures.   In determining whether to grant a late-filed renewal application, we take 
into consideration all of the facts and circumstances, including the length of the delay in filing, the 
reasons for the failure to timely file, the potential consequences to the public if the license should 
terminate, and the performance record of the licensee.   Stanislaus County’s current application was filed 
nearly eleven months after the license expired.  Given that Stanislaus County bore the responsibility for 
timely renewing its license, and the Commission’s policy that renewal applications filed more than thirty 
days after expiration will not be granted routinely, we decline to waive the Commission’s rules to grant 
primary status to 2 GHz FMS stations when the licenses for those stations have expired because of a 
licensee’s inadvertent failure to renew such licenses in a timely manner absent extraordinary or unusual 
circumstances.  

IV.  CONCLUSION

7.	Based on the record in this proceeding, we conclude that Stanislaus County has failed to 
demonstrate sufficiently that grant of a waiver of Section 101.81 of the Commission’s Rules is warranted 
under the circumstances presented.  We therefore deny its request for a waiver of Section 101.81 of the 
Commission’s Rules.  We note, however, that a denial of the waiver request does not mean that Stanislaus 
County may not operate the subject station; rather, assuming the application is otherwise proper, 
Stanislaus County’s operation of Station WNEJ708 will be accorded secondary status.

Rcd at 19434-35  8.  In addition, we note that while Stanislaus County does not contend that the underlying 
purpose of the rule would not be served or would be frustrated by applying it in this case, other 2 GHz band 
licensees in similar circumstances have made such arguments.  Specifically, other applicants that have inadvertently 
failed to renew their licenses argued that re-licensing the facilities on a primary basis would not frustrate the 2 GHz 
licensing rules because it would neither add “new” stations nor increase relocation costs beyond the level 
contemplated by the Commission when it reallocated the band.  See, e.g., Plumas-Sierra, 15 FCC Rcd at 5574  6; 
Duke Power, 14 FCC Rcd at 19433  5.  We have rejected that argument, and concluded that the purpose of the 
rules would in fact be frustrated by a waiver, because the 2 GHz ruels are intended not only to ensure that the cost to 
relocate FMS incumbents does not escalate, but also to clear the 2 GHz spectrum by allowing FMS stations to lose 
primary status as those stations change.  See Plumas-Sierra, 15 FCC Rcd at 5574-75  7; Duke Power, 14 FCC Rcd 
at 19433-34  6.
