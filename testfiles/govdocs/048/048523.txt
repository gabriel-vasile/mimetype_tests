Subject:  Minors Must Now Apply In Person To Renew U.S. Passports

The rules on how to apply for a U.S. passport have changed, requiring more people to apply in person and allowing fewer people to apply by mail.  Under the new rules, only adults who were issued a ten year passport on or after their 18th birthday may apply for a renewal passport by mail.  All others must appear in person.  This change is effective worldwide immediately and is not specific to Japan.

New Rules for US Passport Application
---------------------------------------------------

   -- If the applicant is under age 14, including newborns, s/he must apply in person accompanied by at least one parent.  Rules regarding both parents agreeing to passport issuance have not changed and include the need for photo ID for the parents and an original birth certificate for the child; see http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7130i.html.  If both parents do not apply in person with the minor, then the absent parent must consent to passport issuance in writing.


   -- If the applicant is age 14 or older without a full validity passport issued at age 18 or older, s/he must apply in person but does not have to be accompanied by a parent.


   -- If the applicant is applying for a first-ever passport, or a replacement for a lost or stolen passport, s/he must apply in person regardless of age.


   -- Only if the applicant can produce a full validity passport issued at age 18 or older can s/he apply by mail.  All others must apply in person.


Full details, including downloadable application forms, are available at http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7130c.html.  To find out which of our offices serves your part of Japan (along with directions and our opening hours), please visit http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7123.html.


Waiver of this personal appearance by minors is available under only the most extreme circumstances where travel to the Embassy or Consulate would pose a serious and unusual hardship, or a clear risk to the minor's health, safety or welfare.  A doctor's letter and advance permission from the Embassy or Consulate are needed.  No waiver under any circumstances is available to applicants over age 14, or for any first-time applicant of any age.

Some Examples
---------------------------------------------------

Q: I'm 13 and want to renew my passport.  How do I do it?  
A: You'll need to apply in person, accompanied by a parent.  The two parent agreement rules apply; ; see http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7130i.html 


Q: I'm 14 years old.  What do I do?
A: You will also need to apply in person but do not need to be accompanied by a parent.


Q: I'm 25 now, but my last passport was issued when I was 16.
A: You must also apply in person.  You can only apply by mail if you can present a full validity passport issued on/after your 18th birthday.  


Q: I'm 44 years old.  Can I apply by mail?
A: Most likely yes.  You can apply by mail if you can present a full validity passport issued on/after your 18th birthday.  An exception would be if you were a first-time applicant, or if you were replacing a lost or stolen passport, or if your passport was issued more than fifteen years ago, in which case you must apply in person.


---------------------------------------------------
For Military/DOD Dependents Only
---------------------------------------------------

   -- Military and DOD civilian dependents with access to base facilities may make their personal appearances before a U.S. military passport acceptance agent and need not travel to the Embassy or one of our Consulates.

   -- The requirement for a personal appearance applies to newborns as well as other categories of applicants as noted above.

   -- These requirements apply to all types of passports, including Tourist, no-fee, Diplomatic and Official passports.

   -- U.S. military passport acceptance agents are not authorized to waive the personal appearance requirement.
