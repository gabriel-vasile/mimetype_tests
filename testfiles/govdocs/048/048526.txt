Agent Tips on Flood Map Changes 
TYPE OF 
MAP CHANGE WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY 
Grandfathering Offers Savings 
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has 
“grandfather” rules to recognize policyholders who 
have either built in compliance with the flood map 
or who maintain continuous coverage. These rules 
allow such policyholders to benefit in the rating for 
that building. 
Grandfathering is available for new purchasers as 
well as existing customers. 
Always use the new map if it will provide a more 
favorable premium (lower rate). 
Your building has been designated in a highrisk 
area for flooding. 
You will be required to purchase a flood policy if 
you carry a mortgage from a federally regulated 
lender. 
If you don’t carry a mortgage, you should protect 
your home with flood insurance. National 
statistics show that you are 3 times more likely to 
have damage by a flood than by fire. 
Purchasing before the map revision allows you to 
save on insurance. 
Loyal Customers Can Keep Existing Zone (Pre& PostFIRM) 
Customers, who buy a policy before maps are 
adopted and maintain coverage, can retain the 
lowerrisk zone rate. 
Eligible customers can purchase a PRP now. It will 
renew to an X zone rated standard policy. 
Have a policy: maintain continuous coverage. 
A policy can be assigned to future new property 
owner. 
Buy now to save later. 
Renew to stay protected and save money.
