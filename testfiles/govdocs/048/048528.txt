1.   Visit SIM at the AAS Meeting in Seattle

The American Astronomical Society will hold its annual winter meeting in Seattle, 
WA, Jan 6-10, 2007.  SIM PlanetQuest will once again be represented there, as one 
of the Navigator Program missions.  If you're at the meeting, be sure to look for 
SIM in the exhibit hall.  The exhibit will be open at all times that the hall is 
open.  Stop by and chat with the staff.  We have a desk labeled "The Astrometrist 
Is In", for free consulting on your questions about science with precision 
astrometry!


2.   "Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Extrasolar Planets" - at AAS in Seattle

On the first full day of the AAS Meeting (Sunday, January 7) the Navigator Program 
will host a special pre-dinner session entitled:

   "Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Extrasolar Planets: NASA's Navigator Missions"
                                    Room 6E
             Appetizers (courtesy of Northrop Grumman) at 630pm
                               Program 645-745pm

This session will be in the form of a panel discussion.  Neil deGrasse Tyson, 
Director of the Hayden Planetarium in NYC, will begin the session, and he has 
kindly agreed to moderate the discussion for us.  Panelists will discuss the 
science of the Navigator Missions.  As the title suggests, this will be broad 
ranging, and includes much more than the planet-searches which form one of the
major thrusts for SIM.   Here is the lineup of panelists:

Neil deGrasse Tyson        Director, Hayden Planetarium
Chas Beichman              Director, Michelson Science Center
G. Fritz Benedict          McDonald Observatory, U Texas Austin
James Bullock              University of California, Irvine
Shri Kulkarni              California Institute of Technology
Wes Traub                  Chief Scientist, Navigator Program

We hope you will be able to join us for this lively pre-dinner discussion session.  
We'll finish promptly by 745pm.


3.   Reminder - SIM Newsletter distribution list

As a subscriber, you are likely already aware that in October 2006 we asked our 
readers to re-subscribe to the Newsletter.  Obviously, as a reader of this issue
(#39) you are currently a subscriber, so you need take no action. But it would
be very helpful is you could ask your colleagues interested in SIM if they have 
re-subscribed, and if not, to follow the instructions for re-subscribing.  Below 
is a copy of the announcement that went out to the (old) distribution list
explaining the need for this change.  Thanks very much for your help.

==============================

Date:    Wed, 25 Oct 2006
Subject: Important Announcement:  S I M   N e w s l e t t e r

This note concerns the e-mail distribution list for the SIM Newsletter.  We need to 
make some changes in the administration of the list.  This will require every user 
to renew their subscription.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but we need to do 
this for reasons of increased security, and to reduce spam activity associated with 
our list.

We have used the same list for the SIM Newsletter since its inception back in November 
1998, and the list has accumulated a large number of now-obsolete entries, as people 
change e-mail address.  Re-subscribing is an opportunity to have a fully up-to-date list.

We are sure that you will all wish to renew, to continue receiving the Newsletter! We 
normally publish the Newsletter every 1-3 months, depending on the news we have to share.  
As stated on our website, the 'sim-announce' list is used for the SIM Newsletter and for 
no other purpose.

When you do so, please take this opportunity to set the delivery address to the exact 
address at which you normally read your e-mail.   Please avoid using address that include 
local computer names in them.  Most large institutions have e-mail systems that allow 
e-mail delivery without requiring individual computers to be up.

There are two ways to renew your subscription:

(1) at the PlanetQuest website, simply type in your e-mail address

http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Navigator/library/sim_newsletter.cfm

(2) send an email to <majordomo@s383.jpl.nasa.gov>

In the body of the message, on a line of its own, insert (supposing your address is 
jqpublic@my-isp.com):

subscribe sim-announce jqpublic@my-isp.com

In both cases, you will receive receive notification that an authorization key is required 
for subscription.  Another message will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may 
or may not be the same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a 
command found in that message back to Majordomo@s383.jpl.nasa.gov.  (This can be a bit of 
extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra email by someone who forged 
requests from your address.)

Thanks very much for your interest and support for SIM.  We look forward to continuing to 
serve you.  And if you have comments or suggestions for the Newsletter, we are very happy 
to receive them.
