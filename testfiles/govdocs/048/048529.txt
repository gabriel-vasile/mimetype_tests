1.	Extensions Without Additional Funds
        Notwithstanding Article Number 14 of the Federal Demonstration
        Partnership III General Terms and Conditions, prior written
        approval is required to extend the period of performance,
        without additional funds, beyond the expiration date of this
        grant.  The Administrative Grant Officer (AGO) at the
        Administrative Office in Block 23a of the Award/Modification
        document has authority to approve no funds extension requests
        meeting all of the following parameters:

(a) a one-time basis only; and
                	(b) for a period not to exceed 90 days; and
(c) where $50,000.00 or less of obligated funds remain to be expended.

        In other cases, where a request is outside of one or more of the
        parameters, a no funds extension can only be approved with the
        concurrence of the Program Officer in Block 21 of the
        Award/Modification document. For any no funds extension to be
        effective, a written grant modification must be issued and
        signed by the AGO at the Administrative Office in Block 23a of
        the Award/Modification document or the Awarding Office in Block
        22 of the Award/Modification document.
