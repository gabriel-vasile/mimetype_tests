NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation's share of U.S. petroleum demand in this table differs slightly from table 4-1 because this table takes into account differences within sectors in the use of various grades of petroleum-based fuel that have different joule content per unit volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
