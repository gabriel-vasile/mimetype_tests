                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>This afternoon we have the pleasure of interviewing J. Stephen Voyles, 7881 North State Road 135, Salem, Indiana, date of birth January 12, 1950. My name is Pat McClain, and I'm on the staff of U.S. Senator Richard Lugar. With me is Gertrude Stephenson who is the Washington County coordinator for the Veterans' History Project. Mr. Voyles, did you enlist into the military, or were you drafted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>I was drafted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>And where did you go when you were first drafted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>They -- of course, they had a draft office here in town, and they picked us up here with a bus and took us down to Louisville, and of course then they took us down to Fort Knox, Kentucky. I went in there and into a reception center, of course, and so then we stayed in the reception center -- actually it was I know seven other guys that left here. There was a busload of us. There was several from the community that went, and so I don't know what happened to the rest of the guys, but I know there was eight of us from this area that went that we knew one another, but when we got to the reception center, we stayed a couple of days there, and they give us our -- our clothing we needed and all those things.</p>
                  <p>I remember they took us in this one building and was telling us that we couldn't gamble and all those things we couldn't do, and they kind of shook us down and made us turn in our pocketknives, guns, anything that you had, and we had -- couldn't have dice, couldn't have playing cards or anything like that. So we sat in that room after they got through talking to us, and there was a partition behind us, but we didn't know what it was about, and we just sat in those chairs all facing the same way; and after a while they called somebody's name, and they go back, and they come back out and sit down. Well, Larry Nash, a neighbor boy, they called his name. He went back there, and after a while, he came back, and he looked pretty bad, and he passed out, just fell all over the floor. We just -- it scared us to death. We didn't know what they were doing behind the wall, and it was my turn, and I found out they was just taking blood, but Larry passed out two or three times during basic training and things. So I found out that was normal for him.</p>
                  <p>So then we got our clothing and all the things we needed which was -- it was hot, and it was heavy, and they made us carry it a long ways, so -- then a couple of days over in the reception center and went on over to -- walked over to where we was to take our basic training and new uniform on and everything, and I was -- I was put into Echo Company, and a few of the guys I knew from here were in that company with me, and so we were marching over there with all our things, and they were marching before us, of course, and they was yelling at us, and they stopped and told us how our feet should be, and I looked down to see my feet.</p>
                  <p>This guy, this sergeant, gets right in my face, about 6 inches away, and started screaming, kind of like a Gomer Pyle thing, and grabbed my hat and pulled it down over my eyes and shook my head all around and yelled at me, "Get that hat off your eyes." And I thought, Boy, what have I got into? But anyway we went on over there and got in our barracks. Of course then after that we was in normal basic training.</p>
                  <p>I guess everybody had the same thing. It was hot and hard. So after basic training, there was a couple of months, and after that -- I think it was in October that year -- orders came to go to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and that was where I took my OJT, on-the-job training. It was a big company. It was Company C, and we were all there for some kind of training, and all of us knew we were not going to be there very long, just eight weeks or something, and it was a huge company, and I was just thinking on the way in here the reason that I remember it being so big -- when we got paid, they would line us up. There was 500 people there in alphabetical order, and we had to stand there all day. It took me until, like, 4:00 or 4:30 in the afternoon to get paid because I think it was 12 people behind me, and it was an all-day thing. You can go to the restroom, or you could go eat and then come right back and stand there, but other days, you can go -- just go to formation and then go to your job, and that was just normal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>What was your job?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Mechanic, vehicle mechanic, and so I -- and what was interesting too, I had just hired on with Cummins Engine Company in January right after my birthday, and I packaged a lot of engine parts and things like that before I went, but when I got there, I actually unpackaged some of them, and we used them there because -- like the big buses, you know, with the engines in the rear, you usually see them. They're smoky and oily on the back and stuff, and those -- one of those engines would go bad. They would put a Cummins engine in. So that was interesting to see that. So that was just it. Basically I didn't overhaul any engines or anything major. I just did brake jobs, adjustments, and just that kind of work was what I was trained for.</p>
                  <p>So I stayed there in Fort Dix, New Jersey, my whole time for the whole training time which was -- should have been eight weeks, and people was getting their orders to go to Germany and Vietnam and all those places. Well, we all was fixing to go to Vietnam. That was going on pretty strong, and a lot of people didn't, but I didn't get any orders, and I don't know how many didn't get their orders, but I know that I didn't, and so I just kind of hung around and waited, and I was held over probably 30 days.</p>
                  <p>So I just got up and go to work every day and just kind of helped the guys out because I wasn't really there for training anymore. So I just pulled a lot of guard duty and drove trucks in and out for people that was working on them and things like that. I wasn't too happy about being there an extra 30 days because it was cold up there, and I just felt like I should be moving on or something, I guess. So finally my orders came for Korea, and so they sent me home for a short leave in February, and then I was to go to Korea. So mom and dad took me down to Louisville to the airport, and I got on the plane there and flew to Fort Lewis, Washington, and that was a transit station there really. People stay there for a day or two until they gathered everybody up and made us get a haircut. Every time they shipped you somewhere, they made you get a haircut. I don't know what that's all about. My hair was always short anyway.</p>
                  <p>So anyway, we left there, flew to Alaska and then from Alaska to Korea, and something I was thinking about too, it was that airplane. When we left Washington on this big airplane where you had two rows of seats on each side -- and there was some rows of seats in the middle, and it was full. The airplane was full, and when we took off, we was ascending, got way up there. It seemed like quite a ways, and all of a sudden that plane just dropped. It felt like it hit a hole or something, and we were all falling around, and the crew even fell over. They kind of stumbled around. The stewardess on the plane and the pilot -- I don't know whether he had anything to do with it or not, but he got the blame for it; and when we landed in Alaska, they had a really rough landing there too. We just bounced around again. So everybody was concerned that maybe the pilot wasn't so good.</p>
                  <p>We didn't know, but we stayed there for just a little while, whether we got fuel or what, but we wasn't allowed to leave the airport. We got off the plane for a minute until they done something, and we got back on, and then we went on to Korea, but once we got to Seoul, they picked us up in a bus and then started taking us to, like, where we was going to be assigned. I was farther on down than a lot of them. It was probably 200 miles south of the DMZ in a place called Kunsan, and there was a little town there, and you go through Kunsan, and you go on west -- Korea is shaped kind of like Florida and kind of on the -- about two-thirds of the way down on the west side is where I was stationed, right on the Yellow Sea, and you go to Kunsan the town, and then you get to Kunsan Air Force Base, and we was stationed on the Air Force base.</p>
                  <p>So -- and it sounds kind of funny, but our little battalion there of ours was to protect the Air Force base. They had their fighter pilots -- planes there, but our job was to protect the planes. We was the hot missile battalion, and just outside of the Air Force base was a little mountain. We call it an attack site, but it had all the radar and hawk missiles and everything on top of that mountain, and it's probably 5 miles away I would say -- I'm guessing -- and on top of that mountain they kept their radar going 24 hours a day 7 days a week watching the sky. If anything would happen to come in that would threaten those planes, then our job was to shoot it down.</p>
                  <p>So we was a mobile unit too, and so that was why we were there, but we was just probably six or seven or eight Quonset huts sitting there in this little area of the Air Force base, and when -- we could look outside our Quonset huts and see the nice motel-shaped buildings that the Air Force guys had. They was like little Holiday Inns sitting everywhere, and they had pretty nice quarters over there, but it didn't seem to bother me. We didn't care. We had bunks, and all of us sat in a big old Quonset hut with little kerosene heaters in them, and we was -- we was kind of sandwiched between their barracks and the runway, and then there was the Yellow Sea. It was that close.</p>
                  <p>So where I work was the garage and the motor pool, and then there was a motor pool building; and right behind the building was a fence, and then there was the Air Force runway, and if the jet or plane or something would go through there and take off or come in, you had to hold your hands over your ears because, oh, it was loud, very loud; but all the guys from there worked up on the mountain except for me and probably two or three others. The CO stayed down there most of the time with us and then the guy who was over the motor pool and everything. So there was probably three or four of us that didn't work up on the mountain, but our job is to keep the trucks and the Jeeps and all those things in working condition. So -- and I did that. I was -- that's what I did all the time, a lot of brake adjustments and things like that because the roads was really bad. They was gravel and stone and rock -- or not just rock but mud. It would rain, and then you would have ruts. So the vehicles really took a beating, and so they -- once you got to the mountain, the attack site, everybody would drive back and forth each day, haul people back and forth. Going up you went like a corkscrew. You drove around and around until you got to the top of it, and there was -- if I remember right, there was two rows of fence around there, and the guards would walk between the fences and had their dogs in there, but driving up there was kind of neat, but coming back down was scary because coming down that hill, coming down that mountain, it was steep; and actually if you had your vehicle in too low of a gear, your back wheels would slide. So you couldn't do that. Sometimes you make your turns, and you just look down over the edge, and it's kind of scary. I don't think I seen or heard of anybody having any accidents or anything like that. So we had to have good brakes. So that was my job, to have good brakes on the vehicles and things like that. So that was -- that was what we was all about down there.</p>
                  <p>I had a lot of Koreans that -- the Korean Army actually -- South Korean Army was involved with us. There were several on the base actually on the Air Force base and our company too, and we taught them to be mechanics and taught them to work with the equipment, and a lot of the guys, the civilians, would mow the grass and clean the latrines and wash our laundry and shine your shoes if you wanted them to, things like that, you know, and they done a good job because they were -- they needed money, and if they wouldn't do it, somebody else would, and I expect you would have some other guy come by the next day and want to shine your shoes, and he done a better job. You know, you might go to him the next time, you know.</p>
                  <p>So that was something that seemed like they done a lot with the Koreans, but the Army didn't have -- we didn't have anything there. I mean, we just had our barracks and our work stations, and that's it. So we used all the facilities from the Air Force. They had the PX. They had theaters there, and actually I remember when M.A.S.H. the movie came out. They had it over on the marquee, but I didn't go see it, but it was there, and they had the U.S.O. show there one time, and they had -- what else did they have? We used their mess hall, and the food was good. I liked their food over there. You could go have breakfast. A lot of times you work all night. You could have breakfast any time of the night. So the food, I never had any complaints about that at all. I always thought the Air Force had it made.</p>
                  <p>They had all the nice things and good food too. We used all those things. I remember getting a haircut. We used their barbers, but their barber shop, actually they had Korean women to cut your hair, and you walked into the room, and they was -- if I remember right, there was four chairs, and you could go in there, and if there wasn't anybody in there, all the girls would be sitting behind their little stove waiting on the couch there, and they all wanted -- you know, just like the shining the shoes thing. They all wanted the money. So you choose which one you wanted and sit in the chair, and they cut your hair, and when it's over, they could bend you forward and massage your back and your neck and shoulders and all that, and you pay them and go on to lunch, and that was kind of different, and I remember one time too that another shop that they allowed to have on base -- see, the Air Force screened all these people and allowed them to do these things, the services, that you could buy like a jacket or something like that, have it special made, and they would have their -- I had a pair of boots, dress boots, made one time. They was shiny black, and they were a western design, but they didn't have the stitching and all that in it, and they molded them. They just measured my feet and molded them to fit, and, boy, they was nice. They were really nice boots, didn't cost very much either. Somebody stole them. So I went back and thought I would have another pair made just like them. I guess somebody else different made them because they never did fit like the first ones. I'm kind of sorry that I lost those. That's -- that was some of the perks over there. They would make things for you.</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>What did you do for entertainment other than the movies?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>I didn't do very much. A lot of the guys would go downtown, down to Kunsan, and they would go to the bars and things, but I didn't do that. I went once or twice because I knew a guy that was singing down there once. He wanted to be a singer. So I went to listen to him sing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Was he an American soldier?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, and they let him get on the stage. You could go to different bars there -- I called them bars. I guess they were bars. I didn't buy the liquor anyway. Mostly we all went for the music. You would go to one, and it would be country music, and you go to another it would be rock and roll or something, and so that was -- this guy would get up there and sing. They allowed him to sing American songs, of course, and he played the harmonica, and he was really good. But I had bought -- one time I went downtown with another guy, and we bought us a guitar, and I give $9 for it which was like -- 300 won was a dollar. So I think that was like 2700 won or something. But it was only $9. So I played that for about six months, and when I left, I sold it for $9. So I did all right there, I thought.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>I would think so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. That was interesting. So things wasn't very expensive over there. Like I said, they was pretty poor, and that's about all I can think of with something like that. The only one day that something special that I thought was special happened, we had a general come to our base, and the CO called me up there and said, "Get your best clothes and clean yourself up and go to the Air Force and get this car. I've already called -- and get this car. Go down to the helicopter pad and pick him up and drive him anywhere he wants to go." So I cleaned up and went up there and got this car, and they put -- I don't remember how many stars he had, but they put a license plate on the car that had how many stars he had, and they put one of those little flags on the car, and I drove down there and picked him up. There was a helicopter. You have to hold your hat with one hand and open the door with the other and all that, picked him up and drove him all over. He seemed like a nice guy. I don't remember what he done or anything about it. He wasn't there very long.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Do you remember his name?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>No. I don't remember anything about that. So I took him back after he was finished, and I had been used to driving these old trucks and deuce-and-a-halfs around and running up and down these old country roads, and I thought this car was nice. It was like a Ford LTD or something like that. So I just drove it around. So I turned around, you know, and -- so people was seeing that sign on the front and that flag, and they was saluting me everywhere I went. So I started getting nervous, and I was thinking, Boy, after a while -- you know, I may get in trouble for this if the right guy come along and salutes me and sees I'm just a PFC or something. I might have been selected for Spc4 by then. I don't know, but I got chickened out anyway, and I took the car back and quit for the day, but that was kind of funny.</p>
                  <p>But mostly I just worked, and then sometimes they would come and get me to make a run up to one of those northern towns somewhere, another battery somewhere to get parts for the radar or for the heavy supplies or something. So I made a lot of runs like that. So that was rough. The roads was rough, and you had to be real careful. People was in the roads or animals, chickens. You go down to a little village and see people and chickens all over the place, and you had to be careful, and they told us up front you don't want to run over the chickens or anything like that because they're really valuable. So -- and the one time I had gone north for some reason to get some supplies, I guess, and on my way back it must have been a pretty good size city because they had some blacktop roads right there in that city, and I was driving this big truck, deuce-and-a-half truck, and this guy was leading a calf along the road with a rope. So I pull over to the left side of the road to swing around him, and that calf started to run. Well, the man pulled the rope, jerked the rope to catch the calf. When he did, it spun the calf around, and he hit the side of my truck. Well, I looked in the mirror, and I seen the calf was getting back up, and he was going to be okay. So I got chickened out there again. So I hightailed it. I took off.</p>
                  <p>Well, I had to go -- I hadn't gotten quite into town yet. I was on my way into that town. I was on my way back home at that time, but I had to go through this town. So when I got into that town and I started out the other side of it, the Korean police pulled me over, and they didn't arrest me, but they took me into custody and give me a raking over the coals. I could see they was upset, but I couldn't understand a word they was saying. So there was some guy there, and I don't know why or who he is, but he kind of -- he could speak English, and he helped me through this thing. So we went back out there to the site to where this had happened. They seen where I left skid marks and things and all that, and they called my CO, and finally they let me go. He said, "You come really close to getting arrested and thrown in jail," and he said, "You don't want to get thrown in jail over here." So anyway I got back, and my CO calls me in the office, and he said, "Fill out this report and tell me about this hitting this cab." And I said, "What do you mean, hitting the cab?" He said, "Well, you got to give me a call about hitting the cab." "No. It wasn't a cab, taxicab. It was a calf." "Oh, I thought all this time you hit somebody in a car or something." So he was kind of upset until he heard that. And he said, "Well, okay. We'll take care of it."</p>
                  <p>So I was all right, but I made several runs in the nights and things like that. It seemed like when something would break down, it would be during the night. I don't know why. They had little narrow bridges, one-laners really, and then there's the little old trucks that they had. If anybody had a truck, it was a little three-wheeler. It almost looked like an oversize golf cart. It had one wheel in the front and two in the back, and they would always overload them with things, and we both started into a bridge at the same time. It was an arch-type bridge, and we didn't see each other until we got there, and I was in a Jeep, and the brake pedal had hit the floor, so all I had was my hand brake, and I got stopped just before I hit him, so -- and then another time I broke down on the road, and we used a lighter to see to work on the engine in the night. So we got -- so there's several times I was out and had some problems but nothing real serious, just things, you know, that was -- I know, one time we went to Seoul because we delivered a guy. I don't know why he was getting out of the service -- seems like he was getting a dishonorable discharge or something -- but we had him in the back, and he and I and another person was in the back of this deuce-and-a-half truck, and we had the canvas rolled back, and we was standing on the front linked with our arms up on the top of the cab with the guy that was driving along right through town, and we kept hearing this horn blow behind us, and we didn't know what was going on. So we turned around and looked, and these -- we called them slicky boys. These guys had jumped in our truck and climbed in the back and threw out a bunch of the things that was back there and got away. We didn't even know it. There was three of us standing there, and they did it right behind our backs, and the people behind us was in the taxi, and they was honking the horn at us trying to tell us, but they could have slit our throat or anything, and we never knew anything. They called them slicky boys, and they were slick.</p>

                  <p>What was in the back of the truck?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>His -- his clothing and things like that, luggage and things and some other things. I don't remember what else, lost everything. But they just slipped right out of there. So sometime during that time I was over there -- I don't know just when, but it seemed like it was August -- I got the Soldier of the Month Award, and I don't really know what that means. I got -- it was supposed to have been in the paper back home. Whether it was or not, I don't know, and I got specialist fourth class while I was over there, didn't quite have time to get -- they had put me in for E-5, but I didn't have enough time left.</p>
                  <p> So that's about it on that. When it was time for me to come home -- I mentioned earlier that I had to stay over in Fort Dix, New Jersey, an extra month. The Lord was working, and I didn't know it, and I stayed that extra month there, and when it come time for me to come home, I got my orders to come home, and they said, "Well, you got less than 150 days. You lack 4 days of having 150 days left in the service. So we're not going to reassign you. We're just going to let you go ahead and get an early out and go on home." So staying over that month in New Jersey caused me to get out of the service six months early which was pretty nice. So when I left there, the Air Force had -- they had these little planes that you could -- you could ride. Mostly they weren't passenger planes, and they did have a 12-seater -- I think a 12-seater, and I caught a ride down there to Kunsan Air Force Base so I didn't have to ride in a deuce-and-a-half back up there to get back.</p>
                  <p>So when I left, I flew out there and got on a regular plane, and then we went from there to Japan, and I don't know whether they fueled or what they did to go on the rest of the way, but we stopped in Japan and just (Inaudible.) but same way, we wasn't allowed to leave the building, just go in the airport there and wait until they fueled or whatever and went on back to Fort Lewis, Washington, before we mustered down and give us our pay and all these things, and I probably went two or three days without getting any sleep because we moved. By the time you thought you could get some rest, you had to go somewhere else. So I didn't get any rest. So when I was -- when I left Washington, this stewardess, they was -- the plane was, like, a third loaded, and she come back to check on me and said, "You look kind of tired. Do you want to lay down?" And I said, "No. I'm fine." She said, "No. I'll take care of that." So she took the armrest out of the seats and got me a pillow and blanket and kind of insisted that I lay down. Boy, I just slept the whole way, I guess.</p>

                  <p>Slept like a baby?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. So I really appreciated her and got a little rest and got home. So --</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Did you come back to Salem?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Come back to Salem. Actually my folks picked me up in Louisville, and then I come back and hung around here for a while, but another thing too that happened, I hired on at Cummins in January, and since I worked six months, they allowed my seniority to go on. Well, see that's another thing I didn't know would happen, you know, and so that was another thing I think the Lord was working in, and so I came back, and I had two years, over two years seniority with a company that I only worked six months at. So they gave me a little time to rest up and recuperate and come back, and I went back and worked for them. So that worked out really good.</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Did you do the same thing at Cummins?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I was -- no. I've had several jobs there. Mostly Cummins I ran the machines where -- I was the machine parts, (Inaudible.) engine or something, pistons, something like that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Did your training with the military help you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>It didn't?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>No, and I wonder sometimes if that isn't why they gave me this mechanic's job is because they thought I work for Cummins Engine Company. There might be something there that maybe I was already a mechanic. But my cousin had done the same thing. He had worked there at Cummins, and they gave him a machinist job because he put down on his paperwork that he was a machinist, and really we weren't machinists. We were machine operators. Machinist is a different trade itself. So I don't know if maybe the military wasn't clear about that, but they give me the same type of work basically, working with parts, but, yeah, they give me my job right back. I was very happy about that.</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>And then you retired at what age?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I got -- when my 30 years was in, actually I was still 48, but in January '99, see, I would have had 30 years in. We was on a Christmas break. So I had a week off there at Christmas. So I didn't have to go back after the break. Actually I was still 48. Out of the 30 years, 2 of it I didn't even work because I was gone in the service. It worked out really well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>So what do you do now?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>I've got rental property, and I'm an elder at the church, and we -- this summer we've done an awful lot of mowing grass, but just -- just odds and ends. I've got a little upholstery shop. I work in there some. I got a wood shop. It seems like we're busy all the time. I don't know what all we do. I got a little garden.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Can you think of anything else that you haven't shared with us that you might want to share?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>No, not really. A lot of things went on, and, you know, you got to do a lot of things that you remember like the rifle ranges and all those things, but really I can't think of any. I guess everybody goes through those things. That's why I kept -- I don't know if I told you, but I kept my pocket knife when they asked me when we first went in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>You didn't tell me that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. I wouldn't give up my pocketknife, and it was just a -- it wasn't a very big one anyway. So we was at the rifle range one day in basic training, and somebody had threatened one of the drill instructors, was going to shoot him. So they had a shakedown. They wanted to see who had what in their pockets, and they found my pocketknife, and the sergeant got upset about it. He said, What are you doing with that? I said, "Sergeant, I've had a knife in my pocket ever since I was a little boy, and I'm not going to hurt anybody with it. Can I keep it?" He said, "Put it away. I don't want to see it." So I got to keep it. I was surprised. It's a wonder I didn't get to eat it. That's one reason I carried the little one so if anybody ever made me eat it I could probably get it down.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>But those big ones, you know -- he was pretty nice about that. He was upset that somebody was going to shoot him. We wasn't allowed to have any bullets left over. We shot the M- -- we had the M-14, big old rifles, and I trained on the M-16s too. Sometimes in Korea we would go out and qualify with the M-16s. I don't know why you call it qualifying because we just went out to the hill on top of the Yellow Sea, and we just shoot out into the water. I never did understand that very well.</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>So you didn't have a target?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>No. We really didn't have a target.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>What fish did you get?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>So that's about it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Were you cold in Korea?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jerry Stephen Voyles</speaker>
                  <p>Korea was pretty cold. The main thing I remember about that was the monsoon season. That was the strange -- it was cold like any winter, but it wasn't -- I tell you the coldest place I remember ever being was Fort Dix, New Jersey. I like to froze up there that winter, but Korea didn't seem to be that cold, but the monsoon season was something else. The sun would be shining, and it would be nice, and by the time you get about 100 feet from some things, here would come a big rain, and you were soaking. So we wore raincoats everywhere we went. We had a little ice. I remember we always had to run some, but when it would be icy, we didn't have to run. We didn't have very much ice. We had pretty much snow.</p>
