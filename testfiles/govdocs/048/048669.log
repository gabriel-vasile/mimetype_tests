I talked with silicon experts Mark and Satyajit, about putting silicon back in. Satyajit will call back with advice


<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 09;18;49 comment by...Ashutosh -->
Satyajit called to say lets try to put the silicon back in and see what happens. It is possible that L1 rate problem is not related to instantaneous luminosity. He will make an Elog entry. 
<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 09;19;54 comment by...Ashutosh -->
I informed Ops Manager Peter that we will put silicon back in and see what happens. He agrees. 
<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 09;20;46 comment by...Satyajit (Si SPL) -->
Now that the inst. lumi. is sufficiently low we can try putting 
silicon back in. If the problem appears we will take silicon out 
again until it is addressed. If the problem doesn't return in the 
remainder of the current store, we will include silicon at the 
beginning of the next store (under normal beam condition) as well.

<table border=0><td><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e030><pre>Dear shift crew,  
 
  Please take an ASDQ calibration when not taking data and  
BEFORE the access tomorrow morning . 
This is for saving reference data of electronics condition before 
the COT repair tomorrow.  
Please send an email to me when you are done. Many Thanks!!  
 
1. Choose "GenericCalibration" from the "Enable" pull-down menu.   
 
2. Pick your favorite partition number from the free partitions,    
 
3. Choose "Select Run Configuration" from the Parameters pull-down menu.   
 
4. Open the "Private" folder in the "Run Type Selector".   
 
5. Open the "Ambrose" folder.   
 
6. Choose "COT_ACE" (it should be highlighted) and click on "Select".   
 
7. Check if the RunType in the RunControlStatus is "COT ASDQ Test COT_ACE".   
 
8. Now you can go through the RunControl by clicking on "Partition",    
    "Config", "Activate" and "End".   
 
    If any crate misbehaves before "Activate", you may shepherd the crate.    
    If any crate misbehaves after "Activate", you should end the run and    
    shepherd the crate and restart RunControl.

I am following the L1 Trigger problem and for some runs I don't see the Trigmon slides (as for example run 264979, the current run). Is it any problem with TrigMon?

<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 11;17;05 comment by...Heather -->
Another point of info.  When I have been running L2 tests, it seemed like TrigMon was not running at the beginning-- indicating the problem may have occurred at the end of the previous run (I am not 100% sure of this).  When this happened, CO on shift had to restart TrigMon.  I do not know if this happens every time, but I suggest always checking at the beginning of each run.

Lately TrigMon crashes every now and then. Sometimes it gets 
through to save a root file and sometimes not. Pasha told us last 
evening that he would take a look at the crash details (which 
appears as a double mem delete in a d'tor).

I tried to run makeManyPlots (Xmon) for run 264978

This was a no-silicon run.  It seems to me that these programs

<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 13;47;45 comment by...jdl -->
Donatella observed that the hand-brake problems of the last evening were tied to the phi-gap muon trigger.  Above are plots of the prefred rates for various triggers in various runs.
<bl>
<li>Top left: Run 264973, phi gap trigger.  The rate starts to get wonky near 23:20 and then flies off to the crossing rate.
<li>Top middle: same run, 15 GeV single track trigger.  Similar strange behavior near the end of the run
<li>Top right: Run 264976, phi-gap trigger.  Here the rate is ~300kHz.  What's up with that.  That fact totally messed up the L1 DPS for that run, too.  Perhaps trigmon will show something for this run.  Also, in this run, the L1_TRK15 trigger was fine, so it looks like a muon trigger issue.
<li>Bottom: Normal behavior of phi-gap trigger vs lumi taken from run 264953 in the previous store.
</bl>
This is unlike behavior I've seen in the past.  The effect in the tracks in the one run would point to XTRP.  But that doesn't hold with the later runs where there was trouble.  Maybe it is a muon trigger thing.  We've never had trouble with the muon trigger.  Eric is leaving on vacation in a few hours.  I don't think we have any phi-gap trigger plots in Trigmon, but there may be a nugget.


<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 14;31;15 comment by...Satyajit -->
Thanks, JDL/Donatella, for noticing this! Do we have enough
info. to conclude if this would reappear in the upcoming store?
If so, it would help us in deciding whether to include silicon
in future runs before this issue is resolved.

<!-- Date: Sun Jul 20 13:48:24.887 2008 -->
XMon complains that L2_MET_35 has a somewhat high trigger rate 
during runs 264978-9.  It lists some triggers that gave no 
output, namely L1_TWO_TRK2_B_HAD_NO_OPPQ_LUMI_65_v1 , 
B_CHARM_L1_LUMI_80_v5 , and B_PIPI_L1_LUMI_80_v5, 
but the latter two turned on partway through the run.

<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 14;05;03 comment by...jdl -->
Trigmon does have info on XTRP.  So, I can cast blame in that direction.  Bits 13 and 14 are the phi-gap bits.  On the left is run 264976, and on the right is the reference 264953.  Note that in the bad run, several phi-gap track bits are on for each of the 14k events that Trigmon processed for that run.  Watch this canvas for trouble.  I'll send e-mail to Olga.

Yes, It looks like we have a problem in XTRP...in my way to FNAL to change that Data Board.


<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 14;22;14 comment by...jdl -->
It looks OK in the current run.  Maybe reloading it at coldstart was sufficient to fix it.

no quiet time given by MCR
<!-- Author: Ashutosh -->
<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 15;20;44 comment by...mohammad -->
this means I can not do CEM LED and CEM XEF non quiet time calibrations as both depend on CAL QIE quiet time calibration.
<!-- Comment: Sun Jul 20 15;46;28 comment by...Mark -->
Even though MCR may not give us quiet time, there is always about 15 minutes between stores where there is no beam...this is enough to do the three quick quiet-time calibrations :)

I changed XTRP Data Board #11. There is a problem in this board that was effecting the phi-gap trigger. I checked with a cosmic run  that the DB is properly connected (as far as I can check with a cosmic run).  I will be around until the beginning of next store in case of problem.

TrigMon - crashes more times.  Olga has made the observation 
that TrigMon crashes _when_the_main_run_is_stopped!!! 
Then you must go to the window and press ctlC and wait for  
about ten minutes.  Then it can be restarted.
