<h1>Today's Silicon Work</h1> 
<ul>  
<li> Handbrake installation <BR> 
We connected the handbrake to the SRC and set its registers to 
10 kicks with the same intervening interval to 1 uS before signaling 
the SRC.  Right now the SRC just counts the signals, but in the 
future it will pull CDF ERROR.  We ran a DMODE calibration to be 
sure it does not happen there, and it didn't. 
<li> 2 SRC Testing <BR> 
Since <a href= 
'http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=tsi&action=view&page=11&frame=2&anchor=11:02:43'>Greg updated the PROM</a> on partition 7, 
we wanted to do some testing with the Silicon on this partition.  So we took<ol> 
<li> the DMODE calibration on P7 
<li>  <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/java/cdfdb/servlet/RunSummary?RUN_NUMBER=167405'>Run 167405</a>: a COSMIC run with just one SRC 
<li> <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/java/cdfdb/servlet/RunSummary?RUN_NUMBER=167406'>Run 167406</a>: A COSMIC run with the nominal Silicon on one SRC, and 
the "fake Silicon" on the second SRC 
<li> <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/java/cdfdb/servlet/RunSummary?RUN_NUMBER=167413'>Run 167413</a>: A L2 TORTURE run with 
the "fake Silicon" on the test SRC behaving as the first SRC 
<li> <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/java/cdfdb/servlet/RunSummary?RUN_NUMBER=167414'>Run 167414</a>: A L2 TORTURE run with 
the "fake Silicon" on the test SRC behaving as the second SRC 
</ol> 
During all these tests, we didn't have any trouble 
with the TS-SRC protocols, so I think Andrew's new PROM is 
fine.  Also, there was only a small increase in the L1DONE deadtime between the TORTURE tests with the SRC in normal mode and the SRC in tracer mode, which means his optimization is  
good too.<P> 
We still need a PROM modification to the SRC in order to do the 
final tests (right now you cannot test without Silicon attached to the SRC, and I don't think we want "go for it") but once that 
is in place, we are ready for the next round of EOS tests.  We should perhaps take a some beam in Partition 7 in the interim 
to make sure, but now we think Andrew's PROM has 
been validated as much as we can without beam.<P> 
We did have one incident in run 167411 where RC enabled the ignoreBusy flag (automagically, because we weren't using the EVB), meaning the TS did not pay attention to the BUSY signal.  As a consequence the TS sent the SRC too many L1As, (the Silicon always uses the VRBs, so you cannot run with the TS ignoring BUSY) so the SRC pulled CDF ERROR.  When this happened we  
got <font color=red>2205</font> seperate messages like: 
<pre> 
b0cot03:Messenger:11:49:17 AM->Runtime Error 552, Event 265: No valid header for TDC in slot 8</pre> (See <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/daq/runSummary/errorlog/errorfile167411.log'>errorlog</a> for details) which makes me wonder again 
about TDCs which get HALTs immediately.  On the subsequent run 
we didn't pull ERROR and this didn't happen. 
</ul> 
That's all
