    <h2><strong>The Founding of a Laboratory and  Scientific Legacy</strong></h2>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:200px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/EOL-bust.jpg" alt="Bust of EOL" width="200" height="297" border="0" /></p>
    <p>In  the summer of 1928, Ernest Orlando Lawrence, a 27-year-old physics professor  from Yale University, joined the faculty at UC  Berkeley.&nbsp; He was the prized recruit of  Robert Gordon Sproul, secretary to the UC Board of Regents and soon-to-be UC  President, as part of a major effort to elevate UC&rsquo;s physics department to the  same lofty stature of its renowned chemistry department. After three years of  working out of Room 329 in Le Conte Hall, where he invented the &ldquo;cyclotron,&rdquo;  the circular particle accelerator that would eventually win him a Nobel Prize  in physics, Lawrence  needed a much larger space to accommodate his proposed 27-inch cyclotron.&nbsp; He also needed a much firmer floor.&nbsp; A key component of the 27-inch cyclotron was  to be an 80-ton magnet, which Lawrence  obtained from the Federal Telegraph Company.&nbsp;  The magnet was originally built to power a transatlantic radio link in  World War I but had since become surplus.&nbsp;  Working with Leonard Fuller, a UC Berkeley electrical engineer who also  happened to be a Federal Telegraph Company vice-president, Lawrence received the magnet as a  donation.&nbsp; He was less successful getting  free electrical power from PG&amp;E.</p>
    <p>The  perfect new home for Lawrence&rsquo;s  expanding research program was a two-story,  clapboard-sided wooden building, which stood adjacent to Le Conte Hall.&nbsp; It had been the site of the Civil  Engineering Testing Laboratory (CETL) but was now empty.&nbsp; Constructed  in 1902, the CETL featured a concrete floor strong enough to support the  80-ton magnet. On August 26, 1931, President Sproul awarded Lawrence  full use of the CETL, which Lawrence  promptly renamed the &quot;Radiation Laboratory,&quot; soon known simply as  &ldquo;The Rad Lab,&rdquo; the precursor to today&rsquo;s Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory.&nbsp; For his invention of the  cyclotron, Lawrence  won the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics. Because of the war in Europe, the ceremony  was held in Berkeley, rather than in Stockholm. One year  later, construction began on Lawrence&rsquo;s  184-inch cyclotron.&nbsp; Far too large to be  located on the UC Berkeley campus, this machine was built in the hills  overlooking the campus, the location of Berkeley Lab today.</p>

    <h2>Portal to a New Science </h2>
    <p>The front entrance  door to the Civil Engineering Testing Laboratory that became Ernest Lawrence&rsquo;s  Rad Lab in 1931.&nbsp; According to legend,  when the old building was being torn down in 1959, Melvin Calvin, the future Nobel  laureate chemist, salvaged the door for posterity.</p>
    <h2>The Early Cyclotrons</h2>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:250px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/cyclotron.jpg" alt="Early cyclotron" width="250" height="169" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Modern  physics is based on the ability of scientists to venture inside the atom and  explore the elementary particles of force and matter.&nbsp; This requires energy that physicists obtain through  particle accelerators. Ernest O. Lawrence opened the door to modern physics  with the invention of the cyclotron, which featured a unique circular design  that made possible the production of high energies in a machine relatively  compact in size. A cyclotron is composed of two semicircular electrodes encased  in a closed vacuum chamber and sandwiched between the poles of a circular  electromagnet.&nbsp; An electric field fills  the gap between the electrodes.&nbsp;  Particles moving across this gap are given an electrical push  forward.&nbsp; The&nbsp; magnet bends the path of the particles so  that they travel in a circle.&nbsp; This means  that the particles keep crossing through the same accelerating gap over and  over again, gaining speed and energy with each crossing. Lawrence&rsquo;s first crude cyclotron was  constructed in the spring of 1930, a pie-shaped concoction of glass, sealing  wax, and bronze. The first working model was built later that fall.&nbsp; It measured five-inches in diameter and on January  2, 1931, it was successfully used to boost hydrogen ions (protons) to an energy  of 80,000 electron volts.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>How Does A Cyclotron Work?</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/cyclotron-works.jpg" alt="Early cyclotron" width="300" height="200" border="0" /></p>
    <p>The term &ldquo;cyclotron&rdquo;  was originally laboratory slang for &ldquo;magnetic resonance accelerator.&rdquo;&nbsp; A cyclotron is composed of two semicircular  electrodes called &ldquo;dees&rdquo; because they are shaped like the letter &ldquo;D.&rdquo; These  dees are encased inside a vacuum chamber that is exposed to a powerful external  magnetic field. The application of a voltage to the two dees creates an  electric field in the gap between them.&nbsp;  When ions (charged particles) are introduced into the center of the  vacuum chamber, the magnetic field causes them to begin to move in a circular  path.&nbsp; As the ions cross the gap between  the dees and they are given an energy kick that causes them to accelerate.&nbsp; The ions cross this accelerating gap twice  during each orbit. Because the strength of magnetic field never changes, the  orbit of the ions widens each time they gain energy.&nbsp; The accelerating ions continue to spiral from  the cyclotron chamber&rsquo;s center until they reach their peak energy at the  chamber&rsquo;s outer edge. At that point, the energized ions are drawn out of the  chamber by an oppositely charged extractor and formed into a target-bombarding  beam.&nbsp; This demo model in which steel  marbles are used to show how ions are accelerated in a cyclotron is the same  one used by Ernest Lawrence in the display film.</p>
    <h2>A New Science, A New Kind of Medical Treatment</h2>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/NuclMed-XBD200606-00209-15.jpg" alt="Nuclear medicine" width="300" height="244" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Berkeley Lab is  credited with being the birthplace of nuclear medicine and the father was John  Lawrence (photo at right), brother of Ernest. John came to Berkeley in 1935 to conduct biomedical  studies with the products of Ernest&rsquo;s new cyclotron. In his first study, he  injected leukemic mice with radioactive phosphorus produced by the cyclotron,  and then went fishing; when he returned he found the mice improved. John  Lawrence presented a report on this work, which he wrote during his flight to  the conference (TWA stationery.) In 1937 he used the radioisotope phosphorus-32  to treat a patient for <em>polycythemia vera</em>,  a bone marrow disorder. It was the first successful treatment of a human  disease with radioisotopes. Berkeley Lab has also gained national renown for  its advances in medical imaging, including ground-breaking work in the  development and application of Positron-Emission Tomography, or PET scanning,  (background photo) commonly used in medical centers today.</p>
    <h2>The Bubble Chamber</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/bubbleChamber.jpg" alt="Bubble chamber" width="300" height="201" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Fill a chamber with  superheated liquid: the temperature is above the boiling point, but it hasn't  boiled yet because it hasn't been disturbed. Now shoot charged particles  through it; the liquid boils behind them, leaving trails of tiny bubbles. Put  the whole thing in a strong magnetic field that forces the particles to curve,  their direction and turn radius depending on their charge and mass. Photograph  the curving trails of bubbles and look for particles you've never seen before.  That's what Berkeley Lab researchers did with Nobel-Prize-winning success at  the Bevatron in the 1950s and 60s, using bubble chambers like this giant steel  bathtub designed by Luis Alvarez, which was filled with superheated liquid  hydrogen. </p>
    <h2>Finding the Key to Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:200px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/Calvin.jpg" width="200" height="277" border="0" /></p>
    <p>When the Japanese surrendered to end World War II, Ernest  Lawrence is reputed to have told biochemist Melvin Calvin, that it was &ldquo;time to  do something useful with radioactive carbon,&rdquo; which had been discovered in 1940  at Lawrence&rsquo;s  60-inch cyclotron. Working out of Lawrence&rsquo;s original Rad Lab, building, Calvin  used the radioactive form of carbon, carbon-14, to map the complete route that  carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis, starting from its  absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates  and other organic compounds. With a half-life of 5,700 years, carbon-14 is  ideal for tracing biochemical processes. With carbon-14, Calvin and his  research team proved that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel  the manufacturing of organic compounds, rather than on carbon dioxide as was  previously believed. For leading the research that deciphered the  photosynthetic process, Calvin received the 1961 Nobel Prize in chemistry.</p>
    <h2>The First Radiation Symbol</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:200px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/rad-sign-XBD200606-00209-13.jpg" alt="Radiation symbol" width="200" height="288" border="0" /></p>
    <p>In 1946, as the  184-inch cyclotron was being completed, Lab mechanical engineer Cyrill Orly was  asked to design a symbol to indicate the presence of radiation. Orly had seen how the  particles burst in a small cloud chamber that he had assembled earlier, and  thought that would be a good basis for the design. He developed a center dot  with three wings and made the first brass template for preparing these safety  signs. At that time there was a listing of different  colors scientists used for marking items. Roman violet was used for very  precious items, so Orly  selected this color for the symbol. For a background color he chose something  that would create an arresting contrast, so he chose sky blue. The design is  now used internationally.</p>
    <h2>Particle Detectors</h2>
    <p>In modern  physics, large accelerators and colliders, the descendants of Lawrence's original cyclotron invention, are  the first step in the experimental process.&nbsp;  The accelerator creates a high energy beam which can be used to  &quot;split&quot; particles into their sub-constituents, and create reactions  in which new forms of matter are created. The second step is the use of  detectors to sift through the debris of these reactions and identify those of  interest.</p>
    <p>On  display are components of a Silicon Vertex Detector (SVX), an extremely  high-resolution instrument which enables scientists to identify and track the  trajectories of subatomic particles that emerge out of collisions between  protons and antiprotons. The SVX was installed in the Collider Detector at  Fermilab (CDF) at the Tevatron collider in 1992. SVX was able to resolve, in  detail, the region directly surrounding the interaction point at CDF and identify  particles which traveled only a fraction of a millimeter before decaying. It  played a key role in the discovery of the top quark, announced in 1995.&nbsp; Descendants of the SVX will be part of all  the detector arrays at the forthcoming Large Hadronic Collider (LHC), the  world&rsquo;s most powerful accelerator/collider now under construction on the  outskirts of Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/particlePhys.jpg" alt="Particle Detectors" width="300" height="200" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Shown in  the display are silicon microchips (round ring) remaining from a wafer which  was sawed apart.&nbsp; The microchip here is  called the &quot;SVX-Chip&quot; and hundreds of these were used at heart of the  CDF detector. The chip, invented by LBNL Engineer Stuart Kleinfelder, measured  and processed the signals from the particles as they crossed the detector.&nbsp; The SVX-Chip was designed to operate  unaffected by the extremely high radiation levels present near the particle  collision point. Also shown is a detector &quot;ladder&quot; (long rectangular  structure) which holds SVX-Chips and three crystals of high resistivity  silicon, which respond electrically to the passage of particles.&nbsp; The crystals and the SVX chips are  interconnected by about one thousand hair-thin aluminium wires, barely visible  to the naked eye.&nbsp; LBNL physicists  assembled about 100 of these ladders for CDF.&nbsp;  The new arrays, such as ATLAS, at the CERN LHC, contain thousands of the  ladder-like elements.</p>
    <h2>The Time Projection Chamber</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/TPC.jpg" alt="Time Projection Chamber" width="300" height="213" border="0" /></p>
    <p>A prototype of a Time  Projection Chamber (TPC), a barrel-shaped detector so-named because it  identifies particles on the basis of the time it takes their signal to move through a gas. TPCs can detect and sift through  thousands of particles simultaneously. Invented in 1974, they have become and  remain the workhorse of modern particle physics experiments. A TPC serves as  the heart of STAR, a 1,200 ton detector system at RHIC, the Relativistic Heavy  Collider, shown in the photograph, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. STAR is  designed to explore an exotic form of matter called a quark gluon plasma, which  briefly existed in the first few microseconds after the Big Bang and set  the stage for the combinations of particles that make up our universe today.</p>
    <h2>Adding New Elements to the Periodic Table</h2>
    <p>There have been  fourteen atomic elements discovered here at Berkeley Lab, including element  106, which was named seaborgium for the Nobel laureate Glenn Seaborg, a pioneer  in studying the chemistry of the transuranium elements &ndash; those beyond uranium,  the last natural element on the Periodic Table.</p>
    <h2>Plutonium in a Cigar Box?</h2>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:350px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/cigarBox.jpg" alt="Cigar box" width="350" height="266" border="0" /></p>
    <p>When Glenn Seaborg  discovered atomic element 94, he named it &ldquo;plutonium&rdquo; after Pluto, our solar  system&rsquo;s ninth planet, because it came after neptunium on the Periodic Table,  named for Neptune, the eighth planet from the  sun.&nbsp; Plutonium should have been assigned  the symbol &ldquo;Pl,&rdquo; but, as a prank, Seaborg gave it the symbol &ldquo;Pu&rdquo; as in  &ldquo;pee-yew.&rdquo;&nbsp; All information pertaining to  plutonium was classified during World War II, so Seaborg could never refer to  the element by name, not even in his notebooks, hence the &ldquo;sample A&rdquo; in red  letters. Despite its toxic reputation, plutonium radiates alpha particles,  which do not have enough energy to penetrate skin or clothing, let alone  cardboard. This meant Seaborg could carry samples of his discovery in one of  the many old cigar boxes he&rsquo;d gotten from the great UC Berkeley chemist,  Gilbert N. Lewis, an inveterate cigar smoker for whom Seaborg had once served  as a research assistant.&nbsp; Seaborg shared  the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry with fellow Berkeley Lab scientist Edwin McMillan, for  their discoveries of neptunium and plutonium.&nbsp;  His many other awards include the National Medal of Science (shown here)  in 1991.</p>
    <h2>A SASSY Way  to Discover New Elements</h2>
    <p>When a beam of heavy  ions bombards a target, fragments of heavy ions, called &ldquo;recoil products&rdquo; can  be produced.&nbsp; This device, called a Small  Angle Separator System, or SASSY, made use of a dilute gas to separate heavy  ion recoil fragments from the beam of heavy ions that produced them. It was  mounted in the now decommissioned Super Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator, or  SuperHILAC, and played a key role in the discovery of several transuranium  elements, including Seaborgium, element 106.</p>
    <h2>The Greening of the Laboratory</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:250px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/tube.jpg" alt="Greening of the Laboratory" width="250" height="342" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Since the 1970s,  Berkeley Lab has been a leader in the development of &ldquo;green&rdquo; technologies that  have saved our nation billions of dollars in energy costs over the years. One  of the most successful programs has been energy-efficient &ldquo;smart windows,&rdquo; that  allow light in but block too much heat entering in the summer or escaping in  winter. The lab also designed software that architects and planners can use to  build more energy efficient buildings. The building in this picture was designed with the help of EnergyPlus, the successor to  DOE-2, the building energy simulation software that has saved billions of  dollars in energy costs. Another success has been low NOx burners, which  significantly reduce the emission of nitrogen oxide gases from the combustion  of natural gas. Nitrogen oxides generate photochemical smog and haze, and their  reduction is considered a major priority for air quality.</p>
    <h2>New Tools for Data Analysis and Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Berkeley Lab has  fostered many innovations in scientific computing and networking. In the 1950s,  Luis W. Alvarez envisioned using electronic scanners and computers to read and  analyze the photographic images traced by subatomic particles in his bubble  chamber&mdash;something that had never been done before. Alvarez&rsquo; team developed the  necessary electronic devices and wrote new computer programs, and by 1968 their  Spiral Reader was analyzing 1.5 million particle &ldquo;events&rdquo; per year.</p>
    <p class="lfImg" style="width:303px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/XBD200606-00209-16.jpg" alt="Data analysis tools" width="303" height="354" border="0" /></p>
    <p>In 1974, the Lab&rsquo;s  CDC 6600 became the first online supercomputer when it was connected to  ARPANET, the Internet&rsquo;s predecessor. In 1986, when the Internet was on the  verge of collapse from congestion, a Berkeley Lab researcher, Van Jacobson,  co-developed the congestion control algorithms that allowed the Internet to  keep growing. And in 1995, Jacobson and Steven McCanne developed MBone, the  first successful software for multiparty audio and video conferencing over the  Internet.</p>
    <p>
      Today Berkeley Lab  hosts the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), which  provides computational resources and services to more than 2000 scientists  nationwide, and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), a high-speed network  serving thousands of Department of Energy scientists and collaborators  worldwide. NERSC&rsquo;s newest supercomputer is Bassi, a 976-processor IBM p575  POWER5 system. Bassi has a theoretical peak performance of 7.4 trillion  floating-point operations per second and has 100 trillion bytes of disk  storage. The machine is named in honor of Laura Bassi, an eighteenth-century  physicist and the first woman to officially teach at a European university (Bologna).</p>
    <p><strong>Semiautomatic Spiral Reader:</strong> This reader could analyze up to 150 bubble chamber events  an hour (1968). </p>
    <p><strong>Nameplate from CDC 6600 serial number 9</strong>: This supercomputer, located at Berkeley Lab, was the first  supercomputer connected to ARPANET (1974).</p>
    <p><strong>CDC 7600 module: </strong>A  processing unit from the CDC 7600, which contained a central processing unit  and a number of peripheral processing units. This 1971 supercomputer had a peak  speed of 36 million floating-point operations per second. </p>
    <p><strong>The CDC 38500 tape cartridge</strong> <strong>(1976):</strong> This  cartridge held 8 million bytes of data (left); the entire system held 16,384  cartridges. The magnetic disk (rear) stored 300 million bytes. Today&rsquo;s  pocket-sized USB flash drives contain up to 2 billion bytes.</p>
    <h2>How Does a Spark Chamber Work?</h2>
    <p class="rfImg" style="width:300px"><img src="../assets/img/exhibit/box.jpg" width="300" height="211" border="0" /></p>
    <p>When an electrically charged particle passes through matter it knocks a few electrons loose from the atoms of the material. The electrons are free to wander around for a very short time before they get reattached to the atoms. If the material is a gas and we apply a high voltage across the gas while the electrons are free, a spark occurs at the point where the particle passed.</p>
    <p>The chamber has a number of parallel Aluminum plates with Neon gas between them. Just above and below the chamber are scintillation counters. Each produces an electrical pulse whenever a charged particle passes through it. A coincidence circuit checks to see if there is a pulse from both counters at the same time. If thenre is, it means there is a good chance that a cosmic ray particle has just passed through the chamber. The circuit then tells the high voltage switch to turn on 10,000 volts between alternate Aluminum plates. Most of the time, a cosmic-ray muon has passed through the chamber.<br />
