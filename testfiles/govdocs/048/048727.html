<p>Japan Recognizes U.S.-Grademarked Lumber </p>

<p>By recognizing U.S.-grademarked lumber for importation into Japan, Japan's Ministry of Construction took an important step toward further opening that country's housing market to U.S. construction techniques and materials, and toward lowering Japan's exorbitant housing costs. &quot;We are pleased that Japan has promptly implemented its commitment to permit importation of U.S. grademarked lumber,&quot; said U.S. Trade Representative-Designate, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky. &quot;Our dialogue on wood products market access issues with Japan has resulted in meaningful progress over the last year, and we look forward to additional progress in the course of this year. USTR has worked closely with U.S. wood products industry and with the support of the Department of Agriculture to achieve improved market access in Japan. These efforts are paying off. &quot; </p>

<p>Japan's commitment is consistent with its March 1996 Emergency Program for Reducing Housing Construction Cost, as well as with the 1990 bilateral agreement concerning market access for wood products which calls for progressive liberalization. As part of the Emergency Program, Japan is reviewing a host of regulations which act as barriers to imported building materials. Important further steps to implement housing deregulation measures are expected this spring that move Japan's building standards toward performance based criteria. Resolution of a host of issues raised by U.S. producers was achieved over the last year through the U.S.-Japan Sub-Committee on Wood Products, co-chaired by USTR and Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, established under the 1990 bilateral agreement. </p>

<p>Japan's recognition of visually graded U.S. lumber will enable more than 1,000 mills to ship lumber to Japan. Japan is already the largest U.S. export market for wood products, with softwood lumber exports of $619 million in 1995. Until now, only 80 U.S. mills specifically certified for use of the Japanese Agricultural Standard grademark could ship their product to Japan. American-style 2x4 construction technique now accounts for only 12 percent of Japanese wood housing construction, but its proven safety record and affordability are making it increasingly popular. </p>
