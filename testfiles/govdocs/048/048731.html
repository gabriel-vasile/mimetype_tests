<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ARTICLE I<br>
ACTIONS BY THE UNITED STATES</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. This Agreement is intended to ensure
that there is no material injury or threat thereof to an industry
in the United States from imports of softwood lumber from Canada.
Domestic producers accounting for more than 60 percent of the
total U.S. production of softwood lumber, within the meaning of
19 U.S.C. 167la(c)(4)(D) and 1673a(c)(4)(D), have submitted the
letters attached at Annex I and the Department of Commerce will
rely on the representations contained in those letters. Title VII
of the <em>Tariff Act of 1930 </em>sets out possible independent
additional grounds on which the Department may dismiss a petition
if the Department finds such grounds exist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. The United States shall not
self-initiate an investigation under Title VII of the <em>Tariff
Act of 1930, </em>as amended. or any successor law, with respect
to imports of softwood lumber from Canada. If a petition is filed
under Title VII of the <em>Tariff Act</em> <em>of 1930, </em>as
amended, or any successor law, with respect to imports of
softwood lumber from Canada, the Department of Commerce shall
dismiss the petition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. The United States shall not take action
under sections 201-204 of the <em>Trade Act</em> <em>of 1974, </em>as
amended, or any successor law, with respect to imports of
softwood lumber from Canada.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. The United States shall not take action
under section 204 of the <em>Agricultural Act</em> <em>of 1956, </em>as
amended, or any successor law, with respect to imports of
softwood lumber from Canada, except as required for the
collection of permit numbers under Article IV(I)(1).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>5.</em> The United States shall not
initiate an investigation or take action under sections 301-305
of the <em>Trade Act of 1974, </em>as amended, or any successor
law, with respect to imports of softwood lumber from Canada.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ARTICLE II<br>
CANADIAN EXPORT PERMIT</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Canada shall place softwood lumber on
the Export Control List under the <em>Export</em> <em>and Import
Permits Act, </em>as amended, and require a federal export permit
for each exportation to the United States of softwood lumber
first manufactured in the province of Ontario, Quebec, British
Columbia or Alberta and shall require any person to which such a
permit is issued to keep records relating to its issuance for 60
months after the date of issuance of the permit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Canada shall collect a fee on issuance
of a permit for export to the United States of softwood lumber
first manufactured in the province of Ontario, Quebec, British
Columbia or Alberta for quantities above the established base in
a given year. The fee shall be determined in accordance with the
following schedule:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Exports (Yearly) Fee</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) 14.7 billion board feet (the
established base) or less Free</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(c) Amounts in excess of 15.35 billion
board feet US$100 per thousand board feet (the upper fee base)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. The fees described in paragraph 2 shall
be adjusted for inflation on April I each year, beginning in
1997, based on the annual percentage change in the simple average
of the annual value in:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) the Consumer Price Index, All Urban
Consumers, All items less food and energy, published by the U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) the Consumer Price Index for Canada,
All-Items, published by Statistics Canada, catalogue no.

year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Prior to the beginning of each year,
Canada shall allocate the established base and the lower fee base
for that year among Canadian softwood lumber exporters, except
that Canada shall make every effort to make the allocation for
the first year of this Agreement by July 1, 1996, but in no event
later than September 30, 1996.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">5. Subject to paragraph 9, until Canada
makes the first allocation referred to in paragraph 4, Canada
shall collect the fee under subparagraph 2(b) during a calendar
quarter from each exporter who exports softwood lumber first
manufactured in the province of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia
or Alberta to the United States following the date on which
exports from Canada in that quarter equal or exceed 28.75 percent
of the established base (excluding any additional quantities of
exports allowed under Article III -Trigger Price). For quantities
in excess of 650,000,000 board feet that are subject to a fee
under this paragraph, Canada shall collect the fee set out in
subparagraph 2(c), in lieu of the fee set out in subparagraph
2(b).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Subject to paragraph 9, upon allocation
by Canada of the established base and the lower fee base among
Canadian softwood lumber exporters, Canada shall collect the
applicable fee under subparagraph 2(b) or (c), as determined in
accordance with paragraph 7, during a calendar quarter from each
exporter of softwood lumber first manufactured in the province of
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta whose exports to the
United States in that quarter exceed 28.75 percent of its yearly
allocation of the established base (excluding any additional
quantities of exports allowed under Article III -Trigger Price).
The fee shall apply with respect to the quantity of the
exporter's exports of softwood lumber to the United States during
the calendar quarter that exceeds 28.75 percent of the exporter's
yearly allocation of the established base (fee quantity).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">7. The exports on which a fee is payable
under paragraph 6 shall be deemed to be exports within the lower
fee base set out in subparagraph 2(b), except that if the sum of:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) the exporter's fee quantity for the
then calendar quarter, and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) the exporter's fee quantities in
previous calendar quarters of the same year exceeds the exporter's lower fee base allocation,
such exports, to the extent of the excess, shall be deemed to be
exports within the upper fee base set out in subparagraph 2(c).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">8. Canada may remit, following collection:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) at the end of a calendar quarter, fees
collected under paragraph 6, to the extent that such fees were
collected on exports of softwood lumber to the United States not
in excess of 28.75 percent of the established base;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) at the end of the year, one-half the
amount of the fees collected under paragraph 2, if exports of
softwood lumber to the United States did not exceed 28.75 percent
of the established base in any calendar quarter of that year, to
the extent that such fees were collected on exports not in excess
of the established base;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(c) at the end of the year, one-third the
amount of the fees collected under paragraph 2, if exports of
softwood lumber to the United States exceeded 28.75 percent of
the established base in any calendar quarter of that year, to the
extent that such fees were collected on exports not in excess of
the established base.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The quantity of exports for which fees have
been remitted under subparagraph (a) shall be counted against an
exporter's allocation of the established base, up to the point
that the exporter has used up its allocation of the established
base, in which case all further quantities shall be counted
against the exporter's lower fee base allocation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">9. Canada shall not be required to collect
a fee under paragraph 5 or 6 at any time from an exporter:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) whose production of softwood lumber was
less than 10 million board feet in the previous calendar year, or</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) whose production of softwood lumber
during the preceding calendar quarter was substantially disrupted
(i.e., reduced by at least 25 percent by comparison to the same
quarter of the previous year) due to a worker strike. or a mill
fire. forest fire or other <em>force majeure</em>, provided that
Canada provides notice and documentation to the United States
within 60 days following the event,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">10. The fees collected under this article
shall be calculated based on the prevailing conversion rate of
the Bank of Canada as published in the Bank of Canada Daily
Memorandum of Exchange Rates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">11. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
the transferability of allocations referred to in paragraph 4
between exporters of softwood lumber first manufactured in the
province of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ARTICLE III<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. For each calendar quarter that the
average price per thousand board feet as published in <u>Random
Lengths</u> for Spruce-Pine-Fir, Eastern, Kiln Dried, 2x4 random
length, Standard &amp; Better, Great Lakes delivered, equals or
exceeds:</font></p>

the period April 1, 1996 through March 31, 1998, or</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) US $410, in any subsequent calendar
quarter, Canada may export to the
United States, without a fee, 92 million additional board feet of

the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
(Bureau) to visit the premises of the exporter to review the
records referred to in Article II (1) and the premises of the
manufacturer of goods at issue, in order to ensure compliance

Customs Service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Nothing in this Agreement shall be

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Consultations</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Either Party may request in writing
consultations with the other Party regarding any matter referred
to in subparagraph 16(a) or (b) or that the Party considers may
constitute a breach of this Agreement. Consultations shall
commence within 20 days of the date following delivery of the
request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. The Parties shall make every attempt to
arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter
through consultations. To this end, the Parties shall:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) provide sufficient information to
enable a fall examination of the issue:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) treat any confidential information

third party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Referral to Arbitration</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. If, within 35 days following the
delivery of a request for consultations, the Parties fail to
resolve a matter that the requesting Party considers to
constitute a breach of this Agreement, other than the taking of
an action by the United States inconsistent with Article 1, the
requesting Party may initiate arbitral proceedings by delivering
written notice of arbitration to the other Party. The notice
shall specify the nature of the alleged breach. Arbitral
proceedings may not be initiated or proceed with respect to any
matter that has been referred to an auditor under paragraph 16,
except where such matter has been referred to an arbitral panel
under paragraph 17.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Appointment of Arbitral Panel</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Arbitral panels shall be composed of
three panelists who may be selected from any of the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) the WTO indicative list of governmental
and nongovernmental panelists;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) the roster established under Article
1124(4) of the NAFTA; and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(c) the roster established under Article
2009(l) of the NAFTA.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">5. The Parties shall endeavour to agree on
the panel chair within 15 days following the date of delivery of
the notice of arbitration. If the Parties fail to agree on the
selection of a chair by that date, the Parties shall decide by
lot which of them shall select the chair. That Party shall select
the chair within five days thereafter from among those roster
members who are not citizens of that Party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Within 10 days after the panel chair is
selected, each Party shall select a panelist from among those
roster members who are citizens of the other Party. If a Party
fails to select a panelist within the time periods specified, the
panelist shall be selected by lot from among the roster members
who are citizens of the other Party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">7. Panelists shall be independent of, and
not be affiliated with or take instructions from, a Party,
including a state or provincial government. Panelists shall be
selected strictly on the basis of objectivity, reliability, sound
judgment and to the extent possible, expertise appropriate to the
substance of the matter in dispute. Panelists shall comply with
the <em>Code of Conduct for Dispute Settlement Procedures under
Chapters</em> <em>19 and 20 of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (&quot;Code of Conduct&quot;, </em>and in particular
shall be free of any conflict of interest or appearance of such a
conflict.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">8. If a Party believes that a panelist is
in violation of the <em>Code of Conduct, the</em> Parties shall
consult and, if they agree, the panelist shall be removed and a
new panelist shall be selected in accordance with this article.
If a member of the arbitral panel withdraws from the panel prior
to completing his or her duties, a replacement panelist shall be
appointed in the same manner as the panelist who has withdrawn
from the panel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">9. The remuneration of panelists, their
travel and lodging expenses and all general expenses of the panel
shall be borne equally by the Parties. Panelists shall be
remunerated and their expenses paid in accordance with the rates
established by the NAFTA Commission for panelists appointed to
dispute settlement panels under the NAFTA. Each panelist shall
keep a record and render a final account of his or her time and
expenses, and the panel shall keep a record and render a final
account of all general expenses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Submissions</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">10. Within 15 days following the
appointment of the third panelist, the complaining Party shall
deliver to the panel and to the responding Party a written
submission outlining its position and all documents relied on in
support of its claim, which may include information supplied to
the Party by industry representatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">11. Within 20 days following the receipt of
the submission, the responding Party shall deliver to the panel
and to the complaining Party a written counter-submission
outlining its position and all documents relied on, which may
include information supplied to the Party by industry
representatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">12. The arbitral panel shall conduct the
arbitration in the manner it considers appropriate, including
establishing procedures to ensure the protection of confidential
information and relating to matters such as the participation of
experts and whether oral hearings should be held.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Decision</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">13. No later than 30 days after it receives
the counter-submission, the arbitral panel shall issue a written
decision, together with its findings and reasons therefor, with
regard to whether the matter complained of constitutes a breach
of this Agreement. The decision shall contain no recommendation
or instruction to the Parties. A decision of the arbitral panel
shall be by majority vote and based on the votes of all members
of the panel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">14. Where the arbitral panel finds that the
responding Party has breached this Agreement, the arbitral panel
shall provide in its decision a reasonable period of time for
that Party to cure its breach. The period established shall be
the shortest reasonable time period feasible. If the Parties have
not agreed by the expiry of that period that the breach has been
cured, the complaining Party may request the panel to decide
whether the breach has been cured by delivering the request in
writing to the panel chair and, concurrently, to the responding
Party. The panel shall issue its decision within 15 days after
the request is delivered. Paragraph 12 shall apply to proceedings
initiated under this paragraph.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Referral to Auditor</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">15. At the request of either Party, the
Parties shall appoint an independent accounting firm
(&quot;auditor&quot;) to examine data furnished by the Parties
regarding exports from Canada to the United States of softwood
lumber pursuant to a request under paragraph 16. The Parties
shall ensure that the auditor is free from any conflict of
interest, or appearance of conflict of interest, and shall
require the auditor to protect any confidential information
furnished to the auditor by the Parties. The costs of the auditor
shall be bome equally by the Parties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">16. At any time after a Party requests
consultations under paragraph 1, a Party may request in writing
that the auditor provide an opinion:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) regarding whether Canada has failed to
comply with its obligation to collect fees with respect to
exports of softwood lumber first manufactured in the province of
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta, as provided under
Article II; or</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) where both Parties agree, regarding
whether a Party has failed to comply with the Agreement in some

the issue, the auditor determines that there are questions of
interpretation of this Agreement that are essential for its
decision and that it considers it is not competent to resolve, it
shall so advise the Parties. In any such case, the auditor shall
make such findings as are practicable regarding the matter. A

culmination of months of hard work by our two Governments, the

Senior Counsel and Negotiator<br>

Washington, D.C. 20506
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Ambassador Shapiro,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am writing with respect to several issues
related to the softwood lumber negotiations. Firstly, with regard
to the confidentiality provisions of the Softwood Lumber
Agreement (&quot;the Agreement&quot;) and in particular Article
VI(i), Canada and the provinces provided a variety of
confidential information to the United States throughout the
course of the softwood lumber consultative process and during the
negotiation of the February 16, 1996 agreement in principle.
While such information is no longer relevant to the Agreement, it
was given to the United States in confidence on the understanding
that it would provide the basis for the agreement in principle.
Canada is designating this information as confidential and
expects that all such information in the possession of the United
States Government as of the effective date of the Agreement will
henceforth be treated as such by the United States under the
terms of the Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With regard to the commitments that were
made by the provinces in the context of the February 16 agreement
in principle, Canada reconfirms that Ontario, Quebec, British
Columbia and Alberta have no obligation under Article VII(2) to
implement or maintain any of the measures relating to timber
pricing and forest management systems that they may have agreed
to implement after January 1, 1996 as part of that exercise.
During the course of the negotiations leading up to the
Agreement, some of these provinces indicated that, in spite of
having no obligation to do so, they may nevertheless go ahead
with certain of the changes. In the event that they do, neither
the implementation, maintenance nor withdrawal of such measures
would provide any basis for the initiation of a dispute
resolution proceeding under the Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Further with regard to Article VII(2),
Canada would also like to confirm its understanding that the
provision applies to provincial and state measures, as well as to
federal measures. Canada is further of the view that in
determining whether measures have circumvented the commitments
set out in the Agreement, individual measures should not be
considered in isolation, but only in the context of a complete
package of measures that may have been introduced and that are
maintained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yours sincerely,</font></p>

Ambassador</font></p>
