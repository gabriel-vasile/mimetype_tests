<P><b>SUMMARY</b></P>

<p align="justify">A 47-year-old male truck driver (the victim) died when a load
of lumber he was delivering fell over and crushed him.  The victim
had delivered the lumber to a residential neighborhood where a
large family home was being built.  The contractor at the jobsite
stated that the victim had rolled the lumber (plywood) off the back
of the truck, and that the wood had landed vertically on the
pavement.  The load contained 174 sheets of plywood and weighed
10,022 pounds.  The victim got out of the truck and spoke briefly
with the contractor before returning to the area where the plywood
was located.  The contractor last saw the victim crouching beside
the lumber which was leaning at approximately a 60 degree angle. 
He thought the victim may have been placing a couple of 
two-by-fours (stickers) under the stacks of plywood just before the stack
of plywood fell on top of him.  The contractor heard a loud crash
and felt the vibration when the plywood hit the ground.  He
discovered the victim beneath the stack of plywood and called out
for help from some of his workers.  The workers came over to assist
the victim using a car jack and two 4&quot; by 8&quot; inch pieces of lumber
to lift the plywood from the victim.  Paramedics were summoned to
the scene and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene.  The
FACE investigator concluded that, in order to prevent similar
future occurrences, employers should:</P>

<ul><b>
<P><li>consider equipping their trucks with forklifts or bed-	mounted
cranes so that heavy loads of lumber can be safely unloaded.</li>

<P><li>provide formal safety training for truck drivers and educate
them about the potential hazards of their jobs, in 
particular those associated with unstable loads.</li>

<P><li>consider purchasing trucks that allow a load of lumber to be
unloaded at a delivery site in a controlled manner.</li>
</b></ul>

<P><b>INTRODUCTION</b></P>

<p align="justify">On November 22, 1995, a 47-year-old male truck driver died
after the load of plywood he was delivering fell over and crushed
him.  The CA/FACE investigator was informed of this incident by the
California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (CAL/OSHA)
Bureau of Investigations (BOI) office on December 5, 1995.  A site
investigation was conducted by the CA/FACE investigator on December
12, 1995.  The contractor was interviewed and photographs of the
incident site were taken.  Two subsequent interviews were conducted
on January 4th and January 11th, 1996 with the victim's employer. 
During the latter of these two interviews the victim's employer and
co-workers (truck drivers) gave a demonstration on how a lumber
drop (rolling loads) was done.  Photographs of this demonstration
were taken by the CA/FACE investigator.</P>

<p align="justify">The employer in this incident was a lumber yard company.  The
company owned 14 retail lumber yards, four wholesale distribution
centers and a custom mill facility.  There were 36 employees who
worked at the same lumber yard as the victim.  The victim had
worked for his employer for approximately six and a half years. 
There were three other truck drivers working for the company at the
time of the incident.  One of these drivers, however, only drove
smaller trucks.  A safety officer was on staff and he devoted
approximately 50&#37;-75&#37; of his time to safety issues.  Monthly safety
meetings were conducted with the truck drivers and load builders. 
New drivers were required to drive with an experienced driver for
two weeks prior to going out on their own.  The truck drivers
received much of their training on the job.  Older more experienced
drivers would instruct them on how to avoid hazards such as rebar
and rocks and how to be generally aware of their surroundings.  A
yard superintendent went with the drivers approximately once a year
and did an evaluation from a checklist detailing each driver's
performance.  Since this incident, documentation has been developed
by the employer which describes how lumber is to be rolled off of
a truck in a proper and safe manner.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<P><b>INVESTIGATION</b></P>

<p align="justify">On the day of the incident, at approximately 2:15 p.m. the
victim delivered a load of lumber to a residential construction
site.  The delivery was being made to a framing contractor who was
constructing a single family home at this location.  The contractor
stated that the victim had delivered six or seven loads to this
location during the time he had been working at the site.  The
truck the victim drove was described by his employer as a
flatbed/rollerbed truck.  The truck had 10 wheels and there were
two rollers on the back of the flatbed.  The load of lumber
consisted of 174 sheets of 4' by 8' by <sup>19</sup>/<sub>32</sub>&quot; plywood.  The two
stacks (87 each) had combined dimensions of 8' by 8' by 53&quot;.  The
stacks of plywood sat side by side on the flatbed.  The long sides
of each stack were parallel to the sides of the truck (see Exhibit
1). The load weighed 10,022 pounds.  The employer stated that the
wholesaler had given the driver a split load of plywood rather than
one stack.  This was done as a safety precaution for the driver. 
The driver had used a chain to secure the load onto the back of the
truck.</P>

<p align="justify">The procedure for unloading the lumber (rolling loads) at the
site involved the truck driver getting out of the truck and laying
out a couple of pieces of wood (stickers).  He lays these stickers
out at the approximate location (see Exhibit 2) where he plans to
drop the load.  The reason for placing the stickers under the
lumber is to enable the driver to remove the chain used to hold the
plywood together.  Before dropping the lumber the driver must also
remove the chain which secures the lumber to the truck.  The driver
then returns to the cab of the truck and attempts to drop the
lumber off of the rollers and onto the stickers.  This procedure
involves backing the truck up and stepping on the brake, and it may
take several attempts before the lumber falls to the ground.  In
most cases the lumber lands flat (horizontal) on the stickers.</P>

<p align="justify">The framing contractor stated that the lumber had fallen off
of the truck and was standing vertically, or on end at
approximately a 60 degree angle (see Exhibit 3).  The victim then
got out of the truck and came over to speak with the contractor. 
They spoke briefly and the victim returned to the lumber.  The
contractor stated that when he last saw the victim, he was crouched
down beside the lumber where he was probably putting stickers on
the ground between the plywood and the rear of the truck.  The
employer and other truck drivers stated that when the stack didn't
fall flat on the stickers, the standard operating procedure (SOP)
at this point was to attach another chain (see Exhibit 4) to the
plywood and to the back of the truck.  The truck was also to be
parked within a couple of feet of the lumber so that in the event
the lumber fell over it would hit the back of the truck rather then
falling to the ground.  After having completed these tasks the
driver would then return to the cab by walking around the outside
of the plywood, avoiding walking between the stack and the truck. 
He would then pull the truck forward which in turn would pull the
plywood onto the stickers in a horizontal position (see Exhibit 5).</p>

<p align="justify">In this incident, the victim had apparently leaned under the
load of plywood to place the stickers.  He had not backed the truck
up to within a couple of feet of the leaning plywood, which was the
SOP, and consequently when the stack of plywood shifted it fell
over on top of him.  The contractor stated that he heard the lumber
crash to the ground and felt the vibration when it hit.  He then
looked around and did not see the victim.  He walked around the
load and saw a portion of the victim protruding from under the
plywood.  He yelled to some of his workers to come over and help. 
Several workers came over to assist the contractor and used a car
jack and two 4&quot;x8&quot; pieces of lumber to remove the victim from under
the plywood.  Emergency services were summoned and the victim was
pronounced dead at 2:56 p.m. by city fire paramedics.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<P><b>CAUSE OF DEATH</b></P>

<p align="justify">The Coroner's Autopsy Report stated the cause of death to be
multiple traumatic injuries.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<P><b>RECOMMENDATIONS/DISCUSSION</b></P>

<p align="justify"><b>Recommendation #1:  Employers should consider equipping their
trucks with forklifts or bed-mounted cranes so that heavy loads of
lumber can be safely unloaded.</b></P>

<p align="justify">Discussion:  In this incident, the truck driver was not able
to control the precise position his load landed when it rolled off
the truck. This forced him to make later adjustments which
ultimately led to his death. If he had a crane or forklift, he
would have been able to unload the lumber with no further
positioning.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Recommendation #2:  Employers should provide formal safety training
for truck drivers and educate them about the potential hazards of
their jobs, in particular those associated with unstable loads.</b></P>

<p align="justify">Discussion:  This incident may have been prevented if the
employer had required that all truck drivers go through a formal
safety training program.  Since this incident, the employer has
documented the procedures for safely rolling a load of lumber. 
This information should also be included in a safety training
program.  Truck drivers should be evaluated by their supervisors
before being allowed to make a drop on their own.  Title 8 of the
California Code of Regulations (CCRs) section 3203(a)(7)(B), 
requires that employers provide employees with information and
training on the procedures to prevent such employees from being
injured during lumber roll-offs by loads which may fall over after
landing in an unstable position (such as leaning on end).  Possible
procedures include positioning the rear of the delivery truck
against upended loads in order to prevent the load from tipping
over while the driver may be working in close proximity (such as
when repositioning stickers under the load).</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Recommendation #3:  Employers should consider purchasing trucks 
that allow a load of lumber to be unloaded at a delivery site in a
controlled manner.</b></P>

<p align="justify">Discussion:  The type of truck used in this incident does not
allow controlled movement of the load from the truck to the ground.
Once the movement is initiated, the driver has no way of
influencing the load's direction or speed. A successful drop, one
in which the load lands in the correct position and orientation,
requires skilled drivers and an optimal operating environment. In
this incident, the driver was unable to control the drop, the load
landed incorrectly, and he was killed during his work to correct
the problem. Truck designs exist that would allow the driver to
drop a load of lumber in the exact position desired with no further
adjustment required. These designs, such as hydraulically operated
tilt-bed trucks, would minimize the effect that drivers' skills
and/or environmental factors have in ensuring a safe unloading.</P>
