This major group includes establishments engaged in cutting timber and
pulpwood; merchant sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock
mills, planing mills, and plywood mills and veneer mills engaged in
producing lumber and wood basic materials; and establishments engaged
in manufacturing finished articles made entirely or mainly of wood or
related materials. Certain types of establishments producing wood products
are classified elsewhere. For example, furniture and office and store
fixtures are classified in major group 25; musical instruments, toys and
playground equipment, and caskets are classified in major group 39.
Woodworking in connection with construction, in the nature of

operations of logging combined with sawmills, pulp mills, or other
converting activity, with the logging not separately reported, are
classified according to the primary product shipped.
