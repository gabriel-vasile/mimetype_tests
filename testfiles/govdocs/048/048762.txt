Dear Chairwoman Steiger:

     I recently heard from several of my constituents at
Centerville Lumber Company, regarding "Made in the USA"
restrictions.

     I have enclosed copies of their letters to me for your
information. In order to ensure that my constituents receive the
most timely response, please respond directly to them and forward
a copy of your reply to my Washington office.

     Thank you for your attention to the concerns of my
constituents.   

               Sincerely,


               Ed Bryant, M.C.

Dear Senator
     Federal Trade Commission regulations require that products
labeled "Made in the USA" "all or virtually all" domestically
produced. These regulations keep jobs in the USA and assure
consumers that if an item says "Made in USA", it means what it
says.
     The FTC is currently investigating whether the current
standard should be modified to allow "Made in the USA" claims for
products that are not all or virtually all made in the USA. If
this happens, many consumers will be deceived.
     In connection with this investigation, the FTC requested
comments from interested parties. Over 100 individuals took the
time to reply to the FTC, often sending handwritten comments. 
The overwhelming majority strongly supported retaining the
current standard.  Many writers expressed their desire to know
that they were purchasing products produced by U.S. workers
instead of underpaid foreign workers.
     Some companies have moved their production to foreign
countries (taking U.S. jobs with them), but perform some
processing and assembly in the U.S. These manufacturers want to
be able to claim that their products are, in fact, "Made in the
USA".  Many of these companies claim the lower standard for USA
claims will create more jobs in the U.S.A., but this is not true:
*    If a company can import foreign components products by cheap
     labor (sometimes in violation of human rights) and be able
     to make a "Made in USA" claim, they will have a cost
     advantage over the domestic producer. Consequently, domestic
     manufacturers (whose "Made in USA" label will no longer mean
     much) will be forced to import component parts to remain
     competitive, costing U.S. jobs.
*    Some companies that now import foreign components, and thus
     have exported U.S. jobs, may qualify for a "Made in USA"
     claim under the lower standard, encouraging more foreign
     sourcing.  Today, any company that uses imported components
     already has the right to make qualified "Made in USA" claims
     revealing the use of foreign components.
     I urge the Congress to stand up for domestic jobs and
domestic industries by aggressively supporting the current "Made
in U.S.A." standard.  As the FTC proceedings continue, and as
Congress considers the issue, I hope that you will join us in
this critical effort.    Sincerely,
                         Centerville Lumber CO.
                         Howard A. Vaughn, Jr.
