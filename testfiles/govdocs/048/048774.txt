  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
      Resources,
      Division of Parks and Recreation, in cooperation with the
      NC Center
      for Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the GIS
      data set,
      State Parks, depicting boundaries of all lands managed by
      the NC
      Division of Parks and Recreation in North Carolina.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies
      and others in making resource management decisions through
      the use
      of a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      system filename: stprk100 approx. file size = 0.5 mb
      Revisions and updates to this layer include:
      This file was previously called nc100.prk
      3.) The NOAA Coastal Services Center obtained the original
      coverage from NCCGIA, clipped it to the boundary of the
      Larger Work (New Hanover County) and reprojected the data
      into NAD83, North Carolina state plane (feet).  The coverage
      was then converted to a shapefile.  (199811)
      2.)filename: stprk795 The July 27, 1995 update consisted of
      the following:
      a.)Incorporated updated boundaries from a digital data
      file received from Parks & Recreation (Sue Regier 733-7795)
      for the following parks (listed by pk-name):
      Bay Trees Medoc Mountain
      Carolina Beach Merchants Mill Pond
      Crowder's Mtn. Raven Rock
      Dismal Swamp Singletary Lk Grp Cmp
      Duke Power South Mountain
      Fort Fisher Stone Mountain
      Goose Creek Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature
      Hanging Rock Preserve*
      Jockey's Ridge William B. Umstead
      b.) *"Weymouth Woods" and "Sandhills Nature Preserve" park
      names were combined, and annotation corrected. (These were
      listed as separate parks, but are actually the same,
      according to Sue Regier.) Also, altered pk-name to 40
      characters so the combined name would fit.
      c.)Annotation corrected for Carolina Beach (incorrectly
      annotated "Fort Fisher")
      d.)Pk-name corrected for Masonboro Island (incorrectly
      labeled "Carolina Beach")
      e.)New park boundaries, labels and annotation added:
      Fort Fisher (south of Carolina Beach) Bald Head Island
      State Natural Area (south of Ft. Fisher) Lumber River
      State Park (along the Lumber River)
      f.) Clipped out lake sections of Jordan, Falls, and
      Kerr boundaries. Sue Regier clarified that the lakes
      themselves are not under State Parks jurisdiction (only
      the park boundaries around the lakes are).
      g.)All stream arcs were labeled pk-type 'SNSR'.
      h.)Added annotation for State Rivers: Horsepasture River,
      Linville River, Lumber River, New River
      (The annotation for New River and Lumber River reads
      "State River & State Park" to clarify that the stream
      sections are State Rivers, and the polygon sections are
      State Parks.)
      i.) Removed annotation that existed in coverage for
      Educational State Forests: Clemmons E.S.F.; Holmes E.S.F.;
      Tuttle E.S.F.; Jordan E.S.F.; Bladen Lakes E.S.F. (These
      areas are managed by Forestry Division, not Parks &
      Recreation.)
      j.)Removed annotation for the NC Zoo (not under State Parks
      jurisdiction).
      k.)Dropped pk-number from NC100.PRK.PAT (nobody knows what
      this number means).
      l.)Recalculated acreage.
      1.)filename: stprk90 Original version dated 1990.

      The New Hanover County Community Vulnerability Assessment
      Tool is an informational aid designed to assist communities
      in their efforts to reduce hazard vulnerability. Before communities
      can develop effective hazard mitigation strategies, they must first
      identify their hazard risks and assess their vulnerability to the
      impacts of those hazards. This CD-ROM product includes a newly developed
      methodology for conducting a community-wide vulnerability assessment.
      The general methodology is included as a tutorial that steps the user
      through a process of analyzing physical, social, economic and environmental
      vulnerability at the community level.

  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    The NC DENR-Division of Parks and Recreation delineated the
    state park boundaries on overlays to USGS 1:100,000-scale
    topographic maps. These were digitized by NC CGIA using
    ESRI's ARC/INFO version 5.0 GIS using a Calcomp digitizer
    and ARCEDIT. The data is now in ArcView version 3.0 shapefile
    format.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The NC DENR-Division of Parks and
      Recreation delineated the state park boundaries on mylar
      overlays to USGS 1:100,000-scale topographic maps.
      Attributes were likewise noted and transferred to the
      digital file. Check plots were run to check the attributes
      against the source data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software,
    the dataset was built for arc and polygon topology using
    the command. The data set was then cleaned with the
    'clean' command Topology has not been edited since the last
    build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent the boundaries of all land managed
    by the NC DENR Division of Parks and Recreation. Arcs are
    coded with State Natural and Scenic River ID's. Polygons
    are coded with state natural areas, state park areas, state
    recreational areas, state natural and scenic rivers, state lakes.

        The State Park boundaries were marked on USGS
        1:100,000-scale topographic maps which meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards, using a best estimate with reference to
        surrounding features. Boundaries drawn were digitized and
        check plots used to ensure correct boundary location within
        a pen-width of the original linework.
