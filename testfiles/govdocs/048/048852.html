				  <h2><a name="toc" id="toc"></a>INDICATOR: Criteria Air Pollutants in Southeast Michigan</h2>
                  <p><strong><a name="background" id="background"></a>Background</strong></p>
                        <p>The federal Clean Air Act requires  EPA to establish National Ambient Air  Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants considered harmful to the public and  the environment. These standards define the <a href="#note">maximum permissible concentration of &quot;criteria pollutants&quot;</a> in the air. Criteria pollutants are those common throughout the United States. They are carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb),  nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter (PM) less than or equal to 10 (PM<sub>10</sub>) or 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) micrometers in diameter, and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Of the six  pollutants, PM and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. In  the Detroit area,  PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone continue to violate the NAAQS.</p>
                        <p>The NAAQS  established for the six criteria pollutants are monitored by the Michigan  Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) through the Michigan Air Sampling  Network (MASN) for compliance. Currently there are eleven MASN stations in Wayne County  for the various criteria pollutants.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Carbon Monoxide</em></strong></p>
                          <p>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and  poisonous gas that is created during the incomplete burning of fuel. In cities,  as much as 95% of all CO emissions come from automobile exhaust. Michigan's on-road motor  vehicle sources account for 69% of the state's CO emissions. Michigan's non-road vehicle sources  contribute 28% of the state's CO emissions. These sources include aircraft,  marine vessels, non-road two and four stroke engines, and railroads. CO  emissions from Michigan's  industries (point sources) account for only 2%. For the Detroit area, fossil fuel combustion from  electric utilities, industrial, commercial and residential sources, as well as iron  and steel manufacturing and foundries, were the leading point sources of CO.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Lead</em></strong></p>
                          <p>In the past, automobile sources were the  major contributor of lead emissions to the atmosphere. Industrial and combustion sources are now  the dominant lead emission sources, especially smelting/refining of lead,  copper and zinc, and the production of iron, steel, brass and bronze. The  highest air concentrations of lead are usually found in the vicinity of  smelters and battery manufacturers. For combustion sources, lead is an impurity  found in coal, oil, and waste oil, as well as municipal solid waste and sewage  sludge incineration.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Nitrogen  Dioxide </em></strong></p>
<p>The major man-made sources that result in the  production of NO<sub>2</sub> are high temperature combustion processes. In Michigan, 46% of NO<sub>2</sub>  producing compounds come from on-road sources, and 31% come from point sources  such as industrial, commercial, institutional and residential fossil fuel  combustion. Nitrogen dioxide can sometimes be seen as a reddish-brown  layer over the city.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Ozone</em></strong></p>
    <p>Depending on its location in the atmosphere,  ozone is considered either good or bad. Good ozone occurs  naturally in the stratosphere approximately 16-48 km (10-30 miles) above the Earth's  surface and forms a layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful rays.  In the Earth's lower atmosphere, ground-level ozone is  considered bad. Ground-level ozone  is created by chemical reactions  in the atmosphere involving other air pollutants in the presence of sunlight.  These reactions usually occur during the hot summer months. </p>
                        <p>Major sources of the pollutants that form  ozone are engine exhaust, emissions from industrial facilities, combustion from  electric utilities, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, and emissions from  natural sources. Ground-level ozone  can be transported hundreds of kilometers.  As a result, the long-range transport of air pollutants impacts the air quality  of areas far downwind. Transported ozone and ozone precursors  from Gary, Indiana,  Chicago, Illinois,  and Milwaukee, Wisconsin,  and other upwind source areas affect the levels of ground-level ozone in Michigan.</p>
                        <p>Of  the sources of ozone producing pollutants in Michigan, 63% are emitted by vehicles, and  the other 37% are emitted from  combustion of fuels, chemical and petroleum manufacturing, and naturally from  vegetation.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Particulate  Matter</em></strong></p>
    <p>Particulate matter is a general term used for  a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some  particles are large enough to be seen as dust or dirt where others are so small  they can only be detected with an electron microscope. The larger PM (PM<sub>10</sub>) are particles less than  10 micrometers [&mu;m] in diameter which is equal to about 1/7th the diameter of a human hair. In Michigan, 34% of PM<sub>10</sub> comes from particles that originate from point sources, such as power  plants, and various manufacturing and industrial processes; 32% comes from  &quot;area&quot; sources, such as wood stoves and fireplaces, agriculture and forestry  practices, oil and gas production, paper manufacturing, and small  airborne particles that do not originate from any specific point; and another 34% comes from vehicle  emissions. Fine PM (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are particles less than 2.5 &mu;m in diameter. PM<sub>2.5</sub> comes from the same sources as PM<sub>10</sub>, but can also  form in the air through chemical reactions with atmospheric pollutants. PM<sub>2.5</sub> from vehicle emissions comprises 50% of the ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Michigan. Area sources make up 37% and point sources  contribute 13%. Particles with diameters of less than 50 &mu;m are classified as  total suspended particulates (TSP), an older measure of PM.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Sulfur  Dioxide</em></strong> </p>
    <p>In Michigan,  85% of the overall  SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are from point sources. These point sources are  from industrial processes that burn fossil fuels, chemical manufacturing,  metals processing, petroleum-related industries, and incineration. Other sources include  residential, commercial, and industrial space-heating.</p>

</div>
                            <p><strong><em>Carbon Monoxide</em></strong></p>
							<p>From 1979 to 1984,  the CO levels in the Detroit  area had exceeded the NAAQS for 8-hour exposure. Since that time, there have  been no exceedances. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> indicates a clear downward trend since 1979 (when U.S. EPA first established criteria for  the National Air Monitoring Sites). This trend represents a 50% decrease  in average CO levels every 10 years, or 0.31 ppm/year. On August 30, 1999,  the Detroit  area was taken off the list of problem areas for carbon monoxide.</p>
                              <p>The decline of CO in the Detroit area follows a national trend, even  though there is an increase in the distance vehicles travel. Starting with the  Clean Air Act of 1970, catalytic converters, fuel economy standards, national  standards for tailpipe emissions, new vehicle technologies, clean fuels  programs, and state and local emissions reduction measures are credited with  the decrease in emissions of CO. </p>
                              <p><strong><em>Lead</em></strong></p>
							  <p>Ambient lead levels have been consistently below  NAAQS since 1981, when the U.S. EPA established new ambient lead monitoring criteria.  The average air quality  concentration for lead in the Detroit  area in 2005 was 98% lower than the high in 1983 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). </p>
                              <p>Due  to the phase-out of leaded gasoline, ambient lead concentrations in air sharply  declined during the 1980s and early 1990s, and in Michigan,  vehicle emissions<strong> </strong>no  longer contribute quantifiable lead emissions. Because of the success of  reduction of lead from auto emissions, in 1999, the U.S. EPA reduced  requirements for measuring lead air pollutant concentrations near major highways,  while focusing on point sources. Point  sources such as nonferrous smelters and battery plants now contribute 100% of Michigan's overall lead  emissions. However, there are no  large sources of lead in Michigan  and the average ambient lead levels are less than one-tenth of the NAAQS.</p>
                              <p><strong><em>Nitrogen Dioxide</em> </strong></p>
                              <p>Michigan has never recorded a  violation of the nitrogen dioxide standard. From 1979 to 2005, the Detroit area has been well below the NAAQS  for NO<sub>2</sub> at an average of 43% (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Regulations on vehicle emissions over the past few decades  and reductions in emissions from power plants due to stricter regulations and  new technologies have contributed to a decreasing trend.</p>
                              <p><strong><em>Ozone</em></strong></p>
							  <p>In  1979, the U.S. EPA established a 1-hour standard for ozone. Since then, there has been a slight downward  trend in the 1-hour ozone level in the Detroit  area (<a href="#fig4a">Figure 4a</a>). From 1979 to 1989, the standard was exceeded five out of the  ten years. From 1990 to 2000, the standard was exceeded only once, and since  1995 there have been no exceedances. </p>
                              <p>In the past, 8-hour ozone measurements were  taken to help estimate the 1-hour standard. In 1997, based on the latest scientific information showing adverse  effects from exposures allowed by the 1-hour standard, the U.S. EPA  strengthened the ozone NAAQS by adopting the 8-hour averaging time.  By 2005, the 1-hour standard was mostly phased-out in favor of the  8-hour standard. </p>
                              <p>There is no clear trend for the Detroit area 8-hour ozone levels (<a href="#fig4b">Figure 4b</a>).  Currently, the Detroit  area is not considered in compliance with the NAAQS. In 2006, MDEQ instituted  measures aimed at meeting the NAAQS by 2007. The most  significant action is a requirement for low-vapor pressure gasoline to be sold  in the Detroit  area during summer months to reduce the amount of ozone-causing air pollutants.</p>
                              <p><strong><em>Particulate Matter</em></strong></p>
							  <p>From 1960 to 1985, the total suspended  particulate (TSP) standard in the Detroit  area was exceeded every year, with no clear trend toward improvement (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).  The standard was revised from TSP to PM<sub>10</sub> in 1987, as research demonstrated smaller sized  particles presented a greater health risk. From 1988 (the first full year of  monitoring under the new PM<sub>10</sub> standard) to 2005, there were no  exceedances, on average, of the NAAQS for PM<sub>10</sub> in the Detroit area. However, the  Dearborn  station did register a few exceedances of the 24-hour PM<sub>10</sub> standard during that time and continues to have the highest maximum  annual average (39.7 &mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>) in the state. In 1997, the PM<sub>10</sub> standard was revised and a new standard was  added for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Since  1999 (the first full year of monitoring under the new PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard), the Detroit  area has met the standard only once (in 2004). Due to failure to meet the PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard, MDEQ is required to develop control strategies to bring the  area into attainment by 2010. </p>
                              <p>Along with the requirement  for MDEQ to reduce the level of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, there are several federal  measures in place that are intended to reduce vehicle emissions nationwide,  which is expected to have an impact for Wayne County. One program is aimed at  reducing the level of sulfur in gasoline and sets standards for tailpipe  emissions. Another addresses emission control technologies for new diesel  engines and reduces the allowable level of sulfur in non-road diesel fuel.  Other measures to reduce air pollutants from power plants are also expected to  have a positive effect on limiting the generation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Controls  being implemented at local steel mills and oil refineries are expected to  result in significant reductions and will help bring the area into attainment  by 2010.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Sulfur Dioxide</em></strong></p>
							  <p>In the Detroit area, SO<sub>2</sub> levels have consistently  been well below the NAAQS since 1979 and show a clear downward trend. The  ambient level of sulfur dioxide has decreased by 73% since 1979 (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).  This reduction was due to new technology at coal-burning power plants, reducing  the average sulfur content of fuels burned, and the increased use of natural  gas for heating homes and businesses.                              </p>

                        <p>Efforts must continue to increase the availability and  implementation of new technologies so that all air quality standards are met.  There must be open dialogue with all parties involved and allow public access  to data on current air conditions to foster an environment of continuous  improvement in emissions reductions. On March 29, 2007, the U.S. EPA defined requirements for  plans submitted by states that did not reach attainment based on their  compliance with PM<sub>2.5</sub> standards implemented in 1997. Nonattainment  states have been required to submit plans by April 2008 outlining measures to  reach attainment by 2010. MDEQ submitted documentation in February 2005 showing  only Wayne County as nonattainment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>.  The U.S. EPA determined that the six counties surrounding Wayne were contributing to its nonattainment  status. Michigan  is required to bring these areas into attainment by 2010. </p>
                        <p>SEMCOG's Southeast Michigan Air Quality Task Force and MDEQ  have developed an attainment strategy for bringing the region into compliance  with the annual standard by 2010. However, the new daily standard poses  additional challenges. Much work still needs to be done to understand the  characteristics of different species of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particularly organic  carbon.</p>
                        <p>In 2005, MDEQ and SEMCOG submitted an ozone attainment  strategy to U.S. EPA, identifying the control measures that would be  implemented to meet the 8-hour ozone standard. While southeast Michigan has not measured  a violation of the standard in the last three years, and MDEQ has requested the  region be redesignated as attainment, the State and SEMCOG have moved forward  with implementation of the control measures in the attainment strategy. These  include a decrease in the allowable vapor pressure of summertime gasoline from  7.8 to 7.0 psi, and a reduction in allowable volatile organic compound  emissions from consumer and commercial products. Both of these measures went  into effect in 2007.</p>
<p><strong><a name="research" id="research"></a>Research/Monitoring Needs </strong></p>
                        <p>Air quality monitoring that will support the development of  effective attainment strategies is critical to meeting standards. More quality  monitoring data are needed to understand the specific sources of the various  pollutants and the most effective ways to control them. Additional research  exploring the specific links between air pollution and respiratory problems is  also needed. In particular, a better understanding is needed of why asthma  rates are increasing at the same time air quality is improving.</p>
                        <p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> is currently monitored according to a  federal reference method which allows comparisons to NAAQS. Hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> is  monitored using a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) instrument.  In order to identify and characterize the components within PM<sub>2.5</sub>  samples, a Met-One Spiral Ambient Speciation Sampler (SASS) is used. Both TEOM  and SASS have been recently implemented throughout the state. There must be a  close coupling of monitoring and characterization (i.e., stack testing and  other analyses to understand where pollutants are coming from) with the  response to meet air quality objectives for all six criteria pollutants. According  to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Group at SEMCOG, there is more need for high-frequency  speciated data collection and analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. More information is  also needed specifically for condensable PM. In addition, research must address  how quickly and under what conditions secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> forms in the  region. Measures need to be undertaken to properly identify the sources of  organic carbon in certain areas. Ozone research must address the specific types  of volatile organic compounds in the air so that effective strategies for  attainment can be implemented. Increased air quality regulations are being  implemented in the midst of federal funding cutbacks for monitoring. However,  reduced monitoring decreases the ability to develop effective attainment  strategies. Every effort must be made to ensure adequate monitoring to be able  to achieve effective management.</p>
