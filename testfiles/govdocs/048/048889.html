        Hello and welcome to today's Female Frontiers forum with Jean Bartik. 
        Jean is one of many women who are pioneers in the computer industry. She 
        is one of the first women to program the ENIAC, which was the first computer 
        developed in the United States. She has also worked on the BINAC and UNIVAC 
        computers, which were successors to the ENIAC. Currently, she sells real 
        estate and plays bridge in her spare time.

        most? When did you become interested in the field? If you could go back 
        would you still want to do this?</font><br>
        My family. I believed I could do anything. Plus, a woman math teacher, 
        said go to the U of Pa because they had a differential analyzer. No, there 
        was a war on and women were doing everything, including Rosie the riviter.

        I took math and physics, but I also liked to write so I had a math majopr 
        and an English minor. I was also a good athelete and the phys. ed. department 
        tried to recruit me as a phys. ed. major.

        you couldn't do it because you were a woman? If so, how did you reply?</font><br>
        No. My grandmother and my Aunt Gretchen were my role models. My gtrandmother 
        stopped a jail break while my grandfather who was the county sheriff was 
        away. She held them with a gun until help arrived. My aunt Gretchen got 
        out of Missouri and , to me, led a glamorous life. Didn't get married 
        until 40, had no children and taught at a number of different places. 
        She treated her nieces and nephews as her children. Of course, I got married 
        at 22 and had 3 children.

        tell you, you couldn't be what you are? What courses did you take in college 
        to become this?</font><br>
        Actually, I wanted adventure and to see something other than Missouri. 
        I always knew I would not settle down in Missouri and become the local 
        math teacher. No. I never met Sally Ride. She is a lot younger than I. 
        I loved the work and thought I had died and gone to heaven.

        Yes, I have many hobbies: movies, plays, hen parties or even not hen parties,horse 
        racing, football pools, lotteries, watching tennis (going to US open) 
        and golf, any game of chance except those at Las Vegas and Atlantic City, 
        reading (I read 2 or more books a week), game shows on TV, David Letterrman 
        (been to his show a number of times). My 3 children and their spouses, 
        my 5 grandchildren, and 19 neices and nephews are very important to me 
        although I don't consider them hobbies,

        It never bothered me too much until about 1975 when a Pioneer's conference 
        was scheduled and I discovered that technicians were being asked to speak 
        about ENIAC. I wrote a letter to Dr. Brainard at Penn saying I thought 
        it was terrible that no women were asked to make a presentation. Two different 
        chairmen asked me to speak. Actually I spoke on all of those who had contributed 
        and since died. I didn't go into the women issue. My speech brought down 
        the house. not because of the tribute to them, but because I brought in 
        the human side reather than the technical of soldering this to that. For 
        a while there, one of us would be asked to speak.

        were such a good athlete, why did you choose math over Physical Education?</font><br>
        Never even considered it. My family was made up of farmers and school 
        teachers, and we always considered the use of the mind more important 
        than the physical body. I considered being a journalism major, but I couldn't 
        afford to go to journalism school at the U of Mo. I always liked math 
        but considered it a game rather than a serious subject.

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b><b>mrsmcd/simoneandchase</b></b>] Were the 
        older "key punch" style computers harder to use than the ones now ?</font><br>
        The ENIAC was a [challenging machine] to program. It was a parallel machine 
        where we had to essentially build a centra processor using program trays, 
        digit trays, accumulators, muliplier, divider/square rooter, function 
        tables, master programmer and I/O devices. We were the only group who 
        programmed the ENIAC this way. I had a group at the U of P who worked 
        with Dick Clippinger at Aberdeen and with Johnny von Newmann at Princeton 
        Institute of Advanced Study to turn it into a stored computer program. 
        We used the 3 function tables to store the program and the master programmer 
        to decode instructions and store in the function tables. We used the central 
        accumulator design, which is used by most modern computers. Once it was 
        converted, it was as easy to program as modern computers without a higher 
        level language. Of course, the higher level languages make computers easier 
        to program.

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b><b>sam</b></b>] was computer programming easier 
        today when you began at nasa</font><br>
        I never worked for NASA. I should imagine that it is more difficult today. 
        We didn't worry about fool-proofing our programs. We assumed the user 
        was knowledgeable. Today novices use computers and the programmers must 
        worry about all the idiotic things a user can do. Very hard to predict 
        how silly users can be.

        finding out what interested you from the very beginning..</font><br>
        I wanted to get out of Missouri and see some of the world. I had the confidence 
        that if I started on an even basis I could keep up with anyone in the 
        world; a mistaken and arrogant view. I wanted adventure, something new. 
        I was 21 years old when I came to Philadelphia against the advice of everyone 
        except one math teacher who said, "Come to the U of Pa," because it had 
        a differential analyzer. She had worked at Wright Patterson Air Base in 
        Dayton, Ohio. It also had a differential analyzer, 1 of 4 in the USA. 
        I basically ignored all advice because I wanted a bigger world than Stanberry, 
        Mo.

        to be one of the first women in computers?</font><br>
        I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I had never been around so many 
        brilliant people in my life. My brain was running in high gear. I was 
        in a world I had never dreamed of, yet I knew it was something I'd always 
        wanted. We had no manuals for ENIAC. We learned how to program by studying 
        the logical block diagrams. What a blessing. From the beginning I knew 
        how computers worked. We gained the respect of the engineers from the 
        beginning because we really knew what we were doing and we could debug 
        better than they could because we had our test programs as well as our 
        knowledge of the computer. It also laid down the background so I could 
        do logical design on UNIVAC later on.

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b><b>mrsmcd/traicemark</b></b>] What was your 
        favorite job in computers?</font><br>
        My favorite job was working on the design team for UNIVAC I. I did some 
        programming, but mainly I did logical design, putting in the check circuits 
        and designing a backup for UNIVAC using cathode ray tube memory. It was 
        microcoded. Art Gehring was my partner in doing logical design for UNIVAC 
        I. Pres Eckert wanted a backup machine in the event the mercury delay 
        line memory didn't work. The mercury delay line memory did work so the 
        backup was never built and electrstatic storage was abandoned early on 
        for core memory. I worked directly with Pres for about a year. Some have 
        called Pres the greatest engineer of the 20th century. If not that, he 
        was one of the most exciting people for whom I ever worked. My mind had 
        to work at an intellectual gallop all the time, and I never felt so alive 
        in my life. I couldn't wait to get to work and we (the UNIVAC group) worked 
        through all breaks and lunch. We knew we were pushing back frontiers. 
        It was a very cohesive group. No question was too small for Pres to answer, 
        but I never pretended to know or understand something I didn't. Pres would 
        remember it, even a year later. Pres was the first person I ever met who 
        dealt easily with negative information. At first, I was afraid to tell 
        him one of his ideas wasn't working out. Then, I discovered he treated 
        bad news just like any other bit of information. He didn't need to think 
        about that anymore. He just took off on another way to do it. I was out 
        of the computer business from 1951 to 1967. When I came back many of the 
        ideas I had discussed with him were just being implemented. He understood 
        early on that file processing was the key to commercial processing and 
        I do believe we [did it] almost every way to do it in the late 40s. John 
        Mauchly was one of the most lovable and personable of people, but he constantly 
        pushed me to think beyond the present task and toward the future. I believe 
        he was truly one of the first people to think of a higher level language. 
        In fact, he hired Grace Hopper to work on his ideas for an Assembler language 
        for UNIVAC. This was her first introduction to computer languages.

        It is a lot of fun to find somebody a house they really like and a good

        a house that isn't a good real estate investment, especially young people. 
        I've had both but I've come to realize that people's emotional reasons

        No, I would never want to work for the army today. In 1945, we were still 
        in WW II, and we had gone through a terrible war. All of us had friends 
        and relatives in the war, and most of us had lost loved ones in the war. 
        Our main goal was to end the war. I would have done almost anything for 
        the war effort. I am glad others can tolerate thinking about another war, 
        but not me. I want peace and will spend my efforts to creating peace.

        favorite job in the army? </font><br>
        I was never in the army. I worked for Army Ordinance at Aberdeen Proving 
        Grounds, but our group was located at the University of Pennsylvania in 
        Philadelphia. My most exciting job was programming the trajectory problem 
        for the demonstration on February 15, 1946. Herman Goldstine, our liason 
        with Aberdeen, asked Betty Snyder (Holberton) and me if we could have 
        the trajectory problem ready on time. He asked us about 2 weeks before 
        the demonstration. We said."Sure." We were sure because we believed our 
        program was perfect. Ah, the confidence of youth. We worked like dogs 
        to get it on the machine and debugged. Dean Pender came down one day and 
        asked us how we were doing. We said. "Fine." He said. "Hop to it." and 
        gave us a bottle of liquor. I didn't even drink, but I knew how important 
        the success of this demonstration was to him. Betty had a fantastically 
        logical mind. I have said that she did more logic in her sleep than most 
        people do when they are fully awake. I have had 3 great work partners 
        in my life and Betty is one of them. We couldn't get the problem to go 
        and it was 2 AM on the day of the demonstration. Betty came in the morning 
        and changed one switch on the master programmer and the program ran. She 
        awoke with the answer to our problem. The trajectory ran faster than it 
        took the missle to trace the trajectory. We printed out the trajectory 
        and gave copies to the attendees. It was fabulous. Everyone couldn't believe 
        their eyes. They turned off the lights in the computer room and the attendees 
        could see the accumulators computing the numbers (the tips of the tubes 
        were visible through holes in the front panels of the ENIAC. It set the 
        standard for years to come when a computer was working. Hollywood used 
        the front panels of thje ENIAC as the model.

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b><b>Elise</b></b>] Who built the ENIAC? How 
        old were you when you started programming the ENIAC? Have you ever been 
        to space? If yes, what is it like. If no, did you ever want to? Have you 
        ever met Martin Luther King? How did the Eniac work? Who came up with 
        the plans? Did it have a mouse? Did it know Kid Pix? How many children 
        do you have? How long did it take to program?</font><br>
        The ENIAC was built by the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the 
        University of Pennsylvania. I was 21 years old when I became an ENIAC 
        programmer. The ENIAC was built to compute firing tables for Army Ordinance 
        during WW II. For each new gun, tables are calculated to show the soldiers 
        how to aim the gun to reach its target. It took a person at a desk calculator 
        about 40 hours to compute one trajectory for one gun. A table consisted 
        of hundreds of trajectories for different gun elevations, different altitudes, 
        and different weather conditions. John Mauchly, a physicist at Penn and 
        very interested in weather prediction, took an electronics course at Penn. 
        The lab was run by a genius engineer named Pres Eckert who was 22 or 23 
        years old. John began talking to Pres about his idea of building an electronic 
        computer. Electronics was in its infancy. Pres told John he believed an 
        electronic computer could be built to do it if one were careful. WW II 
        was in progress, this was 1943, and John wrote a proposal for an electronic 
        computer to do firing tables. In the meantime, a young major in the army 
        who was also a PhD mathematician named Herman Goldstine had been sent 
        to Penn to try to speed up the computing of trajectories by a group of 
        about 80 "computers", people using desk calculators doing trajectories. 
        They were truly called "computers" and I was hired as a computer in 1945. 
        Herman saw John's proposal and went off to Aberdeen to tell them of the 
        proposal. John and Pres explained how they would build such a machine. 
        The great economist Veblen was at the meeting,and he pronounced, "Give 
        them the money." And so Army Ordinance did. At this time, Pres was 23 
        years old and all engineers to a man said no one could make 15,000 (it 
        ended up 18,000) vacuum tubes could work reliably enough to get any worthwhile 
        calculations out of it. Pres had said one had to be "careful" and so he 
        was. He designed the accumulators, the main calculating engines of the 
        machine, out of flip flops, which were in one state or the other, on or 
        off. Signals only had to be strong enough to trigger the flip flop. Thus, 
        vacuum tubes didn't have to work very well to perform reliabily for ENIAC 
        purposes. Plus, the accumulators were built using decade counter modules. 
        Each decade counter could store a number 0 to 9. An accumulator was made 
        up of 10 decade counters plus a sign, thus could store a signed 10-digit 
        number. When a tube failed, the maintenance engineer had to remove only 
        the decade counter in which it was located and another decade counter 
        would be inserted. All repairs were done off line. A number of very wonderful 
        engineers worked on the ENIAC and went off to spread their computer knowledge 
        to new and other companies. Bob Shaw did the function tables, Chuan Chu 
        did the Divider/Square Rooter, Kite Sharpless was the Master Programmer, 
        Arthur Berks did the Multiplier, Harry Husky did the Punch Card Reader 
        and Punch. Jack Davis designed the Accumulator. Pres was the Chief Engineer 
        and John was the overall logical designer. The professors at the Moore 
        School (the engineering school at Penn where ENIAC was designed and built) 
        didn't much want to be associated with it because they thought it wouldn't 
        work. Of course it did work. It ran for over 10 years and ran over 100 
        different problems. Most of which had never been calculated before. No, 
        it didn't have a mouse, but we did run it from a remote control. We could 
        start and stop it and slow it down to one add time for each click on the 
        remote control. No, I've never been in space. If I were younger, I might 
        like to go, but not now. I'll leave that to you. No, I never had the honor 
        of meeting Dr. King. The ENIAC was not user friendly. Only trained people 
        could use it; mainly scientists. I have 3 children: Tim is an economist 
        with the Upjohn Institute, a think tank studying employment policies, 
        Jane is a programmer doing modelling of IBM's large systems for performance 
        evaluation, and Mary is a CPA who likes to do management systems for companies. 
        I have 5 grandchildren: Christopher, Alex, Jonathan, Jamie and Jesse. 
        Most of them like math and many sports.

        I went to a 1-room schoolhouse, where grades 1 to 8 were in the same room. 
        We had one bookcase as our library. After my school work was done, I would 
        sit and listen to other classes recite, so I learned about the things 
        other classes were studying. I did a lot of reading, so I knew there was 
        a big world out there beyond my little place in Missouri. I had an Aunt 
        Gretchen who taught school in Cleveland. She came home every summer, and 
        I wanted to be like Aunt Gretchen. I dreamed about going to New York, 
        Chicago, Los Angeles or Washington, D.C. We had no TV and no radio until 
        I was about 12. I can remember we walked down to my uncle's house to listen 
        to the Joe Louis/Max Schmeling fight. We had a pony named Beauty and a 
        riding horse. Also, I was a good softball pitcher. Every summer we played 
        softball and travelled around to other towns to play other teams. I had 
        3 brothers and 3 sisters, and I was next to the youngest. I had to work 
        hard to be noticed in my family. I milked cows before I was 5 years old, 
        and worked in the field plowing corn and raking hay. I loved threshing 
        time because the neighbors came to help and it was almost like a party. 
        After Christmas, the greatest holiday of the year was the 4th of July. 
        The carnival came to town with all the rides: ferris wheel, glider, the 
        whip, the merry-go-round, and others. Also, radio performers from KMBC 
        in Kansas City came to perform on a big outdoor stage. It was such fun 
        and we would come home late but exhausted after our big day. At one time, 
        I wanted to be a nurse, then a writer, then a math major, but always I 
        wanted to go out and see the world. I was a day dreamer and went out in 
        the field and looked up at the sky and dreamed what it would be like out 
        there.
