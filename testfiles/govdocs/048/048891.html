A second early electronic machine was Colossus, designed by Alan 
Turing for the British military in 1943. This machine played an 
important role in breaking codes used by the German army in 
World War II. Turing's main contribution to the field of computer 
science 
was the idea of the Turing machine, a mathematical 
formalism widely used in the study of computable functions. 
The existence of Colossus was kept secret until long after 
the war ended, and the credit due to Turing and his colleagues 
for designing one of the first working electronic computers 
was slow in coming.

The first general purpose programmable electronic computer 
was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer 
(ENIAC), 
built by J. Presper Eckert and John V. Mauchly at the 
University of Pennsylvania. Work began in 1943, funded by the 
Army 
Ordnance Department, which needed a way to compute 
ballistics during World War II. 
The machine wasn't completed until 1945, but then it was 
used extensively for calculations during the design of the 
hydrogen bomb. By the time it was decommissioned in 1955 it 
had been used 
for research on the design of wind tunnels, random number 
generators, and weather prediction.
Eckert, Mauchly, and John von Neumann, a consultant to the 
ENIAC project, began work on a new machine before ENIAC was 
finished. 
The main contribution of EDVAC, their new project, was the 
notion of a <em> stored program</em>. There is some controversy 
over 
who deserves the credit for this idea, but none over how 
important the idea was to the 
future of general purpose computers. ENIAC was controlled by a 
set of external switches and dials; to change the program 
required physically altering the settings on these controls. 
These controls also limited the speed of the internal electronic 
operations. Through the use of a memory that was large enough 
to hold both instructions and data, and using the program stored 
in memory to control the order of arithmetic operations, EDVAC 
was able to run orders of magnitude faster than ENIAC. By 
storing instructions in the same medium as data, designers 
could concentrate on improving the internal structure of the 
machine without worrying about matching it to the speed of an 
external control.
