<I>Computer Development at the National Bureau of Standards 
</I><p>
The first fully operational stored-program electronic 
computer in the United States was built at the National 
Bureau of Standards. The Standards Electronic 
Automatic Computer (SEAC) [1] (Fig. 1.) began useful 
computation in May 1950. The stored program was held 
in the machine's internal memory where the machine 
itself could modify it for successive stages of a compu-tation. 
This made a dramatic increase in the power of 
programming. <p>
Although originally intended as an "interim" com-puter, 
SEAC had a productive life of 14 years, with a 
profound effect on all U. S. Government computing, the 
extension of the use of computers into previously 
unknown applications, and the further development of 
computing machines in industry and academia. 
In earlier developments, the possibility of doing 
electronic computation had been demonstrated by 
Atanasoff at Iowa State University in 1937. The ENIAC 
was completed in 1946 at the Moore School of the 
University of Pennsylvania, but programming in that 
machine consisted of setting appropriate switches and 
plug connections. The ENIAC had demonstrated that 
individual computations could be performed at elec-tronic 
speed, but the instructions (the program) that 
drove these computations could not be modified and 
sequenced at the same electronic speed as the computa-tions. 
Other early computers in academia, government, 
and industry, such as Edvac, Ordvac, Illiac I, the Von 
Neumann IAS computer, and the IBM 701, would not 
begin productive operation until 1952. <p>
In 1947, the U. S. Bureau of the Census, in coopera-tion 
with the Departments of the Army and Air Force, 
decided to contract with Eckert and Mauchly, who had 
developed the ENIAC, to create a computer that 
would have an internally stored program which 
could be run at electronic speeds. Because of a demon-strated 
competence in designing electronic components, 
the National Bureau of Standards was asked to be 
technical monitor of the contract that was issued, 
to the company that became the Remington Rand 
Corporation, for the development of the first commer-cial 
computer, the Univac. Actually, there were three 
machines, two for the military and one for the Census 
Bureau. <p>
It became clear during 1948 that unexpected techni-cal 
difficulties would delay completion of the Univacs. 
The machine for the Office of the Air Comptroller was 
primarily for use by George Dantzig, noted for his work 
on Linear Programming applied to economic problems. 
He urged the Air Force to contract with NBS for the 
development of an interim machine which would serve 
multiple purposes. Furthermore, the Bureau was in need 
of a computer for its own scientific research. Conse-quently, 
NBS began development, in its own labora-tory, 
of an interim machine for use by NBS, the Army 
and Air Force, and the Census Bureau, which wished to 
test automatic methods on the 1950 Census. The interim 
machine at NBS was completed and put into continuous 
operation in May 1950, a year before the first commer-cial 
machine was delivered. It was originally called the 
Standards Eastern Automatic Computer to distinguish it 
from the Standards Western Automatic Computer still 
under development at the NBS Institute for Numerical 
Analysis in Los Angeles. <p>
In the early years of its use, SEAC was operated 
24 hours per day, 7 days per week. During this time four 
different kinds of demand were made on the machine. 
It was used by mathematicians from NBS and many 
other institutions to do the calculations that spurred the 
advance of numerical analysis. It was also used by the 
engineering staff of the Electronic Computers Labora-tory 
to develop new components and to expand the 
capabilities of SEAC. A maintenance staff kept 
constant watch on the 12,000 diodes and over 1000 
vacuum tubes by doing diagnostic testing. Finally, with 
the support of other agencies, NBS developed entirely 
new uses for computers and tested these uses on SEAC. 
Despite these competing demands, SEAC achieved 
reliable operation 77 % of the time during its critical 
first three years of operation. This was both a surprise 
and a source of encouragement to the young field of 
computer development. <p>
The mathematical applications of SEAC were well 
represented by the publication of the NBS <I>Handbook 
of Mathematical Functions </I>[2] (which is separately 
described in this volume). One major calculation 
carried out dealt with nuclear energy. The early engi-neering 
and maintenance developments are described in 
an NBS Circular published in 1955: <I>Computer Develop-ment 
(SEAC and DYSEAC) at the National Bureau of 
Standards </I>[1]. It consists of an introduction by S. N. 
Alexander, the Chief of the Electronic Computer 
Laboratory which developed SEAC, and reprints of 
eight papers by NBS staff which were previously 
published in various journals and computer conference 
proceedings. Their titles give an idea of the scope of 
NBS contributions to computer design.

The Greenwald, Alexander, and Haueter paper 
describes the organization of SEAC from the block 
diagram level down to the circuitry level. It exhibits 
pictures of the tens of thousands of hand-constructed 
components which today are manufactured by auto-matic 
methods. To us today, it seems even more amazing 
than it did in 1950 that the thing could work at all! <p>
This circuitry using diodes, vacuum tubes, and pulse 
transformers is described in the Elbourn and Witt paper. <p>
The memory of SEAC initially consisted of what we 
would today describe as 3072 bytes, (not kilobytes or 
megabytes!). This memory, in the form of acoustic 
pulses in mercury columns, is described in the paper by 
Slutz, Holt, Witt, and Friedman, as are subsequent 
developments of a higher speed electrostatic memory 
and a memory design using individual components for 
each bit. <p>
Because of the very limited memory capacity of 
SEAC, it was important to be able to store information 
on external media. These media were also used for 
feeding data and programs to SEAC. The paper by Pike 
and Ainsworth describes the various magnetic and 
paper tape media which served this purpose. One 
magnetic device was an adapted office dictating 
machine, modified to store digital information. 
Each programmer had one of these wire cartridges on 
which the whole history of his or her programming 
experience would be stored. These wire cartridges still 
exist today, but there are no devices to read them, 
thereby losing to history much of the detailed early 
experience on the first computer! <p>
The two papers by Wright, Shupe, and Cooper and 
by Shupe and Kirsch describe how SEAC was main-tained 
in productive operation despite the fact that 
failure in any one of the tens of thousands of compo-nents 
or solder connections would render the computer 
inoperative, or so it was believed. Actually, after 
about ten years of ostensibly fault-free operation, it was 
discovered by Kirsch that there had been a wiring error 
in SEAC from the beginning of its useful life. A 
program written in a certain way would have failed, but 
the conditions for this failure had never occurred in the 
many years of normal operation. Computers of today 
are not as reliable as SEAC aspired to be, so we use 
"workarounds" to live with errors. <p>
Two important lessons learned from the design of 
SEAC were incorporated in the design of DYSEAC in 
1953. The reliability of SEAC's components led to the 
use of similar components in DYSEAC, and new kinds 
of logical organization were also incorporated. These 
are described in the two papers by Leiner, Alexander, 
and Witt and by Leiner, Notz, Smith, and Weinberger. <p>
DYSEAC was built in movable trailers for the U. S. 
Army and is believed to be the first computer to use 
printed circuits. In the short time after its construction 
at NBS, before it was removed by the sponsoring 
organization, it was possible to demonstrate some of 
its important properties. It had extensive abilities for 
real-time interaction with outside devices. One of these 
was SEAC itself, which was able to interrupt computa-tions 
on DYSEAC and send data into files on DYSEAC 
without disruption of the DYSEAC computation. This 
was an early example of hardware-based time-sharing. 
Other examples that ultimately led to industrial process 
control were first demonstrated on the DYSEAC. <p>
The last of the four kinds of uses of SEAC was the 
development of entirely new applications for computers. 
The first uses of SEAC (and indeed most computers) 
were for mathematical calculations. Soon thereafter it 
was recognized that computers, as symbol manipulators, 
could also process alphabetical information. This led to 
so-called business data processing. But the ready 
availability of SEAC for innovation without the need for 
commercial motivation encouraged its use beyond these 
two conventional areas. Two examples of the many 
such innovative areas started on SEAC were Image 
Processing and Chemical Structure Searching. <p>
In 1957 the first picture was fed into a computer 
when a rotating drum scanner was connected to SEAC 
[3]. This project demonstrated that it was possible to 
perform image processing operations on scanned 
pictures, using the (for that time) great processing speed 
of the computer. Progress in scanning technology can be 
seen in the difference between one of the first scans and 
a modern one (Fig. 2). Among the many disciplines 
impacted at NBS by this new field of image processing 
were metallurgy [4], character recognition [5], and 
criminology [6]. Today, this technology, first started on 
SEAC, allows us to do CAT scans in medicine, receive 
satellite images from space, scan bar codes in grocery 
stores, and do desktop publishing [7]. <p>
Experience with non-numerical processing tech-niques 
led to the realization that different kinds of data 
structures could be manipulated with SEAC. One of 
these was the structural diagram used in organic chem-istry. 
In the process of examining new patent applica-tions, 
the U. S. Patent Office needed to search files of 
chemical compounds. Previously, chemical names had 
been the only means of representing compounds, but 
this type of search was not very satisfactory owing to 
inconsistent nomenclature. It was shown [8,9] with the 
use of SEAC that structural diagrams could be repre-sented 
in digital form and searched on the computer, 
thereby finding records that could not have been found 
using nomenclature alone. Chemical structure searching 
is now a multimillion dollar industry which plays a 
major role, for example, in design of new drugs. 
The rapidity with which SEAC and its descendants 
influenced a wide variety of scientific, commercial, 
and even intellectual disciplines encouraged the early 
pioneers to believe that "Nothing will be restrained 
from them which they have imagined to do" [10]. Many 
people still believe that today. <p>
