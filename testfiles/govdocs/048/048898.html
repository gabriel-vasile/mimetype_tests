Subject:     RAM in old computers versus new.
How much RAM did the early computers -- ENIAC, ENIGMA, UNIVAC -- generally
have?  What about speed?  How many megahertz did they run at?  I would like
to know how they compare to a Macintosh LC II with 4 mbs of RAM and operat-
ing at 16 mhz.

Well, I know for one thing their clock speeds were measured in Kilo-hertz,
not Megahertz.  I think ENIAC ran at something like 100 kHz.  And RAM was in
kilobytes (actually they did not really have RAM - I do not really know what
their memory configurations were, but space was definitely limited).
How do they line up against a Mac LC II?  Your Mac would blow them away.
