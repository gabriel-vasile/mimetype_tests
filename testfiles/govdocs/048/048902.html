        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The
        Industrial Revolution was powered by the steam engine,
        invented in 1712,<sup>1</sup> and electricity, first
        harnessed in 1831.<sup>2</sup> Harnessing the power of
        steam meant less labor was needed for manual work; it
        also meant that factories could locate anywhere, not just
        in geographical areas with strong wind and water
        resources. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because
        it required a network to contain and transmit its power,
        electricity's potential had to wait until 50 years after
        it was first harnessed before the first power station was
        built in 1882.<sup>3</sup> It took another 50 years
        before electricity powered 80 percent of factories and
        households across the country </font><a href="fig1.htm" tppabs="http://www.ecommerce.gov/fig1.htm"><font

        </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Early
        uses of electricity were limited. While factories used
        generators for lighting, their primary power still came
        from line shafts and belt drives up to 1907. It was not
        until factories replaced the old power system for
        electric motors that fundamental changes in production
        occurred. Factory structures were streamlined, and key
        processes, such as materials handling and manufacturing
        flows, were made more efficient.<sup>5</sup> </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The
        digital revolution is happening much more quickly. The
        harnessing of light for nearly instantaneous
        communications and the ability to use microscopic
        circuits to process and store huge amounts of information
        are enabling this current economic transformation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In
        1946, the world's first programmable computer, the
        Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC),
        stood 10 feet tall, stretched 150 feet wide, cost
        millions of dollars, and could execute up to 5,000
        operations per second. Twenty-five years later, in 1971,
        Intel packed 12 times ENIAC's processing power into a 12
        mm<sup>2</sup> chip with a $200 price tag.<sup>6</sup>
        Today's personal computers (PCs) with Pentium processors
        perform in excess of 400 million instructions per second
        (MIPS). At the current pace of development, by 2012, PCs
        will be able to handle 100,000 million instructions per
        second.<sup>7</sup> </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As
        late as 1980, phone conversations only traveled over
        copper wires which carried less than one page of
        information per second. Today, a strand of optical fiber
        as thin as a human hair can transmit in a single second
        the equivalent of over 90,000 volumes of an encyclopedia.<sup>8</sup>
        By 2002, a constellation of several hundred satellites
        orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth is expected to
        bring high-bandwidth<sup>9</sup> communications to
        businesses, schools and individuals everywhere on the
        planet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A
        global digital network using new packet switching
        technology<sup>10</sup> combines the power of these
        remarkable innovations in computing and communication.
        The Internet ties together the computing power on desks,
        in factories and in offices around the world through a
        high-speed communications infrastructure. More than 100
        million people around the world, most of whom had never
        heard of the Internet four years ago, now use it to do
        research, send e-mail to friends, make requests for bids
        to suppliers, and shop for cars or books. </font></p>

        </b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One
        of the most notable economic developments in recent years
        has been the rapid increase in the IT sector's (computing
        and communications) share of investment activity and of
        the gross domestic product (GDP). It grew from 4.9
        percent of the economy in 1985 to 6.1 percent by 1990 as
        the PC began to penetrate homes and offices. The next
        spurt started in 1993, with the burst of commercial
        activity driven by the Internet. From 1993 to 1998, the
        IT share of the economy will have risen from 6.4 percent
        to an estimated 8.2 percent </font><a href="fig2.htm" tppabs="http://www.ecommerce.gov/fig2.htm"><font

        at close to 15 percent.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What
        makes this rise in IT's nominal share of the economy even
        more remarkable is the fact that IT prices, adjusted for
        quality and performance improvements, have been falling
        while prices in the rest of the economy have been rising.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Computing
        power has been doubling every 18 months for the past 30
        years. At the same time, the average price of a
        transistor has fallen by six orders of magnitude, due to
        microprocessor development. In just six years' time, the
        cost of microprocessor computing power has decreased from
        $230 to $3.42 per MIPS</font><font color="#3300FF"

        in real terms, the expansion of the IT sector accounts
        for an even larger share of overall economic growth in

        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Companies
        throughout the economy are betting on IT to boost
        productivity and efficiency. In the 1960s, business
        spending on IT equipment represented only 3 percent of
        total business equipment investment. In 1996, IT's share
        rose to 45 percent </font><a href="fig6.htm" tppabs="http://www.ecommerce.gov/fig6.htm"><font

        technology supports high-paying jobs. In 1996, 7.4
        million people worked in IT industries and in IT-related

        $46,000 per year, compared to an average of $28,000 for
        the private sector. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The
        impact of IT is also reflected in the capital IT firms
        currently represent. The collective market

        Intel, Compaq, Dell and Cisco, has grown to over $588

        bandwidth. Bandwidth requirements have increased as
        people began to send images, sound, software, video and
        voice over the Internet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><sup>10</sup>.In
        a packet-switched system, a message is broken into chunks
        and each chunk or &quot;packet&quot; is individually
        addressed and individually routed across the network to
        its destination. At the destination, the message is
        reassembled. Packets that do not arrive at the
        destination are retransmitted. As Vint Cerf, one of the
        inventors of the Internet, describes it: Packet switching
        is conceptually similar to the way the postal service
        works. That is, each letter or postcard is individually
        addressed and moves geographically from point-to-point as
        it travels towards its destination. Two postcards mailed
        from a post office in San Francisco may take different
        routes to New York, but once they arrive at the New York
        City post office, they are assembled with the other mail
        going to the destination address and delivered. Each
        &quot;packet&quot; is like a postcard and network routers
        are like the mail stops along the way. </font></p>

        cable technology was developed in the late 1940's, its
        initial use was primarily for the improvement of
        reception in remote areas. It was not until HBO began to
        distribute its pay-TV movie service via satellite in 1976
        that the medium became a distinct content and advertising
        alternative to broadcast television.&quot; </font></p>

        In 1989, the World Wide Web (WWW) protocols for
        transferring hypertext via the Internet were first used
        in experimental form at the European Center for Particle
        Research (CERN) in Switzerland. In 1991, the National
        Science Foundation lifted the restrictions on the
        commercial use of the Internet. That same year, the World
        Wide Web (WWW) was released by CERN. In 1993, the alpha
        version of Mosaic, the graphical user interface to the
        WWW, was released, giving non-technical users the ability
        to navigate the Internet. This report uses 1993 as the
        date when the Internet became truly open to the public.

        exact figures exist on Internet usage worldwide, but
        different sources point to 1997 as the year when Internet
        usage approaches/crosses the 50 million mark. For
        instance, NUA, an Internet consultancy and developer,
        compiles figures from different research analysts and
        finds the following ranges of Internet usage: 1995: 8-30
        million, 1996: 28-40 million, 1997: &gt;100 million.
