	                    <p>Vilhelm  Bjerknes was a professor of applied mechanics and mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm, where his research revealed  the fundamental interaction 
						between fluid dynamics and thermodynamics.</p>

					  <p>The roots of numerical weather prediction can be traced back  to the work of Vilhelm Bjerknes, a Norwegian physicist who has been called the  father of modern 
					  meteorology.&nbsp; In 1904,  he published a paper suggesting that it would be possible to forecast the  weather by solving a system of nonlinear partial differential 
					  equations.&nbsp; </p>
					  
					  <p>A British mathematician named Lewis Fry Richardson spent  three years developing Bjerknes&rsquo;s techniques and procedures to solve these  equations.&nbsp; Armed with 
					  no more than a  slide rule and a table of logarithms, and working among the World War I  battlefields of France where he was a member of an ambulance unit, Richardson  
					  computed a prediction for the change in pressure at a single point over a six-hour  period.&nbsp; The calculation took him six  weeks, and the prediction turned out to be 
					  completely unrealistic, but his  efforts were a glimpse into the future of weather forecasting.&nbsp; </p>

					  <p>Richardson foresaw a &ldquo;forecast factory,&rdquo; where he calculated that  64,000 human &ldquo;computers,&rdquo; each responsible for a small part of the globe, 
					  would  be needed to keep &ldquo;pace with the weather&rdquo; in order to predict weather  conditions.&nbsp; They would be housed in a  circular hall like a theater, with 
					  galleries going around the room and a map  painted on the walls and ceiling.&nbsp; A  conductor located in the center of the hall would coordinate the calculations  using 
					  colored lights...</p>
		
					  
					  <p>While Richardson&rsquo;s  vision never became a reality, the use of mathematics to predict the weather  did develop over the years.&nbsp; This article  looks at the 
					  evolution of a science that NOAA uses everyday to deliver the  weather forecasts upon which we have come to rely on.</p>

				      <h2>The Early Evolution  of Numerical Weather Predictions</h2>
				        <p>Several decades passed after Richardson&rsquo;s initial efforts in numerical  weather prediction.&nbsp; During this time,  meteorological observation, research, and 
						technology struggled to reach the  level necessary to make the computations envisioned by Richardson.&nbsp; </p>
						
				      <p>Small, yet significant, milestones were reached during the  early part of the 20th century.&nbsp; The  first meteorological radiosonde, a balloon carrying instruments to 
					  measure  atmospheric temperature, pressure, humidity, and winds, was launched in the United States  in 1937.&nbsp; In World War II, American  pilots over the South Pacific 
					  felt the effects of the jet stream, a current of  fast-moving air found in the upper levels of the atmosphere whose presence had  previously only been theorized.&nbsp; 
					  Communication  technology grew to allow hundreds of meteorological observations to be  collected from around the globe.&nbsp; Most  importantly, by the end of World War II, 
					  the first electronic computer was  developed.&nbsp; Now, those 64,000 human  &quot;computers&quot; envisioned by Richardson  could be replaced by a single machine, albeit 
					  one that filled a 30 x 50 foot  room.&nbsp; </p>
				      <span class="imgright">

                </span>
				      <p>John von Neumann, the developer of that first computer (called  the ENIAC), recognized that the problem of weather forecasting was a natural  for his computing 
					  machinery.&nbsp; In 1948, he  assembled a group of theoretical meteorologists at the Institute  of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.&nbsp; The group was headed by 
					  Jule Charney, who had  done extensive work on developing a simplified, filtered system of equations  for weather forecasting.&nbsp; His group  constructed a successful 
					  mathematical model of the atmosphere and demonstrated  the feasibility of numerical weather prediction.&nbsp; </p>
			
					  
					  
					  <p>The first one-day, nonlinear weather prediction was made in April,  1950. Its completion required the round-the-clock services of the modelers,  and, because of several 
					  ENIAC breakdowns, more than 24 hours to execute. However,  this first forecast was successful in proving to the meteorological community  that numerical weather prediction 
					  was feasible. </p>

			         <h2>Creation of the Joint  Numerical Weather Prediction Unit</h2>
			            <p>By 1954, both modeling capability and computer power had advanced  to a point where the possibility of real-time operational numerical weather  prediction was under 
						active consideration in Europe and the United States.&nbsp; On July 1, 1954, the Joint Numerical Weather  Prediction Unit (JNWPU) was organized, staffed, and funded by 
						the U.S. Weather  Bureau, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Navy.&nbsp;  This new unit was given the mission to apply emerging computer  technology to the operational 
						production of weather forecasts.&nbsp; </p>

					  <p>Using a newly purchased IBM 701, by mid-1955, the JNWPU was  issuing numerical weather predictions twice a day.&nbsp; These early forecasts offered no competition  for 
					  the ones being produced manually.&nbsp;  However, the operational environment in which the forecasts were  produced provided the necessary impetus to rapidly identify 
					  modeling problems and  implement practical solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1958,  the forecasts being produced began to show steadily increasing and useful  skill.&nbsp; </p>

			          <h2>Continued Evolution  of Numerical Weather Prediction</h2>
			            <p>The evolution of numerical weather prediction throughout the  latter part of the 20th century proceeded at a similar pace at many operational  numerical weather 
						prediction centers around the globe.&nbsp; The first numerical weather prediction models  used in the United States  ran on grids that covered the Northern 
						Hemisphere.&nbsp; This restriction was based primarily on the  amount of computer power as well as the amount of data available to initialize  the model.&nbsp; However, a 
						progression of  more and more powerful computers procured by the National Weather Service throughout  the 1960s and 1970s as well as increasing sources of 
						data&mdash;particularly from  weather satellites&mdash;allowed the expansion of both the domains and the number of  models run.&nbsp; </p>
						
			          <p>Increases were also made in the number of vertical levels and  the horizontal resolution of the models. A three-layer hemispheric model was  introduced in 1962 and a 
					  six-layer primitive equation model appeared in 1966.&nbsp; Additional atmospheric layers allowed more  accurate forecasts of winds and temperature, resulting in better 
					  prediction of  storm motion.</p>
					  
			          <p>The first regional system concentrating on North   America, called the Limited Fine Mesh model, was implemented in  1971.&nbsp; The first global model became  operational 
					  in 1974.&nbsp; </p>

	                    <p>This graph  shows computer power and time versus model accuracy as defined by the S1 score  (a measure of the skill of the forecast) of 36- and 72-hour NCEP 500-millibar

                </span>
					  
					  
					  
					  <p>The late 1970s and the 1980s saw the introduction of the use  of spectral coordinates and advances in methods of data assimilation and more  accurate representation of 
					  physical processes in the atmosphere such as the  formation of clouds and precipitation.&nbsp; During  the 1990s, models of finer and finer scales were  developed.&nbsp; </p>
					  
			          <p>A more recent addition to the numerical weather prediction  suite of products is &ldquo;ensemble modeling.&rdquo;&nbsp;  With ensemble modeling, many forecasts are run 
					  with slightly varying  initial conditions from different models and an average, or &quot;ensemble mean,&quot;  of the different forecasts is created.&nbsp;  This ensemble 
					  mean can extend forecast skill to the two-week range  because it averages over the many possible initial states, to essentially &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;  the chaotic nature of 
					  the atmosphere. In addition, this technique provides  information about the level of uncertainty for different conditions because of  the large ensemble of forecasts 
					  available. </p>
					  
			          <p>All of the development during the 1960s &ndash; 1990s meant computer  resources were stretched to the limit.&nbsp;  As soon as new computer resources became available, 
					  they were fully  utilized with higher-resolution models with improved representation of physical  processes, using more and more sophisticated and complex modeling techniques 
					   and an increasingly larger number of observations from around the globe,  especially from satellites.&nbsp; &nbsp;Advances in predictive skill could be shown to  be 
					   directly proportional to advances in computing and modeling.&nbsp; </p>
					   
			          <p>However, the computer-based forecast is not the only reason  for the improvements in forecasting accuracy the world enjoys today.&nbsp; The interpretation of the model 
					  forecasts by  human forecasters has been shown to provide a consistent amount of additional  forecast improvement throughout the evolution of numerical weather  
					  prediction.&nbsp; Our ability to interpret the  many &ldquo;moods&rdquo; of the atmosphere has not yet been matched by equations and computer chips.</p>

					 <p>In the present day, operational numerical weather prediction  centers around the globe run a myriad of models.&nbsp; These models, some of which were developed and are run by NOAA&rsquo;s  
					 National Weather Service, produce a wide variety of products and services.&nbsp; In the United States, over 210 million  observations, the vast majority obtained from 
					 satellites, are processed and  used each day as input into global and regional models producing forecasts  for atmospheric and oceanic parameters, hurricanes, severe 
					 weather, aviation  weather, fire weather, volcanic ash, air quality, and dispersion. The current operational  computers run with a sustained computational speed of 14 
					 trillion  calculations per second.&nbsp; More than 14.8 million  model fields are generated every day, six million of which are derived from the  global ensemble 
					 runs.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					 
			          <p>In 2005, the first dynamic climate forecast system was  implemented, making forecasts out to one year.&nbsp;  Models that predict space weather on an operational basis 
					  are not far  off.&nbsp; Demands for more and more detailed  weather information increase on a regular basis.</p>

			          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
			            <p>The future holds more areas for progress in environmental modeling.&nbsp; An Earth systems modeling approach offers a  way to couple models from oceanic, land, 
						cryospheric (ice), and atmospheric  disciplines in order to transfer information among model components.&nbsp; The suite of forecast products will expand  beyond weather, 
						water, and climate services to include ecosystems and incorporate  the needs of more customers, such as the transportation, health, and energy  communities.&nbsp; </p>
						
			            <p>Numerical weather prediction has advanced significantly  since the idea was formed by Bjerknes and tested by Richardson.&nbsp;  The six weeks of tedious computations 
						endured by Richardson can now be done in the blink of an  eye. &nbsp;The past century&rsquo;s efforts have  resulted in a level of accuracy for weather prediction that 
						saves countless  lives and property each year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Numerical weather prediction can indeed be  considered one of the most significant achievements of the 20th 
						century.</p>
