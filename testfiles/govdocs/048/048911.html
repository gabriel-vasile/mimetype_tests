        world was a supercomputer. Machines with names like ENIAC and MANIAC ran 
        on vacuum tubes and filled rooms and were dedicated to solving scientific 
        problems (although often of a military nature). It was a short-lived era. 
        Today millions of far more powerful machines sit on desktops, most of 
        them doing anything but science. </p>
      <p>Today's supercomputers are certainly faster and more powerful than desktop 
        PCs, but despite dramatic increases in computational performance their 
        ability to carry out scientific applications has fallen steadily behind 
        their supposed capabilities. At least until recently. </p>

      <p>Part of the problem is that computer makers have followed the money, 
        understandably, into homes and private businesses. PCs are manufactured 
        by the millions and subject to intense competitive pressures, and their 
        processor chips have to be speedy, sophisticated devices &#151; some of 
        the most advanced microdevices in existence. But a PC's applications don't 
        access memory the way scientific applications do, so when the same kinds 
        of processors are clustered together &#151; which is one way of building 
        a supercomputer &#151; and used for doing science, they are incapable 
        of reaching anything like their theoretical peak performance. </p>
      <p>It's a problem that custom-designed supercomputers like Japan's Earth 
        Simulator don't have. The huge Earth Simulator was built virtually from 
        scratch, with its scientific sponsors (principally from the Japan Marine 
        Science and Technology Center) and contributing computer vendors (led 
        by the NEC Corporation) closely collaborating from the beginning to build 
        a machine optimized to investigate geosciences and environmental questions 
        on a global scale. When the Earth Simulator debuted in the spring of 2002, 
        reaching 87 percent of its theoretical peak performance and running at 
        35.6 teraflop/s (35.6 trillion floating-point operations per second), 
        almost five times faster than the world's next-fastest machine, it inspired 
        computer scientists around the world to have a closer look at the role 
        of supercomputers in science. </p>
      <p>In the U.S., the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and 
        other agencies formed committees and launched investigations. A typical 
        conclusion, like one from a 2004 report by the High End Computing Revitalization 
        Task Force, was that &quot;the 1990s approach of building systems based 
        on commercial off-the-shelf components&quot; was not the best way to tackle 
        applications of national importance, and that an interagency collaborative 
        approach was needed to find alternative technologies. </p>
      <p>Independently, a team of computer scientists and mathematicians at Berkeley 
        Lab, working with researchers who depend on high-end computation in such 
        diverse fields as fusion energy, molecular biology, astrophysics, nanostructures, 
        combustion, and climate modeling were already at work. They were led by 
        Horst Simon, director of Berkeley Lab's Computational Research Division 
        and of DOE's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). 
      </p>
      <p>The most recent version of the Berkeley Lab team's conclusions about 
        the most effective way to design supercomputers appears in the January, 
        2005 issue of the <em>Journal of the Earth Simulator</em> under the title 
        &quot;Science-Driven System Architecture: A New Process for Leadership 
        Class Computing.&quot; In a nutshell, they conclude that &quot;the most 
        effective approach to designing a computer architecture that can meet 
        these scientific needs is to analyze the underlying algorithms of these 
        applications and then, working in partnership with vendors, design a system 
        targeted to these algorithms.&quot; </p>
      <p>But the team did more than just produce another report. Beginning in 
        2002, with partners from other institutions, they worked closely with 
        IBM to design a machine optimized for a range of scientific applications, 
        a design they dubbed Blue Planet. Blue Planet emphasized flexibility, 
        for not all scientific problems are susceptible to the same mathematical 
        approach or have the same needs for memory access and organization &#151; 
        differences that, among others, impact hardware capabilities and organization. 
      </p>
      <p>The collaboration identified such concerns as the performance of individual 
        processors in a parallel-processing scheme, the performance of their interconnections, 
        and software adaptable to different kinds of jobs. They found specific 
        problems like &quot;memory contention&quot; in IBM's existing multiprocessor 
        design, which severely affected the performance of processors sharing 
        the same interface with main memory. They devised Virtual Vector Architecture 
        (ViVA), a way to create powerful virtual vector processors with very high 
        performance from groups of individual processors in a node. </p>

      <p>The result of these efforts was a Blue Planet processor-node design that 
        has been incorporated by IBM in the design of its new generation of microprocessors. 
        One immediate effect was the application of the Blue Planet node design 
        to the construction of the ASC Purple supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore 
        National Laboratory, scheduled to demonstrate a performance of 100 teraflop/s 
        in the summer of 2005. </p>
      <p>Many possibilities for improving supercomputer performance remain, including 
        the refinement of virtual processor architectures. But the dramatic advances 
        already achieved clearly confirm the importance of including scientists 
        in the design process from the beginning &#151; especially since, as the 
        Berkeley Lab researchers concluded, neither off-the-shelf cluster machines 
        or highly expensive special-purpose machines are the best choice for the 
        future: &quot;The high-performance systems of the future have to be balanced 
        in many ways, since the scientific applications of the future will combine 
        many different methods. There is no longer a single method that dominates.&quot;
