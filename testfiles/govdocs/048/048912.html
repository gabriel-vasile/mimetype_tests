<P ALIGN="LEFT">While remaining vigilant against the possible excesses of
government, Democrats have recognized that government makes
a unique and indispensable contribution to our economic strength,
public health, and quality of life.  This report will discuss one
significant way the federal government improves lives and
promotes economic growth: funding scientific and medical
research.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Although the Bush Administration has taken a dismissive attitude
over the past three years to science and technology policy,
federally-funded research conducted over the years by both
federal agencies and non-governmental institutions has helped
make the United States the world leader in research, placing it at
the forefront of scientific, medical, and technological advance. 
Federal investments in research have fueled the most powerful
economy in the world, creating jobs, increasing tax revenue,
improving agricultural and industrial productivity, and delivering
tangible products to save and improve the lives of Americans. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Federal research dollars support long-term, basic and applied
research that the private sector often cannot sustain because
returns on investment can take years to realize.  Many inventions
and technological innovations are the result of combining basic
findings whose connection were not anticipated at the outset. 
While industry does invest in long-range research, there are
strong disincentives to do so because the benefits of basic
research are often slow to develop and very broad, making it
difficult for any one firm to capture those benefits and to prevent
competitors from doing so. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Federal Research Funding Promotes Economic Growth<BR>
and Employment</FONT></I></B>
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Fully half of our economic productivity in the last 50 years is attributable to technological
innovation and the scientific research that supported it.  Economists estimate that the
private rates of return on research and development spending average about
24 percent, but that the economic benefits that accrue to society at-large are more than
twice as great. (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2000)  Much of
the capacity for that innovation has come from federal funding of research.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mark Heeson, President of the National Venture Capital Association, noted the
indispensable role of the government in advancing technology when he said, &quot;As
everyone knows, Venture Capitalists (VCs) don't invest in basic R&amp;D; they invest in
applied R&amp;D.  But it is critical to realize that applied R&amp;D is a product of years of
seeding of basic R&amp;D across the gamut of sciences.  And, it is the federal government
that has been a critical investor in those seeds.  Decreases in basic R&amp;D in the long run
mean fewer new ideas for VCs to look at down the road, which translates to less
innovation, fewer new high-tech jobs and fewer lives saved from new drugs and
defense-related items.&quot;
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Products and industries that have benefitted from federal research dollars include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>Computers.</B>  Computers have revolutionized the way we live, facilitating
communication, improving productivity, creating new opportunities for commerce
and leisure, and furthering scientific and technological progress itself.  In 1946, the
Department of Defense, in conjunction with University of Pennsylvania School of
Electrical Engineering, created ENIAC, the world's first all-electronic computer. 
ENIAC was monstrous, weighing over thirty tons and requiring 1,000 square feet
of space, and yet it was this prototype from which most other modern computers
evolved.  It embodied almost all the components and concepts of today's
high-speed, electronic digital computers. <BR>
<BR>
The computer sector is now a $63 billion industry in the United States, and
accounts for an estimated 250,000 manufacturing jobs.  In 2002, employment in
the computer and software industries accounted for about a half a million jobs.
(Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the National
Income and Products Account)  It is estimated that the personal computer industry
will contribute $16 billion to the U.S. economy in 2003. (Consumer Electronics
Association)<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>The Internet.</B>  In 1969, the Department of Defense developed the Internet as a
way to interconnect government computers at different sites in order to share
information and data.  It initially consisted of just four nodes at different locations,
but was subsequently augmented with funding from the National Science
Foundation (NSF).  Following the development of the World Wide Web in Europe
in 1988, NSF's National Center for Supercomputing Applications introduced a
graphical user interface called Mosaic in 1993. </LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">	The Internet is now an integral part of the U.S. economy.  According to a January
2001 University of Texas study, the internet economy (made up of infrastructure
and applications firms, electronic intermediaries, and online sellers) supported
more than three million workers in 2000.  In the same period, the internet
economy generated an estimated $830 billion in revenues, a 58 percent increase
over the preceding year (Center for Research in Electronic Commerce, University
of Texas).<BR>
<BR>

</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>Semiconductors.</B>  The federal government has played a significant role in
supporting the growth of the semiconductor industry since its inception.  Many of
the engineers who have played pivotal roles in the development and improvement
of semiconductors were trained with federal research grants.  Moreover, in the
mid-1980s, the federal government and the U.S. semiconductor industry formed
SEMATECH, a public-private consortium to redress the industry's competitive
decline at that time.  As a result, the U.S. chip industry saw a major resurgence in
the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
The semiconductor industry is one of U.S. manufacturing's star performers.  On
the strength of a 17 percent annual growth rate, its output climbed from 1.5
percent of manufacturing GDP in 1987 to 6.5 percent in 2000.  In 1999, when it
posted $102 billion in sales, it accounted for not only half the world market in its
product but also for over 5 percent of manufacturing value-added in the U.S.
economy, making it the manufacturing sector's leader.  It boasted 284,000
employees as of August 2001 and paid them an average hourly wage 50 percent
higher in real terms than it had 30 years before.  It also provides the core of the
$425 billion U.S. electronics industry. (National Academy of Sciences)<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Advances in biotechnology.</B>  Federal funding in biology, food science,
agriculture, genetics, and drugs has enabled the development and expansion of
America's world-class biotechnology industry.  The most visible contribution of the
federal government over the past decade is the just-completed, 13-year U.S.
Human Genome Project coordinated by the Department of Energy and the
National Institutes of Health.  The project promises to further catalyze the U.S.
biotechnology industry by licensing technologies to private companies and
awarding grants for innovative biomedical research.<BR>
<BR>
In 2001, the American biotechnology industry supported $28.5 billion in annual
sales and 535,000 American jobs. (Biotechnology Industry Association)<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Energy saving technologies.</B>  Today, energy efficiency is led by entrepreneurial
private-sector firms and utilities, but many of the products sold and installed by
this industry are the product of partnerships between the federal government and
private industry.  In the mid-1970s, the Department of Energy (DOE) began a
program to establish energy conservation standards for certain household
appliances.  In the late 1970s, scientists at DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory spearheaded the development of electronic ballasts for flourescent
lights, reducing lighting energy use by up to 30 percent in a typical building
environment.  Similarly, in 1976, DOE began a program at the Lawrence Berkeley
lab that led to the commercialization of &quot;low-emissivity&quot; windows, which reduced
wintertime energy losses through normal, double-glazed windows by 35 percent.<BR>
<BR>
According to DOE, current appliance standards have already saved consumers
$1.9 billion in energy costs, and ultimately will save consumers $58 billion over the
lifetimes of appliances installed between 1990 and 2015.  Between 1988 and
1995, electronic ballasts had saved American consumers $1 billion in energy
costs.  The U.S. lighting industry continues to enjoy growth in sales of $430 million
each year, corresponding to the extra retail value of efficient ballasts.  As of 1995,
the new designs and materials for windows had saved consumers $2.1 billion in
energy costs, and U.S. businesses and consumer are expected to save $17 billion
from advanced window technologies installed through the year 2015.  According
to the Lawrence Berkeley lab, the U.S. window industry continues to enjoy growth
in sales of $650 million each year, corresponding to the higher value of efficient
windows.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Fuel cell development. </B> Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce
electricity and water, and promise to efficiently deliver energy while producing
virtually no pollution.  Research performed through NASA's Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program has been instrumental in advancing the
development and commercialization of fuel cells.  The research stemmed from
NASA's need for high-power, long-durational electric generation systems for use
on high-altitude science platforms.  It has since resulted in a number of new
commercial fuel cell products.<BR>
<BR>
As the technology matures, fuel cells promise to provide abundant electricity and
propulsion power without harming the environment.  The technology's scalability
also makes fuel cells ideal for supplying power to stand-alone operations and in
remote locations.  Recent industry estimates project that the fuel cell market will
reach $19 to $35 billion by 2013 (<I>Chemical Week, </I>10/15/2003).<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Global Positioning System.</B>  In 1973, the Department of Defense was looking for
a foolproof method of satellite navigation.  Based on previous department
experience with satellites, the concept of a Global Positioning System (GPS) was
developed.  The first operational GPS satellite was launched in 1978, and the
system reached full 24-satellite capability in 1993.  GPS can now be used to
rescue soldiers stranded behind enemy lines, and to help backpackers,
firefighters, sailors, and drivers locate their exact position.<BR>
<BR>
The current worldwide market for GPS receivers and technology is estimated at
over $2 billion.  Within the next decade, this market is expected to surpass $30
billion (National Academy of Sciences).<BR>

</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the world's foremost medical research
centers, and the federal focal point for medical research in the U.S.  It provides grants
and contracts to support research in over 2,000 research institutions in the U.S. and
abroad, and conducts more than 2,000 research projects in its own laboratories.  NIH
grants have also trained a host of scientists in its intramural programs and supported
the training of hundreds of thousands of scientists at universities and medical schools
around the country through research grants.  The list of those scientists who have
received NIH support over the years includes 106 Nobel Laureates, five of whom made
their prize-winning discoveries in NIH laboratories.  NIH reports a number of scientific
advances supported by its research dollars, including:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>Improved understanding of heart disease.  </B>In 1948, NIH inaugurated the
Framingham Heart Study, a project to identify the common factors or
characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD).  At the time, little
was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death
rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and
had become an American epidemic.  Over the years, careful monitoring of the
Framingham Study population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk
factors - high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes,
and physical inactivity.  Since its inception, the study has produced approximately
1,200 articles, making the concept of CVD risk factors integral to the medical
curriculum.  This has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive
strategies in clinical practice.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Chemotherapy as a standard treatment for cancer.</B>  Work done during the
1950's and 1960's by NIH researchers led to the development of the first
successful cures for a leukemia.  This played a major role in establishing
chemotherapy as a standard cancer treatment.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Cigarette - lung cancer link.</B>  In the late 1990's, researchers supported by NIH
found the first direct biological link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. 
Scientists had long associated cigarette smoking with lung cancer, but this
discovery uncovered the molecular basis for how smoking leads to lung cancer.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Breast cancer treatment validation.</B>  In the mid-1990's, researchers supported
by NIH showed that women at high risk of developing breast cancer who took
tamoxifen had 49 percent fewer cases of breast cancer than those who did not. 
Tamoxifen has been hailed as the first drug to prevent breast cancer in women at
high-risk for the disease.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Anti-cancer drug.</B>  In 2001, NIH funded the lion's share of the basic research
that eventually led to the discovery and development by the drug company
Novartis of a new drug known as Gleevec.  It is the first anti-cancer drug
specifically developed to target a molecular problem that causes a particular type
of cancer, in this case, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Searching for a diabetes treatment.</B>  In 2002, scientists at NIH and the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center successfully used the hormone
leptin to treat patients suffering from lipodystrophy, a rare and difficult to treat
disorder that shares some of the characteristics of typical type 2 diabetes. 
Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. and is responsible for
$92 billion in direct medical costs per year.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Epilepsy treatment.</B>  In the early 1990's, NIH scientists helped to develop a major
new drug for epilepsy, felbamate, that is safe at high doses and does not have
side effects commonly associated with other antiepileptic drugs.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Decrease in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</B>  Between 1992 and 1996, the rate
of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) dropped by 38 percent.  Much of that
drop was likely due to a 66 percent decrease during the same period in the
number of U.S. infants being placed to sleep on their stomachs.  The Back to
Sleep Campaign, a national campaign that encourages infants to be placed to
sleep on their backs, was launched by the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development (NICHD) in partnership with several other organizations in
1994.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Advances in rubella detection and prevention.</B>  In the 1960's, NIH researchers
developed the first licensed rubella vaccine and the first test for rubella antibodies
that was practical for large scale testing (rubella hemagglutination inhibition test). 
Deaths from rubella have decreased 99 percent since the vaccine became
available.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Juvenile typhoid vaccine.</B>  In 2001, NIH researchers and others supported by
NIH developed and tested the first vaccine capable of protecting children ages 2
to 5 against typhoid fever.  Seemingly the most effective typhoid vaccine ever
developed, it is also virtually free of side effects.  About 16 million people
worldwide develop typhoid each year, and 600,000 die from the disease.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Mother-infant HIV transmission treatment.</B>  In the late 1990's, researchers
supported by NIH demonstrated an affordable and practical strategy for preventing
transmission of the HIV virus from mother to infant.  A single oral dose of the
antiretroviral drug nevirapine given to an HIV-infected woman in labor and
another to her baby within three days of birth reduced the transmission of virus by
half compared with a similar short course of AZT.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Smallpox vaccine dilution trial.</B>  In 2002, an NIH-supported clinical trial
demonstrated that the existing U.S. supply of smallpox vaccine - 15.4 million
doses - could successfully be diluted up to five times and retain its potency,
greatly expanding the number of people it could protect from the contagious
disease.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Staph bacteria vaccine.</B>  In 2002, NIH scientists and the company Nabi
developed the first successful vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus, a major
cause of infection and death among hospital patients.  Recently, researchers have
discovered strains of the bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics used to treat
them, making a preventive vaccine critical.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Urinary incontinence treatment.</B>  In 2002, researchers supported by NIH
showed that rural older women with urinary incontinence (UI) could use behavioral
changes, such as bladder training, and pelvic muscle exercises with biofeedback,
to reduce their UI severity by 61 percent.  UI is a leading reason for people in rural
areas to move to a nursing home, and controlling it leads to a better quality of life
and allows people to remain in their homes longer.<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The National Institutes of Health is not the only source of federally-funded advances in
medical technology.  A number of other federal agencies, including the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), have supported research that has improved public health in the
United States and around the world. 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>Advances in medical laser technology.  </B>Laser technology that originated in
NASA's satellite-based atmospheric studies in the mid-1980s has been applied to
a variety of medical fields.  NASA-developed switching technology, for instance,
was used to produce a uniform controllable laser beam maintained at a low
working temperature.  Lasers of this type are being used to correct myopia
(nearsightedness) and to perform laser angioplasty, which vaporizes blockages in
coronary arteries.<BR>
<BR>
	Laser angioplasty is helping to prevent cardiac arrest with a success rate of
85 percent at opening blocked arteries.  At the same time, this procedure
positively impacts patients' recovery time, costs and productivity.  The same type
of technology allows medical facilities, in a one-minute procedure, to correct
myopia.  According to NASA there are an estimated 60 million nearsighted
Americans who will not need glasses if they undergo this procedure.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Breast biopsy system.  </B>Technology developed at NASA's Goddard Space
Center for the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 has found a new application in
breast biopsies.  A high technology silicon chip converts light directly into
electronic or digital images that can be manipulated and enhanced by computers. 
Known as stereotactic core needle biopsy, the procedure is performed under local
anesthesia with a needle instead of a scalpel, leaving a small puncture wound
rather than a large scar.<BR>
<BR>
	Recent statistics from the American Cancer Society show that
approximately one in nine women in the United States will develop breast cancer
at some point in their lives.  This new technique, which is replacing surgical biopsy
as the method of choice in many cases, is saving women pain, scarring, time, and
money.  Compared to traditional surgery, the new procedure is just as effective
and can be performed in a physician's office for about one-quarter the cost. 
NASA estimated in 1997 that this procedure would reduce national health care
costs by about $1 billion a year.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>	<B>Advanced pacemaker.  </B>In 1969, NASA and the Applied Physics Laboratory of
Johns Hopkins University began working with private industry to apply
NASA-developed aerospace technology into pacemakers.  Through this
collaboration, technology originally designed for two-way communication with
satellites has been used since 1997 as a means of communicating with and
reprogramming pacemakers without the need for further surgery.  Additionally,
space microminiaturization technology and spacecraft electrical power system
technology have been applied to produce the first single-chip pacemakers with
rechargeable, long-life batteries. <BR>
<BR>
Pacemakers help people with heart rhythm disorders live longer, more productive
lives.  According to NASA, by the late 1990's, the U.S. pacemaker market totaled
over $1 billion annually and was on a trajectory to continue growing at a rate of
8 percent annually.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>	<B>New DNA biochip technology. </B> While working on a project to develop advanced
biosensors in 1994, scientists at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National
Laboratory developed a DNA diagnostic biochip.  The hand-sized device, which
uses less blood than current procedures, may eventually be used to diagnose
diseases such as AIDS, cancer and tuberculosis in the doctor's office without the
need for a separate testing facility. <BR>
<BR>
	According to NASA, many drugs work on less than 50 percent of all
patients and there are approximately 100,000 deaths each year in the US
resulting from the adverse effects of medication.  Biochip technology will support
more specific diagnostics, prediction of response to drugs, and safer,
individualized medication. <BR>

<LI>	<B>Infrared Thermometer.  </B>NASA's Technology Affiliates Program seeks to improve
the competitiveness of American industries by facilitating the transfer of
government-developed technology to the private sector.  Through this program,
technology initially used to view and measure the emitted infrared radiation from
planets and stars was refined in the late-1980's and early-1990's to develop the
infrared thermometer.  This almost instantaneous method of taking body
temperatures, introduced to the commercial market in 1990, is easier and much
faster (1 second as compared to 30 seconds) than previous oral or rectal
methods.  <BR>

	According to NASA, the economic potential for the thermometer worldwide
for acute care hospitals is approximately $126 million a year.  A roughly similar
value is predicted for sales to alternate care facilities, such as clinics, physician's
offices, and nursing homes as well as to individuals.  Furthermore, infrared
thermometers save considerable valuable time for hospital personnel and are less
intrusive to the patient.<BR>

<LI>	<B>Advances in dental technology.</B>  In the late 1920's, laboratories at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began what continues to be a
collaboration with the American Dental Association to develop, refine, and
generally improve medical practice through the invention of new dental materials,
tools and methods.  One of the more significant advances to come out of this
collaboration was the introduction in the late 1950s of new polymeric and
mineral-based materials for aesthetic tooth restoration and the development of
metallic alloys for amalgams. <BR>
<BR>
	Over the past four decades, American dentists have made hundreds of
millions of restorations with these dental polymers.  It was estimated in 1987 that
the increased durability of composite restorations, and thereby the reduction of
replacement costs of previously used materials, saved Americans more than the
combined appropriated budgets of NIST, the ADA, and the National Institute of
Dental Research.  The U.S. market for these products is now $163 million per
year (American Dental Association, National Institute of Standards and
Technology, and Strategic Dental Marketing Corp.).<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The federal government has played a key role in ensuring that the United States
continues to lead the world in scientific and technological progress.  Senate Democrats
understand that federal investments in research and development are investments in
people.  Democrats will continue to support investments in research to strengthen our
economy, create jobs, and improve the health and well-being of all Americans.
