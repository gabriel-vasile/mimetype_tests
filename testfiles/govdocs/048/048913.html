							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Thank you, Paula, for your introduction. I would also 
							like to thank Laura Roskos and Phyllis Strimling for 
							inviting me to join you at Radcliffe this evening.</p>
						<p>It is a pleasure to be part of your lecture series, 
							and I am especially grateful to everyone for graciously 
							accommodating the changes in my schedule.</p>
						<p>My talk tonight is called "From Glass Ceiling to Crystal 
							Ball: A Vision of Women in Science."</p>
						<p>However, before launching into my main theme today, 
							I would like to tell you just a little bit about what 
							happened earlier today at the National Science Foundation.</p>
						<p>We presented the NSF budget proposal for the coming 
							year.</p>
						<p>As you know, agencies across the government are facing 
							constraints this year, but I will not spend time on 
							the details here, except to say that NSF has been 
							chosen to take the lead in math and science education.</p>
						<p>A centerpiece of the FY2002 budget request is an initial 
							$200 million of $1 billion over five years for a new 
							Math and Science Partnerships Initiative, part of 
							President Bush's education plan.</p>
						<p>The initiative is focused on links between higher education 
							and K-12 education. This is an area that needs a great 
							deal of effort--the integration of research and education. 
							The new partnerships will bring us closer to that 
							goal.</p>
						<p>It's a pleasure to be <i>here</i> tonight, on what 
							is <i>also</i> familiar turf. For me, Cambridge is 
							pretty close to home. I grew up in Massachusetts, 
							in Beverly, a stone's throw from the ocean.</p>
						<p>My mother still lives in the family home just a block 
							down the road from this lighthouse in Beverly Cove.</p>
						<p>I have very fond memories of sailing in regattas in 
							Marblehead, and my husband and I have raced in the 
							Nationals for our two-man dinghy class in Marblehead 
							several times.</p>
						<p>Not all memories of the past are as warm, yet some 
							of them do bear upon our topic tonight, which is my 
							reflections on women in science and engineering.</p>
						<p>For example, when I went to high school, girls simply 
							were not allowed to take physics. More to the point, 
							my high school chemistry teacher told me I would never 
							make it in chemistry--because women could not.</p>
						<p>That angered me, but also galvanized me. I had begun 
							to see science as a way to understand the world and 
							as a way to make my way in the world.</p>
						<p>At Purdue University, many of my counterparts were 
							majoring in home economics, learning how to make souffles 
							while I was learning how to balance equations.</p>
						<p>In my senior year at Purdue, I found the encouragement 
							of a good mentor--Professor Dorothy Powelson. It was 
							rare in those days, back in the fifties, to have a 
							woman professor.</p>
						<p>She opened the door, and I became entranced by the 
							microscopic world. That enthusiasm was an asset when 
							encountering various roadblocks along the way.</p>
						<p>For my masters degree, for example, I counted 186,000 
							fruitflies, studying crossing-over in the linkage 
							map of Drosophila, the fruitfly. Now we have the entire 
							genome of Drosophila sequenced!</p>
						<p>Today, no one would ever say outright that they would 
							not "waste" a fellowship on a woman--like I was told 
							in the 1950s. Yet girls and women still have a long 
							way to go to achieve equity in all phases of scientific 
							and engineering education and careers.</p>
						<p>The problems are highly complex and not all solutions 
							are clear. That is why I prefer to discard the metaphor 
							of the "glass ceiling" as too fragile to bear the 
							weight of what we need to learn and change.</p>
						<p>Instead I will offer the crystal ball as a symbol of 
							being able to see our way through and beyond established 
							strictures that keep girls even today from taking 
							flight though the discovery of science and engineering.</p>
						<p>This new metaphor presents us with clearer vision and 
							a multitude of futures.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld002.htm">[bullet slide]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Knowing the past often helps when we want to change 
							our future. Women have a long and distinguished history 
							in science although we still do not learn much about 
							past pioneers.</p>
						<p>It is eye-opening to bring to light even a few of these 
							poorly known stories. Some of these women's lives 
							actually border on the tragic. Then we'll look at 
							where women stand today in mathematics, science and 
							engineering, from elementary school up through the 
							labor force.</p>
						<p>Mathematics as a gateway to science and engineering 
							deserves special mention. Then I'll cite a few examples 
							of programs by the National Science Foundation to 
							attract girls and women into these fields.</p>
						<p>Finally, I will explore some trends that are transforming 
							science and engineering, and suggest how women may 
							be shaping some of these changes.</p>
						<p>Some of you have probably read or heard of the scientific 
							bestseller, <i>Galileo's Daughter</i>, by Dava Sobel. 
							NSF's National Science Board has given its public 
							service award to Sobel this year for her book.</p>
						<p>As we read Maria Celeste's letters to her father, the 
							eminent Galileo, the dynamic personality of his daughter 
							is revealed. She copies his manuscripts for him and 
							takes avid interest in his scientific inquiries.</p>
						<p>We can speculate how Maria Celeste--with all her intelligence, 
							energy, and perseverance--might have succeeded in 
							science herself in a later era that would not have 
							consigned her to the life of a cloistered nun.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld003.htm">[Alice Evans in 
							her lab]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Jumping several centuries to our own, we find women 
							who accomplished much in science, but whose stories 
							are seldom told.</p>
						<p>One is Alice Catherine Evans, who studied the bacterial 
							contamination of milk, and identified the organism 
							that causes undulant fever in humans.</p>
						<p>At a time when bacteriology was in its infancy, she 
							challenged the wisdom of her scientific peers, triggering 
							enormous controversy in the medical and dairy communities.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, Evans' work extracted a heavy personal 
							toll. She contracted undulant fever while doing her 
							research and suffered its effects for two decades.</p>
						<p>Her pioneering work led to the near-elimination of 
							undulant fever through the mandatory pasteurization 
							of milk in this country, starting in the 1930s.</p>
						<p>Another example is Rosalind Franklin. History now inextricably 
							links the names Watson and Crick with the revelation 
							of the structure of DNA. How few have heard of Rosalind 
							Franklin.</p>
						<p>Her x-ray studies revealed critical evidence of DNA's 
							helical structure, but she never received the full 
							credit she deserved. Her early death prevented her 
							work from ever being considered by the Nobel committee.</p>
						<p>That work, which was "purloined" by Jim Watson--to 
							use his own words--helped him to win his Nobel Prize.</p>
						<p>Another woman who <i>did</i> receive the Nobel Prize--Barbara 
							McClintock--nonetheless suffered from scientific isolation 
							during her career. McClintock won the Nobel for her 
							discovery of "mobile genetic elements."</p>
						<p>Through her studies of corn, beginning in the late 
							1940s, she proposed the existence of transposons--genes 
							that can change position, carrying other genetic material 
							along. McClintock's discoveries had huge significance 
							for biology and medicine.</p>
						<p>On a personal note, I can recall a college professor 
							of mine muttering that he was forced to teach us McClintock's 
							findings on "jumping genes," but that he did not believe 
							the theories of this "crazy woman."</p>
						<p>Other forgotten females in science and engineering 
							were the six women chosen to program the ENIAC--the 
							Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer--during 
							World War II. ENIAC was the first large electronic 
							computer.</p>
						<p>The job title of the women was actually "computer." 
							(The old usage of the term "computer" referred to 
							the people--usually women--who did mathematical calculations.) 
							However, they were considered sub-professionals because 
							of their gender.</p>
						<p>One of the women, Jean Bartik, worked on the ENIAC 
							at the age of twenty. Looking back, she recalls,</p>
						<blockquote> 
							<p>"We lived and breathed computers. I thought I had 
								died and gone to heaven. I had never been around 
								so many brilliant people in my life...We had no 
								manuals for ENIAC. We learned how to program by 
								studying the logical block diagrams. What a blessing. 
								From the beginning I knew how computers worked." 
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld004.htm">[science proficiency 
							of boys and girls]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>It helps to learn about those few who preceded us. 
							Others with stories worth remembering include astronomers 
							Jocelyn Bell and Henrietta Leavitt, and physicist 
							Lise Meitner.</p>
						<p>Even today, however, far too many girls and women fail 
							to even cross the threshold into science and engineering. 
							We know that obstacles and stereotyped cultural conditioning 
							begin to appear very early in life.</p>
						<p>In a study of young children reported in the recent 
							book <i>Athena Unbound</i>, a four-year-old boy told 
							researchers that "...only boys should make science."</p>
						<p>Part of the problem today lies in what I call the "valley 
							of death" in education: grades 4 through 8, when girls 
							are discouraged--in subtle and not so subtle ways--from 
							pursuing science and engineering.</p>
						<p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress shows 
							a gender gap in science proficiency as early as age 
							9. We can trace this through ages 13 and to age 17, 
							when the gap has widened further.</p>
						<p>There has been little change in this trend over two 
							decades. In a moment I'll describe a few of NSF's 
							gender equity programs for those ages.</p>
						<p>No doubt many of you have heard the term "leaky pipeline." 
							It's an apt phrase for the loss of women in science 
							and engineering throughout higher education, and continuing 
							in academia, through the route to full professor.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld005.htm">[percent of bachelor's 
							degrees earned by women, 1975-97]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>It is interesting that between ages 25 and 34, the 
							typical American female is more educated than her 
							male counterpart. Women now earn more than half of 
							all college degrees, and over half of those in the 
							life sciences. Well over 40% of math and chemistry 
							bachelor's degrees also go to females.</p>
						<p>But some developments are deeply disturbing. For example, 
							the percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees 
							in computer science has been dropping since the mid-1980s. 
							We see a downward trend for both men and women--but 
							it's been more precipitous for women.</p>

							women]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>If we take a closer look at doctorates earned in the 
							United States by women, we see a divergence among 
							the disciplines. Women now earn around 40% of all 
							doctorates. However, this differs greatly by field.</p>
						<p>In the life sciences, women earn over 40% of doctorates. 
							But in the physical sciences and mathematics, women 
							earn fewer than 20%. In engineering, they receive 
							a little over 10% of PhDs.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld007.htm">[MIT graph and 
							quote]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>A couple of years ago, the Massachusetts Institute 
							of Technology took a close and courageous look at 
							women on its science faculty, releasing its study 
							in 1999.</p>
						<p>Introducing the report, MIT president Charles M. Vest 
							wrote, "I have always believed that contemporary gender 
							discrimination within universities is part reality 
							and part perception. True, but I now understand that 
							reality is by far the greater part of the balance."</p>
						<p>As the study began in 1994, the MIT School of Science 
							had only 15 tenured women, versus 194 men.</p>
						<p>The subsequent study, which took much determination 
							and effort, found that women science faculty had been 
							"marginalized" throughout their careers, facing discrimination 
							in salary, awards, space, and other parameters.</p>
						<p>We look forward to following MIT's response to the 
							report as it evolves. All of us can benefit from the 
							lessons emerging at MIT.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld008.htm">[U.S. workforce, 
							1997]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Our problem is larger than the institutions of higher 
							learning. In more than 400 job categories in our economy, 
							women are found mainly in only 20 categories.</p>
						<p>Women comprise less than a quarter of the total science 
							and engineering labor force. The S&E workforce looks 
							very exclusive. This is dangerous for the nation. 
							We need the talent of every worker in order to compete 
							and prosper.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld009.htm">[Land of Plenty]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Some of you may be familiar with the report called 
							<i>Land of Plenty</i>, issued last year by the Congressional 
							Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities 
							in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development.</p>
						<p>The commission calls diversity our country's competitive 
							edge. The commission states this: if women, minorities, 
							and the disabled--two-thirds of U.S. workers--joined 
							the science and engineering workforce in proportion 
							to their numbers, the shortage in skilled S&T workers 
							would "largely be eliminated."</p>
						<p>However, if our country continues to exclude so many 
							citizens from the new economy, the report warns that 
							"our nation will risk losing its economic and intellectual 
							preeminence."</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld010.htm">[Mathematical knot 
							with quote about importance of math]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>At this point I want to highlight the key role of mathematics. 
							Mathematics is the single most important factor leading 
							to a career in science and engineering. </p>
						<p>The American Association of University Women has recommended 
							that states should make algebra and geometry mandatory 
							for all students. These are the "gatekeeper" classes 
							for college admission and later study in math, science 
							and engineering.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld011.htm">[Poster: woman 
							and line, I am a mathematician]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>We know that we have been able to narrow the gender 
							gap in mathematical performance for young women, which 
							is a hopeful sign for the future and also evidence 
							that the gender gap in performance is not a genetic 
							gap.</p>
						<p>The National Science Foundation supports a number of 
							programs to improve girls' math participation and 
							performance.</p>
						<p>For example, we have partially sponsored a series of 
							striking science posters by artist Pamela Davis Kivelson, 
							including some that use creative, visual means to 
							promote the power of mathematics to young people.</p>
						<p>One shows a young woman with the legend, "I am a mathematician." 
							Another idea to consider, perhaps--suggested by one 
							of our program officers--is a campaign called "Math 
							for Moms."</p>
						<p>Biologist E.O. Wilson writes that "...mathematics seems 
							to point arrow-like toward the ultimate goal of objective 
							truth." Given the accelerating cross-pollination of 
							mathematics and science, it's not a mere coincidence 
							that Wilson is a biologist.</p>
						<p>Indeed, mathematics is the ultimate cross-cutting discipline, 
							the springboard for advances across the board. Mathematics 
							is both a powerful tool of insight and a common language 
							for science. </p>
						<p>As a biologist I find the burgeoning two-way traffic 
							between biology and mathematics especially exciting. 
							Not only is mathematics revolutionizing biology, but 
							biology begins to foster new paradigms in mathematics.</p>
						<p>The information science of life edges ever closer to 
							electronic information science. Advances in understanding 
							life may lead to new algorithms and new modes of computing, 
							notably biological computing.</p>
						<p>However, our country's world leadership of mathematics 
							is fragile. We have been relying on overseas talent 
							and have not been attracting enough U.S. students. 
							In the meantime, NSF's role in support of mathematics 
							has become ever more important.</p>
						<p>We provide about two-thirds of federal academic research 
							support, and our share is growing. In fact, a key 
							feature of our budget investment this year is $20 
							million for interdisciplinary mathematics.</p>
						<p>It will expand our support for fundamental research 
							in mathematics to the entire spectrum of science and 
							engineering in our portfolio.</p>

						<p>NSF has a number of other programs that target girls 
							and women in math, science and engineering at all 
							ages.</p>
						<p>An excellent program in San Diego intervenes early, 
							focusing on teaching about computing and science to 
							minority girls in grades four-through-eight. The program 
							is led by the San Diego Girl Scouts and the San Diego 
							Supercomputer Center.</p>
						<p>Girl Scout adult teachers have now trained about 5000 
							girls on computers. The program is being expanded 
							to Houston. The girls' entire families get into the 
							act on Family Nights for hands-on computer learning.

						<p>NSF funds gender equity research across the country, 
							planting seeds in the form of pilot programs. One 
							example, in Carson City School district in Nevada, 
							focused on 10 Hispanic girls who barely knew English.</p>
						<p>Within a year, they had learned English using a computerized 
							tutor; learned to use computers; could make presentations 
							about a Geographic Information System; and were being 
							sought out by employers. Nevada's Department of Education

						<p>Computer games--often the first exposure kids have 
							to computers--are one factor that can turn off girls. 
							They dislike the violent, repetitive and sexist elements 
							of the games that are widely available.</p>
						<p>They ask for identity games in which they could create 
							a character or build a world, with chances to communicate 
							and collaborate. NSF has funded a game called "Josie

							men need to participate in these changes, and they 
							are eligible for all three types of awards.</p> <ul class="top">
							<li><i>Fellows awards</i> give those who had limits 
								to their career advancement--perhaps because of 
								raising children, other family needs, or related 
								factors--a chance to jumpstart the continuation 
								of careers. <br>
								<br>
							<li><i>The second type of award</i>, for institutional 
								transformation, supports institutions that define 
								effective approaches to drawing women faculty 
								into the upper ranks. <br>
								<br>
							<li><i>Leadership awards</i>, the third type, recognize 
								contributions toward increasing the participation 
								of women in academic science and engineering careers. 
						</ul>
						<p>The NSF program manager for ADVANCE, Alice Hogan, emphasizes 
							that the program sends the message that NSF values 
							and rewards the hard work needed to change the conditions 
							for women in science and engineering--and gives participants 
							an opportunity to make a real difference over the 
							long-term.</p>

							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>I should also underscore that NSF's <i>largest</i> 
							investment in women scientists and engineers is through 
							all our other research and education efforts.</p>
						<p>NSF support for women researchers has tripled over 
							the past decade to approach 500 million dollars.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld017.htm">[sunspot shot]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Let me broaden our perspective now, looking back into 
							that crystal ball as a wider lens to scan the entire 
							spectrum of discovery in science and engineering, 
							which we want to open to the participation of all.</p>
						<p>We have entered the Age of Knowledge and we need to 
							transform our educational system into one of lifelong 
							learning so that everyone benefits.</p>
						<p>New tools are broadening our vision in every discipline. 
							In just one very current example, we are able to look 
							at our sun, and we are seeing the largest group of 
							sunspots in a decade.</p>
						<p>The sun has an 11-year cycle; right now it is in the 
							phase of high activity called solar maximum. The sun's 
							activity fosters geomagnetic disruption, and we have 
							reached the point of being able to predict these effects, 
							now called space weather.</p>
						<p>The sunspot areas have been erupting in just the past 
							couple of weeks, disrupting radio communications and 
							low-frequency navigation signals on Earth.</p>
						<p>We are graced to be alive at a time when science and 
							engineering are extending our vision to the farthest 
							reaches of the cosmos, back to the time of the Big 
							Bang.</p>
						<p>At the same time we can peer down into the most minute 
							scales of life, decoding the blueprint of life for 
							our species, the human genome, and learning the secrets 
							of life for all our fellow travelers.</p>
						<p>The scientific tool most familiar to me as a microbiologist 
							is, of course, the microscope. It is the tool that 
							represents an approach that much of modern science 
							has followed up to now: to seek understanding by taking 
							things apart into their components. </p>
						<p>To be sure, this strategy has given us the lion's share 
							of scientific knowledge to date, but it has been a 
							reductionist approach.</p>
						<p>As science and engineering grow ever more interwoven, 
							we fashion new, more integrative tools. We watch our 
							fields intersect increasingly with one other to forge 
							new frontiers at every scale, from quarks to stars.</p>
						<p>Only through mapping and nourishing these linkages 
							can we truly reflect and probe the wholeness of the 
							world that we study. The days are gone when a discipline 
							could go it alone. Now, the entire enterprise must 
							progress as a whole.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld018.htm">[LIGO]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>On another frontier, the border between astronomy and 
							physics, researchers are listening for gravitational 
							waves. The LIGO Project, short for Laser Interferometry 
							Gravitational Wave Observatory, is the largest project 
							NSF has ever supported.</p>
						<p>LIGO is searching for the waves produced by colliding 
							black holes or collapsing supernovae. If these ripples 
							in the fabric of space-time are recorded, they will 
							open up a new window on the universe.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld019.htm">[GriPhyN]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>These explorations are not taking place in isolation. 
							LIGO, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and CERN, the European 
							accelerator laboratory, will ultimately be linked 
							together in the Grid Physics Network (GriPhyN). </p>
						<p>This computational grid will tie together resources 
							from the United States and Europe. Many disciplines 
							share a similar need for widely dispersed users to 
							access and use a massive data set.</p>
						<p>These include projects on the human brain and genome, 
							to those who study astronomy, geophysics, crystallography, 
							and satellite weather, to consumer spending and banking 
							records. These latter uses require advances that preserve 
							consumer privacy as well.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld020.htm">[adaptive optics: 
							Neptune]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Another example of blending boundaries is the refinement 
							and application of a technique called adaptive optics. 
							Large ground-based telescopes, it turns out, have 
							their views into space blurred by the earth's shimmering 
							atmosphere.</p>
						<p>Some are being fitted with adaptive optics to correct 
							for the distortion.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld021.htm">[AO: blurry "E"s 
							]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>We're now applying adaptive optics to human vision. 
							So far tests have shown that adaptive optics doubles 
							the sensitivity of the eye in low light.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld022.htm">[Oldest microorganism]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Our new vistas also extend our concept of life. Even 
							in the most extreme environments on our planet, in 
							ocean vents, within the deepest mines, and in the 
							seeming wastes of Antarctica, we are finding life, 
							thriving and abundant.</p>
						<p>The oldest living organism found so far, a 250 million-year-old 
							bacterium, was described last fall.</p>
						<p>It was found entombed in salt crystals 850 feet down 
							in the Permian Salado Formation in New Mexico, by 
							Russ Vreeland, a former student, and his colleagues. 
							Needless to say, we never imagined life to survive 
							in pure salt.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld023.htm">[bees and nanosensors]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Our tools give us insight on the smallest of scales. 
							Foremost among them are nano-science and technology, 
							whose applications are only limited by our imaginations.</p>
						<p>At the Lilliputian level of the nanoscale, we see how 
							nanotechnology is being used to understand the Earth's 
							biodiversity.</p>
						<p>Researchers have developed microscopic nanosensors 
							that are carried like ordinary pollen on the body 
							of a bee. A bee collects the sensor, called smart 
							dust, and carries it throughout its normal daily activities.</p>
						<p>When it returns to the hive, a sensor plate downloads 
							the data collected by the sensor. The result is a 
							map of the bee's itinerary: where it traveled and 
							which flowers it visited.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld024.htm">[Women at water 
							source]</a></b> <i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Only integrating information from many scales will 
							lead us to deeper discoveries. In my own research, 
							I have spent more than 30 years studying cholera, 
							a terrible water-borne scourge that still causes thousands 
							to die every year in developing countries.</p>
						<p>My work on the environmental factors associated with 
							cholera epidemics would be impossible without the 
							power of computing.</p>
						<p>At the same time, our research continues at the scale 
							of the village, where women in Bangladesh are testing 
							a simple filtering system for their drinking water. 
							They are using sari cloth to remove plankton and particulate 
							matter to which the cholera bacteria are attached.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld025.htm">[cholera, SST]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>Remote sensing and computing have helped us to delineate 
							the <i>patterns</i> in the incidence of cholera. Its 
							occurrence is related to environmental factors, whether 
							in the Bay of Bengal or off the coast of South America.</p>
						<p>Sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll concentrations, 
							and sea surface height are all elevated when cholera 
							appears. It is our ability to integrate insights from 
							many levels that leads us to the threshold of predicting 
							cholera epidemics.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld026.htm">[biocomplexity]</a></b> 
							<i><br>
							(Use "back" to return to the text.)</i></p>
						<p>There are many such examples. To unravel the complexity 
							of life on our planet, we must chart the ribbons of 
							interconnections between cells, organisms and ecosystems, 
							past and present.</p>
						<p>A new term for what we study is biocomplexity. We are 
							at the brink of being able to observe complexity at 
							multiple scales across the hierarchy of life. To understand 
							the interlocking systems of our planet is our only 
							hope to sustain them.</p>
						<p>A celebrated astronomer and a member of our National 
							Science Board, Vera Rubin, speaks about the <i>evolution</i> 
							of galaxies--a term we might associate more with the 
							study of life.</p>
						<p>She returns often to her theme of connections. In an 
							interesting cross-fertilization of vocabulary, she 
							speaks of a galaxy as an ecosystem.</p>
						<p>In her view, we should be looking for life on other 
							planets by looking for planets that have a hot molten 
							core. The core generates the Earth's magnetic field, 
							which ultimately gives us the ionosphere that enables 
							and protects life.</p>
						<p><b><a href="rc01radclif/sld027.htm">[galaxy picture]</a></b>

						<p></p>
						<p>The frontiers of science and engineering today seem 
							endless, yet we need the participation and perspectives 
							of all to probe as far as we might in every direction.</p>
						<p>When we consider how to attract women and minorities 
							to science and technology, we begin to reexamine our 
							assumptions about education across the board, from 
							kindergarten to lifelong learning.</p>
						<p>The process to achieving a doctorate today can take 
							twice as long as it did when I worked on my PhD--and 
							the degree-holder now emerges even more specialized 
							than in the past.</p>
						<p>We need to change our thinking about how we educate 
							those who will carry out the research of the future, 
							in a world of science and engineering that is moving 
							toward international networking, collaboration with 
							multiple disciplines, study of complexity, and integration 
							of perspectives.</p>
						<p>I suspect this is a world that could welcome the perspectives 
							of women more warmly than have the cultures of science 
							and engineering of the past, and be the better for 
							it. Thank you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
