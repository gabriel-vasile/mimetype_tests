As primitive as they were, these first electronic machines 
were quite useful in applied science and engineering. Atanasoff 
estimated that it would take eight hours to solve 
a set of equations with eight unknowns using a Marchant 
calculator, 
and 381 hours to solve 29 equations for 29 unknowns. The 
Atanasoff-Berry computer was able to complete the task in under 
an hour. The first problem run on the ENIAC, a numerical simulation 
used in the design 
of the hydrogen bomb, required 20 seconds, as opposed to forty 
hours using mechanical calculators. Eckert and Mauchly later 
developed what was arguably the first commercially successful 
computer, the UNIVAC; in 1952, 45 minutes after the polls 
closed and with 7% of the vote counted, UNIVAC predicted 
Eisenhower would defeat Stevenson with 438 electoral votes 
(he ended up with 442).
