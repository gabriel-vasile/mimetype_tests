<P>Today, the United States leads the world in many of the technologies that
make the information superhighway possible--semiconductors, fiber optics,
high-speed switches, supercomputing, advanced software, etc.  One reason for
this is the billions of dollars that the Federal government, especially the
Defense Department and NASA, have invested in information technology over the
last forty years.  Many of the most important technological breakthroughs in
computing and communications are due in part to a Federal research grant or a
Federal contract.</P>
<P>The very first electronic computer, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/wh-exit.cgi?http://homepage.seas.upenn.edu/~museum">
the ENIAC</A>, was the product of Federal
funding.  There are dozens of similar examples.  A recent study by the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/wh-exit.cgi?http://www.nas.edu/">National Research Council</A> on
the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/wh-exit.cgi?http://www.hpcc.gov/">High-Performance Computing and Communications Program</A>
documented how Federal research and development funding played a key role in the
development of timesharing, computer networking, workstations, computer
graphics, the mouse, the windows interface, VLSI circuit design, RISC computing,
parallel computing, and digital libraries.  </P>
<P>There has been a very effective partnership between government, academia,
and industry.  By providing funding, the Federal government enables academic
researchers to do the kind of long-term research that businesses can't afford to
do.  Even more important, that funding makes possible the training of the next
generation of scientists and engineers.  The research results and the talent
from our universities are then applied by the private sector to develop the new
products and new processes that they need to stay competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>The Internet provides an excellent example of how the Federal government can
work with universities and industry to develop new technologies that can create
whole new industries--and thousands of new, high-paying jobs.  The ARPANET, the
precursor of the Internet, began as a research project funded by the Defense
Department's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/wh-exit.cgi?http://ftp.arpa.mil">Advance Research Project Agency</A>
 in 1969.  The goal was to develop a
robust, computer network that could function after a nuclear attack.  Initially,
the ARPANET linked a few dozen computers at speeds of 56,000 bits per second. 
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the ARPANET expanded as computer science
researchers at universities and laboratories around the country were connected
to the network.  ARPA and other Federal agencies funded the network and the
development of better, faster networking technologies.  In 1986, the National
Science Foundation started the NSFNET program in order to expand the ARPANET and
connect more university researcher to the network.  The network grew in both
size and speed.  By the early 1990s, the NSFNET backbone network was operating
at 45 megabits per second, almost 1,000 times faster than the original ARPANET.
</P>
<P>In the past five years, the NSFNET has evolved into the Internet, a network
of thousands of networks, most funded by the private sector.  Today, thousands
of companies offer Internet services and tens of millions of people around the
globe use the Internet on a daily basis.  According to conservative estimates,
the Internet could be a billion dollar business in just a few years.</P>
<P>There is a similar story for the World Wide Web, one of the most popular
applications of the Internet, which enables users to access a huge variety of
information--both text and imagery--from thousands of sites around the world. 
According to the latest figures, there is a new Web page being created every
four seconds.  The Web was developed at CERN, the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics, in Switzerland.  In 1993, researchers at the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, one of the
supercomputer centers funded by the National Science Foundation, developed an
easy-to-use software package called Mosaic, which made it possible to use the
World Wide Web to view not only text, but images, video, and audio as well.  In
less than a year, there were more than a million copies of Mosaic in use and
Internet usage was sky-rocketing.  This new technology has made possible
companies like Netscape and Spyglass and fundamentally changed the way the
Internet is used.</P>
<P>Funding for the development of Mosaic came from the High-Performance
Computing and Communications Initiative, a Federal R&amp;D program authorized by
the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, which then-Senator Al Gore first
introduced in 1988.  That program provides over 1 billion dollars a year to ten
participating agencies that fund research in universities, Federal laboratories,
and industry.  The HPCC Program has pooled the talent and resources available
throughout the Federal government to ensure effective coordination between
agencies and ensure the efficient use of tax payers' dollars.  In many ways, the
HPCC Program is a model of how government, industry, and academia can work
together to ensure that the U.S. stays at the leading edge of technology.  </P>
