	 <H1>Computers: AVIDAC to Virtual Reality</H1> 
	 <P>Today, Argonne scientists can solve computational
		problems once considered unsolvable. They can "walk into" experiments in a
		computerized virtual reality environment where they can see, hear and
		manipulate information with a mouse-like control wand. The computer's
		development -- as with reactor technology -- was sped by defense needs during
		World War II. ENIAC, containing 18,000 vacuum tubes, was built at the
		University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and was soon used by Argonne researchers to
		solve ballistic trajectory problems. Two years later, the discovery of the
		transistor inaugurated an industrial revolution and made possible construction
		of powerful computers. It was not until 1951, however, that the first
		commercial transistor-driven computer, UNIVAC , was introduced for use in
		business and science. </P>

	 <P>Argonne physicists encountered mathematical problems of enormous
		complexity. In 1949, since there were no computers available commercially, the
		researchers built their own. The laboratory's first electronic digital
		computer, referred to as an "electronic brain," began operation in January
		1953. It was named AVIDAC and was used in reactor engineering and theoretical
		physics research. Several months later, it was followed by ORACLE, a larger
		computer system. Increasingly, almost exponentially, the need for better and
		quicker handling of scientific data grew as the laboratory expanded. Advanced
		computer facilities became a necessity. In 1957, Argonne scientists built
		GEORGE, a large-scale digital computer that operated around the clock. A
		digital IBM-704, then one of the world's largest computers, was installed. The
		next year, PACE (Precision Analog Computing Equipment) was purchased. PACE,
		unlike the digital computers, measured and simulated experimental conditions.
  </P> 
	 <H2>High-Speed Machines</H2> 
	 <P>By the early 1960s, Argonne was one of the biggest computing centers in
		the Midwest. Its high-speed computers were used for design calculations to help
		determine reactor design and for data analysis to interpret experiments by
		measuring physical properties important, for example, in determining the
		effects of small amounts of radiation in the human body. The computers allowed
		physicists, biologists and chemists to compare experimental results and test
		them against the validity of theoretical models. </P>

		was based on upgrades to GEORGE, a large-scale digital computer Argonne built

       </tr>
     </table>
	 <P> Difficulty keeping up with the demand for state-of-the-art computer
		technology led to new and expanded programs. In 1963, construction began on a
		new mathematical and computer facility, staffing in the Applied Mathematics
		division was increased by 50 percent, and one of the world's most advanced
		electronic computers, the CDC 3600, was purchased. In addition, GEORGE got a
		new, and tripled, memory, and other upgrades, including a floating index point
		(FLIP) that let GEORGE automatically handle numbers of widely varying sizes. It
		would later "become" GUS (GEORGE Unified System) as part of the trend toward
		"linking" computers; GUS provided memory for up to seven computers operating at
		the same time. Throughout the decade, Argonne added new computer resources. Of
		particular note was the design and development of a series of computer systems
		called CHLOE, POLLY and ALICE. These systems were capable of analyzed data on
		photographic film and were used in scanning spark chamber data for physics
		research and fingerprint patterns. </P> 
	 <H2>Algorithms and Software</H2> 
	 <P>Software engineering was established as a laboratory discipline during
		the 1970s and 1980s. PACKs, the first truly high-quality collections of
		mathematical software, were designed and implemented under Argonne leadership.
		EISPACK, in particular, set a new standard for reliability, efficiency and
		accuracy. LINPACK, developed shortly thereafter, remains today in great demand
		by industry and the scientific community and is widely used throughout the
		world to evaluate new computer performance. By the early 1980s, Argonne was
		internationally recognized as a world leader, not only in numerical software,
		but in symbolic computation. </P> 
	 <P> Researchers at the laboratory introduced new theorem-proving strategies
		that enabled programs to "reason." Such programs, called "automated reasoning
		programs," today are being used to design circuits, verify computer codes,
		solve puzzles and prove theorems from mathematics and logic. </P> 
	 <H2>Parallel Computing</H2> 
	 <P>Anticipating the growing importance of parallel computing, Argonne
		established the Advanced Computing Research Facility in 1984. For almost a
		decade, the facility supported collaborative research with universities,
		laboratories and industry on a variety of experimental parallel machines
		including hypercubes and a locally developed shared-memory machine nicknamed
		the Lemur. More recently, the laboratory established a High-Performance
		Computing Research Facility featuring a massively parallel IBM Scalable
		POWERparallel SP system. Researchers use the SP for a range of collaborative
		studies from high-energy physics, propulsion, and data imaging to automotive
		research and environmental restoration. To support such research, laboratory
		scientists are developing toolkits for portable parallel programming. Argonne
		computer scientists also spearheaded efforts to promote the use of MPI, a
		standard interface for message passing on distributed-memory, shared-memory,
		and networked computers. MPI permits supercomputer programs to be quickly
		converted for easy use on parallel processing computers. </P>
