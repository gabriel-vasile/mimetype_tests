<P>IT and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have come of age together. In this year that marks the 50th anniversary of NSF, few areas demonstrate as vividly as IT the progress that has been made in science and engineering in the past half-century. </P>

<P>In 1945, the same year that Vannevar Bush outlined his ideas for what became
  the National Science Foundation in <EM>Science-the Endless Frontier</EM>, he also wrote
  an article in the <EM>Atlantic Monthly</EM> that described his vision for capturing and
  accessing information. (See sidebar, "<a href="#think">Excerpts from 'As We
  May Think'.</a>") In the <EM>Atlantic</EM> article, Bush proposed the development of
  a kind of work station, which he called a "memex," that would store and provide
  access to the equivalent of a million volumes of books. The memex would also
  employ a way of linking documents "whereby any item may be caused at will to
  select immediately and automatically another"&#151;allowing the user to build a trail
  between multiple documents. Although Bush proposed using photographic methods
  for storage and mechanical means for retrieval, and the exact technological
  capability he dreamed of has not yet come to pass, the proposed function of
  his memex is remarkably similar to hypertext today. </P>

        <P>Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research
          are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose...The
          difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of
          the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication
          has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of
          the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a
          prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent
          maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the
          days of square-rigged ships.</P>

        <P>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized
          private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random,
          "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all
          his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that
          it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged
          intimate supplement to his memory.</P>

        <P>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance,
          it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top
          are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected
          for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and
          levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.</P>

        <P>In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of
          by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex
          is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted
          5,000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to
          fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.
          It affords an immediate step...to associative indexing, the basic idea
          of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select
          immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature
          of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important
          thing.</P>

        <P>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in
          a code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. </P>

        <P>Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing
          positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces,
          and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user
          taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code
          space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space,
          is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these
          dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.</P>

        <P>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can
          be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding
          code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together
          to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by
          deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It
          is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from
          widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is
          more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.</P>

        <P>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties
          of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish
          bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes
          of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles
          in his memex. </P>

        <P>First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article,
          leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent
          item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many
          items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking
          it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular
          item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available
          materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a
          side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables
          of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his
          own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials
          available to him.</P>

<P>When Bush thought about the capabilities that would be dramatically useful
  to knowledge workers, he envisioned not capable calculators or word processors
  but capabilities to store and access information that current technology is
  just now achieving&#151;using quite different approaches. Much R&amp;D and innovation
  have been necessary to reach these capabilities.</P>

<P>In the same year that Bush's <em>Atlantic</em> article appeared, developments
  were taking place that would provide a different path for achieving his vision.
  At the University of Pennsylvania, John P. Eckert and John W. Mauchly were completing,
  with Army funding, what is commonly recognized as the first successful high-speed
  digital computer&#151;the ENIAC. Dedicated in January 1946 and built at a cost of
  $487,802 (<A href="c9r.htm#moye96">Moye 1996</A>), the ENIAC used 18,000 vacuum tubes, covered 1,800 square
  feet of floor space, and consumed 180,000 watts of electrical power. It was
  programmed by wiring cable connections and setting 3,000 switches. It could
  perform 5,000 operations per second (<A href="c9r.htm#cstb98">CSTB 1998</A>).</P>

<P>Also in 1945, Hungarian-born Princeton mathematician John von Neumann developed
  the stored program concept, which enabled computers to be programmed without
  rewiring. The von Neumann architecture&#151;which refers to a computer with a central
  processing unit that executes instructions sequentially; a slow-to-access storage
  area; and secondary fast-access memory&#151;became the basis for most of the computers
  that followed. Since the middle of the 20th century, software development has
  emerged as a discipline with its own challenges and skill requirements, complementing
  the more visible advances in hardware and enabling great systems complexity.</P>
<P>Over the succeeding 50 years, a vast number of innovations and developments
  occurred. (See sidebar, "<a href="#timeline">IT Timeline.</a>")</P>

<P>Innovations in IT over this period came from a remarkable diversity of sources
  and institutional settings, as well as a remarkable interplay among industry,
  universities, and government. Transistors and integrated circuits were invented
  by industry. Early computers and advances such as core memory, time-sharing,
  artificial intelligence, and Internet browsers were developed in universities,
  primarily with government funding. The World Wide Web was developed at the European
  Center for Particle Research (CERN), a high-energy physics laboratory. The mouse
  and windows were developed at a nonprofit research institute, with government
  funding. High-performance computers were mostly developed in industry with federal
  funds and with the involvement of federal laboratories. The diversity and close
  interaction between these institutions clearly contribute to the vitality of
  innovation in IT. </P>
<P>Innovation in IT has benefited from the support of a diverse set of federal
  agencies&#151;including the Department of Defense (DOD), including the Defense Advanced
  Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the services; NSF; the National Aeronautics
  and Space Administration (NASA); the Department of Energy (DOE); and the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH). Federal support has been particularly important
  in long-range fundamental research in areas such as computer architecture, computer
  graphics, and artificial intelligence, as well as in the development or procurement
  of large systems that advanced the technology&#151;such as ARPANET, the Internet
  (See sidebar "<a href="#internet">Growth of the Internet</a>"), and high-performance
  computers (<A href="c9r.htm#cstb98">CSTB 1998</A>). </P>

<P>The Internet is a meta-network for a variety of subnetworks and applications such as the World Wide Web, bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, e-mail, scientific data exchange, and more. The foundation for the Internet was ARPANET, which started as four computer nodes in 1969. ARPANET was initiated by DARPA and was based on a then-new telecommunications technology called packet switching. ARPANET flourished as a medium for information and data exchange among universities and research laboratories. Moreover, it stimulated the development of TCP/IP, a communications protocol that enabled the interconnection of diverse networks. By the late 1970s, ARPANET comprised hundreds of computer nodes and integrated several separate computer networks, including one based on satellite technology.</P>

<P>The Internet grew out of the ARPANET, which converted to the TCP/IP protocol in 1983. NSF sponsored CSNET and later NSFNET (a high-speed network to link supercomputing centers), which became the backbone for the Internet. NSFNET replaced ARPANET in 1990 and expanded to include a variety of regional networks that linked universities into the backbone network. Many smaller networks linked into NSFNET. By early 1994, commercial networks became widespread, and almost half of all registered users of the network were commercial entities.</P>

<P>Two other events dramatically reshaped the character of the Internet. First, in 1989, scientists at CERN developed the World Wide Web and introduced it in experimental form. Second, in 1993, a team of programmers at NSF's National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois introduced Mosaic, a graphical (hypermedia) browser for exploring the Web. Mosaic was made available on the Internet at no cost, and Web use soared. (See <A HREF="../../c9/fig09-04.htm">figure 9-4</A>.)</P>

<P>NSFNET was fully privatized in 1995, when there were enough commercial Internet service providers, Web browsers, and search engines to sustain the network's operations and management. The Internet continues to evolve. The Next Generation Internet Initiative is developing a higher-speed, more functional telecommunications network. </P>

<P>For more information on the Internet, see Cerf (<A href="c9r.htm#cerf97">1997</A>) and Leiner et al. (<A href="c9r.htm#lein98">1998</A>).</P>

<P>Often there has been complementary work supported by the Federal Government
  and industry. In many cases the Federal Government has supported the initial
  work in technologies that were later developed by the private sector. In other
  cases Federal research expanded on earlier industrial research. Higher-level
  computer languages were developed in industry and moved to universities. IBM
  pioneered relational databases and reduced-instruction-set computing, which
  were further developed with NSF support. Collaboration between industry and
  university researchers has facilitated the commercialization of computing research.

<P>Most of the relentless cost-cutting that has been so important in the expansion
  of IT has been driven by the private sector in response to competitive pressures
  in commercial markets, although here too federal investment&#151;such as in semiconductor
  manufacturing technologies&#151;has played an important role in some areas. </P>
