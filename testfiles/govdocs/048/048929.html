<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><H1>DISCUSSION</H1>

<P>Although a large number of topics emerged from this survey, six major trend
categories circumscribe all of the product-type examples.  These same
categories encompass all of the generic technologies except "infection control"
(which elicited responses too heterogeneous for analysis), and "virtual
reality" (which participants viewed as an educational tool, not a clinical
one).  These trend categories are:</P>

<P><OL>
<LI>Computer-related technology</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>Molecular medicine</LI>
<LI VALUE=2>Home- and self-care</LI>
<LI VALUE=3>Minimally invasive procedures</LI>
<LI VALUE=4>Combination device/drug products</LI>
<LI VALUE=5>Organ replacements and assists</LI>
</OL>


<P>The first two of these trend categories comprise developments grounded in
scientific advances; the second two in growing delivery modalities; and the
last two in specific product-types.</P>

<H2>1. Computer-related Technology</H2>

<P>Computer-related technologies cited in the survey (<A HREF="Table1.gif">Table
1</A>) include computer-aided diagnosis, intelligent devices, biosensors and
robotics (which panelists associated with intelligent devices), and networks of
devices.   ("Telemedicine" and self-diagnosis technologies are discussed under
"Home- and self-care" below.)  </P>

<P>Specific product-types cited by participants as examples of these
technologies (<A HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A>) are integrated patient medical
information systems, patient smart-cards, clinical lab robotics, computer-aided
clinical lab systems, biosensors, and robotic surgery.</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>Current computer systems began with the vacuum tube (1907) which enabled the
first automatic electronic digital computer, the Eniac (1946).  Similarly, the
transistor (1948) enabled the integrated circuit microchip (1959), the
microprocessor comprising an entire computer processor on one chip (1971),  and
the first miniaturized 'personal' computers by Altair (1975) and Apple (1977). 
The resulting applications in the clinical community were administrative
patient data bases (1970s), computerized medical diagnosis programs (ca. 1970), 
and 'computerized' medical devices (1960s and 1970s).  <I>[1], [2], [4],
[7]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P>All of the Table 1 technologies encompassed by this category were judged
likely to experience significant development within the next five (and ten)
years that would result in new products for clinical use.</P>

<P>On a 'systems' level, the survey participants projected very significant
developments regarding  integrated patient medical data bases (including
patient 'smart cards').  The driving forces were described as cost-reduction
pressures, business and financial planning, interest in clinical 'outcomes'
data, and computer support for clinical decision making.  These views are
supported by other analyses in the literature. <I>[1]</I></P>

<P>Participants, however, had divided expectations regarding the future of
computers in clinical decisionmaking. Clinicians' projections were generally
more conservative than engineers'. Similarly, the literature reflects some
moderation evolving among researchers in this field, suggesting a support role
for future computer models rather than the full-fledged automatic consultations
envisioned by some early exponents.  On the other hand, participants did
generally anticipate an increasing trend toward reliance on automated analysis
in the clinical laboratory. <I>[1]</I></P>

<P>An escalating trend toward microprocessor-based intelligent devices was
generally anticipated.  Commonly cited examples were cardiac and drug-delivery
implants, as well as 'smart' robotics used in minimally invasive surgery. The
accelerating prospects for such medical devices are ultimately grounded in the
doubling of  microprocessor power approximately every 18 months in accordance
with "Moore's Law".  The chip technology described by "Moore's Law" will
probably continue to grow in this exponential manner for at least another
decade, after which limitations may arise due to quantum effects.  The growth
of intelligent devices is likely to mirror that growth in microprocessor
technology.</P>

<P>Survey participants also anticipated miniaturized biochemical and optical
biosensors in these intelligent devices, sometimes in integrated "sensor
fusion" configurations.  The literature, too, reflects a substantial research
interest in bioanalytic, electrochemical, and optical sensors in intelligent
biomedical applications.  ("Robotics" are discussed under "Minimally Invasive
Procedures" below.) <I>[1]</I></P>

<P>Finally, some participants noted the potential for microprocessor-based
intelligence to promote a trend toward customizing device performance to the
needs of individuals and of specialized patient groups with common clinical
characteristics.</P>

<H2>2. Molecular Medicine</H2>

<P>The technologies (<A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A>) cited in the survey under
this category are genetic diagnostics, genetic therapy, and tissue-engineered
devices. Except for tissue-engineered devices (discussed chiefly under "Organ
Substitutes" below), the only specific medical-device example of those
technologies in <A HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A> is biosensors.</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>Current developments in genetics were anticipated in a number of
developments including Nobel prize-winning research on the role of chromosomes
in heredity (1933), and on the structure of DNA (1953).  Seminal landmarks
include the development of amniocentesis to detect genetic disorders (1952),
the demonstration that eukaryotic DNA fragments could be inserted into
bacterial cells and reproduced (1973), the development of hybridoma technology
to produce unlimited quantities of monoclonal antibodies (1975),  the use of
antisense DNA to modulate gene expression (1978), the initiation of the Human
Genome Project (1986), the discovery of a gene associated with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (1986),  the development of automated DNA sequencing methods
combining fluorescence-based enzyme techniques with laser instrumentation and
programmable pipetting robots (1990s), and the first published account of
successful gene therapy for a cholesterol-related disorder (1994). <I>[1], [4],
[5], [7]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P>In scoring the technologies, participants expected significant developments
leading to clinical applications in both genetic diagnosis and
tissue-engineered devices over the next five to ten years.  This expectation
clearly derives from the ongoing Human Genome Project which has targetted the
goal of sequencing the 3,000,000,000 monomers comprising the 80,000 genes  in
the human genome by 2005.  Participants were much more guarded about the
prospects for clinical delivery of genetic therapy even over a ten year period,
however.  </P>

<P>For genetic diagnosis, participants' interviews projected accelerating
growth especially for single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis. The
primary medical hardware cited was the DNA microchip sensor device.<I> [1]
</I></P>

<P>Genetic therapy elicited somewhat less optimism in interviews and group
discussions.  With over 4000 known human genetic diseases, participants did
expect an intense interest in this field during the next decade, but most
believed the likelihood of a major clinical impact during that period to be
only moderate. Some participants noted the potential for in vivo delivery of
tissue-engineered genetic therapies through implantion of sequestered
tissue-engineered cells in encapsulated form.  Investigation of such
polymer-cell implants is discussed in the literature, as well.<I> [1]</I></P>

<P>Cancer was cited by participants as a likely focus of both diagnostic and
therapeutic genetic techniques, partly because of the large patient population. 
The literature, too, reflects research interest in genetic techniques such as
tumor vaccines, "suicide" genes, and tumor suppressor genes to treat diseases
including certain leukemias, brain tumors, carcinomas, melanomas, and
retinoblastomas.<I> [1]</I> </P>

<H2>3. Home- and Self-Care</H2>

<P>Generic technology areas (from <A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A>) included in
this trend are home/self monitoring and diagnosis, home/self therapy, and
telemedicine. Specific product examples (<A HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A>)
encompassed by this category are home diagnostics and telemedicine for patients
in the home.</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>This trend encompasses such milestones as the introduction of home dialysis
(1964) and a broad variety of other devices. More fundamental, though, is the
fact that nearly all U.S. health care was performed at home by nonprofessionals
until around 1900.  Before then most medical care was provided at home by
relatives and neighbors;  physicians played a small role in the care of the
average patient.  Indeed, until state licensing boards appeared in the 1880's
anybody could call him or herself a 'doctor' in the U.S.  It was also not until
around 1900 that hospitals began to grow into their modern form, due to the
emerging need for specialized facilities to house antiseptic surgical suites
with anesthetic equipment, and the unique requirements of the new field of
radiology.  Today, home- and self-care are re-emerging in response to
cost-containment pressures resulting both from the explosive growth of medical
science since 1950, and from Medicare and Medicaid funding legislation in 1965. 
This return to decentralized care is being catalyzed by the emergence of the
Internet as an unprecedented conduit of health information to patients, and by
the diffusion of inexpensive computer technology as an aid to medical
decisionmaking by individual consumers.  <I>[1], [5]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P>Participants' scores indicate their expectation for significant developments
leading to new products in each of the technologies in this category in both
five- and ten-year intervals.  </P>

<P>During discussions, participants generally envisioned this trend as
important but unlikely to produce significant technical advances.  It was
perceived to be driven by considerations of cost and, to a lesser extent,
convenience.  The types of home diagnostics commonly envisioned were tests
involving urine and blood chemistry, as well as drug concentrations --
particularly for elderly patients.  Improved monitoring of glucose levels for
diabetics was frequently mentioned.  The most common form of home therapy cited
was drug administration using simplified delivery techniques.  Some
participants noted the prospect of using home-based intelligent devices to
modulate therapies and to "coach" patients.  Several participants noted the
possible use of relatively simple forms of telemedicine for home care,
especially within the confines of a local or regional medical system. 
Interestingly, participants anticipated greater significance for this
"low-technology" telemedicine application than for some other other "high-end"
versions, perhaps because of potential interstate jurisdictional difficulties
during the time period addressed by this study.</P>

<H2>4. Minimally Invasive Procedures</H2>

<P>Technology groups (<A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A>) related to this
category include minimally invasive devices, medical imaging, microminiaturized
devices, laser diagnosis and therapy, robotic surgical devices and
non-implanted sensory aids.  The specific examples (from <A
HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A>) cited by participants were minimally invasive
cardiovascular and neurosurgery, laser surgery, robotic surgery,
nanotechnology, endoscopy, functional and multimodality imaging, MRI, PET, and
image contrast agents.</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>The invention of the stethoscope (1816) began a landmark change from
diagnostic reliance on surface observations and patient reports to collecting
data on internal events using nontraumatic methods.  It was followed by such
devices as ophthalmoscopes (1850), clinical thermometers (ca. 1850),
sphygmomanometers (1896), ECG devices (1901), and EEG instruments (1929). 
<I>[1], [2], [5]</I></P>

<P>Noninvasive radiologic imaging began immediately after the discovery of
x-rays (1895), and eventually included PET (1951),  ultrasonography (1968), CT
(1971), and MRI (early 1980s).  <I>[1], [2], [7]</I></P>

<P>The early examples of modern optical endoscopy were laryngoscopes (1857),
scopes for the rectum and vagina (1860s), cystocopes for the urinary bladder
(1877), and arthrocopes (1918).   Development of fiber optic imaging bundles
(1950s) made possible the first really flexible endoscopes and revolutionized
endoscopy, including a host of emerging therapeutic techniques (1950s) which
would eventually include laparoscopic appendectomies, herniotomies,
cholecystectomies and hysterectomies.  After the invention of the laser (1960) 
and its introduction as a revolutionary surgical tool (1962), those optic fiber
developments transformed its use, as well.  <I>[2], [5], [7], [8]</I></P>

<P>Early developments in minimally invasive cardiac surgery included the
cardiac catheter (1929),  the intra-aortic balloon pump (1961), and balloon
angioplasty (1968). Landmarks in laparoscopic surgery include the first
laparoscopic appendectomy (1983) and the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy
(1987).  <I> [1], [4], [5], [6], [7]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P><A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A> reflects the survey participants' strong
view that every technology in this category will experience significant new
developments during the next five and ten year periods leading to new clinical
products, with two exceptions.  Substantial developments were anticipated for
microminiaturized devices, but only on a ten-year time scale. For nonimplanted
sensory devices, participants generally envisioned only a modest chance for
major innovations throughout the next decade (except for the specific example
of hearing aids).</P>

<P>In interviews and group discussions, survey participants expressed an
expectation of continuing  advancements in endoscopic procedures including
fiber optic laser surgery and optical diagnosis, smart miniaturized robotic
devices, and a range of miniaturized devices.  Clinically, most participants
expected an emphasis on minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery and minimally
invasive neurosurgery.</P>

<P>While increasing miniaturization of components was broadly anticipated,
nanotechnology was seen as a separate issue.  Although some participants
believed nanotechnology might eventually alter the clinical landscape
profoundly, views were divided on the likelihood of signficant developments
over the ten year period covered by this survey.</P>

<P>Participants also predicted continuing advances in noninvasive medical
imaging, including a trend to image-guided procedures.  The most pronounced
expectations were for developments in functional and multimodality imaging.</P>

<P>Finally, some participants observed that longer term trends might ultimately
lead to non-invasive technologies.  Such technologies would seek to direct
energy (not material devices) transdermally to internal body structures for
therapeutic interventions.  Existing techniques that may point toward such
future developments include ultrasonic lithotripsy and gamma knife
technology.</P>

<H2>5. Combination Device/Drug Products</H2>

<P><A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A> includes a single technology area in this
category -- device/drug/biological products.  Two specific examples were cited
by participants and included in <A HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A>.  These are
implanted drug delivery systems (whose primary function is drug delivery) and
drug impregnated devices (in which drug delivery is an adjunct to the device
function).</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>The history of this category includes a variety of product-types, dating at
least from the perfection of the hypodermic needle (1855).  There are many
modern examples of implanted delivery systems, such as the insulin pump (1980).
One fundamental driving force for delivery systems has been the growth of new
pharmaceutical products, especially since the dramatic expansion of drug
research after 1945. That research has led to the synthesis and testing of
millions of compounds for pharmacological and antimicrobial properties. Indeed,
today much of that development is performed in automated computer-controlled
systems, leading to an even greater acceleration of the process.<I> [1],
[5]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P><A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A> shows that participants anticipated a
strong likelihood of developments in this category over both five- and ten-year
periods leading to new clinical products.</P>

<P>In the interviews, several survey participants characterized this as an very
important area having major importance to a large group of patients. 
Generally, participants expected three types of  developments.  First, they
anticipated development of new products designed for implanted delivery of
insulin and other drugs.  They pointed toward new implanted pumps, possibly
intelligent devices with improved biosensors to monitor concentrations in body
fluids and make dynamic adjustments in delivery rates.  They also suggested the
likely development of new polymeric timed-release devices which could improve
the delivery of long-acting pharmaceuticals at optimized locations and
rates.</P>

<P>Second, participants projected new developments in drug-impregnated devices. 
Examples included new types of cardiac implants with antithrombogenic drugs, as
well as orthopedic implants with bacteriostatic coatings.</P>

<P>Finally, survey participants expected new developments in drug delivery
systems to simplify reliable use by unsophisiticated patients in home settings,
including the growing elderly population.  Examples included nasal and
inhalation products.</P>

<H2>6. Organ Substitutes and Assists</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A> technologies subsumed under this
category are artificial organs, tissue engineered organs, and electrical
stimulation.  Specific product examples (<A HREF="Table2.gif">Table 2</A>)
include bone, heart valves, heart pumps, cartilage, pancreas, blood vessels,
kidney, skin, liver, eye, and regenerated nerve cells.  Also included in the
examples were cardiac, neural and neuromuscular stimulation.</P>

<H3>Historical background</H3>

<P>There were few significant replacement or assistive devices before 1950
other than wooden legs, corrective glasses, dental prostheses, and (relatively
unsuccessful) attempts to stabilize bone fractures with metallic implants. The
few exceptions included the Drinker respirator, or "iron lung" (1927), and the
first artificial kidney (1944).  Even the latter was developed into a practical
device only later for chronic use in a hospital setting (1959) and, later
still, for home use (1964).<I> [1], [4], [5], [7]</I></P>

<P>Artificial replacement implants largely began with the same development that
enabled an explosion of donor-organ transplants --  the cardiopulmonary bypass
unit (1951).   This device, together with heparin and hypothermic surgical
techniques, opened the way for donor-organ transplants of the kidney (1954),
liver (1963),  and heart (1967),  and eventually even the intestines &amp;
pancreas (1990s). <I> [1], [2], [4], [5]</I></P>

<P>Important early replacement and assistive devices included mechanical heart
valves (1952) synthetic arterial grafts (1957), implantable pacemakers (1959),
cemented total artificial hips (1960), pulsatile ventricular assist devices
(1963), xenograft bioprosthetic heart valves (1965), and artificial hearts
(1969).  The development of many of these replacement and assistive devices has
been motivated mainly by the severe shortage of natural donor organs.  It has
been estimated that each year at least 2 million U.S. patients receive
artificial body parts while only 20,000 donor organs are available for
transplant. <I>[1], [5], [7]</I></P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P><A HREF="Table1.gif">Table 1</A> indicates that survey participants expected
electrical stimulation technologies to continue to yield new developments in
cardiac, neural, and neuromuscular applications leading to new clinical
products over the next five to ten years.  Significant new developments were
also deemed likely for artificial (i.e., hardware) and tissue-engineered organs
but only over the longer ten-year period.</P>

<P>Many future developments will be driven by the continuing dearth of natural
donor organs.  For the 260,000 potential liver transplant candidates in the
U.S. approximately 3,500 receive liver transplants annually, and 25,000 liver
patients die each year.  About 10,000 renal transplants occur each year in the
U.S. for a dialysis population exceeding 200,000, while approximately 40,000
kidney patients die.  Many of these patients are transplant candidates.
<I>[1]</I></P>

<P>Survey participants projected a variety of specific products in this
category, although most of these products would replace only a few of the most
critical functions of the target organ.  Some products were envisioned as 
primarily hardware-based devices such as the electrical stimulation devices,
miniaturized assistive heart pumps, and portable hemodialysis units. Others
were primarily tissue-derived products including cartilage and blood vessels,
as well as improved bioprosthetic heart valves.  </P>

<P>Many of the predicted examples, however, were hybrid hardware-tissue
products including implantable bone and pancreas, and, eventually, kidney and
heart valve replacements.  Participant predictions and the scientific
literature both reflect research on these devices using implanted filters,
polymer-tissue composites, polymer- or hydrogel encapsulated cells, and
cell-seeded synthetic scaffolds or hollow fibers with and without additional
enzymes or pharmacological agents.  Several participants predicted that such
hybrid products were likely to play a dominant role in this category over the
next decade.</P>

<P>Finally, participants identified three applications which they deemed
important, but not likely to generate developments leading to new clinical
products in the next decade.  They were electronic ocular prosthetics,
artificial livers, and nerve regeneration products.  The latter two areas were
envisioned as hybrid hardware-tissue devices.</P>

<P>This category poses especially difficult challenges in predicting the timing
of new developments.  Experience suggests that the difficulties entailed in
developing artificial organs are often underestimated.  These difficulties
include the effort and the technical advances needed to pass from a 'proof of
principle' prototype for animal evaluation to fabrication of a clinically
acceptable system for human use.  Among the bottlenecks frequently cited are
full-scale design, cell procurement, cell survival, and device storage.<I> 
[1]</I></P>

<H2>Discussion Summary</H2>

<P>In aggregate, these projections support a vision of the next decade with
four discernible characteristics.  First, medical hardware seems certain to
become smarter.  Devices and systems are likely to reflect a more sophisticated
capability for intelligent behavior, and more mature information data bases to
guide product performance.  Second, smarter and simpler products will
facilitate a growing trend to decentralization of care.  Technology will
support the cost- and convenience-driven diffusion of health care from the
clinic to the home.  Third, product development will increasingly blur the
boundaries between biological systems on the one hand, and physical and
engineering designs on the other.  Integrated and hybrid approaches will play
an expanding role.  Fourth, technological developments will help to catalyze a
trend toward greater precision in clinical interventions, both spatially and
temporally.  Reductions in invasiveness will probably mirror advances in
miniaturization and improvements in early diagnosis.</P>
