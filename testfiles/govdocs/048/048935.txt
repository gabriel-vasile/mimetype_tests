ABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER
=======================
The New Book Bulletin gives you short reviews of noteworthy new books 
we have received in our stores.

Titles are selected for review from the hundreds of new computer and 
electronics books published every month. Our staff and customers 
identify titles worth reviewing.

The reviews are written by our staff--they are real reviews, not 
advertising fluff. We try to help you make sense of the avalanche of 
computer books cascading off the presses.  Which ones are useful for 
you? How do different books compare on a topic?

The Bulletin helps you find out.

We'll be glad to send you a free subscription to the New Book Bulletin, 
and a complimentary subscription for a friend or co-worker. Just phone, 
fax or e-mail your mailing address to the numbers at the bottom of this 
page.

Four  Stores to Serve You
=====================

San Jose store: (408) 435-1118
Sunnyvale store: (408) 730-9955
Cupertino store (408) 973-9955
DC area store (703) 734-7771

======================================================
Our Newest Store: Largest Computer Book Store on East Coast
======================================================

In fact, our new Washington D.C.-area store will offer the 
largest selection of computer books anyplace east of Silicon 
Valley!

The new store is set to open its doors unofficially sometime 
in July, with an official large-scale grand opening in 
September.

It will be the second-largest computer book store in the 
world, almost as big as our famous flagship store in San Jose.

The new Computer Literacy Bookshop is in Tysons 
Corner, Virginia, minutes from D.C., near two shopping malls. 
For easy access, our Tysons Corner store is close to major 
thoroughfares, with free parking.

On the shelves, you' ll find thousands of different titles on 
computing, electronics, high-tech management and related 
topics.

We carry a far greater selection than other stores because 
we deal with more than 1,000 different publishers. We stock 
many titles carried by no other bookstore in the world. And we 
are often the first store to offer the newest titles.

Besides the best selection of books, you will find something 
more in Tysons Corner: knowledgeable staff. We hire people 
with technical backgrounds, so when you ask a technical 
question, you don' t get glassy-eyed stares--you get answers.
Our people know computer books, so they can help you find 
the book you need. (All the reviews in this New Book Bulletin 
were written by our staff.)

See the map above for the address and phone number. We 
look forward to seeing you there!

Computer Trivia Crossword Puzzle Answers
====================================

To help celebrate Computer Literacy Bookshops'  
10th birthday this year, we conducted the 
World' s Toughest Computer Trivia Contest Crossword Puzzle.

Your responses were very entertaining. We got phone calls. We 
got e-mail. We got letters.

Some people thanked us for the fun. Some people wanted 
hints. Some people wanted to argue.

One man wrote, " Your list of definitions contains at least one 
mistake. In 4 Horizontal, San Jose has no Jobs Street and no 
Wozniak Street, and neither of those names has the required 
six letters. But Saratoga (not San Jose) has a Scully Avenue; 
this fits the space, but John Scully is by no means a cofounder 
of Apple."

We appreciate his hard work, but our answer is correct. We 
stand by all of them, with the possible exception of one 
hyphen. (See notes.)

Now we are pleased to announce the winners.

The first place winner is Gary Tom of Tandem Computers, 
Cupertino, CA. Mr. Tom scored an impressive 43.5 answers 
right out of a possible 49. (For that half point, see the answer to 
40 Horizontal.)

Close behind in second place with 41 correct answers is K. 
Vivekanand Rau of Sunnyvale, CA.

Our third place winner lives in Sterling, Virginia: Rusty 
Allen, who got 38.5 right.
Contratulations to you all!

DIAGONAL
1 First large-scale digital computer: ENIAC;  Everybody got this 
right.
2 First commercial computer: UNIVAC;this, too.
3 Name of slab in 2001: TYCHO MAGNETIC  ANOMALY-1; 
There was minor controversy.
 Should a hyphen or a space go before the '1' ?  Our puzzle may 
be in error here. 
6 Chip pioneer used to have Von in name: The  electronics giant 
founded in the 1800s by  inventor and scientist Von SEIMENS.
12 Backups go here: OFFSITE, of course.  Slightly less than half 
of you got this right. 
13 Invented Ethernet: Robert METCALFE  invented it exactly 
20 years ago.
16 Most efficient cables are made of this:  GLASS.
18 Some cache memories do this to eliminate
  inconsistencies between main and cache
  memory: Our toughest question--NOBODY  answered 
SNARF, which some ISA cache  subsystems do by capturing 
data from the  system bus while the bus master writes it to  
main memory. 
19 Only building you see as you drive into IBM
  HQ in Armonk: GUARD BOOTH.
21 Changing height to convey data: Okay, we  know the N.Y. 
Times doesn' t allow 2-letter  words.  We did, and were 
complimented by  entrants on this tricky definition of 
amplitude  modulation, or AM.
29 Only company besides IBM & Microsoft with
  source code for MS-DOS, OS/2 & Windows:  A tough one. Only 
the first-place winner knew  about CITRIX.
33 Planned scam: RUSE.
42 Middle of Gates'  first compiler: To get this,  you had to know 
two facts.  The first compiler  Bill Gates sold was BASIC, and 
the " S" in  BASIC stands for SYMBOLIC.
43 Intel CEO' s real name: We thought this would  be easy, but 
it turned out to be the question  that separated the top of the 
heap from  everyone else. Our top two winners got this  right 
and no one else did. Andrew Grove first  came to the U.S. with 
$20 in his pocket and  his Hungarian name, Andras GROF.
45 A bit: BINARY DIGIT.

HORIZONTAL
4 SJ street named for Apple cofounder: WOZ WAY, to recognize 
Mr. Wozniak' s philanthropy.
8 State with most UNIX users: Everyone got CA.
9 BITnet' s bit: Our most controversial answer.  We got letters, 
e-mail, and phone calls  insisting that the BIT in BITnet 
stands for  " Because Its Time". Maybe, but some books  say 
BECAUSE ITS THERE, so we stand by  our answer.
10 Company that invented laser printer: Our  research couldn' 
t find this name. Someone  suggested we call legendary author 
and  computing pioneer Donald Knuth. He knew. It  was 
invented in 1960, and first written up in  the Penrose Annual 
for 61-62, which was so  amazed that it bound into each book a 
sample  sheet from the British RANK XEROX.
15 Developed first desktop word processing,   screens with 
windows, groupware; holds
  patent on mouse: Douglas ENGELBART
17 May have some letters: AN for alphanumeric.
20 Part of software which credits everyone who
  built it (2 words): GANG SCREEN.
23 Venture capitalist Perkins worked for this co.:  HEWLETT-
PACKARD.
25 Company that invented pixel phasing: An  honorable 
mention to Bruce D. Lofland of  Lenexa, Kansas, the only 
person who  answered MEGATECH of San Diego.
26 Went from primary contractor to primaries: H.  Ross 
PEROT, of course.
27 Made many minis in Maynard: DEC founder  Ken OLSEN.
28 Not sawtooths: Smooth waves are SINES.
32 First computer with off-the-shelf client/server   OS: 
TANDEM NONSTOP.
34 Designer of Colossus mainframe: FORBIN
38 Non-printing character that stops a function:  CONTROL 
character.
39 Computing' s biggest dad and son: The  WATSONS of IBM.
40 Im: This is the standard abbreviation for  IMAGINARY PART 
OF. No one got it all, but  we gave a half-point credit for any 
answer  with the word IMAGINARY in it.
41 Now-big company started in dorm room   instead of garage: 
DELL Computers.
44 Earthly attraction amount: 1G.
46 Transmit signals to satellites at will: ALOHA.

VERTICAL
5 Another consortium: ACE.
7 Laser printer parts that fuse toner to paper:  FIXING 
ROLLERS. Less than half got this.
11 Father of supercomputing: Seymour CRAY.
14 Co-developed first commercial computer:  John 
MAUCHLEY
15 The other co-developer: J. Presper ECKERT.
22 MS-DOS warm boot command: A trick, but  half of you got it 
right: THERE IS NONE.
24 First desktop publishing service bureau: Only  our first-
place winner correctly named  TECHART of San Francisco.
30 Makes connections bigger than LANs: Wide- area nets from 
Ungermann-Bass, UB.
31 It threatened Enterprise: Only one-third of  you watch 
enough Star Trek to know the  evil computer NOMAD.
34 Guards one part of a net or program from
  another' s damage: FIREWALL.
35 Found first bug: Everybody except one  person knew it was 
Grace HOPPER. He  should be properly embarrassed.
36 Link devices sequentially: DAISYCHAIN.
37 Non-linear optical: NOL.
46 And no substance (2 words): ALL STYLE.

perspective. Covers topics from architecture/system concepts
