Subject: PVM survey

Dear Colleague,
In order to improve PVM we are trying to understand how
people are using the system. Your feedback is important.
Could you take a moment to answer three questions.

Are you using PVM today?

What are your application(s)?

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
Please email the information to pvm-survey@cs.utk.edu.

Your help is much appreciated.

Best wishes,
The PVM Project Team

1. Are you using PVM today?
Yes

2. What are your application(s)?
Computational Fluid Dynamics, i.e.
3D-spherical high resolution modeling
of convection in the earth's mantle

3.How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
a) heterogenous cluster (2 SUN,1 HP,1 SGI, 1 DEC-ALPHA)
b) homogenous clusters(16 node IBM, 8 node HP, 8 node DEC-ALPHA)
c) massively parallel machines (Cray T3D, IBM SP2)

---------------------
comments and suggestions:
1) I would like to see a spawning routine, that can take 
double precision input. This is useful, since I compile
my codes with double prec compiler flags and always have
problems when spawning my tasks.

2) I would like to see the number of pvm-routines kept limited. ;-)

3) My overall evaluation and experience with PVM ( I have
been using it for 2.5 years ) is extremely positive. Setting 
the defacto standard for message passing and encouraging 
network computing is one of the most helpful developments
in computational physics right now.

 >Are you using PVM today?
   I am running PVM as I answer this message. The job is
   running over the network using 8 RS6K machines and
   2 SUN4 machines. The largest number of machines
   I've run on the network together is 40. These were
   a mixture of SGI's, SUN's, and IBM's. I generally
   run from 10 to 20 processors using PVM. Right now
   the code I'm most interested in running has some
   problem on the SGI's which is why they are not part
   of my current virtual machine.

 >What are your application(s)?
   My applications are seismic processing programs. Right
   now I'm processing data from the North Sea to image
   a gas field at a depth of 3.5 Km. The image will be
   used to decide the extent of the field.

 - On shared memory multiprocessor machines it would be
   useful to be able to define a memory buffer which
   all the processors could access. For example if you
   are modeling waves traveling through a medium such
   as the earth it is inconvenient to have to keep a copy
   of the medium paramteres (velocity, density, etc.) in
   memory for each processor when they all share memory
   and could read these parameters from the same place.

Dear PVM:

	This a reply to your survey request.  We are
a group with offices throughout the Health Center of
the University of Pittsburgh including offices in

5 hospitals, the School of Engineering, and the medical
school.

	(1) Yes we are using PVM today and every day.

	(2) We are running one application at this time.
It is conceptually a client/server application.  The servers
provide access to files which contain neurophysiological
data from surgical patients being monitored in the operating
room.  Data is collected continuously, processed, and then
saved to the file about every 40 seconds.  Each time new data
appears in a file.  Any observer process (client) connected
to the virtual machine can access the data through the local
server process running on the machine on which the data is being
acquired.

The client processes run constantly, whether
they are in use or not.  The data acquisition equipment includes
a workstation mounted in a wheeled instrumentation cart.  When
a case is scheduled, a cart is wheeled into the operating room,
attached to the Ethernet running through the hospitals, and booted.
A script running on the base node (the node where PVM was started)
detects the booting node and spawns a pvmd and a server process on it.
  Using this approach we routinely run the same virtual machine
for many weeks at a time between halts.
	    This application using PVM primarily for its message
passing and dynamic group capabilities.  The dynamic grouping is
used to provide several fault tolerance measures.  We are currently
developing two computational applications which will utilize the
same client/server architectural approach.  Because our machines
are constantly in use but produce mostly spare cycles, we hope
to use perhaps 20% - 50% of those cycles with PVM applications.
Both applications involve identification and display of time varying
data.  The simpler one will be used in the operating room to reduce
the time required to provide feedback to the surgeon from 30-40 seconds
to 5-10 seconds.  The second is an image processing application which
will be developed on our network and then ported to a network with
higher communication bandwidth, perhaps the ALPHA cluster at the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

	(3) Our virtual machine includes 30 - 40 HP9000/700 RISC
workstations and an SGI Personal IRIS.  Several of the HP boxes are
off site: Mount Sinai Hospital (New York City), George Washington
University Hospital (Washington, D.C.), and the offices of Computational
Diagnostics Inc., a local private practice firm which provides
intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in several community
hospitals in the Pittsburgh area.  We also have a network of HP/Apollo
MC68040 workstations running the AEGIS operating system which are used
in the operating room.  We are seeking a PVM port for this operating
system.

	COMMENTS and SUGGESTIONS:  We are extremely pleased with PVM
and wish to express our gratitude to the developers and the government
agencies which support their work.  We have had very little trouble and
have been able to generate production software for use in our large
clinical service is 2 man months based on PVM.
	We are of course highly concerned with fault tolerance, as our
applications are time critical and can be life critical.  For the future
we would like to have a fault tolerant version of PVM, one which has the
which in
particular is tolerant to failure of any node in the virtual machine,
particularly the base node, i.e. the first one on which PVM is started.
Local caching of the virtual machine configuration at every pvmd along
with the planned static group function would make the package far more
robust in the face of base node failure as well as network segmentation.
It would also be helpful, although I suspect very difficult, to provide
a mechanism whereby two independent virtual machines could be merged into
one without having to halt one of them.
	Another improvement would be a threaded version of PVM.
	Finally, for optimization purposes, it might be worthwhile
to have a receive-in-place function (there is already send-in-place)
rather than having to unpack at the reading end.

Thank you again.

Dear PVM:

	Please add the following to the paragraph in our survey
response in which we discuss the life critical nature of our work.

:

We have been careful to construct the software so that life critical
 no potentially
critical function depends exclusively on PVM, but only of the software

running on the local workstation in the operating room.

  We would like to use PVM on our low frequency CEM code CARLOS.
  It was used to win the Gorden Bell award this last year and is
  used by the EMCC (Electromagnetic Code Consortium).  We just 
  can't find an out-of-core LINPACK/LAPACK that works with PVM.
  Any suggestions? Does one exist?

  My only frustration during installation... pvm3/lib/pvm claims it
  will set PVM_ROOT to default to ~pvm3.  A minor adjustment makes
  this work.  I also stick the #!/bin/ksh at the top.  The tilda does
  not work in the Bourne shell.

  My only frustration during use... Many times a host will be okay
  and the network will go away for just few minutes.  It is unfortunate
  that a few minutes later the host is decleared dead and everything
  hangs.  It would be nice such that even if the computer is declared
  dead, if it could come back to life and reattach to the virutal machine
  where it left off.

   Please, disregard previous e-mail if you received it.

   Yes, I use PVM now on a routine manner.

   My application is " Aerodynamic Inverse Design and Analysis for a Full
   Engine".
   I use PVM to run this application on two CRAY C90s. My host is an IBM
   RS6K-590.
   I use PVMe on an IBM SP2-160 nodes at NASA Ames. After a problematic
   installation of PVMe on the SP2 ( it was creating a lot of orphan jobs)
   now runs excellently.

   The use on the C90s is rather interactive, whereby I spwan processes
   from my RS6K host on either C90 as needed. Mostly, this processes run
   almost independently of each other and with practicly no limit on the
   number of processes that I am running. ( Among other things PVM has
   resulted to be an excellent scheduler).

   On the SP2 I run parallel jobs that require large internode
   comunications. SP2 runs those jobs on dedicated time. The internode
   comunication overhead I fund to be very reasonable for the problem
   I am solving.



       Congratulations for an excellent piece of work.



       I can expand, or send you some results on the SP2 if you are

    interested.

I frequently have to run demonstrations on experimental
network and hardware configurations. My team 
has been actively developing distributed processing 
applications using PVM for over a year and the most difficulty
we have had associated with PVM is getting it to start-up
properly on the distributed architecture under the
experimental network. Since I am required to develop software
for use by researchers who aren't very familiar (or patient)
with distributed processing what we could really use are
good tools for diagnosing PVM start-up problems.

Daemons die when NFS at maui goes down. This creates problems
as the NFS ons the SP-2 seems to be somewhat unstable.
The result is the program dies (with Signal 15).

	I am using an application developed by the Department of 
	Energy (Sandia National Labs).  The application is called 
	PCTH.  It is a eulerian hydrocode we use to model shock 
	physics and impact dynamics problems.  

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

	The only kind of machine has been Hewlett Packard 700 series
	workstations.  The number of machines varies from 4 to 8.

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

	Let me start with my compliments.  PVM so far as been a 
	solid package that installed with ease.  The only problem 
	I had was in compiling the example problem "xep".  I did 
	not have some of the include files (Toggle.h, Form.h etc.)

	Though, in all honesty, I did not spend a great deal of time 
	on it.  

	My main concern with PVM is it's continued funding.  I am 
	now at a point in planning future hardware purchases where 
	I have to decide whether to pursue a low-end massively 
	parallel machine "OR" continue to accumulate workstations.  
	My budget does not allow for both.  Much of the software 
	I have been seeing that does my kind of problems, is 
	developed on MP machines like the Intel Paragon.  If the 
	software isn't ported to PVM, I've got a problem.  Further, 
	I'm not a big enough player to force these software  
	developers to make the ports.  I have spoken to my hardware 
	vendors (HP, Digital).  My sales reps are not familiar with 
	PVM; which is disturbing.  I guess you could summarize this 
	as a technology transfer concern.  

	For now, PVM is the way for me to run problems to big to 
	fit on one machine.

Subject: Re: PVM survey

        Following are the answeres to your questions :

        1. Currently, we are not using PVM.  I used it to implement a Branch-and
            Bound algorithm for learning purposes. However, we are excited about
             PVM and whenever the opportunity arises, we shall use it.

        2.  Most of applications are large-scale mixed integer programming
            problems.
            For example, Airlines Fleet-Planning, Truck dispatching etc.

        3.  At present we have two RISC/6000-580 machines hooked together.

            So far, I have a very limited experience with PVM to really offer
            you any significant suggestion.  
            However, thanks for PVM its a great tool.

	Currently, we only got 9 workstations and mainframe to run PVM.
	Those include 3 HP, 1 Sun, 1 SGI, 1 Dec, 1 Dec-Alpha, and 2 Cray.
	After we can understand the PVM totally, we will install it over our

The code runs on the nCUBE 2 and on the T3D.  The orginal
parallelization was carried out on an nCUBE 2 since our university owns
one, and we have unlimited access to it at no charge. The message
passing was based on the nCUBE's native message passing library. We
ported the code to the T3D and decided to base the message passing on
PVM. Our code is not 100% portable since we rely on Cray call
(fast_send and fast_receive) to bypass the slow PVM calls.

No problem.

> Are you using PVM today?

Yes.  In fact, as I type this I am.

> What are your application(s)?

Personally, I have used PVM for the following applications.

 1) Molecular Dynamics - As part of an NSF "Grand Challenge" Grant,
    we have used PVM to implement various multipole algorithms
    for solving large N-body interaction problems.  The resulting
    libraries have been succesfully integrated into the NAMD
    Moleculer Dynamics package from UIUC (which also runs under PVM)
    Hopefully, in the new few months, we will have the XPLOR MD
    package from Yale use these codes.

 2) As part of my Masters research, I implemented distrributed codes to
    identify numerical sequences known as Golomb Rulers.  This search 
    could be likened to a prime number search.  I implemented a fault
    tolerant, restartable parallel code which ran for over three months
    on a network of 27 workstations and discoversd a new unknown sequence.

 3) A proof-of-concept project implementing Active Messages under
    PVM using Unix signals.

In addition to my own work, I support the installation ov the PVM
package for the EE department here at duke, where it is used by gradutes 
and undergraduates for classes and research.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

I have run PVM on the following platforms, and use most of them 
regularly.

 1) A cluster of Sun workstations under Solaris 2.3 and ethernet
 2) A group of IBM RS6000
 3) A cluster of HP 735's with ATM
 4) A Cray T3D (32 proc and a 512 proc)
 5) A 486 clone under Linux. (My home machine)

The shared memory version for Sun solaris used shmemget with ID #1
or 2 or something stupid like that. Of course we had other programs
just as badly written using the same ID#, inadvertedly adressing the
same memory. Caused spectacular crashes before we corrected it.

Better debugging aids are always welcome. We haven't been able to
spawn pvm processes in a debugger window for some unknown reason.

I took a class at McGill University in Parallel Processing, and used PVM
for a programming assignment where I implemented the Chandy-Misra-Hauss
deadlock detection algorithm.  It was surprisingly easy with PVM.  When
I get more time, I'll probably use PVM for implementation of parallel
Monte-Carlo simulations on the workstation network where I work.

Dear PVM Project Team,
Thank you for soliciting my opinion. Unfortunately, I don't have much
information to send since I am a rank newbie for PVM.

We have so far not taught any parallel computing at Ryerson Polytechnic
University (Toronto). I obtained PVM after seeing the news group on
netnews. Started 'fooling around' with it Dec 94. 

To answer your questions,

1) use: teaching (potentially)
2) applications: student undergrad thesis projects (potentially)
3) Installations
	i) Sun Sparcstation multiprocessor (4) system SunOS 5.3
	(Seems to only like running one pvmd3 per processor)
	ii) Sun single processor Sparc with SunOS 5.3
	iii) IBM RS6000 Aix 3.2, one processor.
The above systems are at the University and linked by a fibre optic
backbone. Have run some of the PVM demos.
	iv) i486 running Linux
	v) i386 running Linux
These two are linked (at home) via an ethernet connection.

There are numerous issues that arose upon porting of applications to the
multiprocessors, primarily dealing with how processes were spawned on the
different processors and with the pecularities of the implementation of PVM on
that machine (PVM was not completely portable from one multiprocessor to
another). 
We also did not have much success in distributing the applications over the
different multiprocessors and having them communicate with each other.
It was also unclear how good the implementation of PVM was on the different
multiprocessors since sometimes there was a significant difference in
performance between a PVM program and a program written using the native
message-passing calls.

If you have any further questions, please dont hesitate to contact me at
anshu@cs.colorado.edu

There are many codes still using PVM 2.4 and you should continue
to publish the 2.4 to 3.x.y conversion sheets, possibly as a section
in the users' guide. I was lucky enough to have an old copy of
the conversion sheet in an old folder, but I would bet many are not
that lucky.

BTW - I received 4 copies of this message.

We are using PVM for parallel finite difference codes for flow in porous
media.  The primary platforms are IBM/RS6000's of various sorts (550,560,
590).  The only complaint I have is that at least in version 3.1, it is
not straightforward to redirect the output from the parallel tasks.  I
would prefer the ability to direct the output from a parallel task to any
given dataset.  This is particularly useful in debugging.  Is the x version
of pvm stable at this point?  When I discussed this with someone in July,
there were still a few bugs.

Thanks,

Great library. But I miss some more simplicity: The way CHARMM
was parallelized is by using four routines:
Get number of nodes
Get number of my node
send
receive

So it usually takes few hours to get it run on any parallel platform,
but it took me few days to read the whole documentation (which is very
well written - I read PVM book - thanx) and copy examples from the
book to the program. 

Sincerely yours

Are you using PVM today?

Yes.

> What are your application(s)?

I am part of team here at NIST involved in the creation of the NIST
Parallel Applications Development Environment (PADE).  This program
employs a graphical user interface under X-windows to allow parallel
applications developers using PVM to write complex parallel apps.
Programmers can edit/compile/run and debug their PVM applications while
staying within the same environment.

More info about the PADE can be found on the World-Wide-Web at

http://physics.nist.gov/ResOpp/hpcc/pade.html

for even more info you can email me (Mark Edwards) at

Paths for input and output files should be specified at the
console or in the hostfile. The current version puts the input and
output files in the HOME directory and is very inconvenient.

For example, in FORTRAN if unit 8 is written to without an
open statement, a file 'fort.8' is created. It is very bad to
put this in one's HOME directory. Many programs that are ported
from serial versions will have this kind of write statements
in them, and it would be helpful to be able to put them in a
subdirectory specified by the user.

PVM Team,

	We are not using PVM at the moment.  We are considering it

I would like to see the ability of synchronous communication,e.g. task A  
get a notification that task B got the message from A (kind of 'blocking  
send').

It would be nice if one could specify priorities for communication between  
processes. I mean that i would like to say: message-passing between task A  
and B is prioritized over communication between B and C.

I would find it useful if i could specify that the order between messages  
send is guaranteed ( following scenario: Task A send's messages to B,C,C,B;  
it would be nice if not B get his last message before C got his first ...).


Regards
Rene'

nine months to create a distributed memory parallel version of the 
software package Crayfishpak.

Roland Sweet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: rory@chemical-eng.edinburgh.ac.uk

1) Yes, I am using PVM today.

2) I have and am using PVM for 2 things:

   (i) As one means of parallelising a Dynamic Chemical Process Simulator.
       I previously used Meiko CS-Tools, but wanted to expand out into the use of
       work station clusters.

   (ii) As the communication and program management layer for a distributed, object based
        engineering environment we are developing. PVM is used to manage the machines 
        being used, spawn new object manipulation applications (methods) and to pass 
        ascii encoded objects between them. It is a Client/Server based environment were
        applications are continually being dynamically spawed and killed. We also
        have applications joining sessions without ever being spawned within PVM.

3) So far we have used SUN4s, a LINUX box and IBM RS6000s.
   I have also tried to use a SEQUENT running DYNIX/ptx(R) V2.1.1 but could not get it
   to compile. The functions gettimeofday() and ffs() were not available or no
   BSD compatibility library appears to exist for this OS.

   On System V machines the function get_clock seems to be the alternative to
   gettimeofday(). Unfortunately there is no allowance in the PVM source for easily 
   substituting gettimeofday as there is for other functions such as bcopy() for example.

Comments:
---------

Overall, I think PVM is an excellent package. My main complaints are as follows.

(i) Output management:
    I really hate the way output is managed. You either have to tail -f a /tmp file
    which usually hangs when too much output appears or you have to manage all of the
    output youself in an application you have specified wants it using the pvm_setopt
    function.

    The second of these is fine in principle. It would however be a nice touch to add an 
    option which tells PVM to manage the incoming redirected output for the programmer.
    i.e. Whenever PVM gets a message which is an output redirect is simply dumps it to
    stdout/stderr rather than expecting the programmer to deal with it.

(ii) pvm_kill()

    One of our projects uses PVM to spawn and manage many applications. Part of this
    management process is to kill application which have hung or are nolonger wanted.
    It is not always possible to send a shutdown message, and quite often we have to use
    pvm_kill().

    The problem is that pvm_kill() only sends a SIGTERM, which some applications ignore.
    I would like to see pvm_kill() extended to allow SIGKILL as well as SIGTERM, which is 
    guaranteed to kill the application. In fact, could pvm_kill() not be expanded to 
    behave in the same manner as the unix kill(), thus allowing a multitude of signals to 
    be sent to distributed applications.

    At the moment we have to log into the machine and kill the application via a shell
    which is inconvenient and outwith the applications control.

(iii) PVM to PVM connection.

    PVM only allows applications which belong to a single user to communicate. It would
    be a usefull extension to allow one users PVM to log in to and send messages to another
    users PVM. 

    In our design application each user works under a client/server environment. However
    we want each user to be able to use other users object data bases and applications. To
    do this we need to connect the servers together. At present we are having to use 
    sockets since PVM does not support inter PVM communication at present.

Hope all this helps

Rory.

Hi,

PVM survey

>>Are you using PVM today?
Yes.

>>What are your application(s)?
We are using PVM as a reference execution environment to test our
dynamic load-balancing mechanisms. Specific issues include load
distribution and redistribution, high utilization of a NOW configuration,
and communication overhead.

We are also running parallel numerical applications.

>>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
A cluster of Pentiums, 486/66 and 486/33 PC's. 

>>Any comments and suggestions for improvement ...
The current work and load distribution of PVM should be improved.
We executed PVM on top of MOSIX (our NOW OS) and observed an improvement
of 25-150% in the execution times of several parallel applications.
These results are expected to be even worse in a multiuser usage.

Bye,

    Oren.

Hello there,

> Are you using PVM today?

Yes, we use it on our 14 SGI Indigo Workstations and on a Sun Sparcstation
Pool. 

> What are your application(s)?

We are doing CFD and have ported some code to a transputer machine (Parsytec
Xplorer, NOT using PVM). We want to be able to port it to a variety of 
machines, so we consider changing it to use PVM. There is a commercial
implementation of PVM on the Parsytec machine, but we did not use this one
yet.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM

Only the SGIs and Suns mentioned, but we'll try it on the Parsytec machine
soon.

It's a nice piece of software, thanks a lot !

From: Karl.F.Moschner@urlus.sprint.com

About a year ago we downloaded a copy of PVM and successfully tested it but 
did not move ahead with implementing critical applications under PVM.  It 
was attractive but a few factors kept us from pursuing PVM:

- we are low on manpower

- commercial applications offered greater speedups on a single workstations 
  than we would have attained by implementing comparable available codes
  under PVM

- we purchased a parallel server which supported all of our software 
  without PVM and offered greater performance than all of our workstations
  combined

We have encouraged suppliers to offer PVM variants but have had no success. 
One particular commercial vendor plans to offer coarse grained network 
parallelism (automatically submit a series of jobs or readily discernable 
subprocesses across a series of identified accounts/systems).

We have been hindered in our attempts to devise an effective
parallel algorithm by the fact that PVM does not provide a primitive
for asynchronously interrupting a worker process and causing it to
start over again as though it had been killed and respawned. 
Instead we must either kill and respawn the process (which has a
very high overhead indeed) or poll within the worker (which is
inconvenient and also wastes time).  There should be a way within
the worker to set a program interrupt exit: "whenever you get this
signal from the master program, stop whatever it is you are doing
and go back to statement n".  And there should be a way within the
master to send the signal that says "abandon that calculation and
get ready for a new assignment".

I was working on a dynamic load balancing API for PVM. PVM currently 
provides point to point communication constructs for communication (or 
multicast). The sender iss aware of who is going to receive the message.
I developed an API based on heirarchical farms where the farmer task 
makes a number of woprk packets and sends it to a central server. The 
workers group themselves into process worker classes (multiple farms per 
application, multiple worker classes per farm, multiple worker tasks (pvm 
tasks) per worker class, worker can in turn be a farmer - heirarchical 
farm, and dynamic worker task migration from one farm to another) and 
receive work packets only when they request for one. This way, the 
workers on slow nodes get fewer work packets and the application is load 
balanced. If you want the report of my project, I will be glad to give it 
to you.

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Two suggestions:

1) I would like to see the bug fixed that prevents pvm_pkbyte()/pvm_upkbyte()
   pairs from being able to pack/unpack in different groupings; eg 6 calls
   to pvm_pkbyte() packing one byte each and 2 calls to pvm_upkbyte() unpacking
   3 bytes each.  This works in the data raw mode but not in the data
   default mode.  Since this can be done with all other types, it should
   be made to function properly with the byte type.

   I have reported this before, but was told that this is considered
   a feature and not a bug.

2) Message contexts for library development would be a BIG improvement.

Steve

Not exactly today, but we have been using it off and on and it will be used

We have used PVM as a vehcile for a load sharing program we developed and I
am still hoping we can incorporate it as part of PVM.
Currently we are looking at using it to parallelise the
Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm used in our work. It is a prime
candidate due to its computational and memory requirements.

> 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

So far just Suns (SPARC II, ELCs) running SunOS 4.1.3.
We have a two-processor SGI Onyx and if a native message-passing version of
PVM is available (I haven't checked the latest version yet) it may used to
explore/exploit the SGI.

> 
> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

I have a project looking at the various ways and means of communicating
using the TCP protocols directly to examine the most effective
communication standard for parallel algorithms (e.g connectionless UDP .vs.
connectioned streams). One problem I found with PVM was that its internal
buffering meant that if I wanted to transer X Mb of data I would need to
have 2X Mb of memory. I haven't yet tested the latest version which allows
user control of buffer management. On the otherhand for most parallel 
algorithms there are many small-data (< 1024 kb) communications and a way
to optimally handle this would be useful (this is what the above project is
going to try and figure out).

If you would like further clarification or have suggestions please do not
hesitate to contact me. I am definitely interested in the area of parallel
computation over networked computers.

Hi I am using PVM extensively for teaching and research. I use it to teach
in the Advanced Computer Systems Course at the Honours level in my School
and ususlly I get 22 to 24 post graduate students in this subject.  I also
use it for applied projects in Signal processing and other algorithmic
work.

In fact I am finding it very hard to process the data i am getting just due
to mere volume.  I would appreciate if any one can collaborate with me to
get the reports converted into journal papers.  I am willing to offer
the source code and the co-authorship.  At present I have 14 technical
reports sitting on my desk all of them are work using PVM on 8 machines.

  I used PVM as a senior at Clemson University for a class project.
We were assigned the task of using PVM to do a distributed merge-sort between
5 or more machines (simple task, but it was used to demonstrate process
control and communication for the class which was about Operating Systems)
I had been a cooperative education student with Naval Electronic Systems
Engineering Center, (NAVELEX), Charleston - a DOD/Navy command, and had 
access to several Sun machines that were distributed across the US.  I used
PVM to do my merge sort between 5 machines, each being in a different city
in the US.  Each machine was an identical Sun SPARC 10/41 and the links were
T1 and ethernet.  I got a 'A' for the effort and I found PVM to be easy to
use and well documented.  I guess I should kinda say Thanks!

From: chik@icot.or.jp (Takashi Chikayama)

Hideaki Moriyama (hideaki@hydra.cray.com) forwarded me your message
calling for feedback on PVM.  Here's mine.

Are you using PVM today?

	Yes.

What are your application(s)?

	In an implementation of a parallel logic programming language
	called KLIC (available by anonymous ftp from ftp.icot.or.jp).
	There are several other (more efficient) implementations
	dependent on platforms, but the PVM version is meant to be
	portable.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

	- SparcCenter 2000 (20 processors)
	- DEC AXP-7000 (6 processors)
	- SparcStation 10/52 systems, connected with ethernet (8
	  systems with 16 processors in total)

Comments:

	To build a symbolic processing system for dynamic and
	irregular computation, it is desirable to asynchronously
	interrupt other processes to stop or suspend speculative
	computation and start computation newly known to be mandatory.
	We use sendsig for the purpose, but sendsig sometimes
	outstrips ordinary messages, which is a problem because the
	receiver may receive no messages after receiving the signal.
	Our implemetation currently use timer-driven polling in
	combination to make it up, but it is an awkward solution.  It
	would be much better if PVM could provide some feature that
	guarantees that the signal arrives *after* specified messages
	(though I'm not sure whether it can be implemented in a
	portable manner or not).

Now we have installed PVM on 8 SGI indigo R4000 connected in a local network
and some i486s, which are used for simulation in single machine.

We have found PVM is quite good environment for network computation.
Many thanks for your supporting PVM.

Sorry that I cannot do much help.  I moved to TCGMSG because 
the programme I'm using was revised to fit TCGMSG.  I think 
PVM is much more polular than TCGMSG, and is the de fact standard. 
Besides this, in the field of chemistry, TCGMSG has something.

PVM is extremely portable and reasonably efficient. We wish the packing
calls could be automated. For example, have a parser that parses a function
call such as pvm_send(tid, tag, arg1, arg2, ...) where arg1, arg2 can be of
different types (e.g, complex structures) and by determining the types of
the arguments it generates pack calls. This could be a preprocessor to C
compilation. Also if something can be provided under PVM for the advanced
system programmer who might want to use various socket options (such as
select etc.) it will be useful.

  The program has been run under a heterogeneous network of work stations of
  a total of 12 machines.  The network consists of DEC-ALPHA, IBM-RS6000 and 
  IBM-PowerPC computers.

  On the other hand, a modified version of the same program runs under

  I wish it was a little bit faster on a heterogenous network.  For comparison
  a version of utchem runs under c-linda system.  And that version is faster
  than the pvm version.

From: Eddie Johnson <johnsone@turing.uncg.edu>

Hello,

	I am not currently using PVM today, but I did use it in a class
on parallel computing.  We used PVM on 15 Sun Stations to implement a
matrix multiplication routine and a prime number generator.  The
PVM platform ran very well, and I was quite impressed.  One thing I noticed
was that entering a large number of machines from the PVM command
prompt to form a conference was sometimes cumbersome, and I wish there
was a faster method of handling this.  I wrote my own code to add machines
to the conference, but it would be nice if this code was already in
place, possibly in the form of reading a text file of host names and
adding them to the conference?  Just an idea...

	I would like to congratulate you on the design of such as
amazing platform.  Keep up the good work!

It would be fine to have in PVM the same mechanism for message induced
processes like in EXPRESS. In EXPRESS it is possible to define a special 
category of messages. If such a message is send to a curtain processor, a
user-defined process is initiated. In that user-defined procedure it is
possible to send further messages (normal and special type messages). So you
can submitt results of that procedure call to the initiating processor. That
kind of special messages gives you a convenient tool for programming of
- for instance - memory managers for large amounts of distributed data.

Sincerely yours,

I'm on myself just making benchmarks on diferent (virtual) parallel
architectures. We have written a "benchmark generator" so everyone can
make his own benchmarks on his own parallel architecture with his own
application specific workload. So everyone who wants to use a (virtual)
parallel machine can test the computing and the communication behaviour before
he buys the machine.

I'm using up to eight HPPA workstations, a CONVEX parallel computer
and in future a CRAY.

We like to run our project on an NCUBE because it grows up on an it 
under PICL. But there is no version of PVM for the NCUBE.
So, we would like to have an version for the NCUBE.

I hope this helps you,

Karsten Zander

PVM we implemented a communications
facility modeled after the channels of Occam and the transputer. We
designed interfaces for C, C++, Common Lisp, Prolog and Tcl/Tk. The
communication system is actually used within the German joint research
project Verbmobil for message passing between different
modules. Additionaly, it is used to explore novel architectonic issues
for natural language understanding systems, which are inverstigated as
a subproject of Verbmobil.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
I personally use Sun Sparstations 2 and 10 under SunOs 4.1.x and Solaris 2.3
Other partners in our project use HP Workstations under HPUX or IBM RS6000
(and maybe some others which I don't know of).

Yes, I'm using PVM at the moment.
I'm using PVM in the development of a parallel regularized decomposition
algorithm for the solution of large scale nonlinear stochastic programming
problems. Subproblems are solved by GAMS, called as a child process
from within the PVM processes.
I'm using PVM on a network of SUN workstations running SUNOS and SOLARIS.

1. I would like to have for instance better support for a logical
   task numbering scheme, instead of having to assign the numbers
   myself at program initialization from the array of TIDs given
   to pvm_spawn. Program initialization in general is a bit
   heavy to my taste.

2. Why not include some kind of support for RPC ?  It seems to me
   that this also is a mechanism many users have to implement
   manually in PVM.

Dear makers of PVM,
first of all, I would like to thank you for publishing PVM.

>Are you using PVM today?
Yes.

>What are your application(s)?
I'm using PVM to run simulations in parallel on our network. The
simulations are time-continous, time-discrete and event-driven.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
I'm using four SUN Workstations (with a total of five processors).

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
>Please email the information to pvm-survey@cs.utk.edu.
I was up and running in a short time. The only problem was my own mistake.
I put the PVM_ROOT environment variable into the interactive section of my
.cshrc file. I discussed this in the news-groups. It seems, that I'm not
the only person, which did this wrong. It could be helpfull to put a
warning into the manual.

Kind regards

Dear  PVM Project Team,

thanks for your question.
We installed PVM 3.2 on a Fujitsu VP2600 at our site and tried
an simplified implementation ov PVM 2 on the Fujitsu VPP 500 
vector parallel computer.
But as we received a PARMACS implementation for our computers, which
delivers more performance on the VPP500, we do not
use PVM for production purposes at the moment.
Because we have such a large mono processor, the users do not need
to parallelize their applications.
In future this situation might change.
Probably our interest might turn to MPI than.
I will forward your question to my collegue Stefan Karsch, who
is more involved in pVM for academical reasons.

Best wishes

1) No, I am not using PVM today.

2) I am working on a Monte Carlo fortran code to simulate the 
   radiative transfer of photons in an ocean-atmosphere system.

3) I am presently working on the code and have not yet implemented
   the parallelization of the computation of the photon histories
   on multiple processors, but have the firm intention of doing so in the
   future. To do this I was thinking of using PVM.
   
4) Can you give me an anonymous ftp adress (or something similar) 
   where I can find the latest version of PVM?

Many thanks,

We are about to examine to use PVM as an alternative 
to EXPRESS which shows some instabilities 
when using many nodes (>15) in our workstation cluster.
We have just installed XPvm and ran succesfully some 
'hello_world' tests, but the main work is still to do.

We are doing Fluid-Flow simulations with Lattice-Gas methods
and Traffic Flow simulations with Cellular Automata, 
beside we are planning to do Finite Element parallelization.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

We did the tests with up to 35 machines HP 715-50 and 735-100
(connected by standard ethernet) and the hello_worlds were o.k., 
beside we just received a Parsytec cluster with 16 nodes based on 
the Power-PC chip but this machine is being installed right now 
and there are no results yet. 


> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
> 
Having used EXPRESS in the last years I very much appreciated
functions like automatic domain decomposition (mapping a matrix
onto a cluster of nodes) and utility functions that effectively
help sending parts of rows and columns of matrices through the 
system effectively. As these are tasks that almost everybody needs
is there something in progress or even completed yet ?
It would be a waste of time if everybody hacks these things
on his own ?!

Applications are written in house to perform computational stealth calculations
which can be parallelised to run on a variety of platforms, such as SG 
Challenge and CRAY T3D machines. Efficiency on such platforms is high.

Only a network of DEC alpha machines.

It would be useful if, upon taking a node out of the network, all of the 
results didn't become jibberish. The probability of node removal increases
with the number of available nodes and this appears to be the situation when
PVM would be most useful.

	We have 16 IBM RS/6000 model 590 and a 16 node SP2.


Our main problem with PVM (from a system administrator viewpoint) is the 
many incompatible versions that needs to be maintained.

Not for the moment but we certainly will. We are currently installing an ATM
Local Area Network in our Lab based on the Fore Systems' switch and their
adaptation cards for workstations. As I saw that a PVM version that works with
the Fore System API exists, I'm waiting our LAN to be ready to do the first
tests with PVM over ATM.

Distributed simulations of ATM switches and networks.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

Our Lab. currently has about 15 HP workstations and 3 SUNs. 8 of these
stations will be connected through our ATM switch. The others are connected to
the Ethernet backbone.

I'm using PVM, release 3.3.3, currently being upgraded.
The applications running in PVM environment are linear algebra routines
and Finite-Difference Time-Domain codes (for the analysis of electromagnetic
propagation in wave-guides).
At the moment, I have clustered 2 HP ws (715 and 735) and an IBM 320h.
I'm going to add an IBM 250t also.
A porting of other applications, including some combinatorial optimization
codes using Tabu Search methods and Finite-Difference Frequaency-Dependent
Time-Domain codes, is planned in the next future under PVM.
Two main fields can be identified for our use of PVM codes:

1) Microwave wave-guides engineering

2) Effects of Electromagnetic radiations on biological systems

That's all.

Bye bye and happy new year to everyone!

In answer to your questions:

? Are you using PVM today ?

Not today, but recently.

? What are your application(s) ?

Two kinds:

Genetic algorithms for large-scale optimization. The function evaluations,
for our application, being performed in parallel. As these are by far the
dominant cost, good speedups are possible.

Solution of linear systems using both direct and iterative methods.
Parallel multifrontal methods for the direct solution, and element-by-
element preconditioned cg for the iterative solution.

? How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM ?

At one time I had a network running between the UK, France and Canada.
This involved:

6 Suns, 2 RS/6000s, 6 Alphas, 5 HP/9000s and a YMP in the UK,
8 Suns and 4 RS/6000s in France and
2 Suns in Canada

Hope this is useful,

My group use PVM in some parallelisation work we are doing. The application is
Computational Fluid Dynamics. Machines are IBM SP1/SP2 and clustered
workstations.
Suggestions for improvements. Forgive my naive question, but I thought MPI was
supposed to be the improvement for PVM, and the long term future. I have no
suggestions for improvement, except to say that the most important issues are
standardisation, robustness and speed. It is relativly easy to change message
passing libraries, but I don't want lots of different versions, for different
versions of PVM, MPI, PARMACS...... If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Dear Colleagues,

as my english isn't the best, I apologize in advance for the various 
mistakes.

We are working on an offline task-allocation-manager for a multiprozessor-
realtime-system. The goal is to find an as cheap a possible allocation of 
the tasks on this system without any deadlines. The whole task-allocation-
manager is separated in four parts:
	1. grafical editor (for defining the system)
	2. alalyzer (for checking all deadlines)
	3. optimizer with simulated annealing
	4. optimizer with genetic algorithms (GA)
Since the number of possible sollutions is to big to compute complete, the
given heuristics are used. 
The GA-optimizer is my part to implement. To compete with the simulated
annealing in speed, I'm trying to spawn each Individual of the GA on one
extra computer. 
GA is based on the evoluation process found by Darwin. Each Individual
contains an task-allocation-table (TAT), exchanges with other Individuals 
genes (parts of that TAT), mutates slightly and selects the fitest for
forming the next generation. 
I first tried sockets and PVM and have decided to use PVM.
In the next week we are trying to move the editor aout of the programm in
an extra task as it is bound to LINUX. 
The used computers are: 
	3 DEC alphas
	3 LINUX (i486)
	5 IBM 6000 (RS6K)
	4 SUN4
	2 MIPS

I was amzed how easy the PVM-system was installed on all our computers. 

One thing I'm not happy about is that LINUX-machines need somtimes about
one minute to follow the pvm_addhost call, but I fear this is a
LINUX-problem and not yours. Sometimes the PVM-deamons don't follow an halt
command, and loop abandoned on the host. I'm trying a workaround with a 
shell-script. An security system watching over lost hosts and lost
tasks would be a fine thing.

As conclusion I want to thank you for PVM as it has spared me much
frustration with sockets. I hope I could help you.

Best wishes
Stefan Petters

We are using PVM 3.3.4 today.
We are developing CFD code (FEM, Domain Decomposition).
We used not more than 7 machines in parallel.
Our code runs on PC386/486 (LINUX), 
                 SUN SPARCstations (SunOS 4.1.2)
                 HP 9000/735 (HP-UX 9.05), 
                 DEC ALPHA (OSF/1).
We used these machines heterogen in parallel.
Comments:
unfotunately PVM is not available (public domain) for
the German Transputer systems (Parsytec) based on T805 Transputers
and PowerPC Chips. And, the commercially available products
(PVM/PARIX - Genias software, Germany) do not work satisfactory  
and are only PVM 3.2 compatible.

To avoid overhead with process grouping, I use a pseudo-broadcast to
all running PVM-processes (calling pvm_tasks(0,...) first, then
sending multicast to each host). This may be a useful function for the
PVM system.
I don't know how to get a unique TAG for my messages -- couldn't PVM
provide some function for this purpose?

Dear PVM-Team,

> Are you using PVM today?
Yes, we've just started ''playing with it''

> What are your application(s)?
One of my students investigates performance benefits
of a ''parallel make'' application in a network of
workstations, which runs 'make -n' and distributes
the generated command lines via PVM and carries them
out remoteley.
\\
Has any comparable work already been done somewhere?
Is there a parallel make application?

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
We have a Pool of 25 Sun/ELC,IPC workstations.


> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
We have just started working with PVM and it really seems
easy to use.
Wishes for improvements will shurely rise while working
with PVM. If I have ideas, I'll let You know.

Good luck,

Not today and propably not this week, but I have used it in the past

MPI Direction.

> 
> What are your application(s)?
We have an IBM-SP2 (10 nodes, HPS) and an SGI-challenge (14 CPUs, SHM)
which are used for calculations, data aquisition, data analysis
and simulation in High energy physics.
We have successfully converted a simulation program for muon showers
and are working on some kind of half automated process which aids
physicists in converting existing FORTRAN code into a parallel form.
Plans are to use parallel computers for Data aquisition.
Up to now we are investigating different models of parallel
programming and theier use for our applications.
For testing purposes we have develloped a PVM-driver for MPICH and a
SHM-driver for MPICH with the aim to test, if we would be able to use
MPI for special real time parallel processors.
> 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
An IBM-SP2 with 10 nodes and HPS, over IP emulation and standard Ethernet.
An SGI-challenge with 14 processors and shared memory.

> 
> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
I dislike the way PVM forces a user to make links in ~/pvm/arch to the
executable. Although I can see that you need such a mechanism for
a heterogenous environment it would be nice, if PVM would just take
the path to the actual executable if all architectures are the same.
This would ease the task for a computing center to provide simple
users with parallel applications.

The Shared memory implementation of PVM still needs some attention.
The situation has improved but is far away from being perfect.
I would not give any parallel application based on PVM-SGIMP
to our normal users. The risc would be too high, that the machine resources
will be blocked completely.

Apart from my critics above PVM is really a very nice and efficient tool.
Thank you for the work you have done.

Hi!

  I am "maintainer" of PVM at our Faculty of Mathematics and Physics
(Comenius University Bratislava, SLOVAKIA) and I got (forwarded from
sk2eu.eunet.sk) your questions about using PVM.


Are you using PVM today?
========================

  Yes. Especially one my graduate student is now working intensively with it.

What are your application(s)?
=============================

  They are more "pedagogical". Student is testing different Gauss-Seidel
methods for problem arising from 1D parabolic PDE, I plan (if ...) to work
with the same for 3D problem (with PLTMG in FORTRAN from Netlib).

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
==========================================================

  Once I tried 8 different DECstations with Ultrix and 7 SUN SparcStations
with Solaris.

Any comments and suggestions ...
================================

  PVM (and especially XPVM) is working well for us. If some things will be
decided about my future in some manner, I plan to devote more time to PVM
and I am sure it will be used by more and more people at our faculty.

  Continue with your nice and useful work!

Thank you for your mail message asking about the use of PVM.
Yes, I use PVM for about 2 months now. I wrote a code performing
a 3-dimensional FFT on a cubic grid. The cube is divided into 
2-D slices, each one residing on a single processor. This code
is part of a larger project pointing toward the solution of
Maxwells equation for a given charge distribution.
Up to the now, I mainly used an emulator on a SUN4, but I'm turning
over to a CRAY T3D with 128 processor nodes for the production runs.
I hope that this information will be useful for you.

Hello,

Although I haven't yet used PVM, I might do it sometimes in the (not very near)
future. I plan to implement a parallel language with algorithmic skeletons.
Therefore, the idea of of building upon PVM is not central to my pursuit. I
have thought of the PVM (or maybe MPI, but PVM seems to me more mature at the
time) interface as a means to implement my language on different architectures,
mainly a Parsytec transputer network and a Sparc workstation cluster. I am aware
that the use of a standard library will lead to a slow-down of my programs,
and since I have to get the best possible speedups, the standard library is,
as I already have said, not central to my project. Nevertheless, depending on
how things will evolve, I will keep you informed on any progress.

To summarize:

* I am not using PVM today, but might do so in the future

* I am planning to implement a parallel language with algorithmic skeletons

* The available hardware consists at the time of a transputer network
  (T800's from Parsytec) and a bunch of Sun Sparc workstations. Furthermore,
  some other machines, such as an Intel Paragon, might be available.

I truly doubt that my answer will be of importance to you, but if anything
changes, I will contact you.

Best regards,

Horatiu Botorog

Development and debugging of our code was done under OS/2 on a single 
486-66. No problems were encountered during this stage of the 
development. However we could not get a network of OS/2 machines to 
work. PVM failed to connect to / locate the other processors. 
Unfortunately, I do not have the OS/2 TCPIP developers kit and I am 
therefore unable to find out what the problem is. 

All the best

	Dear sir,

	We've been using PVM for a few months now. The target program
	is a finite element one first developped for a shared memory
	multiprocessor and adapted for PVM using a SPMD model.

	The PVM program runs on a SGI cluster (we've used up to 4 of
	them) and has been compiled on a single LINUX based PC.
	We will, in the near future use this program on a small PC
	network (probably with LINUX).

	Programs are written in fortran and good speedups were obtained.

	If you ever need more information please just e-mail me.
	I'll be glad to give you more details.

	Yours sincerely,

Hi,

I am using PVM3.3.2 in the field of seismic ray tracing in order
to perform tomography.
The parallel architecture is master/slave, using a farming
strategy and automatic load-balancing.

I experimented PVM both on networked SUN4 workstations and CM5.

Dear Colleague,

We compiled PVM for two SUN Sparcstations (type 5 and 20) and HP (apollo 700).
We plan to compile it also for SGI indy.

It works O.K., once the PVM-deamons are started, but halting
gives problems. Often if PVM is halted on the main machine, the deamons on
the other machines don't stop. I then have to kill the processes manually
and remove the files pvmd.xxx (Both XPVM and the PVM-console have this)

This problem occurs on all machines.

We plan to use PVM in the MIAMI project (http://kunpu7.psych.kun.nl/miami/),
because it looks promising for communication between agents on different hosts.

Greetings,
	Jan Nijtmans

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to answer your questions in the PVM survey as follows:

We are running PVM on a network of twelve Sun SPARCstations (different
types: SPARCstations 1, 1+, 2, iPC, 10). However, we have only just
started this, and we are still more or less learning how to use it
for ourselves. We do not have any 'serious' applications yet, 
just some experiments to se how parallelism works. 

If we are successful in teaching PVM to ourselves, then we plan 
to teach it to graduate students in the context of parallel 
algorithms in numerical analysis, but this is going to be 
somewhen in the future (no specific date yet).

Yours,
  Kai Diethelm.

> Are you using PVM today?
Yes, I use pvm every day quite heavily.

>What are your application(s)?
I am curently building a SPMD parallel version of our soft. RADIOSS.
RADIOSS is a Finite Element package for mechanical enginieering,
used mainly to simulate car crash (but also train, planes...). The average
CPU for a full car simulation is in the 10 hours range on  a CRAY YMP and
can go up to about 150 hours. Hence we  (and our customers) are very interested
in parallel solutions and we build already a shared memory and a data parallel ve
parallel version. The SPMD version should become industrial end of february.
We already achieve speedups of 14.9 on 16 prcs on SP2 for academic tests.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
Right now we have worked only on IBM platforms (SP1 SP2) but we will try
other platforms within the next quarter and plane to replace the shared mem. versio
version with the SPMD one.

To whom it may concern,

	1. We are using PVM in the implementation phase of our new parallel 
		algorithms. Furthermore when comparing speedups on different 
		parallel architectures we also consider a workstation cluster 
		communicating with PVM.

	2. Our applications are parallel numerical algorithms for the solution
		of partial differential equations.The features provided are 
		unstructured grids, local mesh refinement and adaptivity in the
		solution cycle. One parallel aspect of interest is the redistriution
		of the mesh on the processors gaining an equal load and low 
		communication needs.
		In this field we develop fast, efficient solvers for large sparse 
		matrices, especially we use the multigrid approach.

	3. Up to this time we ran PVM on clusters of SUNs, SGIs and PCs. I also
		just used the CRAY implementation of PVM on a CRAY T3D with 32 PEs.

Hope to help you.

Dear PVM people,
I am in charge of high performance computing applications
in one of Elf (the french Petroleum company) research lab
in London.

We have developped a parallel reservoir simulator and we do
use PVM to run it.

It is useful to us in 2 ways, first to run on our cluster of
up to 8 HP workstations (720, 750 and 735) and then because
it is supported by all vendors so we can run tests on their
machine with little modification to the code. (Cray, Convex
and IBM namely).

Regarding future directions of PVM, we are not using xpvm to
monitor our parallel programs. I have noticed a few shortcomings,
first it is very slow when the density of communications is
high. Then I think it would be great to display the source
code by clicking on the time bar for instance as it is done
for the messages.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

We are using the following computers:

 All computers are linked in an ethernet LAN.

PVM is truly a very good system for distributed processing.  
We have been able to adjust our software (which ran on one computer)
to PVM within a half day!

Also, the program compiles on every machine we use without any error.  
This means that PVM accomplishes some of the highest demands, being 
PORTABLE !

However we also experience that the fact that PVM is build on existing 
SLOW network protocols, the latency is very high.  This is also because 
we use lots of small messages (200-500 messages/second with 50-100 bytes 
each).  An improvement for small messages would be a great breakthrough.

We will continue to evaluate PVM versions in the future and use it in our 
software development.

Kris.

PVM should be made thread-safe. This means, that the message buffer management 
routines should handle multiple buffers at once. The distinction could be made 
by specifying the buffer as an argument to all pvm_pack*() and pvm_unpack*() 
functions.

In reply to your survey, yes I will be using PVM today.  I am working
on a trivial cellular automata at the moment but the main part of my
project is to build a system to run on top of PVM to provide a framework
into which many applications can be slotted just by changing small sections
of code.  I am using  SUN SPARCstations provided by the university and the
university computing department on two seperate networks, and there are 
about 50 machines in my hostfile I think.

I hope this has been of some help to you and good luck for the future.

UNix and/or PVM often crashes when all workstations are running PVM 
simultaneously, which leads often to frustration of the users and
unkindness of the system administrator. In particular,
the system get sometimes halted so that the keyboard is disconnected
and the machine has to be physically switched off to be rebooted.

I happen on some occasions to crash the kernel while using PVM/XPVM intensively
(i.e. about 300 PVM tasks scattered among 30 DEC stations, in trace mode.)
I haven't been able to recreate the situation on purpose, though.
PVM seems to be a very stable devellopment environment.

Suggestions:
------------
- The use of an buffer ADT in order to avoid side effects with a global sbuf 
and
  global rbuf. (it proves to be a real annoyance and error prone with signals 
and
  threads).  

- A support for threads in a PVM task.

- A support for PVM in the programming language (a preprocessor or the like)
  which would, for instance, allow to send complex structures without requiring
  the pack/unpack sequence.

- It might already exist but a true Object-Oriented API to PVM could prove
  useful in the mid term (with objects duplication, object migration 
facilities,
  ...), or some OO fusion of PVM and the ISIS library develloped by Ken Birman
  at Cornell for distributed computing.

- If a PVM micro kernel were implemented and the current PVM API one of many
  software layers running on top of it, the previous suggestion could be 
  implemented as one of these software layers, and many more API could be
  tailored for different purposes.

Happy new Year !

1. I have programs waiting to be modified to run under PVM, but pressure
   of other general sysadmin work has pushed the PVM work down in priority.

2. Four programs so far, related to Synchrotron Radiation research,
   i. Small Angle X-ray Simulation.
  ii. Calculation of the mass projection of a model structure.
 iii. Diffraction pattern simulation.
  iv. Background subtraction and Peak fitting of experimental diffraction
      patterns.

3. I have been using a group of Silicon Graphics machines, Indy, Indigo2
   and 2-processor Challenge (Not using multi-processor PVM). Other machines
   to be included later are Sun (probably Solaris 2.4), HP and IBM w/stations.
   Potentially 10 or so machines could be used, but so far the programs have
   been tested on only 3 of 4 to demonstrate that it works and is worth doing.

You might pass over the following to Vaidy Sunderam - he might remember me
from the heterogeneous network computing workshop in October 1991 in
Tallahassee. 

I have finished my Ph.D. thesis in summer 1993 where I had been using PVM for

real-time interactive particle simulations using PVM 2.4.3. Since then I
never 
worked in the area of cluster computation again. Since summer 1993 I am now 
working for ABB (Asea Brown Boveri, which builds Power Plants, electrical 
transmission, and railways) in the Swiss corporate research center working on

HCI and Control system engineering topics. 

I am still interested in the cluster computing area - so please keep me on 
your list. My email address is now sinkwitz@chcrc.abb.ch. Please remove 
"sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch".

Best regards, Rainer

>
>What are your application(s)?

	I am working with the Advanced Computational Research Group
in the Centre for Condensed Matter and Biomaterials, part of the
Chemistry department in University College Dublin.

	Our area of interest is the application of parallelism to
the simulation of polymers (primary interest), DNA, and proteins,
allowing complex simulations to be run in reasonable time.

	I myself have only just started recently, and as such have no
particular area from which to draw examples.

	However over the summer I was working with DEC in Galway, and
while there I worked on the development of a framework Resource
Manager for PVM, PVMRM. I hope to be able to continue working on
this application, to tidy up some of the code, improve it's
genericity, and improve the default scheduling algorithms. A
version of the RM has been used in Platform's LSF V2 release.

>
>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

	Here in the ACRG we have 3 DEC ALpha ws's, 4 SGI Iris Indigo's,
and a DECstation 5000 connected to a MasPar 1, all of which have
been used in conjunction, connected with PVM, on a number of
occaisions.

>
>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

	Well I have already suggested a number of possible improvements
and corrections to Robert Manchek and Jim Pruyne while I was working
on the RM over the summer, but a quick summary would be:

	Using an RM - the console code won't recognise external RM's
				(this was up to 3.3.4... I haven't checked the latest
				 sources)
				  the unclean pvm_addhost() external RM interface:
				  it doesn't check the return value, just uses it as
				  a count of the number of tid's in msg, so if -1
				  is returned it attempts to unpack.

	The SM Protocol:
		no way to remove a host using the protocol
		no way to extract task status (running, msg wait, PVM wait)
			from the protocol
		no way to exchange state information with PVM or other RM's
			on startup or handoff, information such as the notify
			database.
		no way to modify state information such as host to htid
			mappings, and tid to host mappings which would be useful
			for the implementation of task and host migration.
			(Ok so this is probably a pipe dream!)

 The project I am working on is an European colaboration project (ESPRITT) that

to this new language (and as I work for the portuguese power company) we plan
to implement a parallel model of a power plant, and try to run it in real time.

I have some questions on PVM:

 1 - If I choose to receive a only messages with a certain tag or coming from a
certain tid, what happens to the messages that arrive in the meantime? Are they
lost or are they read later after a message with the desired tag arrives?

 2 - Is there a PVM mailing list? I know there is comp.parallel.pvm, but I 
prefer mailing lists to newsgroups.

Now that sockets are available for windows and windows for workgroups is ready
to use, should it not be time for windows version of PVM? Here in EDP, and I
think that is the general case in most companies I know, the main computing 
power are the hundreds of PCs around the building, while there are comparatively
few workstations available. Eventually we could install Linux on those PCs, but
somehow I don't think that the network manager would see that with good eyes :-)

I am currently using PVM and I have tried both master-and-slave
technique and SPMD. I work on numerical models using finite element and
implicit time discretizations on trasport equations.

I think it's working fine. Anyway I wonder if it were
possible to work using non-blocking receive. I'm not an expertise in this
matter, but I have found some problems when I use SPMD mode and I exchange
informations between among slaves: a non-blocking receive could be useful
I think, because it would avoid some bottlenecks. 
Also, if it were possible to have a proper strategy and a set of subroutine
to properly measure CPU time, overhead, and latencys, well, it would be great!

Anyway, I greatly appreciate your work, 'cause PVM is enough easy to understand
and quite direct to use. I hope you'll continue this way.

Cheers

I am using today PVM to study distributed systems in my university.
My university is NEW UNIVERSITY OF LISBON an we use it in our programs.
The PVM is installed in a ethernet network of pc-computers and others computers.
I think that PVM is not reliable enough to program with it quickly.
Personaly, I found one bug. It was a variable used several times by pvm calls that
losted its value. But I am a student, so I do not knowledge enough to be critic of PVM.
But, if you want, I can sen you the program with the bug.

Dear PVM team,

> Are you using PVM today?

Yes.

> What are your application(s)?

We, the Initial Value Problem group of Peter van der Houwen of the
numerical mathematics department of CWI, Amsterdam are working on
parallel ODE/DAE solvers in a project called `Parallel Codes for
Circuit Analysis and Control Engineering'.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

At present we focus on an implementation on a cluster of locally
available workstations. Our typical PVM is homogeneous and consists
of Silicon Graphics Indys (100 MHz R4000SC) coupled by an ethernet.
We could also use FDDI or even ATM, but we try to get a speed-up
using fast machines on a relatively slow network.

On a Parsytec GCel/512 we use Homogeneous PVM 1.0$\alpha$
(based on public domain PVM 3.2.6).

On an IBM 9076 SP1 we use IBM AIX PVMe Version 1 Release 2
(based on public domain PVM 3.2(.5)).

Finally, I tried SGIMP and I even played 1 hour with PVM on a
Cray T3D (at present I do not have access to such a machine).

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

I would love to have full Fortran support e.g.

	- pvmfstart_pvmd

and

	- pvmfgettmask
	- pvmfsettmask
	- the functionality of pvmtev.h
	  (Could parameters and statement functions
	  using MIL-STD-1753 bit field manipulation intrinsic functions
	  do the trick? OK, not portable.
	  Using External functions instead of macros? Performance does
	  not seem to be the issue here.)

The last category would be for creating a decent xpvm-aware spmd
executable.

A minor point perhaps: the possibility to do a quiet pvm_mytid.
This is for a PVM executable that does its own pvm_start_pvmd,
if required. I do not want to hassle users by bogus warnings:

	libpvm [pid1213]: /tmp/pvmd.232: No such file or directory
	libpvm [pid1213]: /tmp/pvmd.232: No such file or directory
	libpvm [pid1213]: /tmp/pvmd.232: No such file or directory
	libpvm [pid1213]: pvm_mytid(): Can't contact local daemon

if the `local daemon' is started by the executable itself.

We have been trying to use pvm to link two different
thermal-hydraulic computer codes together to perform
nuclear reactor transient and accident analyses.  The
codes that we are trying to link are RELAP5 and CONTAIN.

ACtually, the work has been going on at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory and the Brookhaven National Laboratory
under contract to us, for about two years.  The link portion
seems to work well, but we have been experiencing problems 
with the physics of the two codes, as well as time-step
consistency.  We believe that pvm could be very useful
to us, and we would also like to link some of out thermal-
hydraulics codes to our neutron physics codes.

Are you using PVM today?

'Today' in the literally sense: NO
'Today' in the sense of 'still using it regularly': YES
 
What are your application(s)?
Genetic Algorithm

	- We place different (sub-)populations on different processors.
	  Every once in a while individuals migrate from one population
	  to another one thus exchanging information.

	- Currently, for some time consuming fitness functions we are
	  implementing a distributed evaluation of that fitness function
	  in that for every individual one processor performs the evaluation.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
Mainly SUN workstations. Since last week, we have access to an EXPLORER (?)
system via a SUN workstation as front end. EXPLORER is a parallel computer
based on the Power PC chip for computation and transputers for communication.
It's a Parsytec computer.


Hope that helps. If you are interested in more details, please let me know.

From: mgs@rio.cos.ufrj.br (Marcio Goncalves da Silva)

Dear Colleagues,
	here are the answers with wich I can contribute to the improvement of PVM.
>Are you using PVM today?
Yes.

>What are your application(s)?
I am writing a little part of a program with the student Andre' Belllieny (bellieny@rio.cos.ufrj.br). This software is a tool for evaluating overhead brought by the memory consistency model "release consistency". Each PVM task simulates a hardware architecture that implements a consistency protocol.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
We have used only SUN Sparcstations2 and have had some problems mounting the virtual machines. Andre' Bellieny has more specific information on this matter.

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
I will probably write more parts of the program or even other ones, and then I will probably have real suggestions to give.

From: Geordie +1865 740 011 <ayoung@vax.ox.ac.uk>

Are you using PVM today?

Yes.

What are your application(s)?

Genetic likelihoods - ie. recursive computations of probabilities involving
heavy use of CPU with only occasional file accesses. Run times of serial
versions on DEC ALphas between 1 second and months.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

DEC Alpha, DEC Ultrix and SUN Solaris systems.  Maximum configuration of
6 machines simultaneously.

Main suggestion:

[1] better debugging facilities.

[2] a note about system overheads in the documentation - ie. something that
would allow us to assess the trade-off between sending (i) lots of small data
packets on demand or (ii) occasional large ones and hoping the scheduling
is roughly optimal.

(1) A history mechanism on the console. I hate pressing the UP arrow and
getting ^[[A instead of the previous command.

(2) I often get pvm system errors when I start up or try to add new
machines.  Usually I find that a pvm daemon has started on the slave
machine and failed to communicate this to the master.  If I kill the daemon
by hand, I can then add the slave. This fault is not because I have some
text echoed by my .bashrc file.

Following message from P.J. Spence  (jules@rrpmg.demon.co.uk) in response to PVM
survey request received by me, D R Crooke, presumably as a NA-Net subscriber as
41179@ibmmail.com.

Julian's response follows:


I am using PVM

My application is FORGE3 - a 3D Finite Element forging simulation
(rigid-viscoplastic - i.e. incompressible fluid formulation) using a direct
solver (currently). My work has involved testing the solver (in isolation) on
Silicon Graphics machines; concentrating on using our Challenge machine as the
shared memory makes communications fast enough for speed up. The way forward is
to integrate the solver into the program and distribute the data and sparse
matrix.

I have found that the shared memory PVM on SiG tends to fall over, without
warning, when other users (e.g. Patran3) vie for it - would it be possible for
pvm progs to wait for such contention to finish (and not crash) : also to clean
up the ipcs resources after themselves. The use of the tmp directory for pvm is
irritating as (when it fills up) other progs have problems - perhaps an option
when running pvm that enabled specification of its workspace?
Finally when running parallel programs is it possible easily to run something
like dbx on slave processes or is there some other way of de-bugging these
codes?

Generally pvm is OK the things I have mentioned are more to do with putting
programs into production (and the hoary problem of de-bugging).

Hope I have given you enough information - please contact me if you wish to
discuss my use of pvm.

Hi!

Are you using PVM today?
	Yes, I have been using PVM for about a year.

What are your application(s)?

We have written a distributed implementation of the Finite Difference Time
Domain (FDTD) method  (3 dimensional) for electromagnetic applications.  The
majority of the parallel computation part has been completed.  The code was
written in C and used the SPMD computation model with overlapping regions
at the boundaries.

We are also considering using PVM in our practical exercises for our parallel
computing courses.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

We have been using a combination of 8 SUN iPX, iPC and classic workstations.
We intend to also use a network of DEC alphas with FDDI in the near future.

Comments and Suggestions?

The FDTD project is being funded by the Higher Education Funding Councils of
England, Scotland and Wales as part of a larger project to exploit spare
capacity on workstation networks.  There are about 8 other projects that are
currently using PVM. I believe that the HPC centre at Southampton are
currently constructing a WWW page with details of all ofthe projects.

We are currently using version 2.4.2 having read several reports that indicated
that the performance was superior to version 3.x.

Keep up the good work.

Best Wishes
	Darren.

>What are your application(s)?

I am working with pvm in order to construct a software which calculate the
difference in speckle patterns between two images (speckle photography).
The goal is to get a system which can show tensions and small movements
solid object. How a fluids behaves and similar things.

The calculations is rather, how should I put it? Heavy?
The work is a part of my exam and I have not developed the program from
scratch. The major part of the calculations has been imported from a
program running under a DOS based system. But I, and my companion, has
ported the program to UNIX and delveloped it to a massive parallel working
program. Of course the language in use has been C (GNU c to be exact). We
have been able to cut the time spent computing from 3 hours (66 mh 486) to
about 15 minutes. In some cases even better results have been obtained.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

In the largest installation I have used 25 sun stations of various kinds.
I have also tested installations with mixed environment (HP and sun).
SOme problems arised when using this large installation. I have not yet
been able to deduce if it is my fault, the network or bugs in the used
software (The operating systems is for example different).

I am responding to your survey request.

I am not really using pvm today.  I recently got a copy of the program
installed it and ran pvm_test.  However, I do not know as yet how to
actually use the program (1 st time user).  I knew of the program due
to my advisor at college.

My applications will hopefully be to run some method of moments type
code.

The number of machines I will be using is as yet undetermined. (to be determined
by the amount of time it requires to finish my runs in a reasonable amount of time.)
Most likely 2-6 machines will be used.  I have many more at my diposal, almost all
of which will be sun sparcs (from ipx to 20).

I do not have any suggestions at this time.

I hope this is useful.

3)  I use PVM on a cluster of of 8 HP Risc workstations (HPPA).  I
plan to use it on an IBM SP1 or SP2 in the near future.

2) I have been using PVM as a "baby sitting" program, that is, keeping
the eight workstations busy running essentially serial programs.
These programs have been quantum Monte Carlo simulations for single
electron charging effects, and solution of continuum differential
equations for sutdying growth on surfaces.  I am now developing a
program that will do more fine grained parallelism.  The new program
will entail doing three dimensional integrations, where the integrand
is expensive to compute, but can be computed on a single node.

1) Yes, am using PVM today.

In general pvm is working very well for our application, and we
have little problems using it. 

We have a few problems with portablity:

- the startup code of vendors-implementation works different from
the public domain code 
- when using a virtual machine consisting of for example CRAY and
RS6K machines, a problem arises in communicating integer arrays
since CRAY uses 64 bit integers, and ibm uses 32 bit integers.
The first problem is that INTEGER8 is not supported, and the
second problem is that the integers need to be converted (we would
like to use some general type INTEGER, depending on the machine,
and let pvm manage the required conversions).

Wish list:

Portable startup code (also useable for pvm-e etc)
A simple solution for the 'integer problem'
A fast implementation of the reduce operation
A fast multicast operation (use the network multicast option)
A simple manner to destroy the output from the kids

The max number of machines I have used at once is probably 30.  I've
used HP 7xx's, Sparc 2, 10 and 20's and IBM RS 6000's.  I'm pretty
sure that I've had runs that used all three at once.  Definitly runs with
Sun and HP's.

Hello,

>Are you using PVM today?

Yes.

>What are your application(s)?

Currently I am writing my doctoral thesis about distributed
planning algorithms in multi-agent systems. Especially I am 
working on the problem how to distribute some typical tasks in
manufacturing planning and control. Within this work I developed
a negotiation-based distributed planning method, that I myself implemented in 
a  simulation environement running on one workstation. When I heard about
PVM I gave some of me students the task to do a second test implementation
using PVM in order to test whether this approach is useful in practice.
We are now using this first prototype for experiments with this 
planning system and do further improvements.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

My student used up to 100 HP workstations (HPPA architecture), but mostly
we are using smaller configurations around 40 machines, because they are
also used by other users ;)
But I also tried it on a network containing different architectures
(SUN,HPPA and HP300). 

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

It's a great system. I also did a presentation of our planning system
on a small conference (MAAMAW'94) using a foreign network consisting
of 20 SUN Sparcs without problems. This showed me how portable distributed 
software. 
Only the debugging of the distributed implementations is sometimes not so
easy and it would be nice when there are proper debugging tools available.
One of my students tried xpvm (if I remember correctly), but was not able to
run it. But perhaps there is already a good tool available and I do not know
about it ?

Best wishes and a happy new year,

Hello,

Please, find some remarks on PVM:

1. we use PVM every day for at least 2 years for research and educational 
   purposes. We use also other environments like Express, Linda, p4, NX2.

2. PVM is used for dovelopment of parallel (distributed) algorithms for
   molecular simulation (molecular dynamics, lattice gas, some trials 
   with CFD, parallel FEM, distributed graphics)

3. SUN SPARCstation2, SLC,IPX, 470, 10
   IBM RS/6000 320,520H, 550.....
   HP9000/700 720, 712/80
   CONVEX C3220, C3820
   experiments were done also with TMC CM5

4. Suggestions:
   - global operations similar to Express excombine() or NX2 gdsum(), gopf()
   - more information available via XPVM,  like in ParaGprah for example.

Sincerely yours

We have been able to use PVM in three different parallel programming models;
Hierarchical (Client-Agent-Server), Pipe-Line and Data Parallel.  In each of
these approaches, PVM presents little difficulty in use (design and coding).
While PVM is versatile and generally easy to use, there is room for improved
debugging capabilities.  It would be preferable that changes or improvements
to PVM take into account the variety of parallel programming paradigms that
may be in use.

Dear PVM Project Team,

in respect of your survey I ll give you some information
of the project we are using pvm with.

On our Institution, the Lehrstuhl fuer Werkzeugmaschinen
at the WZL (Werkzeugmaschinenlaboratorium) of the University
in Aachen we are using and developing programms for the
finite-element calculation and optimization (shape & topology) of
mechanical structures (especially of tooling machines).

Beside comercial software for FEM calculation we are using the
self-developed programsystem STRATHOS with is specialized in
the structural and thermal optimization of composites.

The main goal of our research project "Parallelization of FEM-
Optimization" (founded by the German research fund DFG) is to 
speed up calculation time of STRATHOS. We first investigated
domain-decomposition techniques. To speed up the performance
of a single FEM-Analysis we implemented a multi-frontal 
FEM-equitation solver in STRATHOS using pvm as interface. 
Because restructuring the knots with the nested-disection 
method would cost too much time, we are using only two solver 
proceses in connection with up to eight proceses doing the 
calculation of the element matrices in parallel.

Our hardware consists of a workstationcluster of 10 RS/6000 
worstations. Using all 10 workstation, STRATHOS runs nearly
3 times as fast as the sequentiell version, although the other
machines are busy running a CAD-System (CAEDS). We hope to 
improve performance by replacing the file exchange of 
the various modules by communication over pvm, thus kind of 
pipelining the optimization process.

Our overall experience with pvm ist quite good, although there are 
some drawbacks your probably already aware of:
- I do not know a way of doing or controlling either dynamic or 
static load balancing
- There is no way to controll the amount of data that has been 
sendet, but not yet received (-> buffer overflow)
- It is imposible to measure performance, because the blocking
receive operation does not increment the user time counter. So it is 
not possible to tell how long an operation blocked. 

I would like to have a monitor tool (which may of cource cost performance) 
to analyse the overall behavior of the progam system. This is a thing 
that I cannot realize, because of lack in time and knowledge. If you 
got to know about such a tool through your survey, please let me 
know.

Bye, Enno H. Cramer

Dear members of The PVM Project Team:

  First sincerely thank you for providing such 
a useful parallel utility to us.

  Then I answer those three qlestions listed 
in your letter:
  
  1: Of course, I am using PVM today. I will 
try to use it better in future.

  2: My research is in Artificial Neural Networks,
I have built my parallel simulation for ANN with PVM.

  3: Now in my laboratory, we have a SUN Sparc server 
670mp that has two processors, a SUN ELC workstation 
and a Alpha machine which has 16 processors. These machines 
link each other with a ethernet. I built my simulation 
in this environment.

  In my work, sometimes I was bothered by how to getting 
accurate transmission time between two projects run on both 
same and different machines. Maybe I have not found good 
solution to solve it. Can you give me some good suggestion?

  Gest regards,

  WEI Xiao

I want to ask a question in return. What is happening to the standardization
procedure. I guess PVM is a de facto standard right now.

Is it possible for PVM to adopt the idea of Virtual Shared Memory, which shares
Virtual Data Segment throughout the network? And is it worth doing?

We are researching into image processing on parallel and distributed

processing software package that is capable of serial or parallel use,
with PVM being one of the underlying routes to parallelism.  This
software also uses Tcl/Tk, and we have put together something rather
like the PVM console as an extension verb to Tcl; someone out there
might be interested.

From: Xiao Xu <xiaoxu@aero.gla.ac.uk>

Dear Colleague,

I use PVM every day recently. We have a cluster composed of 8 Silicon Graphics
(6 x R4400 & 2 x R4600).
The application is solving 3-D Navier-Stokes equations. The explicit algorithm
has been successful, but the implicit algorithm is still in testing. Since
the only 8 processors available, the cluster is only used for coding the
implicit algorithm. The Cray T3D is also available, which uses PVM, for the
implicit algorithm.

There are two things that I am not happy.
1. The PVM can not load the jobs according to the loading of the processors,
   i.e. lack of load banlance.
2. The job will be stopped if one processor have problem.
   e.g. someone reboot one of the computer, the job will dead.

We are not actively using PVM today, but we plan to use it in the future.

The application is a 3D linear elastic boundary element code.  Both the 
integrations and the solver can be parallelized, but we do not have an 
out-of-core parallel solver, thus we are not actively using it.

We have it running on 4 DEC ALPHA's and 1 DEC Station 5000.

In the class, we used PVM to implement mutual exclusion using several 
different algorithms.  THis was part of the class project to learn more
about the ways distributed operating systems can implement mutual 
exclusion.  It was interesting.

We used XPVM in an attempt to visualize what was happening on the
virtual machine.  XPVM was too slow to actually use for debugging or
executing test runs.  If you could speed up XPVM it would be an
excellent tool.  

PVM as a tool was quite straightforward to use and an excellent
distributed o.s. utility.

PVM Project Team,

Yes we are using PVM extensively and have upgraded to PVM 3.3.5.

It has become an integral part of MCNP 4A and newer versions.  We are
in the process of incorporating load-balancing with this capability.
Hundreds of MCNP users have taken advantage of this on virtually all
Unix platforms, including (to my knowledge) Suns, HPs, IBM RS/6000,
Cray (UNICOS), Cray T3D, Meiko, CM-5, SGI.

To date the most workstations I have performed timing studies on is
16 (on Suns and IBM RS/6000s).  I have also done some studies on the
Cray T3D with 128 processors.

I have found the PVM software to be one of the most reliable utilities
I've used.  Continue the good work!

   What are your application(s)?
1) client/compute-server communication.
2) (intended) portable message passing for migrating various CMMD codes
from CM-5 to other parallel supercomputers.
   How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
Have used SGI5,CM5 as a client/server pair.
Intend to use CM5, SGI, IBM and CRAY multiprocessing.
   Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
I was surprised by the poor performance I got by coding a client/server
system so that the server blindly sent messages and the client read them
when ready.  I got much better performance by having the clinet request
each message.  Perhaps I just need a better model of PVM internals in order
to understand this behavior, but it would be nice if the simpler protocol
were more efficient.

I used it in a course on parallel programming that I taught during
the Fall 94 semester.  The students wrote one program (Gauss-Jordan
Elimination).

See above.

> 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

We installed PVM on a set of 8 HP400 workstations.

> 
> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Installation was more painful than we had hoped.  I had been using 
PVM on a set of Suns.  I had hoped to be able to set up the HP
environment also so I could see what types of issues the students
would face.  But I gave up trying to set up my system to also
allow the use of PVM across the HPs.  We have a global shared file system
across all department machines.  When I tried to install the HP
version, my Sun version died.  

It seemed difficult to get the environment variables set up correctly,
and the specification of where parts of PVM had to reside in the file
system seemed restrictive.

The students kept their sense of humor reasonably well. A couple
energetic ones started working on their assignments early and provided
valuable hints for helping the rest of the students to get their
environments/directories set up properly.

Our customers want to PVM across J90s without any load balancing problems etc.
Also, our customers want a shared memory version of PVM on the PVP CRI
machines.

My personal opinion about the PVM on the PVP machines is that is a potential
customer coming off a cluster of workstations tries it, he will probably not
buy the PVP from CRI. When I was using it, I could not spawn from the pvm
console and I had to start the group server myself. THis is a CRI problem
and should not be telling this to you.

Currently,i.e we have not used PVM today.

We have installed PVM on our SUN stations (Sparc 1 and 2).  
We hope to install PVM also on a PC using GNU-LINUX.

We would like to create some applications which should eventually 
run on IBM  (SP1 with 8 nodes) machines for the study of mechanics 
of continuous media using the finite element method. 

We currently have a project (thesis for a French Diplome) on the 
parellisation of a numerical solver using sparse matrices. 
The numerical programme was created by the French Highways and Roads 
Department for aid in modellising problems in the civil engineering domain.

	I tried to use PVM 3.3 with XPVM on SGIMP but, as Jim Kohl told
me, instrumentation of SGIMP is still to be done. I wish I could have
it for the next release.

	I'd greatly appreciate to have the same version of PVM on
workstation *AND* the CRAY T3D. I do know that's not easy since CRAY
wants to have it's own improved version but that would help us a lot.
Maybe some common programming efforts could solve this ?

Commercial multiprocessing applications on large SMP/NUMA machines and on
clusters of UNIX servers.   It would be nice if a user could configure
his PVM application so that part of it runs within a NUMA machine (with
appropriate CPU affinity) and part runs across a cluster of such machines.  
The runtime decision would depend on the availability of machine resources 
and on the desired degree of high availability.  If it doesn't already, 
it would be nice if PVM were cluster-aware and had some hooks related to high
availability (e.g., initiating recovery after node failure).  There are
no standards in the clusters space.  There is an opportunity for someone
to define a standard way of doing message-passing, distributed locking, and 
application start/stop/recovery within a cluster environment.  If the standard 
also runs on a NUMA without changing application code, even better.

Georgia Tech officially has PVM installed on a cluster of three RS/6000's, a
Cray YMP-EL, and a KSR-2 (although the last is not installed to utilize
multiple processors unless the user's task does so explicitly).  We have
recently added an SP/2 which will use PVM as its main library for
parallelization.  I have worked on all of these machines as well as on some
unofficial installations on SUN4 architectures.  For my personal use, I have
installed it on a pair of 486-DX/2-66's running LINUX (and encountered no
significant problems in doing so).

          I set up PVM to be used for running MCNP (Monte Carlo
          N-Particle transport code) on multiple SUN4 type
          workstations.  This implementation of MCNP-PVM was set up as
          a back-up for running MCNP on lower powered desktop
          workstations (SUN elc, slc, ipx, ... up to SPARC 2
          technology) in parallel when the higher powered servers are
          unavailable.  I have used up to six of these workstations at
          a time.

          I am not aware of anyone using PVM recently,
          but with some rummored changes in charge rates for server
          use, it may come into more extensive use in the near future.

Could there please be some mechanism for polling on a partial subset of
connected processes?  For example, I have an application where the
parent (a manager) sends out work to child processes.  Before accepting
any new messages from the parent of the manager, the manager must first
drain a "reply" message from the child (ie. send work only to idle
workers).  I can block on a child or all processes or on a message type
or all message types.  I need to be able to block (not busy wait
either!!!) on a *selected* sublist of processes.  My current solution
(a modification of busy wait) is to insert a usleep after the polling
call.  The interval of the usleep progressively grows to some
predetermined value.  After getting a message, the interval is reset to 1.

A poll or block on a sublist of processes would be really nice!

Are you using PVM today?

       Not regularly, but have tried some tests on networked SUN stations.

What are your application(s)?
	I am lookin for a program standard interface to allow the development of parallel programs which have some capability of being ported accross platforms. I am using 16 to 48 Transputer and PowerPC processors and have developed our own communications harness. This works great but is not compatible with anyone else. I am tired of rewriting the application for every new version of hardware. So my interrest in PVM is as a potential parallel programming standard. 
      I would like to be able to write the same application as a multi task configuration in a single processor or as a multitask program in multiple processors without rewriting a lot.

We are not currently using PVM but this is more do to lack

PVM Survey,

	The following response is copied from my response to the 1993 survey,  
e-mailed to you on 16 August 1993.  Unfortunately, the situation has not  
changed.

	No, I am not using PVM today.
	My potential future PVM application is in simulation of underwater  
sound.  The current version is the Sonar Simulation Toolset.  It produces  
sampled sound as "heard" by a user-specified moving multi-channel active or  
passive sonar system in a specified ocean containing any number of moving  
targets (sound reflectors) and sound sources, plus reverberation, ambient  
noise, and self-noise.  The resulting sound is suitable for listening, or for  
feeding to the back end of a sonar processor (or a computer model of one).  It  
is used for testing and developing sonar systems, training sonar operators,  
predicting performance, developing tactics, planning experiments, and  
interpreting measurements.  Reference (out of date): Proc. Oceans 89, IEEE  
Publication 89CH2780-5, pp. 1217-1222.
	I anticipate using a mix of a dozen or so Sun-4 and NeXT computers, and  
whatever else is available at that uncertain future date, if and when I use PVM  
at all.
	I downloaded PVM 3.0 from netlib@ornl.gov on 27 April 1993, after  
reading Dongarra et al., "Integrated PVM Framework Supports Heterogeneous  
Network Computing", Computers In Physics 7 #2, Mar/Apr 1993, 166-175.  My  
motivation was mostly curiosity, to find out whether PVM has the potential to  
help me satisfy my very substantial computational requirements.  Since then, I  
haven't had time to pursue the question further.

PVM is one of serveral message-passing systems in our codes. The
codes are used by several people on different platforms, but I believe
PVM is mainly used on vector-parallel CRAYs, workstations and
to a certain extend on CRAY T3D and Intel Paragon (but here SHMEM (T3D)
and NX (Paragon) are used most of the time).

	I have ported PGS Tensor's Cube Manager Software Suite from
the Intel i860/Paragon message passing paradim to PVM. We are currently
using the PVM version on 2 SP2's. The following breifly describes our software
package. This overview relates to the i860, but the model is the same for
the PVM version.

                     CUBE MANAGER OVERVIEW 
                     ---------------------
                     
 
     The Cube Manager (CM) is a 3D seismic data processing system 
designed to run on a MIMD parallel supercomputer.  It controls
the flow of seismic data from tape or disk through a sequence of
2 or 3D seismic processes, which may take place in separate pro-
cessing nodes of the parallel computer, returning the results
back to tape or disk.  The hardware configuration consists of a
workstation network connected to the parallel computer through
its resource manager which in turn is connected to the individual
processing nodes by internal hardware links.  The general archi-
tectural philosophy of the CM is to try and hide the complexities
of the parallel computer from the user and programmer by means 
of a combination of parallel data structures and a parallel tool-
kit.  Major software components of the system are: an operator 
GUI (CMJC for Cube Manager Job Control), a user GUI (CMUI for
Cube Manager User Interface), and subsections of the CM which 
run on the attached workstations, the resource manager, and in 
the processing nodes.
 
     The MIMD parallel supercomputer currently used is the iPSC/860 
supplied by the SSD division of Intel Corporation.  This machine is
configured with up to 128 processor nodes, an internal parallel
disc system known as the Concurrent File System (CFS), and 8mm SCSI
tape drives.  Any subset of compute nodes must be a power of two 
and is called a "cube" because of the machine's hypercube architec-
ture.  The CM can be booted in any size cube.  It further divides
the cube into individual job partitions which may be any size.
The CM software is general enough to be adapted to other MIMD 
parallel computers as well as to the computational requirements 
of other data-intensive endeavors.

     The iPSC/860 is interfaced to the network of workstations by
ethernet.  One workstation in the network is designated the host
(or server) for the iPSC/860 and contains system utility soft-
ware such as compilers and linkers.  A separate dedicated work-
station is the system resource manager (SRM) which serves as the
gateway to the system.  The SRM is provided by Intel and runs a
stripped-down version of Unix.  Its sole function is to manage
cubes of compute nodes on the iPSC/860.  There are two special
nodes within the iPSC/860 system itself, the Ethernet and service
nodes.  The Ethernet node is connected to the workstation network
and allows network file operations to be performed on the CFS.  The
service node is a scalar processor which facilitates non-floating
point tasks which would otherwise consume a compute node.

     The iPSC/860 supports both 3480 IBM-compatible cartridge tape 
drives and 8mm exabyte tape drives.  In general, all Tensor inter-
nal data resides on exabyte 8200 or 8500 tapes.  The cartridge 
drives are used for the input and output of external data tapes.
Electrostatic plotting is done via third party Geoscan software
that rasters data on an Intel node.  Seismic programs, known in the
CM system as Procedures, generate plot metafiles on the Intel disc.
The format of these metafiles is an internal vector drafting format.
Geoscan plotting software is then used to raster the plot metafile
on the Intel and the operator spools the rastered data to the ap-
propriate electrostatic plotter.  Data can also be directly dis-
played on the users workstation screen using the XPLOT interactive 
procedure without having to generate a plot metafile.
 
     The Intel iPSC/860 features a parallel diskfile system known
as the Concurrent File System (CFS).  It consists of multiple disk 
drives which are typically 1.5 Gbytes in capacity.  These multiple 
disk drives are made to look like one very large contiguous disk-
file by the CFS software.  Individual CFS files are striped across
the constituent disks in the file system.  Therefore, the user does
not have to be concerned on which physical disk their data resides.
All data files are readable and writeable by all nodes in the sys-
tem.
 
     In general, the local diskfile systems resident on one work-
station are cross-mounted on all the other workstations on the net-
work.  This allows a user access to any file on any of the cross-
mounted file systems.  File system cross-mounting is accomplished 
by the Network File System (NFS) software.
 
     The Intel CFS diskfile system is not, however, cross-mounted 
with either the workstation NFS network or with the CFS systems on
other Intel machines.  This means that the Sun workstation user 
cannot directly access diskfiles on the Intel CFS from his worksta-
tion.  It also means that if a user wishes to use a CFS dataset in
a job on another Intel computer, the dataset must first be trans-
ferred to the other Intel CFS by means of tar tape backup or the
File Transfer Protocal (FTP) procedure.  In order to allow the user
a means of managing their own data on the Intel CFS disfile system, 
there are three procedures; CFSLST, CFSDEL and CFSTAR that allow 
the user to list, delete and backup files by CM jobs setup via CMUI.

     The Cube Manager software itself consists of several Unix dae-
mons which run in the various hardware components of the iPSC/860.
Three of these: the synchronizer, logger, and log formatter run on 
the service node.  The Executive Shell daemon runs in each proces-
sing node.  It is the part of the Cube Manager which ties processes 
together into jobs.  Two daemons run on the SRM: the linker and 
loader.  Finally, the operator and user interfaces: CMJC and CMUI, 
the CM kernel itself, a linker, and the data base daemons run on 
the front end Sun workstation.  All of these daemons are in commu-
nication with each other and cooperate to interface with the oper-
ator and users, build executable code images, initiate job execu-
tion, monitor jobs, collect the log messages and present them to 
the user after job termination.  Clearly this is a complicated sys-
tem!  To understand it, let us "walk" a job through the whole se-
quence.

     The user builds a seismic job flow interactively on his local 
Sun workstation via CMUI.  This job flow can then be either sub-
mitted directly by the user from CMUI for interactive execution
or given to the Intel operator in the computer room who submits it
by means of CMJC.  If it involves tape mounts or if it can be run 
later as a batch job, then the operator route is more convenient.  
The CM kernel on the Sun receives the job and breaks it down into 
its components.  It looks around on the host Sun disks for old exe-
cutables that have the required seismic processes embedded in them.  
If it can reuse old execuables it does; otherwise, it proceeds to 
build new executable images with the specified seismic processes 
for execution in the nodes.  So far, everything has happened on 
the front end Sun network.  The CM kernel then loads the executa-
ble images, along with the resident Executive Shell into the nodes 
by using the loader daemon in the SRM.  Communication between the 
Sun host and the SRM is handled by the pair of linker daemons: one
in the Sun and the other in the SRM.  The CM initializes the log-
ger daemon in the service node.

     At this point everything is ready to run; however, in order
to verify the whole software environment, the CM firsts sends a
round robin message to the compute nodes and waits for its return.
If all is well, the CM starts the job executing.  During execution,
the two linker, and synchronizer daemons are available to the job 
for utility functions.  Log messages output from the job or the CM 
are accumulated by the logger daemon.  At the finish of job execu-
tion, the CM uses the log formatter daemon to sort the log mes-
sages into chronological order and write the resulting CM execu-
tion log back to the front end Sun disk.  Information concerning
tape datasets created or modified is kept track of by the data base 
daemon.

     Before discussing the various components of the CM in detail,
we should first mention "namespaces" which are the glue that holds
everything together.  A namespace is a tree-type data structure
on which is hung information.  Like a tree, a namespace has a root
where it begins and a series of branches whose intersections are
given simple names.  The leaves or fruit of the namespace tree are
the data names and their values.  So a namespace data structure
consists of four major items: the tree structure, the intersection
names, the data names, and the actual data values.  Namespaces can
reside in memory as tree structures or be condensed to a form suit-
able for storage on disk or for transmission to other hosts or CM
nodes.  On disk they can be viewed on the screen by use of the 
utility: "nscat".  Namespaces can be concatenated, split, or pruned
to make other namespaces as the need may arise.

     The highest level of the CM is managed by the GUI: CMJC for
Cube Manager Job Control.  It oversees all of the software that 
runs in (is "booted" in) an Intel iPSC/860 cube.  Usually the CMJC 
cube is booted in the computer room on the host workstation and is 
controlled or managed by the computer operator.  However, for test-
ing or special work, a user may boot his own cube on his worksta-
tion which will communicate with the host workstation over the lo-
cal network.  In this case a CMJM display will appear on his work-
station screen and the user will have complete control over all 
jobs running under his cube.  In either case, the cube is described 
by the "master namespace" which is a concatenation of all the indi-
vidual job namespaces that are running under the cube.  

     The CMJC GUI has four classes of functions: Jobs, Nodes, No-
tices, and Namespace.  The Jobs function allows the operator to:
Check, Start, Abort, or Kill individual jobs.  Batch jobs are han-
dled with this function as well as user jobs that are hung or im-
properly terminated.  The Nodes function allows the operator to
Enable, Disable, or Inquire nodes in the cube.  Usually, hardware
problems with nodes require the operator to intervene with this
function.  The Notices functions: Respond and Delete, provide a
mechanism for the operator to communicate with jobs requiring some
action such as a tape mount or plotting a file on the electrosta-
tic plotter.  The last function: Namespsace allows the operator to
Browse, Set, or Print the master namespace.  Browse is a means of
navigating through the master namespace and its constituent job 
components by listing on the screen the data values at each inter-
section.  The operator (or user) can probe down to any level in
order to monitor job progression and performance.

     The primary tool for the user to interact with the CM is the
GUI CMUI.  This can be considered a user-orientated window into the
cube managed by a CMJC GUI.  The user can construct CM jobs from
several dozen CM procedures, submit them, abort or kill them, and
monitor their performance.  The user cannot control individual nodes,
respond to messages, or browse other job's namespaces.  The job flow
is built by either editing an existing job or by selecting procedures 
from a list of procedures displayed in a window on the lhs of the
CMUI display.  Each procedure is selected by clicking the mouse on 
its procedure name.  It then appears as a white box in the job build
part of the display with the name of the procedure inside.
 
     Each procedure is parameterised by clicking the right mouse 
button on the white box of the procedure.  This will simultaneously 
list the parameters required by the procedure and, below, general 
documentation for the procedure's function.  The user then selects 
parameters for input by clicking with the left mouse button.  Par-
ameter description is automatically presented for that parameter in 
a documentation window.  The parameter values are then typed into a 
parameter input window.  A set of red control buttons appear which 
allow the user to delete, set defaults, and repeat parameters for 
the procedure.
 
     Once all the procedures for a job have been parameterised, the 
job can be saved to disk under a user-specified name, and then sub-
mitted either directly from CMUI or given indirectly to the Intel com-
puter operator.  Usually jobs with more than one input tape or that
produce an output tape are submitted by the Intel computer operator. 
When a job flow is saved, it is saved as a namespace disc file under
a user-specified name.  The ".job" filename extension is supplied by 
(or assumed by) CMUI.  All job files are saved in the "/job" sub-
directory under the user's project directory.  

     In order to understand the project filesystem we must first 
digress a bit.  Before jobs can be submitted, the user must have a
CM user project account in both the workstation "/tensordb" and 
Intel CFS filesystems.  Usually, only CM data will be written to the
CFS.  However, the "/tensordb/project" directory contains five sub-
directories which perform vital CM functions.  They are: "/job",
"/log", "/db", "/plot", and "/prog".  All ".job" files for the pro-
ject are are stored in "/job".  All CM logger files are returned to 
the "/log" subdirectory.  They have a ".log" filename extension.  The
"/db" subdirectory contains data base files describing input and 
output data resident in the "/cfs/project" filesystem.  Other data 
base information stored in the "/db" directory includes CDP grid 
definition files for 3-D surveys that have a ".grid" file exten-
sion and SEGD header files that have a ".sdb" file extension.
Plot files created by raster procedures on the Intel will be re-
turned to the "/plot" subdirectory.  Finally, nonstandard CM pro-
cedure objects are stored in the "/prog" subdirectory.
 
     If a job generates a plot metafile, this file is stored under 
the "/cfs/geoscan" directory as a filename which is based on the 
".job" filename that created it.  Presently, plots are manually 
queued for plotting by the operator.

     Programmers and software support personnel typically operate 
under a personal project name such as /tensordb/david and /cfs/david, 
while production groups setup a project for a survey and all pro-
cessors working on that survey work in the same project directory.  
Project directories are usually setup and managed by the system ad-
ministrator.
 
     For example, a job constructed using CMUI that is created for
the project: "Olayoil" is given the name "stack". This job outputs 
a disc dataset called "finalstack" and a tape dataset called
"gathers".  For this job, the following files will be generated:
 

Directory              FileName         Format     Comments
---------              --------         ------     --------
 
/tensordb/Olayoil/job  stack.job        namespace  Job flow file created
                                                   by CMUI.
                                                 
/tensordb/Olayoil/log  stack.log        ascii      Runtime log for stack.job
 
/tensordb/Olayoil/db   finalstack.cmds  namespace  Dataset summary file for
                                                   CFS dataset 'finalstack'.
 
/tensordb/Olayoil/db   gathers.cmds     namespace  Dataset summary file for 
                                                   tape dataset 'gathers'.
 
/cfs/Olayoil           finalstack       binary     Seismic data for dataset
                                                   'finalstack' 
 
 

     The remaining chapters in the CM Programmer's Guide that 
follow cover all the items we have alluded to above with our
overview in considerable detail.  These fall into, roughly, four 
categories: functional descriptions of the CM software elements, 
dataset formats, operational instruction, and general philosophy.  
Chapters 2 (Creating the Namespace Descriptor file), 3 Creating 
the Run-Time Code), 5 (The Synchronizer and its Services), and 7 
(Special Libraries) fall into the first category.  Chapter 4 
(Data Structures) forms the second category.  Chapters 8 (Special 
Procedures), 9 (Testing, Debugging, and Releasing Procedures), 
and 12 (Tutorial) make up the instruction or third category.
Lastly, Chapters 6 (Namespaces), 10 (Aspects of Parallism), and
11 (Future Directions) provide the philosophical framework of
the whole system.  

     We had considered adding a thirteenth Chapter with exercis-
es for the student-user but that number was judged to be unlucky 
and, therefore, a chapter unlikely to be read.  Upon reflection, 
twelve Chapters of detailed description should be plenty!  If 
anyone works their way through the whole Guide and wants more,
they can start again at the Overview and will be amazed at what
they have forgotten since starting.  The Cube Manager (CM) is a 
3D seismic data processing system.....

Not at the present.
 
> What are your application(s)?

When I did use PVM, I was using a ray-traced computer graphics program
that I had written.  In such programs, each pixel of an image must be
computed independently by intersecting a ray sent from the 'eye' to the
pixel and on into the 3-D 'environment' or 'world'.  There can be
reflection/refraction and other rays, and the calculations take quite
some time (hours for some images).
  So I had a 'master' program spawn 10 'slaves' on 10 HP-700
workstations.  Each slave would ask the master for one line of the image
to work on, until all the lines of the image were calculated, at which
point the master killed all the slaves and saved out the final image.
 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

Like I said above, I used 10 HP Workstations of a few different kinds.
Two were HP-718i (I think), and the others were HP-700's.  All ran the
same binaries, though at different speeds.

Regarding this PVM survey below,

_________________________________________________________

Dear Colleague,
In order to improve PVM we are trying to understand how
people are using the system. Your feedback is important.
Could you take a moment to answer three questions.

Are you using PVM today?

   Yes, I have been using PVM pretty much
   continuously for almost a year now.

What are your application(s)?

   My application is in astrophysical magnetohydro-
   dynamics.  I am solving the induction equation
   for the magnetic field in the presence of a
   prescribed fluid flow.  I distribute the angular
   modes of the field over the various processors,
   and use PVM to implement the coupling between
   modes.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

   Mostly the T3D here at the Los Alamos Advanced
   Computing Lab, also a cluster of workstations,
   when I was still in the development and testing
   stage.

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
Please email the information to pvm-survey@cs.utk.edu.

   As far as I'm concerned, PVM is just about ideal
   as it is.  I was particularly impressed at how
   easy it was to port my code from the workstation
   cluster to the T3D.  It took me about half a day,
   no more, to implement the few changes in the PVM
   calls.

      on both the IBM RISC 6000 cluster and now on the SP2 i have
      encountered a tendency for either my code or PVM to hang up and
      not return. while i know it is possible that this could be due to
      a bug causing a timing error in my program i have a gut-level
      feeling that it is some interaction of PVM itself with the
      system. in the case of the RS6000's the problem started on one
      particular day and persisted for over a month only to disappear
      completely when the system was taken down for maintenance.  but i
      was, apparently, the only person who encountered any difficulty
      during that period. i think that i was not aggressive enough in
      pursuing clues to the problem.  instead, i spent the month
      tweaking my program to see if i could make it run.  but i did try
      reading those pvml.nnnnn logs and found them very unhelpful
      although they sometimes contained amusing messages like "the mad
      fools.  when will they learn?" i guess it might have been helpful
      if there was more actual English in those logs.

      the funny thing is that PVM went up most easily and ran with the
      fewest problems on the network of SUN workstations where I
      installed it myself. not sure what that means.

We have plans to support Deterministic Replay that would
help developers debug their parallel programs by enabling
them to replicate the behavior of previous runs. The race
condition that exists between pvm_send and pvm_mcast in 
the current implementation of PVM forces us to trace all
messages between tasks. If this race condition is fixed,
it would make our implementation of Deterministic Replay
for more usable.

We feel that supporting asynchronous notification of incoming
messages would be a useful feature.

Thanks.

        Reply to:   RE>PVM survey

Dear PVM,

I AM currently using PVM.  It is, in fact, critical to my work.

I am developing a portable, distributed computing environment, with
application to modeling experiments in the field of high-temperature plasma
spectroscopy.  This work will be appearing in a forthcoming article in the
Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer as:  "The
Development of a Distributed Computing Environment for the Design and Modeling
of Plasma Spectroscopy Experiments", by J.K. Nash et al.  I am dependent on
the ability of PVM for dynamic spawning and process communication on multiple
architectures and on its ability to work in an X Windows interrupt-driven
environment.  We will also be accessing distributed data archives for
substantial amounts of atomic physics data, so data transfer rate is an issue.

We are currently developing on SUN and SGI workstations.  We will shortly be
including HP and IBM workstations.

I was very pleased at how simple and free of complications it was to install
PVM on the SUN and SGI machines.  I have not yet attempted data transfer at
full scale; I have some concerns, (albeit unjustified) as to data transfer
rate.

CONCERNS:
I also have concern regarding the ability of PVM to establish communications
between different machines.  First, it seems that when my home directory is
NFS mounted, (we have a network of SGI machines sharing disk), that I can only
use one SGI in my virtual machine.  This may be resolvable in the current PVM
implementation - I do not know.

Second, on the SGI network, the system message sent out on login contains
'echo' statements which I cannot have removed.  This is not the case for my
SUN system.  The documentation warns of problems with PVM in such cases.  I
may have those problems since it seems that I can start PVM from the SGI and
connect to the SUN, but not vice-versa (I may have this reversed, I can live
with this so I haven't documented it yet).

Third, I will want PVM to provide the communications for a general data server
- i.e. for more than one virtual machine.  I think this is possible with the
existing system using "groups" but I haven't explored this yet.  I have two
uncertainties about the ability of PVM to provide such service in a general
way:  i) will I be able to use "groups" to allow the database to connect and
disconnect from multiple virtual machines?  ii) will it be necessary to
provide an entry in my .hosts file for every such user?   I want a general
capability, without the need to know the names of users before they connect.

Last, I know my system administrators are uncomfortable with the use of the
.hosts file.  I would prefer some additional way to provide connectivity.

I am a physicist with only two years experience with UNIX systems and my
project involves many area besides PVM.  I have not, therefore fully
researched these concerns.  It may be that my answers lie in further exploring
the "group" capabilities of PVM - or that I need to explore UNIX systems
further.  Since you requested comments, I have replied!

Let me conclude with the point that PVM has worked SO well, with little
investment on my part, that I have been content to postpone addressing the
above issues.  If someone has an opportunity to help answer these questions, I
would be most grateful.

	We have a file server that all our workstations use.  Therefore,
we can't use the HP's and the Vaxstations in the same virtual machine.
It would be nice if we could use all of our machines.

	Is there a debugger for pvm?  I have a grad student that is
interested in creating a parallel object oriented debugger.

PVM survey

Are you using PVM today?

A program using PVM was completed in August 1994 as part of a Master's
thesis by a student who has since left MIT.  The program is still used.

What are your application(s)?

We had previous produced a system for robustly calculating regions of
specified curvature in a Bezier (bivariate parametric) surface using
a newly developed interval-based equation solver.  To generalize the
problem, this was modified to work for B-spline surfaces.  The program
works by subdividing the B-spline into its constituent Bezier patches,
calculating regions for each patch and then recombining them.  Each
Bezier patch is worked on as an autonomous process, using PVM to
coordinate and schedule the processes on multiple machines.

How many and what kind of machines have used with PVM?

We have run our program using PVM with one to eight machines, all Silicon
Graphics workstations, a mixture of Personal IRIS 4D-25, 4D-35, 4D-120,
Indigo2, and Indy.

Hi!

I've used PVM for one semester for my project and research.  

I was very impressed for the easy learning curve of PVM.  

PVM is a powerful tool for curcurrent programming.

But, I feel some of PVM features should be improved.  

First, communication speed is slow when I use PVM_SEND and PVM_RECV.

That means, more you communicate more you will be slow down your program.

When I used PVM for an image compression techniques, I measured that the program with PVM is slower

than program with normal C language.  

Since many people like me use PVM for parallel computing platforms, communication speed is critical for 

those projects.



I hope great success in your PVM project.  Thank You for PVM

From: Jean Lorre <jjl@telescope.JPL.NASA.GOV>

We used PVM initially, then converted to RPC's because the latter didn't 
require any delivery of software to our customers, at least that was the 
excuse our systems people used.

The application was to have many platforms refer to a single data base on 
one sun. It was a spacecraft navigation data base which any user could 
update or read from. 

The machines were sun-4 solaris vax-vms alpha-vms sgi and hp

I found pvm very easy to use and rpc's impossible to understand. An 
expert had to be called in to convert to rpc's. I'm an applications guy 
and take no interest in screwing with the operating system. Thanks for a 
nice product. Too bat we didn't keep using pvm.

uses the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina developed Spice like circuit
analysis program CAZM where the "devices" are membrane segments and the 
current-voltage relationships are from the biological literature.  These models
need to have 100,000 to 1,000,000 or more nodes to be useful and are both memory
and computation intensive.

		another Alpha
		IBM RS6000

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

It would be helpful to me if you know someone who has ported CAZM to PVM and 
also how well such programs (i.e. Spice) work in the PVM environment.

> Are you using PVM today?

Although I have downloaded PVM, I have not had a chance to use it yet.
 
> What are your application(s)?

The initial reason for downloading PVM was for running distributed ray-tracing,
namely POV-ray.  However, there is also a desire to have a distributed MPEG
encoding and decoding system.  I also want to implement a distributed fractal
video compressor as part of my master's thesis.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

The majority of machines will be SUN SPARC 2, SPARC 5, and SPARC 10 uniprocessor
systems.  Depending on avaliability, there may also be a large number of 
DEC 125? systems (with MIPS R3000 processors).

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

The one feature that I would like to see implemented would be the use of the 
'speed' field when assigning hosts.  The actual values used would be a metric
dependant on the application being run, but if there were some benchmark values
given for common architectures, it would avoid the need for storing separate
initialization files.  The application could then scale its values to give
approximately the standard value.

Ideally, one should be able to modify this value while running to take into
account load conditions, and possibly network transmission time.  The load
and transmission time should probably be kept as separate values, since a fast
machine at a distant location should actually get larger chunks to process,
to reduce the transmission lag.

One other thing that comes to mind is if it is possibleto distribute a 'C' only
library, since nobody uses the Fortran library here, and I have spent some
time taking out the fortran parts of the code.

My apologies if any of this has already been implemented, since I haven't used
the library yet.  This is only based on a preliminary look.  Otherwise, it 
looks very useful, and it will save me lots of effort in making distributed 
code.  Have a happy new year.

We call PVM from an "MPI-like" library of generic message passing
calls.  This library can call the actual message passing calls of
Intel, PICL, PVM, CM5, and null (serial).

Here are answers to your questions in your PVM survey:

Q:
      Are you using PVM today?
A:
      Yes, I am using PVM today
Q:
      What are your application(s)?
A:  
      Large three-dimensional radiative-transfer finite-element Fortran
      code.
Q:
      How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
A:
      Used PVM to run the code in parallel in a cluster of workstations.
      Workstations include multiprocessor SUN SPARC, SGI's (4D-series, 
      Crimson) and IBM RS/6000.

Additional comments and suggestions:

      1- Need more types of data in PVMFPACK, ect...
         Important data types for scientific (particularly, engineering
         and numerical analysis) Fortran applications include 
         DOUBLE-PRECISION real and integer numbers, COMPLEX numbers, and
         LOGICAL and CHARACTER variables. 

      2- Need timing subroutines to be used in Fortran and C programs.
         Now, there are difficulties in evaluating accurately run times
         of applications in different processors or workstations.

      3- Put more features in XPVM.

From: "Anthony P. Leclerc" <leclerc@tony.cs.cofc.edu>

Currently, I'm not using PVM.  However, last semester, I used PVM in
my Parallel Processing class.  We used it on a distributed network
of Ultrix Workstations.  My original plan was to use the Intel Paragon
at the University of South Carolina, but this fell through.

The applications I run are simple labs (Simpson's rule for integration for
example).  However, I have written a parallel global optimization solver.
I wrote this to work on a distributed network of UNIX workstations using
sockets.  I will be re-writing using PVM, and hopefully implement it on
the Intel Paragon.

I enjoyed using PVM.

A question for you:  If I use PVM for the parallel communication part of
my parallel algorithm, can I market it, or do I owe you something, or can
I even do this.  If not, I will be "cleaning up" my socket code.  I hate
other people having there hands in what I write.  Understandably, however,
I see that you may want a share or whatever.

Around here, people were waiting for the SP/1 version (using the switch)
to come out in version 3.x.  I have sort of lost touch with how that is 
going.

The main thing I found frustrating was the difficulty of running
applications from arbitrary places; PVM was extremely balky about
running things from anywhere except a pathname that was hardwired
into the thing at compile time.

We are using PVM to develop distributed/parallel algorithms to calculate

Network of Sun Sparcstations (~8 machines), SparcCenter (6 nodes).

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

A previous engineer on the project reported trouble in implementing the
shared-memory version of PVM on our SparcCenter.  I do not know if this was
a PVM problem, or if it has been fixed by later versions of PVM.

PVM has been very helpful in our development!  We hope it will continue to
be as we move to multicomputer implementations of our algorithms.

One suggestion: it would be useful to have timing or load balancing functions
to include in applications.  I recently went through an analysis of an 
algorithm we were developing where I had to insert UNIX timing calls and
print them to a file, then develop my own load balancing heuristics.

Since these things are commonly done in a parallel environment, it might
be useful to include them as a toolkit to PVM.  Functions that will 
"measure" network latency or processor speed would make it easier to 
*efficiently* port applications to environments with varying performance 
characteristics.

A programmer could include these functions to "measure" the environment when 
an application begins, then make load distribution decisions using these 
measurements.  This seems like a common enough problem.

MPI allows one to create datastructures to send and has more
diverse broadcasting ( according to standard).  I really like
the ability to send my own data structures over going through
the data bytes and re-storing into a structure. Granted the
creation of datastructures in MPI is not that straight forward.

Greater explanation of the Message passing system would be lovely.
Detailed examples (and accompanying explanations) on passing messages 
from several tasks would be of great help.
 Also.. your discussion on the Resource mamager is minimal. I would
like to know exactly what to expect from the Virtual Machine using
the Resource Manager. Eg - What is a acceptable system load on a machine 
before the RM decides no to schedule a task to it? Is the task somehow
made 'nice' for machines with small enough loads?

  XPVM (under 3.3.6) is a great tool, but it is taking a lot of resources
(tk/tcl overhead?). Also, when building `space-time' and `utilization' views
from a trace file, it is surprising slow (on a SS10), (un-)zooming features
are also slow. I haven't yet found any documentation on pvmgs, that I suspect
is the tool that generates the trace file. It would be nice to be able to
generate a trace file w/out starting XPVM, and later analyze w/ XPVM that
trace file.

My first involvement with PVM was last year at the QUEEN MARY & WESTFIELD
COLLEGE of LONDON UNIVERSITY, England. Over there, I installed PVM and used
it as the tool to implement a dissertation project.
This year I installed PVM at the network at ATHENS UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF
INFORMATICS, Greece and did a couple of lectures about it. I don't know about
QMW COLLEGE, but here in Athens people are going to be using it a lot within
the following months.
 
> What are your application(s)?

At QMW I implemented a theoretical model called SAPS (Self Adaptive Parallel
Servers) intended for parallel MPI hardware. The outcome is a software platform
that provides two types of user interfaces and a load balancing scheme:

  i) there is a C API for programmers who wish to develop services that can
     parallelize requests and achive speedup by using worker workstations.
     The SAPS system automates request decomposition and assignment of
     work fragments to workers (this also includes data send & receive).
     A service program must comply to the SPMD model as it is an application
     spawn over a number of workstations.

 ii) there is a C API for programmers who wish to use already existent services
     by providing a transparent way to find the desired service (by using a
     name service technique) and also transmit the input and collect and patch
     together the output data.

iii) because resourses are not limitless, SAPS is using a given number of
     workstations (pool) and helps already running services share it. It is
     using a load balancing real time aloocation of workers from the pool to
     services always maintaining a uniform workers / task load ratio for
     all services.

At ATHENS UNIVERISTY we are using PVM in order to implement another model
using MPI that can be a system independent framework for parallel application
development (i.e. this has already been finished for a Parcytec GCel machine).
Several students will also take part in this projects by programming modules
of the code as dissertation projects.

At QMW I've used a network of Apple MACs running A/UX, Apple's version of UNIX.
Eventhough I played with the PVM source code, I couldn't get it to communicate
with machines other than MACs as there was a problem with XDR. After that, I
used 8 SUN4 and 2 SGI machines together facing no problems.
At ATHENS UNIVERSITY we have PVM installed and running on a network of SUN4
(25) and a Convex machine connected with 4 powerfull HP workstations via FDDI.

  PVM is slow on the T3D, hence I use the Cray shmem routines.
  This doubles performance. Again on workstation clusters I find
  that best size for my type of problem is 3 to 6 machines.

  I think PVM is an excellent tool and is an essential first
  step for industry wanting to start in parallel computing. The
  reason for this is because the software is public domain and
  runs on their existing hardware.

I used PVM for the last time a few months ago.
The application is CFD. At the moment this is 3D Euler, but the intention for 
the futere is 3D Navier-Stokes. 
The reason why I am not using it today it that I am developing new schemes and 
this takes a while.
I use the Digital ALPHA and I have done some test problems with 4 machines.

compile it on HP workstations (exept for a single-workstation version)

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

A connection of PVM to the MasPar MP-1/2 woud be appreciated. We use PVM
mainly for starting and initializing the master-slave-type algorithm. The
actual data communication is realized via files, which is faster as we have
measured (only one process change instead of two). Moreover this allows to
continue the algorithm after a breakdown.

Dear Colleagues,

we are applying PVM very successfully in VLSI, see
(Schneider, M., Wever, U. Zheng, Q.: Parallel Harmonic Balance.
VLSI Grenoble (1993) ) and (Kleis, U., Wallat, O., Wever, U., Zheng, Q.: Domain Decomposition Methods for Circuit Simulation. Proceedings of for Circuit Simulation. Proceedings of the 8th Workshop 
on Parallel and Distributed Simulation. Edinburgh (1994)).

We are also working on Domain Decomposition methods for
drift diffusion equations in process simulation (dopand diffusion or
point defect simulation).

Most of the time we combine about 10 workstations of the
architectures SUN4 and HPPA (mixed). We do not succeed in combining
the architectures SUN4 and SUNMP (solaris). The solaris processes do not answer. Is there any bug known ?

Finally we want to thank you for your effort in developing
this outstanding software. If one want to be portable, there is
no alternative to PVM.

We have done some preliminary studies, and are about to start on a real
project using PVM.

The application is a Monte Carlo radiation shielding code, called
MCBEND. This tracks neutrons and photons through complex geometries.
Being a Monte Carlo code it can take a long time to get good
statistics.

A customer in the oil well logging field - a big application area for
MCBEND - has installed an IBM supercomputer, made up of 28 IBM RISC
processors. We plan to produce a Parallel MCBEND for them.

We use SUN Microsystems workstations, so we will develop the PVM MCBEND
using our own machines, of which we have a large number, then port it
to the AIX environment.

We have found the recent manual and the whole PVM system easy to use.

PVM survey

Dear PVM Project Team,

I'm using PVM too. I have two principal groups of applications running on PVM:

	- A library to implement a distributed system environment that present
	  a  high-level  interface  based  in reconfigurable, interconnectable
	  objects.  This  methodology  intend   to   abstract   the  moduling,
	  interfacing,  configuration,  reuse,  and  paralleling  concepts  of
	  software systems in order to simplify user's work. A lot of examples
	  were  building  using  this library: computing  of  PI, solution  of
	  Poisson's equation, etc.

	- A  system  for  artificial  vision   (image  classification)   using
	  artificial neural networks. For  reduce the  training times  and the
	  recognition  times,  the system  was  paralleling  using  the former
	  library.

The computers  used  to  run  these  applications  are  15  workstations  SUN4
(SparcStation 2 with SunOS 4.2) linked with a Ethernet network.

Suggestion:

Is very important  in order that  applications  with  extern configuration can
porting your code to any machine with PVM,  create PVM primitives for join and
leave  a  process  -different  to  the calling process-  to determinate group.
Example:

	  int inum = pvm_jointogroup(int tid, char *group)
	  int inum = pvm_lvfromgroup(int tid, char *group)

where  "tid"  is an integer task identifier and  "group" is a character string
group name of an existing group. The changes in the Group Server code (pvmgs.c)
aren't very complex.

 Dear PVM-team,

Yes, I am using PVM for all my calculations.

The calculations I perform are ab-initio Hartree-Fock calculations
on molecules. I use my own program (called BRABO) in which I
implemented your PVM-system and use it to perform calculations
on large molecules (number of basisfunctions > 1000 (if this has
any meaning to you)).

The program runs on a cluster of 3 RS6K's (375, 365 + 320H) and
separately on a mixed cluster of 3 RS6K's () and 2 DECstations (5000/120).
At the moment the DECstations are being replaced by a SUNspark-20 and
I hope to be using PVM on this node shortly.

Hoping this was of some help,
sincerely,

------------------------------ Start of body part 1

Dear PVM-Team,

I'm studying computer science at the Technical University in Regensburg,
Germany. We uses PVM in one of our classes dealing with parallel computing.

We implemented 2 algorithms (soliaire and gauss-seidel) on a SUN pool with
Sparc Classic and Sparc 5 stations (15 machines alltogether) to get a feel 
for the advantages and problems related with parallel computing/programming. 
So it was a rather short usage of PVM. But I think it's a good tool to use 
resources of workstation pools and give people an insight on parallel 
computing.

I hope I could help you a little.

From: rdb@roke.co.uk (Richard Beton SDH)

At Roke Manor Research Ltd (a company owned by Siemens AG of Germany)
we are using PVM 3.3.5 for several applications:

*) numerical simulations, e.g. radar cross section prediction on
a parallel processor consisting of i860 CPUs with transputer communication
processors, coupled to external Suns and a DEC Alpha. PVM is particularly
used for the workstation interconnection.

*) general workstation connectivity, e.g. data exchange between HP and
Sun workstations for a multi-workstation medical imaging application. One
workstation is dedicated to the MRI scanning image capture, the other to
visualisation, analysis, and surgical therapy planning and assistance.

*) homogeneous workstation connectivity: parallel 'make' of the
software of a larger project. This uses up to 10 Sparcstations for concurrent
compilation of separate software modules for a particular project which 
consist of hundreds of such modules.

The workstations on which we have used PVM are:
	Suns running SunOS4
	Suns running SunOS5
	HP 700 series running HP-UX
	Dec Alpha runnning OSF/1

I have one comment regarding the SunOS5 port: PVM 3.3.3 had a particular
difficulty in starting up pvmd daemons. Once up, the daemons operate
correctly until terminated (always with error). PVM 3.3.5 has improved
on this but it is still not perfect. Although it is now much easier to
start the daemons, they still fail more often than is convenient.

Using the console to add a host, the error message when a failure occurs is
 
libpvm [t40001]: pvm_addhosts(): Pvmd system error 

with 

[t80040000] waitc_get() cod dm_startack from t80000000 wid 262149 not found

Yes.  I am the director of the "Model Advanced Facilities" lab in the
College of Engineering at Univ of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering.
Folks who use the lab rely **heavily** upon PVM.  PVM is used to
develop/test parallel applications on our cluster of FDDI-connected HP and
Alpha workstations.  Several folks then migrate to an IBM SP2 (using PVMe)
for production runs.

Better support for batch-style scheduling and processing.  Ideally, better
integration with the CONDOR distributed-batch/scheduling system would be
ideal. PVM and Condor currently work together, but in a somewhat limited fasion.

A packet "redirection" mechanism which would allow a scheduler to move a
compute node from one CPU to another, etc.

An API interface to PVMD which would be used not by end-user programs, but
by scheduling software.  The API could provide a whole host of functions
that schedulers would love, but would be difficult to accomplish "outside"
of pvmd proper.  i.e. things to gracfully suspend, kill, migrate, etc, a
compute node.
  
Better disaster recovery and cleanup.  By cleanup, I mean if things blowup
then pvmd does not hang, removes lock files, etc, from /tmp, etc.


P.S.:  a heartfelt "Thank You" to the PVM Project Team for all their hard &
excellent work!  Esp in Chemical Engineering polymer studes, here at Univ of
Wisconsin MAF we are making great new strides & discoveries based upon
simulation code written in PVM.

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Well, I've been having a problem with a large application, that passes large
messages, when the number of processors running in parallel is also "large"
(13). I got messages of the kind: "Task xxxxxxx not responding. Marking
task xxxxxx as dead". Noone here seems to know why that happens. My own
suspicion is that PVM has an internal counter in order to detect whether a
task is dead or not, and, because of the large times spent in
communications, some task is unable to update its counter, so PVM doesn't
see it any more.

Should it be true, could you give PVM users some kind of information about
where this counter is located and how it works?

Should it not, do you have any idea of why it's passing?

(Strictly talking, that shouldn't be my problem. I'm just a user and
shouldn't have anything to do with PVM internals. But, if you've got the
answers, they will be welcome).

Second: In Convex, we have got a system of queues, and interactive CPU time
per user is limited. My way of working is as follows: I send the parent
application to the queue. There, it starts PVM, and, once started, spawns
the rest of tasks that will run in parallel.

As I have experienced hundred of times, PVM and children tasks consume
interactive CPU time, in spite of having been started from into the queue
and not having any terminal assigned. Now, let's suppose that you've got
eight tasks running in parallel and that seven of them plus the daemon are
consuming interactive CPU time. How long would you be able to run before
you get the message: "You've reached your i. CPU quote. All your
interactive processes have been killed"? Got the idea?

No need to say that Convex experts assure it's a PVM bug. Do you have
anything to argue? 

If you are wishing to work on any of this and need additional information,
please, email me. I appreciate your interest.

Dear Sirs,

I am briefly responding to your query concerning our use of PVM:

Yes we are using PVM today
(unfortunately version 3.2; where can I get the latest version
including documentation? I have version 3.6 undocumented)

We are using it to run Genetic Algorithms (an embarassingly
parallel application) and we are trying to use it for numerically solving
electromagnetic field propagation problems by applying a parallel
version of the Beam Propagation Method.

We run PVM over a slow ethernet network on Unix workstations, mainly
series HP9000/700. We usually employ two to four workstations, although
we have occasionally used as many as eight.

It would be nice to be able to have PVM be reentrant (if I'm using the term
correctly).  I've run in to problems when I've wanted to monitor host
utilization.  My desire is to send a signal to the host and have it report back
usage stats.  I've found that if the host is blocking while waiting for a
message and gets a signal, it doesn't return from the signal handler
successfully.  I was told by PVM support that because signals are handled
differently on different platforms, a solution to this problem is probably not
feasible.  My only suggestion for a solution would be to have platform specific
versions of PVM.  This problem is probably not significant enough to justify
such a solution, however.

A farm of up to 32 Sparcstations of varying vintage (single SS-I
desktop CPUs through 4x Ross HyperSparc CPUs in SS-10's and 630's).  I
made some effort to run on heterogeneous machines, but it was too
difficult to keep code consistent across platforms that lacked an ANSI
C compiler or had different systems libraries.  Right now I'm working
primarily on a farm of Sparc CPU's that gives me around 250 MFLOPS
sustained on coarsely parallelized von Neummann code running in
master/slave mode, WHILE other folks are using the consoles of many of
those machines for standard Unix activities.  The farm is scalable,
and I hope to get it up to .5-1 GFLOPS over the next year as we
upgrade desktop computing facilities in our department and install
additional compute servers.

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Hmmm, it has been nine months or more since I last worked with it, but
as I recall there are several features that I would like to see
implemented or improved.

1) The processor monitor/control facility is (to say the least)
primitive.  It should return as much information as ps -auxww (BSD)
does on the machine in question for each running process under
control.  It should also allow any (Unix) signal to be sent to those
processes -- I found it necessary to be able to send STOP,CONT, USR1
and USR2 to some of my processes -- INTR and KILL are other natural
candidates for "rogue" processes.  Yes, I could (and did) rsh a ps and
rsh a kill, but this involved a complicated combination of using the
monitor to identify a troubled process, figuring out the machine it
was on, figuring out its (Unix) PID and (Unix) status, and sending it
a (Unix) signal, all the while popping in and out of the monitor or
using multiple windows.  Although not strictly necessary, it would be
wonderful to have a nifty X-client for the monitor program with
buttons and data entry lines and not just a command line version.

2) One of the HARDEST problems to solve in contemporary network
programming is how to write an numerical application with a
non-trivial execution loop (that might run for minutes to hours in a
single loop pass or days or weeks in total) and still allow real-time
program interruption for modification of its run state.  This problem
is especially irritating when one is trying to write a program with an
X-based front end/graphical display.  Current solutions include:
  a) Just use blocking or non-blocking I/O somewhere inside the main
event loop (X or otherwise).  This is fine if the execution loop is
grained to complete in <.1 sec, terrible if it completes in >10 sec
(so one has to wait, and wait, and wait, for the program to get to the
I/O statement).  Note that I disallow entirely the option of polling
in the innermost loops for both efficiency and blocking reasons.
  b) Separate the front end and the main loop into different programs,
called or forked or rsh'd as appropriate.  Set up a the I/O inside the
short event loop of the control program.  Set up sockets and/or pipes
and a signal mechanism to asynchronously interrupt the execution
module, set a flag to interrupt the innermost loops at a suitable
point (a simple conditional is much cheaper than polling for I/O),
handle some I/O in a controlled manner, and resume execution, or
restart the program, or terminate it after writing out its current
state, or whatever.

Note that I have figured out how to do all or most of this with
standard calls and tools -- but doing it is extremely non-trivial
network programming, especially when master (front end) and slave are
on different CPU's.  You could Make The World A Better Place if you
could construct a simple library of function calls that would reduce
all the hard part of this (fork/exec/rsh'ing, building the socket I/O
channels, establishing the signal mechanism that tells the slave to
listen to the master via the channel, and finally making the messaging
channel reliable) to boilerplate.  Quite a bit of this is already in
pvm (one reason I like it) but there's quite a bit missing, especially
on the asynchronous interrupt and signal support side (see item 1, for
example).

As a test case and demonstration, you should build a simple
demonstration of an X front end that serves as a mandelbrot DISPLAY
(only) with buttons and sliders and all, and a pvm-driven set of
clients that run asynchronously and can be interrupted and reset at
any time from the front end.  X-based mandelbrot programs abound, but
the all suffer from the annoying feature that they are not
interruptible in the main X event loop until they finish their current
picture, unless they poll for I/O in the "wrong place".  This can take
a LONG time, or waste a LOT OF time, depending on which you choose to
do.

If you build the support routines needed to do this as a standard part
of pvm and make them really easy to use and functional, you could even
submit the result to the X-Consortium as a contributed library to be
included with the standard release, as it would meet a real need and
fix a real shortcoming of X.  I know many physicists who have
struggled with this particular problem and (usually) worked out their
own solution at the cost of reinventing dozens of network programming
wheels or (occassionally) just thrown up their hands in disgust and
run/interrupted/reset things more simply, more expensively, and less
conveniently by hand.

3) Finally, yes, an interactive parallel (x-based) debugger would
surely help debug the really hard problems that can arise in parallel
code.  When last I used your program, I don't think that it had one,
although a friend did mention that you have started to provide some
sort of facility in this regard.  Keep it up.  Eventually one would
like to be able to single step and debug code running on multiple
processors from a single point of development inside some sort of
sensibly designed GUI.

A good way to stop pvmd's running on other machines would be good.  If
I run on 8 sgi's and one dies, it would be nice if the starting up of
the pvm console could actaully kill off all the other nodes for me.
Instead it seem to not allow you to add the node and you must go kill
it.  I can see where it might not the the default case but it would be
nice if it was an optional startup parameter.

We are currently using pvm in two different Monte Carlo problems.  One is a
radiation heat problem which has random emittance of "photons".  The second
is running random realizations of groundwater flow problems.  

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
 
Short answer is 8 SGIs (Irix5.2 & 4.05) and 3 SUNs (SunOS 4.1.1.2) all of
which are single processor machines.

The long answer:
Although we are a visualization lab (data modeling, geometric modeling, video
production, etc), two of the staffers are engineers whose primary research
focus requires extensive numerical work.  We both thought that pvm might 
be an additional tool for our work.  We have pvm running on 3 SUNs and
8 Silicon Graphics machines.  All of our machines are connected by ether net
although we are considering ATM or FDDI.  We are not doing any shared memory
pvm programming and do not envision future work in that area.  This is because
our primary goals are to solve engineering problems, not to make advances in
high performance computing.  Thus simple calls to start discrete sub-problems
on other machines, as the machines become available, is exactly what we
want out of pvm.  People like us rely upon examples in the pvm documentation
to quickly get things going.  We do not want to take the time to learn the 
verbiage of computer experts, and thus we appreciated the examples in the
documentation and encourage more examples illustrating the capabilities
and tricks of pvm.

I am using PVM today, on a cluster of workstations (DEC stations with ULTRIX,
HP stations with HP-UX, SUNs with SUNOS) and a pentium with Linux.
In total there are more than 80 stations, but most of the time I only
use 10 or 20 of them. 

My applications are cryptanalytic attacks. Some of the most successfull
attacks on for instance the DES use lots of identical operations, easy
to distribute over lots of processors.

The problem I have is that sometimes I lose a machine from the cluster,
and that not all the hosts are aware of this: if I start with 50 hosts,
after a night I typically lose 1 or 2 hosts (that is due to network
problems here), but some of the other 48 hosts think they are still
with 50. The 2 lost hosts sometimes think they are still in the group.

Perhaps that could be improved ?

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Addendum to previous note:

  a) Distribute the software directly through the Web page you
advertised.  Why force potential users to go through netlib?
  b) Your web server seems sluggish.  Move the primary pvm
distribution off onto an SS20 or something, mirror it on the (possibly
overloaded) netlib server, and make it available via
anon-ftp/gopher/WWW as WELL as netlib.  Frankly, netlib is an idea
whose time has completely and irrevocably passed with the overwhelming
acceptance and universality of WWW/Mosaic.  The whole netlib
distribution should now be made available ONLY through the WWW.  Feel
free to pass this idea on to its keepers (they probably know it
already).
  c) Looking through the release notes through 3.3.6, it looks like
several of the features I suggest are still absent.  I suggest that
you really look carefully into the signal/non-blocking I/O problem and
work out a better solution than currently seems implemented, and
better control and debugging features are always welcome...

It works fine by itself, but when I run it on a SUNMP and then
another machine the communication breaks down and I get all kinds

I suspect there are still bugs in the SUNMP port.

Q1: Are you using PVM today?
A1: Yes.

Q2: What are your application(s)?
A2: We are using Monte Carlo simulations to calculate thermodynamic
properties of systems where we need to know the Boltzmann distribution
at higher temperatures to ensure proper sampling of the configuration space.
[See "Reducing quasi-ergodic behaviour in Monte-Carlo simulations by
J-walking: Applications to atomic clusters" by D.D. Franz, D.L. Freeman
and J.D. Doll, J. Chem. Phys. 93, 2769 (1990)]
Instead of calculating such a distribution ahead of time and storing it we run
Monte Carlo simulations at the higher temperatures simultaneously with the
lower-temperature calculations and use PVM to pass the higher-temperature
configurations to the lower temperatures.

Q:How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
A:We are using four Silicon Graphics Indigo workstations.

1 - A graphic interface to allow us to design the processes (agents)
    and the links between them which would generate a C skeleton file to
    run the processes could be very useful and time saving (especially for
    somebody like me who is not a specialist of parallel systems but 
    just an user).

2 - Different examples of applications and configurations could also be
    very usefull.

Dear Sirs,

We are a group of scientists working in Machine Learning.
We are currently using pvm3, in one of our application realized as
a distributed system.

Our application is relative to the concept learning task by using
a genetic algorithm approach. 
We achieve our goal by letting different GA evolve and cooperate
by means of a communication network.

We are currently using pvm3 on these architectures:

SUN4 
  it works very well!

CM5 
  Here, pvm3 is not as robust as on the SUN4 architecture.
  We had problem in the memory allocation for the message passing activity.
  PVM3 was not able to completly de-allocate memory after the receipt of 
  a message. Now we have partially solved the problem, but it still
  exists for communication between the host and the processors network.

Some comments on the PVM book, available on-line-

The PVM book leaves much to be desired:
It's not clear what _kind_ of audience this book is targetted for. 
Is it intended for

1. the scientist/engineer who wants to use PVM to implement some algorithm
   in parallel, or

2. the network programmer, who wishes to understand the implementation
   details?

In case 1, description of the implementation details should be intended
only to show how efficiency gains may be achieved. In case 2, implementation
details should show how the applications motivated PVM design.

In either case, Chapter 7 ("How PVM Works") is confusing, and 
appears to be badly organized; while it makes an attempt to describe 
the data structures used to implement buffers, host tables etc., 
there is a recurring problem of cross-references: terms are used 
before they are clearly defined, so that it neither throws light
on the implementation details, nor does it indicate how to use
the libraries to obtain max. efficiency. This chapter needs some 
serious restructuring.

It's an On-line operation and control of power systems using distributed computing environments.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

I am using 3 different kind of machines using 2 architetures : SUN4 and RS6K
which are described bellow:


DCE#1: Sparc2+Ethernet

	This distributed environment consists of ten SUN UNIX-based workstations (one server 470 and nine
 Sparc2 model) connected as an Ethernet LAN (coaxial cable), featuring nominal bandwidth of 10 Mbps.



DCE#2: RS6K/560+Ethernet

	It's an homogeneous cluster of eight IBM RISC/6000 workstations (model 560) interconnected as an 
Ethernet token-ring LAN (coaxial cable) with nominal bandwidth of 16 Mbps.



DCE#3: RS6K/370+FDDI

	The third DCE used for testing is a cluster of eight IBM RISC/6000 workstations (model 370) that 
constitute a SP1 computer (Scalable PowerParallel System 1). Each node has 256 Mbytes of RAM and delivers
 peak performance of 125 Mflops. The nodes are connected as a fiber optic token-ring LAN (Fiber
 Distributed Data Interface/FDDI), running at nominal bandwidth of 100 Mbps, through an active wire 
center (hub).

	NOTES:

	A) DCE#1 is located in Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Campinas, Brazil;

	B) DCE#2 and DCE#3 were part of the High Performance Computing  National Center at S~ao Paulo 
		State (CENAPAD-SP);

  Linear Algebra.
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
  Five.  The architectures are SUNMP, SUN4SOL2 and LINUX.

In our experience, PVM (up to 3.3.6) is still not very stable on Sun system
with multiple CPUs.  Hope to see some improvement in this area.

>Are you using PVM today?

Yes, for 1.5 years.

>What are your application(s)?

We are developing the software system for a high performance
graphics computer. We use PVM to simulate the multi-processor
and multiple components of the system.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

HP 700s. We typically run everything on 1 machines, though
somtimes we use 2-5 HPs. Eventually we might use up to a dozen
HPs. Our department has a couple of dozen HPs.

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

dear PVM-project team,

thanks for the development of PVM.  the library serves as a valuable
tool for cutting down the idle time of our ws-pools. this way we get 
insight into the parallel programming paradigm at low-cost level.
it demonstrates clearly that the PMV (poor man's view)
of parallel processing is nessecary to let the engineering community
'play around' with new solutionmethods for classical applications....



   Are you using PVM today?
   What are your application(s)?

yes we are using PVM 3.2.6 to study parallel cellular evolutionary
algorithms solving nonlinear functional optimization problems


   How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

we have a couple (30) of workstations HP9000/7[13]? hpux 9.03,
some (6) Sun Sparc and 6 Linux boxes.

- Documentation: Very good, especially the description of the PVM calls

- Installation: You could deliver the software without -g option in the
makefiles. This would be very helpful. A global switch to include -O or -O4
etc.  would save a lot of editing time. (May be you have implemented this
meanwhile)

- The alpha and beta PVM versions of Parsytec PowerXplorer PVM did
not work correct in my applications, so I do not have much
experience here.

- Adding machines to PVM (Add hosts to virtual machine) does not work 
fine with Sun and Solaris 2.3.

 In answer to your polite letter, here are my responses to your questions:


 * Are you using PVM today?

   YES. I am researching with another two persons on the distributed
  execution of programs written in functional languages, and we have
  selected PVM as the ideal software packet to provide the distributed
  execution facilities we need.

  
 * What are your application(s)?

   I started to use PVM working on the distribution of mathematical
  algorithms on a cluster of computers (mainly, matrix products and
  large simulations using different data in each computer, whose
  results where gathered to get global results).

   In our new project, we use the interface facilities of a functional
  language called Caml Light with C. The C functions use PVM to create
  tasks corresponding to modules that act as function servers and to
  perform all the communications needed.

   When a client whishes to perform distributed computations, it enters
  PVM calling a function that registers it in PVM and spawns a number
  of servers specified by the client. Later, when it wants a computation
  to be performed remotely, in a server, it passes all the data needed to
  a C function, which sends them to a job scheduler. The client can
  continue with its own computations, without waiting for the result.
  Later, when the computations performed by the client need the result of
  the remote computation, the client will have to wait for it.
  
   The job scheduler decides which server is to perform the computation
  and sends the data to that server, which will later send the result
  to the client. Servers can also make requests to other servers,
  as we have developed a mechanism to avoid deadlocks.

   If you are interested in knowing more about our project, please do not
  doubt to mail me.


 * How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

   By now we have been using clusters of, at most, 19 Sun SPARCstations ELC.
   For simple trials we use about two or three Sun SPARCstations IPX.
   As you can see they all belong to the SUN4 architecture.

 * Our suggestions.

   We wonder if it would we possible to develop a PVM version capable
  of communicating tasks belonging to different users, as this would
  increase a lot the system flexibility.

   We are also interested in an improvement of the tools to measure
  times and track calls to PVM services. We do think that a lot of
  people is concerned about time measuring, as the reduction in the
  computational times is the real reason for PVM usage.

   Finally we would like to know if there is any forum, congress or
  society dedicated to the study, discussion  and promotion of the
  projects developed using PVM.

  
   Thanks for PVM, we have found it to be a really useful tool.

Thank you very much for PVM! A lot of work and some very nice
projects for our students wouldn't have been possible without
this nice, reliable (and cheap) tool.

  But:

- Tracing is VERY BAD. You should support the paragraph-traceformat.
  XPVM is not stable, useless for interactive or big programs and
  has too limited functionality in tracing compared to paragraph. Pablo is
  not easy available on HPPA's and thus no alternative.

- I have to use the hostfile very often to set paths, ... .
  Certainly this info is stored in an internal datastructure. It
  would be a very nice (and maybe simple to realize) feature to 
  get info about the actual options of specific hosts from within
  the pvm console.

- XPVM is based on Tcl/Tk, tools not very stable and not portable
  over their own versions. A simple X or Motif GUI would be
  preferable (Motif is not free, ... -I know).

Hi!

>Are you using PVM today?

Yes.

>What are your application(s)?

I'm working on a compiler for a new Pascal-like programming language, APRIL, that
is intended for the easy parallelization of divide and conquer algorithms. The
compiler generates C code which uses PVM for message passing. Example applications
for my compiler (and therefore for PVM, too) include a chip layout algorithm,
a Mandelbrot program, and an algorithm for the travelling salesman problem.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

I've used SUN workstations (Sparc 1, Sparc 2, Sparc 10: architecture SUN4) and
HP 9000/720 workstations (architecture: HPPA). I've used up to 16 SUN's and
up to 70 HP's without problems. We have 110 HP's but I've had serious problems
when I had more than about 70 HP's in the virtual machine. Machines started to drop
out of the virtual machine before I even started an application. I've had
error messages like:

[t80040000] netinput() FIN|ACK from hphalle2j
[t80040000]  hd_dump() ref 1 t840000 n "hphalle2j" ar "HPPA" lo ""

[t80040000]            tx 9 rx 6 rtt 0.310330

>Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

In general I've been very satisfied with PVM, except for a few problems. First, I've
had the problem I mentioned above with more than about 70 machines. I guess that
it might be caused by some buffers or other data structures within PVM being
configured too small at our site (I'm not the person who installed PVM here).

Another problem I encountered was that messages got lost when I used the option
PvmRouteDirect and a process terminated (pvm_exit) immediately after sending
a message. I got around it by having the master program send a termination
message (via PvmDontRoute) to all other processes. The other processes wait
for this message before they terminate.

By the way, we're still using PVM 3.2.6 at our site.

>Your help is much appreciated.

I hope I was of assistance.

Keep up the good work!

Dear collegue,
	I used PVM until December in a work to finish my undergraduate 
course. The Abstract of my work was:

	Parallel computing has been used to btain a better performance in 
computer systems, as well as a good cost-benefit relation. Nowadays, with 
the sequential computing technology achieving its limit, it becomes more 
important to explore the parallel processing.
	Parallel computing can be explored with the use of software 
environments developed specifically to this goal. Among these 
environments, Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) can be emphasized. PVM is a 
software system that permits a network of heterogeneous UNIX computers to 
be usde as a single large parallel computer.
	This work intends to use the distributed parallel processing with 
the PVM in a network of IBM RISC/System 6000 workstations. In the study 
of this environment a granularity analysis and a comparison between the 
sequential and parallel processing are included.
	During this work, PVM was intalled at UCPEL (my University), 
organized with samples programas and with a user's manual to help 
researchers who want to use this parallel computing environment.

PVM team,

I did not have a need to use pvm for last year so my feed back might not
be up to date. But a year ago a succesfully run pvm on 9 silicon graphics
machines and 10 next machines. Unfortunatelly I could  run it on both 
kinds of machines at the same time becouse they all share the same disk
space and make program was creating different copies of executable file in
both kinds of machines that overwrite each other. But this is the problem
with our local setup not pvm itself.

We investigated the feasibility of using non-dedicated parallel systems
with PVM and concluded that the convenience depends essentially on the size
of the computational domain as compared to the relative processor power and
network bandwidth. We point out the software still offers great opportunities
of improvement, especially in terms of latency times in the message-passing
protocols. In condition of significant gain in terms of speed-up, such
workstation arrays represent a cost-effective approach to massive parallel
computation (see Reale, Bocchino and Sciortino, Comp. Phy. Comm. 83 (1994),

I can get pvm to speed up fairly well with a malloc replacement library
my company sells (the Memory Tuning System, or MTS).  First, would the
University be interested in shipping a faster PVM with a portable, much
faster malloc package?  Or, somehow allow us to have a reference out on
netlib or something?  Second, how would one go about getting a copy of
the pvm mailing list in order to see if there are any pvm users that
would be interested?

XPVM is very nice; keep up the good work there!

PVM itself seems to be improving in quality and acceptance over time; my
fear is that it is quickly approaching the point where it has a
sufficiently large user group that we may have to start (gasp :-) paying
for it.

From: Tan Tai Ann <fyp20ts@sentosa.sas.ntu.ac.sg>

i'm working on my university final year project in pvm.

my project is dealing with the load balancing in pvm environment.

currently my lab has a heterogenous plateform, consisting of SUN SPARC, R6000 and some DEC machines. however, i merely work on SUN and if time permits i will
consider to implement my applications in DEC as well.



[PS] i have one doubt about pvm and wander if u could answer me :
	does pvm itself currently support load balancing cos' i found one
	article written by Vaidy Sunderum which mention about pvm load
	balancing capability. according to him  pvm could schedule its tasks
	to machines with lighter load or cpu queue. is this ture?

(1)  Yes, I am using PVM today.

(2)  I've used PVM over a network Suns, but for more serious work I use
a devoted cluster of IBM RS6000s.

(3)  My applications have been parallel nonlinear programming approaches
to parameter estimation problems in the geosciences.

A bit more efficiency in the message buffering and copying overhead would
be nice.  Otherwise, PVM is a very good system.  From my vantage at the
NSF Center for Research for Parallel Computing, it's been interesting to 
see how PVM has affected practical parallel computing.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Well, a couple of things........
But, firstly I am not sure if these suggestions have already
been implemented...........so forgive my ignorance....

1. From the slave processor, instead of writing output to
   a temporary file when using 'write(*,*)', at times it would
   be useful to have these written straight to the screen.
   One might have each slave id number before something is written...

2. To be able to choose which machine a slave may use...
   Because, I am not sure how PVM chooses its slaves. Sometimes
   I often wonder why one particular machine is chosen even though
   it has a higher load than another? Could you please reply to this
   question.

3. I would like to know(perhaps visually??) which slaves are waiting
   for data and which are chewing away at the data...
   I know this is possible by plenty of write statements, that is why
   I have suggested visual implementation...


I can't really think of much else right now, but if I can, I will
pass these on to you.......

All the work you do is greatly appreciated here at Uni of Queensland...

Hi there!

	Yes I'm using a lot PVM : I am  PhD student
	working on solving the Navier Stokes Equations with some high 
	precision schemes. My target machine is the T3D and the SP2, but
	I debug and program on a RS6000 Station with PVM : it keeps me
	from spending too much time (and money) on the real machines, and
	offers me a nice platform to debug my code.

	Although I use PVM, I wanted to access the shmem memory library of
	the T3D. So, instead of calling PVM directly in my code, I call my
	own subset of (very limited) instructions of communications, which
	call either PVM primitive, either T3D routines on the real machine.
	That way, I think my code stays quite portable and can sustain better
	performance on the T3D.



    pvm-survey> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are
    pvm-survey> welcome.  

	Thank you very much for the great job you do on PVM! 
	
	Would it be possible to have some global function as  a
	global add or global min? 
	Also it would be a blast if we could have a better parallel 
	debugging tool for SPMD programs. I dream of a hack, under
	unix or emacs, to be able to put a breakpoint at a line in
	every similar program of one session PVM... In a word, a
	way of avoiding to have to jump from windows to windows to
	type in the same order in as many dbx windows as there are
	similar tasks running.

Dear PVM Project Team, 

I'll try to answer your questions. 

*  Are you using PVM today?

   Yes

*  What are your application(s)?

   Mainly for education: programming shared memory and 
   distributed memory parallel computers. 


*  How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

   PVM is running on a KSR1 with 32 Processors and on Unix-Worksations. 
   We use PVM in combination with the Pthread library on the KSR1 
   and for communication between KSR1 and Workstations. 


Yours Heinz Kredel


By the way: How did you know we are using PVM ?
----------------------------------------------------------------
From: Michel DAYDE <dayde@enseeiht.fr>

Are you using PVM today?
  The answer is definitively yes...

What are your application(s)?
  We use it both in training and research.

1. Training :
     We use as an example of message-passing programming environment.
We have lectures on introduction to PVM (in our university, but
we do the same lectures in courses that are funded by EEC). We use
it also for demonstrating some of the particular aspects of heterogeneous
computing. The main aspect in the PVM course are hands-on sessions.

2. Research :
   PVm is used for developing parallel codes on distributed memory computers
and clusters of workstations. These parallel codes are sparse codes
(direct and iterative solvers) and computational kernels in linear algebra,
and solution of large scale optimization problems. Note that this involves
collaborations with various labs, espceially CERFACS and RAL.

   WE are also heavily involved in parallelizing industrial codes. For example,
we have parallelized a flutter calculation code for Aerospatiale on
workstation clusters using PVM.
    We also use PVM (and PARMACS) within an ESPRIT project, called
Parallel Aero, funded by EEC. This project concerns the parallelization
of a 3D Navier-Stokes Solver and involve several partners (CERFACS, CIRA,
ENSEEIHT-IRIT, EPFL, RUS, KTH, and industrial partners that use the
code Aerospatiale and SAAB).

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
    WE run PVM on a large range of workstations : DEC, IBM, HP, SUN
connected by Ethernet, FDDI, or SOCC (only some of these are in-house).
WE use it (or will soon use it) on BBN GP1000 and BBN TC2000, 
CRAY T3D, KSR1, and CONVEX Exemplar.


Sincerely yours,
      Michel Dayde,
      ENSEEIHT-IRIT

Dear PVM authors !

I've started using PVM in october.I tried it because I was very interested 
how to use heterogenous network as single parallel machine.I'm fan of UNIX 
(especially Linux) and everything connected with this system.I'm computer 
science student at Warsaw University of Technology.In your letter one could 
find me twice, so I will give to responses.
My experiences:
as tlukas@ibspan.waw.pl
I use it to write simple applications to run on cluster of SUN workstations.
I've tried to implement some well-known algorithms dedicated to parallel 
machines like parallel merging, some tree-searching etc.
as tomaszl@if.pw.edu.pl
We've got only one SUN workstation and PC running Linux.I tried this 
combination and it works!
I use PVM also on my PC at home ( it's a cluster containing only one host )

I'm primer PVM user so I don't have any special suggestions.

Thanks for PVM

:Are you using PVM today?

Yes, I am. In general, I use it about three times a week.

:What are your application(s)?

self written ones (mostly Master-Slave applications) and several so called 
Basic Linear Algebra Routines (e.g. ScaLapack, currently I try to install it)

:How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

homogenous RS/6000 cluster of 16 machines (including 9 workstations)

:Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

In my eyes, PVM is in a state that is nearly more user-friendly and
reliable (in terms of bugs or stability) than most other commercial
software. One very important aspect is the documentation. At our department,
the name "Jack Dongarra" stands for high quality meanwhile.
The documentation isn't only useful as a reference. It's easy to understand
and quite a new PVM user will be well prepared after reading it.
So far the good things...

There are some additional remarks for my private use of PVM.
I am connected via an Ethernet with some other PC's running Linux. We got
installed PVM 3.3 successfully. But there was little trouble compared to the
installation at our RS/6000 cluster.
Furthermore, there are some small problems using PVM at home. We all have
exported /usr/local/bin/pvm3 or mounted it with NFS at the same location.
Unfortunately we need to add the dx (?) statement to add another machine to
our configuration. That's somehow annoying because we all use the same
domain name and the same location. And what's more, we cannot start pvmgs
anyway.

Summarizing it, it may be useful to spend some time on the Linux users of PVM.


:Best wishes,

same to you !

Best regards, 
Thomas.

Dear PVM developers,

Thank you very much for your excellent program. I hav used it to
obtain all my results of the thesis. I have also encourage people to
us it too. So I am very pleased to participate in your survey

I do calulate complex vertex functions for electrial and magnetical
properties in higly correlated electron systems. I have to do a lot of
threefold integrations to obtain a two dimensional complex
Vertexfunktion $\Delta(x,y)$. Im princible each point (x_i,y_j) can be
calulated via one PVM task.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
I use 3-9 IBM RS/6000 plus three DEC ULTRIX workstations. I plan to
run my monitor jobs localy on my Linux PC.

I still using PVM 3.2 at the moment since I had problems to upgrade to
version 3.3. everything compliles fine, the tasks could be spawn, but
the messages sent by the tasks disapper. After my PhD exam in February
I will try your latest version of PVM and try to locate the problem.

Dear Sir,

Information about my applications:

1. I am using PVM3.3 today. I have used PVM for one year.

2. My main research interest lies in parallel algorithms 
   for solving linear equations on workstation cluster. 
   The results are expected to be used in the simulation 
   of large electrical networks.

3. I use three DECstation 5000 workstations connected 
   through Ethernet.


Comments and suggestions:

My experience shows that PVM is relatively portable and 
compatible; it is easy to learn and use. It is a good 
parallel programming platform for workstation clusters. 
However, the user wants to have a much clear PVM user's 
guide, especially, clear and sufficient information about 
the commands (Appendix A. Reference pages for PVM3.3 
routines).

Best wishes,

Mubin

Hi!

 > Are you using PVM today?
We are using PVM in some parts of our graduation thesis. The biggest
part was to analyse if it was possible to use a number of workstations,
running PVM over a ordinary network, as a large parallel machine in the 
parallel computation courses.

I have to admit that our resuls are a bit depressing. In short, we need
a lot faster network to be able to using the workstations as a parallel 
machine.

We will also use PVM later when converting a CONLAB-compiler from using
PICL to PVM. CONLAB is an environmemt to devolp parallel algorithms in
a MATLAB like notation.
 > 
 > What are your application(s)?
We have just run some small communication and calculation intensive
testprograms.
 > 
 > How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
So far we have run PVM on up to 16 IBM RS6000 (PowerPC) connected in an
ethernet network. If the time admit we will run on Sun:s and SGI indy:s, too.
If we use all machines with approximately equal computation-power we will be 
using 30-40 computers.
 > 
 > Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

The only thing I can think of at the moment is some kind of 
'history'- function, ala csh or tcsh, in the pvm-console.

Re:  Your survey.

Please note that you mailed me at my old email address which
was al@andltd.and.nl.  Now that we have our own email feed you
should use the correct address:  al@amsoft.demon.co.uk

We are not using PVM on a regular basis.  It has been (and will 
be) used mainly for research and investigation purposes.  It is
something that we would spend more time on if time was available.

Application for PVM is investigation of a parallel branch and
bound algorithm.  This is used for solving large mixed integer
programming problems.

The only machines that we have used are 2 Sun Sparc computers 
running  SunOS 4.1

Generally we were quite impressed with the ease of use but it
did take some time to get access to the manual - we don't have 
a postscript printer.  Is it also available as ASCII.

I am using PVM and I intend to use it a lot more in the future.

My applications are oriented towards computational dynamics. I have 
adapted the spmd example, to build a tree architecture which allows
the simulations for multibody systems of flexible contacting bodies.
The numerical algorithm is, in principle, an asynchronous relaxation
method for differential systems of equations.

The machines are SUN workstations (SPARC IPC, SPARC LX, SPARC 5) running
the SUN operating system. The number of machines I have used until now is
ten, but I intend to expand it in the future.

The reason I "left" PVM is that I was running a Master/Slave program
on a CM-5 where most communication was between the master and the
slave.  Using CMSSL the communication goes like this:

	[Master (Front end)]	<--->  [Slave (Node)]

With PVM:

	[Master (F.E.)] <---> [pvmd (F.E.)] <---> 
		[PVM Host program (F.E.)] <---> [Slave (Node)]

And, even worse: The Master could send data so fast that pvmd couldn't
pass it on fast enough, so it grew and grew until memory became very
short.

But I must say that I am glad that I made the program in PVM first.
Debugging on our local workstations probably more than halved the
developing time, and then it was very easy to port the working
application to CMSSL.  If I am ever again going to write a message
passing program on a MMP, I'll seriously consider writing and
debugging it in PVM, and then port it if necessary.

Thanks for making PVM available.

Dear Colleagues,

We apologize for our late in answering. Here you can find our answer
(and some question).

> Are you using PVM today?
Here at our departement we are starting now to using PVM.

> What are your application(s)?
I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering and my Interests are
Application of Parallel and Distributed systems to Computer
Vision problems.
I work together with Paolo Marenzoni,
another PhD student, whose interests are
Massive Parallel Systems performance study and analisys and
Petri Nets, and with some undergraduate students,
Stefano Brozzi, Andrea Menozzi and Cristina Molinari.
Our interests are fundamentally two:
1. Using the PVM to obtain a MIMD distributed solution for
   very big Petri Nets.
2. The use of PVM to integrate some distributed Image Processing
   tools, expecially AVS.
    We read on the Web page of Computer Graphics Unit of
    Manchester Computing Centre, University of Manchester,
    United Kingdom the summaries of the results of the Summer
    Projects made at Computer Graphics Unit in 1993 and 1994 and we
    think that the following two projects are particularly interesting:

      1) Andrew Banks (1993) " A 30-page tutorial on parallel AVS "

      2) David Bancroft (1994) " Parallel AVS on HP/Silicon Graphics using PVM "

    We would like to know if more information about these projects, or
    about others concerning these arguments, are available via ftp or Web
    (we were unable to find them on Web pages) or if at least you can mail
    us the involved people's E-mail (if they have one) so that we can contact
    them directly.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
We have installed PVM v. 3.3.6
on a series of SPARC stations with various processors
and memory configurations, and we have encountered some problems.
To save disk space we have installed PVM in the directory /usr/local/pvm3,
setting correctly the PVM_ROOT and PVM_ARCH environment variables.
1. The compilation under SOLARIS 2.0 stops, with some library not found
   complain.
2. Under SunOS 4.1.2 all seem to work, but not always.
3. Under SunOS 4.1.3 we have some problems at run time, i.e. the spawn
   does not always work, with no apparent cause.
4. When we tried to install (unpacking the tar file) the HeNCE program
   some strange link errors (i.e. ldopen not found...) appeared in the
   successive compilations.

Could you help us to solve these problems?

Thanks in advance.

More performance information would be useful (e.g., what latencies and
bandwidths to expect from SUNMP implementation).  Provision of cpu-time and
wall-time timer functions within the PVM library would be *extremely* useful,
though very difficult I realize (would require PVM authors to implement C and
Fortran bindings to highest-resolution clock functions for every supported
hardware type).

I am currently developing a program to solve spin waves.  Simulating a
piece of magnetic tape as a pseudo 2-D surface of vectors(rods)
pointing in the direction of the rods spin axis.  There is heavy
communication between neighbor rods and the size of the blocks to
break the computation into needs to be optimized.  Space parallization
is all I have implemented so far, but I hope to get far enough to also
implement time parallization methods with multigrid.  But development
is going slow.

     > How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

I have used it on a network of 16 SUN4 machines, and a stand alone
LINUX platform.  But I'm having trouble spawning slaves in LINUX, so
my experience is limited.
	
     > Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

I'm new to C and to parallel computing.  I am also a undergrad looking
for "summer opportunities".  If there is some way for you to
put me in touch with people offering internships, workshops, and such,
by all means pass this along.  Also, I would like to find more people at my

Dear Colleagues,

Here are some answers to your pvm-survey-questions.


Are you using PVM today?

   Yes.

What are your application(s)?

   We developed parallel solver for 3D electrostatic field calculations
   This solver is used also by designers of high voltage insulation in ABB 
   The parallel computation with PVM allow to use the existing hardware
   and to achieve the speed up of the design process. The software is used 
   by R&D departments in production sites as well as in ABB Corporate
   Research Centers. 

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

   We are using workstation clusters including Sun, IBM RS6k, and HP 700.
   Our application is not very dependent from the communication speed
   so we can use standard ethernet for communication (provided that it
   is not overloaded) We are currently  using not more than 10 workstations
   in a cluster. An important problem for us is good reliability of 
   calculations in heterogeneous clusters - the calculation must go on 
   even if one of workstations fails.
   We are going now to implement our solver for IBM SP2.

From: Parallel VM <pvm@risc.uni-linz.ac.at>

Dear Colleagues,

I am glad to answer to your questions.

Yes - I am currently using PVM (though, to say the truth, I am considering the
possibility to reconfigure the applications towards the MPI standard).

The use of PVM concerns a parallel distributed kernel for a C++ math library;
such a kernel provides basic primitives for local and remote activation of
parallel tasks. The thread-based nature of the library is somehow conflicting
with the non-reentrancy of the PVM code; this is one of the main reasons for
considering a passage to MPI.

At the moment, PVM is used in a test version of the library, running on a
Sequent Symmetry machine. Very soon we plan to export the library to a set
of Silicon Graphics workstations. The final step will be exporting it to an
SP-2 environment - but this will take some time.

Hope it is useful. Best wishes,

From: Clayton Heller <cheller@uni-sw.gwdg.de>

To whom it may concern,

In regards to your request for information on PVM usage:

I have developed an interactive orbit analysis code which uses 
version 3 of PVM.  It finds, as a function of energy, all of the 
characteristic periodic orbits in a rotating non-axisymmetric 
potential and determines their
stability.  It will also produce, for a given energy,  a phase space
map showing the regions of stability and chaos.  This information is
used to understand gas flows in barred galaxies.  The algorithm
uses a fairly sophisticated load balancing scheme which allows for
efficient operation in a heterogeneous environment with processors
of widely varying speed and load.  It is also robust in the sense that
the loss of processors during the run will not affect the computation.

I have been running at the University of Kentucky (for about three years)
on a collection of
Sun, HP, and Decstation workstations.  Unfortunately, since my arrival
in Gottingen Germany I have not been able to get PVM to work on a
network of Dec Alphas.  Version 3.2.6 would not compile on one machine,
compiled on another but would not spawn the pvm deamons.  I installed
3.2.5 and got it to compile and start up, but it would not start 
my slave processes (just froze).  As I have been busy on other things
lately, I have not tried anything else or contacted anyone.  I will try
again later this month and if I still have trouble will e-mail your
group for help.

Yes, I am using PVM with my student for speeding up multiple 
simulation of electronic circuits. The need arises eg. when we perform 
statistical performance evaluation of a circuit, or do optimization. 
In our applications certain number of circuit analyses are needed 
before a decision is made (by an algorithm or by a human). Parameters 
for these analysis can differ slightly (eg. in sensitivity analysis) 
or substancially (eg. in Monte Carlo). We try to deal with both 
situations, although so far the second is investigated more. We 
have plans for using PVM for speeding up simulations related to 
noise phenomena in circuits.
We use PVM on different SparcStation machines of Sun (with single 
CPU) under Solaris2. PVM serves us as an interface standard for 
distributed programming and as a quality library that implements that 
standard. So far we have not experimented with fine-grain 
parallelization, because of our hardware, but it is good to 
know it is there when we have resources and a need.

I do not currently use PVM, although I may resume using it
in the future.

It was used in a particle-in-cell model for simulations of 
mesoscale features, such as eddies and coastal fronts in 
oceanography.

PVM was mostly used on a network of Sun workstations, although
some experimentation was done with PVM on a Cray T3D.

At this time, our problem does not require PVM.  We found that
each workstation finished its task quickly, while packing, sending,
and receiving messages consumed more time.  Network traffic was
a major culprit of this.

The fact that pvm is not Fortran 90 standard-complying was
initially irksome and had to be overcome with writing modules
for making the interface to some routines "generic."

Dear Sirs,

I am currently using pvm3 on a CM5, here I have the following problem.

I  have communications between a process on the host and the other
processes on the partitions. Every time a new communication of this
kind happens, there is a new allocation of memory on the hosts.
BUT NO FREE of the previous one!!!
So in the long runs, the whole process run out of memory!!


Do you have any suggestion for helping me with this problem?

Thanks.

I am using PVM for almost a year.

I have used it for exercises in Parallel Programming course,
exercises in Distributed Computing course and currently
I am using it in the implementation of a technique for
trace-collection of programs written in Fortran+PVM which
is actually my master thesis topic.

Machines that I've used PVM on are:
2 DEC-Stations
up to 15 DEC-ALPHAs
up to 10 SUN-3 and SUN-4 machines.

I recently received a query from you about our PVM usage.  I've
been out sick, so hopefully this is not too late!


Are you using PVM today?
	
	Yes.

What are your application(s)?

	1. Distributed version of the POVRAY raytracer.  We generate
	   a large number of raytraced scenes for scientific visualization
	   and occasionally use a PVM-ized version of the code which was
	   done by Brad Kline at Cray (patches available at ftp.povray.org)

	2. A C language extension called "Glenda" was built on top of
	   PVM.  For "normal" users, this greatly eases the overhead
	   involved in learning PVM.  Using Glenda (and therefore
	   indirectly using PVM), I wrote some codes to examine the
	   efficiency of using the local Sun network to do some tasks
	   like optimal interpolation.  These are mostly toy codes so
	   far though.

	3. In the works:  one of our contractors is writing a PVM-ized
	   version of an ocean circulation model.  The goal is to have
	   a code which will run on the T3D, SP2, and local Sun network
	   as needed.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

	Successful:  a network of Suns of various types (mostly
		Sparc2, 10, and 20's)

	Unsuccessful:  between a Sparc10 and a Cray YMP.  

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

	Some method of load balancing would be useful.  I
	try to use agenda methods to divide up problems so that
	slow machines end up doing fewer parts, but this is not
	always possible.  Ideally (and this would be asking a lot!)
	some sort of process migration where jobs would "shift"
	to idle machines would be available.

Our main concern with PVM is that current tests on a ATM network showed we
could only get a factor of 2 improve in performance from our 10BaseT
network.
Since the ATM network is more than 2 times faster, we need to resolve if
the system software or PVM is the bottleneck.
Any suggestions would be helpful.

Dear PVM-Team People,

  First of all, Thanks for addressing us. It's our pleasure to take part 

 in this survey and contribute to your project (some results from our 

 experience with it), as it appears to be a quiet usefull one.

  Here are the answers to your 3 questions:

 1.  Yes, we are using PVM for the last few months. we're evaluating the usage

   in terms of Total Time Consumption when making our computations, and so far 

   the results are quiet promising, showing improvements that fit our needs.

 2.  The main application we use with PVM was developed in our company (Israel

   Electric Corporation  - Research & Development department).

     This application is using changing sets of restrains and field-conditions

   to plan an "annual time-schedule for all maintenance operations" in power-stations

   and power-units all over the country.

 3.  We are using different numbers of machines each time, depending upon the "load"

   on machines and through our network. We've checked this system upto 16 machines

   simoultaneuously (it looks o.k.) but for getting good results, we've experienced

   that 6 to 9 machines are better and sometimes even less (this is influenced also

   by our network conditions).

     The important issue, from our point of view, is that we are using mixed 

   combinations of: 
			Decstations 5000/240 (running Ultrix 4.3)
			&
			Digital Alpha work-stations (running OSF 1.3 or 1.2).

From: Henrik Lauf Christensen <lauf@iesd.auc.dk>

During the last semester I have participated in a group where we have made an
evaluation of PVM.

In doing this we have made two application and some synthetic benchmarks. The
two application benchmarks were:

	1: Raytracing. This was done by putting a PVM-shell around POV-ray.
	  The achieved speedup was 19.

	2: Game of Life. The achieved speedup was 26 with a large board
	  consisting of 2000x2000 squares. With smaller boards the speedup
	  was below 1, mainly due to poor performance of Ethernet.

The conclusion for the application benchmarks were, that PVM is only suited for
coarse-grained applications, because communication over network is *very* slow.
We had no particulary load balancing, and belive a more efficient load balan

...continuing broken mail.

cing would have increased the achieved speedup somewhat.

The synthetic benchmarks were designed to measure the performance of PVM's
message-passing via Ethernet and found that PVM introduced some overhead in
the magnitude of 2 to 5 times.

We have around 120 SUN workstations available at the campus running SUN4 and
SUN4SOL2. We experineced some problems when trying to connect more than 50
workstations. We either could not add more machines or we lost connection to
them. Wheter this was due to the many experiments on the workstations and the
network or PVM, we do not know.

(speedup in the two application benchmarks was achieved with 50 workstations).

I am not using PVM at present, but probably will start using it
within a few weeks. It will then be used with an IBM SP2
(RS 6000 processors, AIX operating system).

I have tried PVM, a year and a half ago, just running a couple
of RS6000/550:ies as one virtual machine, communicating on
an Ethernet, but this was just to see how it worked. It did.

From: teompf@garm.teokem.lu.se (Markus Fulscher)

   Dear Colleague,

   I am a member of the department of Theoretical Chemistry at the 
   University of Lund (Sweden). Recently, we started a project aiming
   at the parallelization of our programs - the software package is 
   called MOLCAS and is available for various machines. The goal is
   to rewrite the programs in such a way that they can be run on 
   distributed as well as shared memory machines. The specific 
   architectures we have in mind are heterogeneous networks such as
   clusters of work stations, the IBM/SP2 and SGI's parallel work stations.
   As PVM is de facto a standard running almost any UNIX based computers 
   it is the natural choice to solve the communication problem. Moreover, 
   as IBM, SGI and other vendors offer machine specific implementations 
   of PVM tuned for maximum efficiency portability is granted. 

   An other standard that may be used to reach our goal is MPI.
   At present we think, however, MPI is to complex to be used in
   a straight forward way. Moreover, to my knowledge not to many 
   vendors offer products based on the MPI standard.
   
   As PVM is a rather simple tool it misses several features of 
   importance with respect to the development of new codes such as
   powerful monitors to watch the performance of the program. Because
   of that we are using IBM's PE which is based on the MPI standard
   as a development toolkit (a transparent interface is under 
   development).

Dear Colleague,

As You asked in Your e-mail of 6-1-1995, I send You the answers on the
questions related to what we are 
doing with PVM.

1. We intend to use PVM this days. It is not Yet installed. I started
studying the reference guide, in order to make me familiar  with the
concept.

2. I'm working in the nuclear world, doing Monte-Carlo simulations with the
code MCNP developed by
ORNL and LANL. An option of this code is that it is modified in a way
permitting to run the code under PVM. In my present day work I need to
tackle two types of problems. In order to perform optimisation studies, I
need calculation power of the scale of huge main frame in order to perform
the runs in a suitable period of time. The solution is a large number of
machines in a distributed systems management system ( with AMD tech for
distribution of file systems ) and a script starting the code once a
previous run is finished. A second type of problems is the one where I need
to run once the code but with an enormous number of particles. Here PVM is
very helpful.

3. For the moment I have only 13 Sparc 10 and 20 machines available under
Solaris 1.1.1. In our institute I have access to a Dec - Alfa and probably
also to a HP 9000/735. As a first test I want to use only the Sun stations.

Hi 

I received your survey e-mail concerning usage of PVM at our site.
Sorry it's taken me so long to respond to your e-mail, but I was 
actually attending a conference (the 33rd AIAA meeeting in Reno NV)
presenting a paper on our work using PVM at deHavilland Inc. in
Toronto.

Anyway here are my answers to your questions:

1: Are you using PVM today?

   Yes

2: What are your application(s)?

   I've used PVM with the 3D multi-block structured grid generation
   code GRIDGEN3D. I'll shortly be using PVM to parallalize a flow
   solver (initially Euler, then Navier Stokes). In addition, there
   are at least two more guys at deHavilland who are investigating
   the use of PVM with their codes. I don't know too much about their
   work, so I can't give you any more details about their work.

3: How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

   I've used the PVM version of GRIDGEN3D on various sized Virtual
   Machines. The largest was 86 machines and comprised of about 70
   IBM RS6000 workstations (both 41T and 355 models) and about 16
   SGI machines (R4000, 4D/35 and Indigo machines).

Hope that answers your questions. If you need more info, don't 
hesitate to contact me again.


Best Wishes

-->Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

We had some difficulties to use the Multithreaded library on PVM.
Because we wanted a Preemptive execution with priorities, we had some
difficulties because the PVM kernel is not MT-SAFE (Multithreading safe).
We modified the PVM library and protected the critical, global and
shared data (for example the message buffers...).

The students appreciated PVM, because the model is very simple to understand
and they "easily" build real parallel program. But student often make mistakes
and the debugging is difficult.

Best regards and happy new year to the PVM team!

The order of receiving data is not correct.
In the case one task is direct linked with for example taskA
and another task isn't, I detected the following problem:
If the direct linked task sends first
and taskA receives (with wildcards)  after the send of the two tasks,
taskA gets the message of the direct linked task second.
(the sending tasks must be on different machines than the receiving
 task).

I was not able to use two different Sun workstation networks
here on campus.  Each network had its own file structure with
PVM installed in a different named directory.  I was never
able to attach processors from the other network to a job
running on one of the networks.  I tried using the directory
information according to the suggestion of someone who responded
to my e-mail message but this never worked.  I finally gave up.
This was about a year ago.  I would really like to be able to
utilize this feature.

am hoping to modify a large Natural Gas Pipeline simulator to  
incorporate PVM and take better advantage of our computing  
resources.

It was used not so much for an application but rather a teaching  
aid for instruction in the capabilities of a network of computers  
and the potential of the network in our organization.

PVM has been run on a small network of six Sun SPARCstations and  
two Intel machines running SCO UNIX.

Again, thank you for the terrific software and keep up the great work!

Regards,

Rob Caljouw

Problems: on the sun network, we use an installation of PVM 3.3.5
and it works fine locally, but we didn't manage to establish a 
connection to the pvm on the AP1000 at imperial college, London.
This is probably due to version incompatibilities (version 3.2.?
being installed there).
Other comments: nice system !!

Dear PVM Project Team,

   Although aware of PVM's existence for some time, I had not used it in
anger until last November, when I employed it as the basis for a short course
on parallel programming. I was most impressed! Its major strengths, as I see
it are:

1. it is available on a great variety of machines and architectures, making 
   it the most portable message passing system that I know;

2. it is easy to set up; I obtained it by email and installed it on a network 
   of Silicon Graphics workstations from scratch, with the minimum of fuss; a
   PC running LINUX was later added with no problems;

3. PVM is extremely well documented; I borrowed freely from the user's guide
   for the course;

4. the examples provided are a good basis for practical workshops, but could
   have to be tidied a little.

   I have one major criticism. The mechanism for sending and receiving seems
at first, at least, extremely clumsy. Is there a good reason that send and
receive procedures cannot be pointed at user created buffers rather than the
implicit current send and receive buffers?

   I hope my comments have been of some assistance.


Yours sincerely,

Keith Taylor

Dear PVM Project Team,

I use pvm in release 3.3 on a hp cluster of 6 machines and a linux pc.

It is used to run parts of a Finite Element programm parallel.

It tok a long time (half a year) to make this programm running parallel. But 
reason is not given by pvm. 

In future I will try to use also the CRAY T3D SC 192 in Berlin. Internet name
cray@zib-berlin.de . There is Cray MPP PVM-3 availiable.

2) Our application is a molecular dynamics code for macromolecules (X-PLOR).

3) We have tried to impliment our pvm based code on 8 different
   platforms, mainly workstations (next, hp-735, dec-alpha, sgi-r4000,
   ibm-rs6000, and sgi-onyx), and custom mpp hardware (cray-t3d and

Dear Colleague:
	I have received your email about pvm survey.Thank for your email.I have a 
pleasure to answer your three questions , and I want to send an improved aimk
file to you.I hope that you will send me some new information about PVM in the 
future.

First, I answer your questions:
1) Are you using PVM today?
  Yes,I am using PVM3.3.5. 

2) What are your application(s)?
  Our applications are scientifical computing and its visualization.

3) How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
  Our project is called "Scalable Parallel Clusters System".We have used six 
SPARCstion 2 and 10 with PVM. We will use eight heterogeneous machines which
consists of SPARCstation2 ,SPARCstation 10,SGI and Intel Pentium PC with PVM.

Second,I used aimk to compile PVM programs,when I gave make file a name 
"makefile.aimk",the compiling fails.It would pass only if the make file was 
named "Makefile.aimk". So I modified the aimk file in order to succeed in 
compiling PVM programs by name "Makefile.aimk" or "makefile.aimk" on Nov.4 ,
1994.I send the fellowing improved aimk file to you .

I am currently using pvm.

I am doing research in robust control.  I use pvm for implementing parallel
algorithms used in robust control problems.  These types of algorithms
include optimization, controller formulation, and analysis problems.
Research utilizing large flexible space structures leads to robust control
problems of extremely high order that prohibit their being solved on a 
standard workstation with a sequential algorithm.  I am investigating parallel
versions of some of these algorithms for a practical engineering environment
that consists of several workstations without access to a dedicated parallel
supercomputer.  Pvm is the communication software for this research.

The machines in use are 8 Sun and 4 SGI workstations.

One quick suggestion. It would be nice if PVM could make a reasonable guess
at the relative speed term based on the architecture and machine model type.
That would mean the user wouldn't have to figure out those numbers 
themselves.

If I think of further comments I'll send them along later. Meanwhile keep 
up the good work.

Twenty (?). SUN's, (old) DEC (running Ultrix), PC with Linux or BSD/386,
recently Indy from SGI (POWER Challenge from SGI will be our next step).
> 
> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
We will enjoy any development in the area of the debugging support. The
debugging becomes the most difficult part of the whole development cycle
(and it is a heavy burden in our environment, where PVM is mostly used as
a tools for experimental computational chemistry). We would like to have
some possibilities to inspect the actual state of the PVM (messages,
buffers, ...), to log the transactions (to be inspected later) and so on.

On the other hand we are very gratefull for having the PVM -- it is
really very good pice of code and even as it is under continuous
development, it is very stable and usefull even when used for large and
long computations. Thank you.

Hi

Yes, I'm using PVM on Domain Decomposition techniques applied to CFD 
simulations. I'm also using BLACS and some ScaLAPACK routines. My work is
running on a farm of 4 DEC (3000) Alpha's AXP interconnect by a FDDI-based
GIGAswitch. 

With my best regards

Paulo.

Dear Sir

I am sorry for my late response to your survey, but I suppose 
you still appreciate an answer.

Currently I am using PVM in direct numerical simulations of 
partial differential equations describing two-dimensional 
random flow in a plasma. It is a multi-fluid simulation and
I therefore use a master/slave concept on a cluster of IBM
workstations, which works excellent. I am not able to compare 
PVM with other message passing libraries since it is the only 
system I have tried.

In the testing/developing period I used a heterogenous cluster
of one HP and two DEC workstations connected with internet.

I then moved the program to a national HPC resource consisting 
of 16 IBM-workstations connected with a FDDI net, without any 
porting problems.

I hope this is the information you are asking for. Feel free
to ask further questions if necessary.

Your Sincerely,
Baard Krane

Debugging is tough. The debugger seems to have trouble sometimes with

me how to get stderr to go somewhere I could see (from a fortran

I am using PVM (3.1 and 3.3 versions) for the development of
basic parallel algorithms for Computer Graphics.
We have PVM installed on the following machines:
- 12 IBM RISC/6000 workstations Ethernet-connected
- 3 IBM RISC/6000 workstations FDDI-connected
- 4 HP/6000 workstations Ethernet-connected
- 1 Intel iPSC/860 (16 nodes hypercube)
I found PVM very easy to use, exspecially for beginning with
parallel computing. However its implementation on the Intel
iPSC/860 gives few problems (related to the size of the message
buffer among nodes and between ``host'' - SRM - and nodes).

linear programming

Sun workstations, between 2 and 4

Any comments:
It would be nice to have information about how time-consuming
the different subroutines are. It took me quite a while to
figure out where most of the time is spent.

From: Steven Gibson <gibson@madraf.astro.wisc.edu>

Are you using PVM today?

  I am just learning how to implement PVM.  

What are your application(s)?

  The application is coarse-grained parallelization of the DDSCAT code
  by Draine & Flatau.  This code uses finite element techniques to model
  electromagnetic scattering properties of arbitrarily-shaped interstellar
  dust grains.  At some stage we may also attempt parallelization of the
  FFT part of the code.  

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

  Mike Wolff (U. Colorado) has been working on this for a while, running the 
  PVM DDSCAT code on workstation clusters.  I am joining him on the project 
  to try implementation on the Cray T3D at Pittsburgh; this parallel machine
  consists of 256 DEC-Alpha nodes connected in a 3-D torus geometry. 

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

  At this time I'm afraid I lack the experience to make any comments.

Have what will be several environmental simulations interoperate.
This is coordinated by the use of CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System).
PVM calls are made from programs written in C, Fortran and  
Smalltalk & CLIPS w/ C bindings.

> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
 ~a doz. sparc 10 or 20s and a SGI Crimson
 and someday an IBM SP1

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

I still ocasionaly have problems connecting up some machines.
I usually don't persue it, because I can find enough other machines to run on.
I've gone through some of the trouble shooting on this, but sometimes it just isn't
obvious why it doesn't work.

I like PVM, but one thing that could make use switch someday is finding something that
much more reliably (with ease)  starts up on several machines.

There are probably a few things that would be nice someday, but I am less
worried about them right now.


Thank you for the nice package, and I'd also like to say that I have appreciated
the friendly support.

Sincerely,
Mike B.

Hello!

We are evaluating PVM for use as a sublayer to a
high-level communication interface in a Multi Agent System Environment.
Special interest is in the group server facilities.
Questions concern realtime constraints like max. time limits for
messagepassing under heavy cpu load, different communicationmodes,
changes in net-topography at runtime and use of heterogenous architectures.

The Project is called MAKS "Multiagenten-Kommunikations-Subsystem"
and will have to provide flexible message formats and group-communication
while choosing and instanciating agents best suited to solve given tasks.
I will start coding for this project in about 2 months time.
Thanks for a really nice system.

Hello 

First sorry for my bad english.

I use pvm for a cooperative projet which
goal is to couple an atmospheric and an Oceanic
General Circulation Models on two distant Cray.

The two Cray are ip-connected through Renater
which is the french network for research and education
(34 Mb/s). One of the Cray was connected to Renater
through an fddi ring and then an ethernet network
and the other through an hippi switch and then ethernet
network.

While sending messages over than 200 reals a time, pvm
expired apparently due to time-out. It was not
so obvious to know it was due to a too big fragmentation
of frames send and that we had to adjust UPDMAXLENGTH
and to recompile pvm.
It is a pity that pvm is not able to know which networks are 
used and to have UDPMAXLENGTH correctly set but I guess
it is not easy to program.  You should perhaps  explain
better how to set UDPMAXLENGTH in documentation.

Dear Sir,
	Sorry fro the delay.  The replies to you questions :

	RE:	Are you using PVM today?

		no.

	RE:	What are your application(s)?

		grid generation package for computational fluid mechanics

	RE: How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

		SCO 3.2v4.2 on i80486	: 3
		LINUX 1.1.83 on i80486	: 1

	RE: Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

		I am using pvm3.3.5.
		I works fine on LINUX but..

		I had some problem while compiling and running it on SCO.
		I had to add -DNOWAIT3 flag in addition to those in SCO.def while compliling.

		While running, on typing pvm, I get the message 'terminated'.
		And this is what I have on /tmp/pvml.200
			[t80040000] ready  3.3.5   Sat Jan 21 21:37:03 1995
			[t80040000] evilsig() caught signal 11
			[t80040000] i_dump() 0 bytes total
			[t80040000] pvmbailout(-11)

		However, if I start pvmd3 in the background and then start pvm, it works.
		and /tmp/pvml.200 shows  :
			[t80040000] ready  3.3.5   Sat Jan 21 21:39:53 1995

		Another problem in my SCO is that /bin/rsh is linked to /bin/sh and hence its exactly a remote shell. 
		Though I liked PVM very much, I couldn't devote enough time to get it working on SCO.
		I would like to get in touch with other users running PVM on SCO 3.2v4.2.

Sorry for the delay, but we have read your message just today ...
We are a research group and we are interestead for new releases about PVM.
So we answer your questions:

 1) We are using PVM rel. 3.3.4

 2) This version of PVM is used to improve programs to resolve systems of 
    Volterra Integral Equation by using the methods Waveform Relaxations.

 3) We are using a cluster of IBM's Workstations RISC 6000.
 
In order to improve PVM, we suggest the implementation of some routines to 
control the time of communication, time of calculations and so on.

 
 Your help is much appreciated.

Dear PVM Project Team,


This mail is the reply to yours questions about our use of PVM.

>Are you using PVM today?

We use PVM in order to know the performance of this type of
environments in the development of concurrent discrete time
for the stadistical analysis of the output using replications method.

>What are yor application?

Our test application is based on SMPL discrete time simulator. The
application uses three kinds of processes: a user interface, a 
server daemon that controls replications, and N concurrent replications
(instrumented in order to transfer their status to daemon). Simulation
ends when the user-especified end conditions are reached.

Whe are planning to use this method in more complex simulators.

>How many and what kind of machines have you used whith PVM?

We are using 5 HP9000/735, connected through a FDDI network.

>... sugestions ...

We think that would be interesting to add a library for made easy the
load analysis of hosts in the virtual machine.


Congratulations  for PVM.

Dear Colleague,

Here is my response to the recently posted PVM survey.

*** Are you using PVM today? ***

Yes

*** What are your application(s)? ***

a) We have parallelized (using PVM) our finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) 
electromagnetic modeling code using domain decomposition; each slave takes a 
partition of the problem.  It is essentially a data-parallel algorithm, 
requiring us to communicate values between adjacent slaves at their interfaces 
(face, edge, or corner) every timesteps.  Despite the large amount of 
communication, it parallelizes quite well, mainly because communication 
increases with the surface area of the problem space while the computations 
scale as the volume.

b) We have parallelized a couple of our geophysical modeling programs that model 
wave propagation between boreholes.  The calculations are done in the frequency 
domain.  Each frequency is independent, so we parallelize on frequency using the 
 master/slave model; as a slave finishes calculating the result at one 
frequency, it is given another frequency to compute - easy load-balancing.  
After broadcasting global variables at the beginning of the run, only 3 numbers 
are communicated for each frequency.

*** How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM? ***

a) For the FDTD simulation, we have a single code which we have used on: IBM 
RS/6000, HP9000-700 series, SPARC2, SPARCserver 630MP, iPSC/860, and CM-5. This 
software works best on a homogeneous virtual machine.

b) For the geophysical applications, we regularly use a heterogeneous virtual 
machine consisting of 4 workstations: HP9000-433, HP9000-720, SPARC2 (one node 
of a 4-processor SPARCserver 630MP), and an old Sun4/260.

Debugging the code on the slaves was quite uggly.
And the memory consumption was very high. I had to transfer pieces
of images to and from the slaves. It seems that pvm buffers the
data 2 or 3 times, so that the slaves often had to swap, which
caused the algorithm to work fast only on quite small images.

But nevertheless, a great piece of code.

We use pvm for medical image processing.  We have about 8 Sparc-LX
machines and a few Sparc-20 connected in a local Ethernet LAN.
In the near future, some of the machine will be on ATM.  It seems
to me that pvm software has problem to be compiled in a SUNMP
architecture running solaris 2.3.

PVM is a useful software.  I wish someday its communication
speed can be improved.

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

SUGGESTION:

Functions to manipulate
contents/messages of send/received buffers like:
(1) prepend data to the active send buffer;
(2) concatenation of two packed messages from
    two send buffer;
(3) additional unpacking EXTRACT procedure(s)
    I mean,
    if user unpacks something from receive buffer
    then this part of message is EXTRACTED from
    buffer with following consequence:
	(a) as a result of extraction, message has been changed,
	(b) length of message in buffer has been decreased.

A undergraduate research project in numerical analysis with
Dr. Ben Leimkuhler at the University of Kansas. I am currently
developing a program to solve spin waves.  Simulating a piece of
magnetic tape as a pseudo 2-D surface of vectors(rods) pointing in the
direction of the rods spin axis.  There is heavy communication between
neighbor rods and the size of the blocks to break the computation into
needs to be optimized.  Space parallization is all I have implemented
so far, but I hope to get far enough to also implement time
parallization methods with multigrid.

When a task is spwaned, the output is put into a file (pvml...). It's OK,
but this is done only when the task exit (pvm_exit) so when you're debbuging,
you can't see what's happen.
(If there is a way to do that on PVM, don't take care of it.)

Dear Colleagues,
At first I want to answer the three questions:

No, I haven't used PVM during the last weeks. A few month ago I installed PVM on several workstations and tested it.
I found it working very well, but hard to develop PVM-programs.

In the (hopefully) near future I want to start programming a solver for large systems of linear equations using the PVM-system.
I'm especially interested in using PVM under LINUX.

I installed PVM on an DECstation5000(Ultrix), on 3 SGI Challenge(Irix), on 2  IBM/RS6000(Aix) and on an i486 under LINUX. 
All machines run very well,
at least the testing-programs, but I met a problem on the i486: It is impossible to add new machines to an virtual machine from
the i486, but it is possible to add the i486 to a virtual machine startet on one of the other workstations.

As I said, I'm interested in using PVM on a Cluster of PC's that will be installed at my site in the near future. My first (weak)
attempt to develop my own PVM-programs failed and I found the documentation of PVM not so helpful as it should be. I missed more
examples of numerical programs.

I'm shure that PVM has a great future.
Best wishes,
Michael Eilers

From: Patrick TESSIER <ptessier@matra-ms2i.fr>

We are currently developping a CASE tool that allow developper to
graphically specify
their parallel application program in such a way to define software objects
and communications between them.

The goal of that tool is to be able to fully describe the software without any
hardware deifnition nor constraints.

The hardware that will run the application software is also graphically define
such as processors boards connected on various kind of buses or hardware
platform. For example, you are able to specify a hardware composed of
multiple VME boards with one of them connected as a node to a PVM
bus together with a parallel supercomputer such as CAPITAN using message
passing communication and so on.

Code generators are part of the CASE tool and create the appropiate code
to run and to make all the software object (seen as subroutines) to communicate
together using the hardware platform that has been drawed.

Communication code is as close as the one a developper will have developped
by hand for the hardware he designed.

In such a tool, PVM is one of the communication system known by the
CASE tool along with direct shared memory communication or CAPITAN communication
primitives and others.

Our applications are mainly image and signal processing and use Real time
parallel system.
The CASE tool is a real time application specifier.

To day we have validate the PVM platform in our tool on SUN4 only, but we
plan to use other kind of Unix platform in the near future.

I hope that theses informations will be of some interest for you
and i still available for more detailed information on the CapCASE tool
product if you need it.

Primarily the parallelization of optimization packages, usually
by evaluating the gradient (via finite differences) in parallel.

>  How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
I have installed it on one cluster of 13 IBM RISC's, mostly
for testing, etc.  Real work is on 4 dedicated IBM 390 RISC's
devoted primarily to PVM.  We may be adding 2 or 4 more RISC's
to this "dedicated" cluster in the next year or so pending grant money.

Dear Sir or Madam

I hereby send you the reply to your three questions. Sorry about the delay.

1. Are you using PVM today?
   PVM and MPI (MPICH) are used on a regular bases although not daily by me.

2. What are your application(s)?
   i.  gaining an understanding of message passing
   ii. developing a parallel unstructured mesh generator for
       potential use in grand challenge problems.

3. How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
   i.   A network of approx. 12 SUN4 workstations.
   ii.  A dedicated ATM network of 4 SGI5 workstations
   iii. A 4-processor SGI Challenge (will be upgraded to 4 R8000 chips)
   iv.  The Edinburgh (UK) Cray T3D

Discussion are currently going on to switch completely to MPI.
One reason is the difference between network PVM and Cray T3D PVM.
A network MPI and Cray T3D MPI should be identical???
   
Yours sincerely

Well, hi to you too! :)

>In order to improve PVM we are trying to understand how
>people are using the system. Your feedback is important.
>Could you take a moment to answer three questions.

Sure, no problem. I would be very interested in the results as well. When will 
they be ready? 

>  Are you currently using PVM?

Yes, sort of. I'm just "evaluating" (i.e. experimenting with) it as a school 
project. That's why I'd be interested in the results of this survey. I'd like 
to mention in my own project report what sort of things people are using PVM 
for.

>  What are your application(s)?

Just a simple Mandelbrot fractal generator. The image is generated by 
identical slave processes running in parallel, each slave computing a 128x128 
pixel block of the image. The master program collects the blocks, displays 
them to the user and takes care of user I/O. Works very nicely, cool 
pictures... :)

>  How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

Well, I could use upto about 30-35 machines, but usually I use about a dozen 
machines. Most of them are SUN4SOL2s with a couple SUN4s and a few RS6Ks. 
SUN4SOL2s are in the local institute LAN, so I normally use just those, the 
rest are in the wider university network and usually too "crowded" to be worth 
adding to my PVM.

>  Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Well, I can't think of anything right now, I'll let you know if I come up with 
something. As a general comment, though, I have to say that PVM is a great 
piece of software, works just great! Keep it up!

While rather new at this, for sake of adding statistics...

I have just started working with PVM (nice set of documentation BTW)
and will be using it to investigate the design and implementation
of parallel algorithms with loosely-coupled processors.  I will
be comparing PVM to alternative methods including SMP, along with
a comparison of MIMD vs SIMD.

Initially I will be using PVM on a small Linux network and then
branch it to a network consisting of Alphas and Sparcs.  If a
Windows NT version doesn't exist, I'll be looking at getting the
source code running under NT, particularly on a multi-processor
NT machine.  Having ported realtime, socket applications to NT 
before I'm optimistic, although I've not looked at the source
code yet.  Ask me again after the first attempted compile :-)

Thanks for your library.  What I've seen so far is very promising
and I look forward to working with it.

     I have also tried (and failed) to use PVM on an Intel paragon.
There appears to be some incompatability between g++ (the only C++
compiler available for the paragon) and PVM.  For the record, the
stock master/slave example (made ANSI-compliant) compiles and runs
correctly using gdb, but locks-up on the first pvm call when the EXACT
same code is compiled with g++.

From: "Matthew H. Bassett" <bassett@ecn.purdue.edu>

I have not used PVM in the past year or so but have introduced at
least three people in the department to the power of PVM.  My first
experience with PVM was as a summer intern two summers ago when we
used PVM to parallelize a Monte Carlo batch facility simulation using
the in-house SGI's (16 processors) and Sun (2 processors)
workstations.

The people I have introduced PVM to have used it for Monte Carlo
molecular simulations and parallelizing XPS surface analysis.

From my summer experience I found a drawback was the inability for PVM
to realize that some of the SGI's used were multi-processor machines,
requiring me to spawn extra jobs on these machines manually.  Also the
speed variable never seemed to vary from architecture to architecture
or machine to machine.

Hope that this helps in the improvement of PVM.

Hello:

   The answer is:


       We are using the pvm software now.

       Our reseach area is the computer arquitecture, and we use the pvm 
       software for simulacion of routers. Also, we are interested in 
       distributed systems. In fact we are doing something similar to
       pvm with petri nets for to describe the program and annealing
       to distributing the load of system.

       We are a new group and in this moment we have 3 machines: a hp 735,
       a hp 715, and a dec alpha axp1. In the future we "grow up" the 
       computer's park with 5 new machines. We don't know the models yet.



       If you need something more, I'm happy to help you.

Jack & the Team,

Here comes my answers!

>   Are you currently using PVM?

Yes.

>   What are your application(s)?

I've implemented the most important (what ever they are!)  MPI calls
with PVM, so that our weather forecast code could make use of MPI
calling syntax during the development phase on IBM SP1. This work
was completed in August. Report is available soon and
a draft is available under http://www.csc.fi/faces/sami.html

I'm being completed with my Parallel Computing guide (written in Finnish)
which practically is fully based on PVM examples. 
(I will send you and Vaidy a copy when its ready; probably in March).

>   How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

A typically 4-8 machines / nodes from our 24-proc SP2 is allocated to
parallel jobs. They use PVMe 3.x.  But have individuals who run on
other platforms here too. Those systems are: 10 and 6 proc SGI Power
Challenge (R8000) with 2GB and 1GB of memory respectively; SGI-network
of couple of WSs; Convex C3840; Cray XMP-EA/464 (soon to be replaced
by Cray C94). Next year we will start to practice with ~200 node T3E,
too!

>   Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

The product is great. It's hard to find any weak points except
performance. But I feel that PVM on RISC-stations is a tool for
"proof-of-concept" and a "development platform" for fast
PVM implementations on the proprietary machines/networks like T3E.
Once your idea works on RISC-machines, you can safely transfer it
to faster systems with better performance.

But nevertheless, my wish list contains:

- Please have an option for combination of PvmDataInPlace + PvmDataRaw
- remove stride=1 limitation in PvmDataInPlace messages
- merge pvmd & pvm-group daemons since vendors seem to have done that, too.
  (f.e. on Cray T3D & Convex SPP)

Good luck!

rgds,

Sami

~~~> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
Workstations (IBM, DEC, HP), vector computers (Cray C94, C98), T3D and a 
virtual machine composed of all of them AND IT WORKS FINE !

~~~> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
Performance improvements are needed on tracing events with that beautefull 
tool called XPVM. Introducing Context, Static groups and faster heterogeneous 
encoding would surely improve PVM performance.

great tool! Keep up with it! It would be great, if the round trip time of
a message on clusters (without shared memory support) could be less than
the current app. 10 ms) and shared memory support could be built into the
versions vor Convex C series and Cray C90 series.

Dear colleague,

In response to you asking for feedback on the use of PVM,
I can tell you that:

- I'm currently using PVM for ray tracing applications
- I'm using a mixture of HP 300 and HP 700 machines (4 total),
  later maybe also a Parsytec running Parix

I think this is what you were asking for. Best regards. Erik.

Dear PVM Project Team,

I used PVM in my master's thesis (Diplomarbeit).

Its title was "Modelling Agents in a Destributed Robot System". My
master's thesis is a part of a project called KAMARA (KAMRO's
Multi-Agent Robot Control Architecture). KAMRO means the Mobile Robot
of Karlsruhe.

I used a network of about ten Sun workstations (SPARCstation 10 and
SPARCstation 20). The operating system was Solaris 1.1.1.

During my work I had the following problem, which is still not solved
sufficiently. My .cshrc starts with:

date
echo ">>> executing .cshrc ..."

On one hand these lines in my .cshrc are used by parts of my PVM
application which are implemented by other colleagues. On the other
hand the PVM deamon started on every part of the virtual machine has a
problem with these lines.

Do you have any idea how to solve my problem whithout changing the
foreign code of my colleagues? Can you perhaps solve the problem in a
later version of PVM?

Best wishes,

Martin Ruppert

Sir, Madam,

This in reply to your request concerning the use of PVM at our group:

Are you using PVM today?
------------------------
Yes, we do.


What are your application(s)?
-----------------------------

Computer simulations by means of finite element/finite volume methods
on parallel computers (T3D/SP2/Paragon/Cenju3).


How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
----------------------------------------------------------

We use PVM in two ways:

1) To distribute data in a Master-Slave environment. The master program
   runs on a front end to a parallel computer. The slaves are
   distributed on the processors of the parallel computer (SPMD
   programming model).  We do not run this programming model in a
   heterogeneous network, i.e. it runs exclusively on T3D/SP2/Paragon.

2) As a communication instrument for a distributed data manager
   (Client-Server concept). 

Thus, we use mostly CRAY-YMP's, Silicon Graphics and SUN's as server
platforms. The parallel computers are T3D, SP2 and Paragon.


Improvements
------------

One can of course always imagine all kinds of improvements. In what
follows I start from the idea that the functionality of PVM is not
modified. Improvements then mostly relate to speed:

1) We notice slow data transfer rates and high start-up (spawn) times
   on the CRAY-YMP/T3D environment. Remedy: ?

2) The XDR data conversion is very slow, especially when working with
   vector computers. Remedy: We have our own optimized tools and we
   run PVM in RAW mode with byte vectors.

3) Communication via daemons is slow (but very convenient!). I
   unfortunately do not know enough of operating systems to imagine how
   it could be improved while maintaining the concept.

I personally do not like the way the daemon has to be started and
managed (and killed here and there). I would appreciate if the PVM
daemon could somehow better be integrated in the operating system.


I am very much impressed by the quality of this public domain
program and the way it is distributed and installed. Thank you and the
PVM team!


I hope that these informations are of some use to you and I remain

Q.1 Are you currently using PVM ?
A.1 Yes.

Q.2 What are your application(s) ?
A.2 I am now working on the parallelization of a reflection tomography (or
    travel time inversion). It is a classical technique to obtain velocity and
    reflector information from seismic sections. The great advantage of
    raytracing, when compared for example with finite difference algorithms, is
    that it requests less computing time and memory. Furthermore, the
    parallelization of raytracing is relativly easy since a lot of computations
    can be executed separetly (one computation for one source and one
    reflector).

    The particulars points of this application are :
      * efficient even on loaded network (low unix priority)
      * low impact on interactive work during working hours (low unix priority)
      * dynamically configurable (able to handle addition or deletion of hosts
        during computation (use of pvm_notify and other configuration fonction)
      * fault tolerant (use of pvm_notify and other configuration fonction)
      * strategy of load balancing to overcome that an unique task on a crowded
        machine might remain during hours.

Q.3 How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM ?
A.3 Heterogeneous network of workstations :
      4 SUN SOLARIS
      1 SUN 2 processors SOLARIS.
      2 SGI OS 5.2
      1 SGI 2 processors OS 5.2.
      1 SGI OS 6.0

    Soon :
      RS/6000
      loosely coupled MPP (IBM SP2)


Comments :
  - pvm_notify must be apply to all task (created or to be created).
    It will be interresting to have one pvm_notify for global parallel virtual
    machine or a new flag in pvm_spawn to explicitly ask the notification.
  - In the User's Guide and Tutorial for Networked Parallel Computing, the
    use of struct pvmhostinfo array is not complete at allocation level in that
    way that it is not says if we can desallocate it.

     PVM Survey Feedback
     
     1.Are you using PVM today? Currently not using PVM. Have two networks 
     which are candidates for PVM. However, one of the networks has very 
     few UNIX machines on it, and they function as servers. Most machines 
     on the network are 486 class PCs operating under DOS; PVM didn't seem 
     like a good fit. Second network consists of UNIX machines, however it 
     is heavily loaded with applications jobs, and have been unable to 
     convince the organization owning that network that using PVM and 
     converting some of their spaghetti code applications to parallel 
     versions runing under PVM will rationalize network use and free it up.
     
     2.What are your application(s)? The principal application is SAR and 
     ISAR radar image processing and associated automatic target 
     recognition algorithms. Other applications involve neural net "mining" 
     of large distributed data bases.
     
     3.How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM? To date 
     the only machine used has been a single Sun workstation; the problem 
     with using PVM is that it operates under UNIX and most networked 
     computers at this company are PCs operating under DOS, so PVM's full 
     potential cannot be exploited. To exploit PVM's full potential in this 
     commercial environment would require a DOS based version running on a 
     PC. Price and performance of a DOS based PC is such that this 
     commercial LANs is populated with those type machines, and they meet 
     the bulk of requirements. Adding a software capability like PVM to the 
     LAN can be sold to management; replacing most of the machines with 
     UNIX workstations to achieve the PVM capability is perceived by 
     management as too expensive for an ill-defined benefit.

Dear The PVM Project Team,

I am sorry for a bit belated reply.
My name is Marie Oshima working at Institute of Industrial Science (I.I.S),
The University of Tokyo.  Mr. Matsuda, who is graduate student working 
for our research group has just started to learn PVM.

Here are answers to your question.

1. I am using PVM ver. 3.3.5. 

2. I am working on computational analyses of an incompressible flow using
   a finite element method.  I have developed an application of a 
   substructure method to a Pressure Poisson equation.  Since the
   substructure method divides an analysis domain to several sub-domains,
   I am implementing this method using PVM to exchange the information 
   on shared domain.

3. I installed PVM on the following machines:
   SUN SPARC 10 with Solalis 2.3 ( 2 machines)
   INDY Silicon Graphics ( 1 machine)
   HP 9000/720( 1 machine)
   CRAY EL 94( 1 machine)


I have just started to use it, but I am very impressed with all the work
that you put together. 
The materials such as PVM manual and quick reference are quite useful and
practical.  I can learn a lot studying the examples.  

I have two question:

1. When I try to add CRAY(host name:cognac) from another machine,
   for example, from SUN, I will get the following message.

pvm> add cognac
0 successful
                  HOST    DT ID
                cognac  Error 1

But if I try to add other machines from CRAY, it works.  I wonder why I
can not do it from other machines.

2. I can not compile and link  master1.f and slave1.f on HP using aimk.  
   We use HP-UX FORTRAN/9000 and OS 6.0.2.   

Thank you very much for your help.

Sincerely yours,

Marie Oshima

Dear Colleague,
i am very interesting to the PVM system. I knew it 2 years ago in a comparison
report between two environments for Parallel Programming: PVM and LINDA.

But i began to use PVM few months ago. My principal applications are FORTRAN
programs with a good level of vectorization but unfortunaly with a low level of
parallelism. I use PVM 3.3.5 under HENCE2.0 on a IBM RS6K Mod. 53H AIX 3.2.3
but i would like to use it in a multivendor environment composed by:

            one CDC ETA10Q vector machine undex Unix SYSV
            one CDC MIPS 4680 EP/IX
            one IBM RS6K Mod. 990 AIX 3.2.5
            two IBM RS6K Mod. 590 AIX 3.2.5
            two IBM RS6K Mod. 560 AIX 3.2.5
            one SGI INDIGO IRIX 4.0.5F
            a lot of Sparc Stations under Sun O.S. and Solaris.

Thank you from any future suggest you would send to me.

  Hi,
I work in France in a observatory of the CNRS (Centre Nationnal de Recherche 
Scientique/Nationnal Center of Scientific Research). 
We use PVM (version 3.3.4/5/6/7). Our applications are based on simulations 
N-Body. We have 2 Sparc Stations 10 bi processor (PVM_ARCH=SUNMP) and
1 Sparc Station 5 (PVM_ARCH=SUN4SOL2). I was in relation with 'manchek'
because I had a problem with PVM under solaris. The problem may be solved
in PVM 3.3.7. Thanks you very much for you help.

 I would like receive mail when there is a modification in PVM. Thank you.

   bye, JCL.

Hey, I've toyed with the PVM deal..but, I can't say I'm some wonder programmer
in code that is specific for it.  It would be kewl if you folks offered
like a REAL solid ongoing class/classes in it..not just some intro.

But, I certainly appreciate what you guys have already done..so keep it up.

Yes [although not me personally]

We have several graduate students here in the computer science department
using PVM.  Some are even incorporating PVM results into their thesis.

By this do you mean our usage of PVM?  Mostly instructional and research.
 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?

Currently only four machines.  They are a SUN 670MP, two SUN 4/280's,
and one SUN 4/110.  
 
Sorry for the delay in answering but it's been amazingly busy lately.

Artificial Intelligence -- we are building an inference engine utilizing 
multiple algorithms cooperatively, connected with PVM.

We have access to around 30 or 40 Sparc20s and 10 Sparc2s; our 
application currently only requires up to 10 systems at a time.

> Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
An option in the choice of which machines to spawn processes would be 
nice -- currently it is either pick your own or just step through the 
list; it would be nice to be able to let the processes be spawned based 
on the actual processor load, based on the type of machine (given an 
indicator of the magnitude of the task), etc.  Currently I have 
implemented a kludge to do the load-based assignment in my app, but it 
would be nice to have it in PVM.

I have also had problems with the PVM daemon overrunning its buffer in 
situations when I was passing large amounts of data -- I switch to 
routeDirect to solve the problem, but the daemon shouldn't die like that 
-- either it should just stop receiving (back up the sender), let them 
fall on the floor (let the error/resend code handle them) or dynamically 
expand its buffer to handle the load.  My app was sending on the order of 
200,000 34-byte packets in the space of a few minutes -- the slave daemon 
(on the machine with the app that was generating the packets) was the one 
that died.  Once I switched to RouteDirect, the sending app maintains a 
constant 32k send buffer, and the receiving app continuously has a 29-30k 
receive buffer!

Sorry, I hardly ever check this account.  Hope this
is still useful.

Are you using PVM today? No.

What are your application(s)?  I used PVM v3.3 to parallelize
a 2-D atmospheric chemistry model last summer.  The company
I was working for was trying to figure out whether to use
PVM or Linda.  In the full implementation, PVM was a little
faster but they liked Linda better because it was easier to code.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
We were running on a Sun MP and around 8 Sun 4's.

Any comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
The single biggest hassle with PVM was not being able to send 
and receive common blocks in Fortran.  It would be nice for the
speed-rates in the hosts file to work, too.  Otherwise, I liked 
PVM because commands were very explicit, it was more flexible and
had fewer cute metaphors than Linda, and the documentation 
was outstanding.

Are you using PVM today?
Yes

What are your application(s)?
I am working on a Distributed Lisp runtime, using a shared object space.
The communication platform is based on PVM. I am also working on a PVM
modification to support ordered messages between groups, using a relaxed
causality order.

How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
I am running it on Sun workstations and Linux (in my own notebook :-).

  Mainly scientific applications but some industrial codes are going to be ported 
  in paralle using PVM. We have several code running using PVM in the areas of
  Computational chemistry, Fluidodynamics, Mathematics and Engineering.
  We are strongly interested in using PVM to develop and port future scientific
  codes in parallel.
> 
> How many and what kind of machines have you used with PVM?
  About 25 machines including 8 nodes SP2, RS6Ks, ALPHAs & SUNs.
  (More details are available if needed...).

  We observe a strong request from the users to put their PVM codes (or vendor
  PVM codes) in PRODUCTION, that is, to have a queuing system capable of manage
  parallel jobs in a heterogeneous (both SW and HW) environment.
  While several queuing systems support PVM jobs, in my opinion, none of them
  fully integrate its capabilities and the management of parallel and serial
  jobs in a multiarchitecture computing system seems to be still a matter of
  study or knoledge of a specific site with specific application.
  May be an improvement of the PVM tool toward the parallel jobs management
  to give a fault-tollerant solution with one or more queueing system, could
  increase its acceptance as 'de-facto standard' message passing tool.

Hello all PVM maintainers out there.
 
This is some kind of (positive) feedback. I guess you are interested in ?

I use PVM regularly since version 2.4. So I don't want to express my best
impressions on the software itself. There's no doubt about that.
What's more, I am enthusiastic about the documents available. The PVM User's
Guide was a very useful and beneficial paper in my daily work by now. But a
few weeks ago I was told of the new PVM Book available on netlib. 
I skimmed through it at Easter. 
In my eyes, it's a great guide not only for new PVM users but also for
people who want to get familiar with parallelism. The PVM Book is a good
idea to get a first impression of programming schemes, pitfalls and things
to care of. The author's style, in particular, is really excellent. Compared
with other literature especially in German, the PVM Book is very easy to
understand and offers a quick benefit for practical problems. Its structure
and logic offers a fast access if special information is required.

I don't know who is the extremely talented one writing PVM guides and
manuals. But I want to thank her or him at this point. Because I know lots
of books which are so complicated to use (style, structure, language), I
want you to go on publishing such good work.


Best regards, 
Thomas.
