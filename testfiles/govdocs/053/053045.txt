                  NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING

     Adopted: May 5, 1999               ;  Released: May 14, 1999 

Comment Date:   July 6, 1999 
Reply Comment Date:  July 21, 1999  

By the Chief, Allocations Branch:

     1.  Before the Commission for consideration is a multiple docket Notice of Proposed Rule
Making setting forth separate proposals to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Section 73.202(b) of
the Rules.  Each petitioner has stated that it will apply for its requested channel, if allotted.  We
believe that each proposal warrants consideration because it complies with our technical requirements
and would serve the public interest.

     2.  This is a multiple docket Notice of Proposed Rule Making issued in response to a
Commission Public Notice released October 2, 1998 (DA 98-1987).  We are combining separate FM
allotment proposals into a single Notice of Proposed Rule Making.  Each proposal has its own docket
and rule making number and the Commission's Reference Center will maintain a separate file for each
docket. As discussed in the Public Notice, this procedure will conserve Commission resources and
expedite the processing of FM allotment petitions for rule making by avoiding duplicative actions.
We request comments and/or counterproposals to the following proposals:

A.  MM Docket No. 99-155, RM-9606      

Petitioner:    Gary Noel
          71536 Levi Lane
          Elgin, Oregon 97827      
               
Proposal:  Allot Channel 290A to Elgin, Oregon, as the community's first local aural service.
                    
          Community                Present        Proposed 

          Elgin, Oregon            --             290A

Additional Information:  This allotment does not require a site restriction.

B.  MM Docket No. 99-156, RM-9613

Petitioner:    Mountain West Broadcasting

          c/o Victor A. Michael, Jr. 
          President, Mountain West Broadcasting
          6807 Foxglove Drive
          Cheyenne, WY 82009

Proposal:  Allot Channel 256A to Pleasant Dale, Nebraska, as the community's first local aural
service.

          Community                Present        Proposed

          Pleasant Dale, Nebraska       --             256A

Coordinates  40-51-25 NL and 96-55-37 WL

Additional Information: This allotment requires a site restriction of 7.3 kilometers (4.5 miles) north
to avoid a short-spacing to 7.3 kilometers (4.5 miles) north to avoid a short-spacing to Station
KUTT, Channel 258C1, Fairbury, Nebraska.  Section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended, mandates that the Commission fairly, equitably, and efficiently distribute frequencies "
. . . among the several States and communities."  The Commission has defined "communities" as
geographically identifiable population groupings.  Generally, if a community is incorporated or is
listed in the U.S. Census, that is sufficient to satisfy its status.  Absent such recognizable community
factors, the proponent of a channel allotment must demonstrate the place to be a geographically
identifiable population grouping.  Revision of FM Assignment Policies and Procedures, 90 FCC 2d
88, 101 (1982).  Although the proponent of the allotment does not need to show that the borders of
the locality are precisely delineated, it must show that residents of the locality are commonly regarded
as a distinct group.  This can be proven by the testimony of local residents or by objective or
subjective evidence indicating the existence of a community.  Beacon Broadcasting, 2 FCC Rcd 3469
(1987), aff'd. 2 FCC Rcd 7562 (1987).  Some examples of objective indications of community status
include the existence of political, social, economic, commercial, cultural or religious organizations
and services in the community.  See Kenansville, Florida, 5 FCC Rcd 2663 (Policy & Rules Div.
1990), aff'd 10 FCC Rcd 9831 (1995).  We do recognize that Pleasant Dale is listed as a village in
the 1990 U.S. Census, and attributed with a population of 253 people.  However, we may find that
a population grouping of 253 people does not constitute a community for allotment purposes where
the community may be devoid of the customary factors associated with determining community
status, such as a library, schools, shopping centers, churches, a newspaper and social and civic
organizations.  See, Searles Valley, CA, 3 FCC Rcd 5221 (1988).  In past cases, we have rejected
claims of community status where a nexus has not been shown between the political, social and
commercial organizations and the community in question.  Therefore, petitioner is requested to
present the Commission with specific information to demonstrate that Pleasant Dale has the social,
economic and governmental indicia to qualify it as a community for allotment purposes.  See, Gretna,
Marianna, Quincy and Tallahassee, Florida, 6 FCC Rcd 633 (1991) and cases cited therein.  Petitioner
should show that the organizations, civic groups, etc., have a nexus with Pleasant Dale.  Failure to
provide the requested information will result in a denial of the proposal.
