NEW PARTS WERE IN AN UNAIRWORTHY CONDITION UPON RECEIPT.  BOTH ENDS OF THE TUBE HAVE SPRING LOADED POPPET VALVE	S IN CLOSED POSITION NOT ALLOWING FUEL TO TRANSFER.  THIS CONDITION CAME RIGHT OUT OF 1988 PKG OLD (NEW) PARTS.  DATA TA	GS DID NOT SHOW SHELF LIFE.  A RECOMMENDED SHELF LIFE SHOULD BE ON PART DUE TO O-RING'S & SEALS INSTALLED IN THE TUBE.	1	G	7	2 	3U				H13EU
