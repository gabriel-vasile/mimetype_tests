                to the Philippine Government's Bureau of the Coast and Geodetic

                Charles Sanders Peirce</font></b> is considered to be among the 
                greatest intellects that the United States has produced. The originality 
                and versatility of his thought have generated over 100 Ph.D. thesis, 
                30 books, and over 1,000 articles and chapters. There is a philosophical 
                society dedicated to his memory that publishes a quarterly journal 
                entitled the <u>Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society.</u>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  The bulk of Peirce's scientific work was accomplished during 
                  his years with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey between 
                  the years 1859 and 1891 although he remained active in the philosophical 
                  and scientific realm right up until his death in 1914. To give 
                  an idea of Peirce's scope of inquiry during his lifetime, he 
                  listed the following as his principal areas of research for 
                  Cattell's <u>American Men of Science</u> for 1906: "Logic, especially 
                  logic of relations, probabilities, theory of inductive and abductive 
                  validity; epistemology; meteorology; history of science; multiple 
                  algebra; doctrine of multitudes; gravity; wavelengths; phonetics 
                  of Elizabethan English; great men; ethics; phaneroscopy; cosmology; 
                  experimental psychology; physical geometry, -- foundations of 
                  mathematics; classification of science; code of terminology; 
                  topical geometry." </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Reading the above mind-numbing list doesn't begin to do justice 
                  to Peirce's intellectual accomplishments. He was the first to 
                  attempt to determine the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy from 
                  his studies of the brightness of stars by what he termed `photometric 
                  researches' during years of cooperative work with the Harvard 
                  Observatory; he was the first to relate the length of the meter 
                  to the wavelength of light thereby establishing a standard that 
                  could never be lost; when he attended meetings of the International 
                  Geodetical Association at Paris in 1875 he became the first 
                  American citizen to represent the United States at an international 
                  meeting of the physical sciences; and, at that same meeting, 
                  Peirce established for himself and the Coast and Geodetic Survey 
                  international respect and renown as he correctly pointed out 
                  an error in the European method of gravity observations. He 
                  was the founder of the branch of philosophy termed pragmatism; 
                  the first modern experimental psychologist in the Americas; 
                  the first to conceive the design and theory of an electric switching 
                  computer; and the first to consider the branch of economics 
                  dealing with the "economy of research." </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Peirce was born into an environment that encouraged intellectual 
                  attainment. His father was Benjamin Peirce, a Harvard professor 
                  of Natural History and Mathematics. Benjamin was a leading mathematician 
                  of the 19th Century and became the Superintendent of the Coast 
                  and Geodetic Survey in 1867. When Charles was growing up, his 
                  home was filled with the likes of Longfellow, Emerson, and Agassiz 
                  discussing their work and the scientific and philosophical issues 
                  of the day. His father imbued Charles with a love of philosophy, 
                  logic, and mathematics. Charles went to Harvard and graduated 
                  in 1859. He then entered on duty with the Coast Survey as an 
                  aid. </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Over the next few years he saw varied duty and also lectured 
                  at the Lowell Institute and Harvard on the `Logic of Science.' 
                  He also studied under Louis Agassiz at the Lawrence Scientific 
                  School and graduated summa cum laude in 1863, the first individual 
                  to graduate with honors. From 1867 to 1869 he was on assignment 
                  to the Harvard Observatory and then in 1870 he was sent on an 
                  expedition to the Mediterranean Sea to observe a solar eclipse. 
                  For several months during 1872, he was designated Assistant-in-Charge 
                  of the Coast Survey Office. Then in late 1872 he was directed 
                  "to take charge of the Pendulum Experiments of the Coast Survey" 
                  and to "investigate the law of deviations of the plumb line 
                  and of the azimuth from the spheroidal theory of the earth's 
                  figure." The next 8 years were the zenith of Peirce's scientific 
                  work in the Coast Survey. It was during this period that he 
                  attained international renown as a geodesist, made pioneering 
                  studies of the shape of the Milky Way, and used the wavelength 
                  of light to define the length of the meter. </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  The following decade was much less stellar. His father died 
                  in 1880. He was divorced from his first wife in the early 1880's, 
                  the administration of Julius Hilgard as Superintendent of the 
                  Coast Survey was scandal-wracked, and following Hilgard, Frank 
                  Thorn, a political appointee with no scientific background, 
                  was appointed as head of the Survey. It is probable that all 
                  of these factors contributed to a lackadaisical attitude towards 
                  his work and outright antagonism towards the administration 
                  of the Survey. </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  The inevitable occurred when Peirce tendered his resignation 
                  dated December 31, 1891. Although he had spent over 30 years 
                  in the Survey, there was no retirement in those days and he 
                  spent the remainder of his life in near poverty. He wrote many 
                  scholarly articles on a free lance basis, translated rare mathematical 
                  and scientific manuscripts from Latin, French, and German, and 
                  wrote mathematics textbooks. </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Charles Peirce died April 19, 1914. He had spent his life immersed 
                  in questions of truth and reality. He believed that truth or 
                  reality in science "is a limit approximated ever more closely 
                  by an infinite community of investigators working indefinitely 
                  into the future." This concept is pertinent in NOAA Corps today 
                  as we are part of that infinite community helping to search 
                  for the reality of global climate change, the nature of tides 
                  and currents, the truth concerning the optimal management of 
                  our fisheries stocks, and ever more accurate views of the seafloor.
