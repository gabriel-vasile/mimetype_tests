Papers at the symposium, by Blachut and Müller, and Konecny and Arnold (Gunning, 1966), reported on some of the developments at that time. The subsequent 20 years saw major developments in the large-scale mapping of Canada’s glaciers, in which the Photogrammetric Research Section of the National Research Council of Canada (PRS-NRCC), the Department of Surveying Engineering of the University of New Brunswick, and the Glaciology Division of Environment Canada were the most significant contributors. A discussion of the maps produced by these agencies and others permits a general review of the growth and decline of this activity but does not necessarily reflect the overall history of glacier studies in Canada. In addition, there has been a replacement of the old system of mapping with a use of DEM and satellite images. Many of these maps appear in journal articles or reports and are in digital format.Glacier Maps of Canada (1:1,000,000 Scale) The decision to map Canada’s glaciers at a scale of 1:1,000,000 arose from the need of the Geographical Branch, Department of Mines, to have small-scale maps available that were suitable for planning glaciological research and accurately depicting the geographic distribution of glaciers. A study was made in the middle 1960’s on the representation of glaciers on topographic maps published at various scales, particularly how glacier information was generalized. Glaciers were delineated with heavy black-ink lines on the best available maps in 1965 and reduced to the common scale (Falconer and others, 1966). One surprise from the study was the conclusion that small-scale maps may depict glaciers better than large-scale maps (see fig. 2 in Falconer and others, 1966). The three maps of the western cordillera show glaciers in purple on a white background (a combination that was thought to give the best visual contrast, even for small glaciers), whereas on the four Arctic maps, glaciers are white on a brown background (Henoch and Stanley, 1968a, b, 1970; table 1). The maps have been used to complement the standard topographic maps (Henoch, 1969) primarily for plotting information such as glaciation levels, equilibrium lines, ice-cored moraines, transient snowlines, and glacier mass balance (Østrem, 1973; Miller and others, 1975); as base maps for the National Atlas of Canada (see Fremlin and Mindak, 1968); and for use in schools.Glacier Atlas of Canada (1:500,000 Scale)Much more detailed information on all glaciers was subsequently compiled through the Canadian glacier inventory. Until 1972, identification numbers and basin designations were published in individual sheets of the Glacier Atlas of Canada. Modified 1:250,000-scale National Topographic System (NTS) maps formed the basis for the four-color plates. Glaciers appear in a blue vignette within their hydrological basins, and the maps are bordered in brown (fig. 1). Ommanney (1980) described the program, and the maps published (Ommanney, 1989) are listed in table 2. The series was used in compiling the base map (1:2,000,000 scale) for the 5th edition of the National Atlas of Canada, published at a scale of 1:7,500,000 on which glaciers are shown with a light purple vignette (Gosson, 1985), and subsequently for educational maps (Royal Canadian Geographical Society, 1998).FN3:    The 6th edition of the National Atlas of Canada is available online at the following URL address: [http://atlas.gc.ca/].Water Survey of CanadaIn 1945, the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, forerunner of the Water Survey of Canada (WSC), began annual surveys of 15 glaciers in western Canada to determine the effects of glacier variation on river runoff. The lower limits and activity of the glacier termini were measured from fixed points, and the movement and height change of the glacier surface were determined along a transverse profile of plaques in the ablation area. Glacier photographs and sketches of the relative changes were included in the annual reports of the district engineers, and some results were reported by Collier (1958). In 1950, the surveys became biennial and some surveys were terminated.In 1959, the WSC carried out an aerial photogrammetric survey of Athabasca Glacier; this was followed in 1962 by the University of New Brunswick terrestrial survey undertaken by Konecny (1964). The WSC decided that the latter technique was the most cost-effective and adopted it for future surveys of the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Glaciers in Alberta (1963 to 1979) and the Bugaboo, Kokanee, Sentinel, Sphinx, and Nadahini4 Glaciers in British Columbia (1964 to 1978). Paterson (1966) assessed its accuracy and Reid (1973) discussed the procedures used. Maps were plotted at scales of 1:10,000 to 1:2,500 with topographic contours at 5 to 10 m on the ice, depending on glacier size (table 3). The biennial volumetric changes were also calculated and the maps and results published (Reid and Charbonneau, 1980, 1981). The map styles vary but generally use solid blue for ice, blue stipple for snow with blue-line contours on the glaciers; brown or gray contours are used outside the margins of the glacier. Only the exposed ice in the ablation area is mapped, however. Surveys of all these glaciers were terminated by 1980 (Reid, 1973; Reid and Charbonneau, 1980, 1981).FN4: The names in this section conform to the usage authorized by the Secretariat of the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographic Names (CPCGN); URL address: [http://GeoNames.NRCan.gc.ca/].

Initially involved with the University of Toronto International Geophysical Year (IGY) Expedition, they developed and applied aerial photogrammetric techniques appropriate for mapping the lower part of Salmon Glacier (1:25,000/20 m),5 British Columbia, and its terminus (1:12,500/20 m).5 The color maps (five discrete colors) were published in conjunction with a detailed report on the survey by Haumann (1960). The photogrammetric base was used for assessing volumetric changes between 1949 and 1957. Details of these and subsequent maps discussed in the following paragraphs are shown in table 4.FN5:  Scale of map and contour interval on the glacier.Glacier Maps of the High ArcticAfter PRS-NRCC concluded the Salmon Glacier project, it became involved with the Jacobsen-McGill University Arctic Research Expedition to Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut. This collaboration led to a remarkable set of maps, compiled using aerial photogrammetric methods; most of the maps were included in the report by Müller and others (1963). The Thompson Glacier Region map (1:50,000/25 m)5 (fig. 2) was the first of its kind in Canada to combine eight colors, bedrock portrayal, and shading to create a strong visual impression of the landscape (McKortel, 1963). Large-scale glacier maps were made of Crusoe Glacier Tongue, Baby Glacier, and the Thompson Glacier terminus (1:5,000/5 m)5 (fig. 3). All of White Glacier, the focus of the expedition’s glaciological work, was mapped and printed in two colors (1:10,000/10 m),5 and its terminus only (1:5,000/5 m)5 in six colors (Haumann, 1963; McKortel, 1963). The maps were used as a base for much of the scientific work of the expedition (Blachut, 1963a, b; Blachut and Müller, 1966). An overview was provided by a smaller scale map of the expedition area (1:100,000/100 m).5 In a subsequent experiment in the use of terrestrial photogrammetry for mass-balance determination, Arnold (1977, 1981) mapped the lowest 2 km of the White Glacier (1:2,500/5 m).5To the west, the Surveys and Mapping Branch, Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the Polar Continental Shelf Project mapped Meighen Island (1:50,000/10 m)5 and its ice cap (1:25,000/5 m),5 using aerial photography taken 1 year apart (see fig. 9B in Glaciers of the High Arctic Islands in this volume), and compared the changes. An aspect not seen on any other Canadian glacier maps is that both the surficial and subglacial topography are contoured. The maps are multicolored and have been described by Arnold (1966).On Ellesmere Island, the surging Otto Glacier was mapped twice by the Defence Research Board (1:50,000/10 m)5 and the results reported by Konecny (1966). The terminus of d’Iberville Glacier was mapped (1:50,000 scale), but not contoured, in a project aimed at measuring displacement values of a tidewater glacier (G. Holdsworth, 1977; unpub. data). The changes in the ice shelves along the northern coast, surveyed and mapped by Jeffries and Serson (1986), did not result in a published topographic map (see subchapter on Ellesmere Island Ice Shelves and Ice Islands in this volume). In Hare Fiord, part of the ice tongue position in 1958 has been plotted against the 1978 position (Römmer and Hell, 1986). In southern Baffin Island, collaboration between Gunnar Østrem and the college in Iqaluit led to the mapping and publication of part of the Grinnell Glacier by Norges Vassdrags- og Energiverk (NVE) (1991) (fig. 4).IHD Glacier MapsCanadian participation in the International Hydrological Decade (IHD) included mass- balance investigations on several glaciers in western Canada and the north for which metric maps at a scale of 1:10,000 with 10-m contours were required. Those of the Berendon, Place, and Sentinel Glaciers were printed in four process colors; in addition, the maps of Ram River and Woolsey Glaciers, both in National Parks, were embellished with shaded relief. The Peyto Glacier map is discussed later. The map of Decade Glacier, Baffin Island (1:10,000/10 m)5 was not printed. Two maps were made of Per Ardua Glacier, Ellesmere Island, by Konecny (1966): the entire glacier (1:20,000/10 m)5 and its tongue (1:5,000/5 m).5 Maps of the Barnes Ice Cap were prepared by the Surveys and Mapping Branch as 1:50,000-scale NTS maps. Some were Arctic Provisional Maps with black contours, blue hydrography, and 25-ft contours; others were standard NTS maps with the ice shown in a blue vignette and dashed- brown 50-ft contours.The original intent was to remap all IHD glaciers after the 10-year program was concluded to compare the accumulated mass balance with photogrammetrically determined volumetric change. This was not done, nor are there any plans to do so now. However, all glaciers in an east-west transect from Ram River Glacier to Sentinel Glacier were photographed almost simultaneously (22 to 24 August 1966). Some of the detailed glacier maps mentioned above and in tables 3 and 4 were compiled from this aerial photography. One of the objectives of the aerial photography was to map simultaneously the elevation of the transient snowline along the east-west transect (Østrem, 1973).Miscellaneous Maps of Western CanadaMany individual glaciological projects require accurate maps for plotting results and determining changes in the glaciers. This was recognized quite early when the American Geographical Society (AGS) (1960) embarked on a project to map nine glaciers in North America, one of which was the Little Jarvis Glacier in the St. Elias Mountains, in a project that has been described in Brandenberger and Bull (1966). The AGS also sponsored termini mapping in Alaska by Bill Field that included the Grand Pacific Glacier, a Canadian glacier at the head of Glacier Bay (Field, 1966). Subsequent work in this region has resulted in a more general map of this glacierized area (Molenaar, 1990). Steele Glacier, which surged during the Yukon Centennial Expedition of 1967, was mapped from 1951 aerial photography (1:50,000/25 m; 1:25,000/20 m)5 and 1967 photography so that its velocity vectors could be plotted (Stanley, 1969). A four-color map of the Centennial Range (MCR-7, 1:125,000/500 ft),5 that followed this expedition, had details of glaciological features normally omitted from NTS maps. Other surging glaciers in the Yukon and northern British Columbia have attracted considerable attention. The Army Survey Establishment compiled a map of Rusty Glacier (1:10,000/10 m).5 In 1983, Nadir Mapping Corporation prepared a map of Trapridge Glacier (1:10,000/10 m)5 for Garry K.C. Clarke, University of British Columbia.Two maps of Tweedsmuir Glacier (1:50,000/20 m),5 before- and after- surge, were produced under the direction of Gerald Holdsworth from 1951 aerial and 1974 terrestrial photography; the former was published in three colors. Finally, a three-color map of Lowell Glacier (1:50,000/20 m)5 with moraine shading was prepared from 1974 photography in anticipation of a surge (see fig. 11 in Quantitative Measurements of Tweedsmuir Glacier and Lowell Glacier Imagery in the section about Glaciers of the St. Elias Mountains in this volume).The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research (FGER), in collaboration with the Technical University of Hannover, Germany, has included mapping with its other studies of Cathedral Glacier near Atlin (1:5,000/5 m)5 (Cialek, 1977; FGER, 1976; Mauelshagen, 1984; Mauelshagen and Slupetzky, 1985; Slupetzky and others, 1988). A map of the northwest col of Mount Logan with hachured bedrock and relief shading (1:10,000/20 m)5 was compiled in 1976 (Holdsworth and others, 1976) in connection with an ice core deep-drilling project there by Gerald Holdsworth of the Glaciology Division. It was subsequently modified in 1992 to include an area targeted for drilling in 2001 (Holdsworth and others, 1992). Two maps of the Mount Logan massif (1:75,000/40 m and 1:100,000/40 m)5 were produced by Holdsworth and Sawyer (1993).A joint project between the British Columbia Institute of Technology and Karl Ricker (1977) resulted in a map of Wedgemount Glacier (1:5,000/10 m).5One of the finest North American examples of the cartographer’s art is The Massif of Mount Hubbard, Mount Alverstone, and Mount Kennedy map (1:31,680/100 ft),5 produced by the National Geographic Society with field surveys by the University of New Brunswick (Washburn and others, 1965; Washburn, 1971a, b). The two-color map with hachured bedrock and relief shading is a visual delight (fig. 5).Peyto Glacier and Columbia IcefieldIn 1970, a map of Peyto Glacier, Alberta, was published in nine colors using the French technique of bedrock portrayal (Sedgwick and Henoch, 1970) (1:10,000/10 m).5 Subsequently, it was decided to experiment with the enhancement of this map to create a three-dimensional visual effect using the Swiss technique of hachured bedrock portrayal and shaded relief (Henoch and Croizet, 1976). The resultant map, published in 1975 at the same scale as the original edition, was printed in eight colors and accompanied by an explanatory booklet with the ensemble designed to cater to the scientist, teacher, and the general public.Following the success of the Peyto Glacier map, it was decided to experiment with a larger glaciological unit and a smaller scale, though continuing to apply the same cartographic techniques. The Columbia Icefield was selected as a joint project with Parks Canada in 1976. In 1981, a ten-color map with hachured bedrock portrayal, shaded relief, and interpretive information on the reverse side was published (1:50,000/20 m).5Orthophoto MapsBlachut and Müller concluded in 1965 that the orthophoto map would probably find extensive use in glaciological work (Blachut and Müller, 1966). Canadian experience has shown a trend toward this, although few of the resultant maps have been published or distributed widely. Once again PRS-NRCC has been a pioneer, producing stereo-orthophoto maps of Axel Heiberg Island glaciers in collaboration with Environment Canada and the Technical Universities of Vienna and Zürich: White Glacier (1:10,000/20 m),5 Thompson Glacier and White Glacier termini (Institute of Cartography, 1998) (1:5,000/10 m)5 (fig. 6), Crusoe Glacier terminus and Baby Glacier (1:5,000/10 m).5 To the east, a map of Oobloyah Bay (1:25,000/25 m)5 was prepared as a base map for the Heidelberg-Ellesmere Island Expedition 1978 (Hell, 1981).In western Canada, the British Columbia Institute of Technology compiled a map of Wedgemount Glacier (1:10,000/20 m).5 A stereo-orthophoto map of Peyto Glacier (1:10,000 scale) was prepared as part of a pilot study for the Forest Management Institute, Environment Canada, by Gestalt International, Ltd. Contours were not plotted on the map, but the elevation data were analyzed from the digital terrain model, which was a byproduct of the stereophotogrammetric-compilation process (Young and Arnold, 1978). The Gestalt system was further tested in the construction of three maps of the Columbia Icefield (1:25,000 scale) by the Surveys and Mapping Branch for the Glaciology Division using 1977 photography (Athabasca Glacier, Saskatchewan Glacier, Athabasca and Saskatchewan Glaciers). A larger scale map of Athabasca Glacier (1:5,000 scale), based on 1980 photography, was produced for the latter agency by Orthoshop of Calgary as part of a study of photogrammetric applications to mass-balance measurements.Satellite MappingWhile the immediate future technology for glacier mapping in 1965 was the orthophoto map derived from aerial photographs, the current and future technology is based on satellite images and other remote-sensing devices (for example, satellite laser altimetry). Significant improvements in resolution (1-m pixel resolution of Ikonos) combined with stereo and all- weather capabilities [Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)] make this technology increasingly viable. The Surveys and Mapping Branch used Landsat images to revise their 1:250,000-scale NTS maps. Experiments have been carried out on the viability of using existing images to update glaciological information (Howarth and Ommanney, 1983), and some attempts were made to map with this technology (Sidjak and Wheate, 1999). The full range of potential applications has been documented in this volume and other volumes in the U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1386, Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World.Mapping Glaciers in the Interior Ranges and Rocky Mountains with Landsat DataBy Roger D. Wheate, Robert W. Sidjak, and Garnet T. WhyteAbstractThe areal extent and glacier facies of glaciers in Canada can be mapped effectively and monitored using satellite imagery especially where accessibility, size of ice mass, and large number of glaciers are limitations to conventional surveying methods. Glacier delineation, glacier facies, and surface details are enhanced by the use of specialized digital-imaging and analytical techniques, notably principal components analysis, the TM 4/5 ratio, and a normalized difference snow index (NDSI). The two examples illustrated here depict the glacier facies of the Illecillewaet Glacier, Columbia Mountains, Interior Ranges, British Columbia, and the retreat of the Monkman Glacier/Parsnip Glacier, Peace River, British Columbia, over a period of approximately 10 years. Retreat of glaciers in western Canada is clearly detectable using Landsat imagery with its good spatial resolution and decades of data acquisition, beginning with the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1) on 23 July 1972. Three-dimensional perspectives can be produced by combining satellite images and digital elevation models.IntroductionGlacier retreat represents a substantial change that is occurring in the Coast Mountains, Interior Ranges, and Rocky Mountains in western Canada. Topographic maps are revised at irregular intervals, but changes in areal extent of many Canadian glaciers and glacier facies may be significant on an annual basis. Glaciers in these mountains appear on 1:50,000- and 1:250,000-scale National Topographic System (NTS) and other map sheets. However, many of these sheets are based on glacier extent in the 1970’s and 1980’s and, thus, are generally outdated. Despite considerable cloud cover, it is usually possible to obtain cloud-free satellite images of western Canada during most years.British Columbia Provincial MappingGlacier margins in digital format at the 1:250,000 scale for the Province of British Columbia (BC) were created in 1996 and are available to the public. The entire province has also been mapped at a scale of 1:20,000, using stereo aerial photogrammetric methods, as part of the Terrain Resource Inventory Management (TRIM) Program, which was completed between 1985 and 1996. Digital thematic datasets (layers) include glacier margins, but the accuracy of the glacier outlines may not always be reliable because of (1) masking by residual snowpack and (2) lack of experience in glacier mapping by cartographers whose primary experience is in forest-cover mapping. These two sources of error produced maps of glaciers that were initially incorrect and only become more so because of subsequent glacier changes in the more than 15 years since the mapping program began.A second generation of mapping designed to update the changes since 1985, known as TRIM II, was begun in 1998 and is still in progress. Within the TRIM II program, orthophotographs have been produced for each 1:20,000-scale digital map quadrangle, each of which covers 12 min. longitude by 6 min. latitude (approximately 13 km x 11 km); there are 100 1:20,000-scale quadrangles in each 1:250,000-scale NTS sheet. However, an initial evaluation of some of these new data indicate that the use of early-summer aerial photography precludes the precise determination of glacier margins (concealment by snowpack). Hence, glacier-extent maps and precise location of ice-front positions for western Canada do not exist unless the glaciers were the subjects of special studies, such as Luckman and others (1987) (see also tables 1 and 4), which may now also be as dated as the first TRIM data.The TRIM programs included the production of a digital elevation model (DEM), which contains sampled points from digital aerial stereophotogrammetry at approximately 50–70 m intervals along north-south transects, producing a 20-m contour interval. In many cases, the frequency of points decreases on glaciers because of the inability to determine elevation location under conditions of no contrast (for example, on a snow-covered glacier). Therefore, elevational inaccuracies are common in the accumulation areas of glaciers. Uncertainty in the accuracy of the DEM also complicates the calculation of the position of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). Lodwick and Paine (1985) experimented with deriving elevation data directly from Landsat MSS data for the Barnes Ice Cap by applying principal components analysis (PCA) and utilizing the information contained in the lower components. However, their encouraging results have not been pursued with the higher resolution and spectral range of either Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data.Satellite Image DataSatellite imagery offers the dual advantages of repetitive coverage and multispectral remote sensing for updating glacier maps. The first increases the likelihood of obtaining cloud-free and snow-free scenes in mountainous areas at the latitude of western Canada and proximity to the coast, a region which typically experiences both frequent cloud cover and remnant snowpack most of the year. Ideally, satellite images are best obtained at the end-of-the-melt season, in late August to early September, to minimize snow cover, while avoiding shadows cast by the lower Sun angles in the autumn. Landsat TM data have so far offered the best combination of spatial resolution and spectral selection compared to other available sensors, such as the Système Probitoire d‘Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites, especially the inclusion of mid-infrared (IR) wavelength bands. The potential role of these bands [TM bands 5 (1.55mm–1.75mm) and 7 (2.08mm–2.35mm)] is based on the lower reflectance of snow and ice, in comparison to the higher reflectance and often complete saturation in the visible wavelengths. Landsat data have been shown to be effective in the mapping of the areal extent of glacier facies, including ice, wet snow, and snow (Williams, 1987; Williams and others, 1991). The 30-m picture-element (pixel) resolution has proven to be adequate here for monitoring glaciers with an area of 10 km2 and greater, and for changes over periods of 4–5 years, as was also determined by Bayr and others (1994) in the Austrian Alps and for longer time periods in Iceland (Williams, 1986; Hall and others, 1992; Williams and others, 1997).Digital-Image Processing for Glacier MappingChallenges facing the automated mapping of glacier areas include discrimination of the glacier facies, identification of debris-covered ice, topographically and cloud-shadowed areas, and water bodies marginal to the glaciers. Although glacier margins can be readily discerned visually using an optimum color composite of TM bands 3 (0.63mm–0.69mm), 4 (0.76mm–0.90mm), and 5 [or one in each part of the visible (0.4mm–0.7mm), near-IR (0.7mm–1.5mm), and mid-IR (1.5mm–8.0mm) wavelengths], the following image spectral bands and processes have been shown to greatly increase delineation of glacier facies and margins (Sidjak and Wheate, 1999).PCA has been employed to reduce data redundancy due to correlation between TM bands and to enhance contrast in features of interest. The second principal component (PC2) is usually influenced by the mid-IR bands 5 and 7 and cleanly isolates glacier from nonglacier surfaces, unless the surface is covered with morainic material. PC4 displays more detail on the glacier surface than any of the TM bands; this has been suggested to be related to snow grain size (Brugman and others, 1996). The second component (PC2) can also be used to generate a mask to eliminate nonglacier surfaces in further analysis.Pixel saturation is recognized as a typical problem over glacierized and snow-covered scene areas, particularly in the visible bands [Landsat TM bands 1 (0.45mm–0.52mm), 2 (0.52mm–0.60mm), and 3 (Hall and others, 1988)]. PCA reduces this problem by identifying most of the scene-brightness variance, and thus the saturation, within the first principal component (PC1). Subsequent principal components, especially the second, third, and fourth, usually depict strong, unsaturated contrast over the glacier areas, enhancing surface features and facies. Further image processing has involved the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) (Riggs and others, 1994) where NDSI = (TM2–TM5)/(TM2+TM5). The TM4/TM5 ratio has also been cited by Hall and others (1987) as effective for discriminating the ice-and-snow facies, particularly in areas of shadow.Illecillewaet Névé and Illecillewaet Glacier Illecillewaet Glacier (lat 51º14'N., long 117º27'W.) is the best known glacier in Glacier National Park, Columbia Mountains, east of the town of Revelstoke, B.C., and directly accessible from the Trans-Canada Highway. In the early 20th century, it formed the backdrop to a mountain lodge and was a popular climbing attraction. Champoux and Ommanney (1986) studied the evolution of Illecillewaet Glacier using historic data, aerial photography and satellite imagery. This study uses the above Landsat combination (TM4/TM5 ratio) of spectral bands to classify the following glacier facies and give the best estimate of transient snowline and equilibrium line location: snow (accumulation area), bare ice (ablation area), from which the accumulation-area ratio (AAR) can be calculated (see table 5); water, shadowed glacier, and debris-covered ice (recognized as a significant challenge in glacier-inventory mapping by Whalley and Martin, 1986). The Landsat 5 TM false-color composite image (50440240094230T0; bands 3, 4, 5; 18 August 1994; Path 44, Row 24) is shown in figure 7. The computer-classified image is draped on the B.C. provincial DEM in figure 8A, as viewed from the northwest, a similar direction from the ground photograph (fig. 8B). Snow (accumulation area) is shown in white, bare ice in dark blue, and firn/wet snow in medium blue. There are a few scattered clouds on the south end of the icefield (white on figure 7).Monkman Glacier/Parsnip Glacier The Monkman Glacier/Parsnip Glacier (lat 54º30'N., long 121º30'W.) is the largest of a group of glaciers in the front ranges of the Rocky Mountains, about 100 km northwest of the city of Prince George, B.C. (see discussion of Hart Ranges in the Glaciers of the Canadian Rockies section); access to this area is very difficult except by helicopter. Comparison of image data from 23 September 1997 with the B.C. TRIM contour maps from the middle 1980’s shows a decrease in glacier area from 24.8 to 23.2 km2 and ice-front retreat ranging between about 100–200 m. Figure 9 shows a Landsat 5 TM false-color composite image (50480220097266T0; bands 3, 4, 5; 23 September 1997; Path 48, Row 22) overlain with 100-m DEM contours and includes the equilibrium line in white. The green line from the TRIM contour maps indicates the approximate areal extent of the glacier in 1986. Smaller ice patches that are not visible in dark shadow indicate some complications of using satellite images for glacier mapping and emphasize the need for derived products such as principal components and ratios to compensate for topographic shadows. Figure 10A depicts the same image (without contours), draped over the provincial DEM. Figure 10B is a ground photograph of the Parsnip Glacier.AcknowledgmentsThe Illecillewaet Névé/Illecillewaet Glacier study was done in collaboration with Drs. Melinda M.

There is now complete coverage of Canada at the scale of 1:250,000. Of the maps involved, 157 of them contain some depiction of glaciers, and there are possibly another 28 sheets that cover regions where one might expect to find glacier-related features such as glacierets, snow patches, and rock glaciers that may have been overlooked. The mapping of Canada at the 1:50,000 scale still remains to be completed. Unfortunately for the glaciologist, the isolated, unpopulated, ice-covered regions of the country have the lowest priority. The exception is Kluane National Park, St. Elias Mountains, Yukon Territory, which is covered with nonstandard map sheets in black and white with low-quality relief shading that are useful for glaciological applications (see section on Quantitative Measurements of Tweedsmuir Glacier and Lowell Glacier Imagery in the subchapter Glaciers of the St. Elias Mountains, by Garry K.C. Clarke and Gerald Holdsworth, this volume). It is expected that about 1,450 of these sheets might be required to provide complete coverage of all the glacierized areas in the country, but only about half have been published. However, the depiction of glaciological features has improved over the years as the mapping agencies have recognized the need for and availability of knowledge to interpret them. Glacier-inventory maps were used for reference when the 1:50,000-scale maps of Baffin Island were being compiled, leading to a vast improvement in the representation of marginal features such as moraines. Of great benefit has been the opportunity to acquire current maps in digital form so digital terrain models can be much more easily constructed. The move by some mapping agencies towards publication of new maps at scales as large as 1:20,000, also in digital form, may reduce the need for glaciologists to produce special large-scale maps of the glaciers on which they are working. Instead they may be able to concentrate their efforts on determining the changes taking place.ConclusionsOne of the most fruitful collaborations in glacier mapping was between Fritz Müller of the McGill University Axel Heiberg Island Expedition and the PRS-NRCC. This collaboration resulted in the preparation of large-scale topographic maps and stereo-orthophoto maps of several of the island’s glaciers. Another productive relationship was that of Gottfried Konecny, University of New Brunswick, with the Defence Research Board, the Water Survey of Canada, and the National Geographic Society. The role of the Glaciology Division in the production of glacier maps for the IHD, specialty maps of Peyto Glacier and the Columbia Icefield, and orthophoto maps, has also been significant. Unfortunately, none of the above are still involved in any glacier mapping activity, and the Glaciology Division has since been disbanded. Glacier-mapping activity in Canada is limited to a few small projects where the product is unlikely to be published or distributed widely (Cogley, 1999), and this trend will likely continue. Scientists and lay people alike may well regret the loss of this valuable aid. However, financial resources for producing high-quality, multicolored, large-scale maps are no longer readily available. The only possible exception may be Parks Canada (the Canadian Parks Service), which has a large tourist clientele that might make such a venture viable.With the proliferation of personal computers and growth in their storage capacity, the future may see much greater use of digital terrain models and satellite images by individual glaciologists. Optical disks permit the storing, exchange, and analysis of photographic and cartographic information so that the printed thematic map may become a collector’s item.We know that the next generation of satellites will be capable of providing greatly improved spectral and spatial resolution and more current information on glaciers. The technology for analysis of this information using personal computers is developing rapidly.Although the heyday of the printed glacier map may be past in Canada, there are exciting prospects and challenges ahead for glaciologists in digital cartography, GIS, and analysis of remotely sensed data.References CitedAmerican Geographical Society, 1960, Nine glacier maps, northwestern North America: New York, American Geographical Society, AGS Special Publication No. 34, 37 p.Arnold, K.C., 1966, The glaciological maps of Meighen Island, N.W.T: Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, v. 3, no. 6, p. 903–908.———1977, White Glacier; 1:2,500, lowest 2 kilometers (terrestrial photogrammetry), in Fluctuations of glaciers 1970–1975, v.
