The New Revised Standard Version of the Bible is steadily increasing in popularity. It is highly respected among academics, including evangelicals, and popular in theological colleges, where it is preferred to the New International Version.  This edition incorporates extensive annotations and the Deuterocanonical books/Apocrypha, making it an ideal edition for students and serious Bible readers.  The NRSV sensitively avoids gender exclusivity without any loss of accuracy or clarity, and retains the traditional style of referring to God as &#145;He&#146
or &#145;Him.'
