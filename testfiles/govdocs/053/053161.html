<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">President Clinton, in his State of the
Union Address, smugly announced that &quot;We should all be proud
that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor, Mexico, from
its economic crisis. And we should all be proud that...Mexico
repaid the United States--three full years ahead of schedule--with
half a billion dollar profit to us.&quot; The reporting of this
pay-back and the State of the Union Address was all favorable,
highly praising the administration. The bailout was bipartisan
so leaders of both parties were pleased with the announcement.
International finance, just as it is with international military
operations, is rarely hindered by inter-party fights that get
so much attention. But there are several reasons why we should
not be too quick to congratulate the money manipulators.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">FIRST, they merely celebrate the postponement
of the day of reckoning of their financial Ponzi scheme. It took
50 billion in U.S. dollars to save creditors who had unwisely
invested in Mexico prior to the crisis of two years ago. Much
of this $50 billion also included U.S. credit extended through
the IMF, the World Bank, and the Bank of International Settlements,
much of which is yet to be repaid. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">SECOND, foreign government welfare,
and there is no better name for it, takes money out of the productive
sectors of the economy -- the paychecks of middle-class Americans
-- to reward economic mismanagement and political corruption.
Such &quot;welfare&quot; exacerbates Mexico's suffering: social
disruption, economic stagnation, debt crises, and declines in
real incomes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">THIRD, a new fund set up under the IMF
will serve to bail out the next Mexico in trouble. The plan calls
for the establishment of a $25 billion credit fund with the US
&quot;ponying up&quot; $3.5 billion. This fund is in addition
to the IMF funds already available for such crises. Mexico has
also received help from the Inter-American Development Fund; again,
indirectly supported by U.S. taxpayers. These funds indirectly
guarantee the newly-issued Mexican government bonds and undermine
the normal incentive for investors to police governments. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">As such, more confidence is now being
placed in new Mexican bonds enabling Mexico to refinance its old
loans. Of course, it is at slightly lower interest rates, but
they are more than doubling the time of repayment. All investments
involve some risks. The rewards of such risk-taking are appropriately
realized by investors as loans are repaid. American taxpayers
should not, however, be forced to subsidize the Wall Street financier
any time such entrepreneurial ventures are unprofitable. The true
test of the professed confidence in Mexico will come from the
level of private investment into the productive sectors of the
economy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">FOURTH, the Fed is allowed to hold Mexican
bonds and use them as collateral for our own Federal Reserve Notes.
It does so, even though it will not admit it, and refuses to reveal
just how much it holds. It is quite possible that the newly issued
Mexican bonds will find their way into the Fed's holdings. How
far down the road we have traveled from constitutional money when
we are backing the dollar not with gold but with Mexican bonds!
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">FIFTH, a likely motivation for this
fanfare regarding the repayment of the loans, and the so-called
profits engendered, is to get the U.S. Congress to go along with
using this money to pay our back dues to the United Nations. How
about paying our so-called U.N. back dues with our Mexican bond
holdings?!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The use of the Exchange Stabilization
Fund to bail out the peso was illegal and unconstitutional, and
yet now we have a precedent not only established but praised for
its great success. This precedent encourages political currency
manipulation over sound fiscal and monetary policies as well as
establishes the US as lender of last resort for all governments
with bad policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">President Clinton claims that &quot;We
stand at another moment of change and choice--and another time
to be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and
prosperity.&quot; He earlier told us the &quot;era of big government
is over,&quot; but calls for full burden sharing through the IMF
in a multilateral way with the Mexico agreement. We need to end
this shell game of masking economic mismanagement by circumventing
both the Constitution and Congress.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">We must stand firm in our opposition
to the establishment of new extra-governmental agreements that
will reward governments with irresponsible policies which, at
the same time, punish their own people and erode U.S. sovereignty.
Such policies take us one step further from a constitutional rule
of law, and institutionalize the United States as the world's
lender of last resort--all at the expense of the American taxpayer.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Political and economic factors can override,
only in the short run, the subtle reality that the fiat nature
of the dollar guarantees its inherent weakness and steady depreciation.
This new easy credit scheme that the government creates by fiat
only expands the World Dollar Base leading to U.S. dollar depreciation
and reduced buying power.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In essence, the bailout of Mexico and
the financing of the pay-back with interest, to the sheer delight
of the politicians and their Wall Street constituents, were done
on the back of the U.S. dollar and the U.S. taxpayer. The real
consequence, however, will not be felt until dollar confidence
is lost which will surely come and be accompanied by rapid inflation
and high interest rates.<BR>
