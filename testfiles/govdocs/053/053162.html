<h3 align="center"><b><font size="5">Kathleen Kennedy Townsend:<br>
</font><font SIZE="4">Because we cannot afford a four-year detour in the
leadership of our state</h3>
</font></b>
<p><strong>by Congressman Elijah E. Cummings</strong></p>
<p>Recently – referring to our Governor’s race – a Republican House
colleague smugly whispered these words into my ear: &quot;Elijah, it looks like
Maryland may be taking a detour in your state government during the next four
years.&quot;</p>
<p>The Republican was referring to Robert Ehrlich, Jr.’s effort to convince
enough Maryland Democrats either to vote for him – or not to vote at all –
on election day, November 5.</p>
<p>That strategy – if it were to succeed – would allow Congressman
Ehrlich’s conservative, core base of supporters in Maryland’s rural and
suburban areas to make him our Governor for the next four years.</p>
<p>My Republican congressional colleague was absolutely correct in his
assessment that Robert Ehrlich’s election would constitute a dramatic
&quot;detour&quot; in the direction of our state.</p>
<p>What Mr. Ehrlich’s congressional ally did not say, however, was that an
Ehrlich administration would be a four-year detour that Maryland cannot afford.</p>
<p>We cannot allow a detour in our continuing progress toward providing all of
our children with a world-class education, assuring that more of our people can
afford health care, making certain that more of our seniors can afford the
prescription medicines that they need, providing drug treatment to all who need
it, and protecting the natural heritage of our state.</p>
<p>Despite his voting record in the Congress, Mr. Ehrlich has been seeking to
convince Maryland’s progressive voters that he is a &quot;different kind of
Republican.&quot; That – as former President Clinton and I can both confirm
– is definitely not the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t believe that Robert Ehrlich is a different kind of Republican
from the man he has been in the Congress of the United States,&quot; President
Clinton told an overflowing gymnasium at Coppin State College on November 18.</p>
<p>&quot;These are difficult budgetary times for Maryland – as they are for
other state governments throughout the United States,&quot; Bill Clinton
continued. &quot;On crucial issues like education and health care, Maryland
needs a progressive leader you can trust: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.&quot;</p>
<p>Congressman Robert Ehrlich has not adequately explained his failing grades on
civil rights from the national NAACP, his failing grades on education from the
National Education Association, his failing grades from the Children’s Defense
Fund, his failing grades from the AFL-CIO or his failing grades from the
Alliance of Retired Americans.</p>
<p>These are the same national organizations that consistently have given
Maryland Senators Paul Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski, Congressman Ben Cardin and
me A’s for our congressional voting records.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to Robert Ehrlich’s failing grades, Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend joined Maryland House Appropriations Committee Chairman Howard
&quot;Pete&quot; Rawlings and me – along with other elected and community
leaders from throughout the Baltimore region – at New Shiloh Baptist Church on
October 14 where we reaffirmed in written detail our progressive commitment to
the people of our state.</p>
<p>In &quot;A Shared Vision, A Clear Choice,&quot; we pledged to work together
to increase funding for public education, to expand state programs that provide
affordable health insurance, to increase state efforts to help our seniors pay
for their prescription drugs, and to continue our movement toward including all
of Maryland citizens in state employment and contracting opportunities.</p>
<p>Robert Ehrlich has made promises, too – but consider this.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Congressman Ehrlich voted for the President's budget -
a federal funding plan that, during this coming year, would shortchange federal
education aid to Maryland’s students by a quarter of a billion dollars less
than we had promised them in the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; legislation
just last year.</p>
<p>This year, Robert Ehrlich had a perfect opportunity to use his powerful
position in the House Republican leadership to fight for the $250 million in
additional education funding that our children need, were promised and deserve.</p>
<p>However, as far as I have been able to determine, he did not even try to
persuade his Republican colleagues to keep that education promise that we had
made to our children.</p>
<p>Congressman Ehrlich’s failure to synchronize his conscience and his conduct
– or his words and his deeds – is a failing that Maryland’s people cannot
afford to suffer during the next four years.</p>
<p>President Clinton was correct in his advice to us at Coppin State.
Maryland’s people deserve a proven, progressive leader whom we can trust –
Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p>
<p>She has earned my support and the support of the overwhelming majority of
Maryland’s Legislative Black Caucus.</p>
<p>We represent children who deserve a good education, parents who have earned
the right to good jobs that pay a living wage, families who need affordable
health care, and seniors who must no longer be denied the prescription medicines
that will allow them to thrive and survive.</p>
<p>In what has become a very close race, voters from our community will decide
who the next Maryland Governor will be – especially if each of us votes on
November 5 and convinces our friends and family members to join us at the polls
on election day.</p>
<p>Our choice is clear. Maryland cannot afford a four-year detour in the
leadership of our state.</p>
