           SERIOUSLY. HE IS A CHAMPION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
           STATES. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE THE SOURCE OF POWER.
           HE UNDERSTANDS WELL THAT JUDGES ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S
           IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE INTELLIGENT JUDGES AND CAPABLE JUDGES.
           BUT THE JUDGES AS WELL NEED TO RESPECT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE
           A LIMITED FUNCTION OF RESOLVING DISPUTES AND IN SO DOING
           THEY'RE NOT TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OR EXTEND THE LAW BUT TO

           DO RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE NOMINATION OF MARGARET
           MORROW TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT BENCH FOR THE CENTRAL
           DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION. THESE ARE
           NOT PLEASANT TASKS FOR THOSE OF US ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

           NOMINATION, BUT IF WE BELIEVE IN THAT AND WOOR EA CONCERNED
