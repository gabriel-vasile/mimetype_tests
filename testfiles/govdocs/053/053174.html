<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0000CC">One hour and a half pinned between
the stratosphere and a drowsy business professional. Another ninety
minutes consumed in the chaos of one "terminally" confused Salt Lake
City International Airport and its ill-docile tones of boarding
announcements. And yet another hour and a half in suspension over the
skies of Utah and New Mexico. Finally, the swift walk of anticipation
to the security gate of Albuquerque International to meet the "team".
The beings before me had no resemblance to the contorted
monstrosities I viewed of the team prior to my departure (Myself
representing a fine mixture between Richard Simmons and Delta Burke).
Everyone seems bearable with their own idiosyncrasies: Christina is
quiet, Juanama is extroverted, Ned is humorous, Elizabeth is
idealistic, Derek is philosophical, and Frank is humorous yet
seemingly supercilious. But one soul is defined as true evil! This is
none other than the lobster-obsessed, crazed California invalit (a
rough bastardization of the word "invalid"), Hannah. She strikes
shear terror into the hearts of man and woman alike. It is evident
that she and I will be in grueling battle to the death through the
duration of this project (Just kidding!). We ate lunch in some random
tourist trap in the midst of Albuquerque where I presented the idea
of fusing Idaho and Montana into one ideal "Montando" and lamented
with Juanama about the redneck status of our states of Idaho and
Georgia. From there we traveled to Fenton Hill and Los Alamos via the
Jemez Mountains on a road with no God-given right to be within the
craggy peaks, having more curves than the connections of my twisted
brain (courtesy of Hannah Hindley). We soon arrived at the Best
Western Hilltop House where we received our infamous General Employee
Training manuals and Ned and I instantaneously locked our keys in our
room. After a series of faulty room keys, Ned and I finally opened
our room door and returned to the lobby in order to reunite with our
impatient, hungry team members. Dinner set place at the local Pizza
Hut where we consumed grease soaked masses of cheese and tomato sauce
over conversations of the most random nature. We retuned to the hotel
and quickly passed out on our neatly made double beds, ushering the
commencement of thirteen more days of odd human interaction with a
dash of astrophysics.</FONT></P>

previously written, but ruthlessly deleted by the demonically
possessed Macintosh computer upon which I am writing this journal, so
please read with appreciation, and if you are Stephen Jobs or Stephen
Wazniac, you are a sick, heartless shell of man who opened an
unnecessary Pandora's box upon the computer world!)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0000CC">Ned and I arose around eight
o'clock and flowed like molasses out to the lobby. From there we
traveled to the Los Alamos National Laboratory Badge Office where we
were dignified with a rectangular piece of plastic indicating that we
were official temporaries of the United States Department of Energy
and we also derived a new connotation for the word "convert". With
our badges of honor worn smugly around our necks, we took a sojourn
to the Bradbury Science Museum (in no way affiliated with science
fiction author Ray Bradbury) where we uncovered the joyful history of
weapons of mass destruction, used some chicanery on the plutonium
test, and befriended a plaster cast of J. Robert Oppenheimer. We left
the museum for Los Alamos' most happening place to be, Quizno's, but
with over a quarter of the town mewling and growling and whatnot
within the confines of the restaurant in order to sink a bite into
their famous toasted subs, we escaped to a neighboring pool hall
where we attained our sustenance and shot a few horribly, horribly
miserable games of pool. While eating my grease and meat sandwich, I
began to debate with Elizabeth over the functionality of dissolving
Agri-business and placing the nation's breadbasket in the hands of
privately owned farms. Elizabeth took the stance of debunking
Agri-business for moral purposes while I described the economically
detrimental effects of stratifying American agriculture by placing it
in the hands of private farms. We arrived at the Canyon School around
two o'clock for Don's lesson on the infamous CCD Camera. he lesson
was coherent for the first half an hour until my brain collapsed
under its own desire for sleep. During the lesson beak, it was
discovered that one of the team member's friends had died, causing a
malaise to descend upon the room. I became incredibly depressed by
the situation, cornered by the idea that the will to survive in the
Grand Method (my personal term "life") is so strong that we feel so
ashamed when one is unable to achieve this survival. We returned to
the museum for a lecture on cosmology which evoked a sense a wonder
and frustration of the universe's seemingly paradoxical disobedience
to its own scientific laws. It became too much for one man seated
behind me who stormed out of the museum after his question of whether
or not the law of the conservation of mass would be implemented with
the expansion of the universe was answered with a cogent "no". After
a quick tutorial of the twelve inch telescope, Ned and I returned to
the hotel for some intense General Employee Training study action. We
soon figured that common sense would be the most efficient tool for
the G.E.T. test, especially with such study questions as "Which of
the following is not to be done with a government vehicle?" and
"Which of the following does not aid in preventing fires?"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0000CC">Ned and I awoke primed for the
ominous psychometrician's mightmare, the General Employee Training
Exam. The exam was open book and allowed enough time to allow a
blind, paralytic daschund to complete it with flying colors. I
received a perfect score, free from further General Employee Training
objectives and admitted into the prestigious one hundred percent club
along with Ned (the only other member), truly a moment of pure utter
glory! We left the testing center quite earlier than expected,
granting us some liesure time at the hotel until lunch. A local sub
shop osed the setting of our sandwich gluttony. Frank "accidently"
took my sandwich, but I was swiftly reimbersed. I also found
frustration in convincing my father over the phone that I was not in
Nevada. Running ahead of schedule, we stopped at "Central Park" for a
quick frisbee throw. The celestial coordinates discussion with John
was an ethereal blur due to my conversation with Hannah via my TI-83
Plus (see Hannah's journal for conversation). Dinner was set at one
of a myriad of Mexican themed restaurants in Los Alamos where
Elizabeth and I convulsed into the most heated debate so far...the
meaning of life. Elizabeth expressed her vwiws of some divine or
spiritul purpose present in life while I defined my
non-interventionist deist philosophy. After forty-five minutes
driving through the Jemez Mountains, we arrived at Fenton Hill for
our first observing session. It took a while to perfect my star
centering skills, but due to the stunning allure of the New Mexican
sky with its thousands of points of light intermingling to form a
universe so intriguing and yet so distant.</FONT></P>
