</span></span><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>INTRODUCTION</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Good
morning.  It’s a pleasure to be with you to kick off  MSTV’s annual conference
on digital television.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As
we sit today to discuss digital television, the Federal Communications
Commission presides over a communications industry in transition.  Nearly every
sector within the communications industry is confronting dramatic industry-changing
trends—migrations if you will.  And, it is doing so at a time of great economic
upheaval.  These are tough days to be in the communications game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
challenges are numerous and multi-dimensional:  tough capital markets; 
changing market structure;  new forms of competition;  fractured consumer
interests; and above all, technological disruption.  This technical dimension is,
to my mind, the most central change from which so many of the others stem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Every
communications sector is embarked on an unavoidable journey—migrating to
digital architecture in order to provide the services of the future.  These
services will be marked by greater personalization of content; diminishing
significance of time and place for communicating, informing and entertaining
the consumer; and less centralized control of services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>No
communications industry is exempt.  Traditional telephone providers must
migrate from copper cages to digital architecture in order to lower costs to
address greater competition and to provide new broadband data services that consumers
will demand.  Cable is deploying fiber architecture that will allow it to meet
the capacity challenges faced by satellite and to offer more of the digital and
interactive services, as well as internet and data services, that consumers are
beginning to want and expect.  Wireless companies have made the switch to
digital systems, but are just now starting to focus on the kinds of new and
novel services that can run over those platforms.  Radio is just starting to
introduce new products as they set foot on the digital shore. Internet radio,
satellite radio and the new IBOC standard are beginning to arrive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>And
then there is free over the air television.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Every
communications sector has a leasehold on the digital land of plenty.  Their
slice of the digital future is dependant on how well that real estate is developed
and utilized.  Your little corner of digital earth is Digital Television and
HDTV.  It is your clear chance at a robust future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Do Not Be Fooled by the Current
Upheaval</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
dot.com craze of the late 1990s popped so loud it could be heard around the world. 
It was followed by an even more spectacular decline in the telecommunications
markets as the fortune tellers’ predictions of infinite bandwidth, back-of-the-napkin
business models and never-can-loose investing all proved a dream.  While
fortunes were lost, many—some of you, no doubt—could not hide your giddiness. 
We were a bit tired of 26 year old millionaire phenoms, clad in khaki, denim
and soft-soled shoes, preaching the digital future like a messiah come to show us
the errors of our misguided ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some
of you breathed a big sigh of relief.  “Ah ha,!” you were heard to exclaim, “these
“digital.coneheads” were not invincible after all.”  “They have been put back
in their place,” you cheer as you fetch your old ties out of the closet and
ship them off to the cleaners.  Nothing like the tried and true old business
you grew up with.  “Digital fad, who needs it.” Smugly, you think about putting
on the three-piece suit, trading in the pea green VW bug for an Olds 98, and
hey, maybe even throwing out the computer altogether and using the old slide
rule just for kicks.  “Happy Days are Here Again.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Think
again.  Please, for the sake of everyone around you, leave the Aqua Velva and
the brown leisure suit in the past. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It
would be a grave error to see the present set back in digital life as either a
validation of the old ways, or a rejection of digital change.  Current economic
conditions, discredited internet business plans and other signs mistakenly
might give that impression.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What
we are witnessing, instead, is merely the classic pattern of volatile
technological change.   Rather than becoming complacent about the imperative of
change, we must prepare for the inevitable rebound that will take us further
into the future.  We have not been given a reprieve from change, for history
tells another story.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Brian
Arthur has identified five technology revolutions over the past few centuries,
beginning with the Industrial Revolution and ending with the current Digital
Revolution.  He found that each followed a specific pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>At first a new and
little-noticed technology “cluster” is introduced, and technical people start
small companies based on the new ideas.  These small companies compete
intensely in a turbulent “start-up” phase.  As successes build, the lure of
extraordinary profits leads to over-speculation and eventually a crash.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>But the interesting thing is
that after the crash, the technology enters into a period of sustained
build-out or a “golden age,” during which it becomes the engine for growth for
the economy.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>In the final phase, the
technology is mature.  It has saturated its possibilities and complacency sets
in.  The economy becomes ripe for the next revolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consider
the railroad revolution Arthur describes in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Britain</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> beginning in about 1825.  By the 1840s, improvements
in rail technology brought about a full-scale railroad mania.  Queen </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Victoria</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> made
her first rail trip in 1842 and declared she was “quite charmed by it.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Suddenly,
railways became fashionable.  Entrepreneurs rushed in.  Railway valuations
soared.  Fortunes were made.  New railway lines were built to connect little-known
towns to other little-known towns.  People poured their savings into railway
stock.  And why not?  It looked like a sure thing.  That is, until reality set
in and railway shares began plummeting.  By 1847, railway companies had lost
85% of their value and several hundred had folded.  Sound familiar?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But
again, the important observation Arthur makes is that it wasn’t the end of the
railway revolution.  Most of the growth in railroads occurred <i>after</i> the
initial bubble had burst.  In 1845, before the crash, there were 2,148 miles of
railway in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Britain</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>.  By 1910, there were <i>21,000 miles</i>.  The great
majority of the railway build-out occurred <i>after</i> the speculative mania
had passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.25in'>If Arthur is right, the digital
revolution is struggling through the aftermath of the initial speculative
crash, but its best days -- its golden age -- are yet to come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><br>
III.       <u>THE DTV MIGRATION IS REGAINING STEAM</u></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In
the five years that I have been on the Commission, I have heard a great deal of
grumbling about the DTV transition:  “It is a great government give-away;” 
“Consumers do not want it;”  “It is an unnecessary industrial policy;”  and “It’s
too expensive with little return.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> 
The cold truth, however, is that we have no choice—not just because Congress
has mandated it (which is reason enough) but  because the trends in technology
and the forces of change will ultimately demand it of any provider that hopes
to be relevant in the digital future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
Commission itself has embraced the change.  We recognized last April that the
transition had to be driven forward—to satisfy the wishes of Congress, to meet
the expectations of consumers, and, most importantly, to advance free television’s
future—perhaps even to ensure its survival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consequently,
we took up an aggressive leadership role to assist in bringing the transition
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We
began working with Congressman Tauzin and other key members of Congress to
re-energize the dialog around solutions that would move things faster. 
Subsequently, we crafted a voluntary plan to speed the transition and I am
proud to say that industry has responded.  We called on the top four networks
and HBO and Showtime to provide consumers with high-definition or value added
DTV programming during prime time.  We called on broadcast licensees to pass
through and promote network DTV programming.  We asked cable operators and DBS
operators to carry more digital programming services and to market those
services, and to allow consumers to access that content.  And we called on the
equipment manufacturers and retailers to produce the devices that will allow consumers
to view digital programming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We
have not stopped there.  We have used our offices to keep pressure on all
segments of the industry to find solutions to clearing DTV roadblocks.  We are
actively and aggressively engaged in matters involving equipment compatibility,
copyright protections, and carriage obligations, just to name a few.  Moreover,
we have used our power to mandate change when an industry could not - or would
not- come to a solution.  We will not fail to act to keep things moving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Comparing
today with where we were one short year ago, we see great strides made toward
getting to the digital side of television’s migration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>High definition content on the
broadcast networks is up about 50% during prime-time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There’s more HD content on cable
and satellite, such as Discovery’s 24-hour HD channel.  Premier sporting events
like the Olympics and the NCAA Final Four are broadcast in HD.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>More HD sports are on the way.
ESPN HD will launch next April.  Monday Night Football will be in HD next year,
as will the Super Bowl, the NBA Finals and the NHL Stanley Cup.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Hundreds more stations are on the
air in digital. Last year at this time, we had about 200 stations on the air.
Now we have over 550.  In the top 30 markets, which cover 54% of TV households,
113 of 119 top-four network affiliates are on the air with DTV.  According to some
figures, DTV signals are now transmitted in markets covering 91.9% of
households.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Cable is coming on board. The ten
largest cable operators (representing more than 85% of subscribers nationwide)
have agreed to carry HD programming and deploy HD-capable set-top boxes in the
near future. <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We now have a DTV tuner mandate in
place, so that consumers can be assured that their television sets will go on
working in the digital world just as they do today.  And we adopted a phased-in
requirement starting with the largest sets, so the price impact on consumers
would be minimized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Even
where challenges remain, we have made much progress this year. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>On “plug and play” cable
compatibility, the basic technical standards are now largely complete.  The
cable and CE industries are working to resolve the remaining business issues,
and they’re making significant progress.  Panasonic’s announcement last week
that it signed the PHILA agreement is an extremely encouraging sign.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>On the “broadcast flag” copy
protection, the various industries have worked to narrow their differences over
the past year.  Last August we initiated a proceeding to determine whether and
how the Commission should issue rules in this area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>So
to paraphrase President Reagan, “Is the DTV transition better off today than it
was a year ago?”  The answer is a resounding “yes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But
it will take some time before the impact of DTV is fully felt.  Look at DVDs --
a tremendous success story, now in 31 million homes and rising fast.  Yet
studios are still learning how to develop digital content for the DVD market. 
For instance, the studios are beginning to plan the DVD “extra features” up
front, as an integral part of the process, rather than simply as an
afterthought once the movie is finished.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Eventually,
digital will change television in fundamental ways.  It will change the way
stories are written and told.  It’s a learning process, a re-wiring of our
analog brains.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Digital
is simply a different species than analog.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Digital
is also changing the distribution business – not that I have to tell you.  You
are all -- I hope -- operating two transmitters -- one analog and one digital
-- and experiencing the differences first-hand.  One of the major differences
is the digital “cliff effect.”  Unlike analog, with digital you either get a
perfect picture or you get a blank screen.  There is no gradual degradation. 
That’s a challenge for you and it’s a challenge for equipment manufacturers to
ensure that consumers do not lose service as the transition proceeds.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Cable
and satellite distribute their products digitally as well.  Satellite has
always been all-digital, and cable has been engaged in a massive digital
upgrade effort.  Up to now, cable has used digital technology primarily to
deliver more channels to subscribers.  But now, as I mentioned earlier, the ten
largest cable operators are beginning to use digital technology to provide high
definition services as well.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>And
again, broadband platforms, from cable modem to DSL to fixed wireless to
satellite, are proliferating—allowing ever-expanding, diverse digital
programming to reach consumers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Manufacturers,
of course, must completely retool for digital.  It’s both a major challenge and
a huge opportunity for the CE industry.  Given the highly competitive nature of
the industry, I have every confidence that they will be successful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
final link in the chain is the retailers.  Retailers must train their staffs
and redesign their space to sell digital.  And they must find a way to get HD
content onto the sets on the display floor.  If a consumer is shopping for a
high definition set, they should be able to see high definition content.  DVDs
are good, but they’re not HD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consumers,
too, are beginning to embrace the digital television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I
have no doubt that we have a major consumer education effort in front of us. 
But I also think that when the pieces of a transition come together – as they
are now doing – that can happen quickly.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>We’re not there yet, but the pieces of the puzzle
are starting to come together.  When that happens, we’ll finally have the
content, the distribution and the equipment necessary to shift the transition
into high gear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>We are where we are. There is no turning back and
no retreat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>At the FCC, we will lead guided by pragmatism, but
backed up by regulatory action that we will not hesitate to employ where
necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>How you handle this transition and how creatively
you embrace the challenge will determine whether free TV prospers, or indeed whether
it survives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>It’s time to redouble our efforts.  This transition
is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>To end where this conference begins, “Digital
Television:  The Time Is Now.”</p>
