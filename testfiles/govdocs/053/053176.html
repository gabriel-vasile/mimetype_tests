      <h3>Poets Susan Ludvigson and Michael McFee To Read at Library of Congress October 14
</h3>

<P>   

On Thursday evening, October 14, the Library of Congress's
Gertrude Clarke Whittall Poetry and Literature Fund will present
a reading by poets Susan Ludvigson and Michael McFee.  The
reading will be at 6:45 p.m. in the Montpelier Room, Madison
Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E., and will be followed by a
reception.  Poet Laureate Rita Dove will introduce the poets. 
Tickets are not required.</P>

<P>Susan Ludvigson is professor of English and poet-in-residence at
Winthrop University.  She is the recipient of fellowships and
grants from the Guggenheim, Rockefeller, Witter Bynner, and
Fulbright foundations, as well as from the National Endowment for
the Arts and the North and South Carolina arts commissions.  She
was poetry editor for Intro 13, the anthology of the Associated
Writing Programs, and served as a judge for recent Intro awards.</P>

<P>Last year, Ms. Ludvigson served on three National Endowment for
the Arts peer review panels, including the poetry fellowships
panel.  Her seven books include The Beautiful Noon of No Shadow,
To Find the Gold, and Everything Winged Must Be Dreaming.  She
represented the United States at the First International Women
Writers' Congress in Paris, a conference of French, Soviet and
American writers, as well as at writers meetings in Canada,
Yugoslavia, and Belgium.  This fall she will participate in a
congress of poets in Cyprus.</P>

<P>Of Ms. Ludvigson's most recent collection of poems, Everything
Winged Must Be Dreaming, Jonathan Holden wrote:  "Nobody in our
poetry celebrates existence more authentically than Ludvigson, or
gives us better advice about how to live.  And this is her
strongest book yet." </P> 

<P>Deborah Pope, in Southern Poetry Review, said of To Find the
Gold: "The voice is rich in sensual and spiritual knowledge, able
to passionately celebrate without guile, meditate without
affectation, ache without self-pity.  `To Enter,' the stunning
closing poem of the book, exemplifies the twinned beauty and
fierceness driving Ludvigson's vision of love and art."</P>  

<P>Michael McFee is the author of four collections of poetry:  Plain
Air; Vanishing Acts; To See, in which his poems are paired with
photographs by Elizabeth Matheson; and Sad Girl Sitting on a
Running Board.  He received his A.B. degree (graduating summa cum
laude in creative writing) and his M.A. degree from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  He is currently
lecturer in creative writing at the University of North Carolina
and has served on the faculties of Cornell, Lawrence, North
Carolina State, and Duke universities.  Mr. McFee's many awards
and honors include the 1991-92 Durham Arts Council Seasonal
Grant, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, the 1986
Ingram Merrill Foundation Fellowship, the 1981-82 Pushcart Prize,
and a Discovery/The Nation Award (1980).  He is the author of
many reviews and critical essays in publications such as USA
Today, Newsday, and Pembroke Magazine.</P>

<P>Of Mr. McFee's collection Plain Air, William Harmon wrote: "For
upwards of four centuries, poor old modest North Carolina dragged
along, never batting higher than about .125 in the Literary
League, and even that meager team average was the work of solo
slugger Thomas Wolfe... And now, having evidently gotten the
knack, North Carolina gives us Michael McFee, and the state can
brag smugly and gloatingly."
