        <h1>Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales</h1>
        <H3>Introduction</H3><p><SPAN CLASS="content">The Little Mermaid, the Ugly Duckling, 
and the Emperor who paraded naked through his city are characters well known to 
most of our students. In these lessons, your students will learn about the 19th 
century author who created these characters and will hear and read the original 
texts of several of his stories. The colorful characters, strong emotions, and 
engaging language of Andersen's tales offer rich imaginative experiences for students, 
as well as opportunities to analyze themes and ideas. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">These 
learning activities could be used for students in K-2, with the omission of The 
Little Match Girl, which might be upsetting for younger students. </span></p><h3>Guiding 
Questions:</h3><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Who was Hans Christian Andersen? What 
are some of his most well known stories? What are some typical characteristics 
and themes of Andersen's stories? How do we feel about Andersen's stories? </span></p><H3>Learning 
Objectives</H3><p><SPAN CLASS="content">After completing this lesson, students 
will be able to: <ul><li>know Andersen's nationality, language, and time period 
</li><li>summarize the plots of two of Andersen's stories </li><li>identify the 
main characters of four of Andersen's stories </li><li>explain the theme of at 
least one of Andersen's stories </li><li>express their reactions to a story by 
Hans Christian Andersen</li></ul></SPAN> <H3><A NAME="PREPARING"></A>Preparing

on Hans Christian Andersen:</h4></SPAN><P><span class="content">Like many of his 
beloved fictional characters, Hans Christian Andersen came from humble origins. 
Born in a one-room house to a shoemaker and a washerwoman, Andersen lost his father 
when he was 11 and left home at age 14 determined to become famous. Teased by 
school mates for his awkward appearance and bullied by a teacher who told told 
him his writings were fit only for the trash can, Andersen persevered with almost 
desperate devotion to his art and ultimately became known throughout the world 
as a genius of the literary fairy tale genre. </SPAN></P><P><span class="content">Andersen's 
stories are steeped in melancholy and longing, often featuring humble characters 
who long for love and acceptance into a higher realm of society or more glorious 
existence. A mermaid pines for a human prince; an ugly toad travels from the bottom 
of a well to seek something "higher"; a starving child imagines ever more beautiful 
tableaux of prosperity as she freezes to death. Many of Andersen's stories feature 
personified objects such as darning needles or candles that have thoughts, intentions, 
and feelings. </SPAN></P><P><span class="content">The Fir Tree, (in the story 
of that name) for example, looks forward to being decorated as part of the Christmas 
celebration and feels sad when her trimmings are stripped away. Andersen has a 
keen eye for social pretensions and vanity, and many of his stories satirize these 
human failings. A pea, for example, smugly considers itself the "most remarkable" 
of its pod because it is about to burst after festering in gutter water in <I>Five 
Peas from the Same Pod</I>. The emperor of <I>The Emperor's New Clothes</I> is 
so fearful of being thought stupid that he allows himself to be fooled into ludicrous 
behavior by a pair of charlatans. Thus, Andersen infused the stock figures of 
traditional fairy tale with human weaknesses and strong personal emotions. </SPAN></P><P><span class="content">Andersen's 
story endings are frequently unhappy. A starving child dies alone in a freezing 
ally; a toy soldier is reduced to a lump of melted metal; a little fir tree is 
thrown in a fire. Rather than redeem his characters' sufferings by an ultimate 
acquisition of love and riches, Andersen shows how goodness and integrity can 
ennoble the last moments of a lonely and poverty-stricken life. The starving child 
does not truly die alone, nor does the toy soldier's love remain eternally a secret, 
for we, the readers, know the stories and feel pity for the child's privations 
and sympathy for the soldier's love. The traditional fairy tale shows how bad 
luck can change into dazzling successes. Andersen, in contrast, portrays the luminous 
spiritual dignity of even the most relentless ill fortune. </SPAN></P><P><span class="content">Andersen 
was born in 1805 in Denmark. His stories have been translated into more than 80 
languages and are known throughout the world. The well-known aphorisms "ugly duckling" 
and "emperor's new clothes" come from his stories of the same titles. <I>The Little 
Mermaid</I> has been made into one of Walt Disney's most popular movies. Andersen's 
stories, either singly or in collections, have been published in thousands of 
editions, many with lavish illustrations.</SPAN> </P><h4>Sources for Biographical

Summation and Review</a></p><P> <span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON1">1. 
<I>The Ugly Duckling</I> </a></span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Read aloud <I>The 
Ugly Duckling</I>. Tell students this story was written by Hans Christian Andersen. 
Show a picture of the author, either from a biography or printed out from the 
website <A HREF="http://www.kb.dk/web_udstillinger/hca-portr/">Hans Christian Andersen 
Portraits</a>, or display on a computer monitor. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Read aloud the chapter on Andersen 
in Kathleen Krull's <I>Lives of the Writers Comedies, Tragedies and What the Neighbors 
Thought</I>. As a class, locate Denmark on a globe. Tell the students that people 
in Denmark speak Danish. If possible, play a recording of someone speaking Danish. 
You can find short phrases in Danish at the web site <A HREF="http://www.nypl.org/branch/central/dlc/df/useful.html">Useful 
Expressions and Greetings in 26 Languages</a>, available from the web site <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/div/kidspace/">KidSpace</a>, 
which is available from the EDSITEment-reviewed resource <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet 
Public Library</a>. Ask if any students in the room know a language other than 
English. Have them say a sentence or a phrase in their second language and ask 
them to tell the class what it means. Explain to the students that when you know 
two languages, you can translate from one to the other. Andersen's stories have 
been translated from Danish to English. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">As 
a class, have students recall and dictate the most interesting facts about his 
life that they can recall from Krull's brief biographical sketch. Write each fact 
on a colorful piece of tagboard. On another day, mix up the cards and have students 
put them in order to create a timeline. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Ask 
students to reflect on how the story <I>The Ugly Duckling</I> might be similar 
or dissimilar to Andersen's own life. Use a Venn diagram to note the students' 
observations, with similarities noted in the overlapping portions of the two circles 
and differences noted on opposite non-overlapping sections of the circles. After 
the class discussion, you may wish to take down the large Venn diagram and pass 
out individual copies of the <A HREF="/lesson_images/lesson417/Blank_Venn.pdf">blank 
Venn diagram</a>, provided as a downloadable file in PDF format. Allow students 
to work in pairs to see how many facts they can recall and write in the correct 
places on their diagrams. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Make Joann Burch's 
<I>A Fairy-Tale Life: A Story About Hans Christian Andersen</I> available for 
students who would like to read more on their own about Andersen, perhaps giving 
them time later on to share what they have learned with the rest of the class. 
Students may use the T-chart on <A HREF="/lesson_images/lesson417/Andersen_Facts.pdf">Facts 
About Hans Christian Andersen's Life</a>, provided in PDF format, to note down 
familiar facts on one side and new information on the other side of the chart. 
</span></p><P><span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON2">2. <I>The Little Mermaid</I></a></span></p><p><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Read 
aloud, or have the class read, <I>The Little Mermaid</I>. Ask students to recall the main characters and 
some of their important actions. Many of the students will have seen the Walt 
Disney movie, <I>The Little Mermaid</I> (1989). Ask them to describe some of the 
key differences between the movie version and the original text. </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Print 
out the key sections of the story, for example: </span></P><SPAN CLASS="content"><ul><li>The 
birthdays of the mermaid sisters</li><li>The shipwreck and the Little Mermaid's 
saving of the prince</li><li>The Little Mermaid's transaction with the Sea witch</li><li>The 
Little Mermaid's life in the palace</li><li>The Prince's engagement</li><li>The 
Little Mermaid's conversation with her sisters and refusal to kill the Prince</li><li>The 
Little Mermaid's transformation into a Daughter of the Air</li></ul></span><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Divide 
class into small groups and have each group create a skit based on their section 
of the story. Encourage students to elaborate a bit on their section. For example, 
the students acting out the Little Mermaid's transformation to a Daughter of the 
Air might want to show students doing good deeds and making the Daughters of the 
Air happy. Have each group present their skit to the whole class. </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Discuss 
the ending of the story with the students, in which the Little Mermaid sacrifices 
her own life in order to let the Prince go on living. Ask the students to guess 
why Andersen might have created this ending rather than the happier ending that 
the movie has. What was Andersen trying to teach or show with this ending? Ask 
students to suggest other possible endings, for example, what might have happened 
if the Prince had sacrificed his life for the Little Mermaid? </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Distribute 
storyboards to students with spaces for each main section of the story, and ask 
them to work in pairs to sketch a picture and write 2-3 sentences summarizing 
what happens in each section of the story. For grades 4 and 5, have students write a book review based on their summaries and their reactions to the story.</span> </P><P><span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON3">3. 
<I>The Emperor's New Clothes</I></a></span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Read aloud, or have the students read, <I>The Emperor's New Clothes</I>. Divide the class into groups and distribute 
sections of the story for them to act out, as they did with <I>The Little Mermaid</I>. 
Be sure to mix up students so that groups are composed of different students. 
</span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Have the students write mock advertisements 
for "invisible clothing" noting the advantages of having this type of clothing. 
Students may take turns reading their advertisements out loud in a dramatic voice, 
perhaps using a small microphone to simulate the effect of a television announcer. 
</span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">As a group, discuss the story's theme with 
the students. What events and characters in the story express Andersen's theme? 
How does Andersen make his point that vanity is foolish? </span></p><P><span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON4">4. 
<I>The Little Match Girl</I></a></span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Read aloud 
<I>The Little Match Girl</I>. Ask students whether they liked the ending or not. 
Then ask them why they think Andersen might have made such a sad ending. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Working 
as a group, have students summarize the story. Write the summary on a large piece 
of tagboard. Then, ask students to brainstorm various other possible endings to 
the story. Have students write out their own favorite endings to Andersen's story 
and create illustrations for them. </span></p><P><span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON5">5. 
<I>The Darning Needle</I></a></span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Read aloud <I>The 
Darning Needle</I>. Discuss with the students the concept of "point of view." 
From whose point of view is this story told? (The darning needle's.) Have students 
find text evidence that supports the needle's point of view. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Ask 
students to describe the needle's character, based on these texts. In other words, 
what kind of "person" is the needle? Humble or vain? Serious or cheerful? Timid 
or adventurous? Lazy or industrious? </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Ask the 
students to hypothesize about what point or theme Andersen is trying to express 
through the character of the darning needle. Does this story have anything in 
common with any of the other stories by Andersen that they have studied? Help 
students to discover that both <I>The Darning Needle</I> and <I>the Emperor's 
New Clothes</I> poke fun at vanity. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">How might 
this story change if it were told from a different point of view? As a class or 
in small groups, have students brainstorm short anecdotes or stories told from 
the point of view of various inanimate objects, such as a pencil, a bicycle, or 
a hat. Students in grades 4 and 5 can write a narrative from the object's point of view.</span></p><P><span class="contentbold"><a name="LESSON6">6. Summation 
and Review</a></span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Have students choose a favorite 
character from one of the four stories they have studied and make a detailed and 
colorful illustration of it/him/her. Have students write four hints about the 
character's identity on the back of the illustration. Let the students take turns 
reading aloud their hints to the class and then showing their illustration when 
their classmates have guessed. Have each student explain briefly why this is his 
or her favorite character. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Ask students to 
recall the themes of some of the stories. Challenge them to recall at least three 
details and/or events from the stories that support each theme. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Have 
an "Andersen" party. Students may dress up as their favorite character. Serve 
Danish foods. View a videotape or film version of an Andersen story. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">If 
possible, provide multiple copies of Andersen's fairy tales for students to read 
and discuss in literature circles or small groups. Have a classroom display of 
stories by Andersen for students to read during independent reading times. </span></p><h3><A NAME="SELECTED"></A>Selected
