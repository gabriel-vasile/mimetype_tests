var WPFootnote3 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Minotti and Bucci also engaged in several unrelated drug\
transactions.  The district court, however, excluded evidence\
regarding these deals as unduly prejudicial.  Thus, we will not\
consider them in our review.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote4 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Ruiz pleaded guilty to a separate indictment.  He received\
substantial sentence reductions in exchange for his testimony\
against Bucci and Jordan.  Additionally, he received safety valve\
treatment for which he almost certainly would not have been\
eligible had the government disclosed information, adduced in this\
case, to the sentencing court concerning numerous threats Ruiz made\
against Minotti.  The jury, of course, was entitled to credit\
Ruiz\'s testimony, which was mostly corroborated by reliable\
evidence, despite these inducements.</p>\

deny Bucci\'s motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 102) and\
his motion to correct the trial transcript (Docket No. 152).  These\
matters are better addressed by the district court on a petition\
for collateral review.  We grant Bucci\'s second motion to\
supplement the record (Docket No. 128), given that the document in\
question has already been made a part of the record by the district\
court.  It is not, however, pertinent to any issue pending before\
us.  Finally, we deny Bucci\'s motion to file a supplemental reply\
brief (Docket No. 155).  We require no further elaboration of his\
claims of error.</p>\

that Bucci\'s own theory of the case rested on the premise that he\
was a drug addict rather than a drug dealer.</p>\

var WPFootnote10 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Jordan argues that the district court erred by determining\
that he was subject to a mandatory minimum on the weapons charge\

contends that brandishing a firearm is an element of the offense\

a jury in light of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span>.  He acknowledges, however, that this\

Muolo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and possession charges of

2003, Jordan renewed an old acquaintance with an individual named
Jon Minotti, a former corrections officer who worked in real estate
and as a plasterer.  At some time during their renewed
relationship, Jordan began to purchase marijuana from Minotti, who
dealt drugs to support his own habit.  Jordan expressed anger to
Minotti regarding the amount of money that cocaine dealers earned
through their illicit trade.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"> Bucci informed Minotti that
he wanted to rob Ruiz, with whom he was angry.  Bucci devised a
plan in which Jordan would arrive to "bust" a drug deal between
Minotti and Ruiz, allowing Minotti to escape with the drugs. 
Muolo, another friend of Minotti, was recruited as Minotti's
getaway driver.  Minotti relayed the proposal to Jordan, who
initially expressed some reluctance at participating.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Undeterred by Jordan's lack of enthusiasm for the scheme,
Bucci proceeded with alacrity.  A few days before Christmas, Bucci
directed Minotti to order three kilograms of cocaine from Ruiz on
his behalf.  On December 23, after some negotiations, Minotti and
Ruiz settled on a price of either $27,000.00 or $28,000.00 per
kilogram and agreed to meet at Minotti's house at 10:00 a.m. the
next day to complete the transaction.  With time running short,
Minotti again solicited Jordan's help.  Jordan, although still
ambivalent, proposed that everyone involved in the prospective
robbery meet in the parking lot of the Malden Medical Center the
next day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Around 8:30 a.m. on December 24, Bucci, in his black S500
Mercedes Benz, license plate number 3802YL, drove to Minotti's
house.  Muolo apparently arrived separately.  From there, Bucci,
Minotti, and Muolo drove in Minotti's vehicle, a black Chevrolet
Avalanche, to the Medical Center.  There, they met Jordan, who was
driving an unmarked police car, a tan Honda.  Despite some
lingering reservations, he agreed to participate in the scheme in
exchange for $30,000.00.  Jordan suggested that Minotti "escape"
with the stolen drugs through a strip of woods adjacent to the
Medical Center.  From there, Minotti could reach a nearby street,
where Muolo would pick him up.  Bucci proposed that Jordan call for
back-up to make the bust appear more realistic, but Jordan
demurred.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Unbeknownst to the conspirators, the DEA had tapped
Ruiz's phone as part of an ongoing, mostly unrelated narcotics
investigation.  Around December 20, 2003, the DEA intercepted
communications between Ruiz and Minotti regarding the proposed
transaction.  In response, the DEA set up roving surveillance
outside Minotti's residence, commencing at approximately 9:00 a.m.
on December 24.  At 9:10 a.m., DEA Agent Jean Drouin and
Massachusetts State Police Sergeant Thomas Quin observed a black
Mercedes parked in the driveway with license plate number 3802YL,
but noted that Minotti's black Chevrolet Avalanche was absent. 
When the agents returned at 9:42 a.m., the Mercedes was gone, but
Minotti's Avalanche had returned.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At 9:55 a.m., Ruiz arrived in a maroon Buick Park Avenue. 
Ruiz and Minotti left the house together in Ruiz's car to travel to
the Medical Center.  After a few seconds, however, Minotti
instructed Ruiz to turn around, under the pretense that he had
forgotten his cell phone.  In reality, Minotti was experiencing
doubts about the wisdom of robbing Ruiz.  Leaving Ruiz in the car,
Minotti called Bucci to express these concerns.  Minotti told Bucci
that the deal would not work anyway, falsely explaining that Ruiz
wanted to be paid before relinquishing physical possession of the
cocaine.  Bucci instructed Minotti to hand over the phone to Ruiz. 
After a conversation between the two, which Minotti overheard, Ruiz
agreed to bring all of the cocaine to the parking lot of the
Medical Center, to permit Bucci an opportunity to test its quality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When Minotti and Ruiz arrived at the Medical Center they
pulled alongside Bucci's vehicle, which was positioned against a
rail, facing outward to the parking lot.  Minotti exited the car,
taking with him all three kilograms of cocaine. After observing
Jordan's car entering the parking lot, perhaps twenty or third
yards distant, Minotti immediately fled down an embankment into the
woods carrying the three kilograms with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Jordan positioned his car directly behind Ruiz's Buick,
blocking Ruiz (but not Bucci) from escape.  Jordan, in plain
clothes, exited the car, shouted "Malden Police," and pointed a gun
at Ruiz.  Jordan ordered both Ruiz and Bucci from their vehicles
and frisked both men.  Jordan searched Ruiz's car, examined his
license, and performed a warrant check.  He did not, however,
perform any similar investigation of Bucci.  Jordan then informed
Ruiz, "It's your lucky day.  I'm going to let you go.  You have a
merry Christmas."  Ruiz returned to his car and left the parking
lot.  Jordan departed the parking lot as well, driving directly
past Agent Drouin and Sergeant Quin's surveillance location.  Bucci
left his car and entered the Medical Center.  A few minutes later,
Jordan returned to the parking lot and drove to the entrance of the
Medical Center.  Bucci exited the Medical Center, and the two men
had a brief conversation before going their separate ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Muolo and Minotti took the cocaine to Muolo's apartment
in Stoneham.  Once Bucci arrived, the conspirators opened one of
the bags of cocaine.  Taking the cocaine, Bucci indicated that he
planned to sell it and split the proceeds with the others.  Because
Jordan was impatient to receive his share of the money, Bucci,
Minotti, and Muolo decided to give him whatever cash was available
by the end of the night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Later that afternoon, Ruiz and his brother-in-law,
Armando Lovos, arrived at Minotti's house in a blue SUV.  Ruiz
suspected that the drug bust had been a setup, did not believe that
Jordan was a real police officer, and was unsurprisingly furious
with Minotti.  Ruiz demanded that the cocaine be returned
immediately.  Minotti replied that he had abandoned the drugs in
the woods and refused to return to search for them, ostensibly for
fear that the police would be there.  Still unsatisfied, Ruiz
nevertheless left to search for the cocaine in the woods near the
Medical Center.  After Ruiz's departure, Minotti called Bucci to
inform him of Ruiz's visit.  Bucci suggested to Minotti that Jordan
should confront Ruiz at the Medical Center to demonstrate his
legitimacy.  Minotti communicated this suggestion to Jordan, who
agreed to look for Ruiz at the Medical Center. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At the Medical Center, Jordan encountered Ruiz and Lovos. 
Jordan took Lovos's identification, but did not run a warrant
check.  Instead, he simply instructed Ruiz and Lovos to leave the
area.  Recordings from the DEA's wire on Ruiz substantiate that
Ruiz was convinced he had been ripped off and that he knew Jordan
was not an honest policeman.  In fact, Jordan's appearance only
reinforced Ruiz's suspicions, as he rightly inferred that one of
the conspirators had tipped Jordan off that Ruiz and Lovos were
returning to the Medical Center to search for the supposedly
abandoned cocaine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At about 10:15 p.m., Minotti received a voicemail from
Bucci indicating that he had left money in a "blue tub" outside
Minotti's back door.  After finding the money, Minotti took
$5,000.00 for himself to satisfy an unrelated debt and delivered
the remainder to Jordan at his home.  Jordan later complained that
the black bag contained only $15,000.00 and demanded the rest of
his payment.  Bucci, again via Minotti, promised Jordan that he
would receive the rest of his payment once Bucci was able to sell
the cocaine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>On December 26, Jordan stopped by Minotti's house to make
sure Minotti was unharmed, that Ruiz had not returned, and to
ascertain when he would receive the rest of his money.  Jordan
instructed Minotti that, if questioned, he should tell law
enforcement officers that he had been acting as an informant for
Jordan in an attempt to catch Ruiz dealing drugs.  Just then, Ruiz
appeared at Minotti's home, accompanied by four or five henchmen. 
Jordan left, covering his face in an unsuccessful bid to avoid
recognition. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Ruiz suggested that Minotti should get in the car with
him.  Under the pretext of getting his coat, Minotti returned
inside to call Jordan for help.  Jordan suggested that Minotti call
the police and complain about Ruiz trespassing, which Minotti did. 
When the police arrived, Minotti informed them of his ostensible
role as Jordan's informant.  The police instructed Ruiz, who
eventually admitted to them that he was there to collect a drug
debt, to leave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At that point, Jordan apparently began to regret his role
in the scheme.  At 1:30 p.m. on December 26, Jordan called Agent
Drouin to inquire whether Ruiz was under investigation.  During
this conversation, Jordan asked whether the DEA had attempted any
surveillance of Ruiz on December 24.  Because Agent Drouin already
suspected Jordan of illegal activity, he told him that, while Ruiz
was a target, no operation had taken place on that particular day. 
In an apparent effort to cover his tracks, Jordan informed Agent
Drouin of certain, carefully-selected details regarding the drug
rip-off at the Medical Center.  Several of these details, however,
were false. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Next, Jordan contacted Minotti and suggested that they
return the cocaine to Ruiz or pay him for it.  Minotti communicated
to Bucci Jordan's desire to undo the robbery.  Bucci responded that
this rescission would be "stupid" and dangerous, as he believed
trying to rescind the robbery would confirm Ruiz's suspicions about
the rip-off, compounding their problems.  At a meeting in Stoneham,
Jordan returned a portion of his ill-gotten funds to Minotti, and
instructed him to give the money to Ruiz.  Despite his reluctance,
Bucci agreed to surrender his share of the proceeds to Minotti.  As
Bucci and Minotti attempted to gather the rest of the cocaine, they
received two frantic messages from Muolo indicating that something
bad had happened.  When they arrived at Muolo's apartment, he
informed them that he had flushed the cocaine down the toilet.</span>

Ruiz refused to cooperate fully against his suppliers in Mexico, he
agreed to provide information regarding the drug rip-off.  He
picked Minotti and Bucci out of a lineup.  Before Ruiz agreed to
cooperate, Agent Drouin called Jordan to inform him of Ruiz's
arrest, but Jordan expressed very little interest.</span></p>

chance, at a Dunkin' Donuts.  Muolo told Minotti that the police
had asked him to cooperate against Minotti.  He warned Minotti not
to answer the phone if he called and asked to meet at a baseball
field at 3:00 p.m.  Minotti relayed this information to Jordan, who
instructed Minotti to tell Muolo to "keep his mouth shut" and
indicated that he did not want to talk to Minotti anymore.  While
Minotti waited for Muolo at their designated meeting place, DEA
Agent Mark Tully and Sergeant Quin approached Minotti, who agreed
to cooperate by wearing a body wire to a meeting with Jordan.  </span></p>

Malden.  Although Jordan did not directly inculpate himself, he
made a plethora of highly suspicious statements that strongly
suggested that he was part of an unlawful conspiracy of some sort
with Minotti, Bucci, and Muolo.  The next day, May 20, Jordan
attempted to speak with Minotti at his home, but Minotti refused to
answer the door.  Later, however, at Sergeant Quin's request,
Minotti  placed a recorded call to Jordan.  During the call, Jordan
expressed further concern about Muolo, directing Minotti to tell
Muolo "not to give the bid out."</span></p>

of his wife's tanning salon in Malden as he attempted to enter his
black Mercedes.  After being informed of his rights, Bucci smugly
taunted the officers, "You didn't get me on any phones." 
Eventually, Bucci's black Mercedes was seized and its contents were
inventoried.  Of particular interest, the vehicle contained ninety-one grams of cocaine dispersed in three separate plastic baggies

above-mentioned items were probative of drug trafficking.  Officer
Cepero opined that the quantity of drugs found in Bucci's car,
ninety-one grams, is inconsistent with mere personal use.  Cepero

so deficient as to violate the Sixth Amendment and require reversal
of his convictions.  "We have held with a regularity bordering on

the trial court."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Leahy</span>, 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st

his trial counsel's purportedly deficient performance.  First, he
asserts that trial counsel, in his opening argument, promised to
the jury that he would present an alibi witness, Lisa Murphy, who
would testify that Bucci's activities on December 24 were
inconsistent with the Government's theory of the case.  Second,
Bucci complains that trial counsel addressed the prospective
testimony of Muolo during his opening statement, despite the fact
that the Government did not indicate an intention to call Muolo
during its own opening statement.  Third, Bucci contends that trial
counsel rendered deficient performance by failing to lay the
foundation for and offer the testimony of Ross Minnoti, Jon
Minotti's brother, who was purportedly willing to testify that Jon
Minotti informed him that Bucci was innocent, and that he was only
implicating Bucci to save his own skin.  These three issues are
best left for a collateral proceeding where Bucci will have the
opportunity to develop the record to explicate his claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Lastly, we address trial counsel's closing argument. 
During closing, trial counsel was twice admonished for making
improper remarks.  First, trial counsel asked rhetorically, "If
Br[y]an Raftery made those calls for Anthony Bucci, why didn't he
come in here and tell you about them?"  Following an objection by
the Government, the district court gave a forceful limiting
instruction, informing the jury that trial counsel's remarks were
improper and that "the government had intended to call Mr. Raftery
and he, Mr. Raftery, refused to testify.  He is absent in this case
because he refuses to be present."  Later, trial counsel accused
the Government of knowingly and deliberately presenting perjured
testimony.  Again, the district court instructed the jury that
trial counsel's actions were improper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;Undoubtedly, the limiting instructions issued by the
district judge in response to trial counsel's remarks did little to
advance Bucci's cause before the jury.  At the same time, these
events do not independently give rise to sufficient prejudice to
merit reversal of Bucci's convictions.  At worst, they may have
cost Bucci some of the good will of the jury.  The evidence against
Bucci was overwhelming, and trial counsel's comments and the
corresponding limiting instructions did nothing to add to the
mountain of inculpatory evidence arrayed against him.  Federal
agents observed Bucci's vehicle at Minotti's house the morning of
the rip-off; Bucci was observed by federal agents at the scene of
the crime, parked alongside Ruiz; the agents observed Bucci
speaking with Jordan outside the Medical Center immediately after
the rip-off; and cocaine, two digital scales, $6,653.00 in cash,
four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards, and a pager were
found in Bucci's vehicle upon his arrest.  Finally, of course,
Minotti's and, to a lesser extent, Ruiz's testimony directly
implicated Bucci in the crime. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bucci argues that the district court erred by denying his
motion to sever.  At issue is Exhibit 24, a recording of a May 19,
2004, conversation between Bucci's codefendant, Jordan, and
Minotti, in which Bucci's name is mentioned.  The recording was
properly introduced against Jordan as an admission.  The district
court ruled, however, that Jordan's statements were inadmissible
hearsay in relation to Bucci.  The district court denied Bucci's
pretrial motion to sever as well as his trial motion to redact his
name from the statements.  To protect Bucci from unfair prejudice,
the district court, on two separate occasions, instructed the jury
that the statements were not admissible against Bucci.  Bucci
concedes that his Confrontation Clause rights were not violated
because Jordan testified in his own defense at trial.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">California</span>
v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Green</span>, 399 U.S. 149, 164 (1970) (holding that "the Confrontation

constitutional law.</span></p>

court abused its wide discretion in refusing to grant separate
trials at the outset of the proceedings.  Our jurisprudence favors
trying co-conspirators together, despite the reality that evidence
admissible against one defendant may be, and often is, inadmissible
with regard to others.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">e.g.</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span>  We see no unusual

court committed reversible error by issuing a limiting instruction
rather than redacting Bucci's name from the recording and the
transcript provided to the jury.  Even where the Confrontation
Clause is implicated, we ordinarily presume that jurors will follow
limiting instructions.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span>&#160;v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rodr&iacute;guez-Dur&aacute;n</span>, 507 F.3d
749, 769 (1st Cir. 2007).  Occasionally, however, at least in the
constitutional context, a limiting instruction will not be
sufficient to preserve a co-defendant's rights where the
extrajudicial statement is "powerfully incriminating" and
"'inculpatory on its face.'"  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> (quoting <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Vega
Molina</span>, 407 F.3d 511, 520 (1st Cir. 2005)).  "Statements that are
incriminating only when linked to other evidence in the case" do
not merit such scrutiny.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> (quoting <span style="text-decoration: underline">Vega Molina</span>, 407 F.3d at
520) (internal quotation marks omitted).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The district court determined that Jordan's remarks,
while powerfully incriminating as to Jordan, did not directly
inculpate Bucci.  Significantly, defense counsel candidly and
explicitly agreed with this assessment while arguing Bucci's motion
to sever.  To be sure, Jordan's remarks were neither flattering nor
helpful to Bucci's defense.  The recording contains numerous
derisive references to Bucci as well as a discussion concerning
whether Bucci had been arrested and whether he was providing
information to law enforcement.  Thus, the recording surely implies
that Bucci participated with Jordan and Minotti in an illicit
undertaking of some species.  Nevertheless, we cannot say that the
district court erred by refusing to redact the recording to exclude
Bucci's name.  In light of our presumption that jurors follow
limiting instructions such as those given here, the absence of
constitutional error, and the inferential nature by which Jordan's
statements link Bucci to the charged conduct, we find no abuse of
discretion.  Moreover, any error was clearly harmless given the
substantial evidence of guilt as described above.</span>

restricted entirely to the prosecutor's discussion of Jordan. 
Neither the prosecutor nor the court were required to remind the
jurors by rote, in each instance the recording was mentioned, that
the recording was not admissible against Bucci.  We think that the
district court's two separate admonitions that the jurors should
not consider the May 19 recording as evidence against Bucci were
sufficient to prevent confusion.</span></p>

he called for a guilty verdict against both defendants, was
improper.  Following a brief discussion of Bucci's culpability, the

of the recording concerned Jordan alone.  The prosecutor had
already summed up his case regarding Bucci before discussing Jordan
for the final time.  By contrast, in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Vega Molina</span>, a case upon which
Bucci relies, the prosecutor explicitly requested the jury to
convict the defendant based on the co-defendant's out-of-court
confession, over the objection of the defendant and without a
limiting instruction.  407 F.3d at 522.  In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Richardson</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Marsh</span>,
481 U.S. 200 (1987), to which Bucci also cites, the prosecutor
argued that information gleaned from a codefendant's confession
supported an inference of guilt.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span>&#160;at 205 &amp; n.2.  Here, the

very little prejudice in the prosecutor's remarks.  As detailed
above, the evidence against Bucci was daunting and his theory of
innocence scarcely credible.  Moreover, the recording was not
highly incriminating of Bucci.  While it suggested that Jordan did
not consider him to be an exemplary citizen, the jury already knew
that from the contents of his black Mercedes.  Thus, the
prosecutor's comments during closing argument do not warrant
reversal of Bucci's convictions.</span></p>

of his convictions is necessary because the district court
committed structural error by closing the courtroom to the public

review only for plain error.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas</span>, Nos. 98-1051, 98-1052, 98-1116, 2000 WL 236481, at *2 (2d Cir. Feb. 14,

Bucci argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom
during jury selection and later during a contempt proceeding
against Raftery.  We decline to address his challenge to the
purported closure during jury selection at this time because it is
not yet ripe.  Although Bucci has attempted to submit additional
evidence to supplement the Spartan record, it remains inadequate to
permit meaningful review.  Bucci will have an opportunity, if he so
chooses, to present this argument in a petition for collateral
relief before the district court.  At that point, the district
court may hold an evidentiary hearing to test the merits of Bucci's
claim.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span> at 66.</span></p>

closing the courtroom during the contempt proceeding against
Raftery.  During this hearing, the Government called its next
prospective witness, Raftery, to the stand.  As expected, Raftery
refused to testify, despite a grant of immunity.  He indicated that
he was concerned about potential perjury charges due to conflicts
between his anticipated testimony and the statements he made before
the grand jury and federal agents.  The district court placed
Raftery in civil contempt and warned him of the possibility that
criminal contempt charges might be filed against him should he not
testify.  Despite these remonstrations, Raftery persisted in his
refusal to testify.  At the end of the hearing, the district court
ordered that Raftery be taken into immediate custody.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bucci's argument is flawed in two ways.  First, the Sixth
Amendment's requirement that a trial be public does not apply with
its usual force to criminal contempt proceedings.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Levine</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span>, 362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960).  Here, the district court
specifically indicated that Raftery would be set free if he agreed
to testify.  Thus, the contempt order was civil, not criminal, in
nature.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am.</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bagwell</span>,
512 U.S. 821, 827-28 (1994).  Civil contempt proceedings are not
governed by the Sixth Amendment and require fewer procedural
protections.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Winter</span>, 70 F.3d 655, 661 (1st
Cir. 1995) (stating that "a court may impose civil contempt
sanctions pursuant to .&#160;.&#160;.&#160;minimal procedures" but that "criminal
contempt sanctions may be imposed only if the court provides
certain constitutional protections"); <span style="text-decoration: underline">accord</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Santib&aacute;&ntilde;ez</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Weir

<span style="text-decoration: underline">In re Di Bella</span>, 518 F.2d 955, 958 (2nd Cir. 1975) (rejecting
challenge to courtroom closure in civil contempt context). 
Consequently, not even Raftery himself, much less Bucci, could have
invoked the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial during the
civil contempt hearing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Second, the contempt proceeding against Raftery was
almost entirely collateral to Bucci's own trial and, thus, any
closure did not infringe Bucci's Sixth Amendment right.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Petito</span>

against either defendant; the defendants and their counsel were
permitted to remain; and the courtroom was promptly reopened at the
conclusion of the contempt proceeding.  In the end, the temporal
proximity and causal relationship between Bucci's criminal trial
and the civil contempt hearing against Raftery did not necessarily
render the two proceedings one and the same.  Although Bucci
undoubtedly enjoyed a right to compulsory process under the Sixth
Amendment to call Raftery as a witness, he lacked any converse
right to prevent him from testifying.  Put differently, he had no
cognizable constitutional interest under the Sixth Amendment in
Raftery's refusal to testify when called by the Government.  Thus,
although it would have been better practice for the trial judge to
have made specific record findings justifying his decision to close
the courtroom, <span style="text-decoration: underline">see</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Waller</span>, 467 U.S. at 44-47, on these facts and
under a plain error standard of review, Bucci suffered no

argument with his variance claim.  Rather than engage in a futile
endeavor to parse the two, we address them simultaneously.  His
underlying challenge lacks merit under either theory.  First, Bucci
asserts that while the indictment alleged a conspiracy to
distribute cocaine, the evidence at trial supported only a
conspiracy to commit robbery.  Second, Bucci contends that the
indictment was faulty because it failed to allege a Hobbs Act
conspiracy.  Bucci asserts that this failure prejudiced him because
some of the jurors may have relied upon the drug rip-off to convict
Bucci of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bucci's challenges appear to rest upon two faulty
premises.  First, while it is possible that the evidence could have
supported other charges, a grand jury is under no obligation to
indict every conceivable crime potentially implicated by a
defendant's conduct.  The possible Hobbs Act violation Bucci
describes is not mutually exclusive with the charges contained
within the indictment.  Second, Bucci's argument consists of little
more than utter speculation that the jury disregarded its
instructions by convicting him of an uncharged offense.  Given the
substantial evidence indicating that Bucci did, in fact, conspire
to possess and distribute cocaine, we cannot infer that any jurors
decided that Bucci did not conspire to possess and distribute
cocaine, but convicted him of that offense, heedless of the law, on
the basis that he conspired to commit robbery.  He has utterly
failed to demonstrate either a constructive amendment of the
indictment or a variance between the indictment and the evidence
adduced at trial.  He cannot obtain relief on the counterintuitive
theory that the jury could have convicted him of other, additional
crimes that were neither charged nor detailed in the jury
instructions.</span></p>

of the conspiracy.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> at 5-6.  Such reliance is mistaken.  In
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Medina-Roman</span>, the defendant was not notified of potential <span style="text-decoration: underline">Pinkerton</span>

to the higher standard associated with aiding and abetting. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Medina-Roman</span>, 376 F.3d at 3 n.4, 6.  Here, the district court

instructions were erroneous because they presented the jury with an
unfair Hobson's choice.  He reasons that the instructions precluded

logic.  The jury could, of course, have found Bucci not guilty of
Count 3 if it either (a) rejected the government's evidence of
conspiracy or (b) determined that Jordan's use of the firearm in
furtherance of the conspiracy was not reasonably foreseeable and
that Bucci had no actual knowledge that it would be used.  It is
permissible for the government to present evidence of guilt tending

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Finally, Bucci argues in his <span style="text-decoration: underline">pro se</span> brief that the
district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines violated
the Sixth Amendment.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span>, 543 U.S. 220
(2005).  As an initial matter, we categorically reject Bucci's
argument that the remedial <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span>&#160;opinion was only a temporary fix
subject to an expiration date.  While the remedial majority may
have invited Congress to take independent action, <span style="text-decoration: underline">see</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span> at 265,
it contains no indication of eventual constitutional infirmity in
the absence of a Congressional mandate.  More specifically, we have
held that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span> requires reversal only where judicial fact-finding
increases the statutory maximum penalty.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Antonakopoulos</span>, 399 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir. 2005).  The 168 month
sentence Bucci received for drug trafficking and the 84 month
sentence he received for the weapons charge were both near the low
end of the guidelines' ranges, far below the statutory maximums. 
Thus, Bucci's claim of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span> error is without merit.</span></p>

permitting the Government to redact portions of the recording  and

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Peculiarly, the Government maintains that the purview of
Rule 106 is limited to the order of proof.  To the contrary, our
case law unambiguously establishes that the rule of completeness
may be invoked to facilitate the introduction of otherwise
inadmissible evidence.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span>&#160;v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Simonelli</span>, 237 F.3d
19, 28 (1st Cir. 2001); <span style="text-decoration: underline">Awon</span>, 135 F.3d at 101.  Other circuits have
held differently, <span style="text-decoration: underline">see,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">e.g.</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mitchell</span>, 502 F.3d
931, 965 n.9 (9th Cir. 2007), but we adhere to our own precedent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its
discretion by refusing to require the Government to present the
redacted portions of the December 24 conversation.  Jordan contends
that fairness required the admission of the redacted portions
because they undermined the credibility of Minotti and Ruiz and
because the excerpts were unduly fragmented and confusing.  Neither
of these arguments is well-founded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>First, we address the issue of credibility.  As an
initial matter, we note that the district court permitted defense
counsel to use the redacted statements in cross-examination, and
that defense counsel did so effectively.  Although timing may be
important in some situations, we see no such prejudice here. 
Moreover, the record is pellucid that defense counsel had abundant
opportunity to impeach both Ruiz and Minotti on numerous different
grounds.  During the extensive cross-examination, defense counsel
was able to reveal the witnesses' myriad (and typically self-serving) inconsistencies and general dishonesty; drug abuse; drug
dealing and other lawbreaking; use of foul and offensive language;
and the inducement provided by the Government.  Frankly, given the
record before us, it is hard to imagine that the jury could have
found either Ruiz or Minotti to be credible absent the
corroboratory evidence supplied by the Government.  If the jury
credited their testimony at all, it did so with full knowledge that
both men were scoundrels motivated by the carrot of reduced
sentences (and, in Ruiz's case, revenge).  Additional impeachment
would have been cumulative.  Thus, the district court acted well
within its expansive discretion by refusing to require the
introduction of the redacted portions of the December 24
conversation pursuant to Rule 106.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Jordan's second contention fares only slightly better. 
On appeal, Jordan argues that the excerpts of the December 24
conversation are confusing, but he fails to point to specific
portions that might suggest prejudicial ambiguity.  Having
independently reviewed the evidence, we hold that any error was
harmless.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We acknowledge that one excerpt might initially have
generated some confusion.  The redacted transcript reads:</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">[Ruiz]:  Look, first of all look . . . how did
.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;the guy know that I was going to go back

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">[Minotti]:  You're out of your mind. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">[Ruiz]:  I already told Tommy to get me his
.&#160;.&#160;. address, if you don't give [it] to me[.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">Exh. 8(c) (second alteration in original).  In context, it is clear
that Ruiz's first statement refers to his second encounter with
Jordan at the Malden Medical Center, when he went back to the scene
in search of his cocaine.  The second statement by Ruiz, as
clarified by the redacted material, refers to Bucci.  Without the
redacted portions, however, Ruiz's second statement appears to
refer to Jordan instead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Nevertheless, the error was harmless.  First, it is
difficult to see how the mistaken impression possibly caused by the
excerpts might have prejudiced Jordan.  The evidence clearly
established that Ruiz believed Jordan to be either a counterfeit or
corrupt policeman.  Second, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Government</span> actually clarified on
direct examination that Ruiz was referring to "Gino," not Jordan. 
Finally, as explained above, Jordan was afforded ample opportunity
to correct any possible misapprehensions by extensive cross
examination.</span></p>
