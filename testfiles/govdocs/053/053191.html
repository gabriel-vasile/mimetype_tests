  manifestations of hate are legion, but the hate process itself remains elusive.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Limited 
  research in this field precluded the development of a comprehensive hate model. 
  Understanding hate groups is essential for the development and implementation 
  of successful intervention strategies, which depend on an understanding of the 
  hate process. The proposed hate model consists of seven stages, including how 
  hate groups define themselves, how hate groups target their victims and taunt 
  them with verbal insults and offensive gestures, and how hate groups attack 
  their victims with or without weapons.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">1</font></sup>

<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">DEFINITION 
  OF HATE</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate, 
  a complex subject, divides into two general categories: rational and irrational. 
  Unjust acts inspire rational hate. Hatred of a person based on race, religion, 
  sexual orientation, ethnicity, or national origin constitutes irrational hate.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Both 
  rational and irrational hate mask personal insecurities. Everyone experiences 
  personal insecurities in varying degrees throughout their lives. The more insecure 
  a person feels, the larger the hate mask. Most people concentrate on the important 
  issues in life, such as earning a living, rearing a family, and achieving personal 
  goals. These</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">pursuits 
  give meaning and value to life.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">2</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Nonetheless, irrational hate bleeds through day-to-day activities in the form 
  of racial barbs and ethnic humor. Not all insecure people are haters, but all 
  haters are insecure people.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">With 
  respect to rational hate, haters do not focus as much on the wrong done to them 
  or others, but, rather, on their own helplessness, guilt, or inability to effect 
  change. The object of rational hate often is despised or pitied.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">3</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  In the same way, irrational hate elevates the hater above the hated.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">4</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Many insecure people feel a sense of self-worth by relegating a person or group 
  of people to a lower status.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">5</font></sup>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">SKINHEAD 
  GROUPS</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">During 
  a 7-year FBI investigation of skinhead groups in Southern California between 
  1992 and 1999, specific patterns emerged. Skinhead groups typically consist 
  of uneducated, young, white males between the ages of 13 and 24 who have no 
  long-term prospects for success. Although many come from single-parent, dysfunctional 
  families, some exceptions exist. For example, members of the Western Hammerskins 
  in Hemet, California, had high school educations and came from two-parent, middle-class 
  families. Further examination revealed that both parents made long, daily commutes 
  to work in Los Angeles and left their teenage children unsupervised. The lack 
  of parental supervision and guidance spawned personal insecurities similar to 
  those found in skinheads who come from dysfunctional, single-parent environments.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Fortunately, 
  most skinhead groups are not well organized and</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">lack 
  the leadership structure found in the majority of street gangs engaged in &#8220;for-profit&#8221; 
  criminal activities. However, the Western Hammerskins group has a stronger leadership 
  hierarchy than most skinhead groups, and it boasts a very active recruitment 
  program. Potential members receive a recruitment package, which includes a swastika 
  armband, a T-shirt with white supremacist slogans, white supremacist literature 
  and band stickers, and other supremacist materials. Recruiters also pass out 
  business cards embossed with the Western Hammerskins&#8217; logo and the recruiter&#8217;s 
  name and telephone number. The group&#8217;s higher educational level may explain 
  the sophistication of its recruitment techniques.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Skinhead 
  groups subdivide into two categories: criminally motivated and hate motivated. 
  Criminally motivated skinhead groups spend most of their time engaged in for-profit 
  criminal activities, such</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">as 
  drug sales and burglaries. Incidental to their criminal activity, they commit 
  hate crimes. The San Fernando Valley Peckerwoods (SVP) in California was a criminally 
  motivated skinhead group. SVP members primarily sold meth-amphetamines and committed 
  residential burglaries. Periodically, SVP members attacked minorities with weapons 
  and, on one occasion, placed packages resembling bombs near an apartment complex 
  where African-Americans lived. Members intended for the fake bombs to frighten 
  current residents to relocate and to discourage other African-American families 
  from moving into the complex.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Conversely, 
  hate-motivated skinhead groups dedicate the majority of their time to hate crimes.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">6 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Incidental 
  to hate crimes, these hard-core skinheads commit petty thefts or sell small 
  amounts of narcotics to support daily needs, such as food, cigarettes, and alcohol 
  and other drugs. The Nazi Low Riders (NLR) skinhead group located in Lancaster, 
  California, exemplifies a hate-motivated skinhead group. At one time, NLR members 
  spent their time prowling the streets of Lancaster looking for minorities to 
  attack. The NLR matured to the point where their members routinely beat and 
  stabbed minorities, and, in one instance, murdered an African-American.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Haters 
  cannot stop hating without exposing their personal insecurities. For example, 
  at the onset of the FBI investigation, FBI authorities told hard-core members 
  of the NLR that they would arrest them if their hate violence continued; yet, 
  the hate violence persisted. The FBI</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">similarly 
  warned the members of the SVP who, however, stopped or were more surreptitious 
  concerning criminal activities, and their hate violence ceased. The reaction 
  of the SVP members comported with general criminal deterrence literature.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">7 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  reaction of the NLR members did not, however, because hate, not criminal acts, 
  was their primary motive.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Interviews 
  of both criminally motivated and hate-motivated skinheads may explain this phenomenon. 
  Criminally motivated skinheads identified themselves as criminals first and 
  haters second. They also expressed a degree of personal security in their status 
  as criminals. The criminally motivated skinheads possess a certain sense of 
  self-worth; hence, they have fewer insecurities. However, this was not the case 
  with hate-motivated skinheads. The explanation by one 15-year-old NLR member 
  typified the thought process of hate-motivated skinheads. He said, in effect, 
  &#8220;I dropped out of school in the eighth grade, but I stopped learning midway 
  through the sixth grade. I covered my body with hate tattoos. I couldn&#8217;t 
  get a good job if I wanted to. No one would hire me. Once, I tried to get a 
  job at a fast food restaurant, but the manager refused to hire me because the 
  restaurant served multiracial customers. If I quit being a skinhead, I have 
  nothing. I am nothing. I have no choice but to be a skinhead. I expect to die 
  a young, violent death.&#8221; Skinheads converge, get drunk, take drugs, and, 
  at some point, spontaneously seek out hate targets to attack. They conduct little, 
  if any, planning before committing</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">hate 
  crimes. One hate-motivated skinhead put it best when he stated, &#8220;We don&#8217;t 
  look for trouble but somehow trouble always finds us, and we&#8217;re ready to 
  deal with it when it comes.&#8221;</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">THE 
  HATE MODEL</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Several 
  academic authorities on hate crimes in America identified three types of bias 
  crime offenders: the thrill seeker, the reactive offender, and the hard-core 
  offender.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">8 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">They 
  described the reactive offender as one &#8220;who grounds his attack on a perceived 
  transgression,</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">such 
  as an insult, interracial dating, or a neighborhood integration.&#8221;</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">9 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  authors&#8217; model incorporates the thrill seeker and the hard-core offender, 
  but redefines the concept of the reactive offender. This phenomenon can be described 
  as secondary justification; skinheads routinely use this technique to instigate 
  attacks. For example, a group of skinheads encounter a mixed-race couple and 
  shout racial slurs. If the couple reacts in a manner other than a submissive 
  one, the skinheads perceive that behavior as an act of aggression. The skinheads 
  later tell the police they merely defended themselves against aggressors. The 
  skinheads, of course, leave out the</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">fact 
  that they acted as the instigators. Secondary justification is difficult to 
  detect because skinheads can interpret a simple glance as aggressive behavior.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Secondary 
  justification also exists on a larger scale. When a community reacts to a hate 
  crime, skinheads perceive that reaction as aggressive, which reinforces the 
  notion that skinheads must defend themselves against a common enemy. Secondary 
  justification places the skinheads in a victim status and rationalizes continued 
  violence. To further illustrate this principle, a skinhead, with a swastika 
  tattooed on his cheek, walked into a jewelry store to buy a ring for his girlfriend. 
  The skinhead became incensed when the Jewish clerk treated him poorly. The skinhead 
  later commented that if Jews treated him with more respect he would not hate 
  them so much. The skinhead clearly saw himself as a victim, although he openly 
  displayed a provocative symbol of hate on his face.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Empirical 
  observations show that hate groups go through seven stages in the hate process. 
  Haters, if unimpeded, pass through these seven successive stages without skipping 
  a stage. In the first four stages, haters vocalize their beliefs. In the last 
  three stages, haters act on their beliefs. A transition period exists between 
  vocalization and acting out. In this transition period, violence separates hard-core 
  haters from rhetorical haters.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Stage 
  1: The Haters Gather</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Irrational 
  haters seldom hate alone.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">10</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  They feel compelled, almost driven, to entreat others to hate as they do. Peer 
  validation</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">bolsters 
  a sense of self-worth and, at the same time, prevents introspection, which reveals 
  personal insecurities.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">11</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Further, individuals otherwise ineffective become empowered when they join groups, 
  which also provide anonymity and diminished accountability.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Stage 
  2: The Hate Group Defines Itself</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate 
  groups form identities through symbols, rituals, and mythologies, which enhance 
  the members&#8217; status and, at the same time, degrade the object of their 
  hate. For example, skinhead groups may adopt the swastika, the iron cross, the 
  Confederate flag, and other su-premacist symbols. Group-specific symbols or 
  clothing often differentiate hate groups. Group rituals, such as hand signals 
  and secret greetings, further fortify members. Hate groups, especially skinhead 
  groups, usually incorporate some form of self-sacrifice, which allows haters 
  to willingly jeopardize their well-being for the greater good of the cause. 
  Giving one&#8217;s life to a cause provides the ultimate sense of value and worth 
  to life.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">12</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Skinheads often see themselves as soldiers in a race war.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Stage 
  3: The Hate Group Disparages the Target</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate 
  is the glue that binds haters to one another and to a common cause.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">13</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  By verbally debasing the object of their hate, haters enhance their self-image, 
  as well as their group status. In skinhead groups, racist song lyrics and hate 
  literature provide an environment wherein hate flourishes. In fact, researchers 
  have found that the life span of</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">aggressive 
  impulses increases with ideation.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">14</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  In other words, the more often a person thinks about aggression, the greater 
  the chance for aggressive behavior to occur. Thus, after constant verbal denigration, 
  haters progress to the next more acrimonious stage.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Stage 
  4: The Hate Group Taunts the Target</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate, 
  by its nature, changes incrementally. Time cools the fire of hate, thus forcing 
  the hater to look inward. To avoid introspection, haters use ever-increasing 
  degrees of rhetoric and violence to maintain high levels of agitation. Taunts 
  and</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">offensive 
  gestures serve this purpose. In this stage, skinheads typically shout racial 
  slurs from moving cars or from afar. Nazi salutes and other hand signals often 
  accompany racial epithets. Racist graffiti also begins to appear in areas where 
  skinheads loiter. Most skinhead groups claim turf proximate to the neighborhoods 
  in which they live. One study indicated that a majority of hate crimes occur 
  when the hate target migrates through the hate group&#8217;s turf.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">15</font></sup> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Stage 
  5: The Hate Group Attacks the Target Without Weapons</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">This 
  stage is critical because it differentiates vocally abusive haters from physically 
  abusive ones. In this stage, hate groups become more aggressive, prowling their 
  turf seeking vulnerable targets. Violence coalesces hate groups and further 
  isolates them from mainstream society. Skinheads, almost without exception, 
  attack in groups and target single victims. Research has shown that bias crimes 
  are twice as likely to cause injury and four times as likely to result in hospitalization 
  as compared to nonbias crimes.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">16

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">In 
  addition to physical violence, the element of thrill seeking is introduced in

  firearms to commit hate crimes, but skinheads prefer weapons, such as broken 
  bottles, baseball bats, blunt objects, screwdrivers, and belt buckles. These 
  types of weapons require the attacker to be close to the victim, which further 
  demonstrates the depth of personal anger. Attackers can discharge firearms at 
  a distance, thus precluding personal contact. Close-in onslaughts require the 
  assailants to see their victims eye-to-eye and to become bloodied during the 
  assault. Hands-on violence allows skinheads to express their hate in a way a 
  gun cannot. Personal contact empowers and fulfills a deep-seated need to have 
  dominance over others.</font> </p>

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  ultimate goal of haters is to destroy the object of their hate. Mastery over 
  life and death imbues the hater with godlike power and omnipotence, which, in 
  turn, facilitate further acts of violence. With this power comes a great sense 
  of self-worth and value, the very qualities haters lack. However, in reality, 
  hate physically and psychologically destroys both the hater and the hated.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Model 
  Application</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Anecdotal 
  evidence suggests that this hate model has a wider application. For example, 
  when a coworker becomes a hate target for reasons other than race, sex, or national 
  origin, the hater immediately seeks out others in the office who dislike, or 
  can be persuaded to dislike, the hated coworker (Stage 1). The group establishes 
  an identity using symbols and behaviors. They</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">use 
  a lifted eyebrow, a code word to exclude the hated coworker from a lunch invitation, 
  or any number of other actions to demean and isolate. The haters even may adopt 
  a name for their group (Stage 2). At this point, the haters only disparage the 
  hated coworker within their group (Stage 3). As time passes, the haters openly 
  insult the hated coworker either directly or indirectly by allowing disparaging 
  remarks to be overheard from afar (Stage 4). One morning, the hated coworker 
  discovers his desk rearranged and</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">offensive 
  images pasted over a picture depicting his wife and children (Stage 5). From 
  the sophomoric to the terroristic, acts of hate have the same effect. Eventually, 
  the haters sabotage the hated coworker&#8217;s projects and attempt to ruin the 
  individual&#8217;s reputation through rumors and innuendoes (Stage 6). In so 
  doing, the haters make the work environment intolerable for the hate target 
  (Stage 7). Scenarios like this occur every day across America and, indeed, around 
  the world. The targets of hate may change, but the hate process remains constant.</font>

</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Assessing 
  and analyzing skinhead groups can help investigators tailor intervention strategies 
  to each hate group, thus increasing the probability of successful intervention 
  and rehabilitation. Law enforcement can assess a skinhead group by first determining 
  if the group is hate motivated or criminally motivated. The best method to establish 
  motivation is through one-on-one interviews, although reviewing police reports 
  and criminal histories prove adequate determining factors as well.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Second, 
  investigators should measure the maturity of the group, which is not determined 
  by the chronological age of the group&#8217;s members but by the collective actions 
  of the group. Violence constitutes an important maturation indicator. Comparing 
  the group&#8217;s activities to the stages in the hate model can determine the 
  maturity of a skinhead group. Mature groups commit more violent acts than immature 
  groups.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">An 
  additional step in the assessment process involves gauging the strength of the 
  group&#8217;s mythology. Immature groups have simple mythologies, whereas mature 
  groups have more complex and stubborn mythologies. Studying group mythologies 
  proves difficult because they represent the aggregate of a group&#8217;s common 
  beliefs, experiences, symbols, and rituals.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">SYMBOLS,

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Fully 
  understanding hate groups involves identifying and defining their unique symbols, 
  rituals, and mythologies. Symbols give</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">greater 
  meaning to irrational hate. Haters use symbols for self-identification and to 
  form common bonds with other group members. Additionally, they often swear allegiance 
  to these symbols. For example, the swastika, a simple symbol, served as a powerful 
  rallying point for the Nazi movement and helped mobilize an entire country.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">21 
  </font></sup></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Each 
  hate group adopts its own symbols or borrows them from others. Symbolic words 
  and nonverbal behaviors reflect individual disdain and serve as advertisements 
  to attract fellow sympathizers. Offensive language is the most common expression 
  of dislike for others. Hate groups also display contempt by using nonverbal 
  gestures, such as a Nazi salute. Clothes, short haircuts, military boots, tattoos, 
  and bumper stickers also represent symbols that can effectively communicate 
  hate.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Symbols, 
  however, are not enough to unify a group; therefore, more organized hate groups

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  hate group&#8217;s experiences, beliefs, and use of symbols and rituals combine

  TECHNIQUES</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Ironically, 
  skinheads, especially hate-motivated skinheads, talk to anyone who will listen, 
  including law enforcement officers. One investigator who knew little about white-supremacist 
  ideology simply asked skinheads why they hated, what their tattoos meant, and 
  how skinhead groups were organized. Numerous interviews and observations substantiated 
  the initial information obtained by the investigator. On the other hand, criminally 
  motivated skinheads are less likely to talk because they act more like criminals. 
  Investigators should determine the motivation of skinheads when planning interview 
  strategies.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate-motivated 
  skinheads have well-rehearsed answers for</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">questions, 
  such as &#8220;Why do you hate?&#8221; &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see what you&#8217;re 
  doing is wrong?&#8221; &#8220;How would you like it if someone picked on you because 
  of your race?&#8221; Skinheads answer smugly; they feel secure as skinheads. 
  Because hate masks personal insecurities, interviewers should temporarily forego 
  questions about why skinheads hate and strive to identify the skinheads&#8217; 
  personal insecurities. Interviewers should begin this probe by asking skinheads 
  about their family relationships, which probably represent the source of the 
  skinhead&#8217;s insecurities because a sense of who people are and where they 
  fit in society typically develops within the family structure. Interviewers 
  also should explore skinheads&#8217; future plans, educational goals, and desired 
  employment. This forces skinheads to see themselves as they really are. If forced 
  to look at themselves, skinheads become vulnerable, less resistant to rehabilitation, 
  and, in law enforcement settings, more likely to confess. This process could 
  take several hours or many months depending on the resistance level of the skinhead.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">This 
  strategy proves less effective when interviewing criminally motivated skinheads 
  because they view themselves as criminals who hate, rather than haters who commit 
  criminal acts. More traditional interviewing strategies have proven successful 
  with criminally motivated skinheads.</font> </p>

  accurate assessment of skinhead groups is critical to developing intervention 
  strategies.</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Dismantling 
  immature skinhead groups proves easier than breaking down sophisticated skinhead 
  groups. Skinheads not solidly committed to supremacist ideology more likely 
  will respond to rehabilitation attempts than hard-core skinheads.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">25</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Skinheads who have not passed from Stage 4 (rhetoric) to Stage 5 (violence) 
  will prove more receptive to rehabilitation strategies than those skinheads 
  who commit violence.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Investigators 
  should approach criminally motivated skinhead groups by using tactics similar 
  to those used against criminal street gangs. Disrupting the activities of mature, 
  hate-motivated skinhead groups requires time and more elaborate interdiction 
  strategies because such groups are more unified and committed to their beliefs. 
  Conversely, aggressive prosecution constitutes an efficient means to disrupt 
  immature, hate-motivated skinhead groups.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Law 
  enforcement used this technique to dismantle Peer Pride, an immature, hate-motivated 
  skinhead group in Palmdale, Cali-fornia. The FBI learned about Peer Pride when 
  the group hung a noose from a tree in front of the home of an African-American 
  family. Five Peer Pride members taunted the family with racial slurs and demanded 
  that they move out of the neighborhood. Local law enforcement initially treated 
  this incident as a prank because hanging the noose was the only reported hate 
  activity by the group. However, a neighborhood canvass determined that Peer 
  Pride members periodically sat in front of a local fast food restaurant and 
  shouted racial slurs</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">at 
  the African-American patrons. Instead of leniency for the first-time offenders, 
  the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#8217;s Hate Crimes Unit recommended 
  harsh sanctions, including jail sentences. The effect was immediate. The group 
  disbanded and no other similar problems occurred in the neighborhood. The incident, 
  in and of itself, could have been interpreted as a prank, but, in reality, the 
  group was passing from Stage 3 to Stage 4 in the hate model.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">In 
  contrast, the Lancaster NLR group was a mature, hate-motivated skinhead group. 
  Four NLR members beat an African-American transient to death to earn the right 
  to wear lightning-bolt tattoos. According to the group&#8217;s ritual, members 
  only can earn lightning-bolt tattoos by killing minorities. A review of police 
  reports related to NLR criminal activities clearly showed the NLR group progressing 
  through the seven stages of the hate model.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">School 
  administrators and teachers can use the hate model to informally assess hate 
  group activities on campus. Identifying the stage in which a hate group is</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">operating 
  provides valuable information to determine how dangerous the group is and what 
  type of intervention strategies to employ. Early intervention increases the 
  probability of success, especially before the transition period from rhetoric 
  (Stage 4) to violence (Stage 5). These strategies can range from informal sensitivity 
  instruction to more formal programs, such as the Juvenile Offenders Learning 
  Tolerance (JOLT) program administrated by the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#8217;s 
  Office Hate Crimes Unit. JOLT is a model intervention program intended for firsttime, 
  low-level offenders who face potential criminal prosecution and school disciplinary 
  action.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
  To develop and implement successful intervention strategies to deal with hate 
  groups, law enforcement personnel first must understand the hate process. The 
  hate model identifies the multiple stages of the hate process. Investigators 
  can use this model to identify haters who have not yet transitioned from hate 
  rhetoric to hate violence and target them with intervention programs,<br>
  which have a higher probability of success. Likewise, law enforcement personnel 
  can identify and target hard-core haters with appropriate interdiction strategies. 
  Knowing how the hate process works helps interviewers penetrate the hate mask 
  and address the hater&#8217;s underlying personal insecurities. If investigators 
  can attenuate these personal insecurities, haters will become more receptive 
  to rehabilitation. Identifying and understanding the stages of the hate <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">process 
  constitute the first steps in controlling hate violence.</font> </p>

  Cyberstalking<br>
  Understanding<br>
  Investigative Hurdles</font><br>
  By ROBERT D&#8217;OVIDIO, M.S., and JAMES DOYLE </p>
<p align="left">By enabling human interaction without the constraints of physical 
  barriers and with <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">the 
  perception of anonymity, the Internet has become the ideal instrument for individuals 
  who wish to intimidate, threaten, and harass others. A stalker can use the Internet 
  to send alarming messages anywhere, within a matter of moments, under the guise 
  of a fictitious screen name or pseudonym. Understanding how offenders use the 
  Internet to stalk victims in cyberspace can provide law</font> enforcement officers 
  with solutions when they encounter impediments<br>
  investigating these types of cases.</p>

  have begun to appear more frequently. These headlines depict stories of</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">criminal intimidation, 
  harassment, fear, and suggestive violence where individuals use the Internet 
  as a tool to stalk another person. The term </font><i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">cyberstalking</font></i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  has emerged to describe the use of such technology to harass or stalk.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">3</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Cyberstalking is defined as the repeated use of the Internet, e-mail, or related 
  digital electronic communication devices to annoy, alarm, or threaten a specific 
  individual or group of individuals.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">All 
  50 states and the federal government have enacted statutes aimed at protecting 
  the victims of stalking. Many of these statutes have existed for a long time, 
  while others have originated recently. Some of the older statutes were broad 
  enough to cover any type of stalking behavior, including cyberstalking; others 
  had to be amended to do so. In some jurisdictions, new laws specifically addressing 
  the problem of cyber-stalking have been enacted. In adapting general stalking 
  and harassment statutes to cover instances of cyberstalking, legislators have 
  expanded the means by which offenders commit this crime to include electronic 
  communication devices.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Several 
  states currently include specific protections against threatening electronically 
  transmitted communications in their stalking or harassment statutes.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">4</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Additionally, Title 18, Section 875, U.S. Code, criminalizes threatening messages 
  transmitted electronically in interstate or foreign commerce. The use of federal 
  legislation to prosecute cases of cyberstalking, however, is limited, by law, 
  to</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">instances 
  where the harassing messages are transmitted across state lines or outside the 
  United States. Despite the existence of Title 18, Section 875, the federal government 
  historically has limited its involvement in prosecuting cases related to electronically 
  transmitted threatening messages to cases involving special circumstances, such 
  as threats made against the president of the United States. As with stalking 
  that does not involve the Internet, local authorities investigate and prosecute 
  most cyber-stalking cases in either the jurisdiction where the victim resides 
  or in the jurisdiction where the messages originated.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">With 
  the rapid pace of technological advancement that exists in today&#8217;s society, 
  legislation should take an evolutionary approach toward defining electronic 
  communication devices and systems of transmission. Legislation that limits electronic 
  devices and transmission systems to specific technologies, such as telephones 
  and land-based wires, risk becoming antiquated with the emergence of new technologies, 
  such as computers and wireless transmission systems.</font> </p>

</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Anticipating 
  the significant role computers would play in the commission of crimes in the 
  future, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) developed the Computer Investigation 
  &amp; Technology Unit (CITU) in 1995. CITU investigates cases where offenders 
  use a</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">computer 
  or the Internet as an instrument to commit a crime or where a computer represents 
  the target of a crime or constitutes a source of evidence relating to a crime. 
  The unit also performs outreach services to business and community groups to 
  educate people on computer ethics, safe Internet practices, and data security 
  issues related to the most current practices of computer hackers. Additionally, 
  CITU provides training and technical assistance to local, state, and federal 
  law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Methodology</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  authors used official police records from NYPD&#8217;s CITU to capture data on 
  the extent and nature of cyberstalking for this study. Specifically, the data 
  for this study were drawn from information</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">contained 
  within standardized forms filed by the complainant at the time of the initial 
  complaint and standardized investigative forms that detail the progress of the 
  investigation from beginning to end. Data were gathered using all closed cases 
  of aggravated harassment</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">5</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  investigated by NYPD from January 1996 through August 2000 in which criminals 
  used a computer or the Internet as the instrument of the offense. In addition 
  to the date of the offense, descriptive information was gathered on the victim, 
  the offender, the outcome of the case, the method used to harass, and whether 
  the victim and suspect resided in the same jurisdiction.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Extent 
  of the Problem</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">When 
  compared to other cybercrimes, cyberstalking has been the most prevalent crime</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">reported to 
  and investigated by CITU since the unit&#8217;s inception. During the 56-month 
  period from January 1996 through August 2000, 42.8 percent of the cases investigated 
  by CITU involved aggravated harassment by means of a computer or the Internet. 
  Additional CITU investigations during this period involved grand larceny, computer 
  and network trespassing, forgery, petty larceny, criminal impersonation, child 
  pornography, crimes against children, and schemes to defraud. Understanding 
  the distribution of cybercrimes is essential to allocating a computer crime 
  unit&#8217;s resources in a cost-efficient manner. Training that provides investigators 
  with the technical knowledge and procedural experience needed to successfully 
  investigate cyberstalking should be a priority for a computer crime unit. Agencies 
  should note that the technical training needed to successfully investigate cases 
  of cyberstalking is not entirely crime specific and will prove useful when investigating 
  other types of computer-related crime.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">An 
  examination of case outcomes revealed that 192 of the 201 cyberstalking cases 
  investigated by CITU were closed during the 56-month period of this study. Approximately 
  40 percent of the cases were closed with an arrest, and almost 11 percent of 
  the cases failed to produce evidence that a crime was committed. CITU closed 
  the remaining cases after finding evidence to support the victim&#8217;s complaint 
  due to a jurisdictional issue, an uncooperative complainant, a case transfer, 
  or exhausting</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">all 
  investigative leads without positively identifying a specific offender.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Offender 
  characteristics were examined using the 134 closed cases where a suspect was 
  arrested or where evidence to support an arrest existed but a suspect was not 
  arrested because of an uncooperative complainant or a jurisdictional issue. 
  The results revealed that</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">males 
  (approximately 80 percent of the cases) were more likely than females to commit 
  aggravated harassment using a computer or the Internet. Approximately 74 percent 
  of the offenders were white, 13 percent Asian, 8 percent Hispanic, and 5 percent 
  black. The average age of the offender was 24, with the oldest offender being 
  53 years old and the youngest being 10 years old. Approximately 26 percent of 
  offenders were juveniles, according to New York State law, or under the age 
  of 16.</font> </p>

  percent of the cases, whereas males were the victims of aggravated harassment 
  in approximately 35 percent. Educational institutions represented the next most 
  likely target with 8 percent. Offenders chose private corporations in almost 
  5 percent of the cases. Public-sector agencies were targeted in about 1 percent 
  of the cases.</font> </p>

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">In 
  92 percent of the cases, offenders used only one method to stalk their victims. 
  E-mail was used most often. Offenders used e-mail to harass their victims in 
  approximately 79 percent of the cases. The second method most often used by 
  offenders was the instant messenger. Offenders used instant messengers to harass 
  their victims in about 13 percent of the cases. Chat rooms were used in approximately 
  8 percent of the cases, while message boards and Web sites were used respectively 
  in 4 percent and 2 percent of the cases. Last, offenders employed newsgroups 
  and false user profiles in approximately 1 percent of the cases.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Cyberstalking Methods</b></p>
<p align="left">Cyberstalkers have employed various methods of Internet communication 
  to harass their victims. Although not exhaustive, the following list describes 
  some of the methods that cyberstalkers may use:</p>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote> </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">&#8226; E-mail: A method of communication that allows an individual 
    to transfer text, picture, video, and audio files to another person&#8217;s 
    electronic mailbox. In using e-mail to harass, the cyberstalker creates a 
    textbased, graphic-based, or audio-based message of a threatening, alarming, 
    or otherwise harassing nature and sends it to the e-mail account of the intended 
    victim.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; Newsgroups: A method of communication that amounts to an ongoing discussion 
    about a particular topic.Internet users contribute to the ongoing discussion 
    by posting their opinions, comments, or related experiences about a particular 
    subject. These postings are linked together and can be retrieved by querying 
    a database of newsgroup topics. Cyberstalkers can use these forums to post 
    threatening or defamatory statements directed at a specific individual or 
    group of individuals. In New York v. Munn (688 N.Y. S.2d 384; 1999), the court 
    found the defendant guilty of aggravated harassment for posting a message 
    to an Internet newsgroup that instructed people to kill police officers from 
    the NYPD.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; Message boards/guest books: A method of communication similar to a 
    newsgroup in that its contents amount to comments about a particular topic. 
    Internet sites often have guest books where visitors can enter their names 
    and make comments about the site. The visitor&#8217;s name and comments are 
    subsequently available to be viewed by others visiting the Web site. A person 
    who wants to threaten or harass the owner of a Web page easily can leave alarming 
    messages in a guest book.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; Internet sites: A method of communication that involves posting information 
    to a unique uniform resource locator (URL). Internet users later can retrieve 
    this information by directing their Web browser to the corresponding URL. 
    An Internet site becomes the method of harassment when a cyberstalker posts 
    information on a Web page about an individual that causes them to become alarmed 
    or frightened. For example, a cyberstalker could create an Internet site that 
    advertises sexual services for hire and includes the victim&#8217;s picture, 
    phone number, and address. Subsequently, the victim is bombarded with telephone 
    calls or personal visits from individuals inquiring about the advertised sexual 
    services. </p>
  <p align="left">&#8226; Chat rooms: A method of communication that enables real-time 
    text, audio, and video-based group interaction. Chat rooms, or chat channels, 
    usually are organized around specific topics of conversation. Topics include, 
    but are not limited to, such issues as politics, religion, relationships, 
    and sex. When communicating in a chat room, a participant&#8217;s messages 
    are broadcast to everyone signed into the particular chat room. Several types 
    of chat services have emerged since the development of the Internet. Chat 
    services can be public or private. Public chat services are open to everyone 
    with access to the Internet. For example, Internet relay chat (IRC) and I 
    seek you (ICQ) chat are open to all Internet users. Both IRC and ICQ chat 
    rooms have hundreds of chat channels that cover a diverse range of subjects 
    and enable the transfer of files between active participants. Unlike public 
    chat services, private services limit access to their chat channels and are 
    hosted by specific on-line service providers. Chat rooms provide cyberstalkers 
    with different options to harass their victims. A stalker can send alarming 
    messages directly to the victim while conversing in a chat room. The message 
    is delivered to the intended victim, as well as to all those users who currently 
    are logged into the chat room. In addition, the cyberstalker can pose as the 
    victim in a chat room and provide personal information to participants, thereby 
    resulting in the intended victim being directly contacted in person, by e-mail, 
    or by phone.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; Third-party instant messengers: A method of communication that enables 
    real-time text, audio, and videobased interaction between two individuals 
    over the Internet or a computer network. Users program their instant messenger 
    software to notify them when designated individuals log on to the network. 
    With instant messaging software, users have the ability to engage in real-time 
    dialogue with a designated person as long as both parties are connected to 
    the network. Stalkers with prior knowledge of a victim&#8217;s screen name 
    can use an instant messenger to send harassing messages in real time when

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Knowing 
  the type of Internet technology used most often by cyberstalkers can prove beneficial 
  to law enforcement administrators who must decide how to allocate the training

<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">ISSUES 
  FACING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Technical 
  features of the Internet and procedural issues with the law present problems 
  for criminal justice agencies when investigating and prosecuting cyberstalking 
  cases. These problems, however, are not crime specific and generally occur when 
  agencies investigate and prosecute cases involving any type of computer crime.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Jurisdiction</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  global reach of the Internet and the instantaneous nature of</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">computer-mediated 
  communication present law enforcement with jurisdictional issues that could 
  negatively impact the investigation and the subsequent prosecution of computer 
  crimes.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">7</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  With the Internet, stalkers no longer need physical proximity to have contact 
  with their victims. They just as easily can harass a person in another state 
  or country as they can a person who lives in close proximity.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  majority of CITU&#8217;s aggravated harassment cases involved investigations 
  where both the offender and victim resided within the jurisdiction of the NYPD. 
  In approximately 72 percent of the cases, the offender and the victim resided 
  within the five boroughs of New York City. In comparison, 26 percent of the 
  cases involved either an offender or a victim who resided outside the jurisdiction 
  of the NYPD but within the United States, while 2 percent of the cases involved 
  an offender from a foreign country.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">An 
  offender residing outside the jurisdiction of the investigating agency can negatively 
  impact the</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">outcome 
  of a case. In New York City, the District Attorney&#8217;s Office is less inclined 
  to prosecute aggravated harassment cases if the arrest of the suspect requires 
  extradition from another jurisdiction. Such policies have prevented the apprehension 
  of offenders by the NYPD in cases where investigations by CITU have produced 
  evidence supporting their arrests. In 20 aggravated harassment cases investigated 
  by CITU, the NYPD did not arrest the suspects, despite supporting evidence, 
  because their arrests would require extradition from another jurisdiction. In 
  these cases, the NYPD made referrals to the police departments that had jurisdiction 
  over the offenders.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Differences 
  in statutory definitions of stalking across states may complicate the investigation 
  and prosecution processes when offenders reside outside the jurisdiction of 
  the investigating agency. Jurisdictions that do not recognize Internet communication 
  as a viable method to stalk or harass may deny or ignore the extradition request, 
  search warrant, or subpoena of a jurisdiction where</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">such 
  methods do constitute a criminal offense.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">To 
  minimize the negative impact jurisdictional issues have on the successful investigation 
  and prosecution of cyberstalking cases, computer crime investigation units should 
  develop working relationships with their counterparts in other jurisdictions. 
  Such relationships can prove essential to securing the arrest of out-of-state 
  or foreign offenders in their home jurisdictions when the victim&#8217;s jurisdiction 
  will not arrest if extradition is required. In addition, cross-jurisdictional 
  relationships between computer crime investigation units can help secure the 
  execution of out-of-state subpoenas and search warrants and facilitate relationships 
  with out-of-state Internet service providers, computer manufacturers, and software 
  developers. Over the past decade, various professional organizations have formed 
  for those involved with the investigation of computer-related crimes. Participation 
  in these organizations can provide law enforcement with invaluable links to 
  out-of-state resources.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Because 
  of the ease with which cyberstalkers may attack across jurisdictional lines, 
  legislatures should carefully define the venue of the offense. In cases where 
  threatening communication originates from another state or country and the statute 
  of the investigating jurisdiction defines the venue of the offense in terms 
  of where the communication originated, the criminal justice community will not 
  be able to properly serve the victim. When creating legislation to combat</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">cyberstalking 
  or when revising existing stalking legislation to include Internet communication, 
  states should define the venue of the offense in a manner that includes both 
  the place where the communication was received and the place where the communication 
  originated.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Account 
  and User Information</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  unwillingness of some Internet service providers to readily grant law enforcement 
  access to subscriber records further complicates the investigation of a cyberstalking 
  case. Not all Internet service providers agree on what constitutes subscriber 
  records, which are obtainable by subpoena, as opposed to transactional records, 
  which require a search warrant.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">8 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">When 
  compared to obtaining telephone records from a telephone company, obtaining 
  a suspect&#8217;s Internet account information from a service provider can prove 
  far more complicated and involve an increase in the amount of paperwork</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">and time an 
  investigator spends on a case.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Out-of-date 
  and missing account, subscriber, or user information also presents problems 
  to law enforcement agencies when investigating cases of cyberstalking. Without 
  toll records or transactional data, investigators can have a difficult time 
  establishing an electronic link between the suspect and the victim. The financial 
  and human costs associated with gathering and maintaining account information 
  decreases the possibility that Internet service providers will voluntarily collect 
  and maintain such data for a useful period of time. Missing toll records, transactional 
  data, user information, or account content resulted in a negative case clearance 
  in approximately 18 percent of the cyberstalking cases investigated by CITU. 
  In these cases, the content of the communication contained a threatening message, 
  but no arrest occurred because detectives could not gain access to the electronic 
  evidence to legally support apprehending a specific individual. To ensure that 
  account, subscriber, and user information are collected and saved long enough 
  to help law enforcement, legislation that regulates Internet service providers 
  should include data collection requirements.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Anonymizing 
  Tools</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  continued development and increased availability of anonymizing Internet tools 
  (i.e., devices that ensure a person&#8217;s anonymity when using the Internet) 
  can complicate the investigation of cyberstalking cases. Anonymous</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">remailers 
  allow individuals to send electronic mail without transmitting any information 
  that would enable others to determine the identity of the author. Remailers 
  strip identifying information from the e-mail header and erase any transactional 
  data from servers that would enable law enforcement to trace the message back 
  to the author. Consequently, cyberstalkers who use an anonymous remailer as 
  the sole means to send threatening or harassing e-mail messages will remain 
  virtually undetectable to the victim and law enforcement. The danger raised 
  by the use of anonymous remailers, as depicted by CITU&#8217;s caseload, does 
  not stem from the frequency in which these tools are used, but from the effect 
  these tools have on the investigative process. Anonymous remailers were used 
  in only 4, or 2.1 percent, of the 192 cyberstalking cases</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">investigated 
  by CITU. Investigators, however, could not trace the harassing e-mail messages 
  sent through the anonymous remailers back to their authors in all four cases 
  where these tools were used.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Anonymous 
  Web-browsing services also offer cyberstalkers the opportunity to harass or 
  threaten victims while remaining virtually untraceable to law enforcement. Some 
  companies provide users with the ability to surf the Inter-net, participate 
  in public chat channels, send instant messages, and post messages to newsgroups 
  without transmitting any identifying information. The exclusive use of such 
  services to send harassing messages would prevent investigators from establishing 
  an electronic link between the victim and the offender. An examination of CITU&#8217;s 
  cyberstalking caseload found no instances where</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">offenders 
  used anonymous Web-browsing services to stalk their victims.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  widespread availability of anonymizing tools can increase the amount of cyberstalking 
  and Internet deviance in general. Theoretically, deviance will result from the 
  use of anonymizing tools because people will feel less restrained when not faced 
  with the fear of detection by their victim or the police. The absence of a legally 
  binding international body to regulate the Internet leaves little hope that 
  the deployment of anonymizing tools will be stopped. Even if a country did succeed 
  in banning the distribution of anonymizing tools, the global reach of the Internet 
  would enable people to seek out such tools in countries that allow their use. 
  Consequently, citizens must learn to survive on an Internet where people can 
  act without accountability. In the absence of a regulatory solution to safeguard 
  Internet users against those who employ anonymizing tools to harass, Internet 
  service providers and related software companies should seek a technological 
  solution aimed at blocking unwanted anonymous communication.</font> </p>

<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">CONCLUSION</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Because 
  the Internet allows human interaction without physical barriers and with the 
  perception of anonymity, it has become the ideal instrument for individuals 
  who wish to intimidate, threaten, or harass. Federal and state legislation have 
  emerged to criminalize such behavior. Legislatures aiming to criminalize cyberstalking 
  should</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">take 
  an evolutionary approach toward defining the means of communication covered 
  by the law to ensure protection against harassing communications sent using 
  newly developed technologies.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">An 
  examination of all computer crimes investigated by the New York City Police 
  Department from January 1996 through August 2000 found cyberstalking to be the 
  most prevalent computer crime investigated by the department. Thus, police personnel 
  administrating computer crime units should prioritize staffing and training 
  initiatives that properly equip their units to deal with the cyberstalking problem. 
  Additionally, because cyberstalkers use e-mail as the communication method of 
  choice, computer crime unit administrators should prioritize technical training 
  that provides investigators with the knowledge needed to perform e-mail-related 
  forensics.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Out-of-date 
  and missing account, subscriber, and user information, as well as anonymizing 
  tools, presented problems for law enforcement during cyberstalking investigations. 
  Working relationships between computer crime units in all agencies can minimize 
  the negative effects that jurisdictional issues have on the investigation and 
  prosecutorial processes. These relationships can help facilitate the execution 
  of out-of-state subpoenas and search warrants and provide law enforcement with 
  an open door to out-of-state Internet service providers.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Out-of-date 
  and missing account, subscriber, and user information also have prevented law 
  enforcement from establishing an</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">electronic 
  link between the suspect and the victim. To offset this negative effect, legislative 
  action should establish data collection standards for Internet service providers 
  that meet the needs of computer crime investigators.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Finally, 
  the infrequent use of anonymous remailers by cyber-stalkers should not pull 
  attention from the negative effect that these tools can have on the law enforcement 
  process. The increased availability and continued development of anonymizing 
  Internet tools that are easier to use than previous versions likely will increase 
  the use of these options by criminals. When used, anonymous remailers successfully 
  prevented law enforcement from tracing e-mail messages back to the offender. 
  A technological solution aimed at blocking anonymous communication will offset 
  the threat to users posed by anonymous remailers.</font> </p>

  years, an official advertisement in a local newspaper constituted the only police 
  recruitment efforts of the Fulton, New York, Police Department. The simple announcement 
  usually provided a sufficient number of applicants for screening and hiring 
  purposes. However, the department recently encountered a problem&#8212;even though 
  applicants passed the written civil service test, many of them failed the physical 
  agility test.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Background</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Fulton, 
  New York, a small city in the central part of the state, employs 35 sworn officers 
  to serve the community. The Fulton Police Department maintains an active police 
  candidate list for at least 2 years and, often, up to 4 years. But, because 
  of an insufficient number of candidates several years ago, the agency offered 
  the civil service test, the first phase of the testing process, for police officers 
  for the second time in 2 years. In 1996, 144 applicants took the written</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">examination 
  for the police officer position, and, of those, 100 individuals passed. When 
  the department offered the police test again in 1999, 47 applicants took the 
  test and 36 (76 percent) passed.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  next stage in the testing process consists of the physical agility test. The 
  department tests candidates for flexibility, the amount of push-ups and sit-ups 
  performed in a certain time frame, and the completion of a 1.5-mile run. In 
  1999, more than 58 percent of the applicants could not pass the agility test, 
  which left a short list of candidates. After the remaining group completed background 
  investigations and psychological and polygraph testing, seven more applicants 
  were excluded from the list leaving only 12 percent of those who had taken the 
  written test eligible for appointment. The shortage of eligible candidates seriously 
  concerned the department. In particular, candidates did not seem prepared for 
  the agility test. The written examination had not changed significantly in recent 
  years, but neither had the agility standards. To rectify the problem of a seriously 
  short candidate list, the Fulton Police Department announced another written 
  test in 2000 to garner more candidates.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Recruitment</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">For 
  the written test in 2000, the department embarked on a serious recruitment campaign. 
  The department sent posters to area colleges and press releases to local newspapers 
  and radio and television stations. The department highlighted the recruitment 
  drive, as well as the physical standards, on a special page on its Web site. 
  The department&#8217;s officers and their families, as well as the department 
  staff, assisted with the production of a television commercial that aired in 
  the region and drew the most attention. It showcased Fulton and its police department 
  by starting with a community theme, then leading to a police officer talking 
  with a citizen, investigating an accident, and examining crime scene evidence. 
  At the end of the commercial, viewers saw a telephone number and heard a voice 
  that asked them, &#8220;Are you up to the challenge?&#8221; For 2 months, the 
  agency continued a barrage of media releases and aired the television commercial. 
  This proved an unusual recruitment approach in the area, and it drew the attention 
  of all three local network affiliates, which increased publicity even more. 
  During this time, the</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">department 
  made applications available not only through the civil service office during 
  business hours but also from the police department. All of these efforts proved 
  so successful that the department had to use a high school gymnasium as a testing 
  center.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">To 
  help candidates meet the required physical fitness standards, each applicant 
  received a summary of the requirements. Even though the standards constitute 
  a part of the basic application package, the department added emphasis by attaching 
  a simplified chart, which showed applicants what the department would require 
  if they passed the written examination. Candidates received the fitness standards 
  once again prior to agility testing, several weeks before the test. By providing 
  this information to the candidates well in advance, the department hoped that 
  the elimination rate would decrease significantly.</font> </p>

</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  results of candidate testing showed that the department&#8217;s efforts paid 
  off. A record 160 candidates took the written examination and 111 (69 percent) 
  passed. A segment of those applicants with a passing score underwent the physical 
  agility testing. Of that group, 71 percent passed, a 29 percent increase from 
  the previous year. Even though a 7 percent greater failure rate existed with 
  the written examination compared to the previous year&#8217;s exam, the significant 
  increase of those who successfully completed the agility test gave the department 
  a much larger candidate pool. It also validated the recruitment campaign</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">and, particularly, 
  the emphasis on the physical agility component.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">During 
  the written examination in 2000, the department surveyed candidates to elicit 
  responses concerning recruitment efforts. It designed the survey to measure 
  best practices for recruitment, availability of application packages, number 
  of police tests taken, and applicants&#8217; knowledge of physical agility standards. 
  A summary of the survey results indicated that newspaper advertising proved 
  the most prominent medium from which candidates learned about the police test, 
  followed closely by the television advertising. Candidates suggested that newspaper 
  and television were the best mediums to notify them of future tests. The availability 
  of police test packages was important&#8212;45 percent of candidates obtained 
  them from the police station and 33 percent from the personnel office.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  most critical survey question evaluated whether the department delivered the 
  message on agility standards. Surveys asked if candidates knew about the physical 
  agility requirements. An overwhelming 94 percent said that they knew, and 5 
  percent answered that they &#8220;somewhat&#8221; knew about them. Only 1 percent 
  answered &#8220;no.&#8221; The best analysis occurred when top-scoring candidates 
  underwent physical agility testing. At that time, the pass rate for the agility 
  test reached 71 percent, a 13 percent increase from the previous year.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">In 
  New York, the entrance exam is standardized and given on the same day statewide. 
  This allows</font> </p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">applicants 
  to sit for one test and have their scores filed with other jurisdictions in 
  the state. In 2000, 82 percent of the applicants sitting for the Fulton exam 
  tested only for the Fulton Police Department.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Conclusion</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  officer candidate selection process&#8212;from the written test to the agility 
  test, to background investigations, psychological evaluations, and polygraph 
  examinations&#8212;is intensive and expensive. After many applicants failed the 
  physical agility test in 1999, the Fulton Police Department implemented an aggressive 
  recruitment campaign to attract larger numbers of candidates. The department 
  used a variety of resources to recruit local residents and to advise them of 
  required physical fitness levels. As a result, a</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">record 
  number of candidates took the written examination, and the number of applicants 
  who passed the physical agility test increased dramatically from the previous 
  year.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">A 
  recurrent emphasis on fitness throughout the testing process is a message to 
  candidates of the importance of the standards. While some law enforcement administrators 
  might view a high failure rate for physical testing as a problem beyond their 
  control, an intense recruitment program highlighting the minimum requirements 
  is one method to increase results and yield more candidates.</font> </p>

  April 23, 1990, the U. S. Congress signed the Hate Crime Statistics Act into 
  law.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">1</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Previous to this act, hate/bias crimes existed, but were not tracked or focused 
  on as a specific type of crime. For example, Adolf Hitler&#8217;s attempted genocide 
  in the 1930s and 1940s registers as one of the most heinous acts in history 
  and the abomination that all hate/ bias crimes are measured against, but, at 
  the time of its discovery and investigation, no act or specific guideline for 
  investigating and classifying hate/bias crimes existed.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  FBI defines a hate/bias crime as &#8220;a criminal offense committed against 
  a person, property, or society which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the 
  offender&#8217;s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, 
  or ethnicity/ national origin.&#8221;</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">2</font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  Hate/bias crimes destroy communities, as well as hoard resources from law enforcement 
  agencies. Hate/bias crimes tear at the very fabric of American society&#8212;a 
  society based on clear and certain truths intended for all citizens and communities 
  and distinctly stated in the Declaration of Independence. &#8220;We hold these</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">truths to 
  be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their 
  Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, 
  and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221; Law enforcement agencies and officers need 
  to know the issues, guidelines, and action steps that comprise an effective 
  hate/bias crime response and investigation.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">3 
  </font></sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Law 
  enforcement agencies also should ensure that investigators receive training 
  in such critical elements as understanding the role of the investigator, identifying 
  a hate/ bias crime, classifying an offender,</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">interviewing 
  a victim, relating to a community, and prosecuting an offender. When hate/bias 
  crimes occur, they deserve investigators&#8217; timely response, understanding, 
  and vigilance to ensure an accurate and successful investigation. While veteran 
  investigators of hate/bias crimes recognize these basic tenets, they also know 
  the importance of revisiting them periodically to remind law enforcement officers 
  how to handle fragile victims, families, and communities that have been traumatized 
  by the hateful act of a criminal. Furthermore, the events of September 11, 2001, 
  require the law enforcement community to render special attention to these crimes 
  because the hated community was the entire United States and its way of life.</font>

  crime must be caring and compassionate persons. They must tolerate all races, 
  religions, national origins, sexes, sexual orientations, and disabilities to 
  maintain a nonjudgmental attitude throughout an investigation. Investigators 
  must have comprehensive knowledge of the general elements and motivations behind 
  hate/bias crimes. Investigators also need to recognize the potential of such 
  crimes to affect the primary victim, the victim&#8217;s family, other members 
  of the victim&#8217;s group, or the larger community.</font> </p>

  Driving a victim away, even unintentionally, will slow an investigation and 
  cause the victim to feel even more alienated. Responding to a potential hate/bias

  victim and the investigator, but it also can ensure that the search for offenders 
  begins in the right direction.</font> </p>

  A common, but critical, mistake in a hate/bias crime investigation is the misidentification 
  of the crime. Attempting to correct a misidentification with a victim, community, 
  or within a law enforcement agency is time consuming and difficult at best. 
  Officers unsure about identifying a potential hate/bias crime should consult 
  with a supervisor or an expert on the topic. They should use the department 
  chain of command to inform the department of the incident and to update key 
  members throughout the investigation. Questions similar to the following will 
  help investigators identify hate/bias crimes and begin an investigation.</font>

  Offenders</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Equipped 
  with the answers to these questions, investigators should be able to determine 
  if the crime was committed based upon hate or bias and, if so, begin to investigate 
  the motivations of the offender. Hate/bias crimes, offenders, and their motivations 
  all typically fit within five basic classifications.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">1) 
  Thrill seeking: Generally groups of young people, these offenders are motivated 
  by the experiences of psychological or social excitement, mere pleasure, or 
  the gain of bragging rights. Their targets often are unknown outside the groups 
  they represent. Hate/ bias-based graffiti or verbal or physical assault represent 
  offenses of this classification.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  2) Organized: Motivated by the need to express their profound resentment against,</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">for the most 
  part, minority groups, these offenders look for a role model or leader who will 
  organize and encourage them to act. Skinheads and their activities exemplify 
  this classification.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">3) 
  Missionary: Usually identifying with a specific leader or higher power, these 
  offenders seek to rid the world of evil by disposing of the members of an identified 
  and despised group. Those led by Hitler typify this classification.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">4) 
  Reactive: Typically showing a lack of tolerance for individuals of other groups, 
  these offenders protect and defend what belongs to them (a country, community, 
  neighborhood, school, or church) from outsiders. Average citizens defending 
  their race against another race characterize this classification. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">5) 
  Identity</font><b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  </font></b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">conflicted: 
  Motivated by self-hatred or self-protection, these offenders</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">assault 
  targets with whom they share common traits or characteristics. A homosexual 
  person targeting or assaulting other homosexuals epitomizes this classification.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Once 
  a crime has been responded to, recognized as a hate/ bias crime, and classified 
  as such, investigators should conduct a timely and comprehensive follow-up investigation. 
  Knowing and understanding the five typical classifications, as well as remaining 
  aware of meaningful calendar and anniversary dates (e.g., Hitler&#8217;s birthday), 
  key symbols (e.g., tattoos, mantras), or previous patterns of activity significant 
  for these groups and their agendas, can assist in an effective investigation. 
  Investigators must proceed promptly to keep the incident from escalating, apprehend 
  the perpetrator, and diligently process all physical evidence, all while remaining 
  sensitive to the feelings and needs of the victim or surrounding community.</font>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Interviewing 
  Victims</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Hate/bias 
  crimes are uniquely violent and traumatic. Victims of these crimes feel degraded, 
  isolated, frightened, suspicious of others, powerless, and depressed. Some victims 
  experience severe trauma and denial about the incident, and some victims and 
  families may feel emotionally disturbed for extended periods of time. This long-term 
  stress can take a substantial toll on a family and the surrounding community. 
  Effective investigators know and understand these elements of hate/bias crimes.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Responsive 
  and sensitive investigators also understand how important their communication 
  skills are in these cases and that, in many cases, listening is more important 
  than talking.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">When 
  interviewing the victim of a hate/bias crime, investigators must pay attention 
  to the victim&#8217;s state of mind and do everything in their power to gain 
  useful information while creating a nonstressful environment for the victim. 
  Investigators should interview victims in private. This will help calm victims 
  and remove them from any distractions. Investigators who allow a close friend 
  or family member to join the interview will experience calmer victims. These 
  people will provide support, keep the victims focused, and help them relax. 
  However, official statements cannot be made for victims by friends and family, 
  and investigators should make this clear. Some victims also may require, or 
  be more</font> co<font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">mfortable 
  with, an interpreter.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Investigators 
  should ask questions slowly and allow the victim plenty of time to think or 
  recall important details. Some questions will be difficult to ask and answer; 
  therefore, investigators never should become impatient or argumentative with 
  the victim. Investigators need to collect critical information about specific 
  acts or words used by the perpetrator, as well as record and compile anything 
  else that can help establish a motivation of hate or bias. Victims also will 
  need time to vent frustration and display emotions. To help facilitate this, 
  investigators should express a genuine sense of care and concern throughout 
  the investigation. Last, investigators must help victims connect to sources 
  of support in the community. The critical information gathered during these 
  interviews will be advantageous to a thorough and expeditious investigation, 
  the apprehension of perpetrators, the prosecution of the crime,</font> the response 
  to other such crimes, and the prevention of hate/bias<br>
  crimes in the future.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Relating to Communities</b><br>
  Many citizens do not understand hate/bias crime laws, investigation procedures, 
  or the time required to complete a successful<br>
  investigation. Thus, investigators need to work as liaisons between their agency 
  and the community. Educating victims and others about hate/bias crimes should 
  become a priority and coincide with an investigation. Victims and communities<br>
  will then better understand probing and inquisition regarding the incident. 
  Moreover, education could become a valuable investment in future prevention 
  or response to such crimes.</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Investigators 
  can use many tactics to educate, train, and empower communities to fight hate/bias 
  crimes. Establishing and training Neighborhood Watch groups, encouraging community 
  meetings and community problem-solving activities, and supporting community 
  efforts by involving local law enforcement agencies are just a few of the ways 
  investigators can make a good first impression with the community. Investigators 
  also can train targets and victims of hate/bias crimes as responsive and preventive 
  advocates; engage members of local community organizations to help with the 
  response, investigation, and prevention of hate/bias crimes; and help coordinate 
  critical support services for primary and secondary victims. Vigorously responding 
  to and investigating hate/bias crimes in the local community and using</font> 
  <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">the media 
  proactively to inform and educate the community also will generate trust for 
  investigators within a community. On a larger scale, using national resources, 
  programs, and models for prevention, response, and healing will help revive 
  communities.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Working 
  with the families, friends, neighbors, and communities that surround a hate/bias 
  incident becomes as important as working with the victim. Secondary victimization 
  induces blame, outrage, or fear in a family, group of friends, or community. 
  These groups may be motivated to act in response to a hate/bias crime and retaliate 
  in their own ways unless they are educated and provided other options for response 
  or healing. Moreover, no better advocates exist in a community than victims 
  of a hate/bias crime. Training victims and communities to cooperate with law 
  enforcement and other community programs takes the control out of the hands 
  of the perpetrator, instills confidence in the victim and community, and prevents 
  future crimes.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Prosecuting 
  Offenders</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">To 
  instill even more confidence in an affected community, investigators must help 
  with the prosecution of offenders. Keeping the state district attorney&#8217;s 
  office informed and involved is absolutely necessary for effective prosecution 
  of individuals involved in hate/bias crimes. Federal violations will require 
  the involvement of federal agencies. In these cases, establishing rapport with 
  the federal agency assisting in the investigation and</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">with 
  the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office will constitute the correct avenue for investigators. 
  Also pertinent to investigations is the fact that some states do not have hate/bias 
  crime laws. Departments and investigators in these states must be willing to 
  assist the federal agencies and unite with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office to 
  ensure the prosecution of suspects. A working relationship with any state or 
  federal attorney&#8217;s office and its investigators can help develop a joint 
  road map to a successful investigation and prosecution, secure needed search 
  warrants, establish</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">rapport 
  between the victim and the prosecutor, and introduce the victim and community 
  to the inner-workings of the justice system.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  goal of an investigation is to bring the criminal to justice. Prosecution of 
  the perpetrator will help the victim and community bring closure to the horrid 
  events and will bring law enforcement and the community more into harmony, thus 
  creating a safer place for people to live and work.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <b><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Conclusion</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Law 
  enforcement officers who</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">respond 
  to or investigate hate/bias crimes must understand the complexities that define 
  such acts. In turn, they will benefit from informed choices and actions that 
  can help keep or return a community to a safe, secure, and peaceful state. Before 
  the goal of returning a community to normalcy can be achieved, however, investigators 
  have the task of dealing with families, the community, and the local media, 
  in addition to the victim and offender. Furthermore, multiple law enforcement 
  agencies must be included in the investigation to ensure that every logical 
  question is asked and every practical scenario is investigated. Law enforcement 
  agencies and departments that understand the connections between these actions 
  and results will promote the sensitive, timely, and effective response and investigation 
  of hate/bias crimes in their communities.</font> </p>

<p align="left">The Fourth Amendment preserves the &#8220;right of the people to 
  be secure their persons, houses, papers, effects, against unreasonable searches 
  and seizures.&#8221;1 It is well settled that &#8220;searches conducted outside 
  the judicial process, without<br>
  prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth 
  Amendment&#8212;subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated 
  exceptions.&#8221; 2 The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that a search conducted<br>
  pursuant to lawfully given consent is an exception to the warrant and probable 
  cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment.3<br>
</p>
<p align="left">In Schenkloth v. Bustamonte,4 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
  a court reviewing whether an individual voluntarily consented to a search must 
  consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the consent. An individual 
  need not provide written consent for a search of his or her person or property 
  to a law enforcement officer for a consent search to be valid. Even though<br>
  a writing is not legally required, law enforcement officers often will ask an 
  individual for written consent to search to provide evidence of voluntariness. 
</p>
<p align="left">This article considers the particular issues that courts analyze 
  regarding written consent to search. These issues include the evidentiary significance 
  of a written consent to search form, the presentation of a consent to search 
  form to an individual,<br>
  the impact of a person&#8217;s refusal to sign a written consent to search, and 
  the content of consent to search forms. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Evidentiary Significance</b> </p>
<p align="left">The government has the burden of proving that an individual voluntarily 
  consented to a search.5 The presence of a writing reflecting that an individual 
  consented is, therefore, quite significant,6 and evidence that an individual 
  signed a statement of consent to a search has been found to be a clear indication 
  of voluntariness.7 The lack of a writing memorializing a consent to search also 
  may be noted by a court,8 as may the failure of an officer to use an available 
  written consent form.9 One court has stated, &#8220;[o]f course, a written consent 
  to a search is not a legal requirement, but law enforcement officers fail to 
  obtain a written consent when one readily could be obtained at the risk that 
  the government&#8217;s ability to prove the voluntariness of a consent will be 
  seriously compromised.&#8221;10</p>

  Cesar Duran&#8217;s wife, Karen, took a pair of new tennis shoes back to a shoe 
  store to obtain help lacing them. Karen left the shoes with a store employee 
  and went shopping elsewhere in the mall. The store employee discovered three 
  packages of what appeared to be marijuana in the shoes and called the police. 
  The police arrived at the store and determined that the packages did contain 
  marijuana. The police arrested Karen when she returned to the store. The officers 
  also found $3,000, a small amount of cocaine, and drug paraphernalia in her 
  purse. The officers read Karen her </font><i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Miranda</font></i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  warnings and took her to the police station.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">At 
  the police station, Karen told the officers where she lived and admitted that 
  her husband sold large quantities of marijuana in the local area. Karen also 
  signed a form consenting to a search of the Duran residence, an old farmhouse 
  on the property, and several outbuildings. The police arrested Cesar after finding 
  28 pounds of marijuana and a number of weapons during the search.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">In 
  considering Cesar&#8217;s challenge to Karen&#8217;s consent to search, the </font><i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Duran</font></i><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif"> 
  court specifically pointed to the consent form signed by Karen. The court rejected 
  Cesar&#8217;s argument that the fact that this was Karen&#8217;s first arrest 
  should be given weight, noting that the form&#8217;s language stating that she 
  could refuse to consent and that any</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">evidence 
  discovered could be used against her put her on par with an experienced arrestee

  obtained a search warrant to search the defendant&#8217;s residence. Between 
  10 and 15 agents participated in the execution of the warrant, but no evidence 
  was found during the 3-hour search. At the end of the search, an agent asked 
  the defendant about a car parked in front of the house, which the defendant 
  denied owning. He remained silent even when shown a bill of sale for the vehicle 
  with his name on it.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  agent presented a written consent form printed in English for the defendant 
  to sign. The defendant did not speak English, and, therefore, the form had to 
  be translated into Spanish. The agent then proceeded to literally translate 
  the form as he read it to the defendant. Notably, the agent never had obtained 
  a person&#8217;s consent to search in Spanish before, and there were Spanish-speaking 
  officers present at the home who may have done a better job in translating. 
  The defendant agreed to sign the consent form. As the agent filled out the form 
  and the defendant was about to sign it, the &#8220;defendant asked [the agent] 
  &#8216;whether they [agents] were going to search the vehicle anyway,&#8217; to

  determining whether the defendant voluntarily consented to the search, the court 
  considered the defendant&#8217;s age and criminal history and noted that there 
  was no information in the record regarding the defendant&#8217;s education, experience, 
  intelligence, or whether he was mentally deficient. The defendant argued that 
  he was not told that he could refuse consent, while the government stated that 
  the consent to search form signed by the defendant advised him of his right 
  to refuse. The court stated that whether the defendant is informed of the right 
  to refuse consent to search is one factor to be taken into account in determining 
  voluntariness, but indicated that the critical issue to be addressed in this 
  case was the agent&#8217;s ability to accurately translate the consent form.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">The 
  court concluded that the defendant had not voluntarily consented to the search 
  of the vehicle. The court stated that the environment created by the agents 
  in the home at the time the defendant&#8217;s consent was obtained was implicitly 
  coercive. More particularly, the court found it significant that when the agents 
  obtained consent, the defendant was handcuffed, unlawfully seized, separated 
  from the rest of his family while his crying 3-year-old daughter was left alone 
  with one of the 10 to 15 agents in the house, and it was strongly implied that 
  the car would be searched even if he did not consent. At the suppression hearing, 
  the agent was asked to translate the consent form into Spanish as he had on 
  the day in question. The court stated the following with regard to the agent&#8217;s 
  translation: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Assuming 
    that the former translation replicated the latter, we find that defendant 
    was</font> <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">ill-advised 
    of his constitutional rights.... The translation was literal and clumsy, almost 
    awkward sounding. While under more relaxed circumstances it would not be implausible 
    to find that [the agent&#8217;s] translation sufficiently informed defendant 
    about some basic concepts (e.g., his right to refuse consent, his right to 
    consult an attorney), the implicitly coercive environment created by...agents 
    at defendant&#8217;s home precludes such a finding.</font><sup><font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">33</font></sup>

  of carrying counterfeit bills and was asked if he would consent to a search. 
  Boukater then stated, &#8220;It looks like you got me. You can search my bags.&#8221; 
  After refusing to give written consent, he was asked if he was withdrawing his

  an individual&#8217;s consent to search in writing provides substantial evidence 
  that an individual voluntarily consented. However, even though an individual 
  consents to a search in writing, courts still will scrutinize all of the facts

  totality of the circumstances, the consent was voluntary.</font> </p>
<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Officers

  the facts and circumstances under which the consent was given. Officers should 
  pay particular attention to actions and statements made by both the officer

  individual refuses to sign a written consent to search but verbally consents 
  to a search, officers should document meticulously both what the officer said 
  when asking for consent and what the individual said when giving consent.</font>

<p align="left">      <font size="2" face="TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif">Officers
