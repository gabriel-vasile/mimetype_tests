The 17 guys had some sort of a web bag they put the helmets in.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Yeah, we did, too.  We had the helmet bags.  It was like a flying-helmet bag.  And then there was a webbing that we had.  And, I think, it was generally behind the ascent engine cover.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:07:19</b> England: And, Charlie, your cabin ECS looked good.<p><b>126:07:29</b> Young: Okay.  I'm going to have some air in here.<blockquote><i>[John's deflated suit may be pinching him.]</i></blockquote><b>126:07:39</b> Duke: (Garbled) my hand's so tired I can't (unlock my gloves)...  (Long Pause)  John, can you help me?<p><b>126:08:00</b> Young: I think you may have some pressure in the suit there.<p><b>126:08:03</b> Duke: Right.<p><b>126:08:04</b> Young: Let me get this other glove and I'll get it.<p><b>126:08:08</b> Duke: I think my fingers are just tired.  (Long Pause)<p><b>126:08:34</b> Young: (Probably referring to the dust in the cabin) What a mess, Charlie.  (Long Pause)  (Garbled).

Okay. Here, let me do that one.  I can do it, I'll just get this one off to...Okay. Thank you.<p><b>126:09:33</b> Young: Well, look at that, would you.<p><b><a name="1260935">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>( <a href="a16a1260935.mp3" target="new">6 min 45 sec</a> ) <p><b>126:09:35</b> Duke: Boy, mine are tired, too.  I'll tell you.<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was after EVA-1 that we noticed the wrist rings were getting clogged with dust.  There should be some way to cover those wrist rings - the things that snap in and out - to keep them from getting full of dust, because it (meaning the dust) makes them practically impossible to work.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:09:39</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay.  And, it says to &quot;doff helmets with visors;  lower shades;  stow in helmet bag&quot;.  (Long Pause)<blockquote><i>[Now that they have the gloves off, they will doff the helmets.]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;After EVA-1, weexperienced a little stickiness with the helmets.  Not a great deal, so we didn't pay any attention to it.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:10:37</b> Duke: (With his helmet now off) Boy, it feels good to be out of there.  Man.<p><b>126:10:40</b> Young: Hey, that Moon dust don't taste half bad.<p><b>126:10:44</b> Duke: Is that what that is?<p><b>126:10:45</b> Young: Yeah.<p><b>126:10:46</b> Duke: I think it is just the ECS.  (Long Pause)  Whew.<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;This is the first time I've heard anybodycomment on taste, rather than on smell.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;It was a little of both.  To me, it was more of a smell.It had that gunpowder odor to me.  I thought it might have been the ECS,you know, just coming up - with that oxygen in the lines.  But I think it really was the lunar dust.  It had to me a greasy (feel)...It reallymagnified your skin oils.  As you got it on, it felt like it was a realgreasy feeling.  Oily dust.  But what I think it was, it was picking upyour skin oils - because there is no moisture in the stuff.  And it didhave that taste - to me, gunpowder - and a smell ofgunpowder.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:11:03</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  &quot;Stow in the helmet bags.  Verify safety on <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a>.&quot;  All right.<p><b>126:11:12</b> Duke: Get that.<p><b>126:11:15</b> Young: First thing I want...<p><b>126:11:17</b> LM Crew: Is a drink of water.<p><b>126:11:19</b> Young: I'm going to take a break and get me a drink of water.<p><b>126:11:21</b> Duke: (Garbled) I finished mine long ago.  (Pause)<p><b>126:11:30</b> LM Crew: (Garbled)<p><b><a name="1261134">126:11:34</a></b> Young: Yes.  I could have drank all of mine if I had a mouth behind my left ear.  That's my only problem.  It got lodged back there and I could never get at it.  (Long Pause)<p><b>126:12:14</b> Duke: Old TELMU, Tony, should have seen the water quantity go down about 10 percent on that drink.<p><b>126:12:22</b> England: Okay.  We saw it, Charlie.<p><b>126:12:28</b> Duke: Boy, it tasted good.  Okay; &quot;verify safety. Descent H2O valve, Open.  Remove Purge Valve; stow in <a href="../alsj-purse.html" target="new">purse</a>.  Okay; disconnect OPS O2 hose.&quot;  (Pause)<p><b>126:12:47</b> Duke: Have any?<blockquote><i>[Charlie may be asking John if he got anything from the <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">drink bag</a> during the EVA.]</i></blockquote><b>126:12:56</b> Young: That's why you saw me dogging it (meaning &quot;going slow&quot;) out there.  (Long Pause)<p><b>126:13:18</b> Duke: Okay, I'm turning my (PLSS LCG) pump off.  (Garbled) Okay, now I've got to disconnect your O...(Correcting himself) purge valve.<p><b>126:13:32</b> Young: (Have I) still got a purge valve there?<p><b>126:13:34</b> Duke: Yeah, with a connector.  (Pause)<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I had been visualizing just a bare pin falling out on the surface and was amazed that you saw it.  But the fact that's it's got that Red Apple on there means it was real easy to see.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;And it was real easy to get to in an emergency.  Justpull the apple.  It was a biggie.  That's the only reason I saw it: because of the apple.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:13:40</b> Young: Try not to step on that bag.  That one's got to go back to the...Okay.  I can't believe this is so dirty.  (Long Pause)  Ah!<p><b>126:14:01</b> Young: (Laughing)  Well it works good, when you (garbled) get around to it.<blockquote><i>[John has probably gotten his <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">drink valve</a> back into reach and has finally gotten a drink from it.]</i></blockquote><b>126:14:05</b> Young: Well, shoot, Charlie, let me get that thing.  (Garbled) dusty.  (Long Pause)<blockquote><i>[They may have dropped something.]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The first thing thathappened to us that really slowed us down on EVA-1 was that Charlie's tool harness fell off, and we both had PLSSs on.  It was really tough to get the tool harness up off the floor, or off the side and underneath Charlie and put (it) back on with both PLSSs on.  We should be able to belt that tool harness on so it wouldn't fall off until such time as somebody makes a positive motion to get it off.  That's really a drag, that tool harness.  Not only could we never keep it from falling off, but we could never keep it on once we got it put on.  We could never keep it on in the vehicle; we always had to tighten it down.  We tightened it down repeatedly inside thevehicle.  Once we got outside the vehicle, we'd have to tighten it down for the last time.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:14:48</b> Duke: Okay, why don't you turn and face me, and I'll get to your (LM) O2 (hoses connected).  (Garbled)  I've already got mine.<p><b>126:14:57</b> Young: You got yours?<p><b>126:14:58</b> Duke: You know, John, it would be a lot easier if youcould come this way.  There we go.  Uh-oh.<p><b>126:15:06</b> Young: All right, how's that?  That's fine, Charlie.  Ithink that one's (garbled).<p><b>126:15:14</b> Duke: Okay.  And just...I'll read the checklist.&quot;Disconnect OPS O2 hose; connect LM hoses&quot; - funny that we have to do that.  &quot;<a href="../ECSf6GSuitIsolVlv.jpg" title="image" target="new">Suit Isol(ation Valve)</a>, both, Suit Flow; PLSS Pump, Off, and Fan, Off.&quot;<blockquote><i>[Charlie is wondering why they have to connect the LM O2 and H2O hoses when, in about an hour and a half, they will doff the suits.  The only explanation that comes to mind is that there is a concern about them overheating while they do the PLSS O2 recharge, the PLSS/OPS doffing, and other tasks on Surface 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4.]</i></blockquote><b>126:15:26</b> Young: Okay.<p><b>126:15:28</b> Duke: &quot;Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA;  connect LM H2O.&quot;<p><b>126:15:29</b> Young: (Wanting some LM cooling) Now, that's the bestthing we got to do.  (Pause)  Okay, I got a flag, a press flag (asexpected, because his PLSS O2 is off).<p><b>126:15:45</b> Duke: Okay, let me get you your (LM) water (hoses).

Well, I hope.  Okay, Charlie.  I don't knowif I can...I keep hanging up on something back there.  What...<p><b>126:19:00</b> Duke: Watch your hoses.  Let me disconnect these because we don't need those dadgum things around like that.<p><b><a name="1261913">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>( <a href="a16a1261913.mp3" target="new">11 min 24 sec</a> ) <p><b>126:19:13</b> Duke: Okay;  now can you spin around there?<p><b>126:19:15</b> Young: Yeah.  Here comes all our checklists and cards.<p><b>126:19:18</b> Duke: Okay.<p><b><a name="1261920">126:19:20</a></b> Young: (We) may need that one; it might be an APS card.  (Pause)<blockquote><i>[APS is Ascent Propulsion System, which they will use forthe return to orbit.]<p>[I mentioned to Charlie that it was very unusual for the crew to betransmitting during this part of the mission.  He noted that, on Surface3-2, they should have gone to &quot;Mode - ICS/PTT&quot;.  John did, indeed read that step out at <a href="#1261814" target="new">126:18:14</a>.]<p>[Duke - &quot;ICS:PTT.  That meant, to transmit, you had to use thetrigger, but we could talk between ourselves in that position.  Like youcould have an intercom.  So, maybe we had the tape recorder running.  Idon't know how this got out, actually.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Well, Ed comes on here in a little bit and says you arehot-miked.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Well, then John didn't put the switch where it wassupposed to be - or I didn't.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;I was also curious about the 'cards' comment here at <a href="#1261920" target="new">126:19:20</a>.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Oh.  Well, he was going through this folderhere.&quot;]<p>[Charlie had a bag with him at the 1992 mission review; it was made of the same Beta-cloth material as the SCBs.]<p>[Duke - &quot;This is the one we had on board, and we had all ourcards in here; and, so, he was going through 'em and one of 'em he justhappened to pull out was the APS Card.  He was looking for something else.  See, here comes all the checklists and cards and he pulled out one, 'Okay, we're going to need that one.'  And that might have been the APS Burn card and that was something we were going to use later.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Would you have put the Lunar Surface Checklist inthere?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;I don't remember.  Could have.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;And that bag was just basically to keep everythingtogether and out of the way.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  And it was a transfer bag.  We brought everythingover (into the LM); this was all in the Command Module.  So we brought allthat stuff over and, then, we Velcroed up what weneeded.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:19:29</b> Duke: Okay.  Can you turn...The other...<p><b>126:19:33</b> Young: Which way, Charlie?<p><b>126:19:35</b> Duke: Well, your hoses are coming from this side, so...You got to get to that valve behind you.  (Pause)  There you go.<p><b>126:19:47</b> Young: That's the valve I got to get to, it's behind me,Charlie.  (Laughs)<p><b>126:19:51</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;PLSS Mode (AR)&quot;...Houston, how do you read?  Over.<p><b>126:20:03</b> Young: Turn sideways, Charlie, and let me get you some oxygen.<p><b>126:20:10</b> Duke: We are still in Down-Voice Backup, (so) we should be hot miked.<p><b>126:20:14</b> Young: That's what I figured.<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;You were in down-voice backup because of the lack of steerable (antenna) and that wasn't push-to-talk.  Is thatright?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Right.  It gave you a hot-mike.&quot;]<p>[Charlie then looked at the 2 Comm diagram in the Apollo 16 &amp; 17LM Systems Data Book.]<p>[Duke - &quot;Looks like it goes right...(pause, looking at systemdiagrams)  It goes to the speech processor and right on out to theamplifiers.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Without going through the triggers.&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Yeah.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Although there are other instances of down-voice backupin other missions and I imagine that I'll find they are not push-to-talkeither.  That'd be easy enough to check.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:20:15</b> Duke: Houston, how do you read?  Over.<blockquote><i>[Ed Mitchell, the Apollo 14 Lunar Module Pilot, takes overas CapCom.

(Cackling)<p><b>126:20:51</b> Duke: They think I'm you!<p><b>126:20:54</b> Young: Okay, that's got it.  Okay, now.  Do you want...<p><b>126:20:58</b> Duke: Okay, I don't have a watch.  Here, wait a minute; yeah, I do, too.  Okay, go ahead; I'll start a mark.<p><b>126:21:06</b> Young: (Trying to reach the fill valve) (Garbled) I can'tmake it.  Wait a minute, Charlie, don't move.  PLSS Fill (valve) going toFill.  Oh, listen to that old oxygen run in there.<p><b>126:21:21</b> Duke: You got it open?<p><b>126:21:22</b> Young: Yeah, can't you tell?<p><b>126:21:23</b> Duke: No.<p><b>126:21:24</b> Young: You don't hear nothing?<p><b>126:21:25</b> Duke: Uh-uh.<p><b>126:21:26</b> Young: Poor fellow.  You better get your hearing checked.<p><b>126:21:28</b> Duke: You sure that's open?<p><b>126:21:30</b> Young: Yeah!  Just about ran out of oxygen, too, while you were at it, didn't you?  Hey, Houston, can you give us a mark at the end of 4 minutes?<p><b>126:21:39</b> Mitchell: Roger.  Starting now.<p><b>126:21:42</b> Young: You're already...(Hearing Ed)  Okay.<p><b>126:21:46</b> Duke: That Ed Mitchell?<p><b>126:21:47</b> Young: Yep.  That you, Ed?<p><b>126:21:49</b> Mitchell: That's affirm.  Tony has been here for 7 hours or so; he went to check out.<p><b>126:22:00</b> Duke: Oh.  How's everything going?<p><b>126:22:03</b> Mitchell: Real great.  Did a fine job.<p><b>126:22:07</b> Young: That's good.  It's a lot of fun, I'll tell youthat.  By gosh, if it isn't.<p><b>126:22:13</b> Mitchell: You bet your life.  (Pause)  Just take her easy there and catch your breath;  and I'll let you know when 4 minutes isup.<p><b>126:22:31</b> Young: That's what we're doing.  (Pause)<p><b>126:22:45</b> Mitchell: Surprisingly enough, John, we have better comm now than before you went out, on the LM.<p><b>126:22:53</b> Young: I don't understand that.  They must have a big dish still up.<blockquote><i>[Apollo 16 was launched at 17:54 hours Greenwich Mean Time, April 16, 1972; and it is currently 00:17 hours GMT, April 22.  It is just about sunset in Houston and communications from the LM and Command Module are being received through the NASA station at Goldstone California.  There are both 85-foot and 210-foot antennas available at Goldstone and John is speculating that the 210-foot dish is in use.]<p>[Duke - &quot;We had three 210s.  There was one at Madrid and one inAustralia, too.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>126:23:00</b> Duke: Hey, Ed, it's really a spectacular place.  And Iknow why you were so excited at Fra Mauro.<p><b>126:23:05</b> Mitchell: Roger, Roger, Charlie.<p><b>126:23:06</b> Duke: Boy, that is a...<p><b>126:23:07</b> Mitchell: And our comm is better because we have the 210 up now.<p><b>126:23:12</b> Young: Yeah.<p><b>126:23:15</b> Duke: How long we gonna have that beauty?  (No answer; Long Pause)<p><b>126:23:32</b> Mitchell: We'll only have it for a few hours here, butwe're hoping to have it for a good portion of the other EVAs, but I don'thave the exact numbers yet.<p><b>126:23:44</b> Duke: Thanks, Ed.  (Pause)<blockquote><i>[The following exchange between John and Ed is probably a private joke.]</i></blockquote><b>126:23:50</b> Young: Hey, Ed; you're right; it was almost do-able.<p><b>126:23:57</b> Mitchell: Pretty close to the margin there, John.<p><b>126:23:59</b> Young: We only had a 100...(Stops to listen) Yeah, we only had 110 percent this time.<p><b>126:24:05</b> Mitchell: You're right.  And belay my last (transmission).  I don't guess we'll have that large antenna.<p><b>126:24:17</b> Duke: That's okay.<p><b>126:24:20</b> Mitchell: Well, the comm during the EVA wasmagnificent.<p><b>126:24:23</b> Duke: I guess for you guys the...(Stops to listen)<p><b>126:24:25</b> Young: Was it good, huh?<p><b>126:24:26</b> Mitchell: Yeah, really great.<p><b>126:24:30</b> Duke: Ed, you guys have been loud and clear to us every time on your uplink, regardless of the dish.<p><b>126:24:40</b> Young: That's right.<p><b>126:24:41</b> Duke: Sorry we're so bad to you.<blockquote><i>[Houston can be heard easily because there are large dishes and plenty of power available at the three tracking sites:  Goldstone, Honeysuckle Creek, and Madrid.  Conversely, the LM has only a modest amount of energy available and, because of the LM high-gain antenna malfunction, only the omni antennas are usable.]</i></blockquote><b>126:24:47</b> Mitchell: Okay.

So that would make it about 44 pounds.  (Pause)  I bet the &quot;Muley Special&quot; down there will double your weight.<p><b><a name="1271640">127:16:40</a></b> Young: I'm sure it will.  (Joking) It gave Charlie a hernia.  (Long Pause)<blockquote><i>[Big Muley is sample 61016 ( <a href="ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new">175k</a> ) and weighs 11.7 kg or 25.7 terrestrial pounds.  Its lunar weight is 4.3 pounds.]<p>[When Charlie collected the rock at <a href="a16.sta1.html#1240829"target="new">124:08:29</a>, he immediately associated it with BillMuehlberger when he said, &quot;If I fall into Plum Crater getting this rock, Muehlberger has had it.&quot;  Later, when he was back at the LM at<a href="a16.clsout1.html#1252409" target="new">125:24:09</a> during the closeout, he referred to the sample in the following way: &quot;And I got a great big rock: a muley.&quot; A little while later, at <a href="a16.clsout1.html#1252453" target="new">125:24:53</a>, he referred to it as &quot;that rock we picked up (next to the Rover at Station 1), the big - the muley...&quot;.  In 1996, I asked Tony if, prior to the mission, Bill Muehlberger was known as &quot;Muley&quot; and, if not, whether the double meaning of &quot;Muley&quot;  - referring to Muehlberger and to the size of the rock - was obvious at the time.]<p>[England, from a 1996 letter - &quot;I never heard anyone call Bill M.'Muley', but I was aware that it referred to him.  Charlie played with words a lot so he probably invented the association with the rock on the spot.  We would have all understood it.  Bill is not only big, but he is a little stubborn.  The 'Muley' played on his name, his size, and, just a little, on his being stubborn.  Of course, I'd never say that when I was within Bill's reach.&quot;]<p>[Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter - &quot;My nickname in college was'Mully' - short version of Mull-(as it is pronounced)-berger. There weretimes when 'Mule-y' was also used! So, with <a href="../lee_silver.html" target="new">Lee Silver</a> and Dallas Peck, both part of my team, always around and also college friends using that nickname, it became my nickname for all.  I guess it was a short step for the crew to bless the largest rock - I was 210 lbs and 6'1 - 'Big Muley'.&quot;]<p>[Readers should also note that when Ed Mitchell serves as CapCom afterEVA-2, he refers to the rock as &quot;Mully&quot; at <a href="a16.eva2post.html#1510914" target="new">151:09:14</a>, a clear indication that he knows it was named for BillMuehlberger.]</i></blockquote><b>127:17:09</b> England: Okay, and that SCB-5 we'd just like you to stow behind the engine cover, if you can still get to it behind the suits there. We can't give you a permanent location, because we don't have the c.g. (center of gravity) yet, without the rest of the rocks.<p><b>127:17:24</b> Young: Understand.

(Long Pause)<p><b>127:26:06</b> Duke: In fact, Tony, I think this high-pitched hum is how the (ECS suit) loop should sound, if I remember our (vacuum) chamber test.  This is exactly what it sounds like, and it hadn't been doing that (up to this point in the mission).<p><b><a name="1272617">127:26:17</a></b> England: Okay.  Very good.  (Pause)  You're trying to tell us you don't know what normal sounds like.<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break]<p>[Jones - &quot;Did you do very many vacuum chamber tests?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Yeah; we did two or three, if I remember.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Full up?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Yeah, we had our suits on a couple of times.  We did one or two at the Cape and, if I remember, one up at (Grumman, Bethpage) before they shipped it (meaning the LM) down (to the Cape).&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;How much of the operation did you do?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;It was cabin operation.  We didn't do any of this stuff.We just sat there and flipped switches.  They had test procedures that we followed, so you just flipped switches as you listened to the test director.  They had various things they wanted to do in the loops.  So we got on board just to get familiar with the machine and how it works in a vacuum.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;So, other than yourselves and the suits, you didn'thave much in there.  Did you go through a number of other types of tests with the LM fully equipped where you went through these routines?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Not in the chamber, nor in the actual spacecraft.  Wedid it in the <a href="../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new">simulator</a>.  We had a simulator - which was not the real simulator that we flew in to learn the flight procedures - but let's call it an EVA procedures simulator.  It was just a mock-up.  It had an oxygen system and it had a little comm, I think, and then the stowage was right.  And so we'd go through the <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">donning and doffing</a> exercises in real time.  I don't now how many times we did it, but a bunch.  Most of these procedures we had committed to memory, but we followed the checklist.  We'd done it a lot of times.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Those would be the training exercises where the PLSSs were heavier...&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;They were lightweight ones but they were still heavy.  I think they were maybe like ninety pounds, or maybe it was lighter than that; but it was still heavy compared to what we had up on the Moon.  And it was in our regular training suits.  So it was an actual spacesuit and there were gloves and all that stuff.  And the connectors were real connectors.  I guess they had a lighter weight PLSS; they didn't have all the stuff in it.  And we would change out batteries and LiOH canisters and charge 'em - or simulate charging them.  It was real good training.&quot;]<p>[Jones - &quot;Was it a Comedy of Errors the first few times through it?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  You know, just rattling around in there like a bull in a china shop.  And, you know, it never got any fun...I mean, we got better at it, of course.  But it was always a pain in the rear; you just hated doing it because it was so hard, and you got hot and cooling wasn't right.  But we knew we had to do it to learn it.  So we did it.&quot;]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Every time we took the suit off...It's real handy that the thing (meaning the suit) is standing up by itself in one-sixth gravity.  It's really handy for you to close the zipper up to lube the pressure zipper and get those connectors (clean) before you put the thing away for the night  On the second and third EVA, because everything was really getting dirty - and I don't know whether it's a real problem of not, or an imaginary problem - we were really getting concerned about whether we were going to be able to do things like fasten the connectors.  So we were taking special care to lube everything and,therefore, we ran out of lube.&quot;]<p>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;We had one (container of lube) left for the zipper on EVA-3.&quot;]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I think you shouldhave some more lube in case you do get to a situation where, as you're doing your last donning, something is not working right and you need to go back and lube it again to make sure.&quot;]<p>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Not only did we use the lube, but we used water and the towels to wipe around the outside of the connectors.  And the wrist rings.  It wasn't the O-ring part that was so stiff; it was the mating surface between the suit and the sliding ring.&quot;]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes.  That's been remarked on before.  Somebody said they taped their wrist ring; but that seems to be like a kluge.  I think they should come up with something that keeps the dust out of the wrist ring.  Maybe an overflap that you Velcro on the other side of it to keep the dust out of there, because I just don't think you should have a problem donning and doffing.  We really got a lot of dust; and I don't see really any way out of it when you're holding a (sample) bag and Charlie's dumping dirt in there.  The dust goes all over the place and it's just as easy for it to go down your shirtsleeve as not.  The fact is, we had both dirt and rocks underneath the flap that you raiseto get the glove open.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b><a name="1274300">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>( <a href="a16a1274300.mp3" target="new">0 min 33 sec</a> ) <p><blockquote><i>[Readers should note that the times used at this point in the Journal differ from the GET being used in Houston because of an 11 minute 48 second update made to the clocks in Houston at <a href="a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new">118:06:31</a>.]</i></blockquote><b><a name="1274420">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>( <a href="a16a1274420.mp3" target="new">1 min 24 sec</a> )<blockquote><i>[John's next transmission comes when he reaches the bottom of the second paragraph at the top of Surface 3-5.

Both John and Charlie sound like they've got clogged sinuses.]<p>[Jones - &quot;Jack had a bad allergic reaction to the dust, at leastafter their first EVA.  Did you?&quot;]<p>[Duke - &quot;No. Uh-uh.  I read your comment here on the next page, 'Sounds like clogged sinuses.'  That's true.  Sinuses just don't drain well, up there, because of the low gravity.  And, in zero-gravity, it seemed like you didn't drain at all.  Plus, the low pressure gave you this nasally sound in your voice, (you see)?  And it felt like, a lot of times...You know, the sinuses were all full.  Then I think I had a little twang in my voice from the five-and-a-half psi versus the fourteen-and-a-half we're speaking at now.  So, occasionally you'd feel like you had a squeaky voice.&quot;]<p>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;As we said before, we lubricated the zipper when we got the PGA off; and then fastened the zipper and pulled the seals down tight.  When we took the suits off, they were all covered with dust, up to our knees, even though we kicked our boots off (that is, stamped them on the ladder to knock dust off) as we came up the ladder.  We took the suits off and put them into a <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jettison bag</a>, pulled the jettison bag up over the legs, and laid them on the couch (meaning the ascent engine cover) like everybody else has done.  We put a bag down onthe floor to stand on, but that did not keep us from getting dust all over the place.  One of the problems was that we had dust on the bottom of the PLSSs even though we wiped them off, and dust on the side of the OPSs for some reason.  They were lying on the floor.  As a result, when we got into our LCGs (John probably means CWG - Constant Wear Garment - rather than LCG), we were sort of standing around...Like, I had one foot on an OPS and one foot on the <a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new">midstep</a> and was sort of leaning back against the shelf on my side.  Charlie was sort of standing with his foot on the ETB and one foot on the midstep, and we were up out of the dirt.  Our hands were blackwhen we started taking each other's wrist rings off.  We got our hands dirty and I didn't get the dirt off my hands until after we'd landed (on Earth at the end of the mission).  Washed them up good.  I don't think Charlie did (get his hands clean), either.  We managed to get dirt on the bottom of the LCGs, on our sleeves, and on our hands (and all of) that got into the suits.  It was just a little dust.  I don't know what problem it entailed, but it sure looked like it might become a problem.  The only thing I can say is we stayed out of the dirt as best we could.  It was all over the floor.  Just (not) hardly any way to get out of it.  We even had some on the midstep where we'd laid the ETB up there.  It was dust covered, too, from dropping in the dirt because the LEC was too long to keep it off the ground.&quot;]<p>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Another eight ounces on the stowage list in the form of a <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a> would be an outstanding addition to the LM stowage.&quot;]</i></blockquote><HR><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ><TR align=center><TD><A HREF="../frame.html" target="_parent">Journal Home Page</A> </TD><TD><A HREF="a16j.html">Apollo 16 Journal Index</A> </TD><TD><a href="a16.debrief1.html">Debrief and Goodnight</a></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- 508 TEAM 2001 --></body></html>
