<p>		(Exhibit A)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.	Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have
represented, expressly or by implication, that users of the Cross
Walk Treadmill will burn calories at a rate of up to 1,100 per
hour under conditions of ordinary use.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		

<p>8.	Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have
represented, expressly or by implication, that they possessed and
relied upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the
representation set forth in Paragraph 7, at the time the
representation was made.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>9.	In truth and in fact, respondents did not possess and rely
upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the representation set
forth in Paragraph 7, at the time the representation was made. 
Respondents obtained the 1,100 calorie figure from a study that
measured the rate of calorie burn of persons who had exercised to
the point of exhaustion.  Such &quot;maximal exertion&quot; tests are not
appropriate measures of the number of calories people can burn
during ordinary exercise because they measure calorie burn at a
level of exercise intensity that is unsustainable for more than
an extremely short period of time.  Therefore, the representation
set forth in Paragraph 8 was, and is, false or misleading. 		

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		

<p>10.	Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have
represented, expressly or by implication, that testimonials from
consumers appearing in advertisements for the Cross Walk
Treadmill reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members
of the public who use the product.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>11.	Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have

<p>12.	In truth and in fact, respondents did not possess and rely
upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the representation set
forth in Paragraph 10, at the time the representation was made. 
Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 11 was, and
is, false or misleading.

<p>13.	The acts and practices of respondents as alleged in this
complaint constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or
affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act.

probably surprise you as much as it did me.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Did you know that the latest research shows
that <u>walking</u> is the <u>most efficient method for
burning fat calories and losing weight?</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		It's true.  And to take advantage of that
fact... plus all the benefits of total body
fitness... nothing works like the Proform
Crosswalk.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		In fact, it's been such a phenomenal success, that
now Proform has created two <u>new</u> Crosswalk models,

<p>		No pain, no gain.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>MARTY</center>


<p>		Exactly.  But, the latest research shows
something very different: That a consistent,
<u>moderately intense</u> workout is actually the
best method for burning fat calories and
losing weight.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>MARTY</center>


<p>		That is such an important question and the
answer is yes, because only a motorized
treadmill will keep you at a consistent pace,
within a comfortable fat burning zone.  In
fact, the Crosswalk burns over 20% <u>more fat
calories</u> than a manual treadmill.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>BILL</center>


<p>		Unlike regular walking, or regular
treadmills, the Crosswalk gives you quicker
results, and overall better muscle toning,
because the resistance arms involve your
upper body, as well.

<p>		{If your goal is to lose weight, you have to
do more than just diet.  While dieting does
reduce your caloric intake, it also lowers
your metabolism.  And it's been proven that a
low metabolism won't burn off your excess
fat.  So to achieve that desired high fat
burning metabolism, I recommend regular,
brisk exercise at a constant pace, a pace
that raises your heart rate, or pulse, up to
your target heart rate zone, for optimum fat
burning.  Recent studies have shown that
walking is one of the best ways to accomplish
this.  However, you must walk a steady rate. 
One way to do that is to walk on a motorized
treadmill.  This keeps you walking at a
constant pace which gives you the most
benefit from your exercise.}

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>TOM</center>


<p>		Speaking of which, I heard you say
something earlier about the Crosswalks
being better than manual treadmills,
because the Crosswalk is motorized.  I'll
tell you, there's a lot of people out
there pushing manuals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>BILL</center>


<p>		&quot;Pushing&quot; is exactly the right word. 
Because if you've ever tried to use one
that's what you're doing.  And they're
cheaper to build. And if they were
effective we'd build one ourselves.  But,
let me show you something.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>BILL</center>


<p><center>[voiceover]</center>


<p>		Okay, here we go.  Most manual treadmills are
set at a 12% incline.  That's pretty steep.  But
manuals <u>have</u> to be set that way because they
depend on your body weight and on gravity to
work.  When they're level, you just can't get
them to go.                    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>{Depiction of chart showing target heart rate zone during 20 minute
workout using a manual treadmill}

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		That means you have to over-exert.... and you
get tired and slow down, the manual tread slows
down, too.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>{Depiction of chart showing target heart rate zone during 20

<p>minute workout using a manual treadmill and using a CrossWalk}

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Between pushing too hard... and not hard
enough... you're not maintaining that
consistency to stay within your fat burning
zone.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		And remember, the key to successful weight loss
is <u>consistent, moderate</u> exercise within your fat
burning zone.  Now, that's why the Crosswalk's
motorized tread is so much more efficient.  You
can set a pace, and maintain it.  In fact, a
recent university study showed you can lose <u>over
20% more fat</u> <u>calories</u> on the Crosswalk than
working out on a manual treadmill.

Crosswalks so much better than stair steppers and
bikes?

total body workout.  And the same can be said
for most manual treadmills.

<p>		Walking is something that almost everyone
can do--I know I enjoy going for walks in
my neighborhood.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		But I also know that I'd never stick with
my fitness program if I didn't have my
Crosswalk at home.                         


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		For one thing, I don't know about your
climate, but where I live the weather is
never a sure thing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		It's also nice to have the security of
staying at home to exercise.  With the
Crosswalk, I can walk after dark, or at
times when I might not feel as comfortable
going out.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		I'm a mother, too.  And there are lots of
times when leaving the house just isn't
practical.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>{SUPER: BURN FAT}

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

versatile.  You can burn fat.

<p>		Those are just a few of the Crosswalk's
advantages.  And there's lots more to
come.  So stay tuned for the next chapter

<p>		{I can't emphasize enough that study after
study has demonstrated that to lose weight
you have to burn more calories than you
take in.  And the more muscles you use
during your workout the more calories
you'll burn in the shortest period of
time.  Using a motorized treadmill with
resistance arms lets you work all the
large muscle groups in both your upper and
lower body.  This gives you the maximum
calories burn, plus the added benefits of

under conditions of ordinary use.  The complaint notes that
respondents obtained the 1,100 calorie figure from a study that
measured the rate of calorie burn of persons who had exercised to
the point of exhaustion.  The complaint alleges that such
&quot;maximal exertion&quot; tests are not appropriate measures of the
number of calories people can burn during ordinary exercise
because they measure calorie burn at a level of exercise
intensity that is unsustainable for more than an extremely short
period of time.  The Commission's complaint also charges that the
respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim
that weight loss testimonials from consumers appearing in
advertisements for the treadmill reflect the typical or ordinary
experience of members of the public who use the product.

<p>	The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to
remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from
engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.	Part I of
the proposed order would prohibit respondents from making any
claim for the &quot;Cross Walk Treadmill,&quot; or for any other exercise
equipment: (1) about the relative, comparative, or absolute rate
at which users burn calories, or the number of calories users
burn, through use of such product; (2) about the relative,
comparative, or absolute weight loss users achieve through use of
such product; (3) about the relative, comparative, or absolute
amount of fat or fat calories users burn through use of such
product; or (4) about the benefits, performance, or efficacy of
any such product with respect to calorie burning, fat burning, or
weight loss; unless, at the time such a claim is made,
respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable
scientific evidence, that substantiates the claim.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Part II of the proposed order addresses claims made through
endorsements or testimonials.  Under Part II, respondents may
make such representations if they possess and rely upon competent
and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the
representations; or respondents must disclose either what the
generally expected results would be for users of the advertised
product, or the limited applicability of the endorser's
experience to what consumers may generally expect to achieve. 
The proposed order's treatment of testimonial claims is in
accordance with the Commission's &quot;Guides Concerning Use of
Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising,&quot; 16 C.F.R. 255.2
(a).  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The remaining provisions of the proposed order relate to
respondents' obligation to make available to the Commission
materials substantiating claims covered by the order; to notify
the Commission of changes in the corporations' structure; to
provide copies of the order to certain personnel of the
corporations; and to file compliance reports with the Commission. 
The order also provides that the order will terminate after
twenty years under certain circumstances.

<p>	The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment
on the proposed order.  It is not intended to constitute an
official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to
modify in any way their terms.
