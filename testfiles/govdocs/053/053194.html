<P ALIGN="justify">Greenwater Valley was the site of the most
spectacular boom in the history of Death Valley mining. While other
districts, such as Bullfrog, Lee-Echo, Panamint, Skidoo and Leadfield
had their booms, which saw rushes into new mining areas and the
establishment of new mining camps and towns, Greenwater surpassed all
the others in the brilliance of its birth. Within a year and a half from
the beginning of the rush to Greenwater, the deserted desert was home to
over two thousand inhabitants in four towns, seventy-three incorporated
mining companies, and was the focal point of over 140 million dollars
worth of capitalization.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But it was not only the amazing rush to Greenwater
which sets it apart from other booms, for Greenwater also experienced
the shortest life ever recorded for a boom camp of its size. Within one
year from the height of the boom, all but five of the companies had left
the district, and Greenwater was practically deserted. By the end of two
more years, everyone had given up, and the Greenwater Valley, the scene
of so much bustle and excitement a short time before, was once again
completely deserted. This combination of a tremendous boom, a brief life
and then complete desertion, all within the space of less than four
years, has made Greenwater a name which is still anathema to the
investing public, and dear to the hearts of desert folklorists. Few, if
any, mining camps in the American west have ever combined such initial
excitement with such total disappointment.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Inevitably, considering the popular place of
Greenwater in the annals of western folklore, it is sometimes difficult
to separate the fact from the fiction surrounding the history of the
district--and there is no lack of either. Although the argument about
who really discovered Greenwater started as early as 1906 and has
continued ever since, it seems apparent that the honor must be divided.
Some prospectors later claimed that they had made copper locations in
Greenwater Valley as early as the late 1890s, but  the obvious
difficulties inherent in mining copper in an isolated spot caused such
locations, if made, to be abandoned.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The real discovery of Greenwater, as with most
throughout the Death Valley area, came about as a result of the Bullfrog
boom, sixty-five miles to the north. As noted before, the great rush to
the Bullfrog Hills soon filled up the ground in that vicinity with
location notices, and late-arriving prospectors were forced to move
farther afield. Two such men, Fred Birney and Phil Creasor, ambled south
down the east side of the Black Mountain Range, and in February of 1905,
while looking for gold, uncovered rich surface croppings of an immense
copper belt in Greenwater Valley. Birney and Creasor sent samples of
their find to Patsy Clark of Spokane, a well-known copper mining
operator, and Clark was sufficiently impressed to buy the claims from
the two men in May.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Hearing of Clark's new holdings, which held amazingly
high copper values at the surface, F. August Heinze, the "famous copper
king" of Butte, Montana, also visited the new locations, and was equally
impressed. The rich surface showing was so promising that Heinze and his
partners immediately bought sixteen copper claims from another pair of
early prospectors for the neat sum of $275,000. Commenting upon the
transaction, which brought newspaper attention to the area, the <U>Inyo
Independent</U> reported that the "vast copper deposits in the Funeral
[sic] range have long been known to prospectors, but their
inaccessability to the markets prevented working." Now, with the booming
camp of Bullfrog to the north, and the promise of railroads into the
desert regions, the transportation and supply problems would be much
less severe, although the Greenwater Valley was still a long way from
civilization.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the news quickly spread that two of copper's
biggest operators had located in Greenwater, a mile rush ensued.
Prospectors and mining men started to flock into the Greenwater area in
order to stake out close-in ground. As usual with a new boom,
transportation problems exceeded all others, and many prospectors,
including one who reported for the <U>Inyo Independent</U> were reduced
to walking from Bullfrog into the new district, a task which took three
days. The work was rough, since even in September the thermometer
reached 113 degrees in the afternoon, and the reporter-prospector found
that he was forced to sit down and rest after building each monument to
mark his claims. The heat was not alleviated by the total lack of water
in the district, and prospectors who ran out of water were forced to
leave their location work and return to Bullfrog, the nearest point of
civilization. [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#1">1</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By late June of 1905, Patsy Clark already had eight
men working at his property, and a shaft had been sunk thirty-five feet
into the ground. As the year progressed, other operators entered the
scene, including Arthur Kunze, who secured some of the best looking
ground in the area and had five men working it by the end of the year.
As 1906 opened, Kunze, Clark and Heinze began to have plenty of company,
for innumerable other mining promoters, prospectors and miners were
entering the district. Clark established a mining camp near his mine to
support his operation, and other small camps sprung up along the valley
floor as mires began to open almost daily.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the rush to the area continued, however, it soon
became apparent that the lack of an adequate water supply anywhere in
the vicinity would be a major problem. "The water proposition is the
serious drawback in that section at present, and will be a matter of
considerable expense," remarked a Rhyolite stock broker, "yet the
earmarks of the country seem to show that any expense would be
justified, judging from the surface indications." Those surface
indications were were indeed so rich that men and money continued to
rush into the district, regardless of the serious problems of water and
transportation. As the spring progressed, some of the biggest names in
Nevada mining joined the boom, and fortunes reaped in Tonopah and
Goldfield were reinvested in the promising new district.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">"All of the great copper magnates are looking to this
section," reported the <U>Inyo Register</U> in May, "which is destined
to become the next great copper district of the world." That prediction
seemed to be borne out by June of 1906, as the copper belt was "proven"
to be at least seven miles long. Four of the larger mines had by now
been incorporated into full-fledged mining companies, and Greenwater
seemed assured of a long and lively life.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The rush slowed down somewhat during the hot summer
months of 1906, although the future of the district looked even better
when both the Las Vegas &amp; Tonopah and the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater
Railroads, which were building into the Bullfrog District, expressed
interest in tapping the new copper belt into the south. The local papers
declared that the district "will make one of the greatest copper camps
in America," and the continuing rush caused the major national mining
journals to take notice of the area. "The weather in Death Valley is the
only thing that prevents Greenwater from having one of the biggest booms
on record in this country," wrote the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U>. "But even
the midsummer heat of the "terrible region" does not keep prospectors
out. Hardly a day passes that Bullfrog prospectors are not seen starting
out for Greenwater." in early July, a stage line was started from Ash
Meadows into the new district, and water, which was being hauled in from
fifteen miles away, was selling for $5 per barrel. [<A
HREF="notes4c.htm#2">2</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During one week of July, seven different properties
were bought and sold in Greenwater, and by the end of that month, the
demand for surveying and assaying support for the prospectors and
promoters was so great that two offices had been established in the
district. Over fifty miners were working for the five companies which
had started sinking by the end of July, innumerable others were combing
the hills for promising locations, and the Greenwater Miners Union was
organized. A crude road from the Rhyolite area had been carved out,
which cut travel time to five hours by auto, but still the water problem
plagued the development of the district. In addition, so many claims
were being located, sold, exchanged and relocated that inevitably
conflicts began to arise between claim holders.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Hundreds of thousands of dollars had changed hands by
the end of July, as feverish trading of mines and claims took place.
Five mining companies were organized, and the capital stock of four of
them reached the figure of $5,750,000. "This week auto after auto loaded
with prospective investors has gone to Greenwater, and the demand
locally for horses and rigs has almost exceeded the supply," reported
the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U>. The rush was causing scarcities in
Greenwater, and water rose to $7.50 per barrel, while horse teed was
almost as hard to find. But the rush continued, and "As is usual in new
Nevada mining camps the townsite epidemic has broken out in a decidely
virulent form. No less than three towns are already planned, and it is a
difficult matter at this time to tell which is going to be the
commercial center of the district. That there will be a flourishing town
in the district goes without saying, but which and where it will be is a
matter of conjecture at this writing. It has the most observing man
guessing."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As more and more prospectors flooded into the area,
concerns began to arise over their welfare. Printed warnings were
published in the Rhyolite papers, warning prospectors to bring all the
food and water they would need into the district with them, since none
could be provided there. Water was being hauled from Furnace Creek in
Death Valley, but "Teams making the trip to the creek and back, fifty
miles, drink about as much as they can deliver, making it almost
impossible to get any reserve supply. Unless travelers heed the timely
warning there is liable to be real suffering, and perhaps a number of
deaths," Several mine owners, who were importing water to meet the
demands of mining and to supply their employees, publically warred
prospective visitors that they could no longer afford to sell water to
private individuals.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But despite all these serious problems, there was no
denying the allure of the Greenwater District, and the rush continued in
August. By this time, the district was beginning to take shape,
competing towns had been surveyed and platted, and one of them had
established a boarding house. On July 29th, a meeting was held to
organize the new district, in order to alleviate some of the problems
caused by conflicting claims, and to remove the necessity for
prospectors to travel all the way to Independence, California, to record
their claims. The population of the district was now estimated at 300,
and several stores and a restaurant had opened for business. Kimball
Brothers, the staging kings of Rhyolite, announced a new stage line
which would make thrice-weekly trips into Greenwater, and one traveler
counted over 100 freighting wagons heading towards the district in one
day, straining their resources to supply the growing demands of the new
boom camp. Canned tomatoes were an especially popular item for sale at
the crude tent stores, since they were cheaper than water, which was now
selling for $10 a barrel, and quenched the thirst almost as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The rush to the new region had several unique
aspects, which the local newspapers were quick to spot. Due to the
extremely rich surface showings, money was pouring into the district at
a tremendous rate, before ground was even broken. As the <U>Rhyolite
Herald</U> noted, money seems to have beat labor to the scene of
activity, as the big capitalists were on the ground and buying claims
when no work has been done. It is not a poor man's region," agreed the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U>, "but one which will require a great deal of money
to develop it."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">All this business, of course, was good for the
Rhyolite area merchants, and the new boom was looked upon favorably.
"All Nevada is taking a hand in this rush," noted the <U>Inyo
Independent</U> "as practically the whole of the United States has been
told of its marvelous deposits of copper, which are revelations to
geologists and mining men in general. Although the district hardly
needed another spur to its boom, it got one anyway on August 10th, when
the organization of the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company was
announced. Promoted by Charles Schwab, the steel and mining millionaire
whose name was magic to Nevada miners, the new company was incorporated
for $3,000,000, and together with Patsy Clark's Furnace Creek Copper
Company, assured "a thorough and complete development of the
district."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the middle of August, the townsite rivalry was
beginning to take shape, as two major competitors emerged from the dust.
Arthur Kunze was the chief promoter of the first, and his town seemed to
have the edge. Alternating between the name of Kunze and Greenwater,
Kunze's townsite was located midway between the mines of the Furnace
Creek Copper Company and the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company--the
districts two largest mines. By mid-August, Kunze's townsite boasted of
two stores, and a hotel, a restaurant and several corrals were under
construction. The Salsberry Water Company was under contract to Kunze to
keep the camp supplied with water, and a petition was sent in for the
establishment of a Post Office.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Kimball Brothers obligingly routed their stage
line to Kunze's townsite, and the Tonopah Lumber Company, in addition to
establishing a lumber yard to supply the hectic construction pace, sent
down several 12-horse teams, to be used in hauling supplies from Johnnie
Siding of the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater Railroad to the new townsite. The
lumber company, in addition, supplied a 2,500 gallon water tank for the
townsite company, and Kunze's plat of the town, which showed thirty-two
blocks with over 550 lots for sale, was approved by the Inyo County
Commissioners on August 13th. Assessing the situation, the <U>Bullfrog
Miner</U> predicted that Kunze's camp seemed to have the inside track
over it main rival, the townsite promoted by Harry Ramsey.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Just to add to the confusion, Ramsey also insisted on
calling his townsite Greenwater, although it was commonly called Ramsey,
and less commonly called Copperfield. Whatever it was called, its
location was hard to pin down, since it was variously described as being
one to four miles east or southeast of Kunze's camp. Nor did Ramsey help
alleviate the confusion when he moved his site around at least once.
Nevertheless, Ramsey vigorously promoted his own town, and even tore
down his iron office building at Rhyolite and moved it to
Greenwater-Ramsey-Copperfield.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the rush continued, one observer counted $25,000
worth of supplies heading into the Greenwater District in one day, and
another counted 200 miners and prospectors in the area, not including
those who were out in the hills surrounding the camps. The
<U>Engineering Mining Journal</U> assessing the Greenwater boom, noted
that the "copper finds there recently have brought about an excitement
equal to that at Bullfrog two years ago. Hundreds of people from
Tonopah, Goldfield, Lida, Palmetto and the Bullfrog towns are traveling
towards Greenwater in all sorts of conveyances. As high as $200 is being
paid to automobile companies for transportation by wealthy operators who
are anxious to get in early."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But getting into Greenwater was not that easy for
those who could not afford the $200 to rent an auto. Those who arrived
by train via Johnnie Siding could sometimes hitch a ride on one of the
big freight teams constantly traveling between the railhead and
Greenwater, but that trip took from twelve to fifteen hours. The Kimball
stage took just as long, for the relatively reasonable rate of $18 per
passenger, but spaces were limited, and numerous travelers found
themselves forced to wait at Johnnie Siding for a day or two before
their turn on the stage came. One migrant described his trip to the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U>, "It's a fright of a trip; 55 miles from Johnnie
siding,; sand most of the way. Stage leaves Johnnie siding 3:00 p.m.;
had supper at Ash Meadows; camped for the night 10 miles this side of
it." Once arrived at Greenwater, the situation was not much better.
"About 70 to 100 men here and about 100 gallons of water, 15&cent; per
gallon. Meals $1 transiently, regular 1.50 a day. Store and a restaurant
here and about a dozen tents. The camp is on Kunze's ground. Clark
[Patsy Clark's mining camp, also known as Furnace] is about 2 miles west
and Ramsey 2 or 3 miles east"</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">As August came to an end, the Greenwater District
braced itself for the increasing rush which would undoubtedly come with
the cooler weather of the fall and winter. Arthur Kunze and Harry Ramsey
continued to promote their towns, and endeavored to attract the
merchants which would make their camps the winner. Ramsey formed the
Greenwater Townsite Company to promote his camp, and by the end of
August he had a restaurant, two saloons, a hotel and a store. Kunze,
meanwhile, had completed arrangements with several merchants, and the
Greenwater Banking Corporation was organized, with a capitalization of
$100,000, as well as the Greenwater Mercantile Company, which planned to
erect a large general merchandise store. In addition, Kunze's site had a
lodging house, a store, a saloon, a restaurant, and a number of tents as
well as a "first class assay office.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kunze seemed to have an advantage over Ramsey, since
his townsite was higher in the hills, and was cooler than Ramseys site,
which was on the floor of Greenwater Valley--an important consideration.
The local folk, however, were divided in their assessment of the future
winner of the townsite struggle, although the <U>Rhyolite Herald</U>
picked Ramsey's camp to win. But whoever won, "the townsites are lining
up for the struggle of supremacy and everything points to a prosperous
fail and winter." [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#3">3</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the fall season opened, the anticipated rush to
the Greenwater District exceeded all expectations. The ingoing stages
were crowded beyond capacity, and the congestion of freight and
passengers at Johnnie Siding grew alarming. Huge piles of freight built
up at the railhead, and many prospectors were reduced to walking the
fifty-five miles to the camps. The competing townsites took advantage of
the rush to proclaim their respective appeals.  Ramsey's camp, despite
being moved, still gave stiff competition to Arthur Kunze's town and
Patsy Clark's camp of Furnace--although the latter was never intended to
be more than a convenient camp for the miners working at Clark's Furnace
Creek Copper Company mines. Dr. S.  Trask of San Francisco was persuaded
by Kunze to move into his town and start a drug store, a new saloon was
started, and Bob Brogleman, proprietor of the Greenwater Mercantile
Company, began construction of his large store. Several more boarding
and lodging houses sprang up at Kunze's camp, until he could boast that
ample boarding and lodging accommodations could be had. The Greenwater
Banking Corporation started in business, and although the price of water
declined slightly to 15&cent; per gallon, water was still such a problem
that the Ash Meadows Water Company was organized, at a capitalization of
$3,000,000, in order to pump and pipe water in from that site to the
growing towns of Greenwater.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the middle of September, Jack Salsberry of the
Tonopah Lumber Company reported that he had sold 150,000 board feet of
lumber in Greenwater, and had orders backed up for 300,000 feet more. In
addition, the lumber company had contracted to haul 625 tons of freight
into the district, including 120 tons for the Kunze townsite and 16 tons
alone for Brogleman's store. The lumber company by now had large water
holding tanks erected at both Kunze's and Ramsey's townsites, and had
several six-horse teams constantly hauling in water to supply the
tanks.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Even though over 100 men were employed in the
fourteen mines working in the district, labor was becoming scarce, as
most men preferred to prospect on their own in the hopes of striking it
rich, rather than settling down to a regular job. But as the boom
continued, the camps seemed to show signs of being able to handle the
influx of migrants. Although water still cost from $8 to $0 per barrel,
"and the expense of feeding a mule is still as great as the money paid
by a sojourner at a first-class hotel in New York City," there was at
least enough tents so that most men who wished could sleep under cover,
and it was possible to obtain food in the camps. In order to supply the
increasing crowds, the Kimball Brothers increased their stage service
from Johnnie Siding to a daily basis, and promised to try to make the
trip to Greenwater in one day.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Al Neilson, the recorder of the Greenwater District,
reported on September 21st that he had recorded 700 claims since the
district was officially organized on September 6th. The <U>Inyo
Independent</U> reported in mid-September that the district now had at
least 1,000 people, with more crowding in every day. As could be
expected in the midst of such a boom, trading in Greenwater stocks went
wild. One company, the <U>Independent</U> reported, could fix its total
value at $5 million based upon the selling price of its stock, even
though it had sunk only to a depth of 280 feet, and had shipped no ore.
The Associated Press, in turn, reported that during a two week period in
September, sales aggregating a grand total of $4,125,000 had been made
in Greenwater, and the "price of everything in the district has shot sky
high." The <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U> noted that Greenwater
was "no place for a poor man, as provisions and water are both high in
price, though on the other hand any prospect which may be found may be
sold."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The Rhyolite brokerage firm of Taylor &amp;
Griffiths, who were gleefully trading Greenwater stocks as fast as they
could get their hands on them, also reported the same trend. "The
interest in the Greenwater district is intense. The demand for good
properties is far in excess of the supply." As examples, Furnace Creek
Copper stock, which had a par value of $1, and which was initially sold
for 50&cent; per share, was now trading around $4.50 per share, and
Greenwater Death Valley was selling around $2. Furnace Creek Extension
stock was put on the market at its par value of $1 per share, and was
immediately oversubscribed, even though the company had not yet stuck a
single pick into the ground. Greenwater, in short, was a promoters
dream.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As September came to an end, it seemed sometimes that
all of Rhyolite was decamping for the new district. Ramsey's town
reported a population of 200, and at Kunze's, Bob Brogleman reported
doing a land office business at his merchandise store, even though he
hadn't finished building it yet. The Rhyolite papers began to blossom
with large and elaborate advertisements placed by Greenwater companies,
most of whom were not yet working. In September alone, six more mining
companies were incorporated, bringing the total in the district to
sixteen. The capitalization of thirteen of those companies totaled over
$20 million. [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#4">4</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The month of October saw the height of Greenwater's
boom, as everyone took advantage of the cooler fall weather to get into
the district and locate good ground. During this month alone, fourteen
more mining companies were incorporated in the district. As usual, some
of these companies had mines, and some did not. With the great
proliferation of mines and mining companies, moreover, the less honest
of the mining promoters found it easy to cash in on the unbelievable
boom spirit which surrounded the Greenwater name. Taking their cues from
the two leading mines of the district, the Furnace Creek Copper Company
and the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company, a confusing list of
mining companies appeared on the local trading boards, as well as those
in San Francisco and New York. Who, for example, could hope to remember
the difference between the Furnace Creek Copper Company, the Greenwater
Furnace Creek Copper Company, and the Furnace Creek Consolidated Copper
Company, let alone the Greenwater Consolidated Copper Company, the
Greenwater Copper Mining Company, the Greenwater United Copper Company,
the United Greenwater Copper Company and the Greenwater Copper Company,
each of which was a distinct organization?</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As with the mines, the towns of Greenwater also
entered a true boom period. Construction began in early October on a
two-story building for the Greenwater Banking Corporation, and a safe
was ordered to store its money. By the middle of the month, the <U>Inyo
Independent</U> reported that investment capital in the new district had
already reached the $15 million mark. Every prominent copper operator in
the United States had some interest in the district, and claims had been
staked for twenty miles on every side of Greenwater. Over forty mining
engineers had made reports on the mineral potential of the area for
their respective employers, and it was the "unanimous opinion that
Greenwater will excel in copper production, both the camps of Bisbee and
Butte." [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#5">5</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The district by this time had 450 men and four women,
and Kunze's town of Greenwater had five saloons, three restaurants, two
general merchandise stores, and three lodging houses, where cots or
springs on an old dry goods box cost $1 per night. Telegraph and
telephone lines were being run from Bullfrog to Greenwater, and were
nearing the town. Some luxuries were available, but when the first case
of champagne entered the district, there were so many potential buyers
that it was put up for action and sold for $150. Due to the lack of ice,
liquor and water were both cooled by being stored in gunny sacks. The
water itself served many purposes, first being used to wash dishes,
second to wash clothes, and then given to the mules and burros to
drink.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Happily, wages soared as high as prices, since miners
who were willing to work steadily instead of prospecting on their own
were somewhat rare. Unskilled miners and common laborers commanded $4.50
per day, carpenters were paid $8 daily and were in great demand due to
the building boom, and expert miners received $5 to $5.50 per day. No
one worked more than an eight-hour day. The boom is growing more
tremendous with each day, summed up the <U>Inyo Independent</U> "Tons of
machinery are being crowded into the Greenwater district; freight has
become congested; every team for miles has been pressed into service and
people are hurrying into the district as fast as the stage line can
carry them."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Between forty and fifty mule teams were hauling in
supplies from Johnnie Siding, but no progress was made in reducing the
back-load which was still piled high at the railhead. Kunze's camp of
Greenwater was booming, and as much as $1500 was reported to have been
paid for an inside lot. Kunze even succeeded in landing the pearl of
every self-respecting mining camp, its own newspaper. On October 23d,
the first issue of the <U>Greenwater Times</U> appeared on the streets.
It was an eight page paper, published every Tuesday by James Brown and
Frank Reber, and halt of its eight pages were canned material.
Nevertheless, the rest of the issue was chock full of new, gossip and
tidbits, some confusing and most exaggerated.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By this time the camp of Greenwater was beginning to
change from a tent to a board town, and the <U>Greenwater Times</U> was
sure to note all the newly constructed buildings. Bob Brogleman,
proprietor of the Greenwater Mercantile Company, had a thirty by sixty
toot frame building with a "handsome rustic front," which housed his
store, hotel and restaurant. Messrs. Smith and Owsley had the newest
saloon, in a twenty by thirty-foot frame building with a shingled roof,
John Salsbury had an eighteen by thirty-foot office building almost
completed, and his thirty by sixty-foot store building would be finished
in a few days. Arthur Kunze's building was almost completed and it would
house the Post Office, which had been granted to his townsite, as well
as the bank and his private office. E. L. Phelps had his saloon in a
boarded tent, Tom Murphy was building a men's furnishings store, and J.
J. Griffith had let a contract for a twenty-room hotel. Commenting upon
the building boom, the <U>Greenwater Times</U> smugly predicted that it
was "safe to prognosticate that Greenwater will be growing thirty years
hence." After all, the "future of the city of Greenwater is surely as
open and easily read as any book--and the reading says it's the greatest
copper city of a century."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The advertisements carried in this first issue of
Greenwater's paper give an insight into other business establishments in
the town. In addition to the ones mentioned above, the Greenwater
Brokerage Company, the Greenwater Restaurant, Edward Behten's real
estate, investments and mining office, the Do Drop Inn, the Greenwater
Lumber Yard, the McKinney Glover law, mining, real estate and brokerage
company, the Greenwater Club, Hunter &amp; Hutner's civil, mining and
electrical engineering firm, J. C. Davidson, notary public, Reber &amp;
Company's real estate and mining information offices, the Bank Saloon,
and Kennedy &amp; Lass's assaying and surveying service, all placed
advertisements in the paper.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The booming mining business was also good for the
labor interests, and by late October, the Greenwater Miners Union was
over 00 strong. Meetings were held every Tuesday, and the Greenwater
Townsite Company donated two "very fine lots to the union, where they
intended to build their union hall. The miners started a fund drive to
build and staff a union hospital, and proudly proclaimed its motto
across the pages of the <U>Greenwater Times</U> "It is Justice the World
Needs! Not Charity!"</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In other news, the <U>Times</U> reported that the
chief engineer for the Las Vegas &amp; Tonopah Railroad was in town to
select the best rail route into the district, and that due to public
demand for living space, Patsy Clark had agreed to throw open his
townsite of Furnace, which had hitherto been reserved for employees of
his mine. Then, as was fitting, the first issue of the <U>Greenwater
Times</U> closed with a large advertisement for the Greenwater Townsite
Company. Greenwater was, according to this ad, "The Greatest Copper City
of the Century." The payroll at its mines already exceeded that of
Beatty, Bullfrog and Rhyolite combined, and $52,500 in real estate had
been sold in Greenwater in the month of September. Still, however,
business lots were available at "ground floor prices" to anyone
interested.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Less than a week later, the <U>Inyo Independent</U>
took its turn at marveling at the wonder of the eastern California
desert. Lock at the place, the paper said, where back in July only one
tent was to be seen. Now Greenwater was a well laid out city, with over
1,000 people in the district. At the present rate, the population would
be 2,000 before the year was over The <U>Bullfrog Miner</U>, noting the
same week that nearly $20,000,000 had been invested in 100 claims in the
last six months at Greenwater, agreed that "by far the most sensational
jump into prominence of any mining camp added to the map in many years
is that of Greenwater . . . Greenwater is without doubt the greatest
copper mining territory ever found in the world." Only the
<U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U>, the far away and much more
staid publication, managed to hold its breath. In a much more realistic
appraisal, and one which immediately became immensely unpopular in
Greenwater, the <U>Journal</U> noted that the "district is too new,
however, to permit of trustworthy predictions as to its future, and it
will take many months before development work can be carried far enough
to establish its real value, and make it a factor in copper production.
The present indications, however, are promising."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Although the <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U>
was absolutely correct in stating that it would be many months before
anyone began making money by mining copper, that was too cold an
assessment for a boom town. There were much easier and quicker methods
of making money in a boom town, and although all of them were risky,
there was not a lack of men who were wilting to try. Charles Crismor,
for example, was a favorite Horatio Alger-type story much played up by
the local papers. Arriving in Rhyolite in January of 1906 with 30&cent;
in his pocket, he had entered the restaurant business there. With the
advent of the Greenwater boom, Crismor had grubstaked two prospectors
with left-over food from his dining room, and by the 1st of November had
sold the claims which they staked for a $150,000 profit. Such was the
way money was made at Greenwater. The promoters who bought those
prospects, in turn, incorporated a mining company to find cut if there
was any ore in the ground, and sold stock shares to the investing
public, which by now extended from the west to the east coast. The
promoters paid themselves salaries out of the proceeds of the stock
sales, and used the rest of the funds to look for ore. Only if ore was
found would a profit flow back to the stockholders. H the meantime, as
long as the boom lasted and people could be persuaded to invest their
money in Greenwater's mines, everyone on the ground was making
money.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the boom continued and the mineral district spread
farther and farther out across the desert, new towns appeared to
accommodate those miners who lived too far from Greenwater, Copperfield
or Furnace to walk to work. South Greenwater, for example, was started
on the grounds of the Pittsburgh-Greenwater Copper Company, fifteen
miles south of Greenwater itself, in early November, Later that month,
the town of East Greenwater was started, to serve the mines in that
area, approximately eight miles east. At about the same time, the first
gas hoists began to arrive in the district, marking the transition of
some of the companies from the exploration to the development stage of
mining. Eleven more mining companies were incorporated in November,
bringing the total in the district to forty-one. Many times that number
of small mines, locations and prospects were also being held and worked
by individual miners who were awaiting the proper price to sell their
locations to mining companies.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">And the towns continued to grow. Our best information
concerns Kunze's Greenwater, since the <U>Greenwater Times</U> naturally
boosted its own town over the rival camps. By November 6th, Greenwater
had two barber shops, and twenty wooden buildings were in the course of
construction. A lawyer had moved to town, to take advantage of the
lucrative fees involved in the inevitable mining conflicts, Paul Wiesse
had started a butcher shop, and two more restaurants were ready to open,
bringing the total to five. T, E. Blake opened a shoe repair shop, two
more offices full of mining engineers and surveyors opened, and J. C.
Collins announced the grand opening of his Undertaker and Scientific
Embalmer' services. So many carpenters were now in camp, serving the
demands of the building boom, that they organized themselves as a local
branch of the Nevada carpenters union.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Despite the boom fever, there were several firms
besides the <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U> which managed to
resist the excitement of the rush. William Clark, president of the Las
Vegas &amp; Tonopah Railroad, for example, resisted the heavy local
pressure to begin immediate construction of a branch line into
Greenwater, and instead more reasonably announced that the branch road
would be built "just as soon as we are fully assured of the camps'
permanency." The pressure on Clark was tremendous, for if Greenwater did
turn into a productive camp, the first railroad into the district would
reap enormous profits. !n addition, the Greenwater fever had invaded the
Clark family itself, for J. Ross Clark, William's brother, had invested
in the district and incorporated the Clark Copper Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the middle of November, the Greenwater phenomenon
could no longer be called a boom or a rush in the usual meanings of
those terms, and the <U>Inyo Register</U> described it best as a
"stampede." No less than 100 people, said that paper, were arriving in
the district every day, and still the demand for labor far exceeded the
supply, since most of the newcomers preferred to look for their private
bonanzas rather than settle down to shift work in the mines. As a
partial remedy, mine superintendents had taken to placing pickets down
the trails leading into town, in order to grab the miners as they
arrived, and offer them jobs.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> But the district still had several rather
insurmountable problems, and in mid-November one of them was graphically
highlighted when one of the water wagons serving the holdings tanks of
the town broke down. An immediate panic ensued, and water prices shot up
to $20 per barrel before the wagon could be repaired. It was a reminder,
if any need be had, that Greenwater would never become a producing
district until the water and transportation problems were solved, for
under the present services only the very highest grades of copper ore
could be profitably shipped out of the district.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the end of November, the Greenwater stampede was
of such proportions that although the district had yet to ship a single
sack of ore, it was getting almost weekly coverage by the national
mining journals. California and Nevada prospectors, miners and
capitalists are thronging into the new copper camp of Greenwater . . . .
as fast as they can get there by automobile, stage, wagon, burro or
afoot wrote the <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U> "The trails
across Death Valley and the Amargosa desert are filled with men on the
way. Rich men, ready to buy anything with a likely look are plentiful,
which is a sure proof that the camp is on the boom . . . . From a
population of 75 at the end of October, the camp has grown to 1,000 in a
few weeks, and not less than 100 men a day are arriving. Labor is in
demand, and already about 500 miners have been set to work on the big
properties, and as fast as experienced miners come in they are at once
given employment." As one single example of the continuing boom, Thomas
W. Lawson of Boston, a noted copper operator and millionaire,
purchased the Greenwater Red Boy and Greenwater Saratoga Mining
Companies in late November for a reported $2,000,000 in hard cash, and
immediately announced plans to erect a copper smelter. Indicative of
this boom spirit purchase is the fact that Lawson intimated that the
smelter would be built at Greenwater, regardless of the fact that there
was no where nearly enough water anywhere around Greenwater to support a
smelting plant. One wonders how carefully Lawson considered his purchase
before laying down his money.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By now the Greenwater boom was so great that the
competition between the Kunze and Ramsey townsites became impractical.
Kunze's site, due to its location nearer the larger mines, and its
success in obtaining a Post Office, a newspaper and several leading
business houses, was clearly leading in the townsite race over Ramsey's
camp, but there were problems involved in Kunze's physical location. His
camp was perched up in the Greenwater Hills, practically on the end line
of the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company mines, and only a wooden
fence kept drunken miners from walking off the end of one of Kunze's
streets into one of the mines' shafts.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In addition, the leading mine owners of the district
realized that a railroad was an absolute necessity for the future
prosperity of Greenwater, and building a railroad into Kunze's town
would be difficult, due to its location in the hills overlooking
Greenwater Valley. Nor were the railroad interests very anxious to build
directly into the heart of the mining district, for they had painfully
learned at Tonopah how expensive it was to lay tracks over active and
conflicting mining claims. Thus the railroad companies, both for ease of
construction and avoidance of involvement in expensive land battles,
preferred to build their rail heads at spots away from the actual mines.
Charles Schwab, in turn, was growing uneasy at the prospect of a large
town night on top of his mining claims, since that would lead to
difficulties in opening up new ground when the time came. For a
combination of these reasons, the leading promoters of the district
decided in late November to move Kunze's camp of Greenwater away from
its present location and down into the Greenwater Valley below, where
railroad construction and and acquisition would be much easier and less
expensive. After all, the planners at this time were expecting
Greenwater to blossom into a city of thousands, rivaling the other great
copper towns of the United States, such as Butte, Montana, and there
simply was not enough room at Kunze's site for such an expansion.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As a result, Harry Ramsey's camp of Copperfield,
which had never enjoyed the prosperity of Kunze's, suddenly found itself
saved. A new Greenwater Townsite company was incorporated, which bought
out the interest of both Ramsey and Kunze in their old townsites, and
backed by the capital of the leading mining promoters, announced that
the entire Kunze townsite would be moved down into the valley, near
Ramsey's old site. Owners of lots in both Kunze's and Ramsey's old
townsite would be given lots of equal value and location in the new
town, and the new combined townsite would carry the name of
Greenwater.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">After the announcement of the townsite consolidation,
the Las Vegas &amp; Tonopah Railroad reported that it would build a spur
into the new site, and John Brock announced that he would soon start
construction on a $60,000 hotel. All was not well, however, for with the
coming of winter, although mild snowfalls helped alleviate the water
shortage, the cold weather immediately pointed out another serious
supply problem in the district. Wood was almost unavailable as a fuel to
warm the tents and buildings of the district, and Greenwater residents
began to experience a "lively skirmish to get enough greasewood to keep
warm."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Then, just to keep the townsite situation from
becoming too calm, Patsy Clark decided to promote his townsite of
Furnace, and ads began running in the Rhyolite newspapers. Lots were on
sale, according to the ads, for $250 to $750 apiece, and over $30,000
worth of lots had already been sold. FURNACE," the ad proclaimed, "WILL
BE THE METROPOLIS OF THE GREENWATER DISTRICT."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But wherever they were located, and whatever they
were called, all the towns of the district continued to expand. The
Southern Nevada Telegraph and Telephone Company completed the extension
of its telegraph lines into the district in mid-December, and promised
that the telephone lines would soon be finished as well. Wells were
being sunk by several hopeful individuals and water was struck in one,
eighteen miles from town. The Greenwater Townsite Company began laying
pipe from Greenwater Springs to the townsite, although the flow of that
spring was nowhere near enough to accommodate the demand.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the end of 1906, with the population of the
district pushing 1,500, the boom was finally slowing down, although
everyone blamed the unprecendented cold weather rather than any
abatement of the Greenwater fever. Several snow storms in late December
caused much suffering, and the price of greasewood, which became
increasingly scarce, rose to $15 a wagon load. Twenty loads, it was
reported, were necessary to equal the burning power of a normal cord of
wood. The cold weather stopped work on most of the mines, for only those
whose shafts were deep enough to escape the effects of the weather were
able to continue work. Still, nine more mining companies were
incorporated in the district in December, bringing the total to fifty,
and everyone sat back, waiting for a break in the weather, so that
Greenwater's unprecendented stampede could continue. During the lull in
the the action, the townsite move began, and New Greenwater, "The
Greatest Copper Camp on Earth," was born. [<A

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Hard on the heels of the townsite consolidation came
the news of another large merger, which set even the feverish minds of
Greenwater agog. Several of the leading mine owners, realizing that the
district needed a smelter in order to become a producer, announced the
formation of a giant merger towards that purpose. On December 15th,
Charles Schwab, John Brock, and some financiers from Philadelphia formed
the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Mines &amp; Smelting Company. The
merger company had a capital stock of 5,000,000 shares, par value $5
each, for a total capitalization of $25,000,000--an amazing sum which
astounded even such boom-hardened towns as Goldfield and Tonopah. The
new corporation was essentially a holding company, and consisted of the
majority interests in the Greenwater Death Valley Copper company, the
United Greenwater Copper company, and the unincorporated mines belonging
to Brock and the Philadelphians. By pooling their resources, Schwab and
his partners hoped to  be able to cut costs and erect a large smelting
plant for the reduction of the ores from each of the mines. Although no
specific site was announced, Ash Meadows immediately became the leading
contender for the smelter site, due to its proximity to a plentiful
water supply and the railroads.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The new company announced that it would build its own
branch railroad from the mines to the smelter area, thirty miles away,
and that work would immediately begin on the railroad spur, the water
development at the smelter site, and construction of the smelter itself.
A smelting expert was hired by the merger company for $25,000 per year
to supervise the selection of the plant site and construction of the
smelter. In the meantime, although the mines involved in the merger came
under the umbrella supervision of the new corporation, each would retain
its separate identity and would continue to pursue its own development
independently.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Spurred by this news, developments at Greenwater
continued at a rather hectic pace. The townsite merger was being carried
out, and in addition, Patsy Clark, who stayed outside of both the
townsite and mining mergers, continued to plug his town of Furnace, By
January 1st, that site was described as containing stores, business
houses and a hotel. A separate stage line connected it with Amargosa,
and a Post Office had been requested.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The new townsite of Greenwater was likewise
experiencing growth, in addition to the confusion of consolidation. A
second weekly newspaper, the <U>Greenwater Miner</U>, was started by an
editor who was attracted to the boom district all the way from Nome,
Alaska, and several more assaying, surveying and brokerage offices
opened. But January saw yet another young publication start up, which
turned out to be one of Greenwater's unique claims to fame, On January
1st, the first issue of the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> hit the
streets. The little magazine, published by C. E. Kunze and C. B.
Glasscock, was best described by Glasscock in later years as "freakish."
it was printed on butcher paper, for economy, and the two young editors
launched their enterprise with a total capital stock of $35. As its
advertisements read, it was "A Magazine for MEN." It was "written in a
vein to please. It is entertaining as well as valuable. It exposes the
crooks, the wildcats and the frauds, and roasts the knockers." And, as
the cover declared, it was "Published on the desert at the brink of
Death Valley. Mixing the dope, cool from the mountains, and hot from the
desert, and withal putting out a concoction with which you can dc as you
damn well please as soon as you have paid for it. PRICE, TEN CENTS."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The first issue of the <U>Death Valley
Chuck-Walla</U> was especially unique, for it vividly described the
total contusion inherent in the townsite move which was currently taking
place. In an article, aptly titled "A Town on Wheels," the movement was
portrayed: ". . . pandemonium reigns. Saloons and boarding houses,
stores, and brokerage firms are doing business on the run and trying to
be on both sides of the mountain at one time. A barkeep puts down his
case of bottles on a knoll en route from the old camp to the new, and
serves the passing throng laden with bedding and store fixtures . . . .
The butcher kills a cow en route and deals out steaks and roasts to the
hungry multitude hurrying back to the old camp to get the necessities
for the new. Those who remain in the old camp are walking two miles to
the new to get the eggs for breakfast. Those who have journeyed to the
new are walking two miles to the old to get their mail, and a pair of
socks. Through it all Jack Salsbury, Harry Ramsey and the Townsite
Company smile . . . Questions as to the cause of the change are referred
to the anti-publicity committee, and picturesque and forceful language
as to the advisability of the change noted and filed for reference.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The <U>Chuck-Walla</U> had other aspects as well.
Although the editors were totally committed to boosting the Greenwater
District, they also realized that the proliferation of fraudulent mining
schemes would hurt the district in the long run, and made it their pet
project to uncover mining companies who were bilking the public. The
first issue carried a long article damning the manipulations of the
Boston-Greenwater Copper Company, promoted by J. Grant Lyman and his
Union Securities company, Lyman, it may be remembered, had been arrested
in Boston for pushing stock sales for non-existent mines around the
Bullfrog area, and he was doing the same at Greenwater.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By January 4th, the <U>Rhyolite Herald</U> was able
to report that the townsite consolidation was complete. Although the
total population of the district and its towns was not easy to estimate,
since so many men were constantly thronging through the hills, the
<U>Herald</U> estimated it at between 1,500 and 2,000. More important,
however, for the development of the mining district, was the report from
the Fairbanks-Morse Company that it had received orders for at least
twenty hoists of various sizes for the district, which indicated that
more and more companies were beginning the transition from exploration
to the development stage of mining. All the district needed in order to
pass from a boom camp into a permanent mining town was for one big mine
to make the next step, from development into production.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">New Greenwater, meanwhile, reported thriving
business. The townsite company surveyed 2,200 lots in over 130 blocks at
the new site, and reported brisk sales. Lots on main Street sold from
$500 to $5,000 apiece, and the county supervisors of Inyo county
approved the townsite plat. The continuing cold weather, however, put a
damper on business, as one miner reported that it was "fiercely
damnable, and we put two-thirds of the time trying to rustle greasewood
enough to keep from freezing." Despite the snowfall, water was still in
short supply and was selling for $10 per barrel.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Nor were freight difficulties made any easier by the
weather. The trip from Johnnie Siding by a loaded freight wagon took
three to four days, and freight costs were still extremely high, due to
the lack of enough teams to supply the demand. Freight charges from
Johnnie Siding to Greenwater were $60 per ton, which succeeded in
driving subsistence costs at Greenwater through the roof. The Greenwater
Bank, however, reported no lack of business due to high costs, and in
one week early in January reported $20,000 worth of transactions.
Visitors to the district at this time could watch four separate
surveying parties on the ground at the new townsite, as both the Las
Vegas &amp; Tonopah and the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater Railroads had survey
crews considering lines into the town, and the Southern Nevada Telegraph
and Telephone Company also had two crews out, surveying lines for the
telegraph and telephone extensions into New Greenwater, Farther up the
road, a fifth survey crew could be seen laying out a new access road
into Furnace. All in all, as the <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U>
noted, "There seems to be no diminution of the rush to the Greenwater .
. ." The <U>Journal</U> however, was still puzzled about the Greenwater
madness, for as it noted, "as yet none of the camps in that region has
become productive."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U> was not
the only publication to wonder at the immense rush into Greenwater. The
<U>Mining World</U>, in late January, noted that "It is too early to
predict the possibilities of this district. Its remoteness from
transportation facilities and water have retarded its development, but
notwithstanding the many difficulties encountered, very active work is
being prosecuted on about 50 different properties. During the next six
months, exploratory work will have probably progressed sufficiently to
determine the persistence of the ore deposits. That was the crux: why
was so much money being poured into the district, when the very
existence of the ore deposits below the surface level had not yet been
proven? Apparently the boom spirit, which had been ravaging throughout
Nevada and eastern California since the bonanza discoveries at Tonopah
and Goldfield, reached its height at Greenwater. In addition, since
copper deposits at other camps such as Bisbee and Butte had always
improved with depth, everyone assumed that the same would hold true for
Greenwater. Since the surface richness at Greenwater far surpassed that
of any copper camp ever, who could fail to think that Greenwater could
indeed become the Greatest Copper Camp on Earth?</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">One paper, at least, did think exactly that. In late
January the <U>Goldfield Gossip</U> printed its own assessment of the
Greenwater District, and it was one which flew directly in the face of
all the local predictions. "We have dissected reports from as many
sources as possible regarding the future of Greenwater," wrote the
<U>Gossip</U> "and all these agree that the camp would never make a
production of copper to amount to anything." As might be expected, that
report caused an immediate and extreme reaction from the Greenwater
papers, particularly the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> which more than
adequately fulfilled its promise to "roast the knockers." The
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U> also scorned the <U>Goldfield Gossip's</U>
assessment, and printed its own: ". . . there can be but one future for
Greenwater and that will be expressed by the six words 'Greatest Copper
Camp in the World."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> In the end, however, no one would know for sure
whether Greenwater would turn into a producer or not until the actual
time arrived, and meanwhile the Greenwater District enjoyed its booming
prosperity. In late January, the <U>Greenwater Times</U> and the
<U>Greenwater Miner</U> reported that the district had enjoyed its first
marriage celebration. The growing affluence of the desert camp was also
indicated by the notice of a piano for sale, and the Death Valley Auto
Company was established, In addition, a town government committee was
organized to supervise sanitary and police measures, and Inyo County
appointed a Justice of the Peace and a constable for the district.
District Recorder Nelson informed the papers that 3,000 location notices
had been made in his book during the last five months, and estimated
that probably 1,500 more had been recorded directly into the Inyo County
books at Independence.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">By mid-February, the <U>Rhyolite Herald</U> reported
that it was confident that the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater would build a
branch into the Greenwater District, and even speculated that the road
would be finished by June 1st. The <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> in
its mid-February issue, put the population of the district at 2,000,
including 500 in the town of Furnace, which was beginning to emerge as a
real rival to the new Greenwater townsite. By this time, seventeen more
mining companies had been incorporated since the first of the year,
bringing the total of incorporated mining companies in the district to
sixty-seven, but not all of them were working. Indeed, some of them
never worked at all, as they were designed more to mine the pockets of
gullible investors than to mine the ground. The <U>Death Valley
Chuck-Walla</U> in one of its more valuable contributions, listed the
mines of the area, and indicated that twenty-three of them were actually
mining for copper.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Many of the mines listed by the <U>Death Valley
Chuck-Walla</U> were not working, although most were planning to, and
the magazine went on to specifically denounce several which it had
proven were frauds. Neither the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Mining
Company, for example, nor the Greenwater Consolidated Mining Company
appeared to own any ground in the district, although both were actively
advertising and selling stock. The Greenwater Death Valley Copper Mining
Company in particular seemed to be relying on the close similarity
between its name and that of the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company
to bilk unwary investors of their money, for the latter was one of
Greenwater's biggest active concerns.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The same issue of the <U>Chuck-Walla</U> carried a
large ad for the Greenwater Townsite Company, which optimistically
forecast that Greenwater would soon be the center of three railroads.
The district's population, according to the ad, was over 2,000, and two
telephone and telegraph lines were doing business. "Since the first of
December lots have doubled in value. This is due to the fact that there
is no question whatever about the permanency and future of the place.
Greenwater is destined to be the richest mineral producing city on the
whole globe." In addition, the magazine carried ads for several new
Greenwater businesses, including the Greenwater Drug Company, and Alkali
Bill's Death Valley Chug Line, a fanciful name for a desert character
and his one automobile, who claimed he could take anyone anywhere for
the proper price. Greenwater was now becoming so full of its own future,
that the Engineering &amp; <U>Mining Journal</U> reported that "From the
desert comes the news that the Greenwater people believe that they are
growing so rapidly that they need a county all to themselves, with
Greenwater as the county seat."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But as February drew to a close, there was a decided
slackening in the great Greenwater boom. The district had now been
opened for well over a year, and had been in a boom stage for more than
half that time, and as of yet, none of the companies which were sinking
their shafts had found any ore under the surface which could compare
with the rich surface streaks that had started the boom. This fact,
while slow to dawn upon the district itself, was beginning to become
apparent in the nation-wide stock market. The Rhyolite brokerage firm of
Taylor &amp; Griffiths also noted the trend, and commented in late
February that the demand for Greenwater securities of acknowledged merit
. . . has not been what it should be," but went on in the same breath to
push stock sales. From a development standpoint, this district is making
a most excellent showing . . . . The surface showing in the Greenwater
district has never been surpassed in the history of copper mining . . .
. It is now time for the man who is inclined toward copper to get in and
secure same of this stock while it is low.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> also noted the same slight
slackening of the Greenwater boom, and reported that while "there is
somewhat of a dullness pervading the camp, as far as the influx of
people and industries is concerned, the properties are looking mighty
fine. In a way, Greenwater was starting to succumb to its own over-blown
boom publicity, for after the stampede to the district began to subside,
everything else looked less than normal by comparison. [<A
HREF="notes4c.htm#6">6</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But at the time, no one could possibly have hoped to
persuade a Greenwater citizen that the bloom was beginning to fade. On
March 1st, the papers reported that the Greenwater Death Valley Copper
Mines &amp; Smelting Company was beginning to work on the smelter site
at Ash Meadows. More immediate encouragement came from the news that Mr.
Lemle was opening a sub-agency for Budweiser at Greenwater, and was
arranging for daily ice delivery via auto. "If he can run his autos over
the hot roads fast enough to keep the ice from melting en route," said
the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> "he will surely catch the trade."
During the same week, the Greenwater Meat Company was organized, and
advertised that it would drive cattle across two mountain ranges from
Owens Valley, California, to Greenwater, in order to furnish a constant
supply of fresh meat daily to Greenwater inhabitants. The Furnace
Townsite Company also stepped up its advertisements, and the Greenwater
Townsite Company countered by running its own ads, plugging the unique
and desirable aspects of its camp. In its bi-weekly rundown on
Greenwater mining, the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> was able to list
twenty-one mines and mining companies who were actively working in the
district.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Still, qualms of uneasiness were beginning to be felt
around the district. The <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> was the first local paper
to admit such, noting that "As yet there are no real mines in
Greenwater, as mining men understand the term." The paper went on to
qualify that statement, adding that the working shafts are down several
hundred feet and the ore bodies are well enough defined so that the
owners know that they have immense quantities of very valuable rock, but
the workings so far have been confined to these shafts and no effort has
yet been made to take out ore except such as was necessary in sinking
the shafts." Privately, many Bullfrog operators were glad to see that
the Greenwater boom was abating, for at the height of the rush, the
drain of investment money towards Greenwater had decidedly hampered the
operation of the mines around the Bullfrog District.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The mid-March issue of the <U>Death Valley
Chuck-Walla</U> noted little change in the district, with nineteen
companies actively working. On the brighter side, the <U>Inyo
Register</U> reported on March 15th that articles had been filed at
Jersey City, New Jersey, to incorporate the Tonopah &amp; Greenwater
Railroad Company, with the purpose of building a railroad from the
Amargosa Borax works to the Greenwater District. A capital stock of
$500,000 had been created, and the construction of such a road, which
would easily tie into the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater, would mean a ready
outlet for Greenwater's ores. Although no announcements were made, the
<U>Inyo Independent</U> speculated that the recent incorporation
undoubtedly meant that the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater itself had decided
not to build into Greenwater. The new railroad company was expected to
start work soon, and complete the line by July 1st. Two routes had
already been surveyed into the district, but no decision had been made
as to which one to use.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the end of March, the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> put
the population of the district at 2,000, which indicated that for the
first month since the district had been discovered, it had not grown.
Both Greenwater and Furnace, however, were described as being very alive
and bustling, and both townsites had hotels, lodging houses, saloons,
feed corrals, freight companies, meat markets, auto lines, brokerage
houses, attorneys, newspapers, boarding houses, etc. In addition, three
railroad lines had been surveyed into the district, the Ash Meadows
water company was working on getting water piped into the district, and
an electric light system was projected for the towns.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But the boom had definitely slowed, as evidenced by
the incorporation of only seven more companies in the district in March.
The following months of April and May would see one additional company
incorporated during each, bringing the total of incorporated mining
companies in the Greenwater district to seventy-three. Although that was
more than enough, the cessation of incorporations meant that the
exploration stage of the Greenwater district had finally drawn to a
close, after a short but extremely violent boom, and the future of the
district now depended upon what ore bodies were found under the ground
during the subsequent development phase.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On April 1st, the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U>
reported that twenty-four companies were presently engaged in finding
out exactly what did lie under the surface of the ground. The pipe line
for the Ash Meadows water system had been ordered, and a telephone
connection had been completed between Greenwater and Furnace, enabling
conversation between the two rival towns. Plans had also been announced
for a new $50,000 hotel.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Two weeks later, the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U>
was able to report twenty-six companies working, but as of yet no one
had found sufficient ore bodies beneath the surface of the earth to
warrant full-scale production mining. Towards the end of April, the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U> reported that 300 men were working in the
district, with about half being employed in the mines around Greenwater
and the other half around Furnace. The payroll for the district was
approaching $50,000 per month. The townsites had settled down from the
boom period, and Greenwater was described as being mainly a rag town,
although it had some wooden and one iron building. Lumber was still very
expensive, costing $130 per thousand board feet, which depressed the
building industry, but the bank was thriving, and business in general
was good. Water still sold for the very high price of $7.50, as compared
to $5 per barrel which had been the highest price Bullfrog had known in
its early boom days.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By the first of May, although twenty-six companies
were still actively engaging in development work, it was becoming very
apparent that unless someone found a large profitable copper lode soon,
the district would be in trouble. The investing public, which by now
expected great things from the district which had boomed so brilliantly,
was becoming impatient, and as another month passed without any big ore
strikes being made, stock prices began to slip.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> noted the stock
slump, but blamed it on the eastern Wall Street stock manipulators "who
wish to bear the stocks until they can be purchased at a rate far below
their real value and therefore at great profit." In reality, the
Greenwater boom had led to too great of expectations from the investing
public, and suspicions of a gigantic fraud were now beginning to form
among the ranks of far-off investors. Nor did it help the Greenwater
District that the first effects of the Panic of 1907 were beginning to
be felt on the eastern stock markets. Naturally, shares of mining
companies which were still in the initial stages of development were
among the first to be unloaded by cash-hungry investors. Still, no one
was ready to give up, least of all the naive young men publishing the
<U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> They could write with pride that their
magazine was read by more than nine thousand stock brokers across the
nation, although they sadly noted that only 1,000 of them had paid for
their subscriptions. [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#7">7</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On May 1st, the Ash Meadows Water Company ordered 135
miles of pipe for its various lines into Greenwater, Lee and other
spots. The line to Greenwater, it announced, should be completed by the
middle of August, when water would be available for around $4 per
barrel. During the same week, Inyo County belatedly got around to
implementing a full civil government for the district, appointing a
deputy sheriff, a deputy district attorney, a deputy assessor, a deputy
tax collector and a new Justice of the Peace. By the middle of the
month, the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> could report 300 miners still
at work. One company had no less than six gas hoists going full blast,
and several were down to the 300 and 400-foot levels. Unfortunately, no
ore bodies had yet been found.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Towards the end of May, the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater
Railroad announced the opening of Zabriskie Station, which cut the
distance between Greenwater and the railroad considerably. The company
also announced the establishment of an auto service between the station
and Greenwater, with connections to both daily trains. The auto ride
would take two and a half hours, and tickets were available from the
commercial agent permanently stationed in Greenwater. The Inyo County
commissioners also announced plans to consider the erection of a
turnpike from independence to Greenwater, at an estimated cost of
$1,000, whereby travel time between the two towns would be shortened by
several days.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On June 1st, the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U>
could still point to twenty-five companies at work, and although no
sizeable ore bodies had yet been found, no one seemed quite willing to
give up. Articles from the district's two other papers, the
<U>Greenwater Times</U> and the <U>Greenwater Miner</U>, also contained
the same hopeful spirit, and the <U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U>
noted that fifteen gas hoists were at work throughout the district, and
that more miners were at work than ever before. For once, the labor
problem seemed to be solved, for the buying and selling of claims had
ceased with the coming of harder times, and more and more miners were
willing to give up their dreams of instant wealth and settle down to
earning a steady wage. In late June, the Inyo County Board of
Supervisors let out bids to construct a branch jail at Greenwater, and
announced that the proposed sixteen by twenty-foot stone and cement
building would contain three cells.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Then, on June 22d, the inevitable fire swept through
part of Greenwater. Although the relative damage was rather light,
considering the destructive potential for fires in mining camps built of
canvas and wood, one saloon and the offices and presses of both the
<U>Greenwater Miner</U> and the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> were
consumed. The editors of the <U>Chuck-Walla</U> had only recently bought
out the <U>Greenwater Miner</U>, and they immediately announced plans to
secure a new printing plant from the west coast and continue both
publications. But the capital stock of $35 which they had started out
with had not increased very much over their six months of publication
and after several weeks of trying to get their paper printed at the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U> office, the editors gave up and left the country.
The Las Vegas one of the more mature Nevada newspapers which had never
much approved of the style or approach of the <U>Chuck-Walla</U>, noted
that it "was roasted alive by the Angel of Fire because of the many
unholy things it has printed. The destruction of the <U>Miner</U>,
(whose sins are less notorious) and the saloon only proved that
chastisement, like rain, falls alike upon the just and the unjust."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The fire seemed to be an omen, for with the passing
of the <U>Death Valley Chuck-Walla</U> Greenwater's loudest and
brassiest booster, the fire seemed to go out of the district. The Ash
Meadows Water Company, for example, had promised on June 29th that water
would be connected into Greenwater by the 1st of August, but by July
13th, revised that date to September 15th, and added that pipe would be
laid into Lee before Greenwater--indicating that the prospects of the
Lee District now looked better to that company than did those at
Greenwater.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the summer wore on and fall approached, it became
apparent to all but the most die-hard that the great Greenwater boom had
started to bust, and many people could be seen quietly leaving town. As
a continuing barometer, the Ash Meadows Water Company postponed its
connections to Greenwater once again, and announced on September 13th
that water would not be available to the district until the middle of
November. Those who still had faith tried to explain away the decline of
the district by advancing various causes. "The present situation is one
of those cyclic occurrences that simply hampers the growth of what is
coming," said one, "but will not stop it for you have the wares that the
world needs so much." "The camp, as far as the town is concerned, is
very quiet," noted another observor, "but work in the mines is going
steadily on . . . . There is not much doubt as to the ultimate future of
Greenwater. The camp is now going through the development period, which
all camps have to undergo, in laying the foundation for their future
prosperity.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But if the mines were still developing, not nearly as
many were doing so as in previous months. Of the seventy-three companies
which had incorporated to do business in Greenwater by the spring of
1907, only twelve were left by September. Although these figures must be
qualified by pointing out that fully thirty of those companies never did
any work at all, still it was apparent that the mining situation at
Greenwater was definitely on the decline, and unless some ore was found
soon, the camp would die. The Panic of 1907, which was beginning to hit
the mining regions of the west by this time, obviously aggravated the
problem.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Businesses, such as the Greenwater Lumber Yard, began
to close their doors in the summer of 1907, and as the fall progressed,
the trend increased. Fires again played a part, such as in mid-October,
when Charley Hennessy's saloon, the Death Valley Vault, burned to the
ground. Once the fire started, as in the case of the
<U>Chuck-Walla's</U> office, the building was allowed to burn
completely, since water to put out the fire was more expensive than the
wood necessary to rebuild. The loss of the Death Valley Vault, however,
was especially hard to take, since it had become famous throughout the
district by offering a free face wash with every drink purchased.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Although fifteen hoists were still in operation in
Greenwater in mid-October, and "more extensive development is expected
as soon as the weather becomes cooler," even the local papers were
beginning to wonder about the future of the district. The <U>Inyo
Register</U> noted on October 17th that the "impression prevails that
Greenwater is not in the best condition as regards mining showing, but
protested a week later that "Greenwater has, for some occult reason been
pronounced dead, or at least in decline. The facts in the case do not
bear out such a statement.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Still, the paper noted that the population of the
district was now estimated at 500, down considerably from the 2,000 of
the previous spring.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The departure of businessmen continued in November,
and included one of the editors of the <U>Greenwater Times</U> who sold
out his half interest to his partner. "From a business standpoint the
camp is on the bum," he told the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> "but from a
mining standpoint it looks better than ever." If from a mining
standpoint he meant that the mines were reaching increasing depths, he
was right, for two of Greenwater's biggest mines had by now sunk to 500
feet below the surface of the earth. But they still had not found the
elusive copper deposits without which the district could not
survive.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">And as 1907 ended, those ore bodies were still not
located. The district experienced a mild revival in December, as mine
owners and prospectors came back in to do the annual assessment work on
claims and locations in order to protect their titles for another year.
But as the year ended, the population had shrunk to "several hundred,"
and only ten companies were still working, five of which had come under
the control of the Greenwater Death Valley Cooper Mines &amp; Smelting
Company, the large holding company. [<A HREF="notes4c.htm#8">8</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As 1908 opened, it was dearly evident that the only
hope for the Greenwater district lay in the two big mines which were
still operating, and which were going for great depths to find the ore
bodies. The Furnace Creek Copper Company, the Patsy Clark outfit, was
still sinking on its property, as was the Greenwater Death Valley Copper
Company, the main Schwab holding. Both were sinking below the five
hundred foot level, and one or the other would have to find ore soon or
Greenwater's mining history would be extremely short.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The work continued through January and February, but
with no results. By mid-February, the once-bustling Greenwater District
had shrunk to a mere shadow of its former self.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The only business establishments left in the district
were the Tonopah Lumber Company, which was still supplying timbers for
the mine shafts, two saloons, two stores and one restaurant. The total
population of the district had fallen to [about fifty souls,] and the
<U>Rhyolite Daily Bulletin</U> sadly wrote that the desert country about
Greenwater is not as abundantly prosperous as it was one short year
ago." The remaining buildings at Greenwater were already being torn down
and moved to Gold Valley, a small boom town to the south. But those
remaining at Greenwater did not give up easily. In early March a
Greenwater report stated that a spur track from the Tonopah &amp;
Tidewater Railroad would 'probably' be built into the district at an
early date, and as "soon as the building of the road is assured a great
mining boom is almost a certainty." The report went on to blame the
demise of Greenwater on the slump in copper prices worldwide, without
remembering that Greenwater had no copper to ship, regardless of
price.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Furnace Creek Copper Company and the Greenwater
Death Valley Copper Company continued to sink through April and May. S.
J. Fairbanks told the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> that "Every month or so
these companies send their experts and I understand that the
recommendations are to continue sinking. It is a well known tact that
excellent ore was discovered on the surface, and these companies are
going on the theory that depth will reveal profitable bodies."
Fairbanks, who had one of the last remaining stores in the district,
added that "These people are spending their money and taking a chance.
If they can afford to do this, I can afford to await results, since l am
making a living and then some, in the meantime." He was forced to admit,
however, that "the camp is showing small encouragement at this time.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Later in April the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> reported
again on the district. "The future of the Greenwater district depends
very largely upon the shafts which these two companies are sending down.
It is held by geologists and mineral experts that if copper deposits
exist in commercial quantities in the Greenwater district they will be
found below the water level and at great depth, and these companies have
undertaken to demonstrate the theory."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But still no ore was found, and the district
continued to decline. The <U>Greenwater Times</U> the last of the
district's newspapers, finally gave up and quit publishing shortly after
the end of May. By early June, 5. J. Fairbanks reported that "Greenwater
is only a shadow of its former self. Fairbanks had the only store and
saloon left in the district, "and the population had dwindled to almost
nothing." The only other business left in town was the Tonopah Lumber
Company, which would stay as long as the companies were sinking and
buying timbers for their shafts.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In mid-June the Greenwater Death Valley Copper
Company struck a small streak of copper ore 1,000 feet below the
surface, and mild excitement was felt again in Greenwater. Since many of
the previous claims in the district had been allowed to lapse, the news
of the strike brought some prospectors back to relocate their claims, in
case the strike turned into something big. Within a week, however, it
had proven to be only a small stringer, but even that brought out the
hopes of the faithful. Although the extent of the strike was
disappointing, the <U>Rhyolite Herald</U> reported that "the quality was
good and will no doubt lead to a larger body of ore. The existence of
ore at this depth will certainly be accepted as conclusive evidence that
Greenwater is not a surface proposition as has so often been claimed.
Despite the smallness of the strike, prospectors continued to come back
into the district to relocate their claims, just in case.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Even the mining companies were heartened by the small
strike, and as the <U>Inyo Independent</U> pointed out, "although
Greenwater is not very active at the present time . . . it is a
significant fact that the owners over there are patenting the mines and
are spending sums of money which business men are not likely to throw
away or sink in worthless ground." Closer papers, such as the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U>, were not so optimistic: "Greenwater, which once
attracted such wide attention on account of rich surface discoveries of
copper, has practically faded from the map . . ."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But such was the lingering magic of the Greenwater
name that the rumors of a new rush would not die. In mid-July, the
<U>Engineering &amp; Mining Journal</U> reported that Greenwater "is
again to the front, after being dead for many months." The Journal had
its own unique idea as to why the previous strike had not been given
much publicity, and wrote that it "was kept as quiet as possible until
the Schwab interests could secure control of contiguous territory.
Meantime there is again a rush of prospectors and others into the camp,
incited by this reported discovery." But those who returned were sorely
disappointed and soon left again, for the strike had definitely not
amounted to much. The Tonopah Lumber Company finally gave up and closed
down its Greenwater yard in late July, and by the middle of August the
<U>Bullfrog Miner</U> reported that the "town of Greenwater has but few
people left. Mr. Fairbanks himself is running the only store in
town.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The decline continued through August. The Post Office
at Greenwater was discontinued on the 15th of that month and moved to
Death Valley Junction, and Mrs. Spear, proprietor of Greenwater's last
restaurant, closed down late in the month and returned to Rhyolite. The
<U>Mining &amp; Scientific Press</U>, late in August, summed up the
results of the summer season in the district: "Greenwater is still
trying to keep itself from utter collapse . . . . Occasionally the
long-silent telephone wires to Rhyolite dropped whisperings of fancy
'strikes' at Greenwater. These found their way into print, but
Greenwater failed to sustain the promise of its earliest boom days for
anyone to take much interest in these later murmurs."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During the rest of 1908, the district was exceedingly
quiet. The Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company continued to sink in
its shaft, going deeper and deeper in the search for ore. The Furnace
Creek Copper Company did likewise, although at a slower and more
desultory pace. The Greenwater Calumet Copper Company, which had been
idle for some time, returned to perform the required annual assessment
work in the fall, and several small groups of miners and prospectors did
likewise. But as the year ended, no profitable bodies of copper ore had
been found anywhere in the district, and it was quite apparent the time
was rapidly running out for Greenwater. [<A
HREF="notes4c.htm#9">9</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Just when it seemed that Greenwater was finally dead,
another revival of hopes arose. Early in January of 1909, ore was again
found in the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company's mine, this time at
a depth of nearly 1,100 feet. The mere mention of the discovery, before
anyone knew the amount, extent or richness of the deposit, caused
another mild rush back into the district. As the <U>Rhyolite Daily
Bulletin</U> reported,</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">"Greenwater, the copper camp of the Funeral range,
has steadily advanced in its development, and is believed to be on the
verge of a boom which will eclipse its first meteoric flight. That such
a boom is imminent, and will undoubtedly come early this coming year, is
now confidently believed by those most intimate with conditions there.
As a result of this change in the feeling toward this camp, most of the
old-timers, who were first into this camp, and were most concerned with
its success, are back again, doing assessment work, relocating good
ground, and preparing fur the awakening which they say is sure to come
soon!"</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> That article, which seemed wildly extravagant when
printed in early January, began to look more realistic by the beginning
of February, when the Greenwater Death Valley Copper Company announced
the discovery of a sixty-foot ore body bearing 5 percent copper at a
depth of 1,080 feet. The <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> reporting the discovery,
remarked that the "new-old camp of Greenwater, the camp of glorious
hopes and shattered promises is again to the front in the attention of
the mining world On the proving of the new ore body depends the future
of the Greenwater Death Valley mines, and practically of the camp of
Greenwater." The news of the discovery started another small rush into
the district, several other defunct mines reopened their works, and the
population of the district soared up to 150.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Somewhere, new investors were found to back another
plunge into Greenwater stock, and such companies as Greenwater Central
Copper started work once again. Towards the end of February, as the
mini-rush continued, the <U>Bullfrog Miner</U> once again reported that
the "camp of Greenwater is on the rise from all indications. Parties
with holdings there are putting forth more zeal in the development than
has been shown for over a year."</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Developments on several properties continued through
March, with the East Greenwater Copper Company and the Greenwater
Calumet Copper Company joining the list of reactivated mines. But the
efforts were futile, and soon proved worthless. The small mines shut
down again, and in March one of the two giants gave up, when the Furnace
Creek Copper Company finally abandoned hope and ceased work. Throughout
the summer and fall of 1909 only the Greenwater Death Valley Copper
Company continued to work, and finally even that company quit in
September. The shaft was stopped at a depth of 1,439 feet, and the
papers were finally able to report for sure that Greenwater was totally
dead. As the <U>Inyo Register</U> wrote in the nature of an obituary,
with "the cessation of all work at the Greenwater Death Valley mine, the
once thriving camps of Greenwater and Furnace Creek, California, have
been given over to the reign of the coyotes. There is scarcely a man to
be found in the entire district, and locally it is considered extremely
doubtful that the Schwab company will ever resume work at the mine,
which was once pronounced a bonanza." [<A
HREF="notes4c.htm#10">10</A>]</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Greenwater was now definitely dead, and the great
boom which had propelled its name across the headlines and stock boards
of the nation was best forgotten by the thousands of investors who had
been badly burned. The <U>Mining World</U> in its annual review of
mining for 1909, summed up the demise of the once heralded district in
one short sentence: "The copper districts of the county have lapsed into
obscurity. With the final crushing of hopes, locations were abandoned,
as were titles to the once thriving business blocks of Greenwater and
Furnace, and the Inyo County papers started carrying long lists of
delinquent tax payments due from mining companies, businesses and
citizens who had once owned land in the district. The demise of
Greenwater even had a ripple effect, as Amargosa, once a lively station
on the railroad used to supply the Greenwater boom, declined by the
middle of 1910 to a population of two.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Mining was never again revived in Greenwater, and by
1917 all that a visitor could find on the spot of the town of 2,000
inhabitants was one deserted cabin. Most of the buildings at Greenwater
and Furnace were readily movable, due to the lack of permanent
construction, and most had been hauled away by their owners. What was
left had been taken by R. J. Fairbanks, the last merchant of Greenwater,
and hauled to Shoshone, a settlement on the Tonopah &amp; Tidewater
Railroad, where Fairbanks started a small store which later grew into a
thriving desert oasis.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Small attempts at sporadic production were made in
1916-1918, and again in 1929, during periods of very high copper prices,
but these efforts never amounted to more than one or two man operations,
and consisted mostly of gleaning the remains from the dumps of the old
mines and laboriously packing it out of the desert. Total production
from these activities was estimated at $10,000. During the early 1920s,
Greenwater became a favorite winter rendezvous spot for the old
desert-rats, a breed of shiftless and broken-down prospectors left over
from the Nevada boom years, who gathered there for several winters to
swap yarns about the old days, and dream their futile dreams of strikes
to come.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A rather foolish attempt was made in 1970 to revive
the Greenwater District once again, when a consortium calling itself the
Furnace Creek Copper Company (no relation to Patsy Clarks outfit)
scraped together the mining rights to a great number of claims in the
district, and even paid for a wildly optimistic mineral report on the
area. Happily, the backers of the company decided against the attempt to
resume mining. Greenwater is now totally deserted, with the exception of
occasional campers who remember the once-famous days of one of the
deserts most glorious boom districts. [<A

<P>1. <U>Greenwater Furnace and Kunze</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The main portion of the Greenwater District lies
within the boundaries of Death Valley National Monument, but due to an
odd shift of the boundary lines in this area, the very heart of the
district is outside the Monument. Thus, while the main workings of the
Furnace Creek Copper Company are within the Monument, along with its
supporting town of Furnace, the holdings of the Greenwater Death Valley
Copper Company are outside the boundary, as are the townsites of Kunze
and Greenwater.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The entire area is scattered with numerous dumps and
shafts, monuments to the futile efforts to cash in on the Greenwater
boom. The deepest of these, which belong to the Greenwater Death Valley
Copper Company, are outside the Monument, but visitors need regard
boundaries very little in this part of the country, since they are
mostly unmarked, and there is little to differ between the remains
inside and outside the Monument.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The only remains of note within the Monument are
around the site of Furnace, where several outlines of old buildings and
tentsites may be found. In addition, the dumps of various companies,
mostly noteably those of the Furnace Creek Copper company, may be seen,
as well as timbered shaft collars, loading dumps, cement hoisting
platforms, etc. There is, however, very little that can be used as
interpretive features in this section, although the forloreness of the
desert landscape emphasizes the harshness of life for those miners and
prospectors who once searched here for riches.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">To the southeast, outside the Monument boundaries,
the site of old Kunze may be located due to the remains of three stone
cabins, the ruins of several dugouts, and a scattering of old tentsites.
The physical remains here are more extensive than anywhere else in the
Greenwater district, but can rot be protected or interpreted by the
National Park Service, due to their location. Between the site of old
Kunze and Greenwater, the deepest shafts of the Greenwater Death Valley
Copper Company are found, plainly marked by the impressive size of the
dumps beside the road. Here again, however, there is little for
interpretation to focus on.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Farther to the east, where once stood Greenwater, a
maze of streets and trails may be seen cutting through the desert. Other
than that, there is almost nothing to mark the spot, for what little
remained of the site, after Fairbanks and the desert rats carted away.
the remaining buildings, has long been picked clean by more modern
tourists and souvenir hunters. Indeed, the most impressive thing about
the site of Greenwater is how the town which once boasted 2,000
inhabitants could have disappeared so utterly.</P>

<P>2. <U>Greenwater Springs</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">To the south of Greenwater is Greenwater Springs, the
obscure little water hole which gave its name to the entire district.
The area around the spring has the ruins of a stone shelter, an old mine
shaft and dump complete with concrete hoisting foundations, and several
prospect holes. At the spring itself some evidence of past attempts to
improve the flow may be seen, including some timber and concrete work
within the spring itself, and the remnants of some two-inch pipe which
formerly carried the meager flow of water to the thirsty inhabitants of
Greenwater.</P>

<P>3. <U>Coffin Mine</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">To the northwest of Greenwater, about five miles, is
the site of the abandoned 'Coffin' Mine, so named in retrospect by its
proximity to the peak of the same name. The mire's only documented claim
to fame stems from a letter reportedly written home by a young miner:
"Dear Pop, and All. Well I just came in from the Grave Yard Shift; of
the Coffin Mine, on the Death Valley Slope of the Funeral Mts. How's
that? Tragical enough?" Although this letter, which hangs in the Furnace
Creek Ranch museum, is dated 1906, there are several problems with its
authenticity. The voluminous information on the Greenwater District does
not contain any reference to a Coffin Mine; the mine itself is situated
on the Amargosa slope of the Black Mountains rather than the Death
Valley slope of the Funeral Mountains; and all the physical evidence at
the site indicates that it was a gold mining operation of a later date
than the Greenwater boom.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But whatever the origin of the letter, the Coffin
Mine has some rather typical ruins, including a shaft, some dumps and
the scattered debris of several building sites, probably bunk and cook
houses. Gasoline tins scattered around the site would seem to indicate
that this mining effort took place later than Greenwater, probably in
the 1910s or 1920s, The site itself is not very impressive, but the
isolated setting and obvious lack of civilization aptly sums up the type
of life experienced by the operators of a small time desert mine. The
Coffin Mine site does not have National Register significance, but
should be examined by a historic archaeologist.  In the meantime, benign
neglect is recommended.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> All in all, therefore, the physical remains of the
Greenwater District are not particularly noteworthy in their own regard,
and, unfortunately, the best remains of early twentieth-century ruins
are on Bureau of Land Management holdings. Nevertheless, the sheer
history of the area, even when totally unsupported by historic
structures, together with its historical archaeological values, are
enough to warrant nomination to the National Register as a Historic
District. Greenwater experienced one of the most violent and short-lived
mining booms of any mining camp in the western United States, and the
total human effort invested in its mines, coupled with the total lack of
success, has never been equaled. For a few short years, Greenwater was a
name familiar to stock brokers and mining investors from New York to San
Francisco--a name first loved, then despised. Its site deserves
recognition, protection and interpretation.</P>
