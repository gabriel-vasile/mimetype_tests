On July I, 1943, Opler an anthropologist from Cornell Universityin Ithaca, New York, was appointed as Social Science Analyst atManzanar. He served in that position until November 16, 1944, when hewas transferred to the Office of War Information in Washington, D.C. Asthe relocation center's community analyst, as he came to be known, Oplerstudied the evacuee population and advised the Project Director on the"thinking of the evacuees," recommending "courses [of action] by whichthe administrative contacts with evacuees might be shaped toward moreexpeditious acceptance of the policies of the Authority by theevacuees." According to the <I>Final Report, Manzanar,</I> Opler's"approach to his problem was historical rather than one of developmentof broad contact with current situations and the forecast of communityresponse." [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#979">79</A>] Although Opler's informantswere not necessarily "typical" evacuees or representative of the entirerange of opinions and attitudes held by the evacuee population atManzanar, they nevertheless provide a rich source of data useful inunderstanding the evacuees' prewar communities and reactions andattitudes toward the government's evacution and relocation program.Opler, unlike most WRA community analysts, adopted an adversarialposition vis-a-vis the Project Director, in this case Ralph Merritt, whowas not only opposed to having the WRA assign a community analyst toManzanar, but also attempted to have Opler dismissed from his post.While at Manzanar, Opler chose to live amoung the evacuees in theirbarracks rather than dwelling among the appointed personnel in theirupgraded quarters. In spite of having no legal training, Opler assistedin the preparation of several test cases to the government's evacuationprogram officially attributed to the work of Nisei attorneys. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#980">80</A>]</P><P>After Opler arrived at Manzanar to become the relocation center'scommunity analyst, he undertook a series of studies of economically andgeographically denned groups of persons of Japanese ancestry in thecamp. The purpose of these studies was to "throw light on the backgroundand present situation of the residents of Manzanar." According to Opler,the "time of evacuation, the manner of evacuation, the losses incurredin evacuation, the amount that has been salvaged from evacuation, thedegree of specialization involved in the type of work carried on beforeevacuation, all have much to do with present attitudes and withresistances to relocation." Bitterness often existed in proportion tothe loss, strain, and inconvenience suffered at the time of evacuation.Therefore, such studies threw "much light upon our problems, and may bea direct aid in the formulation of wise remedies and policies." Thestudies, according to Opler, also shed "some light on the history andmeaning of Manzanar as well." Thus, the studies, many of which werelightly edited versions of the evacuees' own words, provided insightinto the character of the Japanese/Japanese American communities fromwhich evacuees came to Manzanar, along with their internal rivalries,divisions, stresses, and strains, and enabled a better understanding ofthe range of resentments and reactions to evacuation that the evacueesbrought with them. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#981">81</A>]</P><P><B>Terminal Island</B></P><P>One of the first geographical groups that Opler studied, and one towhich he devoted considerable attention, was sizable contingent ofevacuees from Terminal Island. According to Opler and otherinvestigators, the Terminal Island evacuees probably suffered moreheavily in the evacuation than any other occupational or locality group.[<A HREF="hrsn.htm#982">82</A>] After conducting a number of interviewswith evacuees from Terminal Island, Opler observed on February 9,1944:</P><P>There has been much discussion, both among the evacuees and amongmembers of the appointed personnel, concerning the separatism of theTerminal Islanders. Part of the strong solidarity and in-group feelingof the Terminal Islanders is a pre-evacuation matter. They were isolatedgeographically, of course. Their vocation was a specialty and so therewas a community of work, dress and food habits that other sections ofthe Japanese population of Southern California did not share. There wereprevious ties which bound the people together too. A large percentage ofthe elders had come from Wakayama Ken in Japan and were familiar withthe fishing industry from the Orient. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#983">83</A>]</P><P>But, in addition to these pre-evacuation factors, there is the factthat the Terminal Islanders were subjected to a different treatmentduring evacuation. Evacuation orders affected them before they were feltby others, and were far more drastic in respect to them. Economic losseswere enormous. Scarcely a Terminal Island family was untouched byinternments. Hence the Terminal Islanders brought to the Center a commonfund of bitterness and an attitude of defiant hostility which stillfurther set them off from the general population at Manzanar andsomewhat repelled many of the other evacuees at first. . . .</P><P>To document "the aspect of the separatism which developed duringevacuation," Opler prepared a report, entitled 'The Terminal IslandPeople, Their Evacuation and Their Experiences at Manzanar." In hisintroductory comments, Opler observed that whether "or not some of thedescriptions are exaggerated, whether or not the grievances have grownwith repetition, the attitudes they reflect are a reality and have beensignificant for registration and other events." The report was based ona slightly edited interview with an evacuee who offered a lengthyaccount of the hardships experienced by the Terminal Islanders:</P><P>... .Of course, all of the tragedies and anxiety can not be expressedin mere words but perhaps I can give a glimpse of what occurred as ithas been related to me by approximately a dozen persons. Their stories,except in personal details, are all very similar.</P><P>The evacuee observed that Terminal Island "had over 3,000 Japaneseresidents who lived quietly and in a law abiding manner there throughthe decades." The "peace and serenity" was gone, however, after December7, 1941. That day was Sunday, a holiday, when numerous "Fish Harbor"people went to the mainland, San Pedro, to visit or to see the movies. .. . Upon hearing what had occurred that day, the aliens who tried to gethome via the ferry-boat were detained by the soldiers who took them tothe immigration station to be investigated. Even the children werequestioned. Although some persons tried to tell the soldiers that theylived on the Island, they, at first, were told to go back to San Pedrofrom where they had come. Some of the Issei had to stay overnight injail. On December 7, after dark and through the early morning of thenext day, all of the business men and a few fishermen were taken by theF.B.I.</P><P>After that day, the fishermen, both aliens and citizens, were notallowed to go out to fish. . . . The majority of the women canneryworkers were afraid to go back to their jobs, even though theircanneries asked them to return. Thus money was not made after this butwas only spent.</P><P>Because their fishing vessels lay idly anchored at the wharves, themen had to go every day to see that the boats would not become rusty orscaled with barnacles. Often these men were attacked by the Filipinos,who ganged up on them and beat them. Finally the fishermen were tooscared even to go out to see what had happened to their boats. Whilethis happened to the men, the women were often insulted by the Slavs,their former fellow cannery workers.</P><P>On Terminal Island, there is only a grammar school. To go to thesecondary schools, the students had to cross to the mainland by ferry.After the war commenced, in order to go to school, the students had toshow their birth certificates to the soldiers every day. Once thestudents were detained in the corral to the ferry-boat. The soldiersprevented them from attending school. . . . Some of the students did notattend the schools because they were afraid to leave their homes -afraid something would happen to them.</P><P>This life of terror continued for about one month. Then another blowcame. On February 2, 1942, early in the morning, all of the fishermenwere apprehended by the F.B.I. Even the bed-ridden fishermen were taken,literally dragged from their beds. . . . The F.B.I, always, it seemed,asked how much money one had in his possession. They would order thevictim to hold his hands up in the air and then would search fordifferent objects. Actually the F.B.I, acted as though they werehold-up-men. The women and children were too frightened to shed even atear. But after the men were gone and the first shock was over they wereable to cry. The fishermen were taken either to the county jail or tothe immigration station. Then later they were transferred to internmentcamps in Montana and North Dakota. As the men went to their destinationsby buses, the women and children craned their necks, trying to findtheir loved ones and to wave a brave goodbye, for they did not know whenthey would meet again.</P><P>On the following day the F.B.I., or men who pretended that they werethe F.B.I., came again to search the homes. They went through the housesfrom the roof-tops to the cellars and searched every nook and corner.They even flipped the pages of the encyclopedia, children's schoolbooks, and they also looked at the bank books. The most pitiful thingthat happened was the way the men who posed as the F.B.I., or perhapsthey may have been the F.B.I., went through the homes of the bachelorswho had been apprehended the day before. When they thought that theyweren't watched they would take money. This money was there becausethese men had been afraid to put their savings in the bank as a resultof the freezing of assets. Besides money, it was found that they alsotook other valuables. The only thing the bachelors had left were theclothes on their backs.</P><P>After the fishermen were taken, relatives and friends from SouthernCalifornia tried to see and help the women, but they were halted at thedrawbridge in San Pedro. Only the Nisei were allowed to cross thebridge. After the internment of the fishermen, the women aged greatlybecause they had to endure so much suffering and despair. . . .</P><P>The great majority of the people of Terminal Island lived in homesbuilt closely together and of the same style. These were leased from thefish canneries. It was hard on the women when the canneries asked forrent, especially when they had made no money since the beginning of thewar. There were people who did not have much to eat during those daysbecause their pride did not allow them to ask for aid. . . .</P><P>At this time, the Terminal Island branch or the J.A.C.L. (JapaneseAmerican Citizens League) had the good intention of helping the Niseiget back their old jobs of fishing, but the plans did not go through.Before long, the organization told the people that to insure theirsafety, they should wear individual snapshots and they should becomemembers of the J.A.C.L. The people trusted the organization, thereforethey did what they were told. They paid one dollar for the picture andthree dollars for the initiation fee into the J.A.C.L., which wasclaimed to be a better proof of citizenship than the birth certificate.Ironically enough, in ordinary days, the initiation fee had been onedollar.</P><P>The J.A.C.L. also charged three dollars for the service of notifyingthe Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, andthe Alien Registration Division of the change of address of an alien.This service elsewhere was conducted by the post office clerks free ofcharge. No one knew what happened to this money that was collected. . .. That is the reason so many of these Terminal Island people do not likethe group.</P><P>It was said that the Navy Department wanted to make the people moveout before February 24, but the Department did not have jurisdictionover the civilians. Therefore the Navy Department and the JusticeDepartment purchased Terminal Island from the residents, it is said. Theleases on the Island were on the month to month basis although a fewindividuals might have had longer leases which were still in effect, forleases running from 1 to 5 years had formerly been written. The HarborDepartment gave the people 30 days to evacuate after the Navy Departmentpurchased the land, but on February 25, 1942 the Navy Department orderedthe 48 hour evacuation. It came about this way.</P><P>It was February 24. The silence of the night was punctuated by sharpgunfire, the explosion of bombs, the alarm of the air raid sirens andflashes from the guns. The people of Terminal Island thought that surelythe war had commenced on the coast. Panic stricken were the people - the2,000 women and children of the Island whose fathers and husbands, 600of them, had been taken away.</P><P>The next day, February 25, after the residents spent an anxious andterrifying night, much rumor and talk was circulating. Then the SanPedro evening paper, the "New Pilot" and also the "Los Angeles Times"told of the 48 hours notice given persons of Japanese ancestry toevacuate Terminal Island. After dark, that same day, the soldiersbrought notices of evacuation to each house; they took the signatures ofthe people to make sure that they received the order. This meant thatthe people had to be off the Island by midnight, February 27. Thesuddenness of the notice to evacuate left the people numb. This cameabout a month after the men were interned. How to pack, what to pack,what to leave, what to sell? Or to get out and save your skin!Despair!</P><P>.... There were many families who were not able to pack much becauseof the lack of boxes and other things to store possessions in. Neighborscould not help each other because everyone was too busy tending to hisown packing.</P><P>The following day the junkmen swarmed over the Island. How they knewthat there would be a field day for them no one knew, but they werethere to make bargains with the evacuees, bargains that would have beenlaughed at on ordinary days. But today, any price, even thoughoutrageously low, was better than leaving the household furniture andother belongings lying in the house to be stolen. The bitter tears atseeing each dear possession sold were tragic, but this was the only way;there was no way of storing things because of the lack oftransportation. Private trucking concerns asked too much money to cartthe belongings to safety. In nearly all of the homes, after the junkmenwere gone, stood pianos, the only objects that were too heavy for thebuyers to take. . . .</P><P>.... In many cases there was not enough time for the people to sellbelongings to pack them. . . . Numerous individuals , had to sell theirworld possessions cheaply. One woman sold both her refrigerator andcooking stove for $10. She sold all of her furniture in the same tragicfashion. . . . Another lady who was considered lucky sold her piano,worth $400, for $20.</P><P>What had happened to the fishing vessels? Those, too, were sold toocheaply or were left by the people. The women did not know how to sellthe ships because their husbands, who really knew their value, weregone. Therefore they sold them at such ridiculously low prices that theycould not even cry over the loss when they realized what they haddone.</P><P>The value of the fishing vessels on the average were as follows:"jig" boats, the eight, ten, twelve horse-power boats were worth $1,000;forty horse-power boats were worth $4,000 to $5,000; and the local tunaboats were valued at $25,000. They were sold at much below these prices,depending upon the condition of the boats.</P><P>There were many petty thieves, persons who had no sense of sympathybut who took advantage of those who were being mistreated. They sneakedinto the homes from the back and took the valuables while theinhabitants were busily salvaging or selling their belongings in thefront of the house.</P><P>One woman went to the bank to draw out money. While she was gone hersewing machine and other light belongings were taken. Some of the womenwere afraid to leave their homes, therefore they put their belongingstogether so as to guard them until they were ready to leave. It was saidthat one woman worked so hard that a few days after evacuation she diedof exhaustion.</P><P>The Sugiyamas [an assumed name for one of the families] went to theBaptist Church to seek shelter and transportation. From there they,along with about sixty others, were taken to the Chuo Gakuen (CentralJapanese School) in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, California. This was oneof the shelters provided for the people by the Japanese churches andlanguage schools in Los Angeles, Compton, Torrance, and Gardena. Thepeople were divided into small groups and sent to these places. Ofcourse, there were others who rented private homes or hotel roomsbecause they wished to live near their friends or relatives. Suchpersons who did rent homes spent much money on rent and food. But thesentiment in Los Angeles County was against the evacuees, so thatlodging places were hard to rind. Those who went to live in the abovementioned shelters did get food donated by the Japanese farmers andfriends. This food the women cooked for themselves and the children.Because there were no beds, they had to sleep on the floors until theirevacuation to Manzanar.</P><P>During this period of evacuation the people were helped the most byMiss S., a Caucasian lady of the Baptist Church. This lady is lookedupon as a savior, an angel, because of her unselfishness, kindness, andhonesty. . . . The Terminal Island people will always remember her andcherish the love that she gave them. . . . The F.B.I. had her followedbecause they thought she was a suspicious character for helping theIslanders in their distress. . . .</P><P>After leaving Terminal Island and after being mistreated by theFilipinos, the Mexicans, the Slavs, the Jews, and other Caucasians, thepeople had no place to go. They lived in terror and hopeless despair forweeks. They thought they would be killed any minute and fear did much tochange their feelings towards society.</P><P>These "Fish Harbor" people were among the first family groups toarrive in Manzanar. And after they had suffered so much because of theevacuation they were due for more hardship here. The essentialfacilities of the Center were not ready. Many persons were hurt fallinginto ditches dug for pipes and stumbling over tree stumps in the dark.Added to this, the weather conditions in this desert land were notexactly morale lifting. The frequent dust storms, the sharp cold wind,the cold barrack rooms, the drab brown of the immediate surroundingsmade the people more resentful, bitter, cynical, and insecure.Everything looked so temporary here. There were no planned activitiesyet, no books to read. There were not enough jobs, no schools, nosecurity. Only boredom, and tenseness.</P><P>Energetic boys and girls with nothing to do, too restless to stayhome, would wander aimlessly about the Center and think over the 48hours evacuation, the internment of fathers, and evidences of raceprejudice to which they had been subjected. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#984">84</A>] Opler submitted a number of similar reportson the Terminal Island people based on personal interviews with evacueesat Manzanar. While each report noted unique experiences andreminiscences, they verified cumulatively the essential details of theTerminal Island evacuation that resulted in the despair,disillusionment, anger, bitterness, and resentment that characterizedthis group at Manzanar. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#985">85</A>] One reportrelated the story of a 20-year-old man on Terminal Island whoseattitudes had changed considerably as a result of the evacuation. Thereport, based on an interview with a Nisei who had become acquaintedwith the young man, stated in part;</P><P>.... Where once he was an average American-minded citizen he becamevery anti-American. Not that he would go out and blow up factories andact like a movie saboteur, but anti-American in the sense that he hadlost his faith in America. His faith and his trust. To be persecutedbecause of his ancestry and to be treated as if they were less thanhuman with no feelings was more than he and most of the others couldstand. It's hard to be treated as they were without becoming bitter. Itwould seem that his troubles were enough for so young a boy. But no, hewas sent here to camp, and his troubles seemed to just begin. . .  .</P><P>After he and his family arrived in Manzanar, most of the TerminalIsland people were housed in the same blocks, therefore they were inconstant touch with each other. He lived in the environment ofbitterness for which the Terminal Islanders were noted. They nursedtheir bitterness along, never forgetting, always remembering what theyhad and how much they lost. . . . The younger people went around in"gangs" and generally stuck with their own crowd. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#986">86</A>]</P><P>Several of Opler's reports related to the prewar reputations of theTerminal Island youth and their formation of gangs once they arrived atManzanar. The reputation of the Terminal Island youth, as well as theirgeographical isolation from the rest of the Japanese community in LosAngeles, set them apart. One Nisei, for instance, told Opler:</P><P>Before the war, Terminal Island kept pretty much within itself, ashardly any group outside of them could mingle with them.</P><P>If any visiting baseball team went to play the Island team, they weretreated very unsportsmanlike and sometimes threatened with bodily harm.This happened especially if the visiting team was ahead in the game. Sothere was an unwritten gentlemen's agreement among the various clubs inSouthland to avoid playing with the Terminal Islanders.</P><P>I heard many Nisei girls say that, "I wouldn't think of going aroundwith a Terminal Island boy." Even fellows avoided the Niseis from theisland. In fact, many fights occurred when some Terminal Island boyswent to dances in Los Angeles.</P><P>Terminal Island boys now rate pretty highly in Manzanar with thegirls as compared to before the evacuation. This is principally becausethe island teams win most of the sport contests held here. The Islanderswant to win regardless of anything. They'll threaten umpires or playersin order to win. It is a good thing to win, but it takes a lot to losein a sportsman like manner. This is not in the Terminal Island team.</P><P>Terminal Island teams would not be so strong if they had been dividedwhen evacuation started. They are the largest group of any evacues [sic]from one section.</P><P>At first, they terrorized the center in gangs. Sure, "in unity thereis strength but divided we fall," that is what Abraham Lincoln said andit seems the Terminal Island boys are applying it here. Another reasonwhy Terminal Island boys are popular with Nisei girls is that Manzanaris made up of evacuees from all parts of California. There is the Floringroup from the North West Los Angeles, Venice, Glendale, San Fernando,and very few from Los Angeles proper. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#987">87</A>]</P><P>Some youth from Terminal Island formed "Zoot suit" gangs at Manzanaras an expression of their rebellion. Zoot suit gangs originated amongMexican and black young men in Los Angeles during the prewar years, butthey also became popular among some Japanese (particularly on TerminalIsland and in Little Tokyo) and Filipinos. The gangs were characterizedby long hair, exaggerated baggy clothing, and use of unique slang. OneNisei informed Opler that such gangs became popular among the TerminalIslanders at Manzanar:</P><P>The Japanese that copied the zoot suits frequented the 'Lil' Tokyo'streets. I believe the Exclusive Twenty Club boys were the earliest[Japanese] groups to wear zoot suits. The Dunbar boys were next inwearing those styles.</P><P>After evacuation, the Exclusive Twenty Club was scattered in variouscenters, but the clothes that they wore took hold in various centers,especially in the Manzanar Center. The Terminal Island Niseis went forthe zoot suit styles in a big way. They draped all kinds of pants toconform with the style. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#988">88</A>]</P><P>Gangs, such as the Dunbar Boys, would cause considerable trouble toWRA officials at Manzanar, particularly during the camp's first year ofoperation.</P><P><B>Little Tokyo &#151; East Los Angeles</B></P><P>Opler also compiled a series of studies on the experiences andattitudes of evacuees at Manzanar that had come from the LittleTokyo-East Los Angeles area. In one report, dated October 26, 1943,Opler interviewed a Nisei mother who characterized herself as "anaverage Nisei . . . woman, 25, married, with a four year old daughter."Her father was an Issei, and her mother was a Nisei, but she consideredherself a Nisei. She observed that her story was "like hundreds of otherNisei girls, with slight variations:"</P><P>.... I was brought up from the time I was about 3 or 4 until my teensby Caucasian Nuns (Catholic, my mother was a Catholic, and so are we)because Mother died, and left Father with a good-sized family (seven ofus), ranging from less than a year to about 10, whom he could not takecare of and support at the same time. Therefore, my background fromchildhood was strictly American, with no Japanese customs andrestrictions. ... I went to the grammar school the Nuns conducted, thenon to the public high school. I graduated from Los Angeles High Schoolin Los Angeles, with neither high honors, nor, on the other hand, at thefoot of the class, but just as one of 500 or so other students, readyand eager to go into the world to make use of the high ideals andteachings we had received.</P><P>Eight months or so after graduation, I met and married another'nisei' from Florin. ... He had come to Los Angeles when he was 19 toestablish a wholesale fruit and vegetable business. When I met him hewas 24 years old, and already quite established in his business, throughfour years of hard work. We were married and a year later our daughterwas born. About this time he felt that he could expand his business, sowith more heart-breaking work and sacrifice, he was reallyestablished.</P><P>Now, we were really well situated and settled, even according toAmerican standards. We lived in a nice home, had a new car, and agrowing business, with enough money for the necessities of life with afew luxuries added, but not enough to squander foolishly. . . . now thatI was married, and had a beautiful daughter, and a young, ambitious andfairly successful husband, I for once felt the sense of security, loveand protection that I had been unconsciously longing for. As our second,and third years of marriage came and went, my husbands' business becamebetter and better and he had big plans for future operations, when&#151; bang &#151; all of a sudden &#151; Pearl Harbor &#151; and thesmashing of all our hopes and dreams.</P><P>The nisei evacuee reflected on the impact of Pearl Harbor andevacuation:</P><P>One cannot imagine the bitter despair and unhappiness of those firstdays and weeks. People, ignorant people, instead of letting us lick ourwounds in peace, knocking at our door, asking if we had anything tosell, cheap, as if we were junk men or something, trampling, andhandling our belongings as if we had no feelings at all. . . . Thehumiliation and degradation of those days will never leave us. ... Isometimes thought I could not stand the heartbreak in my husbands' eyes.Ten years of blood and sweat went into his business, and he was justabout ready to sit back, and ease up a little, to enjoy his well earnedfruits, when he had to give up and sell out. . . .</P><P>When evacuation came, and things were in such a confused state, andwe were in a panic, we thought it best to get rid of her [theirdaughter's] furniture, as we thought we could not take it along with us.We sold it for a song. . . .</P><P>The greatest blow to her was when we were forced to give away all hertoys. I didn't want to sell them, so I just gave them away to theneighbor children. . . .</P><P>Maybe these are little things compared to many which have happened,the heartache and misery, the thousands on thousands of dollars whichwere lost through evacuation, but the little things piled on each other,day by day, caused more heartbreak in us, then the one clean break ofevacuation. Evacuation, on the whole, was a big, stunning blow thatnumbed us. But when we recovered from the shock we were actually incamp, learning to take it as a matter of course. But it is these littleirritations, constantly chafing us, that keep us a little bitter, with asense of frustration. . . .</P><P>.... On the whole, most of us took it [evacuation] as a matter ofcourse; we were neither too bitter nor too happy about the whole affair.I think some of us</P><P>(especially those of us who came from the Los Angeles area and theimmediately surrounding towns) were a little relieved to be away fromthe minor irritations, i.e., insults and slander, and the smallhumiliations unthinking people heaped upon us after Pearl Harbor. . ..</P><P>Not only were things like that common occurrences, but we had to takebeing refused a ride on the street car by the conductor, who in normaltimes wouldn't have thought to insult us so openly. . . .</P><P>Not only were we afraid for ourselves, but for our children,husbands, and parents. Personally, I always thought I could take care ofmyself when such things came up, as I am completely Americanized, andcan give tit for tat, but when your children and especially our parents(most of whom are law-abiding, unassuming people, who could notunderstand why they were spoken to and insulted the way they were, butjust took it in silence) were made miserable and unhappy, I think manyof us tried to act as a buffer for them, so that they might be a littlemore relieved in a situation which was no fault of theirs nor, as amatter of fact, any fault of ours. The Nisei mother observed that many"of us will not have any more children for some time, as under thecircumstances, when we have no home to go to, no real security, nor theatmosphere of safety in which normal happy children should be broughtup, we feel it is best not to bring any more into the world." Sheelaborated:</P><P>.... Many will say, there's nothing to prevent you from having one,as there are hospital accommodations, etc. at the camp. Yes, I admitthat. Excellent accommodations, in fact, but how many of us would careto go through life having to admit we were born in a "concentrationcamp". I know they are called 'relocation centers,' but in actuality,they <u>are</u> concentration camps. I, myself, would rather not haveanother child if it had to be born in camp. I'd much rather wait until Iam out again, free, and on my own, settled in a community ofunderstanding and sympathetic Americans, to bring up my family in anatmosphere of trustfulness and love, and free of the prejudices and hatethat we have known. Maybe I am being idealistic, but no matter how hardhit and bitter we were about evacuation, our ingrown American teachingsand traditions were never downed.</P><P>Despite her disillusionment and frustration, the Nisei evacueereflected on her continuing loyalty to the United States. Noting thatloyalty had never been an issue for her, she stated:</P><P>.... America is the land of my birth, the only land I know, I havenever been in Japan, nor have I had any desire to go; I feel I belonghere, and here I wish to remain. You don't stop loving your father if hegives you a sound thrashing for something that wasn't your fault. Youadmit it was wrong and try to forgive him. So it is with most of us. Wethink evacuation wasn't the solution to the problem, but as long as theAdministration thought it was best, we have tried to understand and takeit, and when the time comes for our release, we shall try to pick up thethreads of our former life and live in the true American traditions, andbring up our children, too, on these same traditions, of justice,equality and the pursuit of happiness. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#989">89</A>]</P><P>Opler prepared a second report based on an autobiographical sketchwith this Nisei woman. In this sketch of her experiences, she relatedhow she and her husband had arrived at Manzanar and discussed thequandaries in her mind as to the meaning of evacuation. Prior to thewar, she observed that their lives were "set in a complete pattern."</P><P>Then suddenly and shockingly, without any notice, the war started.Things were in a confused state. People were becoming panicky. There wastalk of evacuating all Japanese out of the state. I hoped and prayed weat least &#151; as citizens, would be allowed to remain. But to noavail. My husband sold his business while the selling was good. Whenevacuation was confirmed, we decided to move north to the so-called'white (free) zone.' But even there we were not allowed to stay inpeace. We were ordered to evacuate to the Tale Lake center. While wewere there, my husband went to the Montana Sugar Beet fields onfurlough. Returning to camp he decided he would go out again in thespring and stay 6 or 7 months. I decided to apply for transfer to theManzanar Center where my folks were, since I had no relatives or friendsin Tale. My transfer was recommended, and I reached Manzanar early inthe spring. . . .</P><P>After being at Manzanar for two years, this Nisei motherobserved:</P><P>I often sit and wonder how I ever came to be in a camp full ofJapanese, aliens and citizens alike, with nothing much in common betweenthem and myself except the color of our skins. What had I, or as amatter of fact, what had the rest of them done, to be thrown in camp,away from familiar surroundings, and familiar faces? What had there beenin my life that made such a thing happen? I suppose the only answer is,the accident of my birth &#151; my ancestry. There is no other logicalanswer. . . .</P><P>.... So we are looking forward to that day when we will again be'free citizens' and lead once more a normal life. Maybe some day I maybe able to find an answer to why we were put in camps. Even now I canfind no answer, no event in my life to make me realize WHY? [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#990">90</A>]</P><P>Opler gathered other stories of arbitrary treatment anddiscrimination encountered by evacuees from the Little Tokyo-East LosAngeles area that contributed to the anger and bitterness of thosepeople. On April 24, 1944, he prepared an account of a Nisei who hadgrown up in Fresno where his father's laundry business was located in"Chinatown." Because 90 percent of his father's business came from"Chinese," it "hit rock bottom" in 1931 when "Japan started the waragainst China and took over Manchuria." The Chinese tongs in Fresno"forbade any dealing with Japanese."</P><P>Because his mother had a cousin living in Los Angeles, he"hitch-hiked" to the city, "getting a ride with a produce truck." Thecousin found him a job "in a retail produce market as an apprentice witha salary of sixty dollars a month, room and board." Within six months hehad "saved over two hundred dollars," so he sent for his parents andbrothers. The family rented a house near the wholesale producemarkets.</P><P>The Nisei man encountered racial slurs and slights as he worked inLos Angeles during the 1930s. He remembered being called a "Jap" andbeing told to go back where he came from. He observed:</P><P>When someone said something like this it sure used to get my bloodboiling as I didn't know how to speak Japanese enough to be called a"Jap." I resented it very much as I thought I was as good as any otherAmerican citizen.</P><P>In time I got used to being called a 'Jap' by some 'ignorant whites.'I realized that if a I argued every time with ornery customers when Iwas called names, there wouldn't be much business left, so I learned tocontrol my temper.</P><P>Things were pretty tough in Los Angeles during the years 1932 to1934, but we managed [to] live by the skin of our teeth.</P><P>I wanted to go to college and take up law but my obligation to helpthe family was stronger so I remained working. My father wanted us tostart some kind of a business of our own, but somehow we could never getenough capital to start a business. I learned through my associationswith fellow fruit-stand workers that speaking English only was ahandicap in getting better wages and good jobs.</P><P>I tried to get jobs with American concerns but found that onlyjanitorial jobs were open and some concerns said right out that they'had nothing for Japs'. . . . This kind of treatment jolted my idealsand so I took to learning to speak Japanese in earnest. Now I speakJapanese pretty well for I have really applied myself to it. In fact, Iworked on it so hard that I believe my English slipped back.</P><P>Although the account did not discuss the Nisei's experiences in thelate 1930s and at the time of evacuation, Opler noted in the foreword ofthe report that in 1939 the young man was able to found a business ofhis own, and it too, collapsed at evacuation. At the Project [Manzanar]the young man has been restless, volatile and unstable. He has sampledwork in almost every Department of the Center. It is possible that hisdisorganization has gone too far, and that what he seeks is behind, andnot before him. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#991">91</A>]</P><P>Several other reports prepared by Opler illustrated thediscriminatory and brutal treatment experienced by evacuees in theLittle Tokyo-East Los Angeles area that contributed to their anger,bitterness, and anti-social behavior at Manzanar. One report, entitled"Arbitrary Treatment by F. B. I. Men," was related by an evacuee who wasa friend of two Nisei and one Issei from Little Tokyo. The reportstated:</P><P>It was the night of December seventh 1941 in the LIL' TOKYO sectionof Los Angeles. Three Japanese fellows were walking home from Broadwaywhen they were stopped by four F.B.I., agents who got out of a sedan.This happened between Los Angeles and San Pedro streets on East Firststreet. The F.B.I. men asked the trio what nationality they were&#151;whether they were Chinese or Japanese. They asked them what they weredoing out so late at night. It was only 9:30 P.M. and the men werenearly home. There were no curfew laws in effect yet. When they repliedthat they were Japanese, the F.B.I, men told the trio to get inside thecar or they would be black-jacked. The trio didn't have any alternativeother than to comply. After the trio got into the car, they were drivento an empty auto-park behind the Paris Inn Cafe. Then the Japanese boyswere told to get out. They did so and then the F.B.I, men beat the holyday-lights out of them. One of the G-men told the trio to make a run forit, all the while holding onto his hip-pocket as though getting ready todraw his gun out. The trio refused to run away so then they were takento Central Jail. There again the fellows were subjected to furtherpunishment until one of the policemen interfered, telling the G-men thatthey had enough beatings already.</P><P>The trio were later transferred to Lincoln Heights jail to be bookedon some trumped up charge about late hours or something. Their trialcame up about a week later and when it did they were dismissedimmediately. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#992">92</A>]</P><P>Two reports by Opler linked the discrimination experienced byJapanese in the Little Tokyo-East Los Angeles area with the rise of zootsuit gangs in those sections of the city. One report, as previouslynoted, indicated that the "Japanese that copied the zoot suitsfrequented the 'Lil' Tokyo streets." [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#993">93</A>]</P><P>Another report prepared by Opler related the story of a young manfrom the Little Tokyo-East Los Angeles area who had become a gang memberat Manzanar, in part because of the chaos and turmoil he had experiencedduring the evacuation. An evacuee who had known the young man for sometime told Opler:</P><P>One boy, a neighbor here, is a good example of what the 'zoot suits'have done to him. He is a member of one of the more 'famous' gangs ofManzanar.</P><P>In Los Angeles, where he was born and raised until evacuation, he wasmore than a model boy and son. He was the oldest boy in a family of twoboys and two girls. He was a hard working fellow helping his father, whoowned a wholesale produce firm in the Los Angeles market. Working as anall-around man, he sold, bought and received the produce. At that timehe was about 20 years of age and the pride of his dad. He knew that byworking hard he not only helped his dad, but himself at the same time,for he was learning the business inside out and preparing for the daywhen he might have to run it himself. He was an extremely ambitious boy.He actually never went out with a girl, which is in itself amazing, forhe was twenty, a city boy and not too poor. But he just was 'toobusy.'</P><P>After evacuation, when he landed in camp he seemed to becomecompletely different. Not that he became vicious or bad, but from aquiet, conservative boy, he really became a model 'pachuco' boy, withhaircut, clothes and talk of the zoot suit gang. He let his hair growalmost to his shoulder, cut in that exaggerated fashion of the truepachuco. All his clothes, both work clothes and good clothes were cut inthe zoot drape. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#994">94</A>]</P><P><B>West Los Angeles</B></P><P>Opler prepared several reports describing the experiences andattitudes of evacuees at Manzanar from the West Los Angeles area. Onereport was based on an interview with a Nisei who had been born andraised in Hawaii. After graduating from high school this man had movedto northern California where he worked as a farm laborer. Several yearslater, he migrated to West Los Angeles and became a gardener. The reportstated:</P><P>He was doing better than average in making a living and by this timehe was married and had a son. His wife was a proprietress of a beautyshop in West Los Angeles and things were going along very smooth untilthe notice of evacuation. . . .</P><P>According to Opler, this Nisei</P><P>never realized that the United States government would allow suchabridgement of citizenship rights of Niseis. This fellow was totallyAmericanized so he couldn't think that the Army could make us evacuate.Later he thought that the United States government would pay indemnityto evacuees for property losses. But when he finally realized that theretribution wasn't going to be paid to evacuees, he became prettybitter.</P><P>He said the Army didn't even give the Niseis a chance to show theirloyalty to this country, instead they shoved us in here [Manzanar]. Thisman also remarked that prior to evacuation he was willing to fight forthis country, but not any more. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#995">95</A>]</P><P><B>Venice</B></P><P>At least four of Opler's reports were devoted to the study of Venice,a truck farming community near the coast south and west of Los AngelesCity from which many evacuees at Manzanar originated. The mostcomprehensive report relating to this area, entitled "Mr. O., A Farmerfrom Venice, California (By an Evacuee Research Assistant)," wasprepared on August 24, 1944. In his introductory comments, Oplerobserved that this account was "in part autobiographical, in part amirror of a region and of a section of the West Coast population ofJapanese ancestry before and during evacuation." It was "the story of anindividual whom we shall call Mr. O., a successful farmer of the Venice,California area." The materials presented "were obtained in the courseof a number of interviews with Mr. O. After the various interviews wereorganized and paraphrased, the data was submitted "to the narrator forcomment and correction."</P><P>The report included Mr. O's impressions as he and his family leftVenice for Manzanar on April 27, 1942. The evacuation experience was"like sinking down to the gloomy, colorless abyss of a foggy, dampmorning." He related further:</P><P>.... One by one the buses, filled with heartsick, discouraged andhumiliated evacuees, rolled away. The occupants craned their necks tosee their homes, perhaps for the last time. All the energy used to buildup what they had simply disappeared like a mirage in the cloud of dustand the carbon monoxide of the buses. ...</P><P>The evacuees who arrived [at Manzanar] on Sunday, Monday, andTuesday, April 26, 27, and 28, 1942, came from the Santa Monica bayarea, Sawtelle, San Fernando Valley, Burbank and Glendale. . . . Afterengine trouble and a flat tire, Mr. O's group arrived, only to be met bya famous Manzanar dust storm. Anguished tears stung their eyes as theythought, 'Haven't we gone through enough without having to face thistoo?'</P><P>Mr. O.'s father had emigrated to the United States via San Franciscoin 1907. After meandering throughout the western states, he returned toJapan to attend to a family emergency. After marrying, he returned toAmerica in 1911, and the family, which now included a baby daughter,settled in Elysian Park, a spinach-growing area on the north side ofcentral Los Angeles where Mr. O. was born the following year. During themid-1920s the family had moved to the Venice area and established atruck farming enterprise. The account of Mr. O.'s prewar experiencescontinued:</P><P>The oldest son, Mr. O., took over the family farm when he was 16years of age. Luck was with the family, for in 1929 they hit the'jack-pot,' &#151; they had an exceptionally good year. From then on,farming was easier. Young Mr. O. says he could not claim to be aseasoned farmer until he was 21 years of age. Before evacuation, he hadtwenty acres of land, leased, which was yielding on the average fromthree to four car loads of celery an acre or sixty to seventy car loadsa year. This does not include other crops. One refrigerated car carried340 crates, the half-crate type, field packed.</P><P>He specialized in celery raising from 1926 to 1942. His twenty acresof it brought him $16,000 to $18,000 gross per year.</P><P>During his Venice High School years, his ambition was to become adoctor of medicine. He majored in mathematics and foreign languages.Since his father could not work as he used to, Mr. O. had to take allthe responsibilities of the family onto his young shoulders. So hisdreams of becoming a doctor faded. Instead, he sent his younger brotherto a medical college. . . .</P><P>Mr. O is now 32 years of age. He has an attractive wife and threechildren. He met his wife, a Kibei, in Ise, Japan, on one of his threevisits to that country.</P><P>Mr. O. was one of the oldest Nisei farmers in the Venice district,though there were a few Kibei farmers who were near his age. All theNisei seemed to prefer white collar jobs. ... He says, The Californiansshould not be afraid that the persons of Japanese ancestry are going tobe tough competitors in the field of agriculture, because even beforethe war, the Nisei were leaving the farms for the city. The Issei,because of the lack of education, did not go into business, but chosethe farm, the back-breaking manual labor. The Nisei have seen the worktheir folks have gone through, and they do not wish to go through thesame thing. The younger generation prefers the easier and cleanerjobs.'</P><P>Concerning activities in Venice prior to the war, the reportstated:</P><P>.... everybody was busy all the time; there just did not seem to bemuch time for leisure. Mr. O. did belong to the Young Men's Associationand was at one time a cabinet member of this organization composed ofpersons of Japanese ancestry. He, also, was a member of the Judoclub.</P><P>There were yearly prefecture picnics, as well as picnics with thePacific Fruit and Produce Company employees (Caucasians) and the farmersof Japanese ancestry in Southern California. This was a bright and trueway for better racial understanding.</P><P>In answer to charges that the Japanese farmers exploited Mexicanlaborers in the Venice area, the report noted:</P><P>All the Mexican laborers who were hired to work on the variousranches in California were members of the Mexican Union. If the wageswere low, they would strike. The Mexican consul would help them. It hasbeen charged often that the Japanese people always were close to theirconsulate, but the Issei had to have some group to look after theirrights since they could not become citizens of this country.</P><P>It is understood that the Japanese never took unfair advantage of theMexican laborers. Wages paid during the pre-evacuation days were $.50per hour; now they are probably $.85 per hour.</P><P>The report described the financial condition of the Venice farmers atthe time of evacuation:</P><P>At times when the celery crop was good, the people in the Venice areawere swamped with salesmen from various companies. In those years, theybought the best and most modern kitchen equipment, household furnitureand nice automobiles. For an example, in 1941, luck was with them. In acompetitive spirit, all the neighbors bought new 1941 Pontiacs,Chryslers, Fords, and Buicks. Everyone tried to out-do the other fellow.And when there were picnics, rows of shining new automobiles with windowlicense stickers still on were to be seen.</P><P>Also new tractors and farm equipment were bought. Everything wasperfect. Although the homes looked shabby from the outside, thiscontrasted sharply with the interiors. Money was not spent on theoutside of the houses because the places were rented, and the tenantsnever knew when the landlords would decide to sell out. If they, theIssei, had been able to buy land, then naturally the exteriors of thehomes would have been made more presentable. . . .</P><P>The "good times," however, came to an end with the coming of war. Thereport discussed this chaotic period:</P><P>When war was declared all the leaders of the Venice district: wereinterned; the Japanese language school teachers and the Japanese schoolcommittee members as well as those who were members of the JapaneseAssociation. . . .</P><P>.... much hardship was suffered by the Venice farmer when the fivemile travel limit and the curfew were enforced. Whenever he had anybusiness to do, he had to go to the local WCCA office or the policedepartment for a travel permit. To get this, he had to wait in line,because there were many other persons who also wished to travel.Therefore he had to do his business the next day. This took much timeand spoiled many business opportunities. The distance from Venice to LosAngeles is sixteen miles.</P><P>There had been so much talk of evacuation that the aliens were, in ahazy way, expecting it. But the citizens [Nisei] of the Venice areanever thought for one instant that they would be evacuated too.</P><P>Mr, O. is a citizen, and he never met discrimination whatsoever inhis line of work. He was confident that he would be allowed to stay. Hadhe not been deferred from selective service because he was an essentialfarmer? Because he was so optimistic, he put in much time, labor andmoney so that he would be able to harvest and work his land for theduration. Thus, he lost his money. He was too confident of his rights asa citizen.</P><P>Mr. O.'s optimism was based, in part, on a letter that he hadreceived from the Defense Board of the U.S. Department of Agriculture inLos Angeles on March 16, 1942. The letter stated that "the best possibleevidence of the loyalty of Japanese persons to this country . . . isthat they continue their farming operations." Opler's reportcontinued:</P><P>This . . . letter . . . supposedly answered Mr. O.'s question of whatto do with his crops as evacuation became imminent.</P><P>He received this letter and heard from the neighbors that they, too,were told that they would be considered saboteurs if they did not put intheir money and make preparations to harvest the crops even though theywould not be there to benefit from them. This furthered the feeling ofunrest. If the fields were neglected, it was said the FBI would come andtake them to jail. Of course, this frightened the farmers, for peoplewere actually being picked up by the FBI constantly in the community forvarious minor reasons after the outbreak of war.</P><P>In March, 1942, when Mr. O. asked the Federal Reserve Bank of SanFrancisco what to do with the farm equipment he was purchasing on aninstallment plan, the reply was that he should make suitablearrangements with the dealers who had sold the machines to him.</P><P>One of the tractor company dealers said, 'We don't know whether youJap boys will pay or not. You are going to a concentration camp. Wedon't consider people who go in there citizens of this state. So paynow; I can't tell if you will be able to later on.'</P><P>The tractors had to be stored in the company's garage. Mr. O.'sbrother lost his tractor, even though payment for it was not due. Mr.O.'s bill for his tractor was not due until June of the following yearbut he still had to pay for it then. He had hoped for a moratorium.</P><P>A group of Venice men finally asked a lawyer to draw up a petition toGeneral DeWitt asking permission to stay a little longer than the timeset for their evacuation, so that they might harvest the celery. ButDeWitt did not even answer them. The farmers had to put in money to keepthe farms going until the day of evacuation. They had to put up allordinary costs, about $600 at the minimum per acre. .. .</P><P>Meanwhile, the Venice truck farmers were trying to sell their cropsas the time of evacuation drew closer. The report stated:</P><P>.... as the evacuation day grew nearer, people who were panicstricken harvested their crops early and took them to the markets at thesame time. The markets were flooded with stock. Naturally the priceswent down drastically. In April Mr. O. was able to sell the crops byhimself, but one of the reliable companies signed a contract with him toharvest the crops in May and June. . . .</P><P>Because the evacuees were anxious to get rid of whatever they had,they sold cheaply or else lent farming equipment, land, or crops totheir neighbors or other Caucasian farmers. The evacuees, it seemed, hadlost all sense of balance. . . .</P><P>While at Manzanar, Mr. O., as well as many other farmers, wereangered by enactment of the Lowrey Bill, signed into law on May 18,1943, by Governor Earl Warren. The law authorized the seizure of idleJapanese-owned farm machinery by the government for agricultural use.Some Caucasians who had taken over the Japanese-operated farms andstored Japanese-owned equipment reported the idle farm implements andmachinery to authorities. Thus, many of the evacuee farmers were forcedto sell or to run the risk of having their equipment seized. Mr. O."decided that it would be better to sell his equipment, no matter howcheaply, than to have it seized." Accordingly, Mr. O. sold hisequipment, despite his desire to keep and use them when he relocated.The report described the equipment and buildings that Mr. O. was forcedto sell while interned at Manzanar:</P><P>Approximately 3800 nursery flats and 25 larger items were sold. Someof the more valuable items were as follows: one Chevrolet, 1939, 11/2ton truck; one, 1940 Pontiac; one Farmall model 1941, cultivator; oneHardie High pressure sprayer, 1941 model; one caterpillar tractor, 1941;one John Deere plow, 1941 (late); one John Deere Disc, 1941; Landleveler, 1939; two hot houses with a capacity of 2200 flats each; twoliving houses; one garage; one barn; and one tool house.</P><P>The report stated that the Lowrey Bill "was a great blow in manyways." It worked against the plans of the government, which was to getthe evacuees [out of the relocation centers] and back to productive lifeagain. This bill came at a time when plans to relocate were being madeby farmers. The farmers do not wish to go out as common laborers. Theydesire to run their own farms as before. This bill, as well as thenewspaper propaganda that went with it, led to a great deal ofbitterness. A good many of the evacuees who were not farming alsoreacted to the harshness and cruelty of the Lowrey Bill and to theviciousness of the newspaper articles [associated with its passage]. Thepeople felt persecuted. Farmers who lost their equipment abandoned plansfor relocation. [<A HREF="hrsn.htm#996">96</A>]</P><P>Several other reports prepared by Opler indicate the level of angerand bitterness on the part of many evacuees from the Venice area. Onereport, entitled "The Venice Niseis (From a Los Angeles Nisei),"stated:</P><P>The Niseis of Venice region were very much urbanized, consideringthat they lived in rural homes. Most of them spoke good English andmingled with the Caucasian children. Majority of them were soAmericanized that their parents could not tell them what to do. TheNiseis would argue back, saying that it's old fashioned to do things theJapanese way. Venice farmers were better off from the financialstandpoint as compared to average farmers.</P><P>When the war broke out, the Niseis also were prevented from goinganyplace, anytime, and they were not allowed to have in their possessioncameras or firearms. In other words, the same restrictions placed on theenemy aliens were applied to the Niseis as well.</P><P>After being placed in a evacuation center, the Niseis were ridiculedas to their status as United States citizens. They were reminded thatthey were in the same boat with aliens and that their citizenship haddone them no good. Most of these Niseis resent the fact that theircitizenship rights were taken away. The fact that they were soAmericanized and yet were suddenly placed in the category of aliens, andbeing constantly reminded of this by the elders made them pretty bitter.[<A HREF="hrsn.htm#997">97</A>]</P><P><B>Pasadena</B></P><P>Opler prepared a report on the impact of evacuation as reported by aNisei gardener in Pasadena, a suburb northeast of Los Angeles. TheNisei, who lived with his wife and two-year-old son, noted that he wastelling his story "to explain what my family and I went through duringthat critical time." The report stated:</P><P>At the out-break of war, some people were kind and some as ornery ascould be. I had a Caucasian friend, a woman, who insisted that I remainput instead of voluntarily evacuating. My younger brother hadvolunteered to go to Manzanar on March 23rd, 1942 to help prepare thecamp for later evacuees.</P><P>My older brother was working in a large American vegetable store inAlhambra [a suburb near Pasadena] when the restriction for traveling anydistance was placed on people of Japanese ancestry. The distance fromPasadena to the store was just about five miles, maybe a little over, sohe kept on his job, but when the curfew law was put in effect, he had toquit his job, as he was working nights only.</P><P>Now I was the only one working and 1 was not earning enough tosupport any large number of persons. So my only recourse was to evacuatewith the rest of the family to Manzanar.</P><P>I went to the Los Angeles induction station to get necessaryinformation regarding evacuation. This was at Seventh and SpringStreets. I wanted to find out if I could bring my radio, beds, andcountless other appliances for daily use. The people working therepassed the buck to each other in giving out information regarding thingslike that. They said that I could bring whatever I could carry. Now thisdidn't clarify my mission so I asked them to define 'all I can carry.'They said, 'Just what it means is all the explanation that isnecessary.'</P><P>Now, I couldn't carry much nor could I expect my wife or son to carryanything. My wife was in a family way, so I devised ways and means tocarry as much as possible.</P><P>The American lady friend offered to store some things until such timeas they could be called for, so part of my problem was solved. Somethings which we did not consider worthwhile storing we sold or gaveaway, such as projection films, music sheets, buckets, clothes-pins,pictures of Japan, some cooking utensils and countless other things thatare used daily in average American homes.</P><P>April the second was the date set for us to evacuate to Manzanar. Imade a contraption whereby I could pull a heavy load, carry the beddingson my back, and at the same time carry two suitcases on each side. Thecontraption was a 2-wheel, sledlike trailer and I expected to carry abig bundle on it. My wife was to carry a small suit case and my son wasto carry a shopping bag filled with light things.</P><P>I will never forget the scene at the railroad station when I went toload our things on. Why, there were sewing machines and trunks and allsorts of bundles that a single person could not possibly carry byhimself. It sure made me sore to see things like that. Maybe I trustedthe government employees at the induction station too much. When Ithought of the things I had thrown away I sure was sore. It took me agood 6 months to forget this.</P><P>This mass evacuation was handled in an orderly way, but what theevacuees suffered in property losses and rights can never be quiteforgotten.</P><P>I personally thought, as my Caucasian friend did, that we Niseis withcitizenship would be out of the center within half-a-year. That kind ofthinking probably made me sell and throw away a lot of things. Iexpected to go right back to Pasadena and work as a gardener. I sure wasan optimist then but now I know better. [<AHREF="hrsn.htm#998">98</A>]</P><P><B>Burbank</B></P><P>On December 14, 1943, Opler prepared a report based on an interviewwith a young Nisei adult who lived with her mother and younger brotherin Burbank, a suburban community north of Los Angeles in the SanFernando Valley, at the time they were evacuated to Manzanar on April28, 1942. The family lived on a small estate owned by an upper middleclass family where the interviewee's now deceased father and mother hadsettled in 1921 as caretakers. In addition, the parents had establisheda small flower enterprise, renting several acres on the estate on whichto raise the flowers.</P><P>The interviewee described her school experiences in Burbank:</P><P>Going to school was something which I have always liked. I know thatI was very happy going to school for thirteen years; kindergarten,grammar school, junior and senior high school. . . .</P><P>For junior high school graduation, I was selected as one of the fivespeakers. . . .</P><P>While in high school, I was a member of the scholarship society, andthe exploration club. We had our parties, conferences, and trips. . . Ithink I led a very normal American girl's life. . . .</P><P>Although I heard that discrimination and prejudice existed, I neverencountered them during my school years. My friends always treated me asan equal so that I always had a good time. . . .</P><P>The evacuee described her experiences after Pearl Harbor. On December8, 1941, she and her brother went to school "with some anxiety." Sheobserved:</P><P>.... Instead of ill treatment, there seemed to be a closer and moreunderstanding feeling between us and the other students. On that day,the principal of the school spoke in assembly, telling the student bodynot to molest persons of Japanese ancestry. I was glad and grateful thathe did but I don't think anyone would have done anything cheap towardsus. After that day, all the days seemed to be the same. On occasionssome people would look at us in a queer way but that would be all.</P><P>The evacuee described the fear that her family experienced as theyread newspaper stories of Japanese persons being killed by Filipinos inStockton and of the Terminal Island evacuation. "We wished that we coulddo something for them, but what?"</P><P>The evacuee also described the feelings of denial, helplessness, andfear experienced by her family as evacuation day for her communityapproached. She noted:</P><P>.... As the evacuation areas were being planned we thought that sincewe lived so far from the coast line we would not be evacuated. And inthe first place, we smugly thought, the Caucasians would know that wewouldn't want to do any sabotage or espionage. In the first place, how,even if we had such ideas, could we get away with such a thing? Ourcomplexions would give us away immediately. If we were white then maybesuch a thing would be possible.</P><P>Alas, we learned that we were in the restricted zone. The voluntaryevacuation was stopped and the curfew laws were enforced. All duringthis period and the weeks that followed, there was much emotionalupheaval. The anxiety of not knowing what was going to happen next wasoppressive. We were always in fear and felt like hunted animals or likeescaped convicts. . . .</P><P>Before long, notices were posted and newspapers gave the completerestricted zones. We found that we had to move to Manzanar. We were toldthat we would be allowed to take only as much as we were able to carrywith us. We, and I know many other families too, packed only enough tolast for the summer and early autumn of the first year. Somehow winterweather was forgotten in the hustle and mad cap way of packing. Everyonefelt that he would be lucky if he got away with his life. Thereforepacking was done in a rather crazy, absent-minded fashion. Allselfishness and personal thoughts were forgotten. We felt as though wewere going to another world. People sold their belongings atoutrageously low prices unthinkingly and some persons simply left theirrefrigerators, stoves, and valuable belongings standing. When personsstored their things in the churches and temples, they probably thoughtthat they would be as well protected there as in any other place. As youhave undoubtedly seen in the newspapers, vandals have stolen ordestroyed much of the stored goods left in these places. Some Caucasiansdid travel from door to door, asking if anything was for sale. . . .</P><P>Finally the day of departure was at hand. My Caucasian girl friendsgave me a farewell party and we told each other that I would be backsoon. The day before departure, we drove around our community to see allthe familiar landscape. . . . We were very depressed &#151; depressed tobe literally pushed out of this place, our home for over twenty-twoyears. ... I tried to assure myself and the others that we would be backvery soon. There was no reason why we should be kept in the camp when wewere trustworthy. Why, we would be back by Christmas, 1942.</P><P>Yes, this evacuation is the first discrimination that I ever felt.And I felt it hard. We were evacuated and the Italians and the Germanswere free. Many persons who were not anti-Japanese, that is, Caucasians,thought that evacuation was the best thing for us. Their argument wasthat we would be protected from mob violence. The way they spoke, itseemed as though they could not trust their fellow Americans. Isn'tAmerica civilized? . . .</P><P>The evacuee went on to describe her early experiences at Manzanar andtheir impact on her attitudes. She noted that her family rode on one ofthe 20 Pacific Electric and Greyhound buses that transported evacueesfrom Burbank to Manzanar on April 28. As they entered Manzanar, "a duststorm, the worst one that we ever encountered, met us." Their</P><P>hearts sank as we saw rows and rows of dismal tar-paperedpre-fabricated barracks and wondered whether we were asleep orexperiencing some horrible nightmare. The whole episode of evacuationstill seemed unreal. The people who came to greet us were very hardy tocome against the wind and the dust. They wore huge motorcyclist'sgoggles, bandannas, boots, and dusty clothes. We were examined by adoctor before we were allowed to get off the bus. We were officiallyinducted into this camp after we received our army blankets and wereassigned to our quarters. Upon reaching our home to be, we found that wehad to share our little room of 20' x 25' with another family. Countingall heads in both families, there were eight of us. The first night weslept on the floor. Tears slipped down my checks as I tried to sleep toovercome my disappointment. . . .</P><P>The evacuee related her struggles as she adjusted to hersurroundings:</P><P>The first month of readjustment was the hardest. Although I was amongmany persons, I was still very lonely. Very homesick and miserable. Onlythe mountains were of comfort to me because they reminded me of themountains back home. Because I am more of a small town girl, I suppose,the closeness of quarters seemed to make me wish for fresh air. Itseemed as though I were going to suffocate. . . .</P><P>I hated the sight of everything here. In the beginning of last year[1942], the rooms were not lined with plaster board and linoleum.Whenever the cold spring wind blew down from the snow covered SierraNevada mountains, the blast of cold wind would come into the roomsthrough the large holes and spaces between the floor boards and thewalls.</P><P>I know that I am not as bitter, lonely, nor as high strung as before.Until very recently, I tried to study to make the time go faster, but Icould not sit still for a long enough period of time without the desireto be on the go. I was too restless. I did not even try to make friendshere at first, but later I did. . . ."
