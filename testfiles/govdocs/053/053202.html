      <table width="671" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="395" height="2587" valign="top" bgcolor="#000000"> <p class="pgph">One 
              of the advantages of growing up on a hog farm is that education 
              comes quickly and lessons have a way of staying with you forever. 
              The following is absolutely true.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> One blustery spring day when I was about 12, my father 
              asked my brother and me to take the manure spreader out and unload 
              it on the fields. The manure spreader is a big wagon pulled behind 
              a tractor. As you drive, a powered conveyor system pushes the wagon&#8217;s 
              contents into steel beaters that spin rapidly, throwing wet, sloppy 
              pig waste high in a big brown fan shape in every direction behind 
              you.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> You can spray half a ton of the stuff in about two 
              minutes. When you&#8217;re a 12-year-old guy, this mechanical marvel 
              represents the pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> On this particular day, my brother drove the tractor 
              and I sat on the fender next to him. Our load had been fermenting 
              in a pile behind the barn for about two months. All went well on 
              the first pass across the field, although the 30-knot headwind made 
              us squint a bit. We reached the end of the field, cut power to the 
              spreader, kicked the left brake, spun the tractor around 180 degrees, 
              lined up for a return pass and turned the power back on.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> Did I mention the headwind? At this point it became 
              a tailwind. We were instantly engulfed in a slimy brown monsoon. 
              We panicked.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> My brother&#8217;s first instinct was to kick in 
              the clutch, which simply stopped us from moving forward and made 
              things worse. He quickly realized his mistake and made another by 
              letting it go with a lurch, sending us careening wildly across the 
              field because steering was now low on the priority list.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> Arms and legs thrashed everywhere as we both fought 
              each other for the controls, trying to shield our eyes and bumping 
              heads while fumbling for the now-slippery power take-off lever between 
              the pedals. Opening one&#8217;s mouth to speak was out of the question. 
              By the time we got things shut off, we were full, and the spreader 
              was empty.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> Mom made us strip down on the porch. Dad eventually 
              quit laughing and made us wash the tractor.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> That was the day I learned a valuable lesson about 
              personal risk management. My brother and I hadn&#8217;t properly 
              assessed the situation ahead of time or considered the possibility 
              of anything going wrong. Had we done so, we might have driven a 
              different path that didn&#8217;t put the wind behind us, worked 
              out emergency procedures to delegate tasks and prepare for rapid 
              shutdown, spent more time becoming proficient with the tractor&#8217;s 
              controls and worn rain gear.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> Instead, we smugly headed for disaster, confident 
              in our abilities and worry-free because nothing had ever gone wrong 
              before.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> So far in fiscal year 2004, Air Combat Command has 
              lost 16 of its members to mishaps. Most of those could have been 
              prevented if people had applied PRM principles and thought things 
              through before proceeding. People don&#8217;t wrap cars around trees 
              because they think they&#8217;re poor drivers; they do it because 
              they think they have everything under control and find out too late 
              that they don&#8217;t.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> My father didn&#8217;t call it PRM, but he summed 
              it up simply: What is the cost of being wrong? Take a look at the 
              whole picture when you&#8217;re doing something risky, and consider 
              the cost if something unforeseen happens or you&#8217;re not as 
              good as you think you are.</p>
            <p class="pgph"> If you&#8217;re not willing to pay that bill, look 
              for ways to do it smarter so the cost decreases. Take it from me: 
              Sometimes the benefit isn&#8217;t worth the risk.<br>
