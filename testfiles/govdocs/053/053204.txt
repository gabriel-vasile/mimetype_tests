        IF I HAD THE TOP  
                        -Dr.  Seuss 

    The Colliding Detector 
    was loaded for bear.  
    They had neutron detection 
    and silicon flair. 
    And a  great deal of wires  
    (or current emmiters)
    and a muonic system 
    (with a  bad case of jitters). 
    And of course the whole group 
    really got on quite nicely.  
    They all worked  together 
    for  TOP quite  precisely.  
    And tho their  detector  
    was  arguably  ugly:   
    "Got a  magnetic field!" 
    they would say oh so smugly.

   
    But the D-zero people 
    were ready, quite plain.
    With their huge box of iron.
    And unity gain.
    Got a transition thing 
    and their own wires too.
    But no magnetic field.   
    Not the best they can do.
    So they bought one!  
    "Next time we'll have B and then P
    and then we'll be the best 
    on this whole big prairie."

    And from far far away,  
    watching all of the thrills
    Lived the big DOE 
    who paid all of the bills.
    And they loved both detectors  
    with hardly a doubt.
    But they had to find something 
    or else they'd be out!
    Cause they answered to Congress.  
    The meanest of mean!
    Killed the Collider. 
    Killed it quick.
    Killed it clean.
    So they said to their lab 
    from the place where they stood
    "Here's  the  money.  
    Find  TOP  quarks. 
    And  please,  make  it  good!"

    So the CDF group 
    in their own quiet way
    found a one  in  a  million.  
    Or  more! Who can say?
    And  who  cares?  
    But does D-zero see it there too?
    No they don't. 
    Well not really.  
    But then maybe they do!
    It's  such  fun  to  know  facts, 
    which  were  thought  to  be  easy
    were really  quite  slippery.
    And  also quite sneezy!

    And so there you have it.   
    The TOP's in the bag.
    And so  on  and  so forth 
    can rightfully  brag.
    But the TOP quark's still out there.  
    Could  really  be  true!
    And who'll really find it?
    Maybe me.   
    Maybe YOU!
