<p class=PdfParaStyle15>MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle16>TRUSTEE'S COMPLAINT FOR REVOCATION OF DISCHARGE 
 AND</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle17>ENTERING MONETARY JUDGMENT AGAINST DEBTOR </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle18>The matter before the Court is the Chapter 7 Trustee's 
 Complaint for Turnover and</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>Revocation of Discharge 
 pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 727(d)(3).<span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">1</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> The plaintiff, Chapter 7 Trustee J.</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>Michael Morris (hereafter 
 &quot;Trustee&quot;), appears in person and by J. Michael Morris of Klenda,</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>Mitchell Austerman &amp; 
 Zuercher, LLC. The defendant, Debtor Lillian Morris (hereafter</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>&quot;Debtor&quot;), 
 appears by Sean C. McEnulty of the McEnulty Law Firm, P.A. There are no 
 other</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6><span class=PdfCharStyle6>appearances. 
 The Court has jurisdiction,</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">2</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> and the parties have so stipulated.</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20><span class=PdfCharStyle6>In the Pretrial Order, 
 Trustee contends that Debtor's discharge should be revoked</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>pursuant to §§ 727(d)(2) 
 and (d)(3) for failure to turnover to the Trustee the estate's interest 
 in</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>2005 tax refunds. The 
 Trustee also prays for a judgment against Debtor for the estate's share 
 of</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>the refunds and related 
 amounts. Trial was held on September 11, 2007. As reflected in the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>following Findings of 
 Fact, the Court found Debtor's testimony credible. The Court took the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>matter under advisement. 
 Having considered the exhibits, the testimony, and the arguments of</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>counsel, the Court is 
 now ready to rule. For the following reasons, the Court denies the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>complaint for revocation 
 of discharge and enters judgment against Debtor for $5,990.82, plus</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>interest.</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle21><span class=PdfCharStyle6><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">1</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle5> 
 This case was filed before October 17, 2005, when most provisions of the 
 Bankruptcy Abuse&nbsp;Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 become 
 effective. All statutory references to the&nbsp;Bankruptcy Code are to 
 11 U.S.C. §§ 101 - 1330 (2004), unless otherwise specified. All references 
 to the&nbsp;Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure are to Fed. R. Bankr. 
 P. (2004), unless otherwise specified.</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle22><span class=PdfCharStyle6><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">2</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle5> 
 This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant 
 to 28 U.S.C. §§</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle23><span class=PdfCharStyle6>157(a) and 1334(a) and 
 (b), and the Standing Order of the United States District Court for the 
 District of&nbsp;Kansas that exercised authority conferred by § 157(a) 
 to refer to the District's bankruptcy judges all&nbsp;matters under the 
 Bankruptcy Code and all proceedings arising under the Code or arising 
 in or related to a&nbsp;case under the Code, effective July 10, 1984. 
 Furthermore, this Court may hear and finally adjudicate this&nbsp;matter 
 because it is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 157(b)(2)(J). 
 There is no objection to&nbsp;venue or jurisdiction over the parties. 
 </span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle24><span class=PdfCharStyle6><span class=PdfCharStyle6>2</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle25>I. FINDINGS OF FACT.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Trustee's evidence consisted of Debtor's testimony 
 and written documents, including a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>transcript of Debtor's § 341 meeting and copies 
 of her tax returns. Debtor's evidence was also</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>presented through her testimony. Debtor was the 
 only witness who testified at trial.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Debtor filed for relief under Chapter 7 on October 
 14, 2005. She used the services of a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>bankruptcy preparer but did not consult an attorney. 
 Her schedules list no real property;</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>personal property of $73,855, which includes a 
 mobile home valued at $50,000, a vehicle valued</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>at $4,320, and a $15,000 child support claim; secured 
 claims of $57,773; unsecured claims of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>$25,824.50; monthly net income of $1,161.63; and 
 monthly expenses of $1,524. Debtor</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>appeared pro se at the 341 meeting of creditors 
 on November 9, 2005. At the hearing the Debtor</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>presented and the Trustee reviewed Debtor's 2004 
 tax returns. The 2004 federal return shows a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refund of $1152 because of overpayment through 
 withholding taxes. The only exemption</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>claimed was for Debtor.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>At the 341 meeting, the Trustee advised Debtor 
 that he would need copies of her 2005 tax</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>returns to be filed after the beginning of the 
 year. He stated, &quot;If you have a refund coming, do</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>not cash or spend that until you find out whether 
 we'll make a claim.&quot; The Trustee also delivered</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to Debtor at the § 341 hearing a document entitled 
 &quot;Notice Concerning your 2005 Tax Returns</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>and Refunds.&quot; It stated in part:</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle26><span class=PdfCharStyle6>REMEMBER: A portion of 
 your </span><span class=PdfCharStyle1>2005 federal and state tax&nbsp;refunds</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> is property of your bankruptcy estate.</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle27><span class=PdfCharStyle6>When you file your </span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle1>2005 federal and state tax returns</span><span class=PdfCharStyle6>, 
 you must&nbsp;provide full copies of those returns to your attorney (or 
 to the&nbsp;trustee if you are not represented by an attorney) at the 
 same time&nbsp;you file them. In the event you are entitled to a refund, 
 you </span><span class=PdfCharStyle1>must&nbsp;not cash your refund checks</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6>. Rather, you should contact your&nbsp;attorney (or 
 the trustee if you are not represented by an attorney)</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle28>3</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle27>and await further instruction. If your refunds 
 are direct deposited&nbsp;to a bank account, you must segregate the refunds 
 until you receive&nbsp;further instructions.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Debtor acknowledges receipt of the written notice. 
 She timely provided the Trustee with copies</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>of her 2005 federal and state returns. Debtor received 
 her discharge on January 31, 2006.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Debtor's 2005 tax returns, prepared with the assistance 
 of a preparer, were filed in</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>February, 2006. Debtor's 2005 federal return claimed, 
 in addition to Debtor, four dependents,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Debtor's son, Debtor's son's girlfriend, and two 
 grandchildren. Debtor's total income was</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>$17,252. After the application of the standard 
 deduction and the personal deductions, no taxes</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>were owed, although $1,854 had been withheld. The 
 return also showed that Debtor was entitled</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to an earned income credit of $3,788 (based upon 
 the two grandchildren) and additional child tax</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>credit of $713. The total of these three amounts 
 ($6,355) was designated on line 43 of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>federal tax return as payment by the Debtor, even 
 though two of the three categories were not</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>in fact payments. Line 44 of the return showed 
 the amount you overpaid was $6,355,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>although again, two of the three categories of 
 money that made up that amount were not money</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>paid by the Debtor. Line 45 of the return read 
 $6,355 is the amount of line 44 you want</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refunded to you, even though $4,501 of the amount 
 was not really a refund. Rather, it was a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>payment from the government intended to provide 
 a certain amount of money to poor households</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>with children. </span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">3</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The return specified payment by deposit to Debtor's 
 checking account. The federal</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refund was credited to her checking account in 
 late March 2006, and Debtor used the funds for</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle29><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">3</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle8> See</span><span class=PdfCharStyle5> Jennifer E. 
 Spreng, When &quot;Welfare&quot; Becomes &quot;Work Support&quot;: Exempting 
 Earned Income&nbsp;Tax Credit Payments in Consumer Bankruptcy, 78 Am. 
 Bankr. L. J. 279 (2004).</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle24>4</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>living expenses. The Kansas return showed no taxes 
 due and a refund of $1,264, comprised of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>$480 in withheld taxes, $568 earned income credit, 
 and $216 food sales tax refund. The refund</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>was received about two weeks after the return was 
 filed. Debtor used the state refund for living</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>expenses.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Debtor provided a copy of the federal return to 
 the Trustee. On March 3, 2006, the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee moved to reopen the case and gave notice 
 of assets. The Trustee, by letter to the Debtor</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>dated March 3, 2006, acknowledged receipt of the 
 2005 federal return and stated that the estate</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>was entitled to 287/365th of the federal payment 
 in the amount of $4,996.94. He requested</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>remittance &quot;as soon as the refund has been 
 received by the debtor.&quot; The Trustee also stated he</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>did not receive a copy of the 2005 state return 
 and requested a copy. Debtor provided a copy of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>her state return. The Trustee by letter dated March 
 8, 2006, requested remittance from the state</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refund of &quot;$993.88 as soon as the remittance 
 has been received by the debtor.&quot; </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Debtor was shocked by the amounts requested by 
 the Trustee. She had understood the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee would get a part of her refund, meaning 
 her overpayment by wage deductions. When</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>she filed her tax returns, Debtor thought that 
 the Trustee would have no claim to the earned</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>income credit and the child tax credits, both of 
 which in her view &quot;belonged&quot; to her</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>grandchildren. Debtor would not have sought the 
 refunds if she had known they would have to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>be turned over to the Trustee. Debtor did not understand 
 her obligation to the Trustee.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>On May 19, 2006, Trustee filed a motion for turnover 
 of $5,990.82, the estate's share of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the 2005 tax refunds. The motion did not allege 
 that Debtor had present possession or control of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the refunds or seek a judgment for the value of 
 the refunds. The motion was noticed, with</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>objection deadline. Debtor does not question receipt 
 of the notice and a copy of the motion. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle31>5</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>Debtor did not respond to the motion, and a default 
 order of turnover of $5,990.82 within 10</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>days was entered on June 9, 2006 (hereafter Turnover 
 Order).</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Trustee advised Debtor of the Turnover Order 
 by letter dated November 2, 2006.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Debtor was confused by the order and did not intend 
 not to follow it. In the letter, the Trustee</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>stated that if payment was not received by November 
 12, 2006, he would proceed to file an</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>adversary for turnover and revocation of discharge 
 and would request interest, costs, and &quot;a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>minimum of $500.00 in attorney fees.&quot; Debtor 
 responded by sending to the Trustee a copy of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee's letter on which she had typed the following:</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle26>Please proceed with a revocation of discharge, 
 as I don't have any money&nbsp;to feed myself and my dependants. I can't 
 pay you any minimum of&nbsp;attorney fees, as I barely can pay my electric 
 and water bill. I am sorry&nbsp;that I can't pay you money. Please do 
 not beat me down any further that I&nbsp;already am. Your words are freightening 
 and upsetting. Don,t spend any&nbsp;more time and just go ahead with your 
 revoke. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>&nbsp;Debtor attempted to call the Trustee three 
 or four times because she was confused. The</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee was not available. One time she talked 
 with someone in his office about the amounts</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>claimed, but did not understand what she was told.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Trustee filed the adversary Complaint on January 
 31, 2007. Counsel for Debtor entered</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>his appearance and filed an answer on February 
 28, 2007. It was not until she retained counsel</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>that Debtor understood that the estate has in interest 
 in all moneys paid as a refund, including</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>those attributable due to the earned income credit 
 and child tax credit. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle32>6</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle25>II. Analysis and Conclusions of Law.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle33><span class=PdfCharStyle1>A. Revocation of Discharge</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6>.</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide 
 the honest, but unfortunate, debtor a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>fresh start.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">4</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Congress described § 727's discharge provisions as 
 'the heart of the fresh start</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>provisions of the bankruptcy 
 law.'</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">5</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> The availability of revocation of discharge allows 
 a debtor</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to receive a discharge early in the case while 
 protecting the estate and creditors if one of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>enumerate grounds for 
 revocation arises.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">6</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> The bankruptcy court must strictly construe the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>provisions on revocation of discharge and revoke 
 a discharge only for reasons clearly stated in</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>the Code.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">7</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> The trustee has the burden of proof to establish 
 his revocation of discharge claim by a</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>preponderance of the

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>In this case, the order of discharge was filed 
 on January 31, 2006, and the case was closed on the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>same date. The case was reopened by order filed 
 on March 27, 2006. The Complaint to revoke</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>discharge was filed on January 31, 2007. Debtor 
 contends that the Complaint was filed one day</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>late, urging that one year after the granting of 
 such discharge ended on January 30, 2007. For</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the following reasons, the Court finds that the 
 Complaint was timely. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>&nbsp;First, the Trustee suggests that the complaint 
 was timely filed under § 727(e)(2)(B)</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>because it was filed after the case was reopened. 
 This Court rejects that argument. Courts</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>holding a claim to be timely if filed while a case 
 is reopened do so on the basis that a case is not</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>really closed if there are concealed assets or 
 the conduct of the debtor tolls the running of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>time to seek revocation.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">9</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Many courts, however, reject this view and construe 
 § 727(e) as a</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>statute of repose, not 
 a statute of limitations.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">10</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> A statute of repose establishes a time limit during</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>which a defendant's wrongful act must be the basis 
 for a suit or be forever barred. The limit may</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>not be tolled based upon the defendant's conduct 
 or otherwise. This Court finds this to be the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>better view. The subsection establishes a firm 
 cut off date after which a discharge is final. To</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle38><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">9</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle8> E.g</span><span class=PdfCharStyle5>.,</span><span

 125 B.R. 168 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1991).</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle22><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">10</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle8> E.g., Hadlock v. Dolliver (In re Dolliver)</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle5>, 255 B.R. 251 (Bankr. D. Me. 2000). </span><span

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>allow the reopening of a case to extend the time 
 would indefinitely and unpredictably extend the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>period to challenge a 
 discharge and there would be no repose of the possibility of revocation.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">11</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Next, the Trustee urges that the Complaint was 
 timely under § 727(e)(2)(A) because the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>one year time period commenced on the day after 
 the filing of the order of discharge. The Court</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>agrees with this position. Neither the parties' 
 nor the Court's own research have located any</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>directly applicable authorities addressing whether 
 for purposes of § 727(e)(2)(A) the one year</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>time limit starts on the date of the entry of the 
 order of discharge (January 31, 2006), or the date</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>following the entry of 
 the order.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">12</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20><span class=PdfCharStyle6>The Trustee cites Rule 
 9006</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">13</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> regarding computation of time for purposes of the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>bankruptcy rules and the Federal Rules of Civil 
 Procedure. Whether and to what extent . . .</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>[Code] time periods are to be measured by the mechanics 
 of Rule 9006(a) has developed into a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>matter of some controversy.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">14</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Rather than weighing in on this difficult question, 
 the Court</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>construes the statutory language. Under § 727(e)(2)(A), 
 the complaint must be filed before . . .</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle21><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">11</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle8> See Int'l State Bank v. Fresques (In re Fresquez)</span><span

 BAP affirmed a revocation of discharge&nbsp;under § 727(d)(2) where the 
 complaint was filed one year after the grant of discharge. Although the&nbsp;timeliness 
 of the action was not addressed in the BAP opinion, the court affirmed 
 the bankruptcy court,&nbsp;which had found the action timely. </span><span

 of discharge. Before is defined as earlier in time.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">15</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle6> 
 After is</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>defined as later in time; 
 afterward.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">16</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> According to the statute, the cut off starts after 
 the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>granting of the discharge, which means the day 
 following the granting of discharge. The period</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>of one year therefore runs for one year after that 
 date, or through the anniversary date of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>filing. In this case the Complaint was filed on 
 the one year anniversary date.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Further, the Court agrees with the Trustee's argument 
 that the periods under §§ 727(e)(1)</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>and (e)(2) should be similarly construed. As a 
 matter or policy, this makes sense and is</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>supported by the legislative 
 history cited by the Trustee.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">17</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Under § 727(e)(1), the complaint</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>must be filed within one year after such discharge. 
 By use of the word after, the statute clearly</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>states that the one year period does not commence 
 until the day after the filing of the order. To</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>hold that the time to file under § 727(d)(1), governed 
 by § 727(e)(1), expired on January 31 but</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the time to file under §§ 727(d)(2) or (d)(3), 
 governed by § 727(e)(2), expired on January 30,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>2006 would be a strained construction. It would 
 be inconsistent with Rule 9006 and the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>generally applicable construction of time limits. 
 It would set a trap for those wishing to object to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>discharge and create a needless disparity between 
 the time limits for claims governed by §§</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>727(e)(1) and (e)(2). </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Court therefore holds that the time limit for 
 filing a complaint to revoke discharge</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>under §§ 727(d)(2) or (d)(3), which is governed 
 by § 727(e)(2)(A), commences on the day after</p>

 of Discharge Pursuant to § 727(d)(2) is Denied.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Section 727(d)(2) provides as follows regarding 
 revocation of discharge:</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle26>(d) On request of the trustee, a creditor, or the 
 United States&nbsp;trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the court 
 shall revoke a&nbsp;discharge granted under subsection (a) of this section 
 if--</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle43>***</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle26>(2) the debtor acquired property that is property 
 of the estate, or&nbsp;became entitled to acquire property that would 
 be property of the&nbsp;estate, and knowingly and fraudulently failed 
 to report the&nbsp;acquisition of or entitlement to such property, or 
 to deliver or&nbsp;surrender such property to the trustee;</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Trustee contends that Debtor's discharge should 
 be revoked because after receiving</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>her discharge, she received 
 tax refunds in which the estate has an interest</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">18</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle6> 
 and has failed to</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>deliver or surrender the funds in response to the 
 request of the Trustee and the Turnover Order</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>entered by the Court. Debtor contends her discharge 
 should not be revoked because her failure</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to deliver the estate's share of the refunds was 
 not knowing and fraudulent.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>In order to revoke a discharge under this section, 
 the Trustee must establish the Debtor</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>acquired property of the estate and knowingly and 
 fraudulently failed to report or deliver the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>property to the Trustee. In this case, Debtor acknowledges 
 that the estate has an interest in the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>tax refunds. It is uncontroverted that the Debtor 
 reported the tax refunds to the Trustee. The</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>controversy focuses upon whether she acted knowingly 
 and fraudulently when failing to deliver</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle44><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">18</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle5> It is settled in the Tenth Circuit that the estate 
 has an interest in tax refunds attributable to</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle23><span class=PdfCharStyle5>earned income tax credits, 
 pro-rated to the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. The tax code 
 provides&nbsp;that the credits are to be treated as tax refunds, and interests 
 which were contingent of the date of filing&nbsp;are included in the estate.

 class=PdfCharStyle5>).</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>11</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>the refunds to the Trustee. &quot;The term 'knowingly 
 and fraudulently' requires that the debtor be</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>guilty of such acts as would sustain a civil action 
 for fraud or deceit. The debtor's actions must</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>have been taken with the knowing intent to defraud 
 the trustee, or be so reckless as to justify a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>finding that he acted 
 fraudulently.&quot;</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">19</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Court is not convinced of Debtor's fraudulent 
 intent. Debtor was shocked at the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>amount requested by the Trustee. She very promptly 
 provided the Trustee with all of the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>information he requested regarding the refunds. 
 Debtor credibly testified that in her view the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>earned income tax credit and the child tax refund 
 &quot;belonged&quot; to her grandchildren. It is clear to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Court that she did not view these moneys as 
 refunds. All of the written communications to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>her talked about refunds. These communications 
 did not define refunds to include the earned</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>income tax credits, the child tax credit, or the 
 food sales tax refund. Although Debtor's</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>understanding about the refunds was misguided, 
 it was not fraudulent.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Debtor attempted to contact the Trustee three or 
 four times. Her efforts to talk to the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee for clarification were unsuccessful, although 
 she did not give her name or leave a phone</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>number on at least some occasions. Although, in 
 reality, Debtor's expectation to talk to the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Trustee was unrealistic, given his case load, there 
 is no evidence that Debtor was aware she was</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>being unrealistic when responding to the Trustee's 
 request for turnover. Further, while Debtor</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>understood she was to pay the Trustee a portion 
 of the actual tax she had paid and was later</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refunded to her, her failure to so does not rise 
 to the level of a fraudulent behavior because most</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>people would not pay anything to the Trustee until 
 there was agreement as to the correct amount.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>12</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle18>&nbsp;Notice by the Trustee to the Debtor of the 
 estate's interest in the refunds, coupled with</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Debtor's failure to turnover the refunds, is not 
 sufficient to establish fraud. This case is similar to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle46><span class=PdfCharStyle9>In re Wright</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6>,</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">20</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> recently decided by Chief Judge Nugent, where debtor's 
 turn over of half rather</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>than all of his 2004 tax refund was based upon 
 his belief that an agreement with his ex-wife that</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>they would equally share the refund, controlled 
 what the trustee was entitled to receive. As in</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>this case, the Debtor had been informed of his 
 obligation to turnover the refund by the trustee at</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the meeting of creditors and was advised of his 
 obligation by letter. Despite the turnover order,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>debtor did not pay the full amount to the trustee. 
 The court declined to revoke discharge under §</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>727(d)(2). The court found that while debtor's 
 believe that his agreement with his ex-wife</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>controlled the trustee's right to the refund was 
 misguided and ill-advised, the court was not</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>convinced that debtor 
 had acted with fraudulent intent.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">21</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20><span class=PdfCharStyle6>Absence of fraudulent 
 intent was also found in </span><span class=PdfCharStyle9>In re Everetts</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6>,</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">22</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> where debtor distributed a</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>$20,000 inheritance received postpetition. The 
 court stated:</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle47>The trustee also asks the Court to revoke the debtor's 
 discharge&nbsp;pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 727(d)(2). Although the debtor 
 admits that&nbsp;she distributed estate property after the commencement 
 of the case,&nbsp;we find that her conduct was not sufficiently or knowingly&nbsp;fraudulent 
 to warrant that action. She reported the bequest on her&nbsp;amended schedules 
 as required, and we find her actions to have&nbsp;been induced as the 
 result of an elderly, ailing mother's reliance on&nbsp;bad advice from 
 trusted sources who did know what they were&nbsp;doing, and who acted 
 willfully and knowingly in obtaining&nbsp;property from the debtor which 
 was not hers to give. Accordingly,</p>

 of Discharge Pursuant to § 727(d)(3) is Denied.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Subsection 727(d)(3) provides as follows regarding 
 revocation of discharge: </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle26>(d) On request of the trustee, a creditor, or the 
 United States&nbsp;trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the court 
 shall revoke a&nbsp;discharge granted under subsection (a) of this section 
 if&#8211;</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle49>&nbsp;***</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle27>(3) the debtor committed an act specified in subsection 
 (a)(6) of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle27>this section; </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle48>Subsection 727(a)(6) provides for denial of discharge 
 if the debtor has refused, in the case - (A)</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to obey any lawful order of the court, other than 
 an order to respond to a material question or to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>testify. The Trustee contends that Debtor's discharge 
 should be revoked because she failed to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>turnover her federal and state refunds as ordered 
 by the Court in the Turnover Order, filed on</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>June 9, 2006.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>In order to grant the Trustee's Complaint for revocation 
 of discharge under § 727(d)(3)</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Court must find that the June 9, 2006 order 
 was a lawful order. The authority on what is a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>lawful order is very sparse. One commentator states, 
 without citation to cases or legislative</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle35><span class=PdfCharStyle11><span style="vertical-align: Super;">23</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle8> Id</span><span class=PdfCharStyle5>., 71 B.R. at

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>14</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>history, that [a]n order is lawful if it is authorized 
 in the words of, or by implication from, the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>statute.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">24</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Court has serious concern about the lawfulness 
 of the June 9, 2006 order as a basis to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>revoke discharge. That order was issued in response 
 to the Trustee's motion under § 542(a),</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>which provides in relevant part that an entity 
 . . . in possession, custody, or control during the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>case, of property [of the estate] shall deliver 
 to the trustee, and account for, such property or the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>value of such property. The section establishes 
 alternative remedies, turnover of the property or</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>accounting for its value. For an order for turnover 
 to be appropriate, it is necessary that a</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>trustee demonstrate, not only that the debtor received 
 or had possession of estate property, but</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>also that the debtor was in possession of the property, 
 or its value, at the time the turnover</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>motion was filed.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">25</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> This requirement dates from at least the 1948 decision 
 of the Supreme</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle50><span class=PdfCharStyle6>Court in </span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle9>Maggio v. Zeitz</span><span class=PdfCharStyle6>,</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">26</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> where the court vacated orders of commitment for 
 contempt for</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>failure to comply with turnover orders. At that 
 time there was no statutory basis for turnover,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>but the bankruptcy courts had fashioned a summary 
 turnover procedure to retrieve concealed</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>and diverted assets or 
 secreted books of account.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">27</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> The Court held that [t]he nature and</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>derivation of the remedy make clear that is appropriate 
 only when the evidence satisfactorily</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>establishes the existence of the property or its 
 proceeds, and possession thereof by the defendant</p>

 the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>limited reach of the turnover proceeding may be 
 a crime, or, if it violates an order of the referee,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>a criminal contempt, but no such acts, however 
 reprehensible, warrant issuance of an order</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>which creates a duty 
 impossible of performance, so that punishment can follow.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">29</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Although a</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>bankruptcy court's authority and procedure for 
 turnover has now been codified in § 542, the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>requirement that the turnover defendant have the 
 property sought or its proceeds at the time of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>the complaint continues 
 to be valid.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">30</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> If the defendant cannot turnover the property or 
 the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>proceeds of the property because they are no longer 
 in his possession, custody or control, § 542</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>gives the alternative remedy of a judgment for 
 the value of the property.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>In this case, the Trustee's motion for turnover 
 did not allege that Debtor had possession,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>custody, or control of the tax refunds when the 
 motion was filed and did not seek the alternative</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>remedy of a judgment for the value of the property. 
 The evidence establishes that on June 9,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>2006 she was not in possession of the refunds, 
 which had been spent. In similar circumstances,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Colorado Bankruptcy Court discounted the effect 
 of its earlier Turnover Order in reaching</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>its decision in a revocation

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>16</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>upon the debtor's noncompliance with an order of 
 turnover where the debtor was not in</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>possession of the property 
 at the time the motion for turnover was filed.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">32</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>This Court likewise discounts the turnover order 
 as a basis for revocation of discharge. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Since Debtor was not in possession of the tax refunds 
 when the motion for turnover was filed,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>she had a valid defense to the motion. Once entered, 
 the order, although flawed, become</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>enforceable, and the Court knows of no theory under 
 which it can be collaterally attacked in this</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>proceeding.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">33</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Nevertheless, the Court finds that to revoke discharge 
 based upon non compliance</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>with an order which the Debtor could not obey when 
 it was entered and could not have complied</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>with at any time since its entry, makes no sense. 
 In compliance with the policy that the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>conditions for revocation of discharge be strictly 
 construed to preserve the debtor's discharge,</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Court construes the adjective lawful to include 
 the requirement that the Debtor could have</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>performed in accordance with the order when it 
 was entered. Otherwise, trustees would have the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>ability to obtain turnover orders which create 
 duties impossible of performance so that denial or</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>revocation of discharge can follow. For this reason, 
 the Court declines to revoke the Debtor's</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>discharge under § 727(d)(3).</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>Further, the Court construes the word refused to 
 include the requirement that the failure</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>to obey the lawful order was willful and intentional 
 and finds Debtor's failure to obey the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>turnover order was not willful and intentional 
 for purposes of § 727(a)(6). Since the enactment</p>

 class=PdfCharStyle5> For example, in contempt proceedings obedience to 
 decree is required, even though the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle23><span class=PdfCharStyle5>issuing court has based 
 its decision on an incorrect view of the law, unless there was no opportunity 
 for&nbsp;effective review of the decree. 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur

 </span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>17</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle30>of this section, courts have diverged on whether 
 the statutory term 'refused' requires an element</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>of willfulness or intent.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">34</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Some find that the use of the word refused denotes 
 that an action</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>under the section should 
 be treated as a civil contemp.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">35</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle6> 
 The elements to find civil contempt are:</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Knowledge of the order; violation of the order; 
 and that the order violated was specific and</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>definite.</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">36</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> Impossibility or inability to comply is a defense 
 only if after using due diligence, the</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>person, through no fault 
 of his own, is still unable to comply with the order.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">37</span></span><span class=PdfCharStyle6> 
 This standard</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>effectively negates an 
 intent requirement. Other courts, which are in the majority,</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">38</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> find that</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>mere failure to comply does not equate to refusal 
 where there is no showing of willful or</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>intentional disobedience, 
 as opposed to inability, inadvertence, or mistake.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span 
 style="vertical-align: Super;">39</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The issue has not been authoritatively decided 
 in this district. In an opinion not</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>designated for publication, the Tenth Circuit Court 
 of Appeals adopted that second view, holding</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>that a court may deny a debtor a discharge of a 
 debt if he or she willfully or intentionally refuses</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle50><span class=PdfCharStyle6>to testify after improperly

 and held that a</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>plaintiff attempting to prohibit or revoke a debtor's 
 discharge under § 727(a)(6)(A) must show</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the court by a preponderance of the evidence that 
 the debtor willfully or intentionally failed to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>comply with the court's 
 lawful order.</span><span class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">43</span></span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>This Court agrees with the majority position that 
 refusal implies an element of</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>willfulness and intentional failure to comply. 
 Denial or revocation of discharge is an extreme</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>penalty contrary to the general Code provision 
 that the discharge provisions be liberally</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>construed in favor of the debtor's fresh start. 
 Of course, this benefit to the debtor must be</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>balanced against the important policy of preserving 
 the integrity of court orders. The Court finds</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>that adopting a construction of refused that considers 
 the debtor's intent and requires an</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>element of willfulness and intentional noncompliance 
 before denying or revoking a discharge for</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>failure to comply with a court order strikes the 
 proper balance.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>The Court is not convinced that Debtor willfully 
 and intentionally failed to comply with</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Turnover Order. Debtor's failure to comply 
 with the Trustee's directives cannot be a basis</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>for revocation under § 727(d)(3), which requires 
 refusal to obey a lawful order of the court. The</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Turnover Order was not issued until June 9, after 
 Debtor had received and spent the refunds for</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>living expenses. Debtor was confused by the order, 
 since she believed that the refund based</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>upon the earned income credit and child credit 
 were for her grandchildren. Debtor's failure to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>comply with the order was based upon inability 
 to pay money she did not have and mistaken</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>understanding.</p>

 class=PdfCharStyle8> Id.</span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle41>19</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle18>This is a close case. Although not condoning Debtor's 
 actions, the Court finds that</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Debtor did not refuse to obey a lawful order of 
 the court within the meaning of § 727(d)(3).</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>Revocation of discharge is not appropriate given 
 the principal that the exceptions to the general</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>policy favoring discharge be narrowly construed.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle33>E. Trustee's Request for Judgment for $5,990.82 
 and Related Charges.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>In the Complaint, the Trustee prays for entry of 
 judgment for the amount of the 2005</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>refunds attributable to the portion of the year 
 period prior to Debtor's filing for relief. The</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>turnover order identified this amount as $5,990.82, 
 and Debtor has provided no basis on which to</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>revise this figure. The Complaint also requests 
 that the judgment include prejudgment interest at</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>10% from the date Debtor received the refunds, 
 attorney fees of $500, and sanction of $200. </p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>While the Trustee has provided the Court with no 
 authority supporting entry of judgment</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>in his Complaint or otherwise, the prayer contained 
 in the Complaint sought a judgment and the</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19><span class=PdfCharStyle6>pretrial order</span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle10><span style="vertical-align: Super;">44</span></span><span 
 class=PdfCharStyle6> contemplated a money judgment. Section 542(a) provides 
 a basis for a judgment. </span></p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>In as much as the Court has ruled that the Turnover 
 Order previously entered against Debtor is</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>suspect at best, it does not constitute a res judicata 
 defense to the entry of a judgment as an</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>alternative remedy under § 542 under the circumstances 
 of this case. Therefore, the Court holds</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>the Trustee is entitled to a judgment in the amount 
 of $5,990.82, plus interest at the statutory rate</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle19>from the date judgment is entered. The judgment 
 is, of course, not discharged by the discharge</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle50><span class=PdfCharStyle6>order entered of January 
 31, 2006. Further, the Court, pursuant to the rationale of</span><span

<p class=PdfParaStyle55>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p class=PdfParaStyle20>For the forgoing reasons the Court denies the Chapter 
 7 Trustee's Complaint for</p>
