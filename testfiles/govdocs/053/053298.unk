Elevated CA^6829^Plantago lanceolata L. seedlings were grown in sand microcosm units over a 43-day experimental period under two CO2 regimes (800 or 400 mu mol mol(-1)) to investigate the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on carbon partitioning and exudate release. Total organic carbon (TOC) content of the collected exudate material was measured throughout the experimental period. After 42 days growth the seedlings were labelled with [C-14]-CO2 and the fate of the label within the plant and its release by the roots monitored. Elevated CO2 significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) enhanced shoot, root and total dry matter production although the R:S ratio was unaltered, suggesting no alteration in press carbon partitioning. The cumulative release of TOC (in mg C) over 0-42 days was unaltered by CO2 treatment however, when expressed as a percentage of net assimilated C, ambient-grown plants released a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) higher percentage from their roots compared to elevated CO2-grown plants (i.e. 8 vs 3%). The distribution of C-14-label was markedly altered by CO2 treatment with significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) greater per cent label partitioned to the roots under elevated CO2. This indicates increased partitioning of recent assimilate belowground under elevated CO2 treatment although there was no significant difference in the percentage of C-14-label released by the roots. Comparison of plant C budgets based on C-14-pulse-chase methodology and TOC measurements is discussed.2033^2^Jongen,M^Jones,MB^1998^1^Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on plant biomass production and competition in a simulated neutral grassland community^52^82^1^111-123^^^^^Jul^^^^^68321065^1684^1960^3107^344^349^436^506^507^92^release of TOC (in mg C) over 0-42 days was unaltered by CO2 treatment however, when expressed as a percentage of net assimilated C, ambient-grown plants released a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) higher percentage from their roots compared to elevatedA^6831^Using open-top chambers, four prominent species (Lolium perenne, Cynosurus cristatus, Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris) of Irish neutral grasslands were grown at ambient and elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2 for a period of 8 months. The effects of interspecific competition on plant responses to CO2 enrichment were investigated by growing the species in a four-species mixture. The results indicate that the species differ in their ability to respond to elevated CO2. CO2-enrichment had the largest effect on the biomass production of H. lanatus, but substantial stimulations in biomass production were also found for the other three species. The CO2-stimulation of biomass production for H. lanatus was accompanied by increased tillering. In addition, reductions in specific leaf area were found for all species. Exposure to elevated CO2 increased the community biomass of the four- species mixture. This increase can be mainly attributed to a significant increase in the biomass of H. lanatus at elevated CO2. No statistically-significant changes in species composition of community biomass were found. However, H. lanatus did increase its share of community biomass at each of the harvests, with the other three species, mainly L. perenne, suffering losses in their shares at elevated CO2. The results show that: (1) the species varied in their response to elevated CO2; and (2) species composition in natural plant communities is likely to change at elevated CO2, but these changes may occur rather slowly. Much longer periods of exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 may be required to permit detection of significant changes in species composition.

We hypothesized that: (1) maximum rates and annual estimates of soil J(CO2) would be greater in more productive burned sites than in unburned sites, (2) soil J(CO2) would be greater in newly burned sites with a history of fire exclusion than in annually burned sites (consistent with differences in aboveground production), and (3) soil temperature and water availability would be primary abiotic determinants of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie. A preliminary assessment of the effects of large herbivores on soil J(CO2) was included to evaluate the hypothesis that removal of aboveground biomass would reduce soil J(CO2). Results indicated that spring fire increased maximum monthly soil J(CO2) by 20-55% relative to unburned tallgrass prairie, with greatest monthly differences measured in April (fourfold higher in burned sites). In burned sites that differed in fire history, maximum monthly J(CO2) in annually burned prairie was 33% greater than in burned sites with a history of fire exclusion. Soil J(CO2) in these latter sites was still significantly higher than in unburned sites. Soil J(CO2) in sites grazed by bison was reduced by as much as 30% relative to adjacent ungrazed areas. Reduced root biomass and activity in grazed areas, unburned sites, and sites with a history of fire exclusion suggest that plants play a major role in determining soil J(CO2) in this grassland. Soil temperature at 5 cm was related strongly to midday J(CO2) in both annually burned sites (r(2) = 0.58) and unburned sites (r(2) = 0.71). In contrast, differences in soil moisture among sites, enhanced by comparing irrigated grassland to control areas, increased maximum monthly J(CO2) by only 8%. Thus, soil temperature was the primary abiotic determinant of soil J(CO2) during this study. Maximum monthly estimates of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie ranged from 10.3 mu mol CO2 . m(-2) . s(-1) in unburned sites to 15.1 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) in annually burned irrigated sites, whereas annual estimates varied from 4.7 to 7.8 kg CO2/m(2). Over the 2-yr period, spring fire increased estimated annual soil J(CO2) by 38-51% relative to unburned sites, while irrigation increased annual soil J(CO2) by 13%. These estimates for tallgrass prairie are much higher than those reported for most temperate ecosystems but are similar to estimates for tropical forests. Characteristics of undisturbed tallgrass prairie that may lead to high levels of soil J(CO2) include: high above- and belowground productivity; a relatively high proportion of C stored belowground; levels of soil microbial biomass and activity that are among the highest in native ecosystems in the United States; and the lack of a single dominant factor such as temperature, moisture, or nutrient availability, that consistently limits biotic processes during the growing season. The sensitivity of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie to different land use practices (fire and grazing) suggests that it is critical to include these factors in the development of grassland C budgets, as well as in regional models that estimate biogeochemical responses to land use change.2035^6^Lutze,JL^Roden,JS^Holly,CJ^Wolfe,J^Egerton,JJG^Ball,MC^1998^1^Elevated atmospheric [CO2] promotes frost damage in evergreen tree seedlings^9^21^6^631-635^^^^^Jun^^^^^6836130^perate ecosystems but are similar to estimates for tropical forests.

At the International Rice Research Institute, rice (cv IR72) was grown from germination until maturity for 4 field seasons, the 1994 and 1995 wet and the 1995 and 1996 dry seasons at three different CO2 concentrations (ambient, ambient + 200 and ambient + 300 mu L L-1 CO2) and two air temperatures (ambient and ambient + 4 degrees C) using open-top field chambers placed within a paddy site. Overall, enhanced levels of CO2 alone resulted in significant increases in total biomass at maturity and increased seed yield with the relative degree of enhancement consistent over growing seasons across both temperatures. Enhanced levels of temperature alone resulted in decreases or no change in total biomass and decreased seed yield at maturity across both CO2 levels. In general, simultaneous increases in air temperature as well as CO2 concentration offset the stimulation of biomass and grain yield compared to the effect of CO2 concentration alone. For either the 1995 wet and 1996 dry seasons, additional cultivars (N-22, NPT1 and NPT2) were grown in conjunction with IR72 at the same CO2 and temperature treatments. Among the cultivars tested, N-22 showed the greatest relative response of both yield and biomass to increasing CO2, while NPT2 showed no response and IR72 was intermediate. For all cultivars, however, the combination of increasing CO2 concentration and air temperature resulted in reduced grain yield and declining harvest index compared to increased CO2 alone. Data from these experiments indicate that (a) rice growth and yield can respond positively under tropical paddy conditions to elevated CO2, but that simultaneous exposure to elevated temperature may negate the CO2 response to grain yield; and, (b) sufficient intraspecific variation exists among cultivars for future selection of rice cultivars which may, potentially, convert greater amounts of CO2 into harvestable yield.2037^2^Neilson,RP^Drapek,RJ^1998^1^Potentially complex biosphere responses to transient global warming^127^4^5^505-521^^^^^Jun^^^^^68401234^1637^174^3110^3111^3112^314^55^633^673^ with IR72 at the same CO2 and temperature treatments.

Most previous analyses of biosphere responses to global warming have used output from equilibrium simulations of current and future climate, as compared to more recently available transient GCM simulations. We compared the vegetation responses to these two different classes of GCM simulation (equilibrium and transient) using an equilibrium vegetation distribution model, MAPSS. Average climatologies were extracted from the transient GCM simulations for current and doubled (2 x) CO2 concentrations (taken to be 2070-2099) for use by the equilibrium vegetation model. However, the 2 x CO2 climates extracted from the transient GCM simulations were not in equilibrium, having attained only about 65% of their eventual 2 x CO2 equilibrium temperature change. Most of the differences in global vegetation response appeared to be related to a very different simulated change in the pole to tropic temperature gradient. Also, the transient scenarios produced much larger increases of precipitation in temperate latitudes, commensurate with a minimum in the latitudinal temperature change. Thus, the (equilibrium) global vegetation response, under the transient scenarios, tends more to a greening than a decline in vegetation density, as often previously simulated. It may be that much of the world could become greener during the early phases of global warming, only to reverse in later, more equilibrial stages. However, whether or not the world's vegetation experiences large drought-induced declines or perhaps large vegetation expansions in early stages could be determined by the degree to which elevated CO2 will actually benefit natural vegetation, an issue still under debate. There may occur oscillations, perhaps on long timescales, between greener and drier phases, due to different frequency responses of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere interactions. Such oscillations would likely, of themselves, impart further reverberations to the coupled Earth System.2038^3^Peisker,M^Heinemann,I^Pfeffer,M^1998^1^A study on the relationship between leaf conductance, CO2 concentration and carboxylation rate in various species^91^56^1^35-43^^^^^Apr^^^^^68421754^1918^243^256^348^372^374^384^665^923^reening than a decline in vegetation density, as often previously simulated.

Such oscillatioA^6841^Leaf conductance g(L) is strongly influenced by environmental factors like CO2, irradiance and air humidity. According to Ball et al. (1987), g(L) is correlated with an index calculated as the product of net CO2 exchange rate A and ambient water vapour concentration W-a, divided by ambient CO2 concentration c(a). However, this empirical model does not apply to high values of g(L) observed at c(a) below CO2 compensation concentration Gamma. Therefore, we applied modified indices in which A is replaced by estimates for the rate of carboxylation. Such estimates, P-1 and P-2, were determined by adding to A the quotient of Gamma and the sum of gas phase resistance r(g) and intracellular resistance for CO2 exchange r(i), P-1 = A+Gamma/(r(g) + r(i)). or the quotient of Gamma and r(i), P-2 = A + Gamma/r(i). If P-2 is chosen, c(a) in the Ball index has to be replaced by the intercellular CO2 concentration c(i). By using the modified indices P-1.W-a/c(a) and P-2.W-a/c(i), we analysed data from the C-3 species Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, the C-3-C-4 intermediate species Diplotaxis tenuifolia, and the C-4 species Zea mays. The data were collected at widely varying levels of irradiance and CO2 concentration. For all species uniform relationships between g(L) and the new indices were found for the whole range of CO2 concentrations below and above Gamma. Correlations between g(L) and P-1.W-a/c(a) were closer than those between g(L) and P-2.W- a/c(i) because P-1/c(a) implicitly contains g(L). Highly significant correlations were also obtained for the relationships between g(L) and the ratios P-1/c(a) and P- 2/c(i).2039^1^Poorter,H^1998^1^Do slow-growing species and nutrient-stressed plants respond relatively strongly to elevated CO2?^127^4^6^693-697^^^^^Aug^^^^^6844224^229^243^341^344^361^437^57^682^975^chosen, c(a) in the Ball index has to be replaced by the intercellular CO2 concentration c(i).

However, an area which requires further study centers on nutrient dynamics of crops grown under elevated CO2 in the field. In 1989 and 1990, cotton [Gossypium hirsutum (L.) Deltapine 77'] was grown under two CO2 levels [370 mu mol mol(- 1)=ambient and 550 mu mol mol(-1)=free-air CO2 enrichment(FACE)]. At physiological maturity, nutrient concentration and content of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) were determined for whole plant and individual plant organs. While the effects of added CO2 on whole plant nutrient concentrations and contents were consistent, some differences among plant organs were observed between years. FACE often decreased tissue nutrient concentration, but increased total nutrient accumulation. Results indicate that under elevated CO2, field grown cotton was more nutrient efficient in terms of nutrient retrieval from the soil and nutrient utilization in the plant. This implies more efficient fertilizer utilization, better economic return for fertilizer expenditures, and reduced environmental impact from agricultural fertilization practices in the future.2041^1^Rosenthal,Y^1998^1^Variations of ecosystem gas exchange in the rain forest mesocosm at Biosphere 2 in response to elevated CO2^127^4^5^539-547^^^^^Jun^^^^^6848312^314^360^entration and content of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) were determined for whole plant and individual plant organs.

The ecosystem responses were assessed by comparing the whole-system net gas exchange (NEE) upon changing CO2 levels from 900 to 450 ppmV. The day-NEE was significantly higher in the elevated CO2 treatment. In both experiments, the NEE rates were similar to values observed in natural analogue systems. Variations in night-NEE, reflecting both soil CO2 efflux and plants respiration, covaried with temperature but showed no clear correlation with atmospheric CO2 levels. After correcting for changes in CO2 efflux we show that the rain forest net photosynthesis increased in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. The photosynthetic enhancement was expressed in higher quantum yields, maximum assimilation rates and radiation use efficiency. The results suggest that photosynthesis in large tropical trees is CO2 sensitive, at least following short exposures of days to weeks. Taken at face value, the data suggest that as a result of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, tropical rain forests may shift out of steady state, and become a carbon sink at least for short periods. However, a better understanding of the unique conditions and phenomena in Biosphere 2 is necessary before these results are broadly useful.2042^4^Saccardy,K^Pineau,B^Roche,O^Cornic,G^1998^1^Photochemical efficiency of Photosystem II and xanthophyll cycle components in Zea mays leaves exposed to water stress and high light^91^56^1^57-66^^^^^Apr^^^^^6850164^2092^2885^3113^3114^3115^3116^3117^3118^713^c CO2 levels.

For comparison, these parameters were followed under the same light conditions in well-hydrated leaves maintained either in normal or CO2-free air. The net CO2 assimilation of dehydrated leaves declined rapidly as their relative water content (RWC) decreased from 100 to 60% while the PS II efficiency measured after a prolonged dark period of 16 h declined only when RWC leaves was lower than 60%. Furthermore, drought caused an increase in the pool size of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and the presence of a sustained elevated level of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin at the end of the long dark period. The leaf water deficit enhanced the sensitivity of PS II efficiency to light exposure. During illumination, strong inhibition of PS II efficiency and large violaxanthin deepoxidation was observed in wilted leaves even under moderate photon flux density compared to control leaves in the same conditions. After 2 h of darkness following the light treatment, the PS II efficiency that is dependent on the previous PPFD, decreased with leaf water deficit. Moreover, zeaxanthin epoxidation led to an accumulation of antheraxanthin in dehydrated leaves, All these drought effects on PS II efficiency and xanthophyll cycle components were also obtained in well-hydrated leaves by short-term CO2 deprivation during illumination. We conclude that the increased susceptibility of PS II efficiency to light in wilted maize leaves is mainly explained by the decrease of CO2 availability and the resulting low net CO2 assimilation.2043^3^Saxe,H^Ellsworth,DS^Heath,J^1998^1^Tree and forest functioning in an enriched CO2 atmosphere^84^139^3^395-436^^^^^Jul^^^^^68521344^1633^3119^3120^3121^3122^3123^343^398^861^osure. During iA^6851^Forests exchange large amounts of CO2 with the atmosphere and can influence and be influenced by atmospheric CO2. There has been a recent proliferation of literature on the effects of atmospheric CO2 on forest trees. More than 300 studies of trees on five different continents have been published in the last five years. These include an increasing number of field studies with a long-term focus and involving CO2 x stress or environment interactions. The recent data on long-term effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on trees indicate a potential for a persistent enhancement of tree growth for several years, although the only relevant long-term datasets currently available are for juvenile trees. The current literature indicates a significantly larger average long-term biomass increment under elevated CO2 for conifers (130%) than for deciduous trees (49%) in studies not involving stress components. However, stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in long-term studies was similar for conifers (62 %) and deciduous trees (53 %). Recent studies indicate that elevated CO2 causes a more persistent stimulation of biomass increment and photosynthesis than previously expected. Results of seedling studies, however, might not be applicable to other stages of tree development because of complications of age- dependent and size-dependent shifts in physiology and carbon allocation, which are accelerated by elevated CO2. In addition, there are many possible avenues to down-regulation, making the predicted canopy CO2 exchange and growth of mature trees and forests in a CO2-rich atmosphere uncertain. Although, physiological down-regulation of photosynthetic rates has been documented in field situations, it is rarely large enough to offset entirely photosynthetic gains in elevated CO2. A persistent growth stimulation of individual mature trees has been demonstrated although this effect is more uncertain in trees in natural stands. Resource interactions can both constrain tree responses to elevated CO2 and be altered by them. Although drought can reduce gas-exchange rates and offset the benefits of elevated CO2, even in well watered trees, stomatal conductance is remarkably less responsive to elevated CO2 than in herbaceous species. Stomata of a number of tree species have been demonstrated to be unresponsive to elevated CO2. We conclude that positive effects of CO2 on leaf area can be at least as important in determining canopy transpiration as negative, direct effects of CO2 on stomatal aperture. With respect to nutrition, elevated CO2 has the potential to alter tree-soil interactions that might influence future changes in ecosystem productivity. There is continued evidence that in most cases nutrient limitations diminish growth and photosynthetic responses to elevated CO2 at least to some degree, and that elevated CO2 can accelerate the appearance of nutrient limitations with increasing time of treatment. In many studies, tree biomass responses to CO2 are artefacts in the sense that they are merely responses to CO2-induced changes in internal nutritional status of the tree. There are numerous interactions between CO2 and factors of the biotic and abiotic environment. The importance of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations for productivity is likely to be overestimated if these are not taken into account. Many interactions, however, are simply additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic. This appears to hold true for many parameters under elevated CO2 in combination with temperature, elevated O- 3, and other atmospheric pollutants. However, there is currently little evidence that elevated CO2 will counteract O-3 damage. When the foliage content of C, mineral nutrients and secondary metabolites is altered by elevated CO2, tree x insect interactions are modified. In most trees, mycorrhizal interactions might be less important for direct effects of CO2 than for alleviating general nutrient deficiencies. Since many responses to elevated CO2 and their interactions with stress show considerable variability among species/genotypes, one principal research need is for comparative studies of a large variety of woody species and ecosystems under realistic conditions. We still need more long-term experiments on mature trees and stands to address critical scaling issues likely to advance our understanding of responses to elevated CO2 at different stages of forest development and their interactions with climate and environment. The only tools available at present for coping with the consequences of rising CO2 are management of resources and selection of genotypes suitable for the future climate and environment.2044^3^Serraj,R^Sinclair,TR^Allen,LH^1998^1^Soybean nodulation and N-2 fixation response to drought under carbon dioxide enrichment^9^21^5^491-500^^^^^May^^^^^68541530^2843^3124^3125^3126^384^386^506^859^92^might be less important for direct effects of CO2 than for alleviating general nutrient deficiencies.

Under drought-stressed conditions, elevated [CO2] resulted in a delay in the decrease in Nz fixation rates associated,vith drying of the soil used in these experiments. The elevated [CO2] also allowed the plants under drought to sustain significant increases in nodule number and mass relative to those under ambient [CO2], The total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration was lower in the shoots of the plants exposed to drought; however, plants under elevated CO2 had much higher TNC levels than those under ambient CO2. For both [CO2] treatments, drought stress induced a substantial accumulation of TNC in the nodules that paralleled N-2 fixation decline, which indicates that nodule activity under drought may not be carbon limited. Under drought stress, ureide concentration increased in all plant tissues. However, exposure to elevated [CO2] resulted in substantially less drought- induced ureide accumulation in leaf and petiole tissues. A strong negative correlation was found between ureide accumulation and TNC levels in the leaves. This relationship, together with the large effect of elevated [CO2] on the decrease of ureide accumulation in the leaves, indicated the importance of ureide breakdown in the response of N-2 fixation to drought and of feedback inhibition by ureides on nodule activity. It is concluded that an important effect of CO2 enrichment on soybean under drought conditions is an enhancement of photoassimilation, an increased partitioning of carbon to nodules and a decrease of leaf ureide levels, which is associated with sustained nodule growth and N-2 rates under soil water deficits. We suggest that future [CO2] increases are likely to benefit soybean production by increasing the drought tolerance of N-2 fixation.2045^1^Sicher,RC^1998^1^Yellowing and photosynthetic decline of barley primary leaves in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment^37^103^2^193-200^^^^^Jun^^^^^68561672^2423^341^343^385^409^434^493^618^92^tissues.

Leaf yellowing; measured as changes of chlorophyll a and b, was more extensive in controlled environments at elevated (680 +/- 17 mu l l(-1)) than at ambient (380 +/- 21 mu l l(-1)) CO2. Stomatal conductance of primary leaves was decreased by growth in elevated CO2 between 11 and 18 days after sowing (DAS) when measured at both 380 and 680 mu l l(-1) CO2. Internal leaf CO2 concentration (C-i) was also lower for elevated- compared to ambient-CO2-grown primary leaves between 11 and 14 DAS. Results suggest that non-stomatal factors were responsible for the decreased photosynthetic rates of elevated- compared to ambient-CO2-grown primary leaves 18 DAS.

Plants were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe and given a phosphorus supply in the form of bonemeal, which would not be immediately available to the plants. Seven sequential harvests were taken to determine whether the effect of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizal colonization was independent of the effect of CO2 on plant growth. Plant growth analysis showed that both species grew faster in elevated CO2 and that P. lanceolata had increased carbon allocation towards the roots. Elevated CO, did not affect the percentage of root length colonized (RLC); although total colonized root length was greater, when plant size was taken into account this effect disappeared. This finding was also true for root length colonized by arbuscules. No CO2 effect was found on hyphal density (colonization intensity) in roots. The P content of plants was increased at elevated CO2, although both shoot and root tissue P concentration were unchanged. This was again as a result of bigger plants at elevated CO2. Phosphorus inflow was unaffected by CO2 concentrations. It is concluded that there is no direct permanent effect of elevated CO2, on mycorrhizal functioning, as internal mycorrhizal development and the mycorrhizal P uptake mechanism are unaffected. The importance of sequential harvests in experiments is discussed. The direction for future research is highlighted, especially in relation to C storage in the soil.2047^4^Tognetti,R^Longobucco,A^Miglietta,F^Raschi,A^1998^1^Transpiration and stomatal behaviour of Quercus ilex plants during the summer in a Mediterranean carbon dioxide spring^9^21^6^613-622^^^^^Jun^^^^^68601285^2712^3127^3128^3129^343^344^372^384^91^is effect disappeared.

Trees at the spring site have been growing for generations in elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At both sites, maximum leaf conductance was related to predawn shoot water potential. The effects of water deficits on water relations and whole- plant transpiration during the summer drought were severe. Leaf conductance and water potential recovered after major rainfall in September to predrought values. Sap flow leaf conductance and predawn water potential decreased in parallel with increases in hydraulic resistance, reaching a minimum in mid- summer. These relationships are in agreement with the hypothesis of the stomatal control of transpiration to prevent desiccation damage but also to avoid 'runaway embolism'. Trees at the CO2 spring underwent less reduction in hydraulic resistance for a given value of predawn water potential. The decrease in leaf conductance caused by elevated CO2 was limited and tended to be less at high than at low atmospheric vapour pressure deficit.

A strong association between foliage area and sapwood cross-sectional area was found in both the control and the CO2 spring trees, the latter supporting a smaller foliage area at the corresponding sapwood stem cross- sectional area. The specific leaf area (SLA) of the foliage was not influenced by site. The results are discussed in terms of the effects of elevated CO2 on plant water use at the organ and whole-tree scale.2048^2^Winter,K^Virgo,A^1998^1^Elevated CO2 enhances growth in the rain forest understory plant, Piper cordulatum, at extremely low light intensities^54^193^3^323-326^^^^^Jul^^^^^68622297^312^344^374^376^389^494^713^ site trees than in the CO2 spring trees.

Although sources of each gas have been evaluated independently, little attention has focused on potential interactions between gases which could influence emission rates. In the current experiment, the effect of enhanced CO2 (300 mu L L-1 above ambient) and/or air temperature (4 degrees C above ambient) on methane generation and emission were determined for the irrigated tropical paddy rice system over 3 consecutive field seasons (1995 wet and dry seasons 1996 dry season). For all three seasons, elevated CO2 concentration resulted in a significant increase in dissolved soil methane relative to the ambient control. Consistent with the observed increases in soil methane, measurements of methane flux per unit surface area during the 1995 wet and 1996 dry seasons also showed a significant increase at elevated carbon dioxide concentration relative to the ambient CO2 condition (+49 and 60% for each season, respectively). Growth of rice at both increasing CO2 concentration and air temperature did not result in additional stimulation of either dissolved or emitted methane compared to growth at elevated CO2 alone.

We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and drought on leaf water relations of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Bragg] and considered the hypothesis of osmotic adjustment mediated by increased photosynthesis (Hypothesis 1) vs. the hypothesis of water conservation mediated by decreased stomatal conductance (Hypothesis 2) to explain improved water relations of plants growing under elevated CO2. In Exp. 1, soybean was grown at 330, 450, 660, and 800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 in sunlit, closed- circulation, controlled-environment chambers under well-watered conditions. Leaf total water potential (WP), osmotic potential (OP), and turgor potential (TP) were measured at midday during V4 to R6 stages of development. In Exp. 2 (well-watered, R1-R3) and Exp. 3 (13-d drying cycle, R6 seed filling), soybean was grown at 330 and 660 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and WP, OP, and TP were measured five times per day on sunlit and shaded leaves. In Exp. 3, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration rate (TR) of leaves were also measured. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that elevated CO2 increased TP and decreased OP, but did not affect leaf WP, thus favoring Hypothesis 1. In Exp. 3, leaf WP was higher in elevated than ambient CO2. Diurnal TP was higher in elevated than ambient CO2 at the beginning of drought, and was maintained longer each day as drought progressed. At the end of drought, TP and WP was higher in elevated than ambient CO2. Elevated CO2 leaves had lower TR because of lower g(s) than ambient CO2 counterparts. Thus, Exp. 3 supported Hypothesis 2, that both stressed and nonstressed plants in elevated CO2 have a better water status (e.g., higher TP) than plants in ambient CO2 due to water conservation mediated by decreased g(s).

Foliar H2O2, ascorbate, and glutathione contents were comparable in all lines of plants. Irradiance-dependent changes in net CO, assimilation and chlorophyll a fluorescence quenching parameters were similar in all lines both in air (21% O-2) and at low (1%) O-2. CO2-response curves for photosynthesis showed similar net CO2-exchange characteristics in all lines.

Bragg and its supernodulating mutant nts 1007 were grown in pots containing vermiculite with a N-free nutrient solution in order to examine the effect of elevated CO2 concentration (100+20 Pa CO2) on biomass production, photosynthesis, and biological nitrogen fixation. The whole plant weight increase in Bragg was higher than in the mutant at a high CO2 concentration. Apparent photosynthetic activities of the upper leaves in both Bragg and the mutant increased up to 14 d after treatment initiation by the CO2 enrichment and thereafter decreased to some extent. Both leaf area and leaf thickness of Bragg increased more than in nts 1007. With the elevated CO2 concentration, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) also responded in the same manner as biomass production in both Bragg and nts 1007. The increase of BNF in Bragg was largely due to an increase in nodule weight. Starch contents in the leaves of both Bragg and the mutant increased significantly by CO2 enrichment, with a higher increase in Bragg than in its mutant. Sugar content in leaf differed only slightly in both Bragg and the mutant. N content in leaf decreased in both Bragg and its mutant, with the decrease being more pronounced in Bragg. However, in other plant parts (roots, stem, and petiole + pods), N content increased in the mutant while in Bragg, it decreased in the pod. N accumulation rate was higher in Bragg than in the mutant and increased more in Bragg than in the mutant by CO2 enrichment. The ureide content in leaf decreased in Bragg but increased in the mutant by elevated CO2 concentration. In the nodules, ureide content increased in both Bragg and the mutant by CO2 enrichment. Based on these results, it is suggested that in terms of biomass production and photosynthetic rate, Bragg responded more to elevated CO2 concentration than its mutant nts 1007. The alleviation of the stunted vegetative growth of the mutant by CO2 enrichment was limited despite the significant increase in the photosynthetic activity, presumably due to the limitation of sink activity in the growing parts and not to insufficient supply of N through BNF.2056^1^Colinvaux,PA^1998^1^A new vicariance model for Amazonian endemics^175^7^2^95-96^^^^^Mar^^^^^68763136^A^6875^It is unlikely that ice age climates of the Amazon were sufficiently arid to fragment the forest as required by the Haffer refugial hypothesis.

Relative to plants grown at 380 pmol mol(-1) and 25/20 degrees C, whole plant biomass was 36% less at 380 mu mol mol(-1) x 36/29 degrees C, and 37% less at 200 mu mol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C, Most significantly, growth at 200 mu mol mol(- 1) x 36/29 degrees C resulted in 77% less biomass relative to plants grown at 380 pmol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C, The net CO2 assimilation rate of leaves grown in 200 mu mol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C was 40% lower than in leaves from 380 pmol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C, but similar to leaves in 200 mu mol mol(-1) x 36/29 degrees C. The leaves produced in low CO2 and high temperature respired at a rate that was double that of leaves from the 380 mu mol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C treatment. Despite this, there was little evidence that leaves at low CO2 and high temperature were carbohydrate deficient, because soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrates of leaves from the 200 mu mol mol(-1) x 36/29 degrees C treatment were not significantly different in leaves from the 380 mu mol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C treatment. Similarly, there was no significant difference in percentage root carbon, leaf chlorophyll and leaf/root nitrogen between the low CO2 x high temperature treatment and ambient CO2 controls. Decreased plant growth was correlated with neither leaf gas exchange nor tissue chemistry. Rather, leaf and root growth were the most affected responses, declining in equivalent proportions as total biomass production. Because of this close association, the mechanisms controlling leaf and root growth appear to have the greatest control over the response to heat stress and CO2 reduction in P. vulgaris.2060^2^Gallardo,A^Merino,J^1998^1^Soil nitrogen dynamics in response to carbon increase in a Mediterranean shrubland of SW Spain^130^30^10-11^1349-1358^^^^^Sep^^^^^68841298^20^2102^3138^3139^362^417^535^672^733^s, starch and total non-structural carbohydrates of leaves from the 200 mu mol mol(-1) x 36/29 degrees C treatment were not significantly different in leaves from the 380 mu mol mol(-1) x 25/20 degrees C treatment.

The effect of an increase in the soil C-to-N ratio on the nitrogen dynamics in a Mediterranean shrubland was simulated by mixing with the lifter layer wood shavings with a high C-to-N ratio. Samples of mineral soil, taken subsequently eight times during 404 d, were analyzed for total C, total N, total soil carbohydrates, potential net N mineralization, potential net nitrification and microbial biomass-N. We found significant increases in the concentration of total carbohydrates, C-to-N ratio and microbial biomass N in amended soils during the experiment, while potential net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate significantly decreased; amounts of available nitrogen (NH4+-N + NO3-N) were unaffected by the amendment treatment. However, by the end of the experiment, no significant differences between amended and control soil samples were found. The total carbohydrates-to-K2SO4-extractable total-N ratio was the best predictor of both net mineralization rate and microbial biomass N, showing that the available C-to- available-N ratio is a better indicator of N dynamics than the total C to total N ratio. Our results support the hypothesis that increasing C availability in soils leads to a decrease in N availability for plants through the immobilization of N in microbial biomass and to an increase in the temporal heterogeneity of soil properties in a Mediterranean shrubland.

The model takes into consideration both local ecosystem processes within a patch or grid cell, such as plant growth and death, and mass and energy flow, such as plant migration, across adjacent grid cells. The model is able to couple vegetation structure dynamics and primary production processes. The normalized differential vegetation index from meteorological satellite AVHRR was used to parameterize the model. Plant migration rates were derived based on effective seedling distribution around parent plants. The model was applied to Northeast China Transect at a spatial resolution of 10 min latitude by 10 min longitude per grid cell and a temporal resolution of 1 month. The results indicated that with doubled CO2 concentration, a 20% increase in precipitation and a 4 degrees C increase in temperature, the model predicted that net primary productivity (NPP) of Larix forests, conifer-broadleaf mixed forests, Aneurolepidium chinense steppes, Stipa grandis steppes, and wetland and salty meadows would decrease by 15% to 20%. However, NPP of deciduous broadleaf forests, woodland and shrubs, Stipa baicalensis meadow steppes, and desert grasslands would increase by 20% to 115%, as predicted by the model for the same climatic scenario. The average NPP of natural vegetation over the whole transect would decrease slightly, largely because of the compensation between the positive effects of increased CO2 and precipitation and the negative effect of increased evapotranspiration induced by increased temperature.2062^9^Geiger,M^Walch-Liu,P^Engels,C^Harnecker,J^Schulze,ED^Ludewig,F^Sonnewald,U^Scheible,WR^Stitt,M^1998^1^Enhanced carbon dioxide leads to a modified diurnal rhythm of nitrate reductase activity in older plants, and a large stimulation of nitrate reductase activity and higher levels of amino acids in young tobacco plants^9^21^3^253-268^^^^^Mar^^^^^6888ty (NPP1437^2249^229^3141^372^376^448^504^57^92^d forests, Aneurolepidium chinense steppes, Stipa grandis steppes, and wetland and salty meadows would decrease by 15% to 20%.

To investigate how this is achieved, tobacco plants were grown on high nitrate and high light in ambient and enhanced (700 mu mol mol(-1)) carbon dioxide. Surprisingly, enhanced carbon dioxide did not increase leaf nitrate reductase (MR) activity in the middle of the photoperiod. Possible reasons for this anomalous result were investigated. (a) Measurements of biomass, nitrate, amino acids and glutamine in plants fertilized once and twice daily with 12 mol m(-3) nitrate showed that enhanced carbon dioxide did not lead to a nitrate limitation in these plants. (b) Enhanced carbon dioxide modified the diurnal regulation of NR activity in source leaves. The transcript for nia declined during the light period in a similar manner in ambient and enhanced carbon dioxide. The decline of the transcript correlated with a decrease of nitrate in the leaf, and was temporarily reversed after re-irrigating with nitrate in the second part of the photoperiod. The decline of the transcript was not correlated with changes of sugars or glutamine. NR activity and protein decline in the second part of the photoperiod, and NR is inactivated in the dark in ambient carbon dioxide. The decline of NR activity was smaller and dark inactivation was partially reversed in enhanced carbon dioxide, indicating that post- transcriptional or post-translational regulation of NR has been modified. The increased activation and stability of NR in enhanced carbon dioxide was correlated with higher sugars and lower glutamine in the leaves. (c) Enhanced carbon dioxide led to increased levels of the minor amino acids in leaves. (d) Enhanced carbon dioxide led to a large decrease of glycine and a small decrease of serine in leaves of mature plants. The glycine:serine ratio decreased in source leaves of older plants and seedlings. The consequences of a lower rate of photorespiration for the levels of glutamine and the regulation of nitrogen metabolism are discussed. (e) Enhanced carbon dioxide also modified the diurnal regulation of NR in roots. The nia transcript increased after nitrate fertilization in the early and the second part of the photoperiod. The response of the transcript was not accentuated in enhanced carbon dioxide. NR activity declined slightly during the photoperiod in ambient carbon dioxide, whereas it increased 2-fold in enhanced carbon dioxide. The increase of root NR activity in enhanced carbon dioxide was preceded by a transient increase of sugars, and was followed by a decline of sugars, a faster decrease of nitrate than in ambient carbon dioxide, and an increase of nitrite in the roots. (f) To interpret the physiological significance of these changes-in nitrate metabolism, they were compared with the current growth rate of the plants. (g) In 4-5-week-old plants, the current rate of growth was similar in ambient and enhanced carbon dioxide (approximate to 0.4 g(-1) d(-1)). Enhanced carbon dioxide only led to small changes of NR activity, nitrate decreased, and overall amino acids were not significantly increased. (h) Young seedlings had a high growth rate (0.5 g(-1) d(-1)) in ambient carbon dioxide, that was increased by another 20% in enhanced carbon dioxide. Enhanced carbon dioxide led to larger increases of NR activity and NR activation, a 2-3-fold increase of glutamine, a 50% increase of glutamate, and a 2-3-fold increase in minor amino acids. It also led to a higher nitrate level. It is argued that enhanced carbon dioxide leads to a very effective stimulation of nitrate uptake, nitrate assimilation and amino acid synthesis in seedlings. This will play an important role in allowing faster growth rates in enhanced carbon dioxide at this stage.2063^6^Hodge,A^Paterson,E^Grayston,SJ^Campbell,CD^Ord,BG^Killham,K^1998^1^Characterisation and microbial utilisation of exudate material from the rhizosphere of Lolium perenne grown under CO2 enrichment^130^30^8-9^1033-1043^^^^^Aug^^^^^68901096^1262^1803^2364^312^361^57^733^738^778^ NR aA^6889^The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on alterations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of exuded compounds from the roots of Lolium perenne seedlings were investigated by growing plants in a sterilised sand microcosm unit. In addition, the effect of CO2 treatment on carbon substrate utilisation of microbial populations extracted from the rhizosphere of L. perenne seedlings grown in soil microcosm units was examined and alterations on microbial activity and diversity assessed using a commercially-available redox-based sole C source utilisation test (Biolog(R)) including additional exudate compounds. Both types of microcosm units (sand and soil) were maintained at specific growth conditions under two CO2 regimes (450 and 720 mu mol mol(-1)). Growth of L. perenne seedlings from both types of microcosm units was enhanced under elevated atmospheric CO2 although the root-to-shoot ratios were not significantly altered, indicating no gross change in dry matter partitioning. Cumulative total organic carbon (TOC) release in the exudate material over the duration of the experiment was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher from ambient-grown seedlings despite a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) increase in the dry weight of roots of the elevated CO2 grown seedlings as determined at harvest. Over the individual sampling periods TOC release was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher from elevated CO2 grown seedlings on only one occasion (21 d). Qualitative differences, measured between d 1-6 and 14-18, also occurred with elevated CO2 treatment decreasing the amount of phenolic acids and total sugars at the latter sampling period compared to ambient CO2 seedlings. Total numbers of bacteria were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) decreased under elevated CO2 although culturable numbers significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) increased. This increase in culturable microorganisms may explain the faster carbon source utilisation rates of the elevated CO2 treatment.

To investigate daily and seasonal responses of CO2 exchange to elevated O-3 and CO2, the CO2 exchange of shoots was measured continuously by an automatic system for measuring gas exchange during the course of one year (from 1 Januray to 31 December 1996). A process-based model of shoot photosynthesis was constructed to quantify modifications in the intrinsic capacity of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance by simulating the daily CO2 exchange data from the field. Results showed that on most days of the year the model simulated well the daily course of shoot photosynthesis. Elevated O-3 significantly decreased photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance during the whole photosynthetic period. Elevated O-3 also led to a delay in onset of photosynthetic recovery in early spring and an increase in the sensitivity of photosynthesis to environmental stress conditions.

The leaf anatomy of the young oaks was compared with that of fossil leaves of the same species. In the experiments, stomatal density and stomatal index were significantly decreased at elevated [CO2] in comparison to ambient [CO2]. Elevated [CO2] induced leaf cell expansion and reduced the intercellular air space by 35%. Leaf cell size or length were also stimulated at high air humidity and temperature. Regardless of a temperate or subtropical palaeoclimate, leaf cell size in fossil oak was not enhanced, since neither epidermal cell density nor length of the stomatal apparatus changed. The absence of these effects may be attributed to the phenological response of trees to climatic changes that balanced temporal changes in environmental variables to maintain leaf growth under optimal and stable conditions.

Yield and fibre characters responded to variation of daily mean and amplitude of temperature. Mean temperature reduction improved yield components, but fibre length, uniformity, strength and micronaire were increased by high, particularly high day, temperatures. A large daily temperature amplitude produced an intermediate number of flowers and the lowest retention percentage. Fruiting and yield were increased by reduction in temperature down to the threshold mean temperature of 22 degrees C. However, V-regimes with a low minimum temperature acted as a further drop (below 22 degrees C) of temperature and adversely affected these characters, An adverse effect of low minimum temperature combined with a moderate day temperature was observed also on lint percentage and fibre properties.

Under these conditions, a wide variety of species accumulates non-structural carbohydrates in leaves, It has been proposed that starch accumulation directly inhibits photosynthesis, that the rate of sucrose and starch synthesis limits photosynthesis, or that accumulation of sugars triggers changes in gene expression resulting in loser activities of Rubisco and inhibition of photosynthesis. To distinguish these explanations, transgenic plants unable to accumulate transient starch due to leaf mesophyll-specific antisense expression of AGP B were grown at ambient and elevated carbon dioxide.

The cycles are closely linked at all scales, and global change analyses must consider C and N cycles together. The increasing amount of N originating from fossil fuel combustion and deposited to terrestrial ecosystems as nitrogen oxides could increase the capacity of ecosystems to sequester C, thereby removing some of the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and slowing the development of greenhouse warming. Several global and ecosystem models have calculated the amount of C sequestration that can be attributed to N deposition, based on assumptions about the allocation of N among ecosystem components with different C:N ratios. They support the premise that, since industrialization began, N deposition has been responsible for an increasing terrestrial C sink, but there is great uncertainty whether ecosystems will continue to retain exogenous N. Whether terrestrial ecosystems continue to sequester additional C will depend in part on their response to increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, widely thought to be constrained by limited N availability. Ecosystem models generally support the conclusion that responses to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide will be greater, and the range of possible responses will be wider, in ecosystems where increased N inputs originate as atmospheric deposition. The interactions between N deposition and increasing carbon dioxide concentrations could be altered considerably, however, by additional factors, including N saturation of ecosystems, changes in community composition, and climate change, Nitrogen deposition is also linked to global change issues through the volatile losses of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and the role of nitrogen oxides in the production of tropospheric ozone, which could interact with plant responses to elevated carbon dioxide. Any consideration of the role of N deposition in global change issues must also balance the projected responses against the serious detrimental impact of excess N on the environment.2072^9^Osborne,CP^LaRoche,J^Garcia,RL^Kimball,BA^Wall,GW^Pinter,PJ^LaMorte,RL^Hendrey,GR^Long,SP^1998^1^Does leaf position within a canopy affect acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated CO2?

We examined acclimation in a vertical profile of leaves through a canopy of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The crop was grown at an elevated CO2 partial pressure of 55 Pa within a replicated field experiment using free-air CO2 enrichment. Cas exchange was used to estimate in vivo carboxylation capacity and the maximum rate of ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate-limited photosynthesis. Net photosynthetic CO2 uptake was measured for leaves in situ within the canopy. Leaf contents of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), light-harvesting-complex (LHC) proteins, and total N were determined. Elevated CO2 did not affect carboxylation capacity in the most recently expanded leaves but led to a decrease in lower, shaded leaves during grain development. Despite this acclimation, in situ photosynthetic CO2 uptake remained higher under elevated CO2. Acclimation at elevated CO2 was accompanied by decreases in both Rubisco and total leaf N contents and an increase in LHC content.

The results presented here suggest that (1) across the transect climate change would result in increased total carbon in vegetation biomass but decreased overall carbon in soil; (2) increased atmospheric CO2 concentration under current climatic patterns would result in increased total carbon in vegetation and in soil organic matter; and (3) combined climate change and elevated CO2 would increase both net primary productivity and decomposition rates relative to the current climate condition, but their combined action would be a reduction of soil carbon losses relative to those due to climate change alone.

Maximum photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and CO2 response curves were measured over the fourth growing season with a portable photosynthesis system. The photosynthesis model developed by Farquhar et al. (1980) was fitted to the CO2 response curves. Chlorophyll, soluble proteins, total nonstructural carbohydrates, nitrogen and Rubisco activity were determined monthly. Elevated CO2 concentration stimulated photosynthesis by 33% on average over the fourth growing season. However, comparison of maximum photosynthetic rates at the same CO2 concentration (350 or 700 mu mol mol(-1)) revealed that the photosynthetic capacity of trees grown in an elevated CO2 concentration was reduced. Analysis of the response curves showed that acclimation to elevated CO2 concentration involved decreases in carboxylation efficiency and RuBP regeneration capacity. No clear evidence for a redistribution of nitrogen within the leaf was observed. Down-regulation of photosynthesis increased as the growing season progressed and appeared to be related to the source-sink balance of the trees. Analysis of the main leaf components revealed that the reduction in photosynthetic capacity was accompanied by an accumulation of starch in leaves (100%), which was probably responsible for the reduction in Rubisco activity (27%) and to a lesser extent for reductions in other photosynthetic components: chlorophyll (10%), soluble protein (9%), and N concentrations (12%) expressed on an area basis. Despite a 21% reduction in stomatal conductance in response to the elevated CO2 treatment, stomatal limitation was significantly less in the elevated, than in the ambient, CO2 treatment. Thus, after four growing seasons exposed to an elevated CO2 concentration in the field, the trees maintained increased photosynthetic rates, although their photosynthetic capacity was reduced compared With trees grown in ambient CO2.2075^2^Rouhier,H^Read,DJ^1998^1^The role of mycorrhiza in determining the response of Plantago lanceolata to CO2 enrichment^84^139^2^367-373^^^^^Jun^^^^^69131096^1334^1850^1983^2070^2467^312^474^672^733^ysis of the main leaf components revealed that the reduction in photosynthetic capacity was accompanied by an accumulation of starch in leaves (100%), which was probably responsible for the reduction in Rubisco activity (27%) and to a lesser extent for reductions in other photosynthetic components: chlorophyll (10%), soluble protein (9%), and N concentrations (12%) expressed on an area basis.

Sequential harvests (H) were taken at 41 (H-1), 76 (H-2) and 104 d (H-3) to determine the time-course of mycorrhizal influence on the response of the plant to CO2 enrichment. Total yields of M plants were greater than those of NM from H-2 onwards. Plants in the M-ELEV treatment were significantly larger than those in the M-AMB at 104 d. There were significant but much smaller differences in yield between NMELEV and NMAMB. The differences in total yield arose through impact of C-ELEV on both shoots and roots. Total root length was greater in M-ELEV than in M-AMB only at H-3, but total length of mycorrhizal root was greater at H-2 and H-3. The percentages of root length colonized and that occupied by arbuscules and vesicles were greater in M-ELEV than in M-AMB at the last two harvests, indicating increased sequestration of carbon in internal fungal structures. Though extraradical hyphal lengths were greater in M-ELEV than in M-AMB at H-2 and H-3, the differences were not significant. Phosphorus inflow and P content of M plants were higher than those of NM plants at H-2 and H-3, and were higher in M-ELEV than in M-AMB at H-3. ANOVA revealed no significant interactions between CO2 and mycorrhizal treatment. The results are discussed in relation to carbon sequestration in mycorrhizal systems and likely impacts of CO2 enrichment on P. lanceolata grown under field conditions.

During this time period several examples of the depression of photosynthetic activities were observed for E needles. In order to better characterize the nature of this depression the gas exchange and fluorescence parameters were analyzed on current year needles during the last season (July 1995). The photon flux density response curves of CO2 uptake (P-N) revealed a significantly reduced stimulation of P-N for E needles as compared with short-term exposure to doubled CO2. Moreover, the sudden exposure of E shoots to 350 mu mol(CO2)mol(-1) at saturating irradiance revealed a depression of both P-Nmax (by 20 %) and quantum yield of PS II (by 32 %) compared with A shoots measured at 350 mu mol(CO2)mol(-1). The data supporting the diminished light harvesting system of photosystem II (PS II) in E shoots compared with A shoots were obtained from pigment analysis, low temperature fluorescence spectra and Chl a fluorescence induction kinetics. The relative proportion of inactive reaction centres of PS II determined from F-pl of the fluorescence induction was 20 % higher for E needles. These changes found for E needles mimicked an adaptation of PS II to increased irradiance compared with A needles. As the irradiance exposure was the same for the examined needles from both E and A spruces we suggest that these changes reported for E needles resulted from the feed-back limitation of photochemical reactions due to suppressed electron transport through the plastoquinone pool.2077^4^Tognetti,R^Johnson,JD^Michelozzi,M^Raschi,A^1998^1^Response of foliar metabolism in mature trees of Quercus pubescens and Quercus ilex to long-term elevated CO2^173^39^3^233-245^^^^^Jun^^^^^69171120^1144^130^1342^243^3150^345^376^377^384^The data supporting the diminished light harvesting system of photosystem IA^6916^Long-term effects on and adaptations of the carbon physiology of long-lived trees exposed to increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 are unknown. We compared two indigenous Quercus species, Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, growing in a natural CO2 spring located in central Italy and at a nearby control site. In May, 1995 photosynthetic rate at least doubled when measured with supplemental CO2 in both species and sites. Dark respiration was much higher at the CO2 spring site in both species. Foliar sugar and starch concentrations in Q. ilex exhibited significant site and diurnal differences (May and September). In July, 1995 there was little difference in the water potential values of the measured trees at the different sites over the diurnal period. Photosynthetic rate was higher for both species in the CO2 spring, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon. Mid-day stomatal closure reduced photosynthesis to similar levels. In the morning leaf conductance and transpiration were generally lower in the CO2 spring trees, contributing to higher instantaneous water use efficiency for both species. Isoprene emission rates were higher in Q. pubescens trees growing in the CO2 spring. The maximum difference between control and CO2 spring trees occurred in late afternoon. In contrast, Q. ilex exhibited isoprene emission near background level. Foliage and branch carbon and nitrogen status showed increased concentrations of starch and tannins in Q. ilex and of soluble sugars in Q. pubescens in the elevated CO2 environment, while nitrogen concentration decreased in both species.

Hull). Plants were pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-14 at ambient and elevated CO2 and two nitrogen regimes (low and high). After harvesting the plants, the soil was incubated to monitor total respiration and decomposition of C- 14-labeled rhizodeposits. Total and shoot biomass increased at high N but were not affected by CO2. Root biomass was not affected by either N or CO2 treatments. Total C-14 uptake and shoot-C-14 increased upon adding N and elevating CO2 but the N effect was strongest. Total C-14 uptake per unit shoot mass decreased with N, but increased with CO2. Root-C-14 content was not significantly affected by the N or CO2 treatment. Total soil-C-14 slightly increased at elevated CO2 whereas microbial C-14 increased due to high N. C allocation to shoots increased at the expense of roots, soil and respiration at high N but was not affected by the CO2 treatment. Variation in C-14 distribution within each treatment was small compared to variation in total C-14 amounts in each plant-soil compartment. Initially, C-14 respiration from rhizodeposits correlated well with root-C-14, total soil-C-14, soil solution-C-14 and microbial C-14, at harvest time and was increased by elevated CO2. By the end of the incubation, however, decomposition of labeled organic matter was not affected by the treatments whereas total (=C-12+C-14) respiration was lowest for the elevated-CO2 soils. We speculate that initially, respiration is dominated by decomposition of fresh root exudates whereas in the longer term, respiration originates from decomposition of more recalcitrant root material that had been formed during the entire experiment. The increased net C-14 uptake and unchanged distribution pattern, combined with an increased decomposition of easily-decomposable compounds and a decreased decomposition of more recalcitrant root-derived material indicated a small sink function of a Calluna plant-soil system under elevated CO2.

Although the photosynthetic rate became less stimulate over time, a significant stimulation of whole plant photosynthesis and plant dry weight was observed at the elevated CO2 concentration during the experimental period irrespective of soil temperature. At neither carbon dioxide concentration did the warmer soil temperature (30 degrees C) stimulate whole plant growth compared to a soil temperature of 25 degrees C, but it did increase root growth relative to shoot (top) growth with a subsequent increase in root/shoot ratio. Increasing soil temperature at either carbon dioxide concentration also significantly stimulated whole plant photosynthetic rate. However, the degree of stimulation was reduced with time irrespective of carbon dioxide concentration so that at 21 DAS no difference in photosynthesis between ambient and elevated soil temperatures was observed. Data from this experiment indicate that for soybean, a higher soil temperature stimulates root/shoot ratio and enhances photosynthetic response to elevated carbon dioxide in the short-term (i.e. days), but increasing root/shoot ratios does not provide a satisfactory explanation of long-term stimulation of photosynthesis at elevated levels of carbon dioxide.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) grown as an energy crop could reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation by replacing fossil fuels and sequestering C. It could also improve soil productivity by C sequestration, and reduce NO3-1 contamination of water by absorbing N lost from fertilizer and agricultural waste if planted in filter strips on adjacent land. The objective of this study was to assess potential impacts of switchgrass on C and N balances by reviewing and synthesizing information from current literature, unpublished data and on-going research. Replacing fossil fuels with switchgrass, or any other biomass, will have a much greater effect on atmospheric CO2 than C sequestration. This is because replacing fossil fuels provides a cumulative effect, while C sequestration offers only a one-time benefit. Furthermore, switchgrass will provide net gains in C sequestration only if it replaces annual row crops, but not if it replaces grazed pasture. Nitrogen recovery by switchgrass in an Alabama study was 65.6%, which compares favorably with the 50% recovery frequently quoted as the norm for wheal (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L).

In N-rich grassland, [CO2] doubling quickly increased net primary productivity (NPP), total carbon (C-sys) and plant biomass by about 30%. By contrast, the N-poor grassland underwent a prolonged 'transient', when there was little response, but eventually NPP, C-sys and plant biomass more than doubled. The 'transient' was due to N immobilization and severe depletion of the soil mineral N pool. The large long-term response was due to slow N accumulation, as a result of decreased leaching, decreased gaseous N losses and increased N- 2-fixation, which amplified the CO2 response much more in the N-poor than in the N-rich grassland. It was concluded that (i) ecosystems use extra carbon fixed at high [CO2] to acquire and retain nutrients, supporting the contention of Gifford et al.

Schott and Bauhinia multinervia (H.B.K.) DC. growing near natural cold CO2 springs. Xylem water potential in plants of both species was lowered by drought, high CO2 growth-concentration decreasing it further in S. cannifolium. In plants of both species growing under high CO2 concentration photosynthetic rates measured at a CO2 mole fraction of 1000 mu mol mol(-1) were higher than in plants growing at ambient CO2 mole fraction and measured at 350 mu mol mol(-1). The response was the result of a direct effect of CO2 on the photosynthetic machinery. Changes in carboxylation efficiency in response to high CO2 were found during the rainy season, with an increase in S. cannifolium and a decrease in B. multinervia; a significant interaction between growth CO2 concentration and season in B. multinervia resulted from significant effects of both factors. An increase in intrinsic water-use efficiency due to high CO2 was determined in both species by an increase in photosynthetic rate as well as a decrease in leaf conductance. In high-CO2 plants of S. cannifolium a 71 % decrease in stomatal density and 73 % in stomatal index suggested that CO2 affected stomatal initiation, whereas in B. multinervia an 85 % decrease in stomatal index and a 72 % decrease in stomatal density indicated that CO2 influenced stomatal initiation as well as epidermal cell expansion. Our results indicate that very high CO2 concentrations did not inhibit photosynthesis in these species, and that growth under high CO2 allowed plants to attain carbon balances higher than those of plants growing under low CO2.

Photosynthesis and concurrent export rates were estimated during isotopic equilibrium of the transport sugars using a steady-state (CO2)-C-14-labeling procedure. At ambient CO2 photosynthesis and export rates for C-3 species were 5 to 15 and 1 to 10 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1), respectively, and 20 to 30 and 15 to 22 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for C-4 species. A linear regression plot of export on photosynthesis rate of all species had a correlation coefficient of 0.87. When concurrent export was expressed as a percentage of photosynthesis, several C-3 dicots that produced transport sugars other than Suc had high efflux rates relative to photosynthesis, comparable to those of C-4 species. At high CO2 photosynthetic and export rates were only slightly altered in C, species, and photosynthesis increased but export rates did not in all C(3)species. The C-3 species that had high efflux rates relative to photosynthesis at ambient CO2 exported at rates comparable to those of C-4 species on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of photosynthesis. At ambient CO2 there were strong linear relationships between photosynthesis, sugar synthesis, and concurrent export. However, at high CO2 the relationships between photosynthesis and export rate and between sugar synthesis and export rate were not as strong because sugars and starch were accumulated.2088^3^Hunt,HW^Morgan,JA^Read,JJ^1998^1^Simulating growth and root-shoot partitioning in prairie grasses under elevated atmospheric CO2 and water stress^52^81^4^489-501^^^^^Apr^^^^^6938137^2139^230^314^374^407^423^427^494^57^t produced transport sugars other than Suc had high efflux rates relative to photosynthesis, comparable to those of C-4 species.

TA^6937^We constructed a model simulating growth, shoot-root partitioning, plant nitrogen (N) concentration and total nonstructural carbohydrates in perennial grasses. Carbon (C) allocation was based on the concept of a functional balance between root and shoot growth, which responded to variable plant C and N supplies. Interactions between the plant and environment were made explicit by way of variables for soil water and soil inorganic N. The model was fitted to data on the growth of two species of perennial grass subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 and water stress treatments. The model exhibited complex feedbacks between plant and environment, and the indirect effects of CO2 and water treatments on soil water and soil inorganic N supplies were important in interpreting observed plant responses. Growth was surprisingly insensitive to shoot-root partitioning in the model, apparently because of the limited soil N supply, which weakened the expected positive relationship between root growth and total N uptake. Alternative models for the regulation of allocation between shoots and roots were objectively compared by using optimization to find the least squares fit of each model to the data. Regulation by various combinations of C and N uptake rates, C and N substrate concentrations, and shoot and root biomass gave nearly equivalent fits to the data, apparently because these variables were correlated with each other. A partitioning function that maximized growth predicted too high a root to shoot ratio, suggesting that partitioning did not serve to maximize growth under the conditions of the experiment (C) 1998 Annals of Botany Company.2089^2^Johnsen,KH^Major,JE^1998^1^Black spruce family growth performance under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2^360^15^3^271-281^^^^^May^^^^^694010^2529^3153^361^374^384^546^705^prisingly insensitive to shoot-root partitioning in the model, apparently because of the limited soil N supply, which weakened the expected positive relationship between root growth and total N uptaA^6939^Seedlings from 20 families of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)

After one and two growth cycles, seedling height and diameter growth significantly increased under elevated CO2. At the end of the experiment, seedlings grown under high CO2 had a mean above-ground dry weight of 48.77 g as compared to 26.36 g for seedlings grown under ambient atmospheric CO2. Families were a significant source of variation for all growth parameters. Although the family x CO2 environment interaction was not a statistically significant source of variation in the analysis of variance, the correlation between greenhouse and IS-year field height growth was weaker (r = 0.29, p = 0.2177) under elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2 (r = 0.51, p = 0.0223) following the first growth cycle.

Concentrations of foliar starch and secondary compounds are reported in this paper. Starch concentrations remained unaffected by elevated CO2 and/or O-3 concentrations during the first 2 study years. But in the autumn of the last study year, a significantly higher concentration of starch was found in current-year needles of trees exposed to elevated CO2 compared with ambient air. There were large differences in concentrations of starch and secondary compounds between individual trees. Elevated concentrations of CO2 and/or O-3 did not have any significant effects on the concentrations of foliar total monoterpenes, total resin acids or total phenolics. Significantly higher concentrations of monoterpenes and resin acids and mostly lower concentrations of starch were found in trees growing without chambers than in those growing in open-top chambers, while there were no differences in concentrations of total phenolics between trees growing without or in chambers. The results suggest that elevated concentrations of CO2 might increase foliar starch concentrations in Scots pine, while secondary metabolites remain unaffected. Realistically elevated O-3 concentrations do not have clear effects on carbon allocation to starch and secondary compounds even after 3 exposure years.2091^1^Kerstiens,G^1998^1^Shade-tolerance as a predictor of responses to elevated CO2 in trees^37^102^3^472-480^^^^^Mar^^^^^69442163^2489^2640^2715^3154^3155^341^344^512^587^nd secondary compounds between individual trees.

These mutualisms regulate nutrient exchange in the plant-soil interface and might influence the way in which plants respond to increasing atmospheric CO2. In other experiments, mycorrhizal responses to elevated CO2 have been variable, so in this study we test the hypothesis that different genera of AM fungi differ in their response, and in turn alter the plant's response, to elevated CO2. Four species from three genera of AM fungi were tested. Artemisia tridentata Nutt. seedlings were inoculated with either Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, Glomus etunicatum Becker & Gerdemann, Acaulospora sp. or Scutellospora calospora (Nicol. & Gerd.) Walker & Sanders and grown at either ambient CO2 (350 ppm) or elevated CO2 (700 ppm). Several significant inter-specific responses were detected. Elevated CO2 caused percent arbuscular and hyphal colonization to increase for the two Glomus species, but not for Acaulospora sp. or S. calospora. Vesicular colonization was not affected by elevated CO2 for any fungal species. In the extra-radical phase, the two Glomus species produced a significantly higher number of spores in response to elevated CO2, whereas Acaulospora sp. and S. calospora developed significantly higher hyphal lengths. These data show that AM fungal taxa differ in their growth allocation strategies and in their responses to elevated CO2, and that mycorrhizal diversity should not be overlooked in global change research.2093^4^Ledergerber,S^Leadley,PW^Stocklin,J^Baur,B^1998^1^Feeding behaviour of juvenile snails (Helix pomatia) to four plant species grown at elevated atmospheric CO2^318^19^1^89-95^^^^^Jan-Feb^^^^^69481142^1997^338^374^874^) Walker & Sanders and grown at either ambient CO2 (350 ppm) or elevated CO2 (700 ppm).

The plant communities were grown either at ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (600 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Leaves of T. repens and P. vulgaris grown in elevated atmospheric CO2 had a lower specific leaf area, and leaves of T. repens had lower percentage N on a dry weight basis than leaves grown under ambient CO2 concentration. Snails fed on all four plant species, but showed a overwhelming preference for T. repens (percentages of total biomass consumed were 91.9 % at 350 ppm and 97.6 % at 600 ppm). The species-specific feeding intensity of juvenile H. pomatia did not differ between the two treatments. The total dry weight of T. repens consumed by the snails was marginally greater (P = 0.06) at elevated CO2, but there were no significant differences in leaf N or leaf area eaten. These findings are similar to numerous other studies showing that invertebrates increase their consumption of plant material to balance reductions in plant N concentrations at elevated CO2 treatments. Helix pomatia that fed on plants grown at elevated CO2 atmosphere showed a larger increase in relative wet weight than those that fed on plants from ambient CO2 conditions. However, the weight gain of H. pomatia was poorly correlated with amount of plant tissue consumed, so we suggest that the effect of CO2 on weight gain in H. pomatia was due to a change in the quality of T. repens leaves.

Although the ecology of this region has been extensively studied, there is little information on how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect it. This growth chamber study investigated gas exchange, water relations, growth, and biomass and carbohydrate partitioning in B. gracilis and P. gracilis grown under present ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations of 350 mu l l(-1) and 700 mu l l(-1), respectively, and two deficit irrigation regimes. The experiment was conducted in soil-packed columns planted to either species over a 2-month period under summer- like conditions and with no fertilizer additions. Our objective was to better under stand how these species and the functional groups they represent will respond in future CO2-enriched environments. Leaf CO2 assimilation (A(n)), transpiration use efficiency (TUE, or A(n)/transpiration), plant growth, and whole-plant water use efficiency (WUE, or plant biomass production/water evapotranspired) of both species were greater at elevated CO2, although responses were more pronounced for P. smithii. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis, TUE, and growth in both species through higher soil water content (SWC) and leaf water potentials (Psi) and stimulation of photosynthesis. Consumptive water use was greater and TUE less for P. smithii than B. gracilis during early growth when soil water was more available. Declining SWC with time was associated with a steadily increased sequestering of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNCs), storage carbohydrates (primarily fructans for P. Smithii) and biomass in belowground organs of P. smithii, but not B. gracilis. The root:shoot ratio of P. smithii also increased at elevated CO2 while the root:shoot ratio of B. gracilis was unresponsive to CO2. These partitioning responses may be the consequence of different ontogenetic strategies of a cool-season and warm-season grass entering a warm, dry summer period; the cool-season P. smithii responds by sequestering TNCs belowground in preparation for summer dormancy, while resource partitioning of the warm-season B. gracilis remains unaltered. One consequence of greater partitioning of resources into P. smithii belowground organs in the present study was maintenance of higher Psi and A(n) rates. This, along with differences in photosynthetic pathway, may have accounted for the greater responsiveness of P. smithii to CO2 enrichment compared to B. gracilis.2095^1^Niklaus,PA^1998^1^Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil microbiota in calcareous grassland^127^4^4^451-458^^^^^Apr^^^^^69521239^1781^312^374^467^547^57^661^738^99^und organs of P. smithii, but not B. gracilis.

Soil basal respiration was significantly increased on one out of 7 sampling dates (+ 14%, P = 0.03; December of the third year of treatment), whereas the metabolic quotient for CO2 (qCO(2) = basal respiration/microbial C) did not exhibit any significant differences between CO2 treatments. Also no responses of microbial activity and biomass were found in a complementary greenhouse study where intact grassland turfs taken from the field site were factorially treated with elevated CO2 and phosphorus (P) fertilizer (1 g P m(-2) y(-1)). Previously reported C balance calculations showed that in the ecosystem investigated growing season soil C inputs were strongly enhanced under elevated CO2. It is hypothesized that the absence of microbial responses to these enhanced soil C fluxes originated from mineral nutrient limitations of microbial processes. Laboratory incubations showed that short- term microbial growth (one week) was strongly limited by N availability, whereas P was not limiting in this soil. The absence of large effects of elevated CO2 on microbial activity or biomass in such nutrient-poor natural ecosystems is in marked contrast to previously published large and short-term microbial responses to CO2 enrichment which were found in fertilized or disturbed systems.

Apple plants (cv, Gala), 1-year-old, were exposed to [CO2] of 200, 360, 700, 1000, and 1600 mu L L-1 up to 8 d. Whole-plant net photosynthetic rates were analysed daily after [CO2] treatments. Newly expanded mature leaves were sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 8 d after [CO2] treatments for sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch analysis. Midday whole-plant net photosynthetic rates increased linearly with increasing [CO2], but the differences in whole-plant photosynthesis between CO2-enrichment and ambient [CO2] treatments were less significant as apple plants acclimated to high atmospheric [CO2] for 8 d. Increases in [CO2] significantly increased sorbitol and starch, but did not affect sucrose concentrations. As a result, the ratios of starch to sorbitol and starch to sucrose at 8 d after [CO2] treatments were increased from 0.05 and 0.06 to 0.8 and 1.6 as [CO2] increased from ambient [CO2] (360 mu L L-1) to 1000 mu L L-1 [CO2], respectively. The sorbitol to sucrose ratio also increased from 1.3 to 2.2 as [CO2] increased from 360 to 1000 mu L L-1.

Increases in [CO2] siA^6957^Although there is a great deal of information concerning responses to increases in atmospheric CO2 at the tissue and plant levels, there are substantially fewer studies that have investigated ecosystem-level responses in the context of integrated carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. Because our understanding of ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 is incomplete, modeling is a tool that can be used to investigate the role of plant and soil interactions in the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated CO2. In this study, we analyze the responses of net primary production (NPP) to doubled CO2 from 355 to 710 ppmv among three biogeochemistry models in the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP): BIOME-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles), Century, and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). For the conterminous United States, doubled atmospheric CO2 causes NPP to increase by 5% in Century, 8% in TEM, and 11% in BIOME-BGC. Multiple regression analyses between the NPP response to doubled CO2 and the mean annual temperature aid annual precipitation of biomes or grid cells indicate that there are negative relationships between precipitation and the response of NPP to doubled CO2 for all three models. In contrast, there are different relationships between temperature and the response of NPP to doubled CO2 for the three models: there is a negative relationship in the responses of BIOME-BGC, no relationship in the responses of Century, and a positive relationship in the responses of TEM. In BIOME-BGC, the NPP response to doubled CO2 is controlled by the change in transpiration associated with reduced leaf conductance to water vapor. This change affects soil water, then leaf area development and, finally, NPP. In Century, the response of NPP to doubled CO2 is controlled by changes in decomposition rates associated with increased soil moisture that results from reduced evapotranspiration. This change affects nitrogen availability for plants, which influences NPP. In TEM, the NPP response to doubled CO2 is controlled by increased carboxylation which is modified by canopy conductance and the degree to which nitrogen constraints cause down-regulation of photosynthesis. The implementation of these different mechanisms has consequences for the spatial pattern of NPP responses, and represents, in part, conceptual uncertainly about controls over NPP responses. Progress in reducing these uncertainties requires research focused at the ecosystem level to understand how interactions between the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles influence the response of NPP to elevated atmospheric CO2.2099^2^Reid,CD^Fiscus,EL^1998^1^Effects of elevated [CO2] and/or ozone on limitations to CO2 assimilation in soybean (Glycine max)^78^49^322^885-895^^^^^May^^^^^69601364^256^312^3161^344^384^435^444^448^728^es in decomposition rates associated with increased soil moisture that results from reduced evapotranspiration.

Through plant ontogeny, assimilation versus intercellular CO2 concentration (A/Ci) responses were measured to assess the limitations to assimilation imposed by the capacity for Rubisco carboxylation, RuBP regeneration, and stomatal diffusion. In the vegetative stages, no significant treatment effects of elevated [CO2] and/or [O-3] were observed on Rubisco carboxylation efficiency (CE), light and CO2-saturated assimilation capacity (A(max)), and chlorophyll content (Chl). However, for plants grown in elevated [CO2], the assimilation rate at growth [CO2] (A) was 60% higher than at ambient [CO2] up to the seed maturation stage, and the potential rate of assimilation by Rubisco capacity (A(p)) was increased. Also in elevated [CO2]: A was 51% of A(p); the relative stomatal limitation (%Stomata) was 5%; and the relative RuBP regeneration limitation (%RuBP) was 44%. In ambient [CO2], O-3 gradually decreased A per unit leaf area, but had little effect on A, and the relative limitations to assimilation where A remained 51% of A(p), %Stomata was 27%, and %RuBP was 22%.

This yield was increased by 38% and 75% at CO2 concentrations of 350 mu L L-1 and 900 mu L L-1 respectively.

Increasing the CO2 concentration reduced grain protein concentration of cv. Hartog from 17.4% at 280 mu L CO2 L-1 to 16.5% and 16% at CO2 concentrations of 350 mu L L-1 and 900 mu L L-1 respectively. The grain protein concentration of cv. Rosella was reduced from 10.7% to 10.2% by increasing the CO2 concentration from 280 mu L L-1 to 350 mu L L-1; however, an additional increase in the CO2 concentration to 900 mu L L-1 had no effect on grain protein concentration. In Hartog flour, the highest proportion of polymeric protein in the flour (7.7%) occurred at 280 mu L CO2 L-1. This was reduced to 6.3% at 350 mu L CO2 L-1 but then increased again to 7.0% at 900 mu L CO2 L-1. These changes in concentration of polymeric protein were correlated (r(2)=0.58) with changes in mixing properties, The mixing time required to produce optimum dough strength was greatest at 900 mu L CO2 L-1 (181 s), then 141 s and 151 s at 350 mu L CO2 L-1 and 280 mu L CO2 L-1 respectively. These changes in mixing time could not be explained by changes in grain protein concentration.

Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees were grown in open-top chambers under ambient or elevated concentrations of CO2. During the second year of growth, half of the trees were exposed to free-feeding forest tent caterpillars, while the remaining trees served as nondefoliated controls. Foliage was collected weekly for phytochemical analysis. Insect performance was evaluated on foliage from each of the treatments. At the sampling date coincident with insect bioassays, levels of foliar nitrogen and starch were lower and higher, respectively, in high CO2 foliage, and this trend persisted throughout the study. CO2-mediated increases in secondary compounds were observed for condensed tannins in aspen and gallotannins in maple. Defoliation reduced levels of water and nitrogen in aspen but had no effect on primary metabolites in maple. Similarly, defoliation induced accumulations of secondary compounds in aspen but not in maple. Larvae fed foliage from the enriched CO2 or defoliated treatments exhibited reduced growth and food processing efficiencies, relative to larvae on ambient CO2 or nondefoliated diets, but the patterns were host species-specific. Overall, CO2 and defoliation appeared to exert independent effects on foliar chemistry and forest tent caterpillar performance.2102^2^Schier,GA^McQuattie,CJ^1998^1^Effects of carbon dioxide enrichment on response of mycorrhizal pitch pine (Pinus rigida) to aluminum: growth and mineral nutrition^252^12^6^340-346^^^^^May^^^^^69661096^1967^1983^224^3164^372^419^456^680^791^r and higher, respectively, in high CO2 foliage, and this trend persisted throughout the study.

SimilA^6965^Carbon dioxide enrichment may increase the Al tolerance of trees by increasing root growth, root exudation and/or mycorrhizal colonization. The effect of elevated CO2 on the response of mycorrhizal pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) seedlings to Al was determined in two experiments with different levels of nutrients, 0.1- or 0.2-strength Clark solution. During each experiment, seedlings inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker & Couch were grown 13 weeks in sand irrigated with nutrient solution (pH 3.8) containing 0, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/l Al (0, 232, 463, or 927 mu M Al) in growth chambers fumigated with 350 (ambient) or 700 (elevated) mu l/l CO2. At ambient CO2 in the absence of Al, mean total dry weights (DW) of seedlings at the high nutrient level were 164% higher than those at the low level. Total DW at elevated CO2, in the absence of Al, was significantly greater than that in ambient CO2 at the low (+34%) and high (+16%) nutrient levels. Root and shoot DW at both nutrient levels decreased with increasing Al concentrations with Al reducing root growth more than shoot growth. Although visible symptoms of Al toxicity in roots and needles were reduced by CO2 enrichment, there were no significant CO2 x Al interactions for shoot or root DW. The percentage of seedling roots that became mycorrhizal was negatively related to nutrient level and was greater at elevated than at ambient CO2 levels. Generally, elevated CO2 had little effect on concentration of mineral nutrients in roots and needles. Aluminum reduced concentrations of most nutrients by inhibiting uptake.2103^4^Sehmer,L^Fontaine,V^Antoni,F^Dizengremel,P^1998^1^Effects of ozone and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on carbohydrate metabolism of spruce needles.

The results obtained showed an increase in the activities of three enzymes involved in the detoxification pathway, superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (AscPOD, EC 1.11.1.11) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) when trees were exposed to ozone and to ozone- carbon dioxide treatments. In these two treatments, the fraction of SOD activity due to the chloroplastic isoform was increased (1.5-fold). In the needles of trees exposed to ozone and to ozone-carbon dioxide fumigation, an increase in the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH, EC 1.1.1.49) showed that the cell had the capacity to produce more NADPH necessary for the detoxification. Stimulation of other enzymes of catabolic pathways (fumarase [EC 4.2.1.2], phosphofructokinase [PFK, EC 7.1.1] and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31]), was also observed making it possible for the cell to provide the reducing power necessary for detoxification as well as energy and carbon skeletons involved in the repair processes. When carbon dioxide alone was applied, no effects could be detected on these enzyme activities. However, when carbon dioxide was combined with ozone, the effect of ozone on trees was less than that induced by ozone alone, suggesting that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may to some extent protect plants from ozone injury.2104^3^Seneweera,SP^Ghannoum,O^Conroy,J^1998^1^High vapour pressure deficit and low soil water availability enhance shoot growth responses of a C-4 grass (Panicum coloratum cv.

Plants were grown for 35 days at CO2 concentrations of 350 or 1000 mu L CO2 L-1. Shoot water relations were altered by growing plants in soil which was brought daily to 65, 80 or 100% field capacity (FC) and by maintaining the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) at 0.9 or 2.1 kPa. At 350 mu L CO2 L-1, high VPD and lower soil water content depressed shoot dry mass, which declined in parallel at each VPD with decreasing soil water content. The growth depression at high VPD was associated with increased shoot transpiration, whereas at low soil water, leaf water potential was reduced. Elevated CO2 ameliorated the impact of both stresses by decreasing transpiration rates and raising leaf water potential. Consequently, high CO2 approximately doubled shoot mass and leaf length at a VPD of 2.1 kPa and soil water contents of 65 and 80% FC but had no effect on unstressed plants. Water use efficiency was enhanced by elevated CO2 under conditions of stress but this was primarily due to increases in shoot mass. High CO2 had a greater effect on leaf growth parameters than on stem mass. Elevated CO2 increased specific leaf area and leaf area ratio, the latter at high VPD only. We conclude that high CO2 increases shoot growth of C-4 grasses by ameliorating the effects of stress induced by either high VPD or low soil moisture. Since these factors limit growth of field-grown C-4 grasses, it is likely that their biomass will be enhanced by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.2105^3^Sims,DA^Seemann,JR^Luo,Y^1998^1^The significance of differences in the mechanisms of photosynthetic acclimation to light, nitrogen and CO2 for return on investment in leaves^43^12^2^185-194^^^^^Apr^^^^^69721914^3165^3166^3167^372^376^526^665^699^92^y, high CO2 approximately doubled shoot mass and leaf length at a VPD of 2.1 kPa and soil water contents of 65 and 80% FC bA^6971^1. We report changes in photosynthetic capacity of leaves developed in varying photon flux density (PFD), nitrogen supply and CO2 concentration. We determined the relative effect of these environmental factors on photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf volume as well as the volume of tissue per unit leaf area. We calculated resource-use efficiencies from the photosynthetic capacities and measurements of leaf dry mass, carbohydrates and nitrogen content. 2. There were clear differences between the mechanisms of photosynthetic acclimation to PFD, nitrogen supply and CO2. PFD primarily affected volume of tissue per unit area whereas nitrogen supply primarily affected photosynthetic capacity per unit volume. CO2 concentration affected both of these parameters and interacted strongly with the PFD and nitrogen treatments. 3. Photosynthetic capacity per unit carbon invested in leaves increased in the low PFD, high nitrogen and low CO2 treatments. Photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen was significantly affected only by nitrogen supply. 4. The responses to low PFD and low nitrogen appear to function to increase the efficiency of utilization of the limiting resource. However, the responses to elevated CO2 in the high PFD and high nitrogen treatments suggest that high CO2 can result in a situation where growth is not limited by either carbon or nitrogen supply. Limitation of growth at elevated CO2 appears to result from internal plant factors that limit utilization of carbohydrates at sinks and/or transport of carbohydrates to sinks.2106^4^Torbert,HA^Prior,SA^Rogers,HH^Runion,GB^1998^1^Crop residue decomposition as affected by growth under elevated atmospheric CO2^115^163^5^412-419^^^^^May^^^^^69742087^312^376^408^57^centration affected both of these parameters and interacted strongly with the PFD and nitrogen treatments. 3.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration has been Shown to increase plant biomass, resulting in greater amounts of residue returned to soil. However, the effects on long-term storage of C in soil are highly debated. Changes in both quantity and quality of plant residue, as well as residue management, may alter soil C and N dynamics that will, in turn, affect the ability of soil to store C. Plant residues were collected from an experiment using open top chambers to increase CO2 levels under field conditions. A soil incubation study was conducted with a Blanton loamy sand (loamy siliceous, thermic, Grossarenic Paleudults) to examine the effect of residue additions to two crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. and grain sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), grown at two CO2 concentrations (ambient and twice ambient), and two incorporation treatments (incorporated or surface placement) on potential C and N mineralization. The difference in biomass inputs between plants grown in ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 was also considered. Simulated residue incorporation reduced inorganic N concentration but had no effect on C mineralization. Both inorganic N content and C mineralization were higher with soybean than with grain sorghum. Although changes to both plant residue quality and quantity caused by elevated CO2 concentration affected C cycling in soil, residue quality may be more important for determining C storage. Nitrogen cycling in soil may be a controlling factor for C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.2107^3^Warwick,KR^Taylor,G^Blum,H^1998^1^Biomass and compositional changes occur in chalk grassland turves exposed to elevated CO2 for two seasons in FACE^127^4^4^375-385^^^^^Apr^^^^^69762070^230^312^3168^344^374^376^384^673^977^m bicolor (L.)

The turves were clipped regularly to a height of 5 cm and assessed for above ground biomass production and relative abundance based on accumulated clipped dry biomass as well as by point quadrat recording. Below ground biomass production was assessed with root in- growth bags during the second season of growth. Increases in total biomass (> 30%) were noted in elevated CO2, but the differences did not become significant until the second season of growth. Individual species' biomass varied in response to elevated CO2, with significant increases in biomass in elevated CO2 turves for both legume species, and no significant CO2 effect on S. minor or P. media. An initial positive CO2 effect on biomass of combined grass species was reversed by the end of the experiment with less biomass and a significantly smaller proportion of total biomass present in elevated CO2, which was attributed primarily to changes in proportion of F. ovina. Species relative abundance was significantly affected by elevated CO2 in the final 4 of the 6 clip events, with the legume species increasing in proportion at the expense of the other species, particularly the grasses. Root length and dry weight were both significantly increased in elevated CO2 (77% and 89%, respectively), and these increases were greater than increases in shoot biomass (36%) from the same period. Species responses to elevated CO2, within the model community, were not consistent with predictions made from data on individual species, leading to the conclusion that responses to elevated CO2, at the community level, and species within the community level, are the result of direct physiological effects and indirect competitive effects. These conclusions are discussed with respect to the ecological responses of natural communities, and the chalk grassland community in particular, to elevated CO2.2108^3^Wayne,PM^Reekie,EG^Bazzaz,FA^1998^1^Elevated CO2 ameliorates birch response to high temperature and frost stress: implications for modeling climate-induced geographic range shifts^2^114^3^335-342^^^^^Apr^^^^^69782017^230^310^312^344^361^402^605^669^867^ expense of the other species, particularly the grasses.

Using yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) as a model species, we studied how elevated CO2 (800 vs. 400 mu l l(-1)) influences seedling growth and physiological responses to a 5 degrees C increase in summer air temperatures (31/26 vs. 26/21 degrees C day/night), and how both elevated CO2 and air temperature during the growing season influence seedling ability to survive freezing stress during the winter dormant season. Our results show that while increased temperature decreases seedling growth, temperature-induced growth reductions are significantly lower at elevated CO2 concentrations (43% vs. 73%). The amelioration of high- temperature stress was related to CO2-induced reductions in both whole-shoot dark respiration and transpiration. Our results also show that increased summer air temperature, and to a lesser degree CO2 concentration, make dormant winter buds less susceptible to freezing stress. We show the relevance of these results to models used to predict how climate change will influence future forest species distribution and productivity, without considering the direct or interactive effects of CO2.2109^3^Barrett,DJ^Richardson,AE^Gifford,RM^1998^1^Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase wheat root phosphatase activity when growth is limited by phosphorus^92^25^1^87-93^^^^^^^^^^6980243^312^3169^3170^360^376^407^438^738^867^e seedling ability to survive freezing stress during the winter dormant season.

Acid phosphomonoesterase ('phosphatase') activity of root segments was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. When plant growth was P-limited, elevated CO2 concentrations increased phosphatase activity more than at ambient CO2. This result (1) was evident when expressed on a unit root dry weight or root length basis, indicating that increased root enzyme activity was unlikely to be associated with CO2-induced changes in root morphology; (2) occurred when plants were grown aseptically, indicating that the increase in phosphatase activity originated from root cells rather than root-associated microorganisms; (3) was associated with shoot P concentrations below 0.18%; (4) occurred only when wheat roots were grown under P deficiency but not when a transient P deficiency was imposed; and (5) suggest that a previously reported increase in phosphatase activity at elevated CO2 by an Australian native pasture grass (Gifford, Lutze and Barrett 1996; Plant and Soil 187, 369-387) was also a root mediated response. The observed increase in phosphatase activity by plant roots at elevated CO2, if confirmed for a wide range of field pasture and crop species, is one factor which may increase mineralisation of soil organic P as the anthropogenic increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations continues. But, whether a concomitant increase in plant uptake of P occurs will depend on the relative influence of root and microbial phosphatases, and soil geochemistry in determining the rate of mineralisation of soil organic P for any given soil.2110^3^Bartak,M^Nijs,I^Impens,I^1998^1^The susceptibility of PS II of Lolium perenne to a sudden fall in air temperature - response of plants grown in elevated CO2 and/or increased air temperature^173^39^1^85-95^^^^^Feb^^^^^69821092^1240^243^312^3171^3172^348^493^633^713^(5) suggest that a previously repA^6981^The effect of a sudden fall in air temperature from 20 to 5 degrees C on fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence, maximum yield of the photosystem II photochemical reactions (Fv/Fm), quantum yield of the photosystem II electron transport (Phi(II)) coefficients of photochemical (qP), non-photochemical quenching (qN) was studied in Lolium perenne using a modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique.

The nitrogen cost of photosynthetic components to carry out each process is calculated for the optimal partitioning of nitrogen among the components. The model predicts that nitrogen allocation to the components carrying out RuBP regeneration should be increased with reduction in allocation to RuBPCase to maximize daily photosynthesis at 70 Pa CO2. Al a temperature of 25 degrees C, doubling the current CO2 level increases daily photosynthesis by 60% with optimal reallocation of the nitrogen partitioning while the increase without reallocation of nitrogen is 40%. However, at lower growth irradiance, the advantage in daily photosynthesis due to the reallocation decreases with increasing nitrogen content. The ratio of photosynthesis at 70 Pa to that at 35 Pa increases with increasing temperature. The effects of CO2 levels on photosynthesis of a canopy in which nitrogen is optimally allocated among leaf layers are also examined. At 25 degrees C, canopy photosynthesis at the doubled CO2 level is predicted to increase 60 and 40% with and without the optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components, respectively. Doubling the CO2 level does not affect the optimal nitrogen distribution among leaf layers in the canopy irrespective of optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components.

(Poaceae), an exotic Mojave Desert annual grass, grown in ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 to determine if parental CO2 growth conditions affected seed quality. Performance of seeds developed on the above plants was evaluated to determine the influence of parental CO2 growth conditions on germination, growth rate, and leaf production, Seeds of B. rubens developed oil parents grown in elevated CO2 had a larger pericarp surface area, higher C:N ratio, and less total mass than ambient-developed seeds, Parental CO2 environment did not have an effect on germination percentage or mean germination timer as determined by radicle emergence.

Elevated-CO2-developed seeds had smaller seed reset-yes than ambient seeds, as determined by growing seedlings in sterile media and monitoring senescence. It appears that increased seed C:N ratios associated with plants grown under elevated CO2 may have a major effect on seed quality (morphology, nutrition) and seedling performance (e.g., growth rate and leaf production). Since the invasive success of B. rubens is primarily due to its ability to rapidly germinate, increase leaf area and maintain a relatively high growth rate compared to native annuals and perennial grasses, reductions in seed duality and seedling performance in elevated CO2 may have significant impacts on future community composition in the Mojave Desert.2118^7^Johnson,DW^Thomas,RB^Griffin,KL^Tissue,DT^Ball,JT^Strain,BR^Walker,RF^1998^1^Effects of carbon dioxide and nitrogen on growth and nitrogen uptake in ponderosa and loblolly pine^204^27^2^414-425^^^^^Mar-Apr^^^^^69981044^1747^1967^2087^3003^372^374^456^669^672^e same growth period.

Growth response to elevated CO2 ranged from zero to more than 1000%, depending largely upon N status, In both species, growth response to CO2 was greater under moderate N deficiency than under extreme N deficiency or N sufficiency/excess. Elevated CO2 generally caused lowered tissue N concentrations in many (but not all) cases, which in turn resulted in smaller increases in N uptake than in biomass. Growth response to N ranged from -50 (in ponderosa pine) to more than 1000%, depending upon the N status of the control medium. Growth response to N was enhanced by elevated CO2 when N was in the extreme deficiency range but not when N was in the moderate deficiency range. In two separate studies, ponderosa pine responded negatively to high N inputs, and in each case this response was mitigated by elevated CO2. Collectively, these results show that (i) N deficiency is a continuum rather than a step function, (ii) responses to elevated CO2 vary across this continuum of N deficiency, and (iii) elevated CO2 greatly enhances growth response to N additions when N is initially in the extremely deficient range.2119^15^Jones,TH^Thompson,LJ^Lawton,JH^Bezemer,TM^Bardgett,RD^Blackburn,TM^Bruce,KD^Cannon,PF^Hall,GS^Hartley,SE^Howson,G^Jones,CG^Kampichler,C^Kandeler,E^Ritchie,DA^1998^1^Impacts of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide on model terrestrial ecosystems^32^280^5362^441-443^^^^^17 Apr^^^^^70001262^1327^1334^1850^1983^3176^372^407^56^778^from -50 (in ponderosa pine) to more than 1000%, depending upon the N status of the control medium.

We determined microbial biomass and activity in the soil of multitrophic model ecosystems housed in the Ecotron (NERC Centre for Population Biology, Ascot, UK) under two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient vs. ambient + 200 ppm). The model communities consist of four annual plant species which naturally co-occur in weedy fields and disturbed ground throughout southern England, together with their herbivores, parasitoids and soil biota. At the end of two experimental runs lasting 9 and 4.5 months, respectively, root dry weight and quality showed contradictory responses to elevated CO2 concentrations, probably as a consequence of the different time-periods (and hence number of plant generations) in the two experiments. Despite significant root responses no differences in microbial biomass could be detected. Effects of CO2 concentration on microbial activity were also negligible. Specific enzymes (protease and xylanase) showed a significant decrease in activity in one of the experimental runs. This could be related to the higher C:N ratio of root tissue. We compare the results with data from the literature and conclude that the response of complex communities cannot be predicted on the basis of oversimplified experimental set-ups.2121^2^LeCain,DR^Morgan,JA^1998^1^Growth, gas exchange, leaf nitrogen and carbohydrate concentrations in NAD-ME and NADP-ME C-4 grasses grown in elevated CO2^37^102^2^297-306^^^^^Feb^^^^^7004130^243^312^3178^3179^344^360^374^376^417^erimental runs lasting 9 and 4.5 months, respectively, root dry weight and quality showed contradictory responses to elevated CO2 concentrations, probably as a consequence of the different time-periods (and hence number of plant generations) in the two experiments.

Within the grass family (Poaceae) bundle sheath leakiness to CO2 is purported to be lowest in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40) group, highest in the NAD-ME (EC 1.1.1.39) group and intermediate in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK, EC 4.1.1.32) group. We investigated the hypothesis that growth and photosynthesis of NAD-ME C-4 grasses would respond more to elevated CO2 treatment than NADP-ME grasses. Plants were frown in 8-1 pots in growth chambers with ample water and fertilizer for 39 days at a continuous CO2 concentration of either 350 or 700 mu l 1(-1). NAD-ME species included Bouteloua gracilis Lag. ex Steud (Blue grama), Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm. (Buffalo grass) and Panicum virgatum L. (Switchgrass) and the NADP-ME species were Andropogon gerardii Vittman (Big bluestem), Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash (Little bluestem), and Sorghastrum mutans (L.) Nash (Indian grass). Contrary to our hypothesis, growth of the NADP-ME grasses was generally greater under elevated CO2 (significant for A. gerardii and S. mutans), while none of the NAD-ME grasses had a significant growth response. Increased leaf total non- structural carbohydrate (TNC) was associated with greater growth responses of NADP-ME grasses. Decreased leaf nitrogen in NADP-ME species grown at elevated CO2 was found to be an artifact of TNC dilution. Assimilation (A) vs intercellular CO2 (C-i) curves revealed that leaf photosynthesis was not saturated at 350 mu l 1(-1) CO2, in any of these C-4 grasses. Assimilation of elevated CO2-grown A. gerardii was higher than in plants grown in ambient CO2. In contrast, B. gracilis grown in elevated CO2 displayed lower A, a trait more commonly reported in C-3 plants. Photosynthetic acclimation is B. gracilis was not related to leaf TNC or nitrogen concentrations, but A:C-i curves suggest a reduction in activity of both phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39). Some adaptation of stomatal functioning was also seen in B. gracilis and A. gerardii leaves grown in elevated CO2. Our study shows that C-4 grasses have the capacity for increased growth and photosynthesis under elevated CO2 even when water and nutrients are non-limiting.

The difficulty in understanding differences in stomatal conductance between plants grown for any length of time in different CO2 atmospheres is stressed because of the many other possible changes in the plants' carbohydrate, nutrient and water relations. The other key issues that are highlighted are: whether stomata acclimate to CO2 either in parallel with any mesophyll photosynthetic acclimation or independently of changes in the mesophyll; whether stomata on different leaf surfaces respond to CO2 similarly; and whether reported changes in stomatal frequency are important to leaf gas exchange.

Five growth chambers were maintained at ambient (350 mu l l(-1)) CO2 and another five at twice ambient (700 mu l l(-1)) CO2 throughout the experiment.

The plants were irrigated with half- strength Hoagland's nutrient solution three times per day. Growth of plant parts was determined at the end of the experiment.

We found an increase in intensity of infection when plants were exposed to elevated CO2, and we found a decrease in infection intensity when plants were fertilized. This finding is significant in that it provides evidence for an increase in carbon allocation to the mycobiont under elevated CO2 even in the absence of change in percent infection, or mycorrhizal root length.

Karst.) trees, branches were enclosed in ventilated, transparent plastic bags and flushed with ambient air (mean 370 mu mol CO2 mol(-1); control) or ambient air + 340 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) (elevated CO2) during two growing seasons. One branch bag was installed on each of 24 selected trees From control and fertilized plots. To reduce the effect of variation among trees, results from each treated branch were compared with those from a control branch on the same whorl of the same tree. Elevated CO2 increased rates of light-saturated photosynthesis on average by 55% when measured at the treatment CO2 concentration. The increase was larger in shoots with high needle nitrogen concentrations than in shoots with low needle nitrogen concentrations. However, shoots grown in elevated CO2 showed a decrease in photosynthetic capacity compared with shoots grown in ambient CO2. When measured at the internal CO2 concentration of 200 mu mol CO2 mol(-1), photosynthetic rates of branches in the elevated CO2 treatments were reduced by 8 to 32%. The elevated CO2 treatment caused a 9 to 20% reduction in carboxylation efficiency and an 18% increase in respiration rates. In response to elevated CO2, starch, fructose and glucose concentrations in the needles increased on average 33%, whereas concentrations of potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium and boron decreased. Needle nitrogen concentrations explained 50-60% of the variation in photosynthesis and CO2 acclimation was greater at low nitrogen concentrations than at high nitrogen concentrations.

Although at high concentrations pollutants such as SO2 and O-3 usually cause stomatal closure, at low concentrations stomatal conductance is often increased. As well as creating a risk of loss of control of water relations, this is likely to increase the dose of the pollutant entering the mesophyll. It is, however, difficult to generalize about the nature of the physiological disturbances caused by pollutants because of variation in the responses between plants. In some cases the effects may be peculiar to one, or just a few, species. Two mechanisms underlying the interference with stomatal control have recently been identified, one involving O-3 and the other CO2. In Aster tripolium (sea aster) stomata in detached epidermal strips close as the external Na+ concentration is increased, and it has been proposed that this phenomenon is involved in the regulation of salt loading of shoot tissues. Ozone has been shown to have the capacity to interfere with Na+-induced stomatal closure, and the possibility that it therefore disrupts an aspect of salinity tolerance in this species is worthy of further research. Elevated CO2, on the other hand, has been found to interfere with the control of water relations of beech (Fagus sylvatica): for a given degree of drought, stomatal conductance and rates of soil water depletion were significantly higher in elevated CO2 than in ambient air.

However, the response of beech indicates that in some species there may also be detrimental effects of CO2-enrichment on plant-water relations.the external Na+ concentration is increA^7017^The rate and extent of leaf thickness and development are important determinants of plant photosynthetic capacity, The interactive effects of photon flux density (PFD), nitrogen supply and CO2 concentration on leaf expansion rate were measured as well as final leaf size and thickness of soybean, Leaf thickness and final area were not correlated with leaf relative expansion rate (RER) suggesting that these parameters are controlled by different mechanisms and that final leaf dimensions are determined by the duration rather than the rate of leaf expansion, Carbohydrate supply did not explain the variation ii? leaf RER since RER increased with increasing CO2 concentration, but decreased with increasing PFD. Leaf thickness and final area were related to resource supply but not in a simple fashion, Both positive and negative correlations between leaf thickness and carbohydrate and nitrogen concentrations were obtained depending on the environmental variable responsible for the variation. In contrast, there was a simple proportional relationship between whole plant relative growth rate and a correlate of leaf thickness (leaf water content per unit area), suggesting that leaf thickness responds to the balanced supply of all resources, in the same fashion as RGR, rather than to any individual resource.2129^2^Smith,PHD^Jones,TH^1998^1^Effects of elevated CO2 on the chrysanthemum leafminer, Chromatomyia syngenesiae: a greenhouse study^127^4^3^287-291^^^^^Mar^^^^^70201282^A^7019^Although feeding behaviour of Chromatomyia syngenesiae on plants grown in elevated CO2 (ambient + 200ppm) was unaffected, leaf-miner development was slower in elevated compared to ambient CO2 atmospheres.

The leaf basal segment was also studied separately and growth in an enriched CO2 atmosphere was associated with a dramatic increase (over 6-fold) in diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) labelling, indicating an increased rate of mitochondrial membrane biogenesis, Immunocytological observations correlated with this metabolic result. Both leaf samples showed significant decreases in pigment and surface wax labelling caused by growth at elevated CO2. Growth at different CO2 concentrations also influenced fatty acid labelling patterns, particularly those of the major labelled membrane lipids of the primary leaf whereby there were changes in their ratios of radiolabelled 16 carbon to 18 carbon fatty acids. Phosphatidylglycerol was characterized, for instance, by increased palmitate labelling after wheat was grown in elevated CO2 concentrations, In contrast, phosphatidylcholine was marked by a dramatic decrease in palmitate labelling but a corresponding increase in labelling of its 18 carbon unsaturated fatty acids, The diacylglycerol fraction showed increased unsaturation of its C18 fatty acids. In addition, changes to the fatty acid moieties from the basal segment lipids were also associated with changes in the amount of labelling of the polyenoic fatty acids of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol.

For example, young expanding leaves in tree species may be less affected by enriched CO2-alterations in leaf phytochemistry than older mature leaves due to shorter exposure times to elevated CO2 atmospheres. This, in turn, could result in different effects on early vs. late instar larvae of herbivorous insects. To address this, seedlings of white oak (Quercus alba L.), grown in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated CO2, were fed to two important early spring feeding herbivores; gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.), and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner). Young, expanding leaves were presented to early instar larvae, and older fully expanded or mature leaves to late instar larvae. Young leaves had significantly lower leaf nitrogen content and significantly higher total nonstructural carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio as plant CO2 concentration rose, while nonstructural carbohydrates and total carbon-based phenolics were unaffected by plant CO2 treatment. These phytochemical changes contributed to a significant reduction in the growth rate of early instar gypsy moth larvae, while growth rates of forest tent caterpillar were unaffected. The differences in insect responses were attributed to an increase in the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of early instar forest tent caterpillar larvae feeding on elevated CO2-grown leaves, while early instar gypsy moth larval NUE remained unchanged among the treatments. Later instar larvae of both insect species experienced larger reductions in foliage quality on elevated CO2-grown leaves than earlier instars, as the carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves substantially increased. Despite this, neither insect species exhibited changes in growth or consumption rates between CO2 treatments in the later instar. An increase in NUE was apparently responsible for offsetting reduced foliar nitrogen for the late instar larvae of both species.2133^1^Woodward,A^1998^1^Relationships among environmental variables and distribution of tree species at high elevation in the Olympic mountains^61^72^1^10-22^^^^^Feb^^^^^702817^227^3188^3189^937^th larvae, while growth rates of forest tent caterpillar were unaffected.

A transect consisting of three plots was established down one north-and one south-facing slope in stands representing the typical elevational sequence of tree species. Tree species included subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), and Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). Air and soil temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture were measured during three growing seasons. Snowmelt patterns, soil carbon and moisture release curves were also determined. The plots represented a wide range in soil water potential, a major determinant of tree species distribution (range of minimum values = -1.1 to -8.0 MPa for Pacific silver fir and Douglas-fir plots, respectively). Precipitation intercepted at plots depended on topographic location, storm direction and storm type. Differences in soil moisture among plots was related to soil properties, while annual differences at each plot were most often related to early season precipitation. Changes in climate due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will likely shift tree species distributions within, but not among aspects.

The prevalent perception is that process-based models are suited only for research applications and that management questions will be solved only by using descriptive empirical models. This is despite the fact that the latter can neither deal satisfactorily with changing environmental and management conditions nor answer all questions currently asked by managers. This paper develops the proposition that the end-use specifies the design and scale of forest simulation models, and that given the range of questions now asked in forest management a range of models is required. The spatial and temporal resolution, and the input and output data required to address typical forest management questions is examined. A survey of recent literature examines in which areas, and by whom, existing forest productivity models are being applied. It is concluded that many current management questions can be adequately answered using models in which a phenomenological approach is applied to predict annual forest growth at the stand-scale. Lumped-parameter process-based models and hybrid models provide the most immediate means through which our understanding of the biological processes underlying forest growth can be included in forest management systems. However, more detailed process-based models can Flay an important role in validating simpler models, in the development of generalizations applicable over long time scales and for testing hypotheses about the way trees function and respond to interacting stresses. Guidelines are also given on model structures appropriate for different classes of management questions.

Testing the predictions of such models is essential to their development prior to use in a predictive capacity. The climate change experiment (CLIMEX) has exposed an entire catchment of boreal vegetation to elevated CO2 (560 ppmv) and temperature (+3 degrees C in summer, +5 degrees C in winter) for the past three years and has a considerable archive of pre-and posttreatment measurements of both CO2 and water vapour fluxes of the vegetation, catchment runoff and soil nutrient status. These data have been used to test the predictions of the University of Sheffield dynamic global vegetation model (SDGVM) for the same site using historical records of climate as input. Comparisons of observations and predictions at the scale of individual leaves and whole ecosystems are generally favourable, increasing our confidence in the application of the model to forecasting the responses of the terrestrial biosphere to various global change scenarios. The SDGVM has been used to predict the future responses of the ecosystem at the site into the year 2003AD. The results indicate rather small changes in leaf area index and catchment runoff but quite large increases in net primary productivity. The model predictions are now open to testing further as the CO2 and temperature treatments continue in the CLIMEX greenhouse.2138^2^Bunce,JA^Ziska,LH^1998^1^Decreased hydraulic conductance in plants at elevated carbon dioxide^9^21^1^121-126^^^^^Jan^^^^^70381030^1323^2866^3196^344^347^376^386^434^92^ent status.

Global climatic change may modify the net carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, causing feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 and climate. We describe a model for investigating terrestrial carbon exchange and its response to climatic variation based on the processes of plant photosynthesis, carbon allocation, litter production, and soil organic carbon decomposition. The model is used to produce geographical patterns of net primary production (NPP), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils, and the seasonal variations in net ecosystem production (NEP) under both contemporary and future climates. For contemporary climate, the estimated global NPP is 57.0 Gt C y(-1), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils are 640 Gt C and 1358 Gt C, respectively, and NEP varies from -0.5 Gt C in October to 1.6 Gt C in July. For a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration and the corresponding climate, we predict that global NPP will rise to 69.6 Gt C y(-1), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils will increase by, respectively, 133 Gt C and 160 Gt C, and the seasonal amplitude of NEP will increase by 76%. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 without climate change may enhance NPP by 25% and result in a substantial increase in carbon stocks in vegetation and soils. Climate change without CO2 elevation will reduce the global NPP and soil carbon stocks, but leads to an increase in vegetation carbon because of a forest extension and NPP enhancement in the north. By combining the effects of CO2 doubling, climate change, and the consequent redistribution of vegetation, we predict a strong enhancement in NPP and carbon stocks of terrestrial ecosystems. This study simulates the possible variation in the carbon exchange at equilibrium state. We anticipate to investigate the dynamic responses in the carbon exchange to atmospheric CO2 elevation and climate change in the past and future.2140^3^Case,AL^Curtis,PS^Snow,AA^1998^1^Heritable variation in stomatal responses to elevated CO2 in wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum (Brassicaceae)^5^85^2^253-258^^^^^Feb^^^^^70421142^1208^251^312^344^348^376^384^417^92^l increase by 76%.

To test for heritable effects of elevated CO2 on stomatal responses and plant fecundity in Raphanus raphanistrum, we grew plants from 12 paternal families in outdoor open-top chambers at ambient (35 Pa) or elevated (67 Pa) CO2. Contrary to results from a previous study of this species, total flower and fruit production were marginally lower under elevated CO2. Across families, stomatal index and guard cell length showed little response to CO2 enrichment, but these characters varied significantly among paternal families in both the direction and magnitude of their response to changing CO2. Although these family-by-CO2, interactions suggest that natural selection might affect stomatal characters when ambient CO2 levels increase, we found no significant correlation between either character and flower or fruit production. Therefore, our data suggest that while heritable variation for stomatal index and guard cell length exists in this population, selection due to increasing CO2 is not likely to act on these traits because they had no detectable effect on lifetime fecundity.2141^3^Crookshanks,M^Taylor,G^Broadmeadow,M^1998^1^Elevated CO2 and tree root growth: contrasting responses in Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris^84^138^2^241-250^^^^^Feb^^^^^7044130^2393^3055^310^376^377^407^508^547^867^production were marginally lower under elevated CO2.

L. and Pinus sylvestris L. grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) during a long-term exposure (20 months), during which root systems were allowed to develop without restriction imposed by pots. Root growth, measured as root length using root in-growth bags was increased significantly in trees exposed to elevated CO2, although the magnitude of the response differed considerably between species and with time of sampling, the greatest effect observed after 6 months in ash (ratio of elevated:ambient, e:a; 3.40) and the smallest effect observed in oak (e:a; 1.95). This was accompanied by changes in specific root length, with a significant decrease in all species after 6 months, suggesting that root diameter or root density were increased in elevated CO2. Increases in root length might have resulted from an acceleration in root cell expansion, since epidermal cell size was significantly increased in the zone of elongation in ash root tips (P < 0.05). Contrasting effects of elevated CO2 were observed for root carbohydrates, with significant increases in soluble sugars for all species (P < 0.05), but both increases and decreases in starch content were observed, depending on species, and producing a significant interaction between species and CO2 (P < 0.001). Exposure to elevated CO2 increased the total root d. wt for whole trees of all three species after 8 months of exposure, although the magnitude of this effect, in contrast to the root in-growth study, was greatest in Scots pine and smallest in ash. No significant effect of elevated CO2 was observed on the root:shoot ratio. Further detailed analysis of whole root systems after 20 months confirmed that species differences in root responses to elevated CO2 were apparent, with increased coarse and fine root production in elevated CO2 for Scots pine and ash respectively. Lateral root number was increased in elevated CO2 for all species, as was mean root diameter. Root respiration rates were significantly reduced in elevated CO2 for all three species. These results provide firm evidence that exposure of trees to future CO2 concentrations will have large effects on root system development, growth, carbohydrate status and respiration. The magnitude and direction of such effects will differ, depending on species. The consequences of such responses for the three species studied are discussed.2142^3^Gleadow,RM^Foley,WJ^Woodrow,IE^1998^1^Enhanced CO2 alters the relationship between photosynthesis and defence in cyanogenic Eucalyptus cladocalyx F.

Our hypothesis was that the expected increase in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency of plants grown at elevated CO2 concentrations would lead to an effective reallocation of available nitrogen from photosynthesis to prunasin, Seedlings were grown at two concentrations of CO2 and nitrogen, and the proportion of leaf nitrogen allocated to photosynthesis, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), protein and prunasin compared, Up to 20% of leaf nitrogen was allocated to the cyanogenic glycoside, although this proportion varied with leaf age, position and growth conditions, Leaf prunasin concentration,vas strongly affected by nitrogen supply, but did not increase, on a dry weight basis, in the leaves from the elevated CO2 treatments, However, the proportion of nitrogen allocated to prunasin increased significantly, in spite of a decreasing pool of leaf nitrogen, in the plants grown at elevated concentrations of CO2. There was less protein in leaves of plants grown at elevated CO2 in both nitrogen treatments, while the concentration of active sites of Rubisco only decreased in plants from the low-nitrogen treatment. These changes in leaf chemistry may have significant implications in terms of the palatability of foliage and defence against herbivores.2143^5^Griffiths,BS^Ritz,K^Ebblewhite,N^Paterson,E^Killham,K^1998^1^Ryegrass rhizosphere microbial community structure under elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, with observations on wheat rhizosphere^130^30^3^315-321^^^^^Mar^^^^^70481096^1781^2920^3198^374^376^407^504^797^92^ed with leaf age, position and growth conditions, Leaf prunasin concentration,vas strongly affected by nitrogen supply, but did not increase, on a dry weight basis, in the leaves from the elevated CO2 treatments, However, tA^7047^The structure of microbial communities in the rhizospheres of ryegrass and wheat, growing at an elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, was investigated using broad-scale DNA techniques.

DNA analysis of the rhizosphere of ryegrass grown in soil microcosms for 28 or 42 d, showed only minor differences between plants grown at 450 or 720 mu l CO2 l(-1). In a second experiment with ryegrass, 5 of 10 replicate microcosms were pulse labelled with (CO2)-C-14 and 5 simultaneously sampled for DNA analysis. Carbon partitioning below ground showed changes due to the elevated CO2, notably an increased proportion of fi?ted carbon in non-microbial biomass residue in the rhizosphere. There was again no effect of elevated CO2 on rhizosphere microbial community structure. Community DNA hybridisation indicated that the rhizosphere communities under ambient and elevated CO2 were 86% similar (unlikely to be a biologically relevant change), with indistinguishable %G + C profiles. Wheat was grown to maturity (129 d) in a different soil microcosm design, and rhizosphere microbial communities from plants grown at 350 and 700 mu l CO2 l(-1) were identical according to the DNA analyses.

Soil microcosms were planted with ryegrass and maintained under constant growth conditions at either ambient (450ppm) or elevated (720ppm) CO2 concentration. At harvest, the rhizosphere soil was collected and subjected to a potential denitrification assay to provide an estimate of the size of the denitrifier population present. Ryegrass dry matter production varied across the pH range studied and contrary to other studies, elevated CO2 concentration did not consistently increase growth. Plant growth was reduced by approximate to 35% and 23% at pH 4.3 and pH 5.9, respectively, under elevated CO2 concentration. At pH 7.0, however, plant growth was increased by approximate to 45% under elevated CO2. Potential denitrification rates within the rhizosphere followed a similar pattern to plant growth in the different treatments, suggesting that plant growth and the size of denitrifier population within the rhizosphere are coupled.

Measurements were made in plots of Lolium perenne maintained under high N input. During the data collection period N fertiliser was applied at a rate of 14 g m(-2) of N. Elevated pCO(2) appeared to result in an increased (27%) output of N2O, thought to be the consequence of enhanced root-derived available soil C, acting as an energy source for denitrification. The climate, agricultural practices and soils at the FACE experiment combined to give rise to some of the largest N2O emissions recorded for any terrestrial ecosystem. The amount of CO2-C being lost from the control plot was higher (10%) than for the enhanced CO2 plot, and is the reverse of that predicted. The control plot oxidised consistently more CH4 than the enhanced plot, oxidising 25.5 +/- 0.8 mu g m(-2) hr(- 1) of CH4 for the control plot, with an average of 8.5 +/- 0.4 mu g m(-2) hr(-1) of CH4 for the enhanced CO2 plot. This suggests that elevated pCO(2) may lead to a feedback whereby less CH4 is removed from the atmosphere. Despite the limited nature of the current study (in time and space), the observations made here on the interactions of elevated pCO(2) and soil trace gas release suggest that significant interactions are occurring. The feedbacks involved could have importance at the global scale.2146^4^Jackson,RB^Sala,OE^Paruelo,JM^Mooney,HA^1998^1^Ecosystem water fluxes for two grasslands in elevated CO2: a modeling analysis^2^113^4^537-546^^^^^Feb^^^^^7054243^374^377^385^529^547^57^674^783^92^ largest N2O emissions recorded for any terrestrial ecosystem.

Furthermore, predictions for a given biome need to take into account differences in productivity and leaf area index (LAI) independent of CO2-derived changes. In this study, we use long- term weather records and field data from the Jasper Ridge CO2 experiment in Pale Alto, California, to model the effects of CO2 and climate variability on ecosystem water fluxes. The sandstone and serpentine grasslands at Jasper Ridge provide a range of primary productivity and LAI, with the sandstone as the more productive system. Modeled soil water availability agreed well with published observations of time-domain reflectometry in the CO2 experiment. Simulated water fluxes based on 10-year weather data (January 1985-December 1994) showed that the sandstone grassland had a much greater proportion of water movement through plants than did the serpentine; transpiration accounted for approximately 30% of annual fluxes in the sandstone and only 10% in the serpentine. Although simulated physiological and biomass changes were similar in both grasslands, the consequences of elevated CO2 were greater for the sandstone water budget. Elevated CO2 increased soil drainage by 20% in the sandstone, despite an approximately one-fifth increase in plant biomass; in the serpentine, drainage increased by <10% and soil evaporation was unchanged for the same simulated biomass change. Phenological changes, simulated by a 15-day lengthening of the growing season, had minimal impacts on the water budget. Annual variation in the timing and amount of rainfall was important for water fluxes in both grasslands. Elevated CO2 increased sandstone drainage > 50 mm in seven of ten years, but the relative increase in drainage varied from 10% to 300% depending on the year. Early-season transpiration in the sandstone decreased between 26% and 41%, with elevated CO2 resulting in a simulated water savings of 54-76 mm. Even in years when precipitation was similar (e.g., 505 and 479 mm in years 3 and 4), the effect of CO2 varied dramatically. The response of grassland water budgets to CO2 depends on the productivity and structure of the grassland, the amount and timing of rainfall, and CO2-induced changes in physiology. In systems with low LAT, large physiological changes may not necessarily alter total ecosystem water budgets dramatically.2147^5^Lal,M^Singh,KK^Rathore,LS^Srinivasan,G^Saseendran,SA^1998^1^Vulnerability of rice and wheat yields in NW India to future changes in climate^107^89^2^101-114^^^^^Feb^^^^^70561221^130^3199^51^on in the timing and amount of rainfall was important for water fluxes in both grasslands.

In spite of the uncertainties about the precise magnitude of climate change on regional scales, an assessment of the possible impacts of changes in key climatic elements on our agricultural resources is important for formulating response strategies. In this study, vulnerability of wheat and rice crops in northwest India to the projected climate change is examined. CERES wheat and rice models adopted for the study were validated for their ability to reproduce yields at the selected NW Indian stations. The sensitivity experiments with these models showed higher yields for both wheat and rice (28% and 15% respectively for a doubling of CO2) under elevated CO2 levels. A 3 degrees C (2 degrees C) rise in air temperature nearly cancels out the positive effect of elevated CO2 on the wheat (rice) yields. While the wheat crops are found to be sensitive to increase in maximum temperature, the rice crops are vulnerable to increase in minimum temperature. The combined effect of enhanced CO2 and imposed thermal stress on the wheat (rice) crop is 21% (4%) increase in yield for the irrigation schedule presently practised in the region. While the adverse impacts of likely water shortage on wheat crops would be minimised to a certain extent under elevated CO2 levels, they would largely be maintained for the rice crops resulting in about 20% net decline in rice yields. In general, acute water shortage conditions combined with the thermal stress should adversely affect both the wheat and more severely the rice productivity in NW India even under the positive effects of elevated CO2 in the future.

Thirty seven days after the begin of the experiment the plants were exposed to a 10 day pulse of 400 or 1200 mu M Al. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased both root production and loss. Exposure to Al reduced root production and slightly reduced root loss. The reduced root production due to Al was amplified after the pulse had receded, resulting in a significantly lower net and gross root production at the end of the experiment.

This study was designed to develop mechanistic understanding of the nonlinear responses with both experimental and modelling approaches. Soybean (Glycine max) was grown in five levels of C-g (280, 350, 525, 700, 1000 ppm) with either a high or low rate of nitrogen fertilization. When the rate of nitrogen fertilization was high, the photosynthetic rate measured at C-g was highest in plants from the 700 ppm CO2 treatment. When the rate of nitrogen fertilization was low, little variation was observed in the photosynthetic rates of plants from the different treatments measured at their respective C-g. Measurements of CO2-induced changes in mass- based leaf nitrogen concentration (n(m) an index of changes in biochemical processes) and leaf mass per unit area (h, an index of morphological properties) were used in a model and indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic responses to C-g is largely determined by relative changes in photosynthetic sensitivity, biochemical downregulation, and morphological upregulation. In order to further understand the nonlinear responses, we compiled data from the literature on CO2-induced changes in n(m) and h. These compiled data indicate that h generally increases and n(m) usually decreases with increasing C-g, but that the trajectories and magnitudes of the changes in h and n(m) vary with species and growth environments. Integration of these variables (n(m) and h) into a biochemically based model of photosynthesis enabled us to predict diverse responses of photosynthesis to C-g. Thus a general mechanism is suggested for the highly variable, nonlinear responses of photosynthesis to C-g reported in the literature.2150^2^Matysiak,B^Nowak,J^1998^1^Acclimatization and the growth of Ficus benjamina microcuttings as affected by carbon dioxide concentration^361^73^2^185-188^^^^^Mar^^^^^70621491^243^376^674^781^onlinearity of photosyntheA^7061^The influence of CO2 concentrations (350 and 1200 mu mol mol(- 1)) on the growth of Ficus benjamina microcuttings cv.

An inverse relationship between stomatal density/index and atmospheric CO2 concentration has been documented for all the studies to date concerning fossil and subfossil material. Furthermore, this relationship has been demonstrated experimentally by growing plants under elevated and reduced CO2 concentrations. To date, the mechanism that controls the stomatal density response to atmospheric CO2 concentration remains unknown. However, stomatal parameters of fossil plants have been successfully used as a proxy indicator of palaeo-CO2 levels. This paper presents new estimates of palaeoatmospheric CO2 concentrations for the Middle Eocene (Lutetian), based on the stomatal ratios of fossil Lauraceae species from Bournemouth in England. Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations derived from stomatal data from plants of the Early Devonian, Late Carboniferous, Early Permian and Middle Jurassic ages are reviewed in the light of new data. Semi-quantitative palaeo-CO2 estimates based on the stomatal ratio (a ratio of the stomatal index of a fossil plant to that of a selected nearest living equivalent) have in the past relied on the use of a Carboniferous standard. The application of a new standard based on the present-day CO2 level is reported here for comparison. The resultant ranges of palaeo-CO2 estimates made from standardized fossil stomatal ratio data are in good agreement with both carbon isotopic data from terrestrial and marine sources and long-term carbon cycle modelling estimates for all the time periods studied. These data indicate elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the Early Devonian, Middle Jurassic and Middle Eocene, and reduced concentrations during the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian.

Primura) in 1995 in Italy. Three FACE rings were used to fumigate circular field plots of 8 m diameter while two rings were used as controls at ambient CO2 concentrations. Four CO2 exposure levels were used in the rings (ambient, 460, 560 and 660 mu mol mol-l). Phenology and crop development, canopy surface temperature, above-and below- ground biomass were monitored during the growing season. Crop phenology was affected by elevated CO2, as the date of flowering was progressively anticipated in the 660, 560, 460 mu mol mol(-1) treatments. Crop development was not affected significantly as plant height, leaf area and the number of leaves per plant were the same in the four treatments. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels had, instead, a significant effect on the accumulation of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC = soluble sugars + starch) in the leaves during a sunny day. Specific leaf area was decreased under elevated CO2 with a response that paralleled that of TNC concentrations. This reflected the occurrence of a progressive increase of photosynthetic rates and carbon assimilation in plants exposed to increasingly higher levels of atmospheric CO2. Tuber growth and final tuber yield were also stimulated by rising CO2 levels. When calculated by regression of tuber yield vs. the imposed levels of CO(2)concentration, yield stimulation was as large as 10% every 100 mu mol mol(-1) increase, which translated into over 40% enhancement in yield under 660 mu mol mol(-1). This was related to a higher number of tubers rather than greater mean tuber mass or size. Leaf senescence was accelerated under elevated CO2 and a linear relationship was found between atmospheric CO2 levels and leaf reflectance measured at 0.55 mu m wavelength.

Minaret was grown to maturity under three carbon dioxide (CO2) and two ozone (O-3) concentrations in open-top chambers (OTC). Green leaf area index (LAI) was increased by elevated CO2 under ambient O-3 conditions as a direct result of increases in tillering, rather than individual leaf areas. Yellow LAI was also greater in the 550 and 680 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 treatments than in the chambered ambient control; individual leaves on the main shoot senesced more rapidly under 550 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, but senescence was delayed at 680 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Fractional light interception (f) during the vegetative period was up to 26% greater under 680 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 than in the control treatment, but seasonal accumulated intercepted radiation was only increased by 8%. As a result of greater carbon assimilation during canopy development, plants grown under elevated CO2 were taller at anthesis and stem and ear biomass were 27 and 16% greater than in control plants. At maturity, yield was 30% greater in the 680 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 treatment, due to a combination of increases in the number of ears per m(- 2), grain number per ear and individual grain weight (IGW). Exposure to a seasonal mean (7 h d(-1)) of 84 nmol mol(-1) O-3 under ambient CO2 decreased green LAI and increased yellow LAI, thereby reducing both f and accumulated intercepted radiation by approximate to 16%. Individual leaves senesced completely 7- 28 days earlier than in control plants. At anthesis, the plants were shorter than controls and exhibited reductions in stem and ear biomass of 15 and 23%. Grain yield at maturity was decreased by 30% due to a combination of reductions in ear number m(-2), the numbers of grains per spikelet and per ear and IGW. The presence of elevated CO2 reduced the rate of O-3- induced leaf senescence and resulted in the maintenance of a higher green LAI during vegetative growth under ambient CO2 conditions. Grain yields at maturity were nevertheless lower than those obtained in the corresponding elevated CO2 treatments in the absence of elevated O-3. Thus, although the presence of elevated CO2 reduced the damaging impact of ozone on radiation interception and vegetative growth, substantial yield losses were nevertheless induced. These data suggest that spring wheat may be susceptible to O-3-induced injury during anthesis irrespective of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Possible deleterious mechanisms operating through effects on pollen viability, seed set and the duration of grain filling are discussed.2154^3^Ong,BL^Koh,CKK^Wee,YC^1998^1^Effects of CO2 on growth and photosynthesis of Pyrrosia piloselloides (L.)

Total above ground biomass and grain yield were greater at elevated CO2 concentrations and with increasing phosphorus supply. The CO2 response was evident at all but the lowest phosphorus treatments but its magnitude was greater at moderate phosphorus supplies.

Xerophyta scabrida is a DT woody shrub, which loses chlorophylls and thylakoids during desiccation: a so-called poikilochlorophyllous desiccation-tolerant species (PDT), When the leaves of X. scabria are allowed to desiccate, the species shows many of the normal features of (P)DT plants. 2. However, the duration of:photosynthesis in X. scabria is prolonged by 300% when the measurements are: made at 700 as opposed to 350 p.p.m. CO2. The implication is that the carboxylating enzymes must still have been active at this time to enable appreciable photosynthetic activity, This response could have far-reaching implications for the success of such species in a future climate. 3.

It is concluded that desiccation- tolerant plants will be among the main beneficiaries of a high CO2 future.2159^2^Vasseur,L^Potvin,C^1998^1^Natural pasture community response to enriched carbon dioxide atmosphere^331^135^1^31-41^^^^^Mar^^^^^70801684^1727^372^417^507^540^57^672^92^hen the measurements are: made at 700 as opposed to 350 p.p.m. CO2.

The study was conducted using open-top growth chambers directly placed on top of the natural pasture community. To investigate the change in the overall species composition in time and space, we used canonical correspondence analysis, a direct ordination method. Over the three years, the overall community responded significantly to enriched CO2. The analyses show that, after three years, CO2 was the most important environmental variable affecting the species composition. Initially the presence of the wall of the chambers influenced the composition but CO2 became more important by the third year. Soil and air temperatures only slightly influenced the community composition. The first two axes of the canonical correspondence analysis explained a large proportion of the variation in the three years and these trends appeared to increase with time. Species such as Agropyron repens appeared to be positively influenced by the presence of the wall (slightly warmer conditions). However, the analyses suggest that Phleum pratense and Trifolium repens, for example, were favored by the increase in atmospheric CO2. The variation in species composition in enriched versus ambient CO2 chambers suggests that the effect of the environmental factors, particularly CO2, were important in affecting the rate and pattern of succession. Furthermore, the temporal increase in importance of the variable CO2 in the present analyses indicates that there might be a time-lag in response to atmospheric enrichment.2160^3^Volin,JC^Reich,PB^Givnish,TJ^1998^1^Elevated carbon dioxide ameliorates the effects of ozone on photosynthesis and growth: species respond similarly regardless of photosynthetic pathway or plant functional group^84^138^2^315-325^^^^^Feb^^^^^70821828^2034^2993^3210^344^360^376^389^444^587^ation in the three years and these trends appeared to increase with time. Species such as AgropyrA^7081^Due to their different physiological effects, elevated carbon dioxide and elevated ozone might have interactive impacts on plants, and differentially so on plants differing in photosynthetic pathway and growth rate. To test several hypotheses related to these issues, we examined the physiological, morphological and growth responses of six perennial species grown at various atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone. The species involved (two C-3 trees: Populus tremuloides Michx., Quercus rubra L.; two C-3 grasses: Agropyron smithii Rybd., Koeleria cristata L.; two C-4 grasses: Bouteloua curtipendula Michx., Schizachyrium scoparium Michx.) differed in growth form, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic pathway. In situ photosynthesis, relative growth rate (RGR) and its determinants (leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio and root weight ratio) were determined via sequential harvests of seedlings that were grown in all combinations of 366 or 672 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and 3 or 95 nmol mol(-1) O-3 over a 101-d period. Elevated CO2 had minimal effect on either photosynthesis or RGR. By contrast, RGR for all six species was lower in high O-3 concentrations at ambient CO2, significantly so in A. smithii and P. tremuloides. Five of the six species also exhibited reductions in in situ photosynthesis at ambient CO2 in high-O-3-grown compared with low-O-3-grown plants. For all species, these O-3-induced reductions in RGR and photosynthesis were absent in the elevated CO2 environment. Root weight ratio was significantly reduced by elevated O-3 in A. smithii and P. tremuloides in ambient but not elevated CO2. Species with high stomatal conductance were the most susceptible to oxidant injury, while those with low stomatal conductance, such as the C-4 species and Q. rubra, were not as detrimentally affected by O-3. Elevated levels of CO2 will reduce stomatal conductance and O-3 uptake, and might therefore reduce the potential for oxidant damage. However, there was a stronger relationship of the percent reduction in whole-plant mass due to O-3, related to the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance. In general, results of this study of six functionally diverse plant species suggest that O-3 pollution effects on carbon balance and growth are likely to be ameliorated by elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2.2161^4^Walker,RF^Geisinger,DR^Johnson,DW^Ball,JT^1998^1^Atmospheric CO2 enrichment and soil N fertility effects on juvenile ponderosa pine: Growth, ectomycorrhizal development, and xylem water potential^45^102^1^33-44^^^^^3 Mar^^^^^70841334^2093^224^2426^3003^341^372^374^419^680^ not elevated CO2.

One-year- old seedlings were planted in undisturbed field soil within open-top chambers which permitted creation of atmospheres with 700 mu l l(-1), 525 mu l l(-1), or ambient CO2 concentrations. High and medium soil N treatments were imposed by incorporating sufficient (NH4)(2)SO4 to increase total N by 200 mu g g(-1) and 100 mu g g(-1), respectively, while unamended soil, which had a total N concentration of approximately 900 mu g g(-1), constituted the low N treatment. Following each of two consecutive field growing seasons, whole seedlings of every combination of CO2 and N treatment were harvest-ed to permit assessment of shoot and root growth and quantification of ectomycorrhizal development. Late in the second growing season, a simulated drought episode was imposed by withholding irrigation during which predawn and midday xylem water potential and soil water potential were measured. The initial harvest revealed that coarse and fine root weights were increased by CO2 enrichment during the first growing season. This result was most apparent in the 525 mu l l(-1) CO2 treatment and high soil N, which produced the greatest root volume as well. Shoot/root ratio decreased with increasing CO2 at the first harvest. After two growing seasons, elevated CO2 increased seedling diameter, shoot and root volume, and shoot and coarse root weight, again most prominently in high N. Unlike the initial results, however, stimulation of seedling growth by the 700 mu l l(-1) CO2 atmosphere exceeded that in 525 mu l l(-1) CO2 after two growing seasons, and shoot/root ratio was unaffected by either CO2 or N. At both harvests, seedlings grown in the enriched atmospheres generally had higher mycorrhizal counts and greater percentages of colonized root length, but differences among treatments in ectomycorrhizal development were nonsignificant regardless of quantification method. During the imposed drought episode, xylem water potential of seedlings grown in elevated CO2 descended below that of seedlings grown in the ambient atmosphere as soil water potential decreased, most notably in the predawn measurements. These results suggest that CO2 enrichment stimulates shoot and root growth of juvenile ponderosa pine under field conditions, a response somewhat dependent on soil N availability. However, below-ground growth is not increased proportionally more than that above ground, which may predispose this species to greater stress when soil water is limited.

Results from the first year of operation in 1994 showed that the period of continuous snow cover was increased by 90 d. The deeper and earlier snowpack behind the fence insulated soils from winter air temperatures, resulting in a 9 degrees C increase in annual minimum temperature at the soil surface. The extended period of snow cover resulted in subnivial microbial activity playing a major role in annual C and N cycling. The amount of C mineralized under the snow as measured by CO2 production was 22 g m(-2) in 1993 and 35 g m(- 2) in 1994, accounting for 20% of annual net primary aboveground production before construction of the snow fence in 1993 and 31% after the snow fence was constructed in 1994. In a similar fashion, maximum subnivial N2O flux increased 3-fold behind the snow fence, from 75 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) in 1993 to 250 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) in 1994. The amount of N lost from denitrification was greater than the annual atmospheric input of N in snowfall. Surface litter decomposition studies show that there was a significant increase in the litter mass loss under deep and early snow, with no significant change under medium and little snow conditions. Changes in climate that result in differences in snow duration, depth, and extent may therefore produce large changes in the C and N soil dynamics of alpine ecosystems.2163^2^Yamauchi,N^Watada,AE^1998^1^Chlorophyll and xanthophyll changes in broccoli florets stored under elevated CO2 or ethylene-containing atmosphere^170^33^1^114-117^^^^^Feb^^^^^7088 m(-2)1246^1678^3216^454^601^A^7087^Chlorophylls and xanthophylls were monitored in broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plen.) florets stored in air, air + 10 ppm ethylene, or 10% CO2 + 1% O-2 controlled atmosphere (CA) at 15 degrees C.

In 1993/94, grain yield of cv. Avalon was insensitive to mean temperature (between 8.8 and 10.9 degrees C), while elevated CO2 increased yield by 1.3 t ha(-1) (12.6%). In all other cultivars, warming reduced grain yield and CO2 increased grain yield. In 1993/94, in cvs Galahad and Mercia the effects of CO2 and temperature on yield were additive. However, for cv. Hereward in both years and for cv. Soissons in 1994/95, there were negative interactions between the effects of CO2 and temperature on yield: the maximum benefit of doubling CO2 to grain yield, 4.5 and 2.7 t ha(-1) (65 and 29%) respectively, occurred at cooler temperatures; there was no benefit from doubling CO2 (i.e. 0%) once the temperature had increased above the seasonal mean by 2.2-2.6 degrees C in cv.

In addition to the fertilizer, all tubs received N-15-ammonium nitrate as a marker. Elevated CO2 significantly increased biomass production in alder, but had no effect on oak and ash. In beech, due to disease and mortality in all treatments, any possible effects were obscured. The addition of fertilizer had no effect on biomass production in alder, but increased production in oak and ash significantly. In oak a treatment synergism may be present. The non-appearance of a synergistic CO2 and fertilizer effect in alder may be explained by a fertilizer induced reduction of the N-fixing root-nodule biomass concurrent with a switch of the N-assimilation from atmospheric N to soil N supply, as the delta(15)N measurements in the leaves of alder as opposed to oak indicate. Although elevated CO2 resulted in a significant biomass increase in alder, it did not lead to an appreciable increase in the proportional presence of the species as measured on total plant biomass in the tub.

'Elsanta') plants were acclimatized to 300, 450, 600, 750 or 900 ppm CO2 in controlled environment chambers for 50 and 60 days during vegetative growth in late autumn of 1995 and reproductive growth in early spring of 1996. High CO2 promoted branch-crown and pedicel development as well as flower-bud differentiation. It also induced a second bloom. Flowering and fruit ripening started earlier and lasted for a longer period under high rather than low CO2 concentrations. CO2 enrichment shortened the periods of anthesis and single fruit growth but prolonged the periods of flowering and fruit harvest. Elevated CO2 concentrations enhanced fruit productivity as indicated by increases in pedicel number per plant, fruit setting per pedicel, fruit size, and dry matter content of the fruits. In comparison with the 300 ppm CO2 treatment, 450, 600, 750, and 900 ppm CO2 increased average fruit yield per plant by 0.7, 2.7, 3.6, and 4.1 fold, daily growth per fresh fruit by 0.4, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3 fold, and growth rate of fruit biomass per plant by 1.0, 3.9, 5.5, and 6.9 fold, respectively. High CO2 tended to improve fruit quality as well. Raising CO2 concentrations accelerated dry matter increment and total sugar accumulation in the fruits, especially for sucrose, and decreased titratable acid content, resulting in a higher sugar/acid ratio of the fruits. Contents of starch and minerals in the fruits slightly decreased when CO2 rose.2172^3^Cheng,SH^Moore,BD^Seemann,JR^1998^1^Effects of short- and long-term elevated CO2 on the expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase genes and carbohydrate accumulation in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh^8^116^2^715-723^^^^^Feb^^^^^71061026^1699^1826^1871^2000^243^2557^3218^3219^786^l, fruit size, and dry matter content of the fruits.

Long-term growth of Arabidopsis at high CO2 (1000 mu L L-1) resulted in a 2-fold increase in nonstructural carbohydrates, a large decrease in the expression of Rubisco protein and in the transcript of rbcL, the gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco (approximately 35-40%), and an even greater decline in mRNA of rbcS, the gene encoding the small subunit (approximately 60%). This differential response of protein and mRNAs suggests that transcriptional/posttranscriptional processes and protein turnover may determine the final amount of leaf Rubisco protein at high CO2. Analysis of mRNA levels of individual rbcS genes indicated that reduction in total rbcS transcripts was caused by decreased expression of all four rbcS genes. Short-term transfer of Arabidopsis plants grown at ambient CO2 to high CO2 resulted in a decrease in total rbcS mRNA by d 6, whereas Rubisco content and rbcL mRNA decreased by d 9. Transfer to high CO2 reduced the maximum expression level of the primary rbcS genes (1A and, particularly, 3B) by limiting their normal pattern of accumulation through the night period. The decreased nighttime levels of rbcS mRNA were associated with a nocturnal increase in leaf hexoses. We suggest that prolonged nighttime hexose metabolism resulting from exposure to elevated CO2 affects rbcS transcript accumulation and, ultimately, the level of Rubisco protein.2173^2^Curtis,PS^Wang,XZ^1998^1^A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form, and physiology^2^113^3^299-313^^^^^Feb^^^^^71081074^1342^1344^1633^1660^2489^256^377^419^595^protein at high CO2.

We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (WT) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of WT by half, from + 31 % under optimal conditions to + 16 %, while low light increased the response to + 52 %. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+ 19 %) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+ 54 %). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots < 0.51 (- 36 %) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance.

(C) 1998 Elsevier ScienceA^7111^We studied an effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on rhizosphere microorganisms in a hydroponics system where young wheat plants provided the only source of C for microorganisms. Plants were cultivated in mineral solution in sterile silica sand and exposed to control (ambient) and elevated (double) CO2 concentrations for periods of 13, 20, 25 and 34 days. Microbial biomass C (C content in fraction of size 0.3-2.7 mu m) was not affected by the elevated CO2 concentration during the first 25 days of plant growth and was increased after 34 days of plant growth. A content of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) reserve compounds (measured as derivatized product of 3-hydroxy-butyric acid and N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoracetamide using GC-MS) was lowered significantly (p<0.001) in the elevated CO2 after 25 and 34 days. It was accompanied with a shift of bacterial distribution towards the nutritional groups utilising more complex organic material (number of CFUs on media with different sources of C and N). A coincidence of several events connected with plant and microbial carbon economy (decrease of an assimilation rate and relative growth rate of plants, small increase of microbial biomass, PHB decrease and suppression within the bacterial nutritional group requiring the most readily available source of C and energy) was observed in the system under elevated CO2 on the 25th day.

As for other greenhouse crops, tomato tissues are specific in that they have a high mineral content. The consequences of this accumulation of minerals on the construction cost of the tissues and the possible interactions with the physiological age of the organs and with the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was examined. For that purpose, three methods of estimating the construction cost were used and compared. Large quantities of minerals accumulated in the tissues of tomato plants (ranging from 0.05 in fruits to 0.26 g g(-1) DM in leaves). The subsequent dilution of the organic matter explained why the estimated construction cost of the dry matter (organic matter + minerals) was fairly low in comparison to that of other crop species. The construction cost was higher in fruits than in vegetative organs, partly because of a lower mineral content. It decreased by 7-12% from top to bottom of the canopy, following the increase in the physiological age of the tissues. This ontogenic drift was partly explained by the accumulation of minerals in the older organs. In the conditions of CO2 enrichment of a commercial greenhouse, no effect of CO2 concentration on the mineral content and on the construction cost of tissues was observed. Such a variability of the construction cost of tomato plant tissues due to the accumulation of minerals or to the ontogeny questions the use of standard values in crop models.2177^3^Heagle,AS^Miller,JE^Booker,FL^1998^1^Influence of ozone stress on soybean response to carbon dioxide enrichment: I.

Little is known about plant response to mixtures of O-3 and CO2. Open-top field chambers were ere used to determine if foliar responses of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to CO2 enrichment are affected by O-3 stress and vice versa. Plants were grown in 14-L pots and exposed to four CO2 and three O-3 concentrations in 12 combinations. The CO2 treatments were ambient (366 mu L L-1) and three treatments with CO2 added for 24 h d(-1) at approximately 1.3, 1.6, and 2.0 times ambient. The O-3 treatments were charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered air (NF), and NF with O-3 added for 12 h d(-1) (NF+), resulting in seasonal concentrations of approximately 20, 46, and 75 nL L-1. Foliar effects of CO2 enrichment were dependent on the amount of stress caused by O-3 In the CF treatment, plants were not stressed by O-3, and CO2 enrichment caused chlorosis and decreased chlorophyll. In the IVF and NF+ treatments, plants were stressed by O-3, and CO2 enrichment suppressed chlorosis and increased chlorophyll. Ozone decreased specific leaf weight, increased foliar N and C, and decreased C/N ratios, whereas CO2 caused opposite responses for these measures. Ozone increased foliar S and B but did not affect P or K concentrations. Conversely, CO2 enrichment suppressed foliar S, B, P, and K concentrations. These interactions between O-3 and CO2 emphasize a need to consider the amount of plant stress caused by O-3 in studies to measure effects of CO2 enrichment.2178^3^Heagle,AS^Miller,JE^Pursley,WA^1998^1^Influence of ozone stress on soybean response to carbon dioxide enrichment: III.

Plants were exposed from emergence to maturity to four CO2 levels (ambient and 1.3, 1.6, and 2.0 times ambient) and three O-3 levels (0.4, 0.9, and 1.5 times ambient) in 12 combinations. Increasing O-3 suppressed growth and yield, whereas CO2 enrichment stimulated growth and yield. Carbon dioxide-induced stimulation was greater for plants stressed by O-3 than for non stressed plants. For example, CO2 at 2.0 times ambient increased 2-yr mean seed yield of Essex by 16, 24, and 81% at O-3 levels of O.4, 0.9, and 1.5 times ambient, respectively. Effects of O-3 and CO2 on seed oil content were variable with numerous cultivar differences. Seed protein content was never affected. Elevated O-3 suppressed oleic acid content in seeds, whereas CO2 increased it; the nature of the O-3 x CO2 interaction for oleic acid was similar to that observed for most yield measures. Carbon dioxide-induced stimulation of plants stressed by O-3 was apparently caused partly by amelioration of O-3 stress. Interactions between O-3 and CO2 must be considered for proper interpretation of cause-effect relationships in CO2 enrichment studies.2179^10^Karnosky,DF^Podila,GK^Gagnon,Z^Pechter,P^Akkapeddi,A^Sheng,Y^Riemenschneider,DE^Coleman,MD^Dickson,RE^Isebrands,JG^1998^1^Genetic control of responses to interacting tropospheric ozone and CO2 in Populus tremuloides^362^36^4-5^807-812^^^^^Feb^^^^^71202054^264^3225^3226^344^423^58^633^738^92^ 2.0 times ambient increased 2-yr mean seed yield of Essex by 16, 24, and 81% at O-3 levels of O.4, 0.9, and 1.5 times ambient, respectively.

Ozone in the range of 80 ppm hr (Sum 00) per growing season decreased height, diameter, and stem and leaf biomass slightly in a tolerant clone but severely in a sensitive clone. Elevated CO2 (150 ppm over ambient) did not compensate for the O-3 effects. Antioxidant enzyme analysis showed elevated SOD levels in the tolerant clone but not in the sensitive clone following O-3 exposure. Northern blot analysis indicated that the chloroplastic and cytosolic Cu/Zn SOD's were significantly increased in response to O-3 in the tolerant but not the sensitive clone. Currently, we are conducting molecular analysis to determine the functional significance of SOD's in regulating O-3 tolerance in aspen.

Plants were grown in pots with adequate nutrient and water supply and were exposed to ambient and above ambient CO2 concentrations (approximately + 80 ppm, + 160 ppm, + 280 ppm) in open-top chambers for two seasons. Nitrogen fertilizer was given only before the experiment started to promote N-2 fixation. Plants were clipped to a height of 5 cm, when the canopy had reached a height of about 20 cm and when the CO2 effect had not been diminished due to self-shading of the leaves. Photon exposure (400-700 nm) measured above the canopy was linearly related to the above ground biomass, the leaf area index and the nitrogen yield (r(2)>0.94). The slopes of the curves depended on the CO2 concentration. Since most of the radiation (>90%) was absorbed by the foliage, the slopes were used to calculate the CO2 effect on the radiation use efficiency of biomass production, which is shown to increase curvilinearly between 380 and 660 ppm CO2 from 2.7 g MJ(-1) to 3.9 g MJ(-1). CO2 enrichment increased above ground biomass by increasing the leaf number, the individual leaf weight and the leaf area; specific leaf weight was not affected. The relative CO2 response varied between harvests; there was a slight but not significant positive relationship with mean daytime temperature. At the beginning of the season, plant nitrogen concentration in the above ground biomass was decreased by CO2 enrichment.

The aim was to study how reduced N or water supply affect the CO2 response of shoot and root growth, in relationship to changes in the plant C/N ratio. Plant growth was monitored non- destructively, and shoot dry mass was determined after 41 days (first growth period) and after 67 days (second growth period). Stubble and root dry mass, and C/N ratios in roots and shoots were measured only after regrowth. Elevated CO2 continuously stimulated growth of the mixture, and increased the shoot biomass in the absence of N or water limitations without changing the shoot/root dry weight ratio, nor the C/N ratio. The CO2-effect on orchard grass tended to be stronger than the effect on red clover, and was more pronounced during the first as compared to the second growth period. At low N, yield of red clover showed the stronger CO2 response, whereas with reduced water supply the relative CO2-stimulation of shoot biomass in orchard grass was more pronounced. Both low-N and reduced water supply decreased shoot, root, and stubble biomass, decreased the shoot/root ratio, and increased the C/N ratio. Elevated CO2 reduced negative effects of limited N or water supply on shoot growth, but the positive CO2 effect at low N declined with time. The interaction between CO2 and N was most pronounced for stubble mass, whereas the interaction between CO2 and reduced water supply was only significant for root mass. It is concluded that changes in shoot/root ratio are mainly caused by low N and reduced water supply via changes in the N-status of the plant, and that elevated CO2 has little effect on the shoot/root ratio, but tends to reduce negative effects of limiting N and water on growth.

AA^7131^Previous research has shown that elevated CO2 concentrations can increase plant growth, whereas the air pollutant O-3 is phytotoxic. Because elevated concentrations of these gases will co-occur, the objective of our experiment was to determine if estimates of plant growth response to future levels of CO2 and O-3 require experiments to test the gases in combination. Soybean plants [Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Essex) were exposed in open-top chambers to combinations of O-3 and CO2 from plant emergence through physiological maturity. Ozone treatments were charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered sir (NF), and NF with O-3 added for 12 h d(-1) (NF+) (seasonal mean 12 h d(-1) O-3 concentrations of 20, 50, or 79 nL L-1, respectively). Carbon dioxide exposures were for 24 h d(-1) giving seasonal mean 12 h d(-1) concentrations of 370, 482, 599, or 713 mu L L-1 Over the season, elevated CO2 usually stimulated growth and O-3 suppressed growth. Elevated CO2 usually increased partitioning of biomass to branches, decreased partitioning to pods, increased specific leaf weight, and decreased leaf area ratio. Ozone suppressed leaf and root weight ratios, increased pod weight ratios, and decreased specific leaf weight. Toward the end of the season, both O-3 and CO2 accelerated reproductive development. Elevated CO2 moderated suppression of growth by O- 3, and the highest CO2 concentration completely ameliorated O-3 effects on main stem biomass, root biomass, and leaf area. Ozone, however, limited some positive growth responses to CO2, especially at less than a doubling of CO2 concentrations. These results indicate that in order to understand the future impacts of atmospheric gases such as elevated CO2 and O-3 On crop growth, their combined effects should be determined.2186^5^Rillig,MC^Allen,MF^Klironomos,JN^Chiariello,NR^Field,CB^1998^1^Plant species-specific changes in root-inhabiting fungi in a California annual grassland: responses to elevated CO2 and nutrients^2^113^2^252-259^^^^^Jan^^^^^7134 biomass to branches, dec1334^1675^1781^1981^1983^376^377^433^778^849^c leaf weight, and decreased leaf area ratio.

The plants were exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 and soil nutrient enrichment in a complete factorial experiment. The response of root-inhabiting non- mycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to the altered resource base depended strongly on the plant species. Elevated CO2 and fertilization altered the ratio of non-mycorrhizal to mycorrhizal fungal colonization for some plant species, but not for others. Percent root infection by non-mycorrhizal fungal increased by over 500% for Linanthus parviflorus in elevated CO2, but decreased by over 80% for Bromus hordeaceus. By contrast, the mean percent infection by mycorrhizal fungi increased in response to elevated CO2 for all species, but significantly only for Avena barbata and B. hordeaceus. Percent infection by mycorrhizal fungi increased, decreased, or remained unchanged for different plant hosts in response to fertilization. There was evidence of a strong interaction between the two treatments for some plant species and non- mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal fungi. This study demonstrated plant species-and soil fertility-dependent shifts in belowground plant resource allocation to different morphogroups of fungal symbionts. This may have consequences for plant community responses to elevated CO2 in this California grassland ecosystem.2187^2^Rusterholz,HP^Erhardt,A^1998^1^Effects of elevated CO2 on flowering phenology and nectar production of nectar plants important for butterflies of calcareous grasslands^2^113^3^341-349^^^^^Feb^^^^^71362584^3233^3234^342^345^374^376^377^489^92^ecreased by over 80% for Bromus hordeaceus.

In glasshouse experiments, juvenile plants were exposed to ambient (350 mu l l(-1)) and elevated (660 mu l l(- 1)) CO2 concentrations for 60-80 days. Elevated CO2 significantly enhanced the development of flower buds in C. jacea. B. officinalis flowered earlier and L. corniculatus produced more flowers under elevated CO2. In contrast, the number of flowers decreased in T. pratense. The amount of nectar per flower was not affected by elevated CO2 in the tested legumes (T. pratense and L. corniculatus), but was significantly reduced (!) in the other forbs. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect nectar sugar concentration and composition. However, S. columbaria and C. jacea produced significantly less total sugar under elevated CO2. The nectar amino acid concentration remained unaffected in all investigated plant species, whereas the total of amino acids produced per flower was reduced in all non-legumes. In addition, the amino acid composition changed significantly in all investigated species except for C. jacea. The observed effects are unexpected and are a potential threat to flower visitors such as most butterflies which have no alternative food resources to nectar. Changes in nectar production due to elevated CO2 could also have generally detrimental effects on the interactions of flowers and their pollinators.2188^5^Sgherri,CLM^Quartacci,MF^Menconi,M^Raschi,A^Navari-Izzo,F^1998^1^Interactions between drought and elevated CO2 on alfalfa plants^4^152^1^118-124^^^^^Jan^^^^^7138264^2821^3235^377^546^829^92^significantly reduced (!) in the other forbs.

Under high CO2 concentration leaf nitrogen content decreased whereas starch accumulation and a higher proteolytic activity were recorded. Following water depletion, CO2-enriched plants showed a decrease in total non- structural carbhydrates and soluble proteins.

In 2 feeding trials, mature needles produced in the previous (spring) and current (fall) year from seedlings grown in open-topped chambers under 4 CO2 and 2 soil nutrient levels were fed to 2 separate generations of redheaded pine sawfly larvae. Strong seasonal differences (i.e., spring versus fall) in leaf nutritional and defensive constituents resulted in significant between-generation differences in the growth, consumption, and growth efficiency of sawfly larvae, Enriched CO2-grown needles had higher levels of starch and starch/nitrogen ratios in older, overwintering spring needles, which were lower in leaf nitrogen and monoterpenes than younger, current year needles (fall). Overall, larval growth was higher and consumption lower on the fall needles, presumably because of higher levels of leaf nitrogen compared with the spring needles. The plant CO2 concentration significantly contributed to the larval consumption responses between seasons (significant CO2 X season interaction), demonstrating that the 2 sawfly generations were affected differently by CO2-induced phytochemical alterations in spring versus fall needles. The data presented here suggests that when investigating multivoltine folivorous insect responses to elevated CO2-grown tree seedlings in which multiple leaf flushes within a growing season expose insects to an array of leaf phytochemical changes, >1 insect generation should be investigated.2192^2^Zebian,KJ^Reekie,EG^1998^1^The interactive effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide and light on stem elongation in seedlings of four species^52^81^2^185-193^^^^^Feb^^^^^7146310^372^374^376^417^568^669^705^740^92^d monoterpenes than younger, current year needles (fall).

Karsten, were grown in three light regimes: darkness, low light (25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 10 min d(-1)) and high light (120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 12 h d(-1)) and four levels of carbon dioxide: 0, 350, 700 and 1400 +/- 50 mu l l(-1). Germination was not affected by any of the treatments. The effects of carbon dioxide on stem elongation were identical in low and high light: stem length increased at a decreasing rate with level of carbon dioxide in all species. Level of carbon dioxide also affected stem elongation in complete darkness, but the pattern was more complex and varied among species. Total weight did not vary with level of carbon dioxide to any significant extent in either darkness or low light, but increased with level of carbon dioxide at high light in all four species. Due to the absence of any effect of carbon dioxide on growth in darkness and low light, we suggest the effects of carbon dioxide on stem elongation are independent of effects on growth and may be due to a direct interaction with developmental processes. In contrast, level of carbon dioxide had little effect on allocation patterns in the dark and low light experiments, but had marked effects in high light. Therefore, the effect of carbon dioxide on allocation was probably due to the effects of carbon dioxide on growth rather than to any direct interaction between carbon dioxide and development. An understanding of the mechanisms by which carbon dioxide affects development may help us understand the often variable effects of carbon dioxide upon plants.

Comparing the average responses of individual plants within the populations, elevated CO2 had no significant effects on architectural parameters that improve a plant's ability to forage for and acquire soil resources. In contrast, the intensity and magnitude of mycorrhizal colonization, and whole plant C/N ratios were significantly enhanced with elevated CO2. 3. The allometric scaling relationship between total plant biomass and root biomass was not affected by CO2, suggesting that relative allocation between roots and shoots was not affected. However, the allometric scaling relationships between root architectural parameters and plant biomass, and between fine root biomass and woody root biomass were significantly altered by elevated CO2. For all of these relationships, elevated CO2 reduced the 'size bias' of architectural components in relation to plant size within the populations; in elevated CO2 root architectural size (e.g. root length) per unit biomass was more similar between the smallest and largest individuals within the population than was the case for ambient CO2. 4. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the average individual seedling biomass and architectural growth responses within populations of plants exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels may be unresponsive, but that mycorrhizal responses and interactions among plants within populations may be altered significantly. These findings have important implications for how we make predictions about plant growth responses to elevated CO2 in natural ecosystems. Significant increases in mycorrhizal infection rates and architecture-biomass allometries suggest that below-ground competitive interactions within plant populations may be reduced in elevated CO2. Alterations in competitive interactions may lead to shifts in productivity and plant population structure.2199^3^Bettarini,I^Vaccari,FP^Miglietta,F^1998^1^Elevated CO2 concentrations and stomatal density: observations from 17 plant species growing in a CO2 spring in central Italy^127^4^1^17-22^^^^^Jan^^^^^71601030^312^344^348^374^384^465^634^705^73^. 4.

This study was conducted on 17 species growing in a naturally enriched CO2 spring and belonging to three plant communities. Stomatal conductance, stomatal density and stomatal index (SI) of plants from the spring, which were assumed to have been exposed for generations to elevated [CO2], and of plants of the same species collected in a nearby control site, were compared. Stomatal conductance was significantly lower in most of the species collected in the CO2 spring and this indicated that CO2 effects on g, are not of a transitory nature but persist in the long term and through plant generations. Such a decrease was, however, not associated with changes in the anatomy of leaves: SD was unaffected in the majority of species (the decrease was only significant in three out of the 17 species examined), and also SI values did not vary between the two sites with the exception of two species that showed increased SI in plants grown in the CO2-enriched area.

This exposure resulted in a reduction in leaf nitrogen, an increase in the C/N ratio and lower concentrations of oxalate in the leaves than in ambient air (350 ppm). Despite these changes in food quality, the effect of elevated CO2 on larvae of Gastrophysa viridula over three generations was minimal. However, the effect of CO2 did differ slightly between the generations of the insect. For the first generation, the results obtained were different from many of the published results in that elevated CO2 had no measurable effects on performance, except that third instar larvae showed compensatory feeding. Food quality, including leaf nitrogen content, declined over time in material grown in both ambient and elevated CO2. The results obtained for the second generation were similar to the first except that first instar larvae showed reduced relative growth rate in elevated CO2. Development time from hatching to pupation decreased over each generation, probably as a result of increasing temperatures. Measurements of adult performance showed that fecundity at the end of the second generation was reduced relative to the first, in line with the reduction in food quality. In addition at the end of the second generation, but not at the end of the first generation, adult females in elevated CO2 laid 30% fewer eggs per day and the eggs laid were 15% lighter than those in ambient conditions. These lighter eggs, coupled with no effect of elevated CO2 on growth during the third generation, meant that the larvae were consistently smaller in elevated CO2 during this generation.

A 3 degrees C temperature rise reduced leaf nutritional quality, by reducing foliar nitrogen concentration and increasing condensed tannin content. Doubling atmospheric CO2 temporarily increased total phenolics, but also reduced leaf toughness.

An optimization model is developed to examined effects of changes in the organization of photosynthetic components on leaf photosynthesis under various growth temperatures where the photosynthetic apparatus is not damaged. In this model, photosynthetic rate is limited either by the capacity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) to consume ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), or by the capacity of RuBP regeneration. For temperature dependence of the RuBPCase activity, data from Spinacia oleracea L., which have a temperature optimum of 30 degrees C, are used. For temperature dependence of the capacity of RuBP regeneration, two contrasting curves that have temperature optima of 30 degrees C (Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb. ex Spreng) and 40 degrees C (Larrea divaricata Cav.) are applied. The temperature dependence of each process is fixed for respective species, but the rate of each process varies with changes in the amounts of components. The cost of proteins, in terms of nitrogen, required to carry out each process is calculated when nitrogen is partitioned differently among photosynthetic components. The optimal nitrogen partitioning that maximizes daily photosynthesis at a given temperature is obtained. The predicted temperature optimum of the photosynthetic rate in Larrea divaricata exhibits large shifts with changes in target temperature, while shifts are negligible in Eucalyptus pauciflora. It is suggested that the shift in temperature optimum of photosynthetic rate is large when the temperature dependences of the capacities of RuBPCase and RuBP regeneration differ from each other.

Decomposition was followed using short-term rates of CO2 evolution, the amounts of C-13 and N-15 remaining were determined by mass spectrometry, and C-13 and N-15 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize chemically the plant material as it decomposed. After 224 days 48% of the added C-13 had been lost with a rapid period of CO2 evolution over the first 56 days. The fraction of cross- polarization magic angle spinning (CP MAS) C-13 NMR spectra represented by O-alkyl-C signal probably in carbohydrates (chemical shift, 60-90 p.p.m.) declined from 60 to 20% of the spectrum (chemical shift, 0-200 p.p.m.) over 224 days. The rate of decline of the total C-13 exceeded that of the 60-90 p.p.m. signal during the first 56 days and was similar thereafter. The fraction of the CP MAS C-13 NMR spectra represented by the alkyl- and methyl-C (chemical shift, 10-45 p.p.m.) signal increased from 5 to 14% over the first 14 days and was 19% after 224 days. CP MAS C-13 NMR of C-13- and N-15-L. perenne contained in 100-mu m aperture mesh bags incubated in the soil for 56 days indicated that the remaining material was mainly carbohydrate but there was an increase in the alkyl-and methyl- C associated with the bag's contents. After 224 days incubation of the labelled C-13- and N-15-L. perenne mixed with the soil, 40% of the added N-15 had been lost. Throughout the incubation there was only one signal centred around 100 p.p.m, detectable in the CP MAS N-15 NMR spectra. This signal corresponded to amide N-15 in peptides and may have been of plant or microbial origin or both. Although there had been substantial interaction between the added N-15 and the soil microorganisms, the associated redistribution of N-15 from plant to microbial tissues occurred within the amide region.

External CA activity was reduced when cultures were bubbled with air and was completely repressed when they were grown on 5% CO2.

The vertical distribution of needle nitrogen concentration was measured simultaneously with gas exchange of attached shoots. Based on the measurements, the dependencies on needle nitrogen concentrations of four photosynthetic parameters, i.e., RuP2 (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate)-saturated rate of carboxylation (V- cmax), maximum potential electron transport (J(max)), the rate of respiration in the light (R-d) and light-use-efficiency factor (delta), were determined. Using a crown multilayer model, the performance of daily crown photosynthesis in Scots pine was predicted. Compared to the control treatment, the mean concentration of nitrogen in the foliage decreased by 20% and by 17% for trees grown under Elev. C and under Elev. C + T, respectively, but increased by 4% for trees grown under Elev. T. However, the total content of foliage nitrogen per unit ground area increased by 25% for trees grown under Elev. C, by 19% for trees grown under Elev. C + T and by 6% for trees grown under Elev. T; these were due to the increase in the total needle area index. Regressions showed that the foliage grown under Elev. C and Elev. C + T had steeper slopes representing the responses of V-cmax, and R-d and delta to leaf nitrogen concentrations, while Elev. C + T and Elev. T had steeper slopes representing the response of J(max) to needle nitrogen concentrations. Predictions showed that, on a typical sunny day, the daily total of crown photosynthesis increased 22% and 27%, separately for Elev. C and Elev. C + T, and by only 9% for Elev. T alone. Furthermore, the increased daily crown photosynthesis, resulting from treatments involving elevated CO2, can be attributed mainly to an increase in the ambient CO2 concentration and the needle area index, while modification of the intrinsic photosynthetic capacity had only a marginal effect. Based on the current pattern of crown nitrogen allocation, the prediction showed also that the relationship between daily crown photosynthesis and crown nitrogen content was strongly dependent on the daily incident PAR and air temperature. The CO2-elevated treatments led to an increase in the sensitivity of daily crown photosynthesis to changes in crown nitrogen content, daily incident PAR and temperature, while the temperature-elevated treatment had the opposite effect on the sensitivity.

However, in natural ecosystems, plants are subject to a range of feedback effects that can interact with increased photosynthetic carbon gain in different ways so that it is not clear to what extent increased photosynthesis will translate into increased growth. To assess the probable growth response of nutrient-limited forests to increasing CO2 concentration, we use a previously developed modelling framework and apply it under conditions where the supply of nutrients is affected by a range of different factors. Our analysis indicates that forest growth is likely to be highly stimulated by increasing CO2 concentration in forests with high fertility, in forests with nitrogen fixing plants, in those subject to fire or where nitrogen in wood is effectively removed from the biologically active cycle either through physical removal of stems in harvesting or through continued stem growth over long time periods. Forest growth is likely to be stimulated by CO2 concentration in both phosphorus-and sulphur-limited forests provided nutrients in heartwood of trees are removed from the active nutrient cycle. Without this removal from the cycling system, however, sulphur-limited forests should show little response to increasing CO2. In phosphorus-limited forests without phosphorus removal, the response to increasing CO2 depends further on the equilibration state of the large pool of unavailable secondary phosphorus. Considered over periods of centuries during which the secondary pool has equilibrated, growth of phosphorus-limited forests is likely to be only weakly stimulated by increasing CO2 concentration. However, over shorter periods, increasing CO2 concentration should lead to a substantial increase in productivity. In general, it can be concluded that systems that are more open with respect to nutrient gains and losses are likely to be more responsive to increasing CO2 concentration than systems where the amount of available nutrients is less variable. In more open systems, operation at a lower internal nutrient concentration as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration can lead to reduced nutrient losses per unit carbon gain. Our analysis shows that the effect of increasing CO2 on forest growth can differ substantially between forests due to interactions with a range of factors that affect nutrient supply. The response of a particular forest to increasing CO2 concentration can only be predicted if the main factors controlling nutrient supply and growth in that forest are understood and incorporated into an assessment.2212^6^Klironomos,JN^Rillig,MC^Allen,MF^Zak,DR^Kubiske,M^Pregitzer,KS^1997^1^Soil fungal-arthropod responses to Populus tremuloides grown under enriched atmospheric CO2 under field conditions^127^3^6^473-478^^^^^Dec^^^^^71851096^1334^137^1981^1983^312^372^547^57^672^o nutrient gains and losses are likely to be more responsive to increasing CO2 concentration than systems where the amount of aA^7184^We investigated the influence of elevated CO2 and soil N availability on the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal and non- mycorrhizal fungi, and on the number of mycophagous soil microarthropods associated with the roots of Populus tremuloides.

With an increase in CO2 in the culture environment to 10% (v/v) at low light, the apparent photoautotrophic fixation of CO2 by Rubisco declined, whereas the non-photoautotrophic CO2 fixation by PEPC activity was enhanced. Hence, photosynthesis appears to play a lesser role in providing carbon skeletons and energy with prolonged culture in a CO2-enriched environment. Instead, the anaplerotic supply of C-skeletons by PEPC may be important under such a situation. Short-term (HCO3-)-C-14 fixation experiments indicated that photoautotrophic callus cultured for 3 weeks with 10% CO2 enrichment assimilated less (CO2)-C-14 than the control (0.03% CO2).

Despite the changes in the in vitro Rubisco/PEPC activity-ratio, no significant change in the C-14 distribution pattern was apparent in response to increasing sucrose or CO2 concentrations. The suppression of Rubisco activity and total chlorophyll content in high sucrose or elevated CO2 concentrations suggests an inhibition of the capacity for photoautotrophic callus growth under these conditions.2214^5^Luo,Y^Chen,JL^Reynolds,JF^Field,CB^Mooney,HA^1997^1^Disproportional increases in photosynthesis and plant biomass in a Californian grassland exposed to elevated CO2: a simulation analysis^43^11^6^696-704^^^^^Dec^^^^^7189310^374^376^672^699^783^791^92^a situation.

Elevated CO2 concentrations often lead to increased photosynthetic carbon uptake in plants, but this does nor necessarily result in a proportional increase in plant biomass. We examined this paradox for grasslands in northern California that have been exposed to elevated CO2 since 1992. We evaluated the effects of physiological adjustments on plant growth and carbon balance of the dominant species, Avena barbata, using a plant growth model. 2. Without physiological adjustments, an observed 70% increase in leaf photosynthesis in elevated CO2 was predicted to increase plant biomass by 97% whereas experimental measurements suggested 5 and 13% decreases in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and a 40% increase in 1994. 3. Simulations with an increase in carbon allocation to roots by 29%, or leaf death rate by 80%, or non-structural carbohydrate storage by 60%, or leaf mass per unit area by 25% each predicted an approximately 40% increase in plant biomass in 1994 under elevated CO2. It follows that greater suppression of the biomass responses to elevated CO2, in 1992 and 1993 resulted from variable combinations of these physiological adjustments. 4. This modelling study concludes that (a) an increase in carbon loss or (b) a decrease in carbon-use efficiency or (c) an increase in carbon allocation to root growth will result in an increase in biomass growth that is less than that in leaf photosynthesis under elevated CO2. Alternatively, if carbon loss is reduced (e.g, depressed respiration) and/or carbon allocation to leaf growth is increased, biomass growth may be stimulated more than leaf photosynthesis by atmospheric CO2 concentration. Moreover, this modelling exercise suggests that physiological adjustments may have substantial effects on ecosystem carbon processes by varying ecosystem carbon influx, litterfall and Litter quality.l carbohydrate storage by 60%, or leaf mass per unit area by 25% each predicted an approximately 40% increase in plant biomass in 1994 under elevated CO2.

Intact monoliths were taken from an old-field and put, during a six month growing season, into growth chambers in which external climatic conditions were mimicked and [CO2] was regulated. Fruit set time was significantly changed in six species under elevated [CO2] and leaf and branch senescence accelerated in most species. Grasses had fewer leaves and legumes were more branched at peak production under elevated [CO2] than under ambient. Plant seed number was not significantly changed under elevated [CO2], whereas the reproductive effort of grasses was significantly depressed. Reproductive and vegetative characteristics showed related responses to [CO2], as species with enhanced biomass had a hastened fruit set time, a higher number of fruits per plant and a higher reproductive biomass under elevated [CO2] than under ambient conditions, while species with depressed biomass had a delayed fruit set time, a lower number of fruits per plant and a lower reproductive biomass.

Two important but not well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2 leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil. We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes to regenerate. We used N-15 pool dilution techniques to quantify nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms. These changes included increases in total plant biomass production, plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots, changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4+ uptake rates, gross NH4+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4+ consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced plant NH4+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4+ availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4+ mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) incre2217^3^Cruz,C^Lips,SH^Martins-Loucao,MA^1997^1^Changes in the morphology of roots and leaves of carob seedlings induced by nitrogen source and atmospheric carbon dioxide^52^80^6^817-823^^^^^Dec^^^^^71952231^243^3174^3250^349^372^374^417^433^92^erm growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases.

One of two nitrogen sources, nitrate or ammonium, was added to the nutrient medium at concentrations of 3 mol m(-3). Root systems of the developing plants supplied with nitrate compared to those supplied with ammonium were characterized by: (a) more biomass on the lower part of the root; (b) fewer lateral roots of first and second order; (c) longer roots; (d) higher specific root length; (e) a smaller root diameter. The morphology of the root systems of nitrate- fed plants changed in the presence of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, resembling, more closely, that of ammonium-fed plants. Total leaf area was higher in ammonium-than in nitrate- fed plants. Nitrate-fed plants had greater total leaf area in the presence of high carbon dioxide than in normal CO2, due to an increase in epidermal cell size that led to development of larger leaflets with lower stomatal frequency. The observed changes in the morphology of roots and shoots agreed with the results observed for total biomass production. Nitrate-fed plants increased their biomass production by 100% in the presence of elevated CO2 compared to 15% in ammonium-fed plants, indicating that the response of carob to high CO2 concentrations is very dependent on the nitrogen source. Under elevated CO2, nitrate grown plants had a larger content of sucrose in both roots and shoots, while no significant difference was observed in the content of sucrose in ammonium- grown plants, whether in ambient or enriched carbon dioxide. Hence, the differences in soluble carbohydrate contents can, at least partly, account for differences in root and shoot morphology.

Seedlings were grown for 138 days at two CO2 partial pressures (35 and 70 Pa CO2) and four N solution concentrations (0.5, 1.5, 3.5, and 6.5 mmol l(-1) NO3NH4) and concentrations of total phenolics and condensed tannins were determined four times during plant development in primary and fascicular needles, stems and lateral and tap roots. Concentrations of total phenolics in lateral roots and condensed tannins in tap roots were relatively high regardless of treatment. In the smallest seedlings secondary compound concentrations were relatively high and decreased in the initial growth phase. Thereafter condensed tannins accumulated strongly during plant maturation in all plant parts except in lateral roots, where concentrations did not change. Concentrations of total phenolics continued to decrease in lateral roots while they remained constant in all other plant parts. At the final harvest plants grown at elevated CO2 or low N availability showed increased concentrations of condensed tannins in aboveground parts. The CO2 effect, however, disappeared when size differences were adjusted for, indicating that CO2 only indirectly affected concentrations of condensed tannins through accelerating growth. Concentrations of total phenolics increased directly in response to low N availability and elevated CO2 in primary and fascicular needles and in lateral roots, which is consistent with predictions of the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis. The CNB hypothesis is also supported by the strong positive correlations between soluble sugar and total phenolics and between starch and condensed tannins. The results suggest that predictions of the CNB hypothesis could be improved if developmentally induced changes of secondary compounds were included.ange.

CA^7198^Ecosystem-level experiments on the effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment and N deposition on forest trees are urgently needed. Here we present data for nine model ecosystems of spruce (Picea abies) on natural nutrient-poor montane forest soil (0.7 m(2) of ground and 350 kg weight). Each system was composed of six 7-year-old (at harvest) trees each representing a different genotype, and a herbaceous understory layer (three species). The model ecosystems were exposed to three different CO2 concentrations (280, 420, 560 mu l l(-1)) and three different rates of wet N deposition (0, 30, 90 kg ha(-1) year(- 1)) in a simulated annual course of Swiss montane climate for 3 years. The total ecosystem biomass was not affected by CO2 concentration, but increased with increasing N deposition. However, biomass allocation to roots increased with increasing CO2 leading to significantly lower leaf mass ratios (LMRs) and leaf area ratios (LARs) in trees grown at elevated CO2. In contrast to CO2 enrichment, N deposition increased biomass allocation to the aboveground plant parts, and thus LMR and LAR were higher with increasing N deposition. We observed no CO2 x N interactions on growth, biomass production, or allocation, and there were also no genotype x treatment interactions. The final leaf area index (LAI) of the spruce canopies was 19% smaller at 420 and 27% smaller at 560 than that measured at 280 mu l CO2 l(-1), but was not significantly altered by increasing N deposition. Lower LAIs at elevated CO2 largely resulted from shorter branches (less needles per individual tree) and partially from increased needle litterfall. Independently of N deposition, total aboveground N content in the spruce communities declined with increasing CO2 (-18% at 420 and -31% at 560 compared to 280 mu l CO2 l(-1)). N deposition had the opposite effect on total above ground N content (+18% at 30 and +52% at 90 compared to 0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Our results suggest that under competitive conditions on natural forest soil, atmospheric CO2 enrichment may not lead to higher ecosystem biomass production, but N deposition is likely to do so. The reduction in LAI under elevated CO2 suggests allometric down-regulation of photosynthetic carbon uptake at the canopy level. The strong decline in the tree nitrogen mass per unit ground area in response to elevated CO2 may indicate CO2- induced reductions of soil N availability.2220^3^Luscher,A^Hendrey,GR^Nosberger,J^1998^1^Long-term responsiveness to free air CO2 enrichment of functional types, species and genotypes of plants from fertile permanent grassland^2^113^1^37-45^^^^^Jan^^^^^72011239^1292^130^1777^374^398^507^57^792^92^ition, total aboveground N content in the spruce communities declined with increasing CO2 (-18% at 420 and -31% at 560 compared to 280 mu l CO2 l(-1)).

The plant species were grouped according to their functional types: grasses (L. perenne, L. multiflorum, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus, Trisetum flavescens), non-legume dicots (Rumex obtusifolius, R. acetosa, Ranunculus friesianus), and legumes (Trifolium repens, T. pratense). Yield (above a cutting height of 4.5 cm) was measured three times per year. The results were as follow. (1) There were highly significant differences in the responsiveness to elevated pCO(2) between the three functional types; legumes showed the strongest and grasses the weakest yield increase at elevated pCO(2). (2) There were differences in the temporal development of responsiveness to elevated pCO(2) among the functional types. The responsiveness of the legumes declined from the first to the second year, while the responsiveness of the non-legume dicots increased over the 3 years. During the growing season, the grasses and the non- legume dicots showed the strongest response to elevated pCO(2) during reproductive growth in the spring. (3) There were no significant genotypic differences in responsiveness to elevated pCO(2). Our results suggest that, due to interspecific differences in the responsiveness to elevated pCO(2), the species proportion within fertile temperate grassland may change if the increase in pCO(2) continues. Due to the temporal differences in the responsiveness to elevated pCO(2) among species, complex effects of elevated pCO(2) on competitive interactions in mixed swards must be expected.

The selection of a full dwarf wheat (less than 30 cm tall) with high photosynthetic and yield potential is a necessary prerequisite for growing wheat in the controlled, volume- limited environments available aboard long-term spaceflight missions. This study evaluated the photosynthetic capacity and carbon partitioning of a full-dwarf wheat cultivar, Super Dwarf, which is routinely used in spaceflight studies aboard U.S. space shuttle and NASA/Mir missions and made comparisons with other dwarf and semidwarf wheat cultivars utilized in other ground-based studies in plant space biology. Photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf in two dwarf (Super Dwarf, BB-19), and three semi-dwarf (Veery-10, Yecora Rojo, IBWSN 199) wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) was assessed by measuring: net maximum photosynthet ic rate, RuBP carboxylation efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and flag leaf area. Dry mass partitioning of carbohydrates to the leaves, sheaths, stems and ear was also assessed.

Photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf was determined at anthesis using net CO2 exchange rate versus internal CO2 concentration curves measured under saturating light (2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and CO2 (1000 mu mol mol(-1)).

The reduced- height wheat had significantly less dry mass fraction in the stem but greater dry mass partitioned to the ear than the taller semi-dwarfs (Yecora rojo, IBWSN-199).

Two constant day/night temperature regimes with a difference of 4 degrees C (30/20 and 26/16.5 degrees C) were used throughout the growing season in combination with two light intensities (75 and 52.5 W m(-2)). The results showed that significant interactions occurred for most of the characters studied. Although the development of leaf area was mainly temperature-dependent, plants at harvest had a larger leaf area when high temperature was combined with low rather than with high light intensity. Leaf area was least in the low temperature-low light regime. However, the plants grown under the high temperature-low light combination weighed the least. Variations in the number of nodes and internode length were largely dependent on temperature rather than light. Light did, however, affect the numbers of branches, sympodia and monopodia. The first two of these were highest in the high light-high temperature regime and the third in the low light- low temperature regime. All other characters, except time to certain developmental stages and fibre length, were reduced at the lower light intensity. Variation in temperature modified the light effect and vice versa, in a character-dependent manner. More specifically, square and boil dry weights, as well as seed cotton yield per plant, were highest in high light combined with low temperature, where the most and heaviest bells were produced. But flower production was favoured by high light and high temperature, suggesting increased boil retention at low temperature, especially when combined with low light. Low temperature and high light also maximized lint percentage. Fibres were shortest in the high temperature-high light regime, where fibre strength, micronaire index and maturity ratio were at a maximum.

Simulated key processes are light utilization, leaf formation, leaf elongation, tillering, and carbon partitioning (storage, shoot, root). Source- and sink-limited growth are simulated independently. Sink-limited growth is characterized by temperature-dependent leaf expansion and tiller development, whereas source-limited growth is determined by photosynthetic light-use-efficiency of the canopy and the remobilization of stored carbohydrates in the stubble. At each integration step, commonly 1 day, the available amount of carbon from the source is compared with the carbon required by the sink. The actual growth is determined by the minimum value of either the sink or the source. If the source is in excess of the sink, the surplus is allocated to storage carbohydrates in the stubble. This storage carbon is available for remobilization at times that the sink requires more carbohydrates than are available from photosynthesis. In contrast to previous grassland models, LINGRA describes regrowth after defoliation in a mechanistic way, balanced by temperature-driven remobilization of stored carbohydrates. In order to validate LINGRA, an extensive set of experimental data was used, derived from measurements at 35 sites in Europe. The average error between the observed and predicted yields was 14% at the level of irrigated, and 19% at the level of non-irrigated, treatments for the whole of Europe.

Their responses to CO2 concentrations of 350, 450, 550, 650 and 750 vpm and temperatures of 12, 13.5, 15, 16.5 and 18 degrees C were examined by using a fractional factorial design for the two treatment factors. Use of the daylit cabinets allowed the plants to be grown in natural light, common atmospheric humidities (vpd 0.7 kPa) and nonlimiting supplies of water and mineral nutrients. Polynomial models were used to summarize the whole plant dry weight and fresh weight yield responses and to indicate the potential impact of climate change. Additionally, the models were used to generate predictions of the percentage change in whole plant dry weight and plant fresh weight yield for the years 2025 and 2050 relative to 1992. Baseline values of 350 vpm for CO2 and a mean temperature of 13.5 degrees C for 1992 together with forecast CO2 values of 407 and 442 vpm and temperature increases of 0.7 and 1.1 C for 2025 and 2050 respectively were used. For 2025, fresh weight yield changes of + 19%, +9% and +13% were obtained for beetroot, carrot and onion crops respectively, while for 2050 the respective changes were + 32 %, + 13 % and +21 %. Measurements of the ratio of the maximum diameter of the bulb to the minimum diameter of the neck for onions showed that there was little or no influence of CO2, whereas the effect of temperature was substantial. Bulbing was accelerated by high temperature and was greatly delayed at low temperature. At temperatures < 15 degrees C, the delays to bulbing resulted in the development of undesirable, thick-necked onions which tended to remain green with erect leaves.

Although atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2](a), also increased during that time period, and although crop growth and yield can respond positively to [CO2](a) increase, yield increases were due mainly to factors other than increasing [CO2](a). Similarly, some yield increases prior to 1900 were also associated primarily with factors other than changes in [CO2](a). In particular, past national average yield increases were the result chiefly of technological advances such as nitrogen fertilization; selection of genotypes with increased harvest index and disease resistance; mechanization of planting, cultivation, and harvesting; and chemical weed and pest control. If technology continues to increase average yields at recent rates, near-future increases in [CO2](a) will have only small impacts on yield in comparison to technology in many countries. Conversely, if future increases in [CO2](a) are the main drivers of future yield increases, those yield increases will be small. These points are demonstrated through a comparison of (i) long-term records of yield, (ii) data from key controlled-[CO2] experiments, and (iii) records of past [CO2](a). Finally, it is noted that continued [CO2](a) increase may bring with it climatic changes that could have negative or positive impacts on future yield. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two different silvicultural systems were studied: high forest and coppice- with-standards, We studied separately effects related to the age of the tree at the time the ring was formed and effects attributable to environmental changes. At young ages, delta(13)C shows an increase of more than 1 parts per thousand. However, age-related trends differ in high forest and coppice- with-standards. Changes in microenvironmental variables during stand maturation, and physiological changes related to structural development of the trees with ageing, could explain these results. During the past century, delta(13)C in tree rings shows a pattern of decline that is not paralleled by air delta(13)C changes. Isotopic discrimination has significantly decreased from 18.1 to 16.4 parts per thousand in high forest and varied insignificantly between 17.4 and 16.9 parts per thousand in coppice-with-standards, As a consequence, intrinsic water-use efficiency has increased by 44% in high forest and 23% in coppice-with-standards during the past century.

However other environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition, may be responsible for such trends.2232^4^Luxmoore,RJ^Hanson,PJ^Beauchamp,JJ^Joslin,JD^1998^1^Passive nighttime warming facility for forest ecosystem research^13^18^8-9^615-623^^^^^Aug-Sep^^^^^7225137^310^312^3263^3264^3265^349^811^92^976^physiological changes related to structural development of the trees with ageing, could explain these results.

Over the last four decades a significant rise in nighttime mini mum temperature has been determined from analysis of meteorological records from a global distribution of locations. The experiment involves nighttime deployment of infrared (IR) reflecting curtains around four sides of a forest canopy and across the top of the forest to mimic the top-down warming effect of cloud cover. The curtains are deployed with cable and pulley systems mounted on a tower and scaffolding structure built around the selected forest site. The trunk space is not enclosed except as an optional manipulation. The curtains reflect long-wave radiation emitted from the forest and ground back into the forest warming the trees, litter, and soil. Excellent infrared reflection can be obtained with commercially available fabrics that have aluminum foil bonded to one side. A canopy warming of 3 to 5 degrees C is expected on cloudless nights, and on cloudy nights, a warming of 1 to 3 degrees C is anticipated relative to a control plot. The curtains are withdrawn by computer control during the day and also at night during periods with precipitation or excessive wind. Examples of hypothesized ecosystem responses to nighttime warming include: (1) increase in tree maintenance respiration (decreasing carbon reserves and ultimately tree growth), (2) increase in the length of the growing season (increasing growth), (3) increase in soil respiration, (4) increase in litter decomposition, (5) increase in mineralization of N and other nutrients from soil organic matter, (6) increase in nutrient uptake (increasing growth), and (7) increase in N immobilization in litter. Hypothesis 1 has the opposite consequence for tree growth to Hypotheses 2 and 6, and thus opposite consequences for the feedback regulation that vegetation has on net greenhouse gas releases to the atmosphere. If Hypothesis 1 is dominant, warming could lead to more warming from the additional CO2 emissions. Site- specific meteorological, ecophysiological. and phenological measurements are obtained in the warming treatment and in a carefully selected control plot to investigate site-specific hypotheses, Measurements made on both plots for a baseline period and during the period of curtain deployment provide data to test the hypotheses statistically by the "before-after- control-impact" method applicable to unreplicated experiments. The enclosure has a modular design that can be adapted and combined with other forest-scale manipulation experiments such as free air CO2 enrichment and throughfall displacement.2233^6^Bender,J^Hertstein,U^Fangmeier,A^van Oijen,M^Weigel,HJ^Jager,HJ^1998^1^The impact of climate change on yield of wheat in Europe: Results of the European stress physiology and climate experiment (ESPACE-wheat)^292^72^1-2^37-42^^^^^May^^^^^72271190^1262^1364^174^264^312^447^92^eleases to the atmosphere.

Major goals of the project were 1) to investigate by means of experiments the sensitivity of wheat growth, development and productivity to the combined effects of changes in CO2 concentration, climatic variables and other physiological stresses, 2) to use experimental data for extension and improvement of process- based wheat growth simulation models, and 3) to apply models to assess the influences on crops of climatic change, CO2 concentration and additional stresses in Europe. Experimental studies were performed at different sites in Europe through three consecutive seasons by means of open-top chambers according to a common standard protocol, and two simulation models were used for the analysis: AFRCWHEAT2 and LINTULCC. This paper summarizes the main findings of the effects of CO2 enrichment and other factors such as ozone, drought stress or nitrogen supply on the yield response of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Minaret). A comparison of the measured data with the main outputs of the LINTULCC model simulations is are presented. Generally, Minaret wheat did not respond significantly to ozone. CO2 enrichment had a positive influence on grain yield in almost all experiments, however, significant interactions between CO2 and other factors were not common. The average measured yield increase due to CO2 doubling was 35 % compared to grain yield measured at ambient CO2 concentrations, although there was a great variability in yield responses between sites and years. LINTULCC predicted a 42 % yield increase, but a much smaller variation between individual experiments. Although the effects of CO2 and O-2 on crop growth and yield were acceptably simulated, observed process-rates often showed variation not related to light intensity, temperature, CO2 or O-2, ie, not related to the main driving variables of the models.

Influences of source-sink balance on leaf area, leaf dry weight, LMA, and leaf content in non-structural carbohydrates were investigated in glasshouse tomato crops. The source-sink balance was manipulated by artificial shading, CO2 enrichment or fruit removal using different tomato cultivars. Leaf area was hardly affected by competition for assimilates except under extreme conditions. Iri contrast, leaf dry weight, and consequently LMA, underwent large and rapid fluctuations in response to any factor that changed source and sink activities. A 60% reduction of photosynthetically active radiation involved a 24% decrease in LMA after 10 d. Carbon dioxide enrichment and fruit removal induced about a 45% and 15% increase in LMA, respectively, on plants with two fruiting trusses, but hardly affected LMA of producing plants. No significant cultivar effect could be identified. Changes in starch and soluble sugar content in leaves accounted for only 29% of diurnal variations in LMA, suggesting regular fluctuations of other components. We propose that structural LMA varies between a maximum and a minimum value according to the ratio of assimilate supply and demand during leaf development. Leaf area is independent of the supply of assimilates when the minimum structural LMA is realised. When the maximum structural LMA is attained, a storage pool of assimilates may accumulate in leaves during periods of high supply and low demand. We present a model including these hypotheses, which predicts structural and non- structural LMA variations of plants with different source-sink ratios.

No sigA^7236^Most model-based predictions of climate change effects on forest ecosystems have used either potential or static descriptions of vegetation and site, removing the effects of direct management or land use. In this paper we use a previously developed and validated model of carbon and water balances in forest ecosystems (PnET-II) to assess the relative sensitivity of forest production in Ireland to predicted climate change and to ambient variability in site quality. After validating the model against measured productivity for 2 sets of stands, we ran the model using existing variation in site quality, represented as differences in foliar N concentration, and also for predicted changes in climate and atmospheric CO2. Resulting variations in productivity were compared with those due to potential errors in the specification of input parameters and to variation in current ambient climate across the region. The effects on net primary production (NPP) and wood production of either ambient variation in climate or predicted changes in temperature, precipitation and CO2 are quite small (0 to 30%) relative to the effects of ambient variability in site quality (up to 400%). The range of possible variation in other user-specified physiological parameters resulted in changes of less than 10% in model predictions. We conclude that site-specific conditions and management practices result in a range of forest productivity that is much greater than any likely to be induced by climate change or CO2 enrichment. We also suggest that it is essential to understand and map spatial variability in site quality, as well as to understand how the productive capacity of landscapes will change in response to management and pollution loading, if we are to predict the actual role that climate change will play in altering forest productivity and global biogeochemistry.2239^1^Grant,RF^1998^1^Simulation in ecosys of root growth response to contrasting soil water and nitrogen^81^107^2-3^237-264^^^^^1 Apr^^^^^7239bient variation in climate 1069^1285^224^312^314^3270^3271^417^724^986^ation and CO2 are quite small (0 to 30%) relative to the effects of ambient variability in site quality (up to 400%).

A mathematical model of root and mycorrhizal growth is proposed to represent the effects of soil and climate on growth using the hypothesis that a functional equilibrium exists among root axes and shoot branches. In this model access to growth resources (C, N, P, water) by different axes or branches depends upon (1) proximity of the axis or branch to the point of resource acquisition, and (2) the rate at which resources are consumed by the axis or branch in relation to that by other axes or branches. This model was coupled to a plant growth model as part of the ecosystem simulation model ecosys, and its sensitivity to changes in model parameters and soil boundary conditions was tested. Simulated root growth was less sensitive to changes in soil water and nitrogen than was simulated shoot growth. This lower sensitivity allowed the model to simulate changes in root,shoot ratios with changes in soil water and nitrogen that were consistent with those commonly reported in the literature. Changes in soil water also caused changes in vertical distributions of root length density to be simulated that were also consistent with those reported. Changes in root,shoot partitioning and in root density distributions allowed improved access by plants in the model to limiting growth resources. The root model was parameterized from basic root growth studies conducted independently of the model, and without reference to site-specific patterns of seasonal root growth. Consequently the model is likely to be of general value in the simulation of root growth under diverse soil conditions, although such generality needs to be established through further testing under different soils, climates and crops. The precision of some of the model parameters is uncertain and the sensitivity of the model to this uncertainty is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

These studies all suggest that a 300 to 600 ppm doubling of the atmosphere's CO2 concentration could raise the planet's mean surface air temperature by only about 0.4 degrees C. Even this modicum of warming may never be realized, however, for it could be negated by a number of planetary cooling forces that are intensified by warmer temperatures and by the strengthening of biological processes that are enhanced by the same rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration that drives the warming. Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air's CO2 content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.

Model- based optimization can achieve this balance, but requires reliable models of the greenhouse environment and of the crop response. This study assumes that the crop response is known, and focuses on the greenhouse model. Neural network greenhouse models were trained using data collected over two summer months in a small greenhouse. The models were reduced to minimum size, by predicting separately the temperature and CO2 concentration, and by eliminating any unessential input. The resulting models not only fit the data well, they also seem qualitatively correct, and produce reasonable optimization results. Using these models, the effect of evaporative cooling on extending the enrichment duration is demonstrated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

After the end of the growing season half of the cores were kept unnaturally warm (17-20 degrees C). The potential for CH4 production and oxidation was measured at the end of the emission experiment. 2 The vascular cores ('Sedge') consisted of a moss layer with sedges, and the moss cores ('Sphagnum') of Sphagnum mosses (some sedge seedlings were removed by cutting). Methane efflux was 6-12 times higher from the Sedge cores than from the Sphagnum cores. The release of CH4 from Sedge cores increased with increasing temperature of the peat and decreased with decreasing temperature. Methane efflux from Sphagnum cores was quite stable independent of the peat temperatures. 3 In both Sedge and Sphagnum samples, CO2 treatment doubled the potential CH4 production but had no effect on the potential CH4 oxidation. A raised concentration of CO2 increased CH4 efflux weakly and only at the highest peat temperatures (17-20 degrees C). 4 The results suggest that in cool regions, such as boreal wetlands, temperature would restrict decomposition of the extra substrates probably derived from enhanced primary production of mire vegetation under raised CO2 concentrations, and would thus retard any consequent increase in CH4 emission.2246^4^Tischler,CR^Polley,HW^Johnson,HB^Mayeux,HS^1998^1^Environment and seedling age influence mesquite response to epicotyl removal^319^51^3^361-365^^^^^May^^^^^72531531^3285^376^547^710^751^92^m the Sedge cores than from the Sphagnum cores.

Clipping below the cotyledons is lethal; removal of the epicotyl may not be lethal but can severely limit seedling growth. Seedlings of other woody species sometimes compensate for epicotyl removal by prolonging the life of cotyledons. Also, projected future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration could influence survival and growth after epicotyl removal. Objectives of this study were to determine effects of epicotyl removal at various seedling ages, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and soil fertility, on (1) seedling survival, (2) cotyledonary leaf longevity, and (3) shoot and root growth of young seedlings. Mesquite seedlings were grown at 350, 700, and 1,000 mu L liter(-1) atmospheric CO2 concentration in nutrient poor and nutrient rich soils. All ages of seedlings survived epicotyl removal. Cotyledonary leaf fresh mass and chlorophyll content were higher in plants where epicotyls were clipped. Root and shoot mass of both clipped and unclipped plants generally increased at higher CO2 concentrations when mineral nutrition was adequate, but responded less to CO2 when soil fertility was low. Responses to epicotyl clipping in mesquite seedlings are complex, being strongly influenced by soil fertility, atmospheric CO2 concentration, seedling age at clipping, and interactions between these factors.2247^1^Wellburn,AR^1998^1^Atmospheric nitrogenous compounds and ozone - is NOx fixation by plants a possible solution?^84^139^1^5-9^^^^^May^^^^^7255349^374^433^92^spheric CO2 concentrations, and soil fertility, on (1) seedling survival, (2) cotyledonary leaf longevity, and (3) shoot and root growth of young seedlings.

Improvements of plant tolerance towards O-3 are being investigated but very little work has been done to explore NOx tolerance and plant acclimation to NO2 and NO. However, it is clear that within the populations of some plant species there is wide variation, and some individuals can fix NOx, and use the nitrogen directly from the atmosphere, rather than rely upon, for example, root uptake of nitrate. It is possible that individuals capable of fixing NOx could be selected for a range of species, and genotypes with high rates of uptake could be of value as crops or for forestation in polluted areas (e.g. landscaping in the vicinity of motorways) to reduce tropospheric concentrations of NOx significantly and also to decrease the potential for O-3 production.2248^6^He,P^Bader,KP^Radunz,A^Kahmann,U^Ruppel,GH^Schmid,GH^1998^1^Gas exchange characteristics in leaves of the Euphorbiacea Aleurites montana as consequence of growth under 700 ppm CO2 in air - A study on photosynthesis and photorespiration in the Chinese tung-oil tree^291^53^3-4^151-158^^^^^Mar-Apr^^^^^72571531^188^3286^ery little work has been done to explore NOx tolerance and plant acclimation to NO2 and NO.

These plants, which grow substantially better in the CO2-enriched atmosphere, were analyzed by mass spectrometry for photosynthesis and photorespiration together with control plants grown all the lime in normal (350 ppm CO2) air. Thereafter part of the plants was subjected for two weeks to 0.3 ppm SO2 in the atmosphere and again analyzed for photosynthesis and photorespiration. Aleurites montana exhibits a strongly CO2-dependent photosynthesis which partially explains the observed stimulatory effect of 700 ppm CO2 on growth of the plant. In control plants grown in normal air, photorespiration measured simultaneously with photosynthesis via the uptake of O-18(2) in the light, is much lower than in C-3-plants like tobacco (He et at, 1995, Z. Naturforsch. 50c, 781-788). In Aleurites grown in 700 ppm CO2, however, photorespiration is completely absent in contrast to tobacco when grown under 700 ppm CO2. In tobacco, photorespiration is not inhibited to the extent of the in vitro experiments in which plants grown at 350 ppm CO2 are measured under the increased CO2 content of 700 ppm. Gas exchange measurements carried out by mass spectrometry show that the ratio of O-2 evolved to CO2 fixed is about 0.5. Apparently, part of the CO2 fixed is channelled into a metabolic path without concomitant O-2-evolution. Although the plant has no succulent appearance (its leaves somehow resemble maple leaves) apparently a Crassulacean type metabolism is performed. When Aleurites plants grown all the time in normal air with 350 ppm, are exposed for two weeks to 0.3 ppm SO2 the treatment completely inhibits this CO2-fixing portion which is tentatively attributed to a Crassulacean type of metabolism. This is demonstrated by a normal C-3-type ratio O-2 evolved/CO2 fixed of 1. When Aleurites plants, grown for 4 months in a CO2- enriched atmosphere of 700 ppm CO2, are subjected for two weeks to 0.3 ppm SO2, the features of control plants show up again. When these plants are tested under 350 ppm CO2 the Crassulacean type CO2-fixation apparently is not inhibited by SO2. Photorespiration, although low is present in the same activity as in the controls. Seemingly, an increased level of CO2 in air tends to alleviate the impact of the SO2 at least in the Chinese lung-oil tree.2249^2^Knapp,PA^Soule,PT^1998^1^Recent Juniperus occidentalis (western juniper) expansion on a protected site in central Oregon^127^4^3^347-357^^^^^Mar^^^^^7259227^312^3287^374^399^434^456^549^92^ormed.

In this study, we document changes in vegetation (including J. occidentalis) in central Oregon over a 23-year period and relate these changes to their probable causes. In June 1995 we returned to the Horse Ridge Research Natural Area (HRRNA), a site that has a history of minimal anthropogenic impacts, to replicate a 1972 vegetation survey. Using the canopy-intercept method, line intercept method, and aerial photography analysis to measure herbaceous cover, shrub cover and tree cover, respectively, we found significant changes had occurred in the 23-year period between studies. Relative changes of tree, shrub, and perennial herbaceous cover were 59%, 7%, and -38%, respectively. Relative increases in J. occidentalis density, as measured by the number of clumps and the number of stems, were 37% and 53%, respectively. Mean maximum height of J. occidentalis had increased by 10%. We examined the role of potentially confounding influences (e.g. fire, grazing, pathogens, climatic variability) and found that none of the traditional mechanisms implicated in J. occidentalis expansion adequately explained the observed changes. We suggest that the role of biological inertia of both anthropogenic and natural means may have had a profound effect on the J. occidentalis ecology of HRRNA.2250^2^Raddatz,RL^Shaykewich,CF^1998^1^Impact of warm summers on the actual evapotranspiration from spring wheat grown on the eastern Canadian prairies^82^78^1^171-179^^^^^Feb^^^^^72611285^3288^508^727^nd tree cover, respectively, we found significant changes had occurred in the 23-year period between studies.

The eastern Prairies is a semi-arid region where over 60% of the land is cultivated. Over a third of the cropped land is usually sown to spring wheat. A comparison of mean summer temperatures and modelled evapotranspiration, for the years 1988 to 1996, demonstrated that with the current environmental conditions and farming practices, warm summers have lower actual evapotranspiration totals from spring wheat than cool summers. The average daily actual evapotranspiration rate is generally higher in years with higher mean summer temperatures; however, the crop growth- period is shorter. The net effect is lower total actual evapotranspiration from spring wheat. This suggests that climate warming on the eastern Canadian Prairies, if the current trend continues and all other factors remain equal, will reduce, on average, the total actual evapotranspiration from spring wheat. A reduction in the growth-period actual evapotranspiration from lands sown to spring wheat will likely decrease the total actual evapotranspiration for the entire warm season as growth-period evapotranspiration currently makes up about three-quarters of the seasonal total. However, the magnitude and timing of the reduction is far from certain. The consequence for agriculture may be a reduction in the average spring wheat yield because yield is positively correlated with the actual evapotranspiration total from the crop.2251^4^Sagi,M^Dovrat,A^Kipnis,T^Lips,H^1998^1^Nitrate reductase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and glutamine synthetase in annual ryegrass as affected by salinity and nitrogen^166^21^4^707-723^^^^^^^^^^72631538^244^3289^361^386^427^439^618^639^92^piration from spring wheat.

Increasing salinity and N in the growth medium induced changes in the level of key enzymes of N assimilation and organic acids: nitrate reductase (NR, EC 1.6.6.1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc, EC 4.1.1.31), and glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2). Plants grown in pots filled with sand were irrigated with nutrient solutions with an electroconductivity of 2 or 11.2 dS m(-1) and N applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), or ammonium applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), or ammonium (NH4) as ammonium sulfate [(NH4)(2)SO4] at concentrations of 0.5, 4.5 or 9.0 mM. Nitrate reductase, PEPc, and GS increased with salinity and N level. Shoot NR was highest in the presence of NH4NO3 irrespective of salinity level, while root NR activity responded best to NO3. Enhancement of PEPc activity in both shoots and roots was highest with NH4NO3 and lowest with NH4. Nitrogen source had no significant effect on GS activity in shoots or roots of ryegrass. Shoot NR activity increased with NO3 concentration in the tissue, as calculated from repression coefficients. The PEPc activity correlated positively with total cations and NO3 concentrations in the plants, irrespective of the salinity level, suggesting that the increase in total cations and NO3 induced by salinity may have triggered the changes in enzyme activities. The concentration of organic acids in both shoots and roots correlated positively with PEPc activity irrespectively of the salinity level. The PEPc activity was higher in roots than in shoots, while organic acid concentration was higher in shoots. These results suggest that a significant part of the organic acids produced in the roots were used as carbon skeleton for transamination reactions. The increased activity of NR, PEPc, and GS in roots may constitute part of an adaptation strategy of the plant to increasing salinity in the medium. These enzymes have an important role in the metabolism of amino acids and the synthesis of organic N in annual ryegrass irrigated with saline water, and boosting them with suitable N fertilizers could increase the nutritional value and protein content of the crop.2252^5^Signora,L^Galtier,N^Skot,L^Lucas,H^Foyer,CH^1998^1^Over-expression of sucrose phosphate synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana results in increased foliar sucrose/starch ratios and favours decreased foliar carbohydrate accumulation in plants after prolonged growth with CO2 enrichment^78^49^321^669-680^^^^^Apr^^^^^72651116^1437^1442^2410^3034^3290^3291^344^366^635^was higher in roots than in shoots, while organic acid concentration was higher in shoots.

Maximal extractable foliar SPS activities were three times those of the untransformed controls in the highest rbcS-SPS expressing line. In untransformed Arabidopsis leaves SPS activity was not subject to light/dark regulation, but was modified by incubation with either the inhibitor, orthophosphate, or the activator, mannose. Photosynthesis (A(max)) values were similar in all lines grown in air. After 10 weeks of CO, enrichment a decrease in A,,, in the untransformed controls, but not in the high SPS expressors, was observed. There was a strong correlation between the sucrose-to-starch ratio of the leaves and their SPS activity in both growth conditions. The total foliar carbohydrate contents of 4-week-old plants was similar in all lines whether plants were grown in air or with CO2 enrichment, After 10 weeks growth the leaves of the high rbcS-SPS expressors accumulated much less total carbohydrate than untransformed control leaves in both growth conditions.

In vitro plantlets were established in airtight or ventilated vessels with or without CO2 supplied (approximate to 1200.mu g L-1) through gas permeable films attached to the vessel's cap for 15 days before transplanting ex vitro. Leaves generated in vitro in ventilated vessels had a higher photosynthetic rate than those produced in airtight vessels, which lead to greater leaf expansion and shoot and root dry matter accumulation during in vitro culture and acclimatization. Enhanced photosynthesis in leaves of ventilated plantlets was positively correlated with chlorophyll content. Increasing photosynthetically active radiation from 70 to 200 mu mol.m(-1)-s(-1) enhanced the growth of in vitro plantlets under ventilated conditions but it depressed photosynthesis of the leaves grown photomixotrophically with sugar and CO2 enrichment which might be due to the feedback inhibition caused by marked accumulations of sucrose and starch.

In one study, cotton (cv. DPL 50) plants were grown at four temperatures (20/12, 25/17, 30/22, and 35/27 degrees C day/night) until harvest at 70 days after emergence (DAE). Each temperature treatment was combined with [CO2] of 350 or 700 mu L L-1. In another study, cotton (cv. DES 119) grown at two [CO2] received five N treatments (0, 1, 2, 6, and 10 mM NO3 in Hoagland's nutrient solution) at 17 DAE and every 2 days thereafter. Canopy gross photosynthetic rates increased with increasing [CO2] and temperature. The increased photosynthesis resulted in higher plant growth and dry matter accumulation rates except at the highest temperature. At 70 DAE, the maximum canopy dry matter accumulation rate occurred in 30/22 degrees C. The 35/27 degrees C treatment induced fruit abortion, resulting in greater dry matter accumulation in vegetative structures. Increases in plant dry weights by CO2 enrichment were greater in the two high temperature regimes than in the two lower temperature regimes. Water-use efficiency increased with increased [CO2] and decreased with increased temperature. Increases in water-use efficiency were due mainly to increased photosynthesis and partly to reduced canopy transpiration. Increase in leaf N concentration increased cotton photosynthesis and vegetative growth rates, and the increases were higher at 700 mu L L-1 than at 350 mu L L-1 [CO2].2255^6^Tanaka,M^Takamura,T^Watanabe,H^Endo,M^Yanagi,T^Okamoto,K^1998^1^In vitro growth of Cymbidium plantlets cultured under superbright red and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs)^361^73^1^39-44^^^^^Jan^^^^^7271243^2776^2837^874^accumulation rates except at the highest temperature.

Climate change scenarios included changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation from two GCMs interpolated to 1 degrees x1 degrees grid cells in the central Piedmont in North Carolina. Changes in mean monthly temperature and precipitation from the GCMs were used to adjust observed daily climate records from 1949-1988. There is convincing evidence that future temperature linked to global warming might be characterized by asymmetric change between daily daytime maxima and daily nighttime minima. Two hypotheses regarding how GCM temperature would alter observational record were examined. The first hypothesis assumed that daytime and nighttime warming occurs symmetrically, i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures are raised equally. The second hypothesis assumed that nighttime minima change is three times greater than daytime maxima change and the change in mean diurnal temperature range is approximately equal to the change in daily mean temperature. For the equal day-night warming scenario, when only the effects of climate change (i.e., changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) were considered, simulations with CERES and EPIC indicated substantial losses in maize grain yield and total above ground biomass with both the GCM scenarios. For the asymmetric warming, the reduction in biomass and yield due to climate change was less than that obtained with symmetric warming. Simulated maize yield and biomass with CERES and EPIC increased when only effects due to CO2-fertilization were considered. The inclusion of CO2 fertilization effects with those due to climate change resulted in higher biomass and yield compared to values obtained with effects of climate change alone. When CERES was used with the GFDL scenario, and the effects of CO2 fertilization and the climate change were combined, no difference in simulated yield was found between the two hypotheses; only an 8% difference in aboveground biomass was found when the UKMO scenario was used. When EPIC was used, the differential day-night warming hypothesis resulted in 9-13% less reduction in biomass and yield than did the use of the equal day-night warming hypothesis.

Anthocyanin concentration correlated well with the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase but not with glucosyltransferase activity. Moderate CO2 atmospheres (10 kPa) prolong the storage life and maintain quality of pomegranates, including adequate red color intensity of the arils.e resultA^7276^Leafy or chlorophyllous explants of a number of plant species currently micropropagated have been found to have high photosynthetic ability. Their growth and development have been promoted on sugar-free medium rather than on sugar-containing medium, provided that the environmental factors, such as CO2 concentration, light intensity and relative humidity, are controlled for promoting photosynthesis and transpiration of explants/shoots/plantlets in. vitro. Thus, environmental control is essential for promoting photosynthetic growth and development of in vitro plantlets. Several types of sugar-free (photoautotrophic) culture systems for large-scale micropropagation of plants have been developed. Advantages of sugar-free over conventional (heterotrophic or photomixotrophic) micropropagation systems are as follows: growth and development of plantlets in vitro are faster and more uniform, plantlets in vitro have less physiological and morphological disorders, biological contamination in vitro is less, plantlets have a higher percentage of survival during acclimatization ex vitro, and larger culture vessels could be used because of less biological contamination. Hence, production costs could be reduced and plant quality could be improved significantly with photoautotrophic micropropagation. Methods for the measurement and control of in vitro environments and the beneficial effects of environmental control on photosynthetic growth, development, and morphogenesis in large-scale production of micropropagated plantlets are presented.2259^4^Kuhn,M^Niewohner,C^Isenbeck-Schroter,M^Schulz,HD^1998^1^Determination of major and minor constituents in anoxic thermal brines of deep sandstone aquifers in Northern Germany^368^32^2^265-274^^^^^Feb^^^^^72792301^3302^3303^3304^3305^3306^rophic) micropropagation systems are as follows: growth and development of plantlets in vitro are faster and more uniform, plantlets in vitro have less physiological and morphological disorders, biological contamination in vitro is less, plantA^7278^The common process of low energy geothermal exploitation is the doublet of production- and reinjection borehole. The quality of water reinjected into a elastic reservoir is essential for the reliability of an injection well. In order to estimate precipitation reactions it is necessary to obtain extensive reliable analysis data of the water for the use of thermodynamic modelling. For thermal anoxic brines, the analysis of major and especially minor ion content is difficult because of matrix effects and possible iron precipitation. A selection of analysing methods were applied to two anoxic thermal brines of deep sandstone aquifers of Northern Germany. Detection limits and measured data of the major constituents are presented of Na+, K+, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Fe- total, Mn2+, SiO44-, B(OH)(3), Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, SO42-, SO32-, S2-, PO43-, NO3-, NO2- and DOC. The measurements were done with ICP-OES, ionselective electrodes, photometry, polarography, titration methods, ion chromatography and TOC-analyzer. Except for SO(4)(2-)and Cl-, the anion analysis was done on-site, since the high iron content in the anoxic water requires acidification in order to prevent iron hydroxide precipitation. The minor constituents Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Sc3+, Co2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce3+, Al3+, were enriched by trace matrix separation using the cation exchange resin Chelex((R))100. The element concentrations in the acidic eluates of the Chelex((R))100 columns were measured using ICP- MS. The pH dependency of the exchange equilibrium at pH values of 4, 5 and 6 (buffered and unbuffered) as well as the relation to the salt content between 35 and 250 gl(-1) total dissolved solids of Na-K-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 were evaluated by sensitivity analysis.

Experiments were conducted at ambient and twice ambient atmospheric CO2 concentrations at five temperatures. The 1995 temperature in Mississippi was used as a reference with the other temperatures being 1995 minus 2 degrees C, and 1995 plus 2, 5 and 7 degrees C. Daily and seasonal variation and amplitudes were maintained. Seedlings had 4-6 times as much leaf area and dry weight at 20 d after emergence when grown at 28 degrees C as at 23 degrees C (1995 ambient) average temperature during that growth period. Number of days to first square, flower, and open boil decreased as temperature increased. Double atmospheric CO2 did not affect these developmental rates. Temperatures above 28 degrees C, or 1995 average whole-season temperatures, were detrimental to mid-and late-season boil retention and growth. No fruits were retained to maturity at 1995 plus 5 or 7 degrees C. However, whole season vegetative growth was not significantly reduced by temperature 5-7 degrees C above the 1995 ambient conditions. Twice ambient CO2 caused about 40% increase in vegetative dry matter accumulation across temperatures. In a separate experiment, similar results were obtained on fruiting cotton grown at a range of temperatures based on long-term average US Midsouth July temperatures. Therefore, if global warming occurs as predicted, food and fibre production in such high- temperature and humid environments may be more limited to vegetative structures and the animals that consume vegetative structures.2261^3^Schenk,U^Jager,HJ^Weigel,HJ^1997^1^The response of perennial ryegrass white clover mini-swards to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations: effects on yield and fodder quality^369^52^3^232-241^^^^^Sep^^^^^72831262^137^1684^1958^1960^312^376^507^57^975^s, were detrimental to mid-and late-season boil retention and growth.

Mini-swards were cut four times at about monthly intervals at a height of 5 cm, dry- matter yields were determined and content of macroelements (N, P, K, S, Mg, Ca, Na) and crude fibre, crude protein and ash content were measured. The CO2-related increase in seasonal yield amounted to 16-38% for white clover monocultures, 12-29% for mixed swards and 5-9% for ryegrass monocultures. The white clover content of all swards was significantly enhanced by elevated CO2. The K and Na content of total yield was decreased by high CO2 but did not fall below the minimum requirements for ruminants. As the Ca content of total yield was increased by elevated CO2 and the P content was not changed, the Ca/P ratio of total yield was increased and exceeded values required for animal nutrition.

Endl.) trees were made under field conditions over three years to study changing relationships with tree age between respiration and phytomass, phytomass increment, and leaf mass. The relationship between annual respiration (r(a)) and phytomass (w(T)) was approximated by a proportional function (r(a) = aw(T)), where the proportional constant (a) decreased year by year. The effect of time on the relationship between annual respiration and phytomass of each sample tree was fitted by a power function. Respiration of the tree suppressed by the canopy decreased year by year, but respiration of the other trees increased slightly with age. The relationship between annual respiration and leaf mass was also approximated by a generalized power function. Excluding the suppressed tree, the relationship between annual respiration (r(a)) and the annual increment of aboveground phytomass (Delta w(T)) was described by a proportional function (r(a) = 2.27 Delta w(T)), where the proportional constant, 2.27, was independent of sample tree and year, indicating that about 2.3 times of the annual aboveground phytomass increment equivalent was respired annually. For any tree. the time constant relationships between annual respiration and leaf mass and phytomass increment for different-sized trees were similar to the corresponding time continuum relationships. In contrast, the time continuum relationship between annual respiration and phytomass differed from the time constant relationship, indicating that respiration of less active woody tissue contributed significantly to aboveground respiration.

Compared with the wild type, the anti-activase plants had reduced CO2 assimilation rates, normal contents of chlorophyll and soluble leaf protein, and much higher Rubisco contents, particularly in older leaves. Activase deficiency greatly delayed the usual developmental decline in Rubisco content seen in wild-type leaves. This effect was much less obvious in another transgenic tobacco with an antisense gene directed against chloroplast-located glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which also had reduced photosynthetic rates and delayed development. Although Rubisco carbamylation was reduced in the anti-activase plants, the reduction was not sufficient to explain the reduced photosynthetic rate of older anti- activase leaves. Instead, up to a 10-fold reduction in the catalytic turnover rate of carbamylated Rubisco in vivo appeared to be the main cause. Slower catalytic turnover by carbamylated Rubisco was particularly obvious in high-CO2-grown leaves but was also detectable in air-grown leaves. Rubisco activity measured immediately after rapid extraction of anti- activase leaves was not much less than that predicted from its degree of carbamylation, ruling out slow release of an inhibitor from carbamylated sites as a major cause of the phenomenon. Nor could substrate scarcity or product inhibition account for the impairment. We conclude that activase must have a role in vivo, direct or indirect, in promoting the activity of carbamylated Rubisco in addition to its role in promoting carbamylation.2265^1^Lal,R^1997^1^Residue management, conservation tillage and soil restoration for mitigating greenhouse effect by CO2-enrichment^370^43^1-2^81-107^^^^^1 Nov^^^^^7291in the reduced photosynthetic rate of 1104^2413^3308^3309^3310^3311^3312^3313^3314^3315^ld reduction in the catalytic turnover rate of carbamylated Rubisco in vivo appeared to be the main cause.

The greenhouse effect is among four principal ecological issues of global concern that include: (i) adequacy of land resources to meet needs of present and future generations; (ii) role of world soils and agricultural practices in the 'greenhouse' effect; (iii) potential of crop residue management, restoration of degraded soils, and conservation tillage in carbon sequestration in soil; and (iv) minimizing risks of soil degradation by enhancing soil resilience and soil quality. Annual increase in CO, concentration in the atmosphere is 3.2 x 10(15) g, and there exists a potential to mitigate this effect through C sequestration in soils. Just as world soils are an important active pool of organic carbon and play a major role in the global carbon cycle, crop residue is a major renewable resource which also has an important impact on the global carbon cycle. I have estimated the annual production of crop residue to be about 3.4 billion Mg in the world. If 15% of C contained in the residue can be converted to passive soil organic carbon (SOC) fraction, it may lead to C sequestration at the rate of 0.2 x 10(15) g/yr. Similarly restoring presently degraded soils, estimated at about 2.0 billion ha, and increasing SOC content by 0.01%/yr may lead C sequestration at the rate of 3.0 Pg C/yr. Conservation tillage is an important tool for crop residue management, restoration of degraded soil, and for enhancing C sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage, any tillage system that maintains at least 30% of the soil surface covered by residue, was practised in 1995 on about 40 x 10(6) ha or 35.5% of planted area in USA. It is projected that by the year 2020, conservation tillage may be adopted on 75% of cropland in USA (140 x 10(6) ha), 50% in other developed countries (225 x 10(6) ha), and 25% in developing countries (172 x 10(6) ha). The projected conversion of conventional to conservation tillage may lead to a global C sequestration by 2020 at a low estimate of 1.5 x 10(15) g, and at a high estimate of 4.9 x 10(15) g of C. These potentials of C sequestration can be realized through adoption of regional, national and global soil policy that stipulate appropriate use of world soil resources.

While underestimation and overestimation of the time courses of C-i in some treatments were observed the simulated values of C-i and the dry weight accumulation of the plantlets generally agreed with the measured values. The simulated responses of net photosynthetic rate of the plantlets to C-i indicated that in the early, culture period, plantlets have higher photosynthetic ability under photoautotrophic than under photomixotrophic culture conditions.

We present the results of growth and biomass after 4.5 years of CO2 exposure, one of the longest studies so far on deciduous tree species. We found that elevated CO2 led to a 58% increase in biomass at the end of the experiment. However, estimation of stem mass during the growing season showed that elevated CO2 did not affect relative growth rate during the fourth growing season, and therefore, that the large accumulation of biomass was the result of an early effect on relative growth rate in previous years. Trees grown in elevated CO2 invested more carbon into fine roots and had relatively less leaf area than trees grown in ambient CO2, In contrast with previous studies, acceleration of growth did not involve a significant decline in nutrient concentrations of any plant tissue. It is likely that increased fine root density assisted the trees in meeting their nutrient demands. Changes in the species composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the trees grown in elevated CO2 in favour of late successional species supports the hypothesis of an acceleration of the ontogeny of the trees in elevated CO2.

Attempts to balance the atmospheric carbon (C) budget have met with a large shortfall in C accounting (approximate to 1.4 x 10(15) g C y(-1)) and this has led to the hypothesis that C is being stored in the soil of terrestrial ecosystems. This study examined the effects of CO2 enrichment on soil C storage in C3 soybean (Glycine max L.) Merr. and C4 grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) Moench. agroecosystems established on a Blanton loamy sand (loamy siliceous, thermic, Grossarenic Paleudults). The study was a split-plot design replicated three times with two crop species (soybean and grain sorghum) as the main plots and two CO2 concentration (ambient and twice ambient) as subplots using open top field chambers. Carbon isotopic techniques using delta(13)C were used to track the input of new C into the soil system. At the end of two years, shifts in delta(13)C content of soil organic matter carbon were observed to a depth of 30 cm. Calculated new C in soil organic matter with grain sorghum was greater for elevated CO2 vs. ambient CO2 (162 and 29 g m(-2), respectively), but with soybean the new C in soil organic matter was less for elevated CO2 vs. ambient CO2 (120 and 291 g m(-2), respectively). A significant increase in mineral associated organic C was observed in 1993 which may result in increased soil C storage over the long-term, however, little change in total soil organic C was observed under either plant species. These data indicate that elevated atmospheric CO2 resulted in changes in soil C dynamics in agro-ecosystems that are crop species dependent.2270^3^Williams,RS^Lincoln,DE^Thomas,RB^1997^1^Effects of elevated CO2-grown loblolly pine needles on the growth, consumption, development, and pupal weight of red- headed pine sawfly larvae reared within open-topped chambers^127^3^6^501-511^^^^^Dec^^^^^73011080^1081^2530^3187^3317^489^546^628^764^774^13)C content of soilA^7300^Seedlings of loblolly pine, Pinus taeda, were grown in open- topped chambers under four levels of CO2: two ambient and two elevated. Larvae of the red-headed pine sawfly, Neoniprion lecontei, were reared from early instar to pupation, primarily on branches within chambers. Larval growth and mortality were assessed and leaf phytochemistry samples of immature and mature leaves collected weekly. Mature leaves grown under elevated CO2 had significant reductions in leaf nitrogen and increases in non-structural carbohydrate contents, resulting in foliage being a poorer food source for larvae, i.e. higher carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio. Nutritional constituents of immature needles were unaffected by seedling CO2 treatment. Volatile mono-and sesquiterpenes were unrelated to plant CO2 treatments for either leaf age class. Larval consumption of immature needles significantly increased on seedlings grown under CO2 enrichment, while mature needle consumption was not different between the treatments. The average weight gain per larva significantly declined in late instar larvae consuming elevated CO2-grown needles. In spite of this reduced growth, neither the days to pupation nor pupal weights were different among the CO2 treatments. This study suggests that enriched CO2-induced alterations in pine needle phytochemistry can affect red-headed pine sawfly performance, However, compensatory measures by larvae, such as choosing to consume more nutritious immature needles, apparently helps offset enriched CO2-induced reductions in the leaf quality of mature needles.2271^3^Bowden,RD^Newkirk,KM^Rullo,GM^1998^1^Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes by a forest soil under laboratory-controlled moisture and temperature conditions^130^30^12^1591-1597^^^^^Oct^^^^^7303310^3318^3319^3320^374^416^429^57^672^reatments for either leaf age class.

Long-Term Ecological Research Site (MA) and were incubated in the laboratory under a range of moisture (air-dry to nearly saturated) and temperature conditions (5-25 degrees C). Carbon dioxide emissions increased exponentially with increasing temperature in forest floor material, with emissions reduced at the lowest and highest soil moisture contents. The forest floor Q(10) of 2.03 (from 15-25 degrees C) suggests that CO2 emissions were controlled primarily by soil biological activity. Forest floor CO2 emissions were predicted with a multiple polynomial regression model (r(2) = 0.88) of temperature and moisture, but the fit predicting mineral soil respiration was weaker (r(2) = 0.59). Methane uptake was controlled strongly by soil moisture, with reduced fluxes under conditions of very low or very high soil moisture contents. A multiple polynomial model accurately described CH4 uptake by mineral soil material (r(2) = 0.81), but only weakly (r(2) = 0.45) predicted uptake by forest floor material. The mineral soil Q(10) of 1.11 for CH4 uptake indicates that methane uptake is controlled primarily by physical processes. Our work suggests that inclusion of both moisture and temperature can improve predictions of soil CO2 and CH4 exchanges between soils and the atmosphere. Additionally, global change models need to consider interactions of temperature and moisture in evaluating effects of global climate change on trace gas fluxes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is estimated at about 1400 Pg globally, which is roughly twice that in atmospheric CO2. The soil can act as both a source and a sink for carbon and nutrients, Changes in agricultural land use and climate can lead to changes in the amount of carbon held in soils, thus, affecting the fluxes of CO2 to and from the atmosphere. Some agricultural management practices will lead to a net sequestration of carbon in the soil. Regional estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of these practices are crucial if policy makers are to plan future land uses to reduce national CO, emissions. In Europe, carbon sequestration potential has previously been estimated using data from the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems Soil Organic Matter Network (GCTE SOMNET). Linear relationships between management practices and yearly changes in soil organic carbon were developed and used to estimate changes in the total carbon stock of European soils. To refine these semi-quantitative estimates, the local soil type, meteorological conditions and land use must also be taken into account. To this end, we have modified the Rothamsted Carbon Model, so that it can be used in a predictive manner. with SOMNET data. The data is then adjusted for local conditions using Geographical Information Systems databases. In this paper, we describe how these developments call be used to estimate carbon sequestration at the regional level using a dynamic simulation model linked to spatially explicit data. Some calculations of the potential effects of afforestation on soil carbon stocks in Central Hungary provide a simple example of the system in use.2274^5^Foley,JA^Levis,S^Prentice,IC^Pollard,D^Thompson,SL^1998^1^Coupling dynamic models of climate and vegetation^127^4^5^561-579^^^^^Jun^^^^^7309243^2491^2493^256^2762^3082^344^385^633^674^ices and yearly changes in soil organic carbon were developed and used to estimate changes in the total carbon stock of EuA^7308^Numerous studies have underscored the importance of terrestrial ecosystems as an integral component of the Earth's climate system. This realization has already led to efforts to link simple equilibrium vegetation models with Atmospheric General Circulation Models through iterative coupling procedures. While these linked models have pointed to several possible climate- vegetation feedback mechanisms, they have been limited by two shortcomings: (i) they only consider the equilibrium response of vegetation to shifting climatic conditions and therefore cannot be used to explore transient interactions between climate and vegetation; and (ii) the representations of vegetation processes and land-atmosphere exchange processes are still treated by two separate models and, as a result, may contain physical or ecological inconsistencies. Here we present, as a proof concept, a more tightly integrated framework for simulating global climate and vegetation interactions. The prototype coupled model consists of the GENESIS (version 2) Atmospheric General Circulation Model and the IBIS (version 1) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. The two models are directly coupled through a common treatment of land surface and ecophysiological processes, which is used to calculate the energy, water, carbon, and momentum fluxes between vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere. On one side of the interface, GENESIS simulates the physics and general circulation of the atmosphere. On the other side, IBIS predicts transient changes in the vegetation structure through changes in the carbon balance and competition among plants within terrestrial ecosystems. As an initial test of this modelling framework, we perform a 30 year simulation in which the coupled model is supplied with modern CO2 concentrations, observed ocean temperatures, and modern insolation. In this exploratory study, we run the GENESIS atmospheric model at relatively coarse horizontal resolution (4.50 latitude by 7.5 degrees longitude) and IBIS at moderate resolution (2 degrees latitude by 2 degrees longitude). We initialize the models with globally uniform climatic conditions and the modern distribution of potential vegetation cover. While the simulation does not fully reach equilibrium by the end of the run, several general features of the coupled model behaviour emerge. We compare the results of the coupled model against the observed patterns of modern climate. The model correctly simulates the basic zonal distribution of temperature and precipitation, but several important regional biases remain. In particular, there is a significant warm bias in the high northern latitudes, and cooler than observed conditions over the Himalayas, central South America, and north-central Africa. In terms of precipitation, the model simulates drier than observed conditions in much of South America, equatorial Africa and Indonesia, with wetter than observed conditions in northern Africa and China. Comparing the model results against observed patterns of vegetation coves shows that the general placement of forests and grasslands is roughly captured by the model. In addition, the model simulates a roughly correct separation of evergreen and deciduous forests in the tropical, temperate and boreal zones. However, the general patterns of global vegetation cover are only approximately correct: there are still significant regional biases in the simulation. In particular, forest cover is not simulated correctly in large portions of central Canada and southern South America, and grasslands extend too far into northern Africa. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of coupling climate models with fully dynamic representations of the terrestrial biosphere. Continued development of fully coupled climate-vegetation models will facilitate the exploration of a broad range of global change issues, including the potential role of vegetation feedbacks within the climate system, and the impact of climate variability and transient climate change on the terrestrial biosphere.s shows that the general placem2275^5^Hobbie,JE^Kwiatkowski,BL^Rastetter,EB^Walker,DA^McKane,RB^1998^1^Carbon cycling in the Kuparuk basin: Plant production, carbon storage, and sensitivity to future changes^278^103^D22^29065-29073^^^^^27 Nov^^^^^7311137^146^174^314^362^374^660^681^715^over are only approximately correct: there are still significant regional biases in the simulation.

Sensitivity to the direct effects of climate change were evaluated using a climate-space approach to delineate the range of thermal conditions tolerable by each species. Sensitivity to indirect effects were evaluated by quantifying the association of each species to the current vegetation distribution within the continental USA and using this association to assess whether wildlife species distributions might shift in response to vegetation shifts under climate change. Results indicate that altered thermal conditions alone should have little or no effect on the wildlife species' distributions as physiological tolerance to heat load would allow them to survive. Analyses of the effects of vegetation change indicate that deer and chipmunks should retain their current distributions and possibly expand westward in the USA. For Elk and ground squirrels, there is a possibility that their current distributions would shrink and there is little possibility that each species would spread to new regions. This work emphasizes that the distributions of the four mammalian species are likely to be influenced more by vegetation changes than by thermal conditions.

Quantitative assessment of the magnitude of climate change on a regional scale and its implications are essential for understanding, planning and management of resources at national/regional levels. In developing countries like India, where the economy is largely regulated by variability in summer monsoon rainfall, the consideration of measures for reducing the impacts of global change should begin as soon as possible, particularly with regard to floods and droughts, cyclone disaster preparedness, hydrological planning in semi-arid regions and coastal zone management issues. With this in view, we examine here the skill of a range of global climate models in simulating the regional climatology of the Indian subcontinent. This is a necessary first step in preparing climate change scenarios for the region. The simulation of the current broad scale patterns of mean sea level pressure, temperature and precipitation over the northern hemisphere and over the Indian subcontinent in particular are assessed for a broad range of global climate modelling experiments. The experiments included both slab ocean and coupled ocean experiments. Five experiments are identified as having a fairly realistic simulation and may be considered acceptable for use in regional climate change assessments. All of these are of relatively high resolution and use a Q-flux correction (in the slab ocean experiments) or a flux correction (in the coupled ocean experiments).

During the past 250 years the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O have increased by 30, 145, and 15%, respectively. A doubling of preindustrial CO2 concentrations by the end of the twenty-first century is expected to raise global mean surface temperature by about 2 degrees C and increase the frequency of severe weather events. These increases are attributed mainly to fossil fuel use, land-use change, and agriculture. Soils and climate changes are related by bidirectional interactions. Soil processes directly affect climatic changes through the production and consumption of CO2, CH4, and N2O and, indirectly, through the production and consumption of NH,, NO,, and CO. Although CO2 is primarily produced through fossil fuel combustion, land-use changes, conversion of forest and grasslands to agriculture, have contributed significantly to atmospheric increase of CO2. Changes in land use and management can also result in the net uptake, sequestration, of atmospheric CO2. CH4 and N2O are produced (30% and 70%, respectively) in the soil, and soil processes will likely regulate future changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases. The soil-atmosphere exchange of CO2, CH4, and N2O are interrelated, and changes in one cycle can im part changes in the N cycle and resulting soil-atmosphere exchange of N2O. Conversely, N addition increases C sequestration. On the other hand, soil processes are influenced by climatic change through imposed changes in soil temperature, soil water, and nutrient competition. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 alters plant response to environmental parameters and frequently results in increased efficiency in use of N and water. In annual crops increased CO2 generally leads to increased crop productivity. In natural systems, the long-term impact of increased CO2 on ecosystem sustainability is not known. These changes may also-result in altered CO2, CH4, and N2O exchange with the soil. Because of large temporal and spatial variability in the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases, the measurement of the absolute amount and prediction of the changes of these fluxes, as they are impacted by global change on regional and global scales, is still difficult. in recent years, however, much progress has been made in decreasing the uncertainty of field scale flux measurements, and efforts are being directed to large scale field and modeling programs.

The experiments were conducted over a 2-year period, and during that time, water table depth of drained plots was maintained on average 7 cm lower than the ambient water table, and surface temperatures of plots exposed to elevated temperature were increased on average 0.5 degrees C. Water table drainage, and to a lesser extent elevated temperature, resulted in significant increases in ecosystem respiration (ER) rates, and only small and variable changes in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP). As a result, drained plots were net sources of approximate to 40 gC m(-2) season(-1) over both years of manipulation, while control plots were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 of about 10 gC m(-2) season(- 1) (growing season length was an estimated 125 days). Control plots exposed to elevated temperatures accumulated slightly more carbon than control plots exposed to ambient temperatures. The direct effects of elevated temperature on net CO2 flux, ER, and GEP were small, however, elevated temperature appeared to interact with drainage to exacerbate the amount of net carbon loss. These data suggest that many currently saturated or nearly saturated wet sedge ecosystems of the north slope of Alaska may become significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere if climate change predictions of increased evapotranspiration and reduced soil water status are realized. There is ample evidence that this may be already occurring in arctic Alaska, as a change in net carbon balance has been observed for both tussock and wet-sedge tundra ecosystems over the last 2-3 decades, which coincides with a recent increase in surface temperature and an associated decrease in soil water content. In contrast, if precipitation increases relatively more than evapotranspiration, then increases in soil moisture content will likely result in greater carbon accumulation.2281^2^Scurlock,JMO^Hall,DO^1998^1^The global carbon sink: a grassland perspective^127^4^2^229-233^^^^^Feb^^^^^7323137^2100^2487^327^3331^344^454^58^661^672^A^7322^The challenge to identify the biospheric sinks for about half the total carbon emissions from fossil fuels must include a consideration of below-ground ecosystem processes as well as those more easily measured above-ground.

The terrestrial biosphere is a dynamic system that interacts with the atmosphere and climate principally through the exchanges of energy, water, and elements. Due to the limitations of equilibrium terrestrial biosphere models, new generation models - dynamic biosphere models, are critically needed for assessing and predicting the primary production and biogeochemical cycles of the terrestrial biosphere in changing global environment. The goal of dynamic biosphere modeling is to model terrestrial ecosystem dynamics induced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances, as well as the interactions of energy, water, and carbon cycles within the terrestrial biosphere and between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. The critical gaps in developing such a terrestrial biosphere model are not our inability to construct model code but instead the poorly developed links between empiricism and the concepts we used to construct our models, especially a lack of data that would help to make our models mechanistic, an incomplete fundamental knowledge about how complex terrestrial ecosystems work, a poor understanding of how to scale up what we do know and of how to validate such a model.

However, there are large uncertainties in data on regional forest condition, estimates of future climate, and quantitative relationships between environmental conditions and forest growth rate. We constructed a new model to analyze these uncertainties along with available experimental results to make probabilistic estimates of climate change effects on the growth of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) throughout its range in the USA. Complete regional data sets were created by means of spatial interpolation, and uncertainties in these data were estimated. A geographic information system (GIS) was created to integrate current and predicted climate data with regional data including forest distribution, growth rate, and stand characteristics derived from USDA Forest Service data. A probabilistic climate change scenario was derived from the results of four different general circulation models (GCM). Probabilistic estimates of forest growth were produced by linking the GIS to a Latin Hypercube carbon (C) budget model of forest growth. The model estimated a greater than 50% chance of a decrease in loblolly pine growth throughout most of its range. The model also estimated a 10% chance that the total regional basal area growth will decrease by more than 24 X 10(6) m(2) yr(-1) (a 92% decrease), and a 10% chance that basal area growth will increase by more than 62 X 10(6) m(2) yr(-1) (a 142% increase above current rates). The most influential factor at all locations was the relative change in C assimilation. Of climatic factors, CO2 concentration was found to be the most influential factor at all locations.

Thalli showed no evidence of a down- regulation in photosynthetic capacity following long-term exposure to CO2 enrichment in the field; carboxylation efficiency, total Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) content, apparent quantum yield of CO2 assimilation, and the light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (measured under ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations) were similar in thalli from the naturally CO2 enriched site and an adjacent control site where the average long-term CO2 concentration was about 355 mu mol mol(-1). Thalli from both CO2 environments exhibited low CO2 compensation points and early saturation of CO2 uptake kinetics in response to increasing external CO2 concentrations, suggesting the presence of an active carbon- concentrating mechanism. Consistent with the lack of significant effects on photosynthetic metabolism, no changes were found in the nitrogen content of thalli following prolonged exposure to elevated CO2. Detailed intrathalline analysis revealed a decreased investment of nitrogen in Rubisco in the pyrenoid of algae located in the elongation zone of thalli originating from elevated CO2, an effect associated with a reduction in the percentage of the cell volume occupied by lipid bodies and starch grains. Although these differences did not affect the photosynthetic capacity of thalli, there was evidence of enhanced limitations to CO2 assimilation in lichens originating from the CO2-enriched site. The light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation measured at the average growth CO2 concentration was found to be significantly lower in thalli originating from a CO2-enriched atmosphere compared with that of thalli originating and measured at ambient CO2, At lower photosynthetic photon flux densities, the light compensation point of net CO2 assimilation was significantly higher in thalli originating from elevated CO2 and this effect was associated with higher usnic acid content.2288^2^McConnaughay,K D M^Coleman,J S^1999^1^Biomass allocation in plants: Ontogeny or optimality?

Individuals of the annual plant species Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, and Polygonum pensylvanicum were grown from locally field-gathered seed in controlled greenhouse conditions across gradients of light, nutrients, and water. Frequent harvests were used to determine the growth and allocation (root vs. shoot, and leaf area vs. biomass) responses of these plants over a 57-d period. Growth analysis revealed that each species displayed significant plasticity in growth rates and substantial amounts of ontogenetic drift in root: shoot biomass ratios and ratios of leaf area to biomass across each of the three resource gradients. Ontogenetically controlled comparisons of root : shoot and leaf area ratios across light and nutrient gradients were generally consistent with predictions based on optimal partitioning theory; allocation to roots decreased and leaf area increased under low light and high nutrient conditions. These trends were confirmed, though were less dramatic, in allometric plots of biomass allocation throughout ontogeny. These species did not alter biomass allocation (beyond ontogenetic drift) in response to the broadly varying water regimes. Furthermore, many of the observed differences in biomass allocation were limited to a given time during growth and development. We conclude that, for these rapidly growing annual species, plasticity in biomass allocation patterns is only partially consistent with optimal partitioning theory, and that these plastic responses are ontogenetically constrained. Further, while these species did adjust biomass allocation patterns in response to light and nutrient availability, they did not adjust biomass allocation in response to water availability, despite dramatic plasticity in growth rates along all three resource gradients.

The microcosms with the two treatments were transferred separately to four growth chambers to incubate them under 16 h/8 h light and dark conditions. Two of the growth chambers set at 25 and 35 degrees C provided a continuous how of elevated CO2 (equivalent to 800 mu L L-1). Similarly the other two growth chambers were run under near ambient CO2 (400 mu L L-1) conditions at each of the two temperatures. The amounts of soluble carbon, microbial biomass C, chlorophyll-type compounds, and organic C in the surface (0- 1 cm) and sub-surface (below 1 cm) soil layers were measured at 15, 30, and 45 d after incubation. The amount of soluble carbon in the straw-amended soil gradually decreased throughout the incubation period, while no significant differences were detected among the four different conditions. The interactive effects of both elevated CO2 and temperature were found to be positive in terms of the size of the microbial biomass in surface soil, although no significant differences were detected in the subsurface. However, the amount of total soil organic C was larger in the soils incubated at a lower temperature. The amounts of chlorophyll-type compounds doubled in the surface soil when the soils were incubated under elevated CO2 conditions, indicating that the higher incubation concentration of CO2 promoted the growth of algae in surface soil.2290^4^Reddy,K R^Davidonis,G H^Johnson,A S^Vinyard,B T^1999^1^Temperature regime and carbon dioxide enrichment alter cotton roll development and fiber properties^48^91^5^851-858^^^^^Sep-Oct^^^^^73461163^3338^3339^467^614^92^easured at 15, 30, and 45 d after incubation.

An experiment aas conducted in naturally lit plant growth chambers to determine the influence of temperature and atmospheric [CO2] on cotton (cv. DPL-51) boll and fiber growth parameters. Five temperature regimes were evaluated: the 1995 temperature at Mississippi State, MS; the 1995 temperature minus 2 degrees C; and the 1995 temperature plus 2, 5, and 7 degrees C. Daily and seasonal variation and amplitudes were maintained. Atmospheric [CO2] treatments were 360 (ambient) and 720 mu L L-1. Boll number, bell growth, and fiber properties were measured. Boll size and maturation periods decreased as temperature increased. Boll growth increased with temperature to 25 degrees C and then declined at the highest temperature. Boll maturation period, size, and growth rates were not affected by atmospheric [CO2]. The most temperature-sensitive aspect of cotton development is boll retention. Almost no bells were retained to maturity at 1995 plus 5 or 7 degrees C, but squares and bells were continuously produced even at those high temperatures. Therefore, the upper limit for cotton boil survival is 32 degrees C, or 5 degrees C warmer than the 1995 U.S. Mid-South ambient temperatures. The 720 mu L L-1 atmospheric [CO2] had about 40% more squares and bells across temperatures than the 360 mu L L-1 [CO2], Fibers were longer when bells grew at less than optimal temperatures (25 degrees C) for boll growth. As temperature increased, fiber length distributions were more uniform. Fiber fineness and maturity increased linearly with the increase in temperature up to 26 degrees C, but decreased at 32 degrees C. Short-fiber content declined linearly from 17 to 26 degrees C, but was higher at higher temperature. As for boll growth and developmental parameters, elevated atmospheric [CO2] did not affect any of the fiber parameters. Changes in temperature, however, had a dramatic effect on boll set and tiber properties. The relationships between temperature and boll growth and developmental rate functions and fiber properties provide the necessary functional parameters to build fiber models under optimum water and nutrient conditions.2291^2^Rouhier,H^Read,D J^1999^1^Plant and fungal responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 in mycorrhizal seedlings of Betula pendula^173^42^3^231-241^^^^^Dec^^^^^73481983^2034^243^3340^376^423^430^437^57^92^ when bells grew at less than optimal temperatures (25 degrees C) for boll growth.

M plants, colonised by the fungus Paxillus involutus, and NM plants, were exposed for 3 months to ambient (350 mu l 1(-1)) or elevated (700 mu l 1(-1)) CO2 environments. The assimilation and distribution of carbon within the different compartments of the plant-substrate-fungal system were investigated using radioactive carbon as a tracer. In addition, the impact of elevated CO2 upon extension growth of the ectomycorrhizal mycelium of the fungus was determined in transparent observation chambers. Yields of whole plants and of shoots were significantly decreased under elevated CO2 whether they were grown with or without their fungal symbionts. Neither the dry mass production of roots of mycorrhizal plants, nor the amount of carbon allocated to shoots, roots and mycorrhizal tips were affected by elevated CO2. While the number of mycorrhizal root tips was decreased with CO2 enrichment, their relative importance in the total root system was unchanged. There was a significant increase in the extent of development of the external mycelium under elevated CO2. A greater proportion of the radioactive carbon was allocated to the soil compartment under elevated CO2. This increase, probably arising through increased rhizodeposition, was greater in NM than M plants. The responses are discussed in terms of nutrient availability in the growth media and the possible role of increased carbon allocation to mycorrhizal mycelium in nature.

Tolerance was determined by following the growth of Amaranthus retroflexus L. (redroot. pigweed), a C-4 species, and Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), a C-3 species, grown at near ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) and twice ambient (720 mu mol mol(-1)) [CO2] for 14 d following glyphosate application at rates of 0.00 (control), 0.112 kg ai ha(-1) (0.1 x the commercial rate), and 1.12 kg ai ha(-1) (1.0 x the commercial rare) in four separate trials. Irrespective of [CO2], growth of the C-4 species, A. retroflexus, was significantly reduced and was eliminated altogether at glyphosate application rates of 0.112 and 1.12 kg ai ha(-1), respectively. However, in contrast to the ambient [CO2] treatment, an application rate of 0.112 kg ai ha(-1) had no effect on growth, and a 1.12 kg ai ha(-1) rate reduced but did not eliminate growth in elevated [CO2]-grown C. album. Although glyphosate tolerance does increase with plant size at the time of application, differences in glyphosate tolerance between CO2 treatments in C. album cannot be explained by size alone. These data indicate that rising atmospheric [CO2] could increase glyphosate tolerance in a C-3 weedy species. Changes in herbicide tolerance at elevated [CO2] could limit chemical weed control efficacy and increase weed-crop competition.2293^4^Schortemeyer,M^Atkin,O K^McFarlane,N^Evans,J R^1999^1^The impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 and nitrate supply on growth, biomass allocation, nitrogen partitioning and N-2 fixation of Acacia melanoxylon^92^26^8^737-747^^^^^^^^^^73522601^2742^312^3343^3344^361^376^384^429^672^ether at glyphosate application rates of 0.112 and 1.12 kg ai ha(-1), respectively.

Plants were exposed to ambient (similar to 350 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (similar to 700 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2 for 6 weeks. Total plant dry mass increased strongly with nitrate supply. The proportion of nitrogen derived from air decreased with increasing nitrate supply. Plants grown under either ambient or elevated CO2 fixed the same amount of nitrogen per unit nodule dry mass (16.6 mmol N per g nodule dry mass) regardless of the nitrogen treatment. CO2 concentration had no effect on the relative contribution of N2 fixation to the nitrogen yield of plants. Plants grown with greater than or equal to 50 mmol m(-3) N and elevated CO2 had approximately twice the dry mass of those grown with ambient CO2 after 42 days. The rates of net CO2 assimilation under growth conditions were higher per unit leaf area for plants grown under elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 also decreased specific foliage area, due to an increase in foliage thickness and density. Dry matter partitioning between plant organs was affected by ontogeny and nitrogen status of the plants, but not by CO2 concentration. In contrast, plants grown under elevated CO2 partitioned more of their nitrogen to roots. This could be attributed to reduced nitrogen concentrations in foliage grown under elevated CO2.2294^4^Aben,S K^Seneweera,S P^Ghannoum,O^Conroy,J P^1999^1^Nitrogen requirements for maximum growth and photosynthesis of rice, Oryza sativa L-cv.

Maximum growth and photosynthetic potential was greater at 70 than 36 Pa CO2 at all N concentrations in the solution. Elevated CO2 reduced leaf N concentrations required to support 90% of maximum growth and photosynthetic rates (critical concentration) from 40 to 27 g kg(-1) for growth and from 45 to 30 g kg(-1) for photosynthesis. Morphological changes at elevated CO2 included increased tiller numbers and reduced leaf area ratio. The latter could be explained by lower plant N concentrations which occurred at high CO2 at each N concentration in the solution, primarily due to lower leaf blade and root N concentrations. Changes in tiller numbers at high CO2 were unrelated to leaf or plant N but were strongly correlated with leaf soluble carbohydrate concentrations. We conclude that elevated CO2 alters the nutritional physiology of rice during the rapid tillering phase in a way that increases the efficiency of N utilisation for growth and photosynthesis.2295^2^Kellomaki,S^Wang,K Y^1999^1^Short-term environmental controls of heat and water vapour fluxes above a boreal coniferous forest: model computations compared with measurements by eddy correlation^81^124^2-3^145-173^^^^^13 Dec^^^^^7356256^2712^3345^3346^3347^3348^372^3874^586^605^itical concentration) from 40 to 27 g kg(-1) for growth and from 45 to 30 g kg(-1) for photosynthesis.

A 'resistance/energy' model is constructed and parametrized in order to reproduce the dynamics of water and heat exchange between the soil, the canopy and the atmosphere as a part of a larger forest ecosystem model (FinnFor; Kellomaki and Vaisanen, 1997). Unique features of the present model are that (1) energy flux equations are expressed in terms of conceptual resistances and their solutions are obtained by closing two surface energy budget equations defined separately for canopy and soil surface; (2) the forest canopy is divided into shaded and sunlit fractions in the radiation transfer submodel and the canopy resistance submodels; (3) a numerical integrating solutions are derived separately for net radiation absorption in the canopy, bulk canopy resistance and the bulk aerodynamic resistances of the forest; and (4) iterative determinations of canopy water potential based on a classical one-dimensional water how model enable the model to represent explicitly the interaction between the above-ground and the below-ground water dynamics. The model is validated against 19-day flux measurements. In general, the total system sensible heat flux (H), total system latent heat flux (lambda E), canopy latent heat flux (lambda E-c), and soil surface heat flux (G(s)) computed by the model matched well with the measured data. Based on 1/2 h flux measurements, daily lambda E varied from 0.50-7.38 MW m(-2), H from 0.64-8.3 MW m(-2): and lambda E-c from 0.30-6.93 MW m(-2). The Bowen ratio (H/lambda E) ranged from -4.5 to 9.8, but 82% of the values for the Bowen ratio were within 0.5-2.5. The model computations showed that daily lambda E-c and H-c accounted for 21-64% and 43-66% of the daily total system flux, respectively. Daily soil latent heat (lambda E,) and soil sensible heat (H-s) fluxes accounted for 0.02-4.5% and 0.05-7.6%, respectively, and the daily energy storage within the canopy (S-c) and G(s) accounted for 0.1-7.2% and 0.8-5.6%, respectively. Plotting of 1/2 h flux data against a single environmental factor indicated that a 68% change in lambda E-c and a 72% change in H-c can be explained by a change in canopy radiation absorption (R-nc) at the 5% probability level. The high correlation between the canopy fluxes and R-nc could be related to the moderate weather conditions and high soil water content during the selected days, whereas lambda E- s, H-s, S-c and G(s) give no significant correlation with R-n. As expected. lambda E-c was strongly dependent on canopy resistance (r(cs)), but less impact on aerodynamic resistances during most of the measuring time.

This study evaluates controls on the size of the leachable soil N pool concurrent with the spring hydrologic flush that is primarily responsible for the transport of N to surface water. In high elevation catchments in the western United States, sources of N during this snowmelt flush include both atmospheric N deposition stored in the snowpack until melt and mobile soil N pools, and sinks are dominated by biogeochemical processes that occur in soil under snow cover. Because soil processes may serve either as a source or sink for N, controls on the amount of inorganic N leached from soil during the snowmelt period were evaluated in the major landscape types in four catchments in Colorado. Measurements of leached N were inversely related to measurements of over-winter CO2 flux at all sites, indicating that N was immobilized in soil heterotrophic biomass. Because over-winter soil heterotrophic activity is controlled primarily by the depth and timing of snow accumulation, the importance of these plot scale measurements to catchment scale N export were evaluated using a long-term record of winter precipitation, N deposition, and N export from Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park. This data set identified a strong, linear relationship (r(2) = 0.68) between catchment scale N retention and winter snow cover, consistent with subnivean, soil based controls on the mobile N pool identified at the plot scale. These results indicate that the winter snow pack is the major control both on hydrologic N export and on soil source/sink relationships for N concurrent with this transport mechanism. The effect of winter snow cover on the fate of both atmospheric and soil N needs to be considered when evaluating potential the effects of increased N deposition on either terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems in seasonally snow-covered watersheds. In these systems, changes in surface water chemistry are likely to occur in high deposition, snow-covered sites during low snow years before terrestrial vegetation is affected.

This paper reports the effects of this treatment on the growth, development and phenology of the branches, including shoot expansion, shoot numbers, needle dimensions, needle numbers and stomatal density. The effect of elevated [CO2] on the relationship between leaf area and sapwood area was investigated. Exposure to elevated [CO2] doubled photosynthetic rates in current-fear shoots and, despite some downregulation, 1-yr-old E shoots also had higher rates of photosynthesis than their A counterparts. Thus, the amount of assimilate fixed by E branches was substantially more than that fixed by A branches; hen-ever, this increase in the local production of assimilate did not lead to an increase in non-structural carbohydrate or stimulate growth or meristematic activity within the E branches. There was a very consistent relationship between leaf area and stem cross-sectional area that was not influenced by [CO2]. However, unbagged branches had thicker stems than bagged branches, resulting in a slightly lower ratio of leaf area to cross-sectional area.

In this work the model was used to study the impact of different management strategies on the productivity of grassland under present and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In LINGRA-CC simulated key processes are light utilization, leaf formation, leaf elongation, tillering and carbon partitioning. The daily growth rate is determined by the minimum of a sink and a source term. As in a previous model (LINGRA), the potential growth of the sink depends on the mean daily temperature, and can be modified by the effects of the availability of assimilates on tillering. The growth of roots is calculated from the amount of carbohydrates the shoot is unable to utilize when the number or activity of the sinks is small (overflow hypothesis). The main difference between LINGRA and LINGRA-CC is the way the source of assimilates for growth is calculated. Assimilate production depends on intercepted radiation, and a photosynthetic light- use efficiency (LUE) calculated as a function of CO2, temperature, light intensity and the Rubisco concentration of upper leaves. Other differences are that in LINGRA-CC, the specific shoot area for new growth depends on the level of reserves. Data from two independent experiments with L, perenne swards, grown in enclosures at two levels of CO2 during 1994 and 1995, were used to calibrate and validate the model, respectively. The model predicted well the observed amounts of harvested biomass, and the dynamics of the leaf area index, tiller number and specific shoot area. LINGRA-CC was used to stud? the effects of different combinations of cutting interval and cutting height on biomass production, at ambient (350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) and double (700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) CO2 conditions.

Application of ethanol vapour to the stems significantly reduced leaf blackening. Stems exposed to 5.6 g ethanol kg(-1) stem weight, had the least amount of leaf blackening with less than 20% of leaves blackened by day 14. In contrast, the control stems had 50% of leaves blackened by day 9, and 100% by day 15. The highest ethanol treatment at 11.2 g ethanol kg(-1) stem weight caused substantial blackening within the first 24 h of the treatment being applied. Ethanol vapour concentrations in the bag head space decreased rapidly in comparison with the bags with no stems, suggesting that ethanol was rapidly taken up by the stems. Only the highest ethanol treatment had detectable levels of ethanol in the bags after 17 days, and ethanol vapour had no effect on CO2 concentration in the bag head space. Carbon dioxide concentrations ranged between 1.0 and 2.5%. The rate of leaf blackening on the bagged stems without ethanol was significantly less than on stems not in bags, suggesting that elevated CO2 levels may have contributed to reduced blackening.

This could have serious consequences for those areas of the world which are present-day 'hotspots' for erosion. By means of a case study, this paper suggests an approach to quantifying the change in risk of serious erosion for sites in such areas. The case study focuses on future erosion under intensive soya bean cultivation in the Mate Grosso area of Brazil. On the area's highly erodible latosols, current erosion problems are severe. Scenarios of change future climate change are taken from general circulation models (GCMs) and used to perturb current- climate weather data. These are input to an erosion model (water erosion prediction project (WEPP)-CO2), together with local knowledge regarding current and probable future land use, in order to estimate future changes in erosion rates. WEPP- simulated average annual sediment yield increases in one of the scenarios and decreases in the other two, reflecting the range of uncertainty in predictions of future rainfall. Using the 'best-guess' climate scenario from the UK Meteorological Office's HADCM2 GCM, the increase in mean annual sediment yield is 27%. Increases are disproportionately greater in wetter years. Average rates for individual months increase by over 100%. Erosion increases most on those parts of the hillslope profile which are currently hardest-hit by erosion. At present, an annual sediment yield of 5 t ha(-1) is currently exceeded in about 1 year in 2.

To resolve this uncertainty, net C exchange has been measured at several sites in the boreal forest of Canada as part of the Boreal Ecosystem- Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). One of these sites is the Southern Old Aspen site at which diurnal CO2 and energy (radiation, latent, and sensible heat) fluxes were measured during 1994 using eddy correlation techniques at different positions within a mixed 70 year old aspen-hazelnut forest. These measurements were used to test a complex ecosystem model "ecosys" in which mass and energy exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere are simulated hourly under diverse conditions of soil, management, and climate. These simulations explained between 70% and 80% of diurnal variation in ecosystem CO2 and energy fluxes measured during three 1 week intervals in late April, early June, and mid-July. Total annual CO2 fluxes indicated that during 1994, aspen was a net sink of 540 (modeled) versus 670 (measured) g C m(-2) yr(-1), while hazelnut plus soil were a net source of 472 (modeled) versus 540 (measured) g C m(-2) yr(-1). The aspen-hazelnut forest at the BOREAS site was therefore estimated to be a net sink of about 68 (modeled) versus 130 (measured) g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 1994. Long-term simulations indicated that this sink may be larger during cooler years and smaller during warmer years because C fixation in the model was less sensitive to temperature than respiration. These simulations also indicated that the magnitude of this sink declines with forest age because respiration increases with respect to fixation as standing phytomass grows. Confidence in the predictive capabilities of ecosystem models at decadal or centennial timescales is improved by well-constrained tests of these models at hourly timescales.fluxes measured during three 1 week intervals in late April, early June, and mid-July.

Biomass, biomass distribution, growth rates, and leaf initiation and expansion rates were unaffected by elevated CO2. Leaf nitrogen (N), the leaf C:N ratio, and leaf lignin concentrations were also unaffected. Carbon gain was significantly greater in expanding leaves of saplings grown at elevated compared to ambient CO2. The Rubisco content in expanding leaves was not affected by CO2 concentration. Carbon gain and Rubisco content were significantly lower in fully expanded leaves of saplings grown at elevated compared to ambient CO2, indicating CO2-induced down-regulation in fully expanded leaves. Elevated CO2 likely had no overall effect on bio mass accumulation due to the more rapid decline in carbon gain as leaves matured in saplings grown at elevated compared to ambient CO2.

Elevated CO2 did not modify relative growth rate or biomass at either irradiance. Foliar carbon-to-nitrogen ratios were decreased at elevated CO2 and plants had a greater number of shorter tillers, particularly at the lower growth irradiance. Both light-limited and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were stimulated. The amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) protein was increased at elevated CO2, but maximum extractable Rubisco activities were not significantly increased. A pronounced decrease in the Rubisco activation stale was found with CO2 enrichment, particularly at the higher growth irradiance. Elevated-CO2- induced changes in leaf carbohydrate composition were small in comparison to those caused by changes in irradiance. No CO2- dependent effects on fructan biosynthesis were observed. Leaf respiration rates were increased by 68% in plants grown with CO2 enrichment and low light. We conclude that high CO2 will only result in increased biomass if total light input favourably increases the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio.

Relative to plants grown at ambient CO2 levels, plants grown under elevated CO2 accumulated ca. 20% more biomass and 23% more leaf area. When measured at the CO2 concentration of growth, mature leaves of high-CO2-grown plants had higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (ca. 15%), lower stomatal conductance (71%), higher water-use efficiency (225%) and higher dark respiration rates (100%). High-CO2-grown plants had lower carboxylation efficiencies (23%), measured under limiting CO2, and lower leaf protein contents (22%).

The increased capacity to synthesize sucrose and starch, and to utilize these endproducts of photosynthesis to produce extra energy by respiration, may contribute to the enhanced growth of maize under elevated CO2.2309^1^Cebrian,J^1999^1^Patterns in the fate of production in plant communities^16^154^4^449-468^^^^^Oct^^^^^7383268^2799^3368^3369^338^372^534^57^672^699^rates (100%).

Maximal total chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations of primary leaves from all four CO2 growth treatments were 0.36 +/- 0.01 g m(-2), and these concentrations were observed 10-12 d after sowing (DAS).

It was investigated here by using the comprehensive forest growth model CenW 1.0.5 which integrates routines for the fluxes of carbon and water, interception of radiation and the cycling of nutrients. It was run with water and/or nutrient limitations on a background of naturally observed climate at Canberra, Australia. It was parameterised for Pinus radiata, the commercially most important plantation species in Australia. The simulations showed that under water-limited conditions, forest growth was highly sensitive to doubling CO2, with growth increases of over 50% on average and even greater increases in dry years. In contrast, when water supply was adequate, but nutrients were limiting, growth increases were smaller, with an initial increase of about 15% during the first year after CO2 was doubled. This growth increase diminished further over subsequent years so that after 20 years, there was virtually no remaining effect. This diminishing response was due to developing nutrient limitations caused by extra carbon input which immobilised nutrients in the soil. When both water and nutrients were adequate, growth was increased by about 15-20% with no decrease over time. Increasing ambient temperature had a positive effect on growth under nutrient limited conditions by stimulating nitrogen mineralisation rates, but had very little effect when nutrients were non-limiting. Responses were qualitatively similar when conditions were changed gradually. In response to increasing CO2 by 2 mu mol mol(-1) yr(-1) over 50 years, growth was increased by only 1% under nutrient- limited condition but by 16% under water-limited conditions. When temperature and CO2 were both changed to emulate conditions between 1950 and 2030, growth was enhanced between 5-15% over the 80-year period due to the effect of CO2 on photosynthesis and water economy especially under water-limited conditions, and due to the effect of increasing temperature in mineralising greater amounts of nutrients. These results show that there is not one universally applicable biological growth response to increasing temperature and CO2, but that they interact in complex ways with a number of other growth limiting factors. Any response factor of plants to CO2 can only be quantified if the important interacting factors can be independently characterised for different situations.2313^2^Davies,S J^Unam,L^1999^1^Smoke-haze from the 1997 Indonesian forest fires: effects on pollution levels, local climate, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and tree photosynthesis^45^124^2-3^137-144^^^^^6 Dec^^^^^73901134^1547^312^3371^3372^372^417^738^893^92^but by 16% under water-limited conditions.

This model represents biogeochemical, biophysical and biogeographical processes, coupling the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles on a sub-daily timestep, simulating potential vegetation and transient changes in annual growth and competition between eight generalized plant types in response to climate. Global vegetation carbon was predicted to rise from about 600 to 800 PgC (or to 650 PgC for HadCM3) while the soil carbon pool of about 1100 PgC decreased by about 8%. By the 2080s, climate change caused a partial loss of Amazonian rainforest, C-4 grasslands and temperate forest in areas of southern Europe and eastern USA, but an expansion in the boreal forest area. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation in many tropical areas, southern Europe and eastern USA tin response to warming and a decrease in rainfall), but an increase in NPP of boreal forests.

Global net ecosystem productivity (NEP) increased from about 1.3 PgC y(-1) in the 1990s to about 3.6 PgC y(-1) in the 2030s and then declined to zero by 2100 owing to a loss of carbon from declining forests in the tropics and at warm temperate latitudes - despite strengthening of the carbon sink at northern high latitudes.

By the end of June, before the development of macroscopic leaf injury, the raised O-3 levels had not affected the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis. However, acclimation to elevated CO2 had resulted in lowered chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, whereas photosynthetic performance, examined over a wide range of parameters from light and dark reactions, remained unchanged or showed only slight reductions (e.g. apparent electron transport rate, ETR; apparent quantum yield of CO2 gas exchange, Phi(CO2); apparent carboxylation efficiency, CE; and photosynthetic capacity at light and CO2 saturation, PC). In August, after the appearance of leaf necroses, plants grown under ambient CO2 and twice-ambient O-3 conditions declined in both the photosynthetic light reactions (optimum electron quantum yield, Fv/F-m, non-photochemical energy quenching, NPQ, reduction state of Q(A), apparent electron quantum yield, Phi(PSI)I, maximum electron transport rates) and the dark reactions as reflected by CE, Phi(CO2), as well as the maximum CO2 uptake rate (i.e. PC). CE, Phi(CO2) and PC were reduced by c. 75, 40 and 75%, respectively, relative to plants exposed to ambient CO2 and O-3 levels. By contrast, plants exposed to twice-ambient O-3 and elevated CO2 levels maintained a photosynthetic performance similar to individuals grown either under ambient CO2 and ambient O-3, or elevated CO2 and ambient O-3 conditions.

Contents of non-structural carbohydrates mere analysed enzymatically in leaves, stems and ears six times during the growing season. The impact of elevated CO2 on wheat carbohydrates was non-significant in most harvests. However, differences in the carbohydrate contents due to elevated CO2 were found in all plant compartments. Before anthesis, at growth stage (GS) 30 (the stem is 1 cm to the shoot apex), the plants grown in elevated CO2 contained significantly more mater soluble carbohydrates (WSC), fructans, starch and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) in the leaves in comparison with the plants groan in ambient CO2. It is hypothesised that the plants from the treatments with elevated CO2 were sink-limited at GS30, After anthesis, the leaf WSC and TNC contents of the plants from elevated CO2 started to decline earlier than those of the plants from ambient CO2. This may indicate that the leaves of plants grown in the chambers with elevated CO2 senesced earlier. Elevated CO2 accelerated grain development: 2 weeks after anthesis, the plants groan in elevated CO2 contained significantly more starch and significantly less fructans in the ears compared to the plants grown in ambient CO2. Elevated CO2 had no effect on ear starch and TNC contents at the final harvest. Increasing the CO2 concentration from 360 to 520 mu mol mol(-1) had a larger effect on wheat nonstructural carbohydrates than the further increase from 520 to 680 mu mol mol(-1).

Elevated CO2 could delay the onset of drought stress by decreasing transpiration rates, but this effect was avoided by subjecting plants to the same soil water content. Nodulated alfalfa plants subjected to ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 were either men watered or partially watered by restricting water to obtain 30% of the water content at field capacity (approximately 0.55 g water cm(-3)). The negative effects of sop water deficit on plant growth were counterbalanced by elevated CO2. In droughted plants, elevated CO2 stimulated carbon fixation and, as a result, biomass production was even greater than in well-watered plants grown in ambient CO2. Below-ground production was preferentially stimulated by elevated CO2 in droughted plants, increasing nodule biomass production and the availability of photosynthates to the nodules. As a result, total nitrogen content in droughted plants was higher than in well-watered plants grown in ambient CO2. The beneficial effect of elevated CO2 was not correlated with a better plant water status. It is concluded that elevated CO2 enhances growth of droughted plants by stimulating carbon fixation, preferentially increasing the availability of photosynthates to below-ground production (roots and nodules) without improving water status. This means that elevated CO2 enhances the ability to produce more biomass in N-2-fixing alfalfa under given soil water stress, improving drought tolerance.2318^2^Peng,C H^Apps,M J^1999^1^Modelling the response of net primary productivity (NPP) of boreal forest ecosystems to changes in climate and fire disturbance regimes^81^122^3^175-193^^^^^20 Oct^^^^^74001298^178^2762^3084^3197^3374^3375^3376^344^372^ion was preferentially stimulated by elevated CO2 in droughted plants, increasing nodule biomass production and the availability A^7399^This study reports on the use of the process-based ecosystem model CENTURY 4.0 to investigate the patterns of net primary productivity (NPP) along a transect across the boreal forests of central Canada and the influence of climate change, CO2 fertilization and changing fire disturbance regimes on changes in NPP over time. Simulated NPP was tested against observed NPP data from northern sites near Thompson (Manitoba) and southern sites near Prince Albert (Saskatcheuan) and shown to be consistent with the data. The temporal dynamics of NPP were very different for the southern, central and northern sites, consistent with the hypothesis that different climate-driven processes regulate forest growth in the various regions of the boreal forest transect case study (BFTCS). The simulations suggest that climate change would result in increased NPP for most sites across the transect. According to the model results, increases in atmospheric CO2 also show increased NPP. The combined influence of climate change and elevated CO2 appear to interact in a positive, but non-linear manner. Statistical analysis of the simulation results indicate that changes in NPP are also positively correlated with changes in net N mineralization (R-2 = 0.89). This supports the conclusion that feedback via N cycling - a coupling of aboveground production with changes in belowground decomposition - is very important for understanding the NPP dynamics of the boreal forest under a changing climate. It was also found that NPP increases with greater fire frequency under current climate conditions, at least over the range of fire return intervals considered (50- 200 years).

Besides a synoptic review of some of the most prominent above-ground response processes, particular attention is given to below-ground responses of trees to elevated atmospheric CO2, while some feedback processes and interactions with Various biotic and abiotic factors are also briefly summarized. At the leaf level there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Future studies on photosynthesis measurements will probably not alter our conclusions about acclimation, but should focus more on respiration under elevated CO2, which is still poorly understood. At the tree level, the increase in growth observed in elevated CO2 results from an increase in both leaf area and leaf photosynthetic rate (per unit leaf area). Tree growth enhancement is generally larger at high rates of nutrient supply; when nutrient supply rates do not meet growth rates, tree nutrient status declines and nutrients become limiting. In many studies at the canopy level, a shift in whole-tree carbon allocation pattern towards below-ground parts has been associated with increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At the ecosystem level, a larger amount of carbon being allocated below-ground could show up by either (1) more root growth and turnover, (2) enhanced activity of root-associated microorganisms, (3) larger microbial biomass pools and enhanced microbial activity, or (4) increased losses of soil carbon through soil respiration. Fine root production is generally enhanced, but it is not clear whether this response would persist in a forest. As elevated CO2 stimulates biomass production, litterfall and rhizodeposition also increase. This increased delivery of labile organic matter to the soil could influence soil microbial communities and subsequent decomposition rates, nutrient availability and carbon storage in soil. There are, however, contradictory hypothesis about the direction in which nutrient availability will be affected. Knowledge of the response of these and other ecophysiological processes to elevated CO2 is the key to understanding the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem. Our current knowledge is sufficiently large with regard to how the carbon uptake process and individual tree growth respond under atmospheric changes, but more emphasis should be put in future experiments on the interactions between various processes, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles, and on below-ground responses.

Potential impacts of global climate change [elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and/or elevated temperature] on rice can be predicted with simulation models, but experiments are necessary to determine how well these models mimic the responses of the field crop. This paper compares grain yield, biomass, and methane emissions from experiments at the international Rice Research Institute (IRRI) at Los Banos, the Philippines, with potential responses based on simulations using the ORYZA1 process model and the climate data from those experiments. Yield and biomass were compared for the 1995 and 1996 dry seasons (DS) and the 1994 wet season (WS). Emissions of CH4 from rice fields were evaluated for the 1995 WS and 1996 DS, Simulated and experimental responses (adjusted for effects of the open-top chambers on plant growth) differed with climate change scenario, response parameter, and season Under current climate conditions (ambient CO2 and ambient temperature), simulated grain yield was 14% lower than the adjusted experimental grain yield in the 1996 DS, but was 17 and 37% higher than experimental grain yield in the 1995 DS and 1994 WS, respectively. With current climate, simulations underestimated experimental aboveground, belowground, and total biomass. The simulated CH4 emissions were the same as the experimental emissions, assuming CH4 emissions were 2.9% of the simulated total biomass carbon. With elevated CO7 and ambient temperature, simulations predicted greater increases (compared with current climate) in grain yield, aboveground biomass, and total biomass, but generally smaller increases in belowground biomass and CH4 emissions than the significant (at p < 0.05) increases that were found experimentally. With ambient CO2 and elevated temperature, both simulations and experiments generally showed either no change or a decrease in grain yield and biomass, but none of the responses in the experiments wen statistically significant. Simulated ambient CO2 and elevated temperature resulted in a smaller decrease in CH4 emissions than the significant decrease found in the experiments. For both elevated CO2 and elevated temperature, simulated grain yield increased in all three seasons, whereas there were no significant effects on experimental grain yield. The simulations predicted smaller increases in belowground biomass and CH4 emissions with elevated CO2 and elevated temperature than the significant increases in the experiments.

Here we report the results from two complementary studies designed to determine the importance of sex and habitat on gas exchange and growth of male and female individuals of a dioecious, circumpolar willow, Salix arctica, in the Canadian High Arctic. In field studies, male and female willows from dry and wet habitats were subjected to passively enhanced summer temperature (similar to 1.3 degrees C) using small open-top chambers over three years. Peak season gas exchange varied significantly by willow sex and habitat. Overall net assimilation was higher in the dry habitat than in the wet, and higher in females than in males. In the dry habitat, net assimilation of females was enhanced by experimental warming, but decreased in males. In the wet habitat, net assimilation of females was substantially depressed by experimental warming, while males showed an inconsistent response. Development and growth of male and female catkins were enhanced by elevated temperature more than leaf fascicles, but leaf fascicle development and growth varied more between the two habitats, particularly in males. In a controlled environment study, male and female willows from these same wet and dry habitats were grown in a 2x2 factorial experiment including 1 x or 2 x ambient [CO2] and 5 or 12 degrees C.

For all experimental treatments, the C:N ratio of the top soil organic matter fractions increased with their particle size. Elevated CO2 concentration increased the C:N ratios of the below-ground phytomass and of the macro-organic matter. A supplemental fertiliser N or a 3 degrees C increase in elevated [CO2] reduced it. At the last sampling date, elevated [CO2] did not affect the C:N ratio of the soil organic matter fractions, but increased significantly the accumulation of roots and of macro- organic matter above 200 mu m (MOM). An increased N-fertiliser supply stimulated the accumulation of the non harvested plant phytomass and of the OM between 2 and 50 mu m, without positive effect on the macro-organic matter > 200 mu m. Elevated [CO2] increased C accumulation in the OM fractions above 50 mu m by +2.1 tC ha(-1), on average, whereas increasing the fertiliser N supply led to an average supplemental accumulation of +0.8 tC ha(-1).

The same properties of forests also provide for large potential rates of deposition of pollutant gases, aerosols and cloud droplets. For some reactive pollutant gases, including SO2, HNO3 and NH3, rates of deposition may be large and substantially larger than onto shorter vegetation and is the cause of the so called "filtering effect" of forest canopies. Pollutant inputs to moorland and forest have been compared using measured ambient concentrations from an unpolluted site in southern Scotland and a more polluted site in south eastern Germany. The inputs of S and N to forest at the Scottish site exceed moorland by 16% and 31% respectively with inputs of 7.3 kg S ha(-1) y and 10.6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). At the continental site inputs to the forest were 43% and 48% larger than over moorland for S and N deposition with totals of 53.6 kg S ha(-1) y(-1) and 69.5 kg N ha(-)1 y(- )1 respectively. The inputs of acidity to global forests show that in 1985 most of the areas receiving > 1 kg H+ ha(-1) y(-1) as S are in the temperate latitudes, with 8% of total global forest exceeding this threshold. By 2050, 17% of global forest will be receiving > 1 kg H-1 ha(-1) as S and most of the increase is in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Forests throughout the world are also exposed to elevated concentrations of ozone. Taking 60 ppb O-3 as a concentration likely to be phytotoxic to sensitive forest species, a global model has been used to simulate the global exposure of forests to potentially phytotoxic O-3 concentrations for the years 1860, 1950, 1970, 1990 and 2100. The model shows no exposure to concentrations in excess of 60 ppb in 1860, and of the 6% of global forest exposed to concentrations > 60 ppb in 1950, 75% were in temperate latitudes and 25% in the tropics. By 1990 24% of global forest is exposed to O-3 concentrates > 60 ppb, and this increases to almost 50% of global forest by 2100. While the uncertainty in the future pollution climate of global forest is considerable, the likely impact of O-3 and acid deposition is even more difficult to assess because of interactions between these pollutants and substantial changes in ambient CO2 concentration, N deposition and climate over the same period, but the effects are unlikely to be beneficial overall.2332^2^Rennenberg,H^Gessler,A^1999^1^Consequences of N deposition to forest ecosystems - Recent results and future research needs^94^116^1-2^47-64^^^^^Nov^^^^^74271951^2471^2584^2957^2993^3392^3396^3397^372^460^of forests to potentially phytotoxic O-3 concentrations for the years 1860, 1950, 1970, 1990 and 2100.

Still the consequences of atmospheric N deposition on N metabolism of trees and its interaction with soil microbial processes has only recently been studied. Atmospheric N deposited to the leaves is thought to enter the general N metabolism of the leaves, but the processes involved, the interaction with different metabolic pathways, and the connection between injury by atmospheric N and its metabolic conversion are largely unknown. Laboratory and field experiments have shown that N of atmospheric NO2 and NH3, deposited to the leaves of trees, is subject to long-distance transport in the phloem to the roots. This allocation can result in considerable decline of N uptake by the roots. Apparently, the flux of N from the soil into the roots can be down-regulated to an extent that equals N influx into the leaves. This down-regulation is not mediated by generally enhanced amino-N contents, but by elevated levels of particular amino acids. Field experiments confirm these results from laboratory studies: Nitrate (NO3) uptake by the roots of trees at a field sites exposed to high loads of atmospheric N is negligible, provided concentrations of Gln in the roots are high. At the ecosystem level, consequences of reduced N uptake by the roots of trees exposed to high loads of atmospheric N are (1) an increased availability of N for soil microbial processes, (2) enhanced emission of gaseous N-oxides from the soil, and (3) elevated leaching of NO3 into the ground water. How recent forest management practices aimed at transforming uniform monocultures to more structured species-rich forests will interact with these processes remains to be seen. Possible implications of these forest management practices on N metabolism in trees and N conversion in the soil are discussed particularly in relation to atmospheric N deposition.2333^2^McLaughlin,S^Percy,K^1999^1^Forest health in North America: Some perspectives on actual and potential roles of climate and air pollution^94^116^1-2^151-197^^^^^Nov^^^^^74291342^1654^3033^3398^3399^3400^3401^3402^3403^602^of trees at a field sites exposed to high loads of atmospheric N is negligible, provided concentrations of Gln in the roots are high.

North American forests are diverse in range, species composition, past disturbance history, and current management practices. Therefore the implications of changes in environmental stress from atmospheric pollution and/or global climate change on health of these forests will vary widely across the landscape. Forest health surveys that focus on the average forest condition may do a credible job of representing the near-term trends in economic value while failing to detect fundamental changes in the processes by which these values are sustained over the longer term. Indications of increased levels of environmental stress on forest growth and nutrient cycles are currently apparent in several forest types in North America. Measurements of forest ecophysiological responses to air pollutants in integrated case studies with four forest types (southern pine, western pine, high elevation red spruce, and northeastern hardwoods) indicate that ambient levels of ozone and/or acidic deposition can alter basic processes of water, carbon, and nutrient allocation by forest trees. These changes then provide a mechanistic basis for pollutant stress to enhance a wider range of natural stresses that also affect and are affected by these resources. Future climatic changes may ameliorate (+ CO2) or axacerbate (+ temperature, + UV-B) these effects. Current projections of forest responses to global climate change do not consider important physiological changes induced by air pollutants that may amplify climatic stresses. These include reduced rooting mass, depth, and function, increased respiration, and reduced water use efficiency. Monitoring and understanding the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic stress in influencing future forest health will require programs that are structured to evaluate responses at appropriate frequencies across gradients in both forest resources and the stresses that influence them. Such programs must also be accompanied by supplemental process -oriented and pattern -oriented investigations that more thoroughly test cause and effect relationships among stresses and responses of both forests and the biogeochemical cycles that sustain them.2334^3^Broadmeadow,M S J^Heath,J^Randle,T J^1999^1^Environmental limitations to O-3 uptake - Some key results from young trees growing at elevated CO2 concentrations^94^116^1-2^299-310^^^^^Nov^^^^^7431312^3129^3404^3405^344^376^384^417^633^861^do not consider important physiological changes induced by air pollutants that may amplify climatic stresses.

However, parameterisation of a stomatal conductance model for Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica grown under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations in a separate experiment has demonstrated that elevated CO2 also reduces the responsiveness of stomata to both saturation deficit (LAVPD) and soil moisture deficit (psi) in beech, and to a lesser extent, in oak.

Three clones (216 and 271[(O- 3 tolerant] and 259 [O-3 sensitive]) have been characterized for O-3 sensitivity by growth and biomass responses, foliar symptoms, gas exchange, chlorophyll content, epicuticular wax characteristics, and antioxidant production. In this study we compared the responses of these same clones exposed to O-3 under field conditions along a natural O-3 gradient and in a Free-Air CO2 and O-3 Enrichment (FACE) facility. In addition, we examined how elevated CO2 affected O-3 symptom development. Visible O-3 symptoms were consistently seen (5 out of 6 years) at two of the three sites along the O-3 gradient and where daily one-hour maximum concentrations were in the range of 96 to 125 ppb. Clonal differences in O-3 sensitivity were consistent with our OTC rankings. Elevated CO2 (200 ppm over ambient and applied during daylight hours during the growing season) reduced visible foliar symptoms for all three clones from 31 to 96% as determined by symptom development in elevated O-3 versus elevated O-3 + CO2 treatments. Degradation of the epicuticular wax surface of all three clones was found at the two elevated O-3 gradient sites. This degradation was quantified by a coefficient of occlusion which was a measure of stomatal occlusion by epicuticular waxes. Statistically significant increases in stomatal occlusion compared to controls were found for all three clones and for all treatments including elevated CO2, elevated O-3, and elevated CO2 + O-3.

Results of research on DT plants are compared with those on desiccation sensitive vascular Cg plants, the most widely investigated group in the field of global change. Both DT and non-DT plants show an immediate positive response of photosynthesis to elevated CO2, but in both groups the longer term effect is generally reduced (or even reversed) by down-regulation or feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, or other limitations on production and growth. In bryophytes and lichens, enhanced short-term photosynthesis may or may not be reflected in increased production; bryophytes have limited source-sink differentiation, and lichens invest excess photosynthate in secondary metabolites.

We conducted research to adapt and evaluate tower-based conditional sampling as a method for measuring net CO2 exchange (NCE) at the ecosystem scale on a continuous basis. With conditional sampling, NCE is determined from the product of the standard deviation of vertical wind velocity, the difference in CO2 concentration between updrafts and downdrafts in the constant flux portion of the boundary layer above the surface, and an empirical coefficient. We constructed a system that used a sonic anemometer to measure vertical wind velocity (w) and control a high-speed three-way valve that diverted air from updrafts and down,drafts into separate sample lines, depending on the direction of w. An infrared gas analyzer was used to measure the concentration difference. The conditional sampling system was installed and tested in a marsh in the Nueces River Delta near Corpus Christi, Texas, as part of a long-term study of effects of freshwater inflow on CO2 flux. System accuracy was evaluated by comparing conditional sampling measurements of water vapor flux with independent estimates obtained with the Bowen ratio method. Average daily flux estimates for the two methods agreed to within 13%. Measurements showed that freshwater inflow due to flooding of the Nueces River increased NCE by increasing CO2 assimilation and decreasing CO2 efflux. Over a 65-d period, daily NCE varied from a maximum gain of 0.16 mol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during flooding to a maximum loss of - 0.14 mol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) when the marsh dried.

Short-term CO2 enrichment stimulates the rate of photosynthesis. Plant mass is also enhanced by CO2 enrichment. However, the effects of long-term CO2 enrichment on photosynthesis are variable. Generally, the prolonged exposure to CO2 enrichment reduces the initial stimulation of photosynthesis in many species, and frequently suppresses photosynthesis. These responses are attributed to secondary responses related to either excess carbohydrate accumulation or decreased N content rather than direct responses to CO2. Accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves may lead to the repression of photosynthetic gene expression and excess starch seems to hinder CO2 diffusion. Therefore, the species which have the sink organs for carbohydrate accumulation do not show the suppression of photosynthesis. The suppression of photosynthesis by CO2 enrichment is always associated with decreases in leaf N and Rubisco contents. These decreases are not due to dilution of N caused by a relative increase in the plant mass but are the result of a decrease in N allocation to leaves at the level of the whole plant, and the decrease in Rubisco content is not selective. Leaf senescence and plant development are also accelerated by CO2 enrichment. However, they are independent of each other in some species. Thus, various responses to CO2 observed at the level of a single leaf result from manifold responses at the level of the whole plant grown under conditions of CO2 enrichment.2344^3^Mitchell,K A^Bolstad,P V^Vose,J M^1999^1^Interspecific and environmentally induced variation in foliar dark respiration among eighteen southeastern deciduous tree species^13^19^13^861-870^^^^^Nov^^^^^7450130^1314^2068^3266^3414^360^520^547^783^92^the sink organs for carbohydrate accumulation do not show the suppression of photosynthesis.

Our overall objective was to estimate leaf respiration rates under typical conditions and to determine how they varied within and among species. Mean dark respi ration rate at 20 degrees C (R- d,R-mass, mu mol CO2 (kg leaf dry mass)(-1) s(-1)) for all 18 species was 7.31 mu mol kg(-1) s(-1). Mean R-d,R-mass of individual species varied from 5.17 mu mol kg(-1) s(-1) for Quercus coccinea Muenchh, to 8.25 mu mol kg(-1) s(-1) for Liriodendron tulipifera L. Dark respiration rate varied by leaf canopy position and was higher in leaves collected from high- light environments. When expressed on an area basis, dark respiration rate (R-d,R-area, mu mol CO2 (kg leaf dry area)(-1) s(-1)) showed a strong linear relationship with the predictor variables leaf nitrogen (N-area, g N (m leaf area)(-2)) and leaf structure (LMA, g leaf dry mass (m leaf area)(-2)) (r(2) = 0.62). This covariance was largely a result of changes in leaf structure with canopy position; smaller thicker leaves occur at upper canopy positions in high-light environments. Mass-based expression of leaf nitrogen and dark respiration rate showed that nitrogen concentration (N-mass, mg N (g leaf dry mass)(- 1)) was only moderately predictive of variation in R-d,R-mass for all leaves pooled (r(2) = 0.11), within species, or among species. We found distinct elevational trends, with both R-d,R- mass and N-mass higher in trees originating from high- elevation, cooler growth environments. Consideration of interspecies differences, vertical gradients in canopy light environment, and elevation, may improve our ability to scale leaf respiration to the canopy in forest process models.2345^3^Hu,S J^Firestone,M K^Chapin,F S^1999^1^Soil microbial feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 enrichment^57^14^11^433-437^^^^^Nov^^^^^7452a1298^2087^2758^3083^3415^3416^398^506^534^715^A^7451^Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration often stimulates plant photosynthesis, enhances carbon (C) allocation belowground, increases plant nutrient uptake and improves the efficiency of plant water use. Recent studies suggest that microbial responses to CO2-induced alterations in soil C, water and nutrient availability play an important role in determining ecosystem feedback to CO2 elevation. However, to date, most of the published results have been obtained from short-term experiments or from studies using high-nutrient or disturbed soils. Information on microbial responses to CO2-induced changes in natural and/or mature ecosystems with nutrient limitations is critical to predict changes in terrestrial ecosystem C storage under future CO2 scenarios.2346^4^Bezemer,T M^Knight,K J^Newington,J E^Jones,T H^1999^1^How general are aphid responses to elevated atmospheric CO2?^376^92^5^724-730^^^^^Sep^^^^^74541282^137^1752^2533^312^3417^3418^547^701^715^452aA^7453^We studied the impact of elevated CO2 on 2 aphid pest species, Myzus persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae (Homoptera: Aphididae), on a series of host plants in 3 independent studies each differing in experimental complexity. Measurements on individual aphids showed that host plant and aphid species significantly influenced the response to elevated CO2. These differences occurred not only in the level of responsiveness but also directionally. B. brassicae reared on Brassica oleracea produced significantly less offspring at elevated CO2, whereas the opposite was found for M. persicae on the same host. No response was found for M. persicae on Senecio vulgaris. When populations of B. brassicae and M. persicae were followed for a longer period, no differences were observed in population sizes, Comparisons between different experimental systems show that long-term population responses to elevated CO2 can not be reliably predicted from detailed measurements on individual aphids.

Appropriate rates of carbon acquisition by temperate and boreal forests are re-evaluatted, Based on continental-scale forestry data it is suggested that the productivity of temperate and boreal forests has been overestimated previously. 2, Using these values, a model of the integrated response of ecosystems to carbon dioxide concentration and soil nitrogen availability is presented. The model does not assume constant C/N ratios in plant or soil and considers effects of increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition separately or together. 3, For temperate-zone forests a co- occurrence of a CO2 increase and nitrogen deposition doubles the increase in net primary productivity and carbon sequestration that would be the case for nitrogen deposition occurring on its own. Considered separately, the effect of the atmospheric CO2 increase is less than even moderate rates of anthropogenic N deposition for temperate or boreal forests. By contrast, for tropical forests, the atmospheric CO2 increase is sufficient to induce large rates of carbon accumulation in plants and soil. 4, Application of the model at the global scale suggests large localized sinks for CO2 in either tropical rain forests or in forested or grassland areas of Europe and North America where appreciable N deposition occurs. Overall, the model suggests a terrestrial sink owing to CO2 fertilization and N deposition of about 0.2 Pmol C per year. About half of this is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere and about half in the tropics.2349^2^Soule,P T^Knapp,P A^1999^1^Western juniper expansion on adjacent disturbed and near-relict sites^319^52^5^525-533^^^^^Sep^^^^^74601203^312^3287^3420^3421^413^456^92^tivity and carbon sequestration that would be the case for nitrogen deposition occurring on its own.

The 3 sites are located in central Oregon at the confluence of the Deschutes and Crooked Rivers. Two of the sites are typical of central Oregon rangelands in that they have a history of anthropogenic disturbance including active fire suppression and domestic livestock grazing. The third site is a relict mesa that is a protected Research Natural Area and has experienced minimal anthropogenic impacts. We used large scale aerial photography to determine cover and density of western juniper in 1951, 1956, 1961, 1972, 1982, and 1994. We found that western juniper density and cover during the last 4 decades increased at all sites, with changes on the relict site similar to those on one of the disturbed sites. We suggest that even though 2 of the traditionally cited causes of western juniper expansion since the late 1800s (altered fire regimes, domestic livestock grazing) may have contributed to expansion on our disturbed sites, these mechanisms can not explain expansion on the near- relict mesa. Further, we examined climatic changes since 1900 in the region and concluded that the data did not fully support a climate-driven mechanism for the expansion. In seeking to explain western juniper expansion on semiarid rangelands, we suggest that all potential causal mechanisms (e.g., fire history, biological inertia, climate, domestic grazing, atmospheric CO2 enrichment) be considered.2350^4^Atkin,O K^Schortemeyer,M^McFarlane,N^Evans,J R^1999^1^The response of fast- and slow-growing Acacia species to elevated atmospheric CO2: an analysis of the underlying components of relative growth rate^2^120^4^544-554^^^^^Sep^^^^^74621030^312^3422^3423^400^417^669^705^867^lict site similar to those on one of the disturbed sites.

Specifically. we asked whether fast- and slow-growing species systematically differ in their response to elevated CO2. Four slow-growing species from semi- arid environments (Acacia aneura, A. colei, A. coriacea and A. tetragonophylla) and six fast-growing species from mesic environments (Acacia dealbata, A. implexa, A. mearnsii, A. melanoxylon, A. irrorata and A. saligna) were grown in glasshouses with either ambient (similar to 350 ppm) or elevated (similar to 700 ppm) atmospheric CO2. All species reached greater final plant mass with the exception of A. aneura, and RGR, averaged across all species, increased by 10% over a 12-week period when plants were exposed to elevated CO2. The stimulation of RGR was evident throughout the 12-week growth period. Elevated CO2 resulted in less foliage area per unit foliage dry mass, which was mainly the result of an increase in foliage thickness with a smaller contribution from greater dry matter content per unit fresh mass. The net assimilation rate (NAR, increase in plant mass per unit foliage area and time) of the plants grown at elevated CO2 was higher in all species (on average 30% higher than plants in ambient CO2) and was responsible for the increase in RGR. The higher NAR was associated with a substantial increase in foliar nitrogen productivity in all ten Acacia species. Plant nitrogen concentration was unaltered by growth at elevated CO2 for the slow-growing Acacia species, but declined by 10% for faster- growing species. The rate of nitrogen uptake per unit root mass was higher in seven of the species when grown under elevated CO2, and leaf area per unit root mass was reduced by elevated CO2 in seven of the species. The absolute increase in RGR due to growth under elevated CO2 was greater for fast- than for slow-growing Acacia species.oliage area per unit2351^3^Cater,M^Simoncic,P^Batic,F^1999^1^Pre-dawn water potential and nutritional status of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in the north-east of Slovenia^262^39^4^13-21^^^^^^^^^^74641034^2040^243^3424^361^372^386^514^912^92^A^7463^In the 1997 growth period monthly measurements of pre-dawn water potential, electrical resistance of the cambial zone, groundwater level and quality together with annual dynamics of macronutrive elements in leaves and heavy metals (Zn, Ph, Cd) were performed.

A decrease in the rate of transpiration due to increased p(CO2) may reduce the amount of P transported to the shoot, thereby causing a change in the partitioning of P between the root and shoot. To test these hypotheses, four concentrations of P in the nutrient solution, combined with two p(CO2) treatments, were applied to nodulated white clover plants. Compared to ambient p(CO2) (35 Pa), twice ambient p(CO2) (70 Pa) reduced the rate of transpiration but did not impair the total P uptake per plant. However, at twice ambient p(CO2) and a moderate to high supply of P, concentrations of structural P and soluble P (Pi) were lower in the leaves and higher in the roots. The activity of root acid phosphatase was lower at twice ambient p(CO2) than at ambient p(CO2); it depended on the Pi concentration in the roots. At the highest P concentration, twice ambient p(CO2) stimulated photosynthesis and the growth rate of the plant without affecting the concentration of nonstructural carbohydrates in the leaves. However, at the lower P concentrations, plants at twice ambient p(CO2) lost their stimulation of photosynthesis in the afternoon, they accumulated nonstructural carbohydrates in the leaves and their growth rate was not stimulated; indicating C-sink limitation of growth. P nutrition will be crucial to the growth of white clover under the expected future conditions of increased p(CO2).2354^2^Loiseau,P^Soussana,J F^1999^1^Elevated [CO2], temperature increase and N supply effects on the turnover of below-ground carbon in a temperate grassland ecosystem^206^210^2^233-247^^^^^^^^^^74701298^146^1768^178^2087^2604^3426^344^508^977^re lower in the leaves and higher in the roots.

During the growing season, swards from the control climate (350 mu l l(-1) [CO2] at outdoor air temperature) were pulse labelled by the addition of (CO2)-C-13. The elevated [CO2] treatments were continuously labelled by the addition of fossil-fuel derived CO2 (C-13 of -40 to -50 parts per thousand). Prior to the start of the experimental treatments, the carbon accumulated in the plant parts and in the soil macro-organic matter ('old' C) was at -32 parts per thousand. During the experiment, the carbon fixed in the plant material ('new' C) was at -14 and -54 parts per thousand in the ambient and elevated [CO2] treatments, respectively. During the experiment, the C-13 isotopic mass balance method was used to calculate, for the top soil (0-15 cm), the carbon turnover in the stubble and roots and in the soil macro-organic matter above 200 mu (MOM). Elevated [CO2] stimulated the turnover of organic carbon in the roots and stubble and in the MOM at N+, but not at N-. At the high N supply, the mean replacement time of 'old' C by 'new' C declined in elevated, compared to ambient [CO2], from 18 to 7 months for the roots and stubble and from 25 to 17 months for the MOM. This resulted from increased rates of 'new' C accumulation and of 'old' C decay. By contrast, at the low N supply, despite an increase in the rate of accumulation of 'new' C, the soil C pools did not turnover faster in elevated [CO2], as the rate of 'old' C decomposition was reduced. A 3 degrees C temperature increase in elevated [CO2] decreased the input of fresh C to the roots and stubble and enhanced significantly the exponential rate for the 'old' C decomposition in the roots and stubble. An increased fertiliser N supply reduced the carbon turnover in the roots and stubble and in the MOM, in ambient but not in elevated [CO2].

Here, we experimentally examine these two components by growing soybean (Glycine max) in two CO2 partial pressures, 35 and 70 Pa, and making a suite of ecophysiological measurements on expanding and fully expanded leaves. These CO2 treatments resulted in a variety of acclimation responses, including changes in net photosynthetic rate and capacity, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and respiration. These responses were strongly dependent on leaf age. Despite the wide variety of acclimation responses, the experimentally derived photosynthetic sensitivity did not vary with CO2 treatments or leaf age. In addition, the photosynthetic sensitivity to ambient CO2 partial pressure was consistent with the sensitivity to intercellular CO2 partial pressure, indicating little effect of stomatal conductance on photosynthetic sensitivity. This study supports the theoretical conclusion that photosynthetic sensitivity is independent of growth environment and leaf age, as well as photosynthetic acclimation, even though the latter varies with both environmental and developmental factors. Accordingly, photosynthetic sensitivity may be directly extrapolated from leaf to globe to predict the increment in terrestrial carbon influx stimulated by the yearly increase in atmospheric CO2, whereas the acclimation component must be used to adjust the overall global estimate.

Single-leaf CER values measured on plants grown at high CO2 were 50% greater than those measured on plants grown at ambient CO2 for all growth stages, with no photosynthetic acclimation observed at high CO2. Leaves grown in high CO2 had more starch and simple sugars at tillering and booting, and more starch at grain-filling, than those grown in ambient CO2. CER and carbohydrate levels were positively correlated with leaf appearance rates and tillering (especially third-, fourth- and fifth-order tillers). Elevated CO2 slightly delayed tiller appearance, but accelerated tiller development after appearance. Although high CO2 increased leaf appearance rates, final leaf number/culm was not effected because growth stages were reached slightly sooner. Greater plant biomass was related to greater tillering.

Airborne flux measurements during the BOREAS experiment were referenced to age of burn along a 500-km transect through Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. These data for 1-, 5-, and 7-year-old burns were supplemented with 15- and 30-year-old-burn data from the BOREAS northern study site near Thompson, Manitoba. Data were available near midday only and included the June, July and September campaigns during 1994, and July of 1996. Surface radiometric temperature increased by up to 6 degrees C and remained elevated even 15 years after fire. Net radiation was largely unaffected whereas albedo decreased in the first year post-fire but recovered by the fifth year. Sensible heat flux increased by 10-20% for the first few years after the fire and then decreased. Latent heat flux slightly decreased after the fire, causing the Bowen ratio to increase by ca. 50% for 7 years post-fire. The CO2 flux was reduced for the 15-year period after fire with the greatest reduction to ca. 25% of control areas during the year following fire.

Rhizoma peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) were grown on a natural field soil in temperature-gradient greenhouses to evaluate the effects of elevated [CO2] and temperature on tissue composition and digestibility during the establishment year. Carbon dioxide levels were maintained at 365 (ambient) and 640 mu L CO2 L-1 air. The temperature- gradient greenhouses were regulated to obtain air temperature sectors of 0.2, 1.5, 2.9, and 4.5 degrees C above ambient. Samples were taken of previously undefoliated herbage at 57, 86, 121, 148, and 217 days after planting and entire plots were harvested at 218 days after planting. Elevated [CO2] increased total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration in rhizoma peanut leaves by almost 50%. Rhizoma peanut leaf N concentration was 6% lower at elevated than at ambient [CO2]. The N concentration in new rhizomes of rhizoma peanut was increased by high [CO2], while the N concentration in bahiagrass was not affected by temperature or [CO2]. No effects of [CO2] and temperature were found on neutral detergent fibre in rhizoma peanut leaves or stems; however, elevated [CO2] increased neutral detergent fibre in bahiagrass leaves. Only at season end was in vitro organic matter digestion of rhizoma peanut higher at ambient (623 g kg(-1)) than at elevated [CO2] (609 g kg(-1)). Elevated [CO2] had a greater effect on tissue composition of rhizoma peanut than of bahiagrass. These data suggest that elevated temperature and CO2-induced changes in chemical composition of forage species adapted to humid subtropics will be relatively small, particularly for C4 species.2359^4^Friedlingstein,P^Joel,G^Field,C B^Fung,I Y^1999^1^Toward an allocation scheme for global terrestrial carbon models^127^5^7^755-770^^^^^Oct^^^^^74801262^1312^1315^1660^2056^2060^3149^3433^3434^504^ed than at ambient [CO2]. The A^7479^The distribution of assimilated carbon among the plant parts has a profound effect on plant growth, and at a larger scale, on terrestrial biogeochemistry. Although important progress has been made in modelling photosynthesis, less effort has been spent on understanding the carbon allocation, especially at large spatial scales. Whereas several individual-level models of plant growth include an allocation scheme, most global terrestrial models still assume constant allocation of net primary production (NPP) among plant parts, without any environmental coupling. Here, we use the CASA biosphere model as a platform for exploring a new global allocation scheme that estimates allocation of photosynthesis products among leaves, stems, and roots depending on resource availability. The philosophy underlying the model is that-allocation patterns result from evolved responses that adjust carbon investments to facilitate capture of the most limiting resources, i.e. light, water, and mineral nitrogen. In addition, we allow allocation of NPP to vary in response to changes in atmospheric CO2. The relative magnitudes of changes in NPP and resource-use efficiency control the response of root:shoot allocation. For ambient CO2, the model produces realistic changes in above- ground allocation along productivity gradients. In comparison to the CASA standard estimate using fixed allocation ratios, the new allocation scheme tends to favour root allocation, leading to a 10% lower global biomass. Elevated CO2, which alters the balance between growth and available resources, generally leads to reduced water stress and consequently, decreased root:shoot ratio. The major exception is forest ecosystems, where increased nitrogen stress induces a larger root allocation.2360^3^Kasurinen,A^Helmisaari,H S^Holopainen,T^1999^1^The influence of elevated CO2 and O-3 on fine roots and mycorrhizas of naturally growing young Scots pine trees during three exposure years^127^5^7^771-780^^^^^Oct^^^^^74821076^1983^243^264^374^376^377^407^483^92^A^7481^Young Scots pine trees naturally established at a pine heath were exposed to two concentrations of CO2 (ambient and doubled ambient) and two O-3 regimes (ambient and doubled ambient) and their combination in open-top field chambers during growing seasons 1994, 1995 and 1996 (late May to 15 September). Filtered ozone treatment and chamberless control trees were also included in the treatment comparisons. Root in-growth cores were inserted to the undisturbed soil below the branch projection of each tree at the beginning of the fumigation period in 1994 and were harvested at the end of the fumigation periods in 1995 and 1996. Root biomasses were determined from different soil layers in the ingrowth cores, and the infection levels of different mycorrhizal types were calculated. Elevated O-3 and CO2 did not have significant effects on the biomass production of Scots pine coarse (diameter >2 mm) or fine roots (diameter <2 mm) and roots of grasses and dwarf shrubs. Elevated O-3 caused a transient stimulation, observable in 1995, in the proportion of tuber-like mycorrhizas, total mycorrhizas and total short roots but this stimulation disappeared during the last study year. Elevated CO2 did not enhance carbon allocation to root,growth or mycorrhiza formation, although a diminishing trend in the mycorrhiza formation was observed. In the combination treatment increased CO2 inhibited the transient stimulating effect of ozone, and a significant increase of old mycorrhizas was observed. Our conclusion is that doubled CO2 is not able to increase carbon allocation to growth of fine roots or mycorrhizas in nutrient poor forest sites and realistically elevated ozone does not cause a measurable limitation to roots within a period of three exposure years.2361^5^Hungate,B A^Dijkstra,P^Johnson,D W^Hinkle,C R^Drake,B G^1999^1^Elevated CO2 increases nitrogen fixation and decreases soil nitrogen mineralization in Florida scrub oak^127^5^7^781-789^^^^^Oct^^^^^74841684^2102^341^3435^344^359^417^506^859^975^ransient stimulationA^7483^We report changes in nitrogen cycling in Florida scrub oak in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 during the first 14 months of experimental treatment. Elevated CO2 stimulated above-ground growth, nitrogen mass, and root nodule production of the nitrogen-fixing vine, Galactia elliottii Nuttall. During this period, elevated CO2 reduced rates of gross nitrogen mineralization in soil, and resulted in lower recovery of nitrate on resin lysimeters. Elevated CO2 did not alter nitrogen in the soil microbial biomass, but increased the specific rate of ammonium immobilization (NH4+ immobilized per unit microbial N) measured over a 24-h period. Increased carbon input to soil through greater root growth combined with a decrease in the quality of that carbon in elevated CO2 best explains these changes. These results demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 concentration influences both the internal cycling of nitrogen (mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification) as well as the processes that regulate total ecosystem nitrogen mass (nitrogen fixation and nitrate leaching) in Florida coastal scrub oak. If these changes in nitrogen cycling are sustained, they could cause long-term feedbacks to the growth responses of plants to elevated CO2. Greater nitrogen fixation and reduced leaching could stimulate nitrogen-limited plant growth by increasing the mass of labile nitrogen in the ecosystem. By contrast, reduced nitrogen mineralization and increased immobilization will restrict the supply rate of plant-available nitrogen, potentially reducing plant growth. Thus, the net feedback to plant growth will depend on the balance of these effects through time.2362^4^Constable,J V H^Guenther,A B^Schimel,D S^Monson,R K^1999^1^Modelling changes in VOC emission in response to climate change in the continental United States^127^5^7^791-806^^^^^Oct^^^^^7486312^3436^3437^3438^3439^3440^3441^372^669^92^ internal cycling of nitrogen (mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification) as well as the processes that regulate total ecosysA^7485^The alteration of climate is driven not only by anthropogenic activities, but also by biosphere processes that change in conjunction with climate. Emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vegetation may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate and may play an important role in climate forcing through their influence on the atmospheric oxidative balance, greenhouse gas concentration, and the formation of aerosols. Using the VEMAP vegetation database and associated vegetation responses to climate change, this study examined the independent and combined effects of simulated changes in temperature, CO2 concentration, and vegetation distribution on annual emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, and other reactive VOCs (ORVOCs) from potential vegetation of the continental United States. Temperature effects were modelled according to the direct influence of temperature on enzymatic isoprene production and the vapour pressure of monoterpenes and ORVOCs. The effect of elevated CO2 concentration was modelled according to increases in foliar biomass per unit of emitting surface area. The effects of vegetation distribution reflects simulated changes in species spatial distribution and areal coverage by 21 different vegetation classes. Simulated climate warming associated with a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration enhanced total modelled VOC emission by 81.8% (isoprene + 82.1%, monoterpenes + 81.6%, ORVOC + 81.1%), whereas a simulated doubled CO2 alone enhanced total modelled VOC emission by only + 11.8% (isoprene + 13.7%, monoterpenes + 4.1%, ORVOC + 11.7%). A simulated redistribution of vegetation in response to altered temperatures and precipitation patterns caused total modelled VOC emission to decline by 10.4% (isoprene -11.7%, monoterpenes -18.6%, ORVOC 0.0%) driven by a decline in area covered by vegetation classes emitting VOCs at high rates. Thus, the positive effect of leaf-level adjustments to elevated CO2 (i.e. increases in foliar biomass) is balanced by the negative effect of ecosystem-level adjustments to climate (i.e. decreases in areal coverage of species emitting VOC at high rates).2363^1^Cowling,S A^1999^1^Simulated effects of low atmospheric CO2 on structure and composition of North American vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum^377^8^2^81-93^^^^^Mar^^^^^74881103^1181^137^1980^256^372^399^539^625^659^d total modelled VOC emission by 81.8% (isoprene + 82.1%, monoterpenes + 81.6%, ORVOC + 81.1%), whereas a simulated doubled CO2 alone enhanced total modelled VOC emission by only + 11.8% (isoprene + 13.7%, monoterpenes + 4.1%, ORVOC + 11.7%).

Physiological experiments have indicated that the lower CO2 levels of the last glaciation (200 mu mol mol(-1)) probably reduced plant water-use efficiency (WUE) and that they combined with increased aridity and colder temperatures to alter vegetation structure and composition at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). 2.

These neighboring species benefit from the simple presence of the N fixation symbiosis in their surroundings. Because of this phenomenon, it has been hypothesized that a change in atmospheric CO2 concentration may alter the role of N-fixing trees in their environment. It is thought that the role of N-fixing trees in ecosystems of the future may be more important since they may help sustain growth increases due to increased CO2 concentration in nitrogen limited forests. We examined: (1) whether symbiotically fixed N was exuded from roots, (2) whether a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration would result in increased organic N exudation from roots, and (3) whether increased temperature or N availability affected N exudation from roots. This study analyzed exudation of dissolved organic N from the roots of seedlings of the N-fixing tree Robinia pseudoacacia L. in a full factorial design with 2 CO2 (35.0 and 70.0 Pa) x 2 temperature (26 or 30 degrees C during the day) x 2 N fertilizer (0 and 10.0 mM N concentration) levels. Trees with no other source of N except N fixation exuded about 1% to 2% of the fixed N through their roots as dissolved organic N. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations did not, however, increase N exudation rates on a per gram belowground biomass basis. A 4 degrees C increase in temperature and N fertilization did, however, significantly increase N exudation rates. These results suggest that exudation of dissolved organic N from roots or nodules of N-fixing trees could be a significant, but minor, pathway of transferring N to neighboring plants in a much more rapid and direct way than cycling through death, decomposition and mineralization of plant residues. And, while exudation rates of dissolved organic N from roots were not significantly affected by atmospheric CO2 concentration, the previously observed 'CO2 fertilization effect' on N-fixing trees suggests that N exudation from roots could play a significant but minor role in sustaining increases in forest growth, and thus C storage, in a CO2 enriched atmosphere.2367^2^Matamala,R^Drake,B G^1999^1^The influence of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on plant-soil nitrogen interactions in a wetland plant community on the Chesapeake Bay^206^210^1^93-101^^^^^^^^^^74961044^243^3019^3327^341^372^378^507^56^968^is.

Stands of S. olneyi responded to eight years of elevated CO2, by increased rates of net ecosystem gas exchange and a large stimulation of net ecosystem production. We conducted our study in the summer of 1994 and 1995 when soil cores were collected and aboveground biomass was estimated. Nitrogen concentration in elevated CO2 treatments was reduced 15% in stems of S. olneyi and 8% in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. While total plant nitrogen per unit of land area remained the same between treatments, total soil nitrogen showed a non- significant tendency to decrease in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile in elevated CO2 both years of study. A significant decrease in soil bulk density largely contributed to the observed decrease in soil nitrogen. Exchangeable nitrogen and potential denitrification rates were also reduced in elevated CO2, but net nitrogen mineralization was unchanged by elevated CO2 treatment in S. olneyi both years. Plants and soils in a pure stand of the C-4 grass, S. patens, showed none of these effects of elevated CO2 treatment.

The model prediction was based on modelling photosynthesis as a function of leaf N per unit leaf area (N-area), where N-area = N-mass x LMA. Here, N-mass is percentage leaf N and is used to estimate biochemical capacity and LMA is leaf mass per unit leaf area and is an index of leaf morphology. To assess the relative importance of changes in biochemical capacity versus leaf morphology we need to control for multiple correlations that are known, or that are likely to exist between CO2 concentration, N-area, N-mass, LMA and A(area). Although this is impractical experimentally, we can control for these correlations statistically using systems of linear multiple-regression equations. We developed a linear model to partition the response of A(area), to elevated CO2 into components representing the independent and interactive effects of changes in indexes of biochemical capacity, leaf morphology and CO2 limitation of photosynthesis. The model was fitted to data from three pine and seven deciduous tree species grown in separate chamber-based field experiments. Photosynthetic enhancement at elevated CO2 due to morphological upregulation was negligible for most species. The response of A(area), in these species was dominated by the reduction in CO2 limitation occurring at higher CO2 concentration. However, some species displayed a significant reduction in potential photosynthesis at elevated CO2 due to an increase in LMA that was independent of any changes in N-area. This morphologically based inhibition of A(area) combined additively with a reduction in biochemical capacity to significantly offset the direct enhancement of A(area) caused by reduced CO2 limitation in two species. This offset was 100% for Acer rubrum, resulting in no met effect of elevated CO2 on A(area) for this species, and 44% for Betula pendula.

The experimental site is located in a grassland at the Wytham estate, Oxfordshire, UK. The one hectare study area is within a 10 ha abandoned arable field on Jurassic corallian limestone. Two climate change scenarios were used: warmer winters with increased summer rainfall and warmer winters with summer drought. Plant cover and species richness were significantly increased in plots receiving supplemented summer rainfall, while the amount of litter was significantly reduced. Litter formation was significantly increased by winter warming and drought. The responses of the plant community to the climate manipulations were related to the life-history attributes of the dominant species. Seedling recruitment was limited by microsite availability, which also varied in the different climate manipulations. The results are discussed in terms of successional dynamics. They suggest that warmer winters may delay succession, as gap formation in the sward will provide sites for colonisation of annuals, thereby enabling their persistence in the sward. Under wetter conditions during summer, perennial grasses tend to close the sward, thereby inhibiting the establishment of later successional species.2370^2^Grimmer,C^Komor,E^1999^1^Assimilate export by leaves of Ricinus communis L. growing under normal and elevated carbon dioxide concentrations: the same rate during the day, a different rate at night^6^209^3^275-281^^^^^Sep^^^^^7502243^344^360^417^632^788^92^ litter was significantly reduced.

Carbon assimilation, assimilate deposition, dark respiration and assimilate mobilization were measured in leaves 2, 3 and 4 (counted from the base of the plant), and a balance sheet of carbon input and export was elaborated for both CO2 concentrations. Carbon dioxide assimilation was nearly constant over the illumination period, with only a slight depression occurring at the end of the day in mature source leaves, not in young source leaves, Assimilation was ca. 40% higher at 700 mu l l(-1) than at 350 mu l l(-1) CO2. The source leaves increased steadily in weight per unit area during the first 3 weeks, more at 700 mu l l(-1) than at 350 mu l l(-1) CO2. On top of an irreversible weight increase, there was a large gain in dry weight during the day, which was reversed during the night. This reversible weight gain was constant over the life time of the leaf and ca. 80% higher at 700 mu l l(-1) than at 350 yl l(-1). Most of it was due to carbohydrates. The carbon content (as a percentage) was not altered by the CO2 treatment. Respiration was 25% higher in high-CO2 plants when based on leaf area, but the same when based on dry weight. The rate of carbon export via the phloem was the same during the daytime in plants grown at 350 mu l l(-1) and 700 mu l l(-1) CO2. During the night the low-CO2 plants had only 50% of the daytime export rate, in contrast to the high-CO2 plants which maintained the high export rate.

The latter may be problematic because air trapped in polar ice caps indicates that atmospheric CO2 has fluctuated significantly over at least the past 400,000 yr, and likely the last 1.6 million yr, Three other points indicate potential biases for vegetation-based climate proxies. First, C-3-plant physiological research shows that the processes that determine growth optima in plants (photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, photorespiration) are all highly CO2-dependent, and thus were likely affected by the lower CO2 levels of the last glacial maximum. Second, the ratio of carbon assimilation per unit transpiration (called water-use efficiency) is sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2 through effects on stomatal conductance and may have altered C-3-plant responses to drought, Third, leaf gas- exchange experiments indicate that the response of plants to carbon-depleting environmental stresses are strengthened under low CO2 relative to today. This paper reviews the scope of research addressing the consequences of low atmospheric CO2 for plant and ecosystem processes and highlights why consideration of the physiological effects of low atmospheric CO2 on plant function is recommended for any future refinements to pollen- based palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

The sweetgum trees were naturally established in a 15-year-old forest dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Measurements were made in early June and late August 1997 during the first full year of CO2 fumigation in the Duke Forest FACE experiment. Sun leaves had a 68% greater leaf mass per unit area, 63% more leaf N per unit leaf area, 27% more chlorophyll per unit leaf area and 77% greater light-saturated photosynthetic rates than shade leaves. Elevated CO2 strongly stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis of sun and shade leaves in June and August; however, the relative photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 for sun leaves was mon than double the relative enhancement of shade leaves. Elevated CO2 stimulated apparent quantum yield by 30%. but there was no interaction between CO2 and leaf position. Daytime leaf-level carbon gain extrapolated from photosynthetic light response curves indicated that sun leaves were enhanced 98% by elevated CO2, whereas shade leaves were enhanced 41%. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect leaf N per unit area in sun or shade leaves during either measurement period. Thus, the greater CO2 enhancement of light-saturated photosynthesis in sun leaves than in shade leaves was probably a result of a greater amount of nitrogen per unit leaf area in sun leaves.

Carr.) from two provenances, at 53.2 degrees N (Skidegate a and Skidegate b) and at 41.3 degrees N (North Bend a and North Bend b), were grown near Edinburgh (55.5 degrees N), U.K., for three growing seasons in ambient (similar to 350 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (similar to 700 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentrations under conditions of non-limiting water and nutrient supply. Bud phenology was not affected by elevated [CO2] in the second growing season, but in the third year, the duration of shoot extension growth in three of the four clones (North Bend clones and Skidegate a) was significantly shortened, because of the suppression of lammas growth. Saplings in elevated [CO2] had significantly greater dry masses of all components than saplings in ambient [CO2]. However, comparison of relative component dry masses between plants of similar size showed no effect of [CO2] treatment on plant allometric relationships. This finding, and the observed suppression of lammas growth by high [CO2] during the third growing season suggests that the main effect of increasing [CO2] is to accelerate sapling development. Clonal provenance did not affect dry mass production in ambient [CO2]. However in elevated [CO2] the more southerly clones significantly out-performed the more northerly clones when grown at a latitude close to the latitudinal provenance of the Skidegate clones. As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration rises, such changes in the relative performance of genotypes may be exploited for economic gain through appropriate selection of provenances for forest plantings.2377^2^Centritto,M^Jarvis,P G^1999^1^Long-term effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentration and provenance on four clones of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis).

The clones were grown in stress-free conditions (adequate nutrition and water) to assess the effect of elevated [CO2] on tree physiology. Growth in elevated [CO2] significantly increased instantaneous photosynthetic rates of the clonal Sitka spruce saplings by about 62%. Downward acclimation of photosynthesis (A) was found in all four clones grown in elevated [CO2]. Rubisco activity and total chlorophyll concentration were also significantly reduced in elevated [CO2]. Provenance did not influence photosynthetic capacity. Best-fit estimates of J(max) (maximum rate of electron transport), V-cmax (RuBP-saturated rate of Rubisco) and A(max) (maximum rate of assimilation) were derived from responses of A to intercellular [CO2] by using the model of Farquharetal.(1980). At any leaf N concentration, the photosynthetic parameters were reduced by growth in elevated [CO2]. However, the ratio between J(max) and V-cmax was unaffected by CO2 growth concentration, indicating a tight coordination in the allocation of N between thylakoid and soluble proteins. In elevated [CO2] the more southerly clones had a higher initial N use efficiency (more carbon assimilated per unit of leaf N) than the more northerly clones, so that they had more N available for those processes or organs that were most limiting to growth at a particular time. This may explain the initial higher growth stimulation by elevated [CO2] in the North Bend clones than in the Skidegate clones.2378^4^Kellogg,E A^Farnsworth,E J^Russo,E T^Bazzaz,F^1999^1^Growth responses of C-4 grasses of contrasting origin to elevated CO2^52^84^3^279-288^^^^^Sep^^^^^7515312^344^3449^3450^376^384^386^417^685^813^um rate of assimilation) were deriA^7514^Nine grass species representing three independent origins of the C-4 photosynthetic pathway were grown at ambient (350 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2 and were harvested after flowering. Setaria and Arundinella are both members of the subfamily Panicoideae, and represent a single origin of the pathway. Aristida and Stipagrostis are sister genera in the subfamily Aristidoideae (formerly classified in subfamily Arundinoideae), and represent a second origin. Sporobolus, a member of the subfamily Chloridoideae, represents the third. By investigating two genera each within Panicoideae and Aristidoideae, we test the hypothesis that genera sharing the same origin of C-4 respond similarly. To explore variation among congeneric species, five species of Setaria were also examined to test the hypothesis that congeneric species have similar responses. Plant height and numbers of tillers, branches and inflorescences were measured, both over time and at final harvest. Biomass of roots, shoots, and inflorescences was also measured. Members of the Aristidoideae were generally significantly larger in elevated CO2, as indicated by measurements of biomass and plant height, whereas representatives of the Panicoideae varied considerably in their response. The two subfamilies differed significantly in their responses to elevated CO2 and this effect outweighed any effect of CO2 alone. Sporobolus, though equally distantly related to Panicoideae and Aristidoideae, had a CO2 response similar to that of some panicoid species. Even within the genus Setaria, some species were significantly smaller at elevated than at ambient CO2, whereas others were larger. This may reflect diversity in internal regulation rather than acclimation or changes in source-sink allocation of carbon. The variation complicates any prediction of responses of C-4 plants to future atmospheric change. Comparison of closely related species, however, may well lead to intriguing new insights into how regulatory pathways of CO2 assimilation are modified during evolution.

We examined whether an Australian temperate pasture grass (Danthonia richardsonii) grown in sand culture and supplied solely with virtually insoluble Al- and Fe-phosphate was able to increase C-gain when exposed to elevated (731 mu mol mol(-1)) compared with ambient (379 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentrations. When supplied with 8 mg kg(-1) insoluble P concentration, total citrate efflux by root systems (mu mol h(-1)), plant P uptake, shoot photosynthesis rates and plant mass were all significantly greater at elevated than at ambient CO2 after a growth period of between 55 and 63 days. In this treatment, although the P concentration of the rooting medium limited growth at ambient CO2, elevated CO2 increased P-uptake from the non-labile source, increased photosynthesis rates per unit shoot soluble-P and increased plant mass. At P concentrations lower than 8 mg kg(-1), plant mass, specific citrate efflux and maximum leaf carboxylation rates were limited by the amount of P available in the rooting medium and no CO2 effect was observed. In all treatments, carbon supply did not appear to limit citrate efflux. Where an increase in P uptake at elevated CO2 was achieved, it was due to an increase in root mass (indicative of a potentially larger soil volume explored) rather than to increased specific rates of citrate efflux. Above 8 mg kg(-1), the supplied P concentration was sufficient that minimal rates of specific citrate efflux alone solubilised enough P for growth and a strong CO2 effect on plant mass, photosynthesis and P uptake was observed.2380^5^Oltchev,A^Ibrom,A^Morgenstern,K^Kreilein,H^Gravenhorst,G^1999^1^Evaluation of the response of a spruce forest ecosystem on climatic changes: Results of modelling experiments^379^24^1-2^103-110^^^^^^^^^^7519349^377^425^nthesis rates per unit shoot soluble-P and A^7518^The physical and chemical environment of forests will change in the future. How forests will react to new conditions is not known yet. In order to get an idea of the sensitivity of present forests to possible atmospheric changes, it is helpful to investigate the physiological response of forest ecosystem to a change of key environmental parameters. In order to estimate the response of a mountain spruce forest to different atmospheric conditions during the summer a six-layer non- steady-state SVAT model (SLODSVAT) was used Eight scenarios were used for modelling energy and mass exchange during an eleven day summer period, combining different combinations of microclimatic conditions. All atmospheric scenarios were examined for three various CO2 mixing ratio levels: 350ppm (current condition), 450ppm and 550ppm. A scenario "0" assuming the current climatic features at different CO2 contents was considered as well. Structural and physiological adaptation of the forest to the new atmospheric conditions were not taken into account. For all scenarios the modelling results show increased net CO2 flux into the forest with increasing ambient CO2 concentration. Maximum net CO2 uptake was simulated for dry climate scenarios. Transpiration and evapotranspiration rates had similar trends independently of the ambient CO2 concentration used: at cold and wet conditions they decreased, while at warm and dry conditions transpiration and evapotranspiration rates increased The influence of CO2 concentrations on transpiration rates is of minor importance if compared to changes of temperature, water vapour pressure, cloud amount and atmospheric precipitation as considered in this investigation.

In 1995 we mapped the location of both earthworm surface casts and plants in each of 16 1.2-m(2) plots in a species-rich calcareous grassland in northwestern Switzerland. Eight plots have been maintained under current ambient CO2 concentrations (350 mu L CO2/ L), and eight have been maintained at elevated CO2 (600 mu L CO2/L) since March 1994. in addition, total ramet production of each species, as a measure of performance, and cumulative cast production at each location (cell) were recorded at peak community biomass in 1995. Plant species within functional groups (graminoids, non- legume forbs, and legumes) differed markedly in their degree of association with casts; however, after two growing seasons elevated CO2 had no effect on plant species or functional group associations with casts. No statistically significant relationship could be demonstrated between plant-species response (i.e., ramet production) to elevated CO2 and the degree of association with casts within any of the functional groups. However, a positive relationship was observed between the mean response of graminoid species to elevated CO2 (measured as the percentage change in mean total ramet production of graminoid species, relative to mean total ramet production at ambient CO2) and their mean degree of association (%) with surface casts at ambient CO2. Thus, graminoid species more frequently associated with casts (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carer caryophyllea) produced more ramets per square meter at elevated CO2 than those less frequently associated with casts (e.g., Agrostis tenuis and Danthonia decumbens). These results, along with the strong and significant positive correlations observed between ramet production and associated cumulative cast mass across CO2 treatments for most plant species in all functional groups demonstrate: (1) that plant species differ significantly in their degree of association with nutrient-rich earthworm surface casts, regardless of the relative abundance of plant species in the community; (2) that graminoid species that are more highly associated with casts may respond more strongly to rising CO2 than those less highly associated with casts; and (3) that nutrient-rich earthworm casts stimulate the growth (ramet production) of most plant species in these grassland communities, even at current levels of atmospheric CO2.

Further, models of land-use change are included. Additionally, global multiple sector models of environment, natural resources, human population dynamics, economics, energy, and political relations are reviewed for integrated impact assessment. To the extent available, information on computer software and hardware requirements is presented for the various models. The paper concludes with comments about using these technologies as they relate to ecological risk assessment for policy decision analysis. Such an effort is hampered by considerable uncertainties with the output of existing models, because of the uncertainties associated with input data and the definitions of their dose-response relationships. The concluding suggestions point the direction for new developments in modeling and analyses that are needed for the 21st century. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Plants were grown for 60 d in sand, using nutrient solutions (six nitrate concentrations from 0.25 to 16 mM NO3), at ambient (c. 357 mu l l(-1)) or elevated CO2 (c. 712 mu l l(-1)). Species dominance in the mixtures depended more on the range of N than of CO2 concentration provided: T. repens and L. pedunculatus dominated at low concentrations of N; L. pedunculatus and P. aquatica performed better at high concentrations. Responses of species in mixtures to CO2 were related to their responses in monocultures but not to those of isolated plants. Species biomass proportions in mixtures under ambient CO2 determined the outcome of mixture responses to CO2 more than of individual species responses to CO2. These results emphasize the influence of plant-plant interactions on community responses to CO2, since mixture behaviour under elevated CO2 could not be scaled-up from responses by isolated plants in this experiment.2388^2^Roberntz,P^Linder,S^1999^1^Effects of long-term CO2 enrichment and nutrient availability in Norway spruce.

Karst.] were exposed to ambient (AMB) or ambient plus 350 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) (EL) for 4 years (except winters), using the branch bag technique (BB). The trees were growing on plots with low (control) and high (irrigated-fertilised) availability of soil nutrients. The seasonal variation in foliar macronutrients and non-structural carbohydrates in current and 1-year-old shoots was monitored throughout the treatment period. When the branches were harvested at the end of treatment, macronutrients were analysed in five age classes of foliage. The concentration of all elements, except magnesium, generally increased in AMB, i.e. a 'bag effect', but decreased as an effect of EL, i.e. a 'CO2 effect'. At the final harvest K, P, N and S were reduced in young needles by EL, whereas Mg was reduced in older needles on both plots. A change in needle morphology by EL possibly caused a dilution effect in irrigated-fertilised needles, but not in control needles. Reductions in K and Mg are suggested to be an effect of increased phloem transport from the branch, in consequence of higher rates of carbon fixation in EL. Foliage in BBs had higher concentration of Ca, but there was no significant effect of the EL-treatment, indicating that elevated CO2 had no effect on stomatal conductance. Quinic acid concentration decreased, but shikimic acid concentration increased in BBs, independently of CO2 treatment. Concentrations of starch and sugars increased in the EL- treatment, but pinitol decreased.2389^4^Herbert,D A^Rastetter,E B^Shaver,G R^Agren,G I^1999^1^Effects of plant growth characteristics on biogeochemistry and community composition in a changing climate^356^2^4^367-382^^^^^Jul-Aug^^^^^7537146^1895^3468^3469^374^57^715^737^795^892^ P, N and S were reduced in young needles by EL, whereas Mg was reduced in older needles on both plots.

We used a multiple-element limitation model (MEL) to examine how variations in nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and net primary production to biomass ratio (nPBR) affect changes in ecosystem C stocks after an increase in temperature and atmospheric CO2. nPBR influences the initial rates of response, but the magnitude and direction of long-term responses are determined NUE. MEL was used to simulate responses to climate change in communities composed of two species differing in nPBR and/or NUE. When only nPBR differed between the species, the high-nPBR species outgrew the low-nPBR species early in the simulations, but the shift in dominance was transitory because of secondary N limitations. High-NUE and were therefore favored under elevated CO2. Increased temperature stimulated N release from soil organic matter (SOM) and therefore favored low-NUE species. The combined release from C and N limitation under the combination of increased temperature and elevated CO2 favored high-NUE species. High C:N litter from high-NUE species limited the N-supply rate from SOM, which favors the dominance of the high-NUE species in the short term. However, in the long term increased litter production resulted in SOM accumulation, which reestablished a N supply rate favorable to the reestablishment and dominance of the low-NUE species. Conditions then reverted to a state favorable to the high-NUE species.2390^2^Matsueda,H^Inoue,H Y^1999^1^Aircraft measurements of trace gases between Japan and Singapore in October of 1993, 1996, and 1997^65^26^16^2413-2416^^^^^15 Aug^^^^^7539176^3470^3471^3472^3473^3474^3475^3476^3477^893^mulations, but the shift in dominance was transitory because of secondary N limitations.

Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), in- vitro digestibility, initial rates of gas evolution las an indicator of the initial rates of fermentation of the substrate), volatile fatty acid evolution, and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) levels were determined in leaves, stems and roots at full flowering. Under control conditions (average midsummer conditions in the United Kingdom) the total condensed tannin content of leaves varied six-fold between genotypes but condensed tannin contents in stems and roots were similar. Condensed tannin levels were significantly increased in leaves and stems of all three genotypes by doubling the CO2 concentration while raising the temperature towards the optimum for growth significantly reduced condensed tannin levels. Drought stress significantly reduced condensed tannin levels in leaves and, particularly, in roots. Nutritive value was inversely related to condensed tannin levels in leaves and a negative relationship was observed between condensed tannin concentrations of more than 25-30 g kg(-1) dry matter and the initial rates of gas evolution when subjected to in-vitro fermentation with rumen micro-organisms. In leaves, digestibility was significantly increased by drought and by increasing temperature but reduced by high CO2. In stems, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, but not significantly affected by increasing temperature, or by high CO2 alone. In roots, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, and decreased by increasing temperature or CO2. Increasing the growth temperature towards optimum growth reduced the content of NSC in all tissues with the greatest changes occurring in root tissue. Doubling the CO2 concentration increased NSC levels in leaves and stems with starch content more than doubled under high CO2 while, in roots, increased levels were only observed in combination with drought stress. There was a linear correlation between condensed tannin concentration and total NSC that was positive for leaves, neutral for stems and negative for roots. The relationship between carbohydrate levels and rates of gas production was negative for leaves and positive for stem and roots.

(pineapple) was grown at three day/night temperatures and 350 (ambient) and 700 (elevated) mu mol mol(-1) CO2 to examine the interactive effects of these factors on leaf gas exchange and stable carbon isotope discrimination (Delta,parts per thousand). All data were collected on the youngest mature leaf for 24 h every 6 weeks. CO2 uptake (mmol m(-2) d(-1)) at ambient and elevated CO2, respectively, were 306 and 352 at 30/20 degrees C, 175 and 346 at 30/25 degrees C and 187 and 343 at 35/25 degrees C, CO2 enrichment enhanced CO2 uptake substantially in the day in all environments. Uptake at night at elevated CO2, relative to that at ambient CO2, was unchanged at 30/20 degrees C, but was 80% higher at 30/25 degrees C and 44% higher at 35/25 degrees C suggesting that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was not CO2- saturated at ambient CO2 levels and a 25 degrees C night temperature. Photosynthetic water use efficiency (WUE) was higher at elevated than at ambient CO2. Leaf Delta-values were higher at elevated than at ambient CO2 due to relatively higher assimilation in the light, Leaf Delta was significantly and linearly related to the fraction of total CO2 assimilated at night. The data suggest that a simultaneous increase in CO2 level and temperature associated with global warming would enhance carbon assimilation, increase WUE, and reduce the temperature dependence of CO2 uptake by A. comosus.2393^4^Hymus,G J^Ellsworth,D S^Baker,N R^Long,S P^1999^1^Does free-air carbon dioxide enrichment affect photochemical energy use by evergreen trees in different seasons?

The hypothesis was developed and tested that elevated CO2 increases photochemical energy use when there is a high demand for assimilates and decreases usage when demand is low. Modulated chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf gas exchange were measured on needles at the top of a mature, 12-m loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest. Trees were exposed to ambient CO2 or ambient plus 20 Pa CO2 using free-air CO2 enrichment. During April and August, periods of shoot growth, light-saturated photosynthesis and linear electron transport were increased by elevated CO2. In November, when growth had ceased but temperatures were still moderate, CO2 treatment had no significant effect on linear electron transport. In February, when low temperatures were likely to inhibit translocation, CO2 treatment caused a significant decrease in linear electron transport. This coincided with a slower recovery of the maximum photosystem II efficiency on transfer of needles to the shade, indicating that growth in elevated CO2 induced a more persistent photoinhibition. Both the summer increase and the winter decrease in linear electron transport in elevated CO2 resulted from a change in photochemical quenching, not in the efficiency of energy transfer within the photosystem II antenna. There was no evidence of any effect of CO2 on photochemical energy sinks other than carbon metabolism. Our results suggest that elevated CO2 may increase the effects of winter stress on evergreen foliage.2394^3^van Oene,H^Berendse,F^de Kovel,C G F^1999^1^Model analysis of the effects of historic CO2 levels and nitrogen inputs on vegetation succession^56^9^3^920-935^^^^^Aug^^^^^75471660^227^2285^312^3485^372^600^669^672^92^linear electron transport.

The effects of such abiotic changes on ecosystem variables such as nitrogen mineralization and carbon accumulation can affect plant species composition, which in turn may affect various ecosystem processes. However, these interacting effects of plant species composition on ecosystem processes and vice versa are often not included in simulation models. In this paper, a model is developed that includes both plant competition and the flows of nutrients, carbon, and water through the ecosystem. Direct effects of changing atmospheric CO2 on biomass, plant nitrogen concentrations, and litter quantity and quality are simulated together with indirect effects through changes in plant species composition. This model is validated against data from a primary succession chronosequence sere of Dutch inland dunes. For this validation, historical N deposition and atmospheric CO2 concentration records are used. Simulated plant species biomass, organic matter C and N, and total C and N accumulation were found to correspond to measured data. The model simulated plant species replacement well at the different sites of the chronosequence even though the historic conditions differed much between the sites. Additional analyses of the effect of N deposition (preindustrial to present-day) and elevated CO2 (preindustrial to present-day) in this ecosystem showed that N deposition had a strong effect both on vegetation development and on C and N accumulation. Compared to this, the stimulating effects of elevated CO2 on vegetation development were relatively small. Elevated CO2 affected early vegetation development, but the long-term response of vegetation development is dependent on N availability. In old mature forest, N deposition had only small effects while elevated CO2 delayed forest aging. Indirect effects of CO2 on C and N accumulation through changing plant competitive relations may ultimately be larger than direct CO2 effects.2395^5^Niewiadomska,E^Gaucher-Veilleux,C^Chevrier,N^Mauffette,Y^Dizengremel,P^1999^1^Elevated CO2 does not provide protection against ozone considering the activity of several antioxidant enzymes in the leaves of sugar maple^4^155^1^70-77^^^^^Jul^^^^^75491064^1677^2125^2369^2473^2938^3033^312^3486^417^f the effect of N deposition (preindustrial to present-day) and elevated CO2 (preindustrial to present-day) in this ecosystem showed that N deposition had a strong effect both on vegetation development and on C and N accumulation.

However, at ambient [CO2], leaves with a high leaf dry mass per unit area usually have low leaf hi per unit dry mass. Whether the changes in leaf properties induced by elevated [CO2] follow the same overall pattern as that at ambient [CO2] has not previously been addressed. Here we address this issue by using leaf measurements made at ambient [CO2] to develop an empirical model of the composition and morphology of leaves. Predictions from that model are then compared with a global database of leaf measurements made at ambient [CO2]. Those predictions are also compared with measurements showing the impact of elevated [CO2]. In the empirical model both the leaf dry mass and liquid mass per unit area are positively correlated with leaf thickness, whereas the mass of C per unit dry mass and the mass of N per unit liquid mass are constant. Consequently, both the N:C ratio and the surface area:volume ratio of leaves are positively correlated with the liquid content. Predictions from that model were consistent with measurements of leaf properties made at ambient [CO2] from around the world. The changes induced by elevated [CO2] follow the same overall trajectory. It is concluded that elevated [CO2] enhances the rate at which dry matter is accumulated but the overall trajectory of leaf development is conserved.2398^3^Roumet,C^Laurent,G^Roy,J^1999^1^Leaf structure and chemical composition as affected by elevated CO2: genotypic responses of two perennial grasses^84^143^1^73-81^^^^^Jul^^^^^75551304^1380^2087^2346^2601^312^344^376^791^975^O2].

Fourteen genotypes of each species were grown together on intact soil monoliths at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (350 and 700 mu mol mol(-1), respectively).

Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment I, L. minor was treated for 15 d with a cumulative O-3 exposure of 14.4 ppm.h. No O-3 effects were observed during Experiment I. Dry weight of individual fronds and photosynthesis per frond increased in L minor exposed to 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)(-) air. In Experiment II after 25 d of treatment (cumulative O-3 exposure of 16.2 ppm h), negative effects of 2XO(3) on the photosynthetic and growth rates of L. minor were observed. Dark respiration of L minor significantly increased in 2XO(3)-air compared with controls, but declined significantly in 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air compared to those grown in 2XO(3)-air. Photosynthesis and drg weight per frond increased in 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air when compared with all other treatments. Measurement of A/C-i (assimilation versus intercellular CO2 concentration) curves in L. minor showed a significant reduction in carboxylation efficiency and maximum rates of photosynthesis in 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air compared with other treatments when expressed per weight. No differences in carboxylation efficiency were detected between treatments when expressed per frond. After 25 d of treatment, photosynthesis (per frond) and dry weight of S. polyrhiza were reduced in 2XO(3)-air, but final frond number was unaffected. Dark respiration of S. polyrhiza was unaffected in 2XO(3)(-) air, but when exposed to 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air, it declined significantly. Although S. polyrhiza photosynthesis per frond increased in 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air, dry weight was unaffected when compared with all other treatments. Only when comparisons were made between S. polyrhiza grown in 2XCO(2)+2XO(3)-air and 2XO(3)-air, were significant increases in dry weight observed.

Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities in leaf extracts at 21, 48 and 81 days after planting (DAP) were assayed under saturating and selective (limiting) conditions. Diel SPS activity data indicated that rice SPS was light regulated; with up to 2.2-fold higher rates during the day. Throughout the growth season, leaf SPS activities were up-regulated in the CO2-enriched plants, averaging 20 and 12% higher than in ambient-CO2 grown plants in selective and saturating assays, respectively. Similarly, SPS activities increased 2.4% for each 1 degrees C rise in growth temperature from 25 to 34 degrees C, but decreased 11.5% at 37 degrees C. Leaf sucrose content was higher, and mirrored SPS activity better, than starch, although starch was more responsive to CO2 treatment. Leaf sucrose and starch contents were significantly higher throughout the season in plants at elevated CO2, but the N content averaged 6.5% lower. Increasing growth temperatures from 25 to 37 degrees C caused a linear decrease (62%) in leaf starch content, but not in sucrose. Consequently, the starch:sucrose ratio declined with growth temperature. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the up-regulation of leaf SPS may be an acclimation response of rice to optimize the utilization and export of organic-C with the increased rates of inorganic-C fixation in elevated CO2 or temperature growth regimes.2402^6^Santruckova,H^Santrucek,J^Kveton,J^Simkova,M^Elhottova,D^Rohacek,K^1999^1^Carbon balance of a winter wheat-root microbiota system under elevated CO2^79^36^3^341-354^^^^^^^^^^75631334^1364^243^344^374^376^384^407^57^92^rees C, but decreased 11.5% at 37 degrees C.

Net photosynthesis (P-N) and respiration (R-D) rates of roots and shoots were measured continuously, plant growth and carbon distribution in the plant-root medium-associated microorganism system were determined destructively in interval-based analyses. P-N in elevated CO2 grown plants (EC) was 123 % of that in the control (AC) plants when averaged over the whole life span (39-d-old plants, 34 d in EC), but the percentage varied with the developmental stage being 115, 88, and 167 % in the pretillering, tillering, and posttillering phase, respectively. There was a transient depression of P-N, higher amplitude of day/night fluctuations of the chloroplast starch content, and depression of carbon content in rhizosphere of EC plants during the period of tillering. After 34 d in EC, carbon content in shoots,'roots, and in rhizodepositions was enhanced by the factors 1.05, 1.28, and 1.96, respectively. Carbon partitioning between above and belowground biomass was not affected by EC, however, proportionally more C in the belowground partitioning was allocated into the root biomass, Carbon flow from roots to rhizodepositions and rhizosphere microflora was proportional to P-N; its fraction in daily assimilated carbon decreased from young (17 %) to older (3-4 %) plants.2403^2^Coviella,C E^Trumble,J T^1999^1^Effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on insect-plant interactions^106^13^4^700-712^^^^^Aug^^^^^75651081^1089^1282^137^3186^3492^3493^3494^483^857^ stage being 115, 88, and 167 % in the pretillering, tillering, and posttillering phase, respectively.

Several scenarios can be predicted however. (1) local extinctions will occur; (2) the endangered species status as well as the pest status of some insect species will change; (3) geographic distributions for some insect species will shift with host-plant ranges; and (4) changes in the population dynamics of affected insect species will influence their interactions with other insects and plants. For insect conservation purposes, it is critical to begin long-term studies on the effects of enhanced CO2 levels on insect populations. An analysis of the available literature indicates that many orders containing insect species important for ecosystem conservation, and even those important as agricultural or medical pests, have not been examined.

F144 was investigated under both saline and non-saline conditions. Tomato seedlings were grown in hydroponic culture (pH 6.5) with or without NaCl, and the root solution was aerated with either ambient CO2 (360 mol mol(-1)) or CO2- enriched air (5000 mu mol mol(-1)). Nitrate uptake and root tissue NO3- concentrations were increased slightly by elevated rhizosphere DIC concentrations in both control and salinity- treated plants. This is associated with 46% higher nitrate reductase activity in the roots of control plants supplied with elevated DIC than in those supplied with ambient DIG. The activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) in vitro in control and salinity-treated plants was unaffected by the supply of elevated rhizosphere DIC concentrations. However, PEPc activity in vitro was considerably higher than the rates of PEPc activity in vivo reported previously, indicating that PEPc activity was not in itself a limitation on the provision of anaplerotic C. Therefore elevated DIC concentration in the rhizosphere stimulated the uptake of NO3- and provided alternative C skeletons for the assimilation of the NH4+ resulting from NO3- reduction into amino acids within the roots. Salinity stimulated root glutamine synthetase (GS) activity up to double that in control plants. Furthermore, elevated DIC caused an increase in leaf and root GS activity of control plants while inhibiting GS activity in the roots of salinity-treated plants. Glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) activity of salinity-treated plants was doubled by elevated rhizosphere DIC concentrations. These changes in GS and GOGAT activity must reflect changes in amino acid synthesis.

We examined the effect of elevated CO2 (590 mu l l(- 1)) at two nutrient (NPK) levels on the interactions of the facultative root hemiparasite Rhinanthus alectorolophus with two of its hosts, the grass Lolium perenne and the legume Medicago sativa. To study possible effects on parasite mediation of competition between hosts, the parasite was grown with each host separately and with both hosts simultaneously. In addition, all combinations of hosts were grown without the parasite. Both the parasite and the host plants responded to elevated CO2 with increased growth, but only at high nutrient levels. The CO2 response of the hemiparasite was stronger than that of the hosts, but depended on the host species available. With L. perenne and M. sativa simultaneously available as hosts, the biomass of the parasite grown at elevated CO2 was 5.7 times that of parasites grown at ambient CO2. Nitrogen concentration in the parasites was not influenced by the treatments and was not related to parasite biomass. The presence of the parasite strongly reduced both the biomass of the hosts and total productivity of the system. This effect was much stronger at low than at high nutrient levels, but was not influenced by CO2 level. Elevated CO2 did not influence the competitive balance between the two different hosts grown in mixture. The results of this study support the hypothesis that hemiparasites may influence community structure and suggest that these effects are robust to changes in CO2 concentration.2407^3^Muschak,M^Willmitzer,L^Fisahn,J^1999^1^Gas-exchange analysis of chloroplastic fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase antisense potatoes at different air humidities and at elevated CO2^6^209^1^104-111^^^^^Jul^^^^^75731538^1754^1783^2185^243^3113^312^3498^383^92^tiva simultaneously available as hosts, the biomass of the parasite grown at eA^7572^Gas-exchange measurements were performed to analyze the leaf conductances and assimilation rates of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv.

Assimilation rates (A) and transpiration rates (E) were observed during a stepwise increase of photon flux density. These experiments were carried out under atmospheric conditions and in air containing 500 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. In both gas atmospheres, two levels of relative air humidity (60- 70% and 70-80%) were applied in different sets of measurements. Intercellular CO2 concentration, leaf conductance, air-to-leaf vapour pressure deficit, and instantaneous water-use efficiency (A/E) were determined. As expected, assimilation rates of the FBPase antisense plants were significantly reduced as compared to the wild type. Saturation of assimilation rates in transgenic plants occurred at a photon flux density of 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas saturation in wild type plants was observed at 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

These differences in leaf conductance vanished at elevated levels of ambient CO2. Stomatal response to different relative air humidities was not affected by mesophyll photosynthetic activity.

Such model predictions are largely untested in the field, for lack of experimental data. We tested the CERES-Wheat model, modified to include leaf-level photosynthesis response to elevated CO2, using field data from 2 yr of Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yecora Rojo) in Mariclopa, AZ. Two irrigation treatments (well-watered, WW; water-deficit stressed, WS) and two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient, 350 mu mol mol(-1); elevated, 550 mu mol mol(-1)) were simulated. The model was evaluated using measurements of crop phenology, aboveground dry matter (DM) production, grain yield, and evapotranspiration (ET). Model calculations of crop phenology were within 2 to 3 d of observed values under WW, ambient CO2 conditions in both years. The model did not simulate the accelerated crop phenology (5-8 d at physiological maturity) observed in the WW and elevated CO2 treatments, indicating the need to include effects of increased stomatal resistance on canopy temperature. Simulations of DM and grain yield were within 10% of measured values, except for a tendency to overcalculate DM response to CO2 by 10 to 15% in Year 1 for WS treatments. The model undercalculated cumulative ET under WW conditions by 15%; model sensitivity analyses suggest that simulation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was too low for this arid site. The model reproduced measured dynamics of CO2-water interactions. Simulated reductions in water loss due to elevated CO2 were about 4%, in agreement with measurements. The model simulated larger increases in DM production and yield due to elevated CO2 under WS than under WW conditions.

Growth at elevated CO2 resulted in reductions in apparent Rubisco activity in vivo in all three species, which were associated with reductions of total leaf nitrogen content on a unit area basis for A. capillaris and L. perenne. Despite this acclimation, photosynthesis was significantly higher at elevated CO2 for T. repens and A. capillaris, the latter exhibiting the greatest increase of carbon uptake at the lowest nutrient supply. 3.

Evolutionary responses to climate change will depend on the presence of heritable variation within species populations for traits that increase fitness under the changing conditions. Patterns of ecotypic differentiation in relation to latitude in some species suggest that such variation exists in relation to temperature responses. Response to elevated CO2, whether heritable or not, is not expected to be related to latitudinal or climatic differences within temperate regions. 2. To test these ideas, seeds were collected from 10 populations of the outbreeding perennial grass Agrostis curtisii across its range in Europe from south Wales to Portugal. Plants were grown under ambient and elevated temperature and CO2 conditions, in a factorial design, in solardomes; two half sibs from each population were planted in separate pots in each of the two replicate domes with each combination of treatments. One half sib was harvested at the end of the first summer, the second at the end of the second summer. 3. Survival was uniformly high and flowering uniformly low across treatments and populations. 4. Responses to temperature and CO2 treatments varied over time for almost all populations. Treatment effects were not significant on plants harvested in year 1, although there was a trend towards higher shoot biomass under the elevated temperature and CO2 treatment. Tn year 2 shoot biomass was significantly higher under the elevated temperature treatment across all populations and there was a strong trend towards decreased biomass under elevated CO2 5. There were no significant correlations of plant response to either CO2 or temperature with climate at origin. 6.

We investigated the effects of high CO2 (570 compared with 370 mu mol mol(-1)) with and without an increased nutrient supply (a combined N, P, K application) on the growth and physiology of bracken, growing in containers in controlled-environment glasshouses, over two full growing seasons. Results of growth and physiology determinations are reported for the second season. 2. Elevated CO2 had little impact on the growth or allocation of dry mass in bracken. No significant changes were detected in dry mass of the total plant or any of the organs: rhizomes, roots and fronds. In contrast to the small effects of high CO2 the high nutrient treatment caused a three-fold stimulation of total plant dry mass and an increase in the allocation of dry mass to above ground when compared with low nutrient controls. 3. Net photosynthetic rates in saturating light were increased by both high CO2 and nutrient treatments, particularly in spring months (May and June). Growth in elevated CO2 did not cause a down- regulation in light-saturated rates of photosynthesis. The increased carbon gain in the high CO2 treatments was accompanied, in the low-nutrient plants, by higher concentrations of carbohydrates. However, in high-nutrient plants the CO2 treatment did not cause an accumulation of carbohydrates. The absence of a growth response to elevated CO2 in bracken despite significant increases in photosynthesis requires further investigation.2415^3^Centritto,M^Lee,H S J^Jarvis,P G^1999^1^Increased growth in elevated [CO2]: an early, short-term response?^127^5^6^623-633^^^^^Aug^^^^^75891344^1985^2060^243^2601^310^344^360^427^740^f high CO2 the high nutrient treatment caused a three-fold stimulation of total plant dry mass and an increase in the allocation of dry mass to above ground when compared with low nutrient controls. 3.

Classical growth analysis was applied to both species and mean current relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T) and leaf dry mass (R-L), and period relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T(t)) and leaf dry mass (R-L(t)) were calculated. Sitka spruce saplings and cherry seedlings showed a positive growth response to elevated [CO2], and at the end of the experiments both species were approximate to 40% larger in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. As a result, the period mean R-T(t) and R-L(t) were significantly higher in elevated [CO2]. The differences in plant dry mass at the end of the experiments were a consequence of the more rapid growth in the early phase of exposure to elevated [CO2]. After this initial phase mean R-T and R-L were similar or even lower in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. NAR of both species was much higher in elevated [CO2], whereas both LAR, SLA, and LMR showed the opposite trend. The higher LAR and SLA of plants in ambient [CO2] contributed to a compensation by which they maintained R- T Similar to that of elevated [CO2] saplings despite lower NAR and photosynthetic rate. However, when the same size the trees were similar amongst the [CO2] treatments, indicating that one of the main effect of elevated [CO2] on tree growth is to speed-up early development in all aspects.2416^5^Paterson,E^Hodge,A^Thornton,B^Millard,P^Killham,K^1999^1^Carbon partitioning and rhizosphere C-flow in Lolium perenne as affected by CO2 concentration, irradiance and below-ground conditions^127^5^6^669-678^^^^^Aug^^^^^75912032^2508^3503^362^374^376^436^57^733^92^ass at the end of the experiments were a consequence of the A^7590^Plant responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations have received considerable interest. However, major uncertainties in relation to interactive effects of CO2 with above- and below-ground conditions remain. This microcosm study investigated the impacts of CO2 concentration on plant growth, dry matter partitioning and rhizodeposition as affected by: (i) photon flux density (PFD), and (ii) growth matrix. Plants were grown in a sandy loam soil for 28 d under two photon flux densities: 350 (low PFD) and 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (high PFD) and two CO2 concentrations: 450 (low CO2) and 720 mu mol mol(- 1) (high CO2). Partitioning of recent assimilate amongst plant and rhizosphere C-pools was determined by use of (CO2)-C-14 pulse-labelling. In treatments with high PFD and/or high CO2, significant (P< 0.05) increases in dry matter production were found in comparison with the low PFD/low CO2 treatment. In addition, significant (P < 0.05) reductions in shoot %N and SLA were found in treatments imposing high PFD and/or high CO2. Root weight ratio (RWR) was unaffected by CO2 concentration, however, partitioning of C-14 to below ground pools was significantly (P< 0.05) increased. In a separate study, L. perenne was grown for 28 d in microcosms percolated with nutrient solution, in either a sterile sand matrix or nonsterile soil, under high or low CO2. Dry matter production was significantly (P< 0.01) increased for both sand and soil grown seedlings. Dry matter partitioning was affected by matrix type. C-14-allocation below ground was increased for sand grown plants. Rhizodeposition was affected by CO2 concentration for growth in each matrix, but was increased for plants grown in the soil matrix, and decreased for those in sand. The results illustrate that plant responses to CO2 are potentially affected by (i) PFD, and (ii) by feedbacks from the growth matrix.

We explored temperature acclimation of respiration in seedlings of tree species of the North American boreal forest. Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana, and Picea mariana plants were grown from seed in controlled-environments at current and elevated concentrations of CO2 (370 and 580 mu mol mol(-1)) in combination with three temperature treatments of 18/12, 24/18, and 30/24 degrees C (light/dark period). Specific respiration rates of roots and shoots acclimated to temperature, damping increases in rates across growth-temperature environments compared to short-term temperature responses. Compared at a standard temperature, root and shoot respiration rates were, on average, 40% lower in plants grown at the highest compared to lowest growth temperature. Broad-leaved species had a lower degree of temperature acclimation of respiration than did the conifers. Among species and treatment combinations, rates of respiration were linearly related to size and relative growth rate, and relationships were comparable among growth environments. Specific respiration rates and whole-plant respiratory CO2 efflux as a proportion of daily net CO2 uptake increased at higher growth temperatures, but were minimally affected by CO2 concentration. Whole-plant specific respiration rates were two to three times higher in broad-leaved than coniferous species. However, compared to faster-growing broad-leaved species, slower-growing conifers lost a larger proportion of net daily CO2 uptake as respiratory CO2 efflux, especially in roots.

These uncertainties have not yet been considered rigorously due to expectations of C4 low responsiveness based on photosynthetic theory and early experiments. We carried out a literature review (1980-97) and meta-analysis in order to identify emerging patterns of C4 grass responses to elevated CO2, as compared with those of C3 grasses. The focus was on nondomesticated Poaceae alone, to the exclusion of C4 dicotyledonous and C4 crop species. This provides a clear test, controlled for genotypic variability at family level, of differences between the CO2-responsiveness of these functional types. Eleven responses were considered, ranging from physiological behaviour at the leaf level to carbon allocation patterns at the whole plant level. Results were also assessed in the context of environmental stress conditions (light, temperature, water and nutrient stress), and experimental growing conditions (pot size, experimental duration and fumigation method). Both C4 and C3 species increased total biomass significantly in elevated CO2, by 33% and 44%, respectively. Differing tendencies between types in shoot structural response were revealed: C3 species showed a greater increase in tillering, whereas C4 species showed a greater increase in leaf area in elevated CO2. At the leaf level, significant stomatal closure and increased leaf water use efficiency were confirmed in both types, and higher carbon assimilation rates were found in both C3 and C4 species (33% and 25%, respectively). Environmental stress did not alter the C4 CO2-response, except for the loss of a significant positive CO2-response for above-ground biomass and leaf area under water stress. In C3 species, stimulation of carbon assimilation rate was reduced by stress (overall), and nutrient stress tended to reduce the mean biomass response to elevated CO2. Leaf carbohydrate status increased and leaf nitrogen concentration decreased significantly in elevated CO2 only in C3 species. We conclude that the relative responses of the C4 and C3 photosynthetic types to elevated CO2 concur only to some extent with expectations based on photosynthetic theory. The significant positive responses of C4 grass species at both the leaf and the whole plant level demand a re-evaluation of the assumption of low responsiveness in C4 plants at both levels, and not only with regard to water relations. The combined shoot structural and water use efficiency responses of these functional types will have consequential implications for the water balance of important catchments and range lands throughout the world, especially in semiarid subtropical and temperate regions.

Specific respiration rates partially acclimated to warmer thermal environments through downward adjustment in the intercept, but not Q(10) of the temperature-response functions. Temperature acclimation of respiration was larger for conifers than broad-leaved species and was associated with pronounced reductions in leaf nitrogen concentrations in conifers at higher growth temperatures. Shortterm increases in CO2 concentration did not inhibit respiration. Growth in the elevated CO2 concentration reduced leaf nitrogen and increased non-structural carbohydrate concentrations. However, for a given nitrogen concentration, respiration was higher in leaves grown in the elevated CO2 concentration, as rates increased with increasing carbohydrates, Across species and treatments, respiration rates were a function of both leaf nitrogen and carbohydrate concentrations (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.0001). Longterm acclimation of foliar dark respiration to temperature and CO2 concentration is largely associated with changes in nitrogen and carbohydrate concentrations.2420^3^Randerson,J T^Thompson,M V^Field,C B^1999^1^Linking C-13-based estimates of land and ocean sinks with predictions of carbon storage from CO2 fertilization of plant growth^257^51^3^668-678^^^^^Jul^^^^^75991660^1804^1859^1919^2762^344^3506^362^57^625^nounced reductions in leaf nitrogen concentrations in conifers at higher growth temperatures.

While C-13-based calculations of the land sink decline with increasing estimates of terrestrial carbon residence times (through the fossil fuel-induced isotopic disequilibrium term in equations describing the global atmospheric budgets of (CO2)-C-13 and CO2), estimates of land sinks based on CO2 fertilization of plant growth are directly proportional to carbon residence times. Here we used a single model of terrestrial carbon turnover, the Carnegie Ames- Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, to simultaneously estimate 1984-1990 terrestrial carbon storage using both approaches. Our goal was to identify the fraction of the (CO2)-C-13-based land sink attributable to CO2 fertilization. Uptake from CO2 fertilization was calculated using a beta factor of 0.46 to describe the response of NPP to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 from 1765 to 1990. Given commonly used parameters in the C-13-based sink calculation and assuming a deforestation flux of 0.8 Pg C/yr, CO2 fertilization accounts for 54% of the missing terrestrial carbon sink from 1984 to 1990. CO2 fertilization can account for all of the missing terrestrial sink only when the terrestrial mean residence time (MRT) and the land isodisequilibrium forcing are greater than many recent estimates.2421^3^Lovelock,C E^Posada,J^Winter,K^1999^1^Effects of elevated CO2 and defoliation on compensatory growth and photosynthesis of seedlings in a tropical tree, Copaifera aromatica^382^31^2^279-287^^^^^Jun^^^^^76011390^2072^2511^312^360^374^386^547^669^711^ously estimate 1984-1990 terrestrial carbon storage using both approaches.

Our aim was to determine whether compensatory photosynthesis and growth would be altered by increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Defoliation of developing leaflets on seedlings of a tropical tree, Copaifera aromatica, caused increases in photosynthesis under ambient CO2, but not under elevated CO2. An enhancement in the development of buds in the leaf axils followed defoliation at ambient levels of CO2. In contrast, under elevated CO2, enhanced development of buds occurred in undefoliated plants with no further enhancement in bud development due to exposure to elevated CO2.

This study determined the rates of main stem and tiller apical elongation and widening in plants grown under two levels of CO2 concentration. Spring wheat was grown at the University of Arizona's Maricopa Agricultural Center at elevated (550 mu mol mol(-1)) or ambient (370 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentrations. Individual plant samples were collected at different developmental stages and dissected. After dissection, the Lengths and widths of the spires of the main stem (MS), coleoptile tiller (T0), primary tillers (T1, T2, and T3), and secondary tillers (T00, T01, T02, T10, T11, and T12) were measured with a stage micrometer. Apex dimensions were fitted to an exponential model, Elevated CO2 increased the apex lengths of T2 at the double ridge stage, and of T3 and T10 at the double ridge and the terminal spikelet stages, and the apex widths of T2 at double ridge stage, and of T2, T3, T10, and T11 at the flag leaf appearance stage. Combining these results with a parallel study, the longer apices did not have more spikelet primordia, but wider apices had more floret primordia, Elevated CO2 changed apex elongation or widening patterns within a plant by enhancing elongation or widening rates of the MS, and later formed tillers. Earlier-formed tillers were less responsive to elevated CO2 levels.

The design and operation of the mesocosm and preliminary results for food production of the IAB are described for both periods. The overall rate of crop production for the 0.22 ha area (soil depth of 1 m; soil and atmospheric volumes of approximately 2000 m(3) and 38000 m(3), respectively) sustained both crews. Overall production rates in Biosphere 2 exceeded those characteristic of fertile agricultural land in the most efficient agrarian communities, despite comparatively lower light levels, lack of insect pollinators and unusually dense insect pests. Crop yields were markedly higher for Mission II than for Mission I due, in part, to experience and improvements based on the first closure. The health of the Biospherians is briefly discussed in the context of a low-calorie (1800-2200 kcal day(-1) per person for Mission I and 2200-2400 kcal day(- 1) for Mission II), nutrient-dense diet characteristic of the Biosphere 2 food paradigm. sigh productivity and biodiversity were due to many factors including high resolution climate control, hyper-intensive agricultural practices, selection and planting of food crops adapted to humid, tropical and sub- tropical conditions, nutrient recycling, intensive pest management, and the superambient levels of atmospheric CO2 (concentrations up to 4500 ppmv were reported during the 1991 to 1994 occupations). Radiation use efficiency (RUE) for wheat for both periods and a post-Mission II planting were comparable to RUEs observed in other experimental elevated CO2 settings such as Controlled Ecological Life Support-Systems (CELSS) and Free Air CO2 Enrichment studies (FACE) even though yields were comparatively lower due to low light levels. Integrated management of pests, soil conditions and agricultural practices were key factors in the sustainability of the IAB resulting in minimization of plant loss due to insect herbivory, nematode infestation and reduction in the quality of IAB soils. The use of soils rather than hydroponic systems for the IAB had significant consequences for CO2, N2O and O-2 concentrations in the Biosphere 2 atmosphere and rendered primary regeneration technologies ineffective over the periods of closure. The initial high organic carbon content of the IAB soils prescribed by the designers proved to be the largest single source of CO2 and the largest sink for O-2. The choice of a soil-based compared to a hydroponic-based agricultural system contributed to the accumulation of N2O to levels as high as 300 times current ambient levels (approximately 310 ppbv).

Environmental conditions were characterized by a day/night temperature regime of 27/17 degrees C, relative humidity (RH) levels around 45%, mean atmospheric CO2 concentration of 450 ppmv, and natural light conditions with mean intensities about half of outside levels. Weekly samples of above-ground plant matter were collected throughout the growing season and phenological events recorded. A computer model, CERES-Wheat, previously tested under both field and controlled conditions, was used to simulate the observed crop growth and to help in data analysis. We found that CERES-Wheat simulated the data collected at Biosphere 2 to within 10% of observed, thus suggesting that wheat growth inside the IAB was comparable to that documented in other environments. The model predicts phenological stages and final dry matter (DM) production within 10% of the observed data. Measured DM production rates, normalized for light absorbed by the crop, suggested photosynthetic efficiencies intermediate between those observed under optimal field conditions and those recorded in NASA-Controlled Ecological Life-Support Systems (CELSS).

The chemical composition (i.e. N, P, C, lignin and polyphenol concentrations) of Quercus pubescens leaf litter derived from a natural CO2 spring in Tuscany (Italy) was analysed and compared to litter from a nearby reference site. Litter was incubated for 25 months at both the natural CO2 spring and the reference site, and monitored for decomposition rates, nutrient and lignin concentrations. 2. Long-term exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations from the natural spring was associated with a change in the chemical composition of the Oak leaf litter, with decreases in P and polyphenol concentrations and increases in lignin. No differences in N concentrations were observed between the enriched CO2 litter from the natural spring and the reference litter. 3. Decomposition was reduced in the CO2 spring, with the lower P concentration of the native litter, combined with the lack of soil fauna observed at that site, being the factors most probably responsible for the measured decreases in mass loss. However, litter from the CO2 spring and reference litter decomposed at the reference site showed similar rates of decomposition. 4. All litter showed similar N concentrations during decomposition, with N being mineralized throughout the incubation period from both litter regardless of the site of incubation. In contrast, P dynamics differed between litter, with P being immobilized in the litter derived from the spring, and mineralized from the reference litter. When the litter from the spring was incubated at the reference site, there was a trend for net P uptake from the surrounding environment. The chemical composition of decomposing litter from the spring appeared to match that of the reference litter after 3 months of incubation at the reference site. 5.

Kenya, a high-altitude (2350 m a.s.l.) freshwater lake with a record extending from the last glacial (>40,000 cal. yr BP) through the present interglacial; Terrestrial and aquatic organic-matter sources were independently assessed using source-specific biomarkers. delta(13)C values of long-chain n- alkyl lipids from terrestrial higher plants exhibit large glacial to interglacial shifts: those from the last glacial maximum (LGM) (-20 to -18 parts per thousand) indicate a terrestrial vegetation dominated by C-4 grasses or sedges, whereas those from the early Holocene (-34 to -27 parts per thousand) reflect recolonization of the catchment area by C-3 plants, consistent with a rapid rise in the upper treeline. Specific algal biomarkers, including five unsaturated hydrocarbons of novel structure ascribed to the microalga Botryococcus braunii, were abundant, as confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). An extreme delta(13)C shift of over 25 parts per thousand is displayed by the algal biomarkers, an elevated value of -5.1 parts per thousand at the last glacial maximum (LGM) contrasting with a minimum value of -30.3 parts per thousand at the beginning of the Holocene. A major change in the molecular distributions of the algal biomarkers parallels this large delta(13)C shift, with acyclic isoprenoid hydrocarbons dominating the last glacial and cyclic isoprenoid hydrocarbons the Holocene.

We grew quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) under two levels of light and three levels of nutrient availability and measured photosynthesis, productivity, and foliar chemistry [water, total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC), condensed tannins, and phenolic glycosides]. Gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) and forest tent caterpillars (Malacosoma disstria) were reared on foliage from each of the treatments to determine effects on insect performance. Photosynthetic rates increased under high light, but were not influenced by nutrient availability. Tree growth increased in response to both the direct and interactive effects of light and nutrient availability. Increasing light reduced foliar nitrogen, while increasing nutrient availability increased foliar nitrogen. TNC levels were elevated under high light conditions, but were not influenced by nutrient availability. Starch and condensed tannins responded to changes in resource availability in a manner consistent with CNB theory; levels were highest under conditions where tree growth was limited more than photosynthesis (i.e., high light-low nutrient availability). Concentrations of phenolic glycosides, however, were only moderately influenced by resource availability. In general, insect performance varied relatively little among treatments. Both species performed most poorly on the high light-low nutrient availability treatment. Because phenolic glycosides are the primary factor determining aspen quality for these insects, and because levels of these compounds were minimally affected by the treatments, the limited response of the insects was not surprising. Thus, the ability of CNB theory to accurately predict allocation to defense compounds depends on the response of specific allelochemicals to changes in resource availability. Moreover, whether allelochemicals serve to defend the plant depends on the response of insects to specific allelochemicals. Finally, in contrast to predictions of CNB theory, we found substantial allocation to storage and defense compounds under conditions in which growth was carbon-limited (e.g., low light), suggesting a cost to defense in terms of reduced growth.2431^2^Stitt,M^Krapp,A^1999^1^The interaction between elevated carbon dioxide and nitrogen nutrition: the physiological and molecular background^9^22^6^583-621^^^^^Jun^^^^^76211026^1351^3518^3519^448^456^550^620^647^650^availability treatment.

The initial stimulation of photosynthesis in elevated [CO2] is often followed by a decline of photosynthesis, that is typically accompanied by a decrease of ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), an accumulation of carbohydrate especially starch, and a decrease of the nitrogen concentration in the plant. These changes are particularly marked when the nitrogen supply is low, whereas when the nitrogen supply is adequate there is no acclimation of photosynthesis, no major decrease in the internal concentration of nitrogen or the levels of nitrogen metabolites, and growth is stimulated markedly. Second, emerging evidence is discussed that signals derived from nitrate and nitrogen metabolites such as glutamine act to regulate the expression of genes involved in nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation? organic acid synthesis and starch accumulation, to modulate the sugar- mediated repression of the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and to modulate whole plant events including shoot-root allocation, root architecture and flowering. Third, increased rates of growth in elevated [CO2] will require higher rates of inorganic nitrogen uptake and assimilation. Recent evidence is discussed that an increased supply of sugars can increase the rates of nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, the synthesis of organic acid accepters, and the synthesis of amino acids. Fourth, interpretation of experiments in elevated [CO2] requires that the nitrogen status of the plants is monitored, The suitability of different criteria to assess the plant nitrogen status is critically discussed. Finally the review returns to experiments with elevated [CO2] and discusses the following topics: is, and if so how, are nitrate and ammonium uptake and metabolism stimulated in elevated [CO2], and does the result depend on the nitrogen supply? Is acclimation of photosynthesis the result of sugar- mediated repression of gene expression, end-product feedback of photosynthesis, nitrogen-induced senescence, or ontogenetic drift? Is the accumulation of starch a passive response to increased carbohydrate formation, or is it triggered by changes in the nutrient status? How do changes in sugar production and inorganic nitrogen assimilation interact in different conditions and at different stages of the life history to determine the response of whole plant growth and allocation to elevated [CO2]?2432^7^Heineke,D^Kauder,F^Frommer,W^Kuhn,C^Gillissen,B^Ludewig,F^Sonnewald,U^1999^1^Application of transgenic plants in understanding responses to atmospheric change^9^22^6^623-628^^^^^Jun^^^^^76231826^2125^3520^3521^372^441^448^564^685^845^turns to experiments with elevated [CO2] and discusses the following topics: is, and if so how, are nitrate and ammonium uptake and metabolism stimulated in elevated [CO2], and does the result dA^7622^Acclimation of plants to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a well described phenomenon, It is characterized by an increase in leaf carbohydrates and a degradation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase protein (Rubisco) leading in the long term to a lower rate of CO2 assimilation than expected from the kinetic constants of Rubisco, This article summarizes studies with transgenic plants grown in elevated pCO(2) which are modified in their capacity of CO2 fixation, of sucrose and starch synthesis, of triosephosphate and sucrose transport and of sink metabolism of sucrose, These studies show that a feedback accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves play only a minor role in acclimation, because leaf starch synthesis functions as an efficient buffer for photoassimilates.

This paper attempts to provide a framework within which some of this diversity can be explained. We describe the role of stomata in the short-term response of leaf gas exchange to increases in ambient CO2 concentration by developing the recently proposed stomatal model of Jarvis gr Davies (1998). In this model stomatal conductance is correlated with the functioning of the photosynthetic system so that the effects of increases in CO2 on stomata are experienced through changes in the rate of photosynthesis in a simple and mechanistically transparent way This model also allows us to consider the effects of evaporative demand and soil moisture availability on stomatal responses to photosynthesis and therefore provides a means of considering these additional sources of variation.

Recent reviews suggest that doubling the present C-a will reduce the respiration rate [per unit dry weight (DW)] by 15 to 18%. The effect has two components: an immediate, reversible effect observed in leaves, stems, and roots of plants as well as soil microbes, and an irreversible effect which occurs as a consequence of growth in elevated C-a and appears to be specific to C-3 species. The direct effect has been correlated with inhibition of certain respiratory enzymes, namely cytochrome-c-oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase, and the indirect or acclimation effect may be related to changes in tissue composition. Although no satisfactory mechanisms to explain these effects have been demonstrated, plausible mechanisms have been proposed and await experimental testing.

Because these two factors are concomitant, and the global [CO2] rise will affect all biomes across the full global range of temperatures, it is essential to review the theory and observations on effects of temperature and [CO2] interactions on plant carbon balance, growth, development, biomass accumulation and yield, Although there are sound theoretical reasons for expecting a larger stimulation of net CO2 assimilation rates by increased [CO2] at higher temperatures, this does not necessarily mean that the pattern of biomass and yield responses to increasing [CO2] and temperature is determined by this response. This paper reviews the interactions between the effects of [CO2] and temperature on plants. There is little unequivocal evidence for large differences in response to [CO2] at different temperatures, as studies are confounded by the different responses of species adapted and acclimated to different temperatures, and the interspecific differences in growth form and development pattern.

Experiments using open-top chambers have been established at many sites to test whether the short- term responses of tree seedlings described in controlled environments would be sustained over several growing seasons under field conditions. Here we review the results of those experiments, using the framework of the interacting cycles of carbon, water and nutrients, because that is the framework of the ecosystem models that are being used to address the decades-long response of forests. Our analysis suggests that most of what was learned in seedling studies was qualitatively correct, The evidence from field-grown trees suggests a continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis of about 60% for a 300 p.p.m, increase in [CO2], and there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Despite the importance of respiration to a tree's carbon budget, no strong scientific consensus has yet emerged concerning the potential direct or acclimation response of woody plant respiration to CO2 enrichment. The relative effect of CO2 on above-ground dry mass was highly variable and greater than that indicated by most syntheses of seedling studies. Effects of CO2 concentration on static measures of response are confounded with the acceleration of ontogeny observed in elevated CO2. The trees in these open-top chamber experiments were in an exponential growth phase, and the large growth responses to elevated CO2 resulted from the compound interest associated with an increasing leaf area. This effect cannot be expected to persist in a closed-canopy forest where growth potential is constrained by a steady-state leaf area index, A more robust and informative measure of tree growth in these experiments is the annual increment in wood mass per unit leaf area, which increased 27% in elevated CO2. There is no support for the conclusion from many studies of seedlings that root-to- shoot ratio is increased by elevated CO2; the production of fine roots may be enhanced, but it is not clear that this response would persist in a forest. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were lower in CO2-enriched trees, but to a lesser extent than was indicated in seedling studies and only when expressed on a leaf mass basis, The prediction that leaf litter C/N ratio would increase was not supported in field experiments. Also contrasting with seedling studies, there is little evidence from the field studies that stomatal conductance is consistently affected by CO2; however, this is a topic that demands more study. Experiments with trees in open- top chambers under field conditions have provided data on longer-term, larger-scale responses of trees to elevated CO2 under field conditions, confirmed some of the conclusions from previous seedling studies, and challenged other conclusions. There remain important obstacles to using these experimental results to predict forest responses to rising CO2, but the studies are valuable nonetheless for guiding ecosystem model development and revealing the critical questions that must be addressed in new larger-scale CO2 experiments.2437^1^Ellsworth,D S^1999^1^CO2 enrichment in a maturing pine forest: are CO2 exchange and water status in the canopy affected?^9^22^5^461-472^^^^^May^^^^^76331099^2489^256^361^374^398^444^483^514^92^io would increase was not supported in field experiments.

Leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange responses and plant and soil water relations were examined in a maturing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L,) stand in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in North Carolina, USA to test if these parameters were affected by elevated CO2, Current-year foliage in the canopy was continuously exposed to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 + 200 mu mol mol(-1)) in free-air during needle growth and development for lip to 400 d. Photosynthesis in upper canopy foliage was stimulated by 50-60% by elevated CO2 compared with ambient controls. This enhancement was similar in current-year, ambient-grown foliage temporarily measured at elevated CO2 compared with long-term elevated CO2 grown foliage, Significant photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 was maintained over a range of conditions except during peak drought. There was no evidence of water savings in elevated CO2 plots in FACE compared to ambient plots under drought and non-drought conditions. This was supported by evidence from three independent measures. First, stomatal conductance was not significantly different in elevated CO2 versus ambient trees of P. taeda, Calculations of time-integrated c(i)/c(a) ratios from analysis of foliar delta(13)C showed that these ratios were maintained in foliage under elevated CO2. Second, soil moisture was not significantly different between ambient and elevated CO2 plots during drought. Third, pre-dawn and mid-day leaf water potentials were also unaffected by the seasonal CO2 exposure, as were tissue osmotic potentials and turgor loss points. Together the results strongly support the hypothesis that maturing P. taeda trees have low stomatal responsiveness to elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 effects on water relations in loblolly pine-dominated forest ecosystems may be absent or small apart from those mediated by leaf area. Large photosynthetic enhancements in the upper canopy of P. taeda by elevated CO2 indicate that this maturing forest may have a large carbon sequestration capacity with limiting water supply.2438^3^Myers,D A^Thomas,R B^Delucia,E H^1999^1^Photosynthetic capacity of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees during the first year of carbon dioxide enrichment in a forest ecosystem^9^22^5^473-481^^^^^May^^^^^7635130^256^344^348^360^372^384^385^444^665^iage under elevated CO2.

Large A^7634^Our objective was to assess the photosynthetic responses of loblolly pine trees (Pinus taeda L,) during the first full growth season (1997) at the Brookhaven National Lab/Duke University Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Gas exchange, fluorescence characteristics, and leaf biochemistry of ambient CO2 (control) needles and ambient + 20 Pa CO2 (elevated) needles were examined five times during the year. The enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in mature loblolly pine trees varied across the season and was influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. Photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 was strongly correlated with leaf temperature. The magnitude of photosynthetic enhancement was zero in March but was as great as 52% later in the season. In March, reduced sink demand and lower temperatures resulted in lower net photosynthesis, lower carboxylation rates and higher excess energy dissipation from the elevated CO2 needles than from control needles, The greatest photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 enrichment was observed in July during a period of high temperature and low precipitation, and in September during recovery from this period of low precipitation, In July, loblolly pine trees in the control rings exhibited lower net photosynthetic rates, lower maximum rates of photosynthesis at saturating CO2 and light, lower values of carboxylation and electron transport rates (modelled from A-C-i curves), lower total Rubisco activity, and lower photochemical quenching of fluorescence in comparison to other measurement periods. During this period of low precipitation trees in the elevated CO2 rings exhibited reduced net photosynthesis and photochemical quenching of fluorescence, but there was little effect on light- and CO2-saturated rates of photosynthesis, modelled rates of carboxylation or electron transport, or Rubisco activity.

Their putative interaction in stomatal regulation was investigated in well-watered air-grown or double CO2-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants, using gas exchange and epidermal strip experiments. With plants grown in normal air, a doubling of the CO2 concentration resulted in a rapid and transient drop in leaf conductance followed by recovery to the pre-treatment level after about two photoperiods. Despite the fact that plants placed in air or in double CO2 for 2 d exhibited similar levels of leaf conductance, their stomatal responses to an osmotic stress (0.16-0.24 MPa) were different. The decrease in leaf conductance in response to the osmotic stress was strongly enhanced at elevated CO2, Similarly, the drop in leaf conductance triggered by 1 mu M ABA applied at the root level was stronger at double CO2. Identical experiments were performed with plants fully grown at double CO2, Levels of leaf conductance and carbon assimilation rate measured at double CO2 were similar for air-grown and elevated CO2-grown plants. An enhanced response to ABA was still observed at high CO2 in pre- conditioned plants. It is concluded that: (i) in the absence of stress, elevated CO2 slightly affects leaf conductance in A. thaliana; (ii) there is a strong interaction in stomatal responses to CO2 and ABA which is not modified by growth at elevated CO2.2440^3^Huxman,K A^Smith,S D^Neuman,D S^1999^1^Root hydraulic conductivity of Larrea tridentata and Helianthus annuus under elevated CO2^9^22^3^325-330^^^^^Mar^^^^^7639245^374^376^409^417^430^465^610^881^92^ to an osmotic stress (0.16-0.24 MPa) were different.

Knowledge of functional root responses may be particularly important in ecosystems where water is limiting if predictions about global climate change are true. In this study we investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on the root hydraulic conductivity (L-p) of a C-3 perennial, Lawea tridentata, and a C-3 annual, Helianthus annuus. The plants were grown in a glasshouse under ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2. The L-p through intact root systems was measured using a hydrostatic pressure-induced flow system. Leaf gas exchange was also determined for both species and leaf water potential (psi(leaf)) was determined in L, tridentata, The L-p of L, tridentata roots was unchanged by an elevated CO2 growth environment. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration (E) decreased and photosynthetic rate (A(net)) and psi(leaf) increased in L, tridentata, There were no changes in biomass, leaf area, stem diameter or root : shoot (R : S) ratio for L, tridentata. In H, annuus, elevated CO2 induced a nearly two- fold decrease in root L-p. There was no effect of growth under elevated CO2 on A(net), g(s), E, above- and below-ground dry mass, R : S ratio, leaf area, root length or stem diameter in this species. The results demonstrate that rising atmospheric CO2 can impact water uptake and transport in roots in a species-specific manner. Possible mechanisms for the observed decrease in root L-p in H, annuus under elevated CO2 are currently under investigation and may relate to either axial or radial components of root L-p.2441^3^Lin,W H^Bai,K Z^Kuang,T Y^1999^1^Effects of elevated CO2 and high temperature on single leaf and canopy photosynthesis of rice^384^41^6^624-628^^^^^Jun^^^^^7641312^376^674^evated CO2 growth environment.

In such condition, photosynthetic response of leaf is relatively well studied, while the comparison of that between single leaf and whole canopy is less emphasized. The stimulation of elevated CO2 on canopy photosynthesis may be different from that on single leaf level.. In this study, leaf and canopy photosynthesis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were studied throughout the growing season. High CO2 and temperature had. a synergetic stimulation on single leaf photosynthetic rate until grain filling. Photosynthesis of leaf was stimulated by high CO2, although the stimulation was decreased by higher temperature at grain filling stage. On the other hand, the simulation of elevated CO2 on canopy photosynthesis leveled off with time. Stimulation at canopy level disappeared by grain filling stage in both temperature treatments. Green leaf area index was not significantly affected by CO2 at maturity, but greater in plants grown at higher temperature. Leaf nitrogen content decreased with the increase of CO2 concentration although it was not statistically significant at maturity. Canopy respiration rate increased at flowering stage indicating higher carbon loss: Shading effect caused bu leaf development reached maximum at flowering stage. The CO2 stimulation on photosynthesis was greater in single leaf than in canopy, Since enhanced CO2 significantly increased biomass of rice stems and panicles, increase in canopy respiration caused diminishment of CO2 stimulation in canopy net photosynthesis. Leaf nitrogen in the canopy level decreased with CO2 concentration and may eventually hasten CO2 stimulation on canopy photosynthesis. Early senescence of canopy leaves in high CO2 is also a possible cause.2442^3^Hedges,L V^Gurevitch,J^Curtis,P S^1999^1^The meta-analysis of response ratios in experimental ecology^11^80^4^1150-1156^^^^^Jun^^^^^7643174^3528^ index was not significantly affected by CO2 at maturity, but greater in plants grown at higher temperature.

LA^7644^The 3-dimensional forest model MAESTRO was used to simulate daily and annual photosynthesis and transpiration fluxes of forest stands and the sensitivity of these flutes to potential changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]), temperature, water stress and phenology. The effects of possible feed-backs from increased leaf area and limitations to leaf nutrition were simulated by imposing changes in leaf area and nitrogen content. Two different tree species were considered: Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr., a conifer with long needle longevity and large leaf area, and Betula pendula Roth., a broad-leaved deciduous species with an open canopy and small leaf area. Canopy photosynthetic production in trees was predicted to increase with atmospheric [CO2] and length of the growing season and to decrease with increased water stress. Associated increases in leaf area increased production further only in the B. pendula canopy, where the original leaf area was relatively small. Assumed limitations in N uptake affected B. pendula more than P. sitchensis. The effect of increased temperature was shown to depend on leaf area and nitrogen content. The different sensitivities of the two species were related to their very different canopy structure. increased [CO2] reduced transpiration, but larger leaf area, early leaf growth, and higher temperature all led to increased water use. These effects were limited by feedbacks from soil water stress. The simulations suggest that, with the projected climate change, there is some increase in stand annual 'water use efficiency', but that actual water losses to the atmosphere may not always decrease.2444^2^Leung,L R^Ghan,S J^1999^1^Pacific northwest climate sensitivity simulated by a regional climate model driven by a GCM.

Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper. the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small- scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation modal and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large- scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (1.5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall. snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.2445^2^Baxter,R^Farrar,J F^1999^1^Export of carbon from leaf blades of Poa alpina L-at elevated CO2 and two nutrient regimes^78^50^336^1215-1221^^^^^Jul^^^^^7649130^189^244^3364^344^362^678^711^92^ease in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast.

This may influence the activity, the biomass, and the structure of soil and rhizosphere microbial communities and therefore the nutrient cycling rates and the plant growth. The present paper focuses on bacterial numbers and on community structure. The rhizospheres of two grassland plants, Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and Trifolium repens (white clover), were divided into three fractions: the bulk soil, the rhizospheric soil, and the rhizoplaneendorhizosphere. The elevated atmospheric CO2 content increased the most probable numbers of heterotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere of L. perenne.

Thus, the effects of ambient or elevated CO2 (approximately 200 mu mol.mol(-1) above ambient) and ambient or elevated temperature (approximately 4 degrees C above ambient) were evaluated for both main and second (lammas) flushes of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France). Established seedlings were grown for three full growing seasons in outdoor, sunlit chambers, which maintained diel and seasonal variation in climate. A reconstructed forest soil was used with a seasonal wet and dry cycle and without added fertilizer. Compared with ambient CO2 elevated CO2 had no impact on overall phenology and growth of terminal shoots, needles, or buds. In contrast, compared with ambient temperature, elevated temperature resulted in higher shoot and needle growth rates early in the season; reduced final terminal shoot length; and either reduced, increased, or unchanged final needle length, depending on season. Initiation of the lammas flush was delayed and (or) decreased at elevated temperature. Leading terminal bud break and growth occurred earlier; however, resting bud length was reduced, and bud width tended to increase with elevated temperature. Thus, at least during early seedling growth, elevated temperatures may reduce both main- and lammas- flush growth, thereby altering tree productivity, whereas elevated CO2 may have little effect on main or lammas growth at either the current or elevated temperature.2448^3^Jager,H J^Hertstein,U^Fangmeier,A^1999^1^The European Stress Physiology and Climate Experiment - project 1. wheat (ESPACE-wheat): introduction, aims and methodology^314^10^3-4^155-162^^^^^Apr^^^^^76551285^130^1828^312^344^372^374^434^447^92^n contrast, compared with ambient temperature, elevated temperature resulted in higher shoot and needle growth rates early in the season; reduced final termA^7654^The response of crops to CO2 enrichment represents an issue of major concern both for scientists and for policymakers.

Minaret, grown in open-top chambers at different sites throughout Europe for up to 3 years at each site, were investigated in response to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 x2) and ozone (ambient ozone x1.5) concentrations. Phenological development varied among experiments and was partly explained by differences in temperature among sites and years. There was a weak positive relationship between the thermal rate of development and the mean daylength for the period from emergence to anthesis. Main stems produced on average 7.7 leaves with little variation among experiments. Variation was higher for the thermal rate of leaf emergence, which was partly explained by differences in the rate of change of daylength at plant emergence among seasons. Phenological development, rate of leaf emergence and final leaf number were not affected by CO2 and ozone exposure. Responses of tillering and LAI to CO2 and ozone exposure were significant only in some experiments. However, the direction of responses was consistent for most experiments. The number of tillers and ears per plant, respectively, was increased as a result of CO2 enrichment by about 13% at the beginning of stem elongation (DC31), at anthesis and at maturity. Exposure to ozone had no effect on tillering. LAI was increased as a result of CO2 elevation by about 11% at DC31 and by about 14% at anthesis. Ozone exposure reduced LAI at anthesis by about 9%. No such effect was observed at DC31. There were very few interactive effects of CO2 and ozone on tillering and LAI. Variations in tillering and LAI, and their responses to CO2 and ozone exposure, were partly explained by single linear relationships considering differences in plant density, tiller density and the duration of developmental phases among experiments. Consideration of temperature and incident photosynthetically active radiation in this analysis did not reduce the unexplained variation. There was a negative effect of ozone exposure on leaf area duration at most sites. Direct effects of elevated CO2 concentration on leaf senescence, both positive and negative, were observed in some experiments. There was evidence in several experiments that elevated CO2 concentration ameliorated the negative effect of ozone on leaf area duration. It was concluded from these results that an analysis of the interactive effects of climate, CO2 and ozone on canopy development requires reference to the physiological processes involved.

The effect of different treatments (CO2 enrichment, O-3 fumigation, drought stress and temperature) on the chlorophyll content of the flag leaf was investigated using the MINOLTA SPAD-502 meter. Under optimum growth conditions the maximum chlorophyll content, which was reached at anthesis, was consistent among the sites ranging from 460 to 500 mg chlorophyll m(-2). No significant effect of elevated CO2 or O-3 was observed at anthesis. Leaf senescence, indicated by the chlorophyll breakdown after anthesis, was relatively constant in the control chambers. Under control conditions, thermal time until 50% chlorophyll loss was reached was 600 degrees C day. Elevated CO2 caused a faster decline in chlorophyll content (thermal time until 50% chlorophyll loss was reduced to 500-580 degrees C day) indicating a faster rate of plant development at two experimental sites. The effect of ozone on chlorophyll content depended on the time and dose of O-3 exposure. During grain filling, high O-3 concentrations induced premature senescence of the flag leaves (up to -130 degrees C day). This deleterious effect was mitigated by elevated CO2.

Minaret crop stands were grown under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations at seven sites in Germany, Ireland, the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands. Six of the sites used open-top chambers and one used a controlled environment mimicking field conditions. The effect of elevated CO2 for a range of N application regimes, O-3 concentrations, and growth temperatures on flag leaf photosynthesis was studied. Before anthesis, flag leaf photosynthesis was stimulated about 50% by 650 compared with 350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 at all sites, regardless of other treatments. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a decrease in photosynthetic capacity of flag leaves due to growth at elevated CO2 before anthesis, even for low N treatments. However, photosynthetic capacity, particularly carboxylation capacity, of flag leaves was usually decreased by growth at elevated CO2 after anthesis, especially in low N treatments. Acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated CO2 therefore appears to occur only slowly, consistent with a response to changes in sink-source relationships, rather than a direct response. Effect of elevated CO2 on stomatal conductance was much more variable between sites and treatments, but on average was decreased by similar to 10% at 650 compared with 350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Carboxylation capacity of flag leaves was decreased by growth at elevated O-3 both before and after anthesis, regardless of CO2 concentration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Carbon dioxide enrichment proved to affect nutrient concentrations in a complex manner, In green leaves, all elements (with exception of phosphorus and iron) decreased. In contrast, effects on the element composition of grains were restricted to reductions in nitrogen, calcium, sulphur and iron. Ozone exposure resulted in no significant effects on nutrient element concentrations in different tissues in the overall analysis. The nitrogen demand of green tissues was reduced due to CO2 enrichment as shown by reductions in the critical leaf nitrogen concentration and also enhanced nitrogen use efficiency. Reductions in the content of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and repression of the photorespiratory pathway and reduced nitrogen allocation to enzymes driving the photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle were chiefly responsible for this effect. Thus, nitrogen acquisition by the crop did not match carbon acquisition under CO2 enrichment, Since crop nitrogen uptake from the soil was already completed at anthesis, nitrogen allocated to the grain after anthesis originated from vegetative poors-causing grain nitrogen concentrations to decrease under CO2 enrichment (on average by 15% when CO2 concentrations increased from 360 to 680 mu mol mol(-1)). Correspondingly, grain quality was reduced by CO2 enrichment. The Zeleny value, Hagberg value and dry/wet gluten content decreased significantly with increasing [CO2].

In most experiments, spring wheat cv. Minaret was subjected to two levels of atmospheric CO2 and two levels of ozone. Grain yields in the control treatments (ambient levels of CO2 and O-3) varied strongly between sites. Also, yield response to elevated CO2 and O-3 showed great variation. The present study was conducted to determine whether climatic differences between sites could account for the observed variation. Two simulation models were used for the analysis: AFRCWHEAT2-O3 and LINTULCC. AFRCWHEAT2- O3 simulates phenology, canopy development and photosynthesis in greater detail than LINTULCC. Both models account for the effects of radiation and temperature on crop growth. New algorithms were developed to simulate the effects of CO2 and O- 3. Weather data that were measured in the experiments were used as input, and simulated growth responses to CO2 and O-3 were compared with measurements. No attempt was made to merge the two models. Thus two independent tools for analysis of data related to climate change were developed and applied. The average measured grain yield in the control treatment, across all 25 experiments, was 5.9 tons per hectare (t ha(-1)), with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.9 t ha(-1). The models predicted similar average yields (5.5 and 5.8 t ha(-1) for AFRCWHEAT2-O3 and LINTULCC, respectively), but smaller variation (SD for both models: 1.2 t ha(-1)). Average measured yield increase due to CO2-doubling was 30% (SD 22%). AFRCWHEAT2-O3 expected a slightly lower value (24%, SD 9%), whereas LINTULCC overestimated the response (42%, SD 11%). The average measured yield decrease due to nearly-doubled O-3 levels was 9% (SD 11%). Both models showed similar results, albeit at lower variation (7% yield decrease at SDs of 6 and 4%). Simulations accounted well for the observation that, at elevated CO2, the percentage yield loss due to O-3 was lower than at ambient CO2. The models predicted lower variation among sites and years than was measured. Yield response to CO2 and O-3 was predicted to depend on the climate, with a predominant effect of temperature on the response to CO2. In the measurements, these climatic effects were indeed observed, but a greater part of the variation was not related to light intensity, temperature, CO2, or O-3. This unexplained variability in the measured dataset was probably caused by factors not accounted for in the models, possibly related to soil characteristics.

The C-12/C-14 ratios were measured by accelerated mass spectroscopy on soil sampled from a deciduous temperate forest in Switzerland during 1969-1995. The resulting Delta(14)C values (125-174 parts per thousand) were in line with previously published C-14 soil data. We applied FORCLIM-D, a model of nonliving organic matter decomposition including nine litter and two soil compartments to estimate SOC turnover times for this forest type. Carbon 14 aging in woody vegetation was explicitly accounted for. Parameters were calibrated to match radiocarbon ratios observed for forest soils at Meathop Wood, United Kingdom [Harkness et al., 1986]. We estimated that roughly 50-94% (best estimate, 49%) of foliar litter carbon and 11-74% (73%) of fine root litter carbon are eventually respired as CO2 at Meathop Wood; the rest is transferred to soil humus, where it undergoes further decomposition. Turnover times for the 0-20 cm mineral soil layer ranged from 9-50 years (25 years) for a fast overturning soil compartment comprising 38-74% (68%) of bulk SOC and 155-10,018 years (3,570 years) for a slowly overturning compartment. For the Swiss site, SOC turnover times were in the same range. Parameter uncertainties were correlated and induced by uncertainties in C-14 observations from small-scale spatial inhomogeneities, sample preparation and by lack of reliable C- 14 observations for the "prebomb" test period. Model-based estimates of soil organic C turnover derived from C-14 data must be used cautiously since they depend on the underlying model structure: bypassing litter in FORCLIM-D overestimated SOC turnover by a factor of 2.5.

We studied effects of N availability and atmospheric CO2 concentration, two components of global biogeochemistry that are changing, on relationships between whole-plant transpiration and N in two perennial C-3 species, Pseudoroegneria spicata (a tussock grass) and Gutierrezia microcephala ia half-shrub). Two indices of plant N requirement were used: N accretion (N in live and dead tissues) and N loss in litter (N in dead tissues). Transpiration was analyzed as the product of N accretion or loss by plants and the ratio of transpiration to N accretion or loss. The two indices of plant N requirement led to different conclusions as to the effects of N availability on plant use of water relative to N. Transpiration scaled proportionally with N accretion, but transpiration per unit of N loss declined at high N. Carbon dioxide enrichment had little effect on the ratio of transpiration to N accretion and no effect on transpiration per unit of N lass. The two species accumulated similar amounts of N, but the half-shrub used more than twice as much water as the grass. Nitrogen availability and CO2 concentration influenced whole-plant transpiration more by changing plant N accumulation than by altering the stoichiometry between transpiration and plant N. Species differences in total water use, by contrast, reflected differences in the scaling of transpiration to plant N. A better under standing of species differences in water and N dynamics may thus be required to predict transpiration reliably.2457^3^Mishra,R S^Abdin,M Z^Uprety,D C^1999^1^Interactive effects of elevated CO2 and moisture stress on the photosynthesis, water relation and growth of Brassica species^161^182^4^223-229^^^^^Jun^^^^^76732841^344^361^400^409^434^scaled proportionally with N accretion, but transpiration per unit of N loss deA^7672^Interactive effects of elevated CO2 and moisture stress on photosynthesis, growth and water relation of Brassica species were studied using open top chamber technology.

We use the hierarchical framework presented in Fig. 1 as a basis for organizing many unanswered questions, and several questions that have not been asked, concerning the role of AM in responses to elevated atmospheric CO2. We include the following levels: plant host, plant population, plant community, functional group and ecosystem. Measurements of the contributions of AM fungi at the various levels require the use of different response variables. For example, hyphal nutrient translocation rates or percent AM root infection may be important measures at the individual plant level, but hyphal biomass or glomalin production and turnover are more relevant at the ecosystem level. There is a discrepancy between our knowledge of the multifaceted role of AM fungi in plant and ecosystem ecology and most of the current research aimed at elucidating the importance of this symbiosis in global-change scenarios.

In contrast to predictions based on the carbon composition of end products, the PCM is based on metabolic origins of pathway constituents, alternative fates of pathway precursors, and biochemical regulatory mechanisms. Protein and phenolic synthesis compete for the common, limiting resource phenylalanine, so protein and phenolic allocation are inversely correlated. Phenolic allocation can be predicted from the effects of development, inherent growth rate and environment on leaf functions that create competing demands for proteins or phenolics. We present the model general principles. We predict phenolic concentrations as leaves develop; in inherently fast versus slow growing species; and in response to the environment (nitrogen, light, phosphorus, heat shock, herbivore and pathogen injury, and carbon dioxide). Because predictions generally fit observed patterns, we argue that, for phenylalanine-derived phenolics, the mechanistically distinctive PCM complements the Growth Differentiation and Resource Availability Hypotheses, and is a viable, testable alternative to the Carbon Nutrient Balance Hypothesis.2461^1^Roberntz,P^1999^1^Effects of long-term CO2 enrichment and nutrient availability in Norway spruce.

Karst.] trees were enclosed in ventilated, transparent plastic bags and flushed with air containing ambient (A approximate to 370 mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) or ambient plus 340 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) (EL). Light-saturated photosynthesis was on average 56% higher in EL compared to A. Branch phenology and morphology were strongly related to nitrogen concentration (mg g(-1) dry mass) in the foliage and to elevated temperatures in the bags, but no direct effect of EL was found. In 1995, budbreak occurred on average 4 days earlier in the bags compared to the control branches, which was partly explained by the temperature elevation in the bags. No nutrient or EL effect on budbreak was found. Increases in temperature and nitrogen supply increased shoot growth: together they explained 76% of the variation in the extension rate, 63% of the variation in extension duration and 65% of the variation in final length of leading shoots. Shoot morphology was altered both by increased nitrogen availability and by the enclosure induced environmental changes inside the bags, leading to reduced mutual shading between needles. Specific needle area (SNA) was lower in EL, but this was related to lower nitrogen concentrations. Total dry mass of the branches was unaffected by EL. It is concluded that treating individual branches of Norway spruce with elevated CO2 does not increase branch growth. The nutrient status of the branch and climate determine its growth, i.e, its sink strength for carbon. Increased export of carbohydrates to the rest of the tree is probable in EL treated branches.2462^2^Cairney,J W G^Meharg,A A^1999^1^Influences of anthropogenic pollution on mycorrhizal fungal communities^35^106^2^169-182^^^^^^^^^^76831064^1342^1848^2530^3547^3548^479^602^605^733^rowth: together they explained 76% of the variation in the extension rate, 63% of the variation in extension duration and 65% of the variation in final length of leading shoots.

To achieve similar growth, non-mycorrhizal plants received phosphorus in solution whereas mycorrhizal plants were supplied with bonemeal. Measures of plant growth, photosynthesis and carbon input to the soil were obtained, Elevated CO2 stimulated plant growth to the same extent in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, but had no effect on the partitioning of carbon between shoots and roots or on shoot tissue phosphorus concentration. Mycorrhizal colonization was low, but unaffected by CO2 treatment. Net photosynthesis was stimulated both by mycorrhizal colonization and elevated CO2, and there was a more than additive effect of the two treatments on net photosynthesis. Colonization by mycorrhizal fungi inhibited acclimation, in terms of net carbon assimilation, of plants to elevated CO2. C-13 natural abundance techniques were used to measure carbon input into the soil, although the results were not conclusive. Direct measurements of below-ground root biomass showed that elevated CO2 did stimulate carbon flow below-ground and this was higher in mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal plants.

The grasslands showed contrasting root responses to CO2, enrichment: whereas root length was not affected in the sandstone grassland, it was greater in the serpentine grassland, as was specific root length. AM fungal hyphal lengths were greater in the sandstone, but were unaffected in the serpentine community. This lent support to the hypothesis that there may be a tradeoff in resource allocation to more fine roots or greater mycorrhizal extraradical hyphal length. AM root infection was greater in both communities at elevated CO2, as was the proportion of roots containing arbuscules.

This study iA^7706^Temporal and spatial respiration rates were determined in a 5.7-m thick, sandy, unsaturated zone over a 550-day period using measured CO2 concentrations, CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere, moisture contents, and temperatures. Cyclical patterns in CO2 concentrations were measured in duplicate nests of nine gas samplers. Maximum CO2 gas concentrations occurred during the summer (0.85-1.22%), and minimum concentrations occurred during the winter (0.04-0.24%). CO2 gas concentrations decreased with increasing depth during the summer and increased with depth during the winter. A one-dimensional finite element model was developed to quantify transient respiration rates through the unsaturated zone. The model was calibrated to the measured CO2 concentrations. Temperature and moisture content variations were represented with an analytical expression and linear interpolation of field-measured values, respectively, in the model. Simulation results provided very good approximations to the field-measured CO2 concentrations, but predicted CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere were higher than measured. Respiration rates ranged from 5 mu g C g(-1) d(-1) in the soil horizon during the summer to about <10(-4) mu g C g(-1) d(-1) in unsaturated sections of the C horizon.

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using images produced by a digital camera to measure the senescence rate of wheat and to compare the results with changes in greenness determined by two established methods. Measurements were made as part of an experiment to determine the effects of elevated CO2 and limited soil nitrogen on spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at the University of Arizona's Maricopa Agricultural Center, near Phoenix, AZ. "Greenness" measurements were made during senescence of the crop with a color digital camera, a hand-held radiometer, and a SPAD chlorophyll meter. The green to red (GIR) for each pixel in an image was calculated and the average GIR computed for cropped images from a digital camera representing 1 m(2) for each treatment and sample date. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated from the red and near-infrared canopy reflectances measured with a hand held radiometer. A SPAD reading was obtained from randomly selected flag leaves. All three methods of measuring plant greenness showed similar temporal trends. The relationships between GIR with NDVI and SPAD were linear over most of the range of GIR. However, NDVI was more sensitive at low values than GIR. GIR was more sensitive above G/R values of 1.2 than SPAD because the upper limits of SPAD measurements were constrained by the amount of chlorophyll in the leaf, while GIR responded to both chlorophyll concentration in the leaves as well as the number of leaves present.

The normalized difference A^7712^Ozone (O-3) in the troposphere can cause plant stress leading to foliar injury and suppressed growth and yield, whereas elevated CO2 generally enhances growth and yield. Numerous studies have been performed to determine effects of O-3 and CO2 separately, but relatively few have been performed to determine if O-3 can affect plant response to CO2 or vice versa. Open-top field chambers were used to determine if such interactions occur for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), which is relatively sensitive to O-3. Nitrogen nutrition is especially important in cotton production so N nutrition was included as an experimental factor. Plants were grown in 14-L pots at low, medium, and high soil N levels and exposed to three CO2 and two or three O-3 treatments in all combinations during two seasons. The CO2 treatments were ambient (370 mu L L-1) and two treatments with CO2 added for 24 h d(-1) at approximately 1.5 and 2.0 Limes ambient. In 1995, the O-3 treatments were charcoal filtered air (CP), and nonfiltered air (NF) with O-3 added for 12 h d(-1) (NF+). In 1996, a NF treatment was also included to represent ambient O-3 conditions. The CF, NF, and NF+ treatments resulted in seasonal O-3 concentrations of approximately 23, 51, and 75 nL L-1. Carbon dioxide enrichment generally stimulated growth and yield whereas O-3 exposure suppressed growth. and yield. Stimulation induced by CO2 increased as O-3 stress increased. For example, in 1995 at medium N, the percentage increase in yield caused by doubling CO2 in CF air was 0%, but was 52% in NF+ air. Comparable values for 1996 were 23% in CF air and 140% in NF+ air. These interactions occurred for a range of soil N levels, and were probably caused by CO2-induced prevention of O-3 stress.

The low O-2 and high CO2 atmospheres prevented the rise in ethylene production, total carotenoid and lycopene biosynthesis and alpha- and beta- galactosidase activity and slowed down chlorophyll degradation and loss of firmness (P<0.05). These suppressive effects were not reversed, or only in part - in the case of chlorophyll breakdown - by addition of 100 mu g g(-1) C2H4 to said controlled atmospheres. After transfer from the various atmospheres to air, flesh firmness decreased and ethylene production, total carotenoids, lycopene and beta-galactosidase II activity increased but these parameters were, in all cases, still significantly different from those of fruit held in air. Keeping tomatoes in controlled atmospheres, even in the presence of ethylene, had marked residual effects.

The growth of the plantlets was greatly enhanced after growing for 3 months at 1% CO2 compared with the control plantlets (0.035% CO2). CO2 enrichment produced more than a 2- fold increase in dry matter production. The enhanced root growth at 1% CO2 led to a higher root:shoot ratio. Plantlets grown at super-elevated CO2 had higher F-v/F-m values, a higher photochemical quenching (q(P)) and a relatively lower non- photochemical quenching (q(N)). CO2 at 1% appeared to enhance the utilization of captured light energy in the orchid plantlets. CO2 enrichment also increased contents of soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose) and starch in the orchid plantlets. The extra starch formed under 1% CO, did not cause a disruption of the chloroplasts. Chlorophyll content was higher and a clear granal stacking was evident in young leaves and roots of plantlets grown at 1% CO2. An extensive thylakoid system was observed in the young leaf chloroplasts of the CO2- enriched plantlets indicating an improved development of the photosynthetic apparatus when compared to that of the control plantlets. The increased photosynthetic capacity and enhanced growth of the epiphytic roots under CO, enrichment would facilitate the generation of more photoassimilates and acquisition of essential resources, thereby increasing the survival rate of orchid plantlets under stressful field conditions.

Half of the communities contained six graminoids and eight nan-legume forb species, In the other half, four non-legume forbs were replaced by legumes. 2, Ecosystem responses. Above-ground phytomass (>5 cm) hardly responded to elevated CO2 alone. However, when P and legumes were combined. the CO2 effect on above-ground community phytomass in year two was a stimulation of 45% (P < 0.001).

We tested this hypothesis using leaf litter of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and branchlets (wood + bark) of spruce (Picea abies) produced under contrasting CO2 concentrations in model ecosystems. Both types of litter produced under elevated CO2 had significantly lower N concentrations, but showed no CO2-related differences in carbon and lignin concentrations. Decomposition rates (mass loss) assessed in a natural temperate forest were significantly slower in litter produced at high CO2. However, this effect became stronger in beech leaves but gradually disappeared in spruce branchlets over the 331-d exposure period. Irrespective of CO2 treatment beech leaf litter lost 16% of its initial N content. Spruce branchlets produced at low CO2 lost 50% of their initial N content, and those produced at high CO2 lost 26%. Two isopod species representing native macro-decomposers consumed 36% more of the high CO2-produced beech litter than they did of low CO2-produced beech litter. Only small, and non- significant increases in consumption of high CO2-produced spruce branchlets were observed. Isopods feeding on high CO, litter also produced more feces than those feeding litter from low CO2. Our results indicate that CO2-induced litter quality changes influence only certain stages of decomposition. and that these stages differ between different litter types. Inhibitory effects of elevated CO2, however, may be compensated by the positive feed-back of intensified "litter processing" of low quality litter by macro-decomposers.

Therefore, we investigated plant growth, mineral nutrition, starch, and net gas exchange responses of two Citrus spp. to phosphorus (P) nutrition and mycorrhizas at elevated atmospheric [CO2]. Half of the seedlings of sour orange (C. aurantium L.) and `Ridge Pineapple' sweet orange (C. sinensis L. Osbeck) were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith and half were non-mycorrhizal (NM). Plants were grown at ambient or 2X ambient [CO2] in unshaded greenhouses for 11 weeks and fertilized daily with nutrient solution either without added P or with 2 mM P in a low-P soil. High P supply reduced AM colonization whereas elevated [CO2] counteracted the depressive effect of P on intraradical colonization and vesicle development. Seedlings grown at either elevated [CO2], high P or with G. intraradices had greater growth, net assimilation of CO2 (A(CO2)) in leaves, leaf water-use efficiency, leaf dry wt/area, leaf starch and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Root/whole plant dry wt ratio was decreased by elevated [CO2], P, and AM colonization. Mycorrhizal seedlings had higher leaf-P status but lower leaf N and K concentrations than nonmycorrhizal seedlings which was due to growth dilution effects. Starch in fibrous roots was increased by elevated [CO2] but reduced by G. intraradices, especially at low-P supply. In fibrous roots, elevated [CO2] had no effect on C/N, but AM colonization decreased C/N in both Citrus spp. grown at low-P supply. Overall, there were no species differences in growth or A(CO2). Mycorrhizas did not increase plant growth at ambient [CO2]. At elevated [CO2], however, mycorrhizas stimulated growth at both P levels in sour orange, the more mycorrhiza-dependent species, but only at low- P in sweet orange, the less dependent species. At low-P and elevated [CO2], colonization by the AM fungus increased A(CO2) in both species but more so in sour orange than in sweet orange. Leaf P and root N concentrations were increased more and root starch level was decreased less by AM in sour orange than in sweet orange. Thus, the additional [CO2] availability to mycorrhizal plants increased CO2 assimilation, growth and nutrient uptake over that of NM plants especially in sour orange under P limitation.2484^6^Murchie,E H^Sarrobert,C^Contard,P^Betsche,T^Foyer,C H^Galtier,N^1999^1^Overexpression of sucrose-phosphate synthase in tomato plants grown with CO2 enrichment leads to decreased foliar carbohydrate accumulation relative to untransformed controls^184^37^4^251-260^^^^^Apr^^^^^77271437^1584^243^244^3034^360^372^427^57^845^se plant growth at ambient [CO2].

Crop simulation models used in climate change studies should be capable of reproducing such changes in growth response to C-A with changes in environmental conditions. We propose that changes with soil water status in crop growth response to C-A can be simulated if stomatal resistance is considered to vary directly with air-leaf C-A gradient, inversely with leaf carboxylation rate, and exponentially with leaf turgor. Resistance simulated in this way increases with C-A relatively less, and CO2 fixation increases with C-A relatively more, under water-limited versus non-limited conditions. As part of the ecosystem model ecosys, this simulation technique caused changes in leaf conductance and CO2 fixation, and in canopy water potential, temperature and energy balance in a modelling experiment that were consistent with changes measured under 355 versus 550 mu mol mol(-1) C-A and low versus high irrigation in a free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment on wheat. Changes with C-A in simulated crop water relations allowed the model to reproduce under 550 mu mol mol(-1) C-A and low versus high irrigation a measured increase of 20 versus 10% in seasonal wheat biomass, and a measured decrease of 2 versus 5% in seasonal evapotranspiration, The basic nature of the processes simulated in this model is intended to enable its use under a wide range of soil, management and climate conditions.

We describe a simple simulation model for an ecosystem containing a generic nonfixer and a symbiotic N fixer, based on: (1) a higher cost for N acquisition by N fixers than nonfixers; (2) growth of fixers and fixation of N only when low N availability limits the growth of nonfixers, and other resources are available; and (3) losses of fixed N from the system only when the quantity of available N exceeds plant and microbial demands. Despite the disadvantages faced by the N fixer under these conditions, N fixation and loss adjust N availability close to the availability of other resources, and biomass and NPP in this simple model can be substantially but only transiently N limited. We then modify the model by adding: (1) losses of N in forms other than excess available N (e.g., dissolved organic N, trace gases produced by nitrification); and (2) constraints to the growth and activity of N fixers imposed by differential effects of shading, P limitation, and grazing. The combination of these processes is sufficient to describe an open system, with input from both precipitation and N fixation, that is nevertheless strongly N-limited at equilibrium. This model is useful for exploring causes and consequences of constraints to N fixation, and hence of N limitation, and we believe it will also be useful for evaluating how N fixation and limitation interact with elevated CO2 and other components of global enviromental change.2487^1^Gruters,U^1999^1^On the role of wheat stem reserves when source-sink balance is disturbed by elevated CO2^292^73^1-2^55-62^^^^^May^^^^^7733130^2051^417^434^435^92^ces, and biomass and NPP in this simple model can be substantially but only transiently N limited.

Minaret) was exposed to 360 and 680 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 in open top chambers during the vegetation periods of 1994/1995. In 1994 fractionated harvests were carried out at weekly intervals from the onset of stem elongation,. At final harvest CO, enhanced aboveground biomass and yield by 49.7 and 43.2%, respectively. From all plant organs stem dry weights showed the largest increases under doubled CO2, whereas leaf-blade dry weights increased only slightly. Since stems are known as sites of intermediary carbohydrate-storage, carbohydrate composition was analysed in the internodes of the main stem. Carbohydrates were determined as fructans, sucrose and reducing sugars. CO2 stimulated the amounts per organ of all components, but fructans showed the largest increases. Fructan accumulation lasted about one week longer and remobilisation was faster under elevated CO2. The results are consistent with current knowledge, that temporary storage pools accomodate source photosynthate supply to sink demand and suggested a predominant role of the intermediary stem reserves, when source-sink relations are changed under elevated CO2. The contribution of the main stem reserves to the main stem yield was also enhanced by elevated CO2 (6.1-8.7% compared to 10.0-14.2%). In 1995 growth and yield increase due to elevated CO2 (50.6 and 53%) was comparable to 1994. A functional growth analysis of the stem dry weight was carried out in this year. There was only a slightly longer accumulation phase in response to elevated CO2. Combined stem reserves contributed 12-18% to the final grain yield thereby contradicting, the suggestions based on the results of the year 1994.2488^2^Ambus,P^Robertson,G P^1999^1^Fluxes of CH4 and N2O in aspen stands grown under ambient and twice-ambient CO2^206^209^1^1-8^^^^^^^^^^77351030^1298^1599^3019^3327^3573^3574^374^376^398^n was faster under elevated CO2.

We measured fluxes of CH4 and N2O in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands grown in open-top chambers under ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations crossed with `high' and low soil-N conditions. Flux measurements with small static chambers indicated net CH4 oxidation in the open-top chambers. Across dates, CH4 oxidation activity was significantly (P < 0.05) greater with ambient CO2 (8.7 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1)) than with elevated CO2 (6.5 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1)) in the low N soil. Likewise, across dates and soil N treatments CH4 was oxidized more rapidly (P < 0.05) in chambers with ambient CO2 (9.5 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1)) than in chambers with elevated CO2 (8.8 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1)). Methane oxidation in soils incubated in serum bottles did not show any response to the CO2 treatment. We suggest that the depressed CH4 oxidation under elevated CO2 in the field chambers is due to soil moisture which tended to be higher in the twice-ambient CO2 treatment than in the ambient CO2 treatment. Phase I denitrification (denitrification enzyme activity) was 12-26% greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in the `high' N soil; one sampling, however, showed a 39% lower enzyme activity with elevated CO2. In both soil N treatments, denitrification potentials measured after 24 or 48 h were between 11% and 21% greater (P < 0.05) with twice- ambient CO2 than with ambient CO2. Fluxes of N2O in the open- top chambers and in separate 44 cm(2) cores +/-N fertilization were not affected by CO2 treatment and soil N status. Our data show that elevated atmospheric CO2 may have a negative effect on terrestrial CH4 oxidation. The data also indicated temporary greater denitrification with elevated CO2 than with ambient CO2.

No down- regulation of photosynthesis was found after six months of growth under elevated CO2. Photosynthetic rates at 15 degrees C or 35 degrees C were also higher in elevated than in ambient CO2-grown plants, when measured at their respective CO2 growth condition. Stomata of elevated CO2-grown plants were less responsive to temperature as compared to ambient CO2 plants. The after effect of a heat-shock treatment (4 h at 45 degrees C in a chamber with 80% of relative humidity and 800-1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photon flux density) on A(max) was less in elevated than in ambient CO2-grown plants. At the photochemical level, the negative effect of the heat-shock treatment was slightly more pronounced in ambient than in elevated CO2-grown plants. A greater tolerance to oxidative stress caused by high temperatures in elevated CO2-grown plants, in comparison to ambient CO2 plants, is suggested by the increase in superoxide dismutase activity, after 1 h at 45 degrees C, as well as its relatively high activity after 2 and 4 h of the heat shock in the elevated CO2-grown plants in contrast with the decrease to residual levels of superoxide dismutase activity in ambient CO2-grown plants immediately after 1 h at 45 degrees C. The observed increase in catalase after 1 h at 45 degrees C in both ambient and elevated CO2-grown plants, can be ascribed to the higher rates of photorespiration and respiration under this high temperature.2490^4^Telewski,F W^Swanson,R T^Strain,B R^Burns,J M^1999^1^Wood properties and ring width responses to long-term atmospheric CO2 enrichment in field-grown loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)^9^22^2^213-219^^^^^Feb^^^^^77391203^1655^227^243^312^3575^372^423^669^751^lightly more pronounced in ambient than in elevated CO2-grown plants.

A third replicate of trees were grown without chambers at ambient pCO(2). Wood anatomy, wood density and tree ring width were analysed using stem wood samples. No significant differences were observed in the cell wall to cell lumen ratio within the latewood of the third growth ring formed in 1994. No significant differences were observed in the density of resin canals or in the ratio of resin canal cross- sectional area to xylem area within the same growth ring. Ring widths were significantly wider in the CO2-enrichment treatment for 3 of 4 years compared to the ambient chamber control treatment. Latewood in the 1995 growth ring was significantly wider than that in the ambient control and represented a larger percentage of the total growth-ring width. Carbon dioxide enrichment also significantly increased the total wood specific gravity (determined by displacement). However, when determined as total sample wood density by X-ray densitometry, the density of enriched samples was not significantly higher than that of the ambient chamber controls. Only the 1993 growth ring of enriched trees had a significantly higher maximum latewood density than that of trees grown on non-chambered plots or ambient chambered controls. No significant differences were observed in the minimum earlywood density of individual growth rings between chambered treatments.

Two experiments were performed, one with plants without flower buds, and another with plants which were flowering. Measurements were made on healthy and diseased leaves at the CO2 levels (35 Pa or 90 Pa) at which the plants were grown. There were no losses of chlorophyll, or any signs of visible chlorosis or necrosis due to infection. Lower numbers of bacteria were found in leaves at high CO2, suggesting growth at elevated CO2 created a less favourable condition in the leaf for bacterial growth. Although high CO2 lowered the bacterial number in infected leaves, reductions in photosynthesis and export were greater than at ambient CO2. The capacity of infected source leaves to export photoassimilates at rates observed in the controls was reduced in both light and darkness. In summary, the severity of infection on source leaf function by the bacteria was increased, rather than reduced by CO2 enrichment, underscoring the need for further assessment of plant diseases and bacterial virulence in plants growing under varying CO2 levels.2492^4^Lovelock,C E^Virgo,A^Popp,M^Winter,K^1999^1^Effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis, growth and reproduction of branches of the tropical canopy tree species, Luehea seemannii Tr. & Planch^9^22^1^49-59^^^^^Jan^^^^^7743312^344^3576^374^376^384^385^407^508^669^or necrosis due to infection.

Small open-top chambers were used to enclose branchlets that were at a height of between 20 and 25 m in the canopy of the tree species Luehea seemannii Tr. & Planch. in a tropical forest in Panama. Elevated concentrations of CO2 increased the rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreased stomatal conductance of leaves, but did not influence the growth of leaf area per chamber, the production of flower buds and fruit nor the concentration of nonstructural carbohydrates within leaves. The production of flower buds was highly correlated with the leaf area produced in the second flush of leaves, indicating that the branchlets of mature trees of Luehea seemannii are autonomous to a considerable extent. Elevated levels of CO2 did increase the concentration of nonstructural carbohydrates in woody stem tissue. Elevated CO2 concentration also they increased the ratio of leaf area to total biomass of branchlets, and tended to reduce individual fruit weight. These data suggest that the biomass allocation patterns of mature trees may change under future elevated levels of CO2. Although there were no effects on growth during the experiment, the possibility of increased growth in the season following CO2 enrichment due to increased carbohydrate concentrations in woody tissue cannot be excluded.2493^3^Griffin,K L^Sims,D A^Seemann,J R^1999^1^Altered night-time CO2 concentration affects the growth, physiology and biochemistry of soybean^9^22^1^91-99^^^^^Jan^^^^^7745243^2514^3577^367^389^417^430^448^733^749^uction of flower buds was highly correlated with the leaf area produced in the second flush of leaves, indicating that the branchlets of mature trees of Luehea seemannii are autonomous to a considerable extent.

During the vegetative growth phase few physiological differences were observed between plants exposed to a constant 24 h [CO2] (250/250 and 1000/1000) and those that were switched to a higher or lower [CO2] at night (250/1000 and 1000/250), suggesting that the primary physiological responses of plants to growth in elevated [CO2] is apparently a response to daytime [CO2] only. However, by the end of the reproductive growth phase, major differences were observed. Plants grown in the 1000/250 regime, when compared with those in the 1000/1000 regime, had significantly more leaf area and leaf mass, 27% more total plant dry mass, but only 18% of the fruit mass. After 12 weeks of growth these plants also had 19% higher respiration rates and 32% lower photosynthetic rates than the 1000/1000 plants. As a result the ratio of carbon gain to carbon loss was reduced significantly in the plants exposed to the reduced night-time [CO2]. Plants grown in the opposite switching environment, 250/1000 versus 250/250, showed no major differences in biomass accumulation or allocation with the exception of a significant increase in the amount of leaf mass per unit area. Physiologically, those plants exposed to elevated night-time [CO2] had 21% lower respiration rates, 14% lower photosynthetic rates and a significant increase in the ratio of carbon gain to carbon loss, again when compared with the 250/250 plants. Biochemical differences also were found. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase concentrations decreased in the 250/1000 treatment compared with the 250/250 plants, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity decreased in the 1000/250 compared with the 1000/1000 plants. Glucose, fructose and to a lesser extent sucrose concentrations also were reduced in the 1000/250 treatment compared with the 1000/1000 plants. These results indicate that experimental protocols that do not maintain elevated CO2 levels 24 h d(-1) can have significant effects on plant biomass, carbon allocation and physiology, at least for fast-growing annual crop plants. Furthermore, the results suggest some plant processes other than photosynthesis are sensitive to [CO2] and under ecologically relevant conditions, such as high night-time [CO2], whole plant carbon balance can be affected.2494^5^Ito,J^Hasegawa,S^Fujita,K^Ogasawara,S^Fujiwara,T^1999^1^Effect of CO2 enrichment on fruit growth and quality in Japanese pear (Pyrus serotina reheder cv.

At different stages of fruit growth, pear trees were exposed to an elevated CO2 concentration (130 Pa CO2) along with a control (35 Pa CO2). For one group of plants, CO2 enrichment was applied for 79 d from 52 d after full bloom (DAB) to fruit maturity (long-term CO2 enrichment) and for another group the same treatment was applied for 35 d from 96 DAB to fruit maturity (short-term CO2 enrichment). The effects of the elevated CO2 concentration on vegetative growth, mineral contents, and fruit production and quality were examined. Long- term CO2 enrichment enhanced vegetative growth, without any significant effect on the mineral contents in either flower bud or fruit except for a remarkable increase in the K content. Long-term CO2 enrichment increased the fruit size and fresh weight, but had no significant effect on the fruit quality. On the other hand, the short-term CO2 enrichment did not induce any significant change in the fruit size but increased the fruit sugar concentration. Along with the reduction of the sorbitol concentration in fruit, the fructose and sucrose concentrations increased and these changes occurred earlier at elevated CO2 than at ambient CO2 concentrations. From these results, we concluded that the effect of CO2 enrichment on fruit growth varies depending upon the growth stages of fruit: during the initial and fruitlet stages when fruit expansion occurs, CO2 enrichment increases the fruit size, whereas, during maturation when fruit expansion has slowed down and sugar accumulation in fruit is active, it increases the fruit sugar concentration.2495^4^Owensby,C E^Ham,J M^Knapp,A K^Auen,L M^1999^1^Biomass production and species composition change in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem after long-term exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2^127^5^5^497-506^^^^^Jun^^^^^7749t, but had no significant effect o1044^312^3579^374^56^57^715^740^91^956^the short-term CO2 enrichment did not induce any significant change in the fruit size but increased the fruit sugar concentration.

Plots in open-top chambers (4.5 m diameter) were exposed continuously (24 h) to ambient and elevated CO2 from early April to late October each year. Unchambered plots were monitored also. Aboveground peak biomass was determined by clipping each year in early August, and root growth was estimated by harvesting roots from root ingrowth bags. Plant community composition was censused each year in early June. In the last 2 years of the study, subplots were clipped on 1 June or 1 July, and regrowth was harvested on 1 October. Volumetric soil water content of the 0-100 cm soil layer was determined using neutron scattering, and was generally higher in elevated CO2 plots than ambient. Peak aboveground biomass was greater on elevated CO2 plots than ambient CO2 plots with or without chambers during years with significant plant water stress. Above-ground regrowth biomass was greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in a year with late-season water stress, but did not differ in a wetter year.

The basal cover and relative amount of warm-season perennial grasses (C4) in the stand changed little during the 8-year period, but basal cover and relative amount of cool-season perennial grasses (C3) in the stand declined in the elevated CO2 plots and in ambient CO2 plots with chambers. Forbs (C3) and members of the Cyperaceae (C3) increased in basal cover and relative amount in the stand at elevated compared to ambient CO2.

We investigated how elevated CO2 influenced the response of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) seedlings to variation in soil moisture. Seedlings were grown for four months on a soil moisture gradient, individually and in mixed species stands, in controlled environment facilities at ambient (375 mu L L-1) and elevated (700 mu L L-1) atmospheric CO2. For both individually and competitively grown paper birch seedlings, there was a greater CO2 growth enhancement for seedlings watered less frequently than for well-watered seedlings. This differential change in CO2 responsiveness across the moisture gradient reduced the difference in seedling growth between high and low water levels and effectively broadened the regeneration niche of paper birch. In contrast, for yellow birch seedlings, elevated CO2 only produced a significant growth enhancement at the wet end of the soil moisture gradient, and increased the size difference between seedlings at the two ends of the gradient. Gas exchange measurements showed that paper birch seedlings were more sensitive than yellow birch seedlings to declines in soil moisture, and that elevated CO2 reduced this sensitivity. Additionally, elevated CO2 improved survival of yellow birch seedlings growing in competition with paper birch in dry stands. Thus, elevated CO2 may influence regeneration patterns of paper birch and yellow birch on sites of differing soil moisture. In the future, as atmospheric CO2 levels rise, growth of paper birch seedlings and survival of yellow birch seedlings may be enhanced on xeric sites, while yellow birch may show improved growth on mesic sites.nt reduced the difference in seedling growth between high and low water levels and effectively broadened the regeneration niche of paper birch.

Yecora Rojo] was grown from December 1992 to May 1993 under two atmospheric CO2 concentrations, 550 mu mol mol(-1) for high-CO2 plots, and 370 mu mol mol(-1) for control plots, using a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) apparatus. In addition to the two levels of atmospheric CO2, there were ample and limiting levels of water supply through a subsurface trip irrigation system in a strip, split-plot design. In order to examine the temporal and spatial root distribution, root cores were extracted at six growth stages during the season at in-row and inter-row positions using a soil core device (86 mm ID, 1.0 m length). Such information would help determine whether and to what extent root morphology is changed by alteration of two important factors, atmospheric CO2 and soil water, in this agricultural ecosystem. Wheat root growth increased under elevated CO2 conditions during all observed developmental stages. A maximum of 37% increase in total root dry mass in the FACE vs. Control plots was observed during the period of stem elongation. Greater root growth rates were calculated due to CO2 enhancement until anthesis. During the early vegetative growth, root dry mass of the inter-row space was significantly higher for FACE than for Control treatments suggesting that elevated CO2 promoted the production of first-order lateral roots per main axis. Then, during the reproductive period of growth, more branching of lateral roots in the FACE treatment occurred due to water stress. Significant higher root dry mass was measured in the inter-row space of the FACE plots where soil water supply was limiting. These sequential responses in root growth and morphology to elevated CO2 and reduced soil water supports the hypothesis that plants grown in a high-CO2 environment may better compensate soil-water-stress conditions.stem.

There was no significant effect of CO2 concentration on sheath, leaf and root biomass and leaf area in the early spring (January to April). 24-h canopy CO2 exchange rate (CCER) was not significantly affected either. However, elevated CO2 concentration increased CCER at midday, decreased evapotranspiration rate and increased instantaneous water-use- efficiency during early spring. Leaf, sheath and root nitrogen concentration per unit dry weight decreased and nonstructural carbohydrate concentration increased under elevated CO2, and N- uptake per unit ground area decreased significantly (-22%) towards the end of this period. These results contrast with results from the final harvest, when grain yield and biomass were increased by 19% under elevated CO2. N concentration per dry weight was reduced by 5%, but N-uptake per unit ground area was significantly higher (+11%) for the elevated CO2 treatment. 24-h and midday-CCER increased significantly more in late spring (period of 21 April to 30 May) (respectively by + 40% and 53%) than in the early spring (respectively 5% and 19%) in response to elevated CO2.

We conclude that the low response to CO2 concentration during the early spring was associated with a growth-restriction, caused by low temperature and irradiance levels. The reduction of nitrogen concentration, the increase of nonstructural carbohydrate, and the lower evapotranspiration indicated that CO2 did have an effect towards the end of early spring; but not on biomass accumulation.

For two cultivars of rice (cvs. Lemont and IR-72), methane emissions increased with a temperature increase of 2 degrees, from outdoor ambient temperatures to the first cell of the ambient CO2 tunnel (ambient temperature + 2 degrees C). Within both tunnels and for both cultivars methane emissions decreased with further temperature increases (from 2 degrees to 5 degrees C above ambient). Carbon dioxide enrichment stimulated both above- and below-ground production. Our original hypothesis was that increased CO2 would stimulate plant productivity and therefore stimulate methane emission, since direct linkages between these parameters have been observed. We hypothesize that CO2 enrichment led to the attenuation of methane production due to increased delivery of oxygen to the rhizosphere because of increased root biomass and porosity. The increased root biomass due to elevated CO2 may have more effectively aerated the soil, suppressing methane production. However, this study may be unique because the low organic content (<1%) of the sandy soils in which the rice was grown created very little oxygen demand.2500^2^Naidu,S L^DeLucia,E H^1999^1^First-year growth response of trees in an intact forest exposed to elevated CO2^127^5^5^609-613^^^^^Jun^^^^^77592093^243^312^344^361^384^417^437^483^57^ emissions decreased with further temperature increases (from 2 degrees to 5 degrees C above ambient).

These effects were studied in a glasshouse experiment with peat monoliths cored from an oligotrophic pine fen. The cores with living plants were kept in 720 ppm(v) and 360 ppm(v) CO2 atmospheres for about 6 months under imitated natural temperature cycle. Fertilisation with NH4NO3 (3 g m(-2) for 25 weeks) was applied to 18 of the 36 monoliths. The rate of CH4 flux was non-linearly dependent on the number of Eriophorum vaginatum shoots growing in the monoliths, probably due to the gas transport properties of the aerenchyma. The average CH4 efflux rate, standardised by the number of shoots, was increased by a maximum of 10-20% in response to the raised CO2 level. In the raised-NH4NO3 treatment, the increase in CH4 release was lower. The effect of combined CO2 + NH4NO3 on CH4 release was negligible and even lower than in the single treatments. Both potential CH4 production and oxidation rates at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C were higher near the surface than at the bottom of the core. As expected, the rates clearly depended on the incubation temperature, but the different treatments did not cause any consistent differences in either CH4 production or oxidation. The determination of potential CH4 production and oxidation in the laboratory is evidently too crude a method of differentiating substrate-induced differences in CH4 production and oxidation in vivo. These results indicate that an increase in atmospheric CO2 or N supply alone, at least in the short term, slightly enhances CH4 effluxes from boreal peatlands; but together their effect may even be restrictive.2502^3^McDonald,E P^Agrell,J^Lindroth,R L^1999^1^CO2 and light effects on deciduous trees: growth, foliar chemistry, and insect performance^2^119^3^389-399^^^^^May^^^^^77631088^1089^1090^1091^2971^2975^3186^690^715^733^CH4 release was negligible and even lower than in the single treatments.

Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) were grown in controlled environment greenhouses under ambient or elevated CO2 (38.7 and 69.6 Pa), and low or high light availability (375 and 855 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Because CO2 and light are both required for carbon assimilation, the levels of these two resources are expected to have strong interactive effects on tree growth and secondary metabolism. Results from this study support that prediction, indicating that the relative effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the growth and secondary metabolism of deciduous trees may be dependent on light environment. Trees in ambient CO2-low light environments had substantial levels of phytochemicals despite low growth rates; the concept of basal secondary metabolism is proposed to explain allocation to secondary metabolites under growth-limiting conditions. Differences between CO2 and light effects on the responses of growth and secondary metabolite levels suggest that relative allocation is not dependent solely on the amount of carbon assimilated. The relative growth rates and indices of feeding efficiency for gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) larvae fed foliage from the experimental treatments showed no significant interactive effects of light and CO2, although some main effects and many host species interactions were significant.

At ripening temperature, CO2 inhibited ethylene production, but 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate (ACC) oxidase activity was similar to that in ripe control fruits. CO2 treatment led to a decline in putrescine (Put) and a major accumulation of spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) without any effect on arginine decarboxylase (ADC) activity. These results confirm the preferential transformation of Put to Spd and Spm in CO2-treated fruits. At chilling temperature, the increase in ACC oxidase activity was inhibited and the V-max of ADC increased. A combination of chilling temperature storage and high CO2 level led to suppression of basal ethylene production while ACC oxidase activity remained unchanged. In addition, fruits held at these conditions had higher polyamine titres than the untreated control.

In addition, at the same stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration might be higher under CE which results in higher photosynthetic rate.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increased photosynthesis, tended to decrease stomatal conductance, and increased water-use efficiency (WUE). Although soil resource availability influenced gas exchange measurements, it generally did not affect the magnitude or direction of the response to CO2 concentration. However, significant interactions among treatment variables Here observed for plant xylem pressure potential. In seedlings grown with high N, a positive growth response to elevated atmospheric CO2 increased whole-plant water use resulting in more severe plant water stress, despite increased leaf-level WUE; however, under low N conditions the lark of a growth response to elevated CO2 reduced wholeplant water use, decreased water stress severity, and increased WUE. Photosynthetic response to CO2 was greatest in the high N treatment at the beginning of the drought cycle, but diminished as water stress increased: however, plants grown with low N showed greater photosynthetic responses to CO2 later in the drought cycle. Therefore, plant gas exchange rates interact with growth response in determining the severity of water stress under drought and, thus, the ability of elevated atmospheric CO2 to ameliorate the effects of drought and allow plants to maintain increased rates of photosynthesis mag be influenced bq the availability of other resources, such as N and water.2509^4^Sims,D A^Cheng,W X^Luo,Y Q^Seemann,J R^1999^1^Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 in a sunflower canopy^78^50^334^645-653^^^^^May^^^^^7777188^344^356^384^385^417^430^449^813^92^ere plant water stress, despite increased leaf-level WUE; however, under low N conditions the lark of a growth response to elevated CO2 reA^7776^Sunflower canopies were grown in mesocosom gas exchange chambers at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (360 and 700 ppm) and leaf photosynthetic capacities measured at several depths within each canopy. Elevated [CO2] had little effect on whole-canopy photosynthetic capacity and total leaf area, but had marked effects on the distribution of photosynthetic capacity and leaf area within the canopy. Elevated [CO2] did not significantly reduce the photosynthetic capacities per unit leaf area of young leaves at the top of the canopy, but it did reduce the photosynthetic capacities of older leaves by as much as 40%. This effect was not dependent on the canopy light environment since elevated [CO2] also reduced the photosynthetic capacities of older leaves exposed to full sun on the south edge of the canopy. In addition to the effects on leaf photosynthetic capacity, elevated [CO2] shifted the distribution of leaf area within the canopy so that more leaf area was concentrated near the top of the canopy. This change resulted in as much as a 50% reduction in photon flux density in the upper portions of the elevated [CO2] canopy relative to the ambient [CO2] canopy, even though there was no significant difference in the total canopy leaf area. This reduction in PFD appeared to account for leaf carbohydrate contents that were actually lower for many of the shaded leaves in the elevated as opposed to the ambient [CO2] canopy.

Xanthi) with altered chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) content were grown under ambient or under doubled atmospheric CO2 in order to analyse the effect of elevated CO2 on the redox state of the chloroplasts. Since large differences exist between the individual leaves of tobacco plants, gas exchange characteristics, enzyme capacities and metabolite contents were measured separately for each leaf of the plants, Large variations between leaves of different age were found in nearly every parameter analysed, and the differences between younger and older leaves were, in most cases, larger than the differences between comparable leaves at ambient or elevated CO2. For all parameters (chlorophyll fluorescence, P700 reduction, NADP-MDH activation) that are indicative for the redox situation in the electron transport chains and in the chloroplast stroma, more oxidized values were determined under elevated CO2. The increased redox state of ferredoxin, observed at ambient conditions in the NADP-MDH-under-expressing plants, disappeared under elevated CO2. It was concluded that the reduced rate of photorespiration under elevated CO2 decreases the amount of excess electrons. Interestingly, this lowered not only the activation state of NADP-MDH, but also the expression of the enzyme in the wild-type plants. The results are discussed with respect to a possible interaction between stromal reduction state and gene expression.2511^3^Mayr,C^Miller,M^Insam,H^1999^1^Elevated CO2 alters community-level physiological profiles and enzyme activities in alpine grassland^389^36^1-2^35-43^^^^^May^^^^^77811334^2034^2426^344^3595^364^374^376^407^789^ble leaves at ambient or elevated CO2.

A canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) followed by multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant effect of elevated CO2 on the CLPPs both under fertilized and unfertilized conditions.

Although we found no changes in total soil organic matter under elevated CO2, we did find that after physical fractionation the amount of organic C in the supernatant (< 0.2 mu m) and the amount of water extractable organic C (WEOC) was lower under elevated CO2. The extractable optical density (OD) indicated a higher degree of humification for the elevated than for the ambient CO2 samples (P = 0.032). Microbial biomass C was not significantly altered under high CO2, but total bacterial counts were significantly higher. The microbial biomass C-to-N ratio was also higher at elevated (15.0) than at ambient CO2 (10.0). The number of mycorrhizal spores was lower at high CO2, but ergosterol contents and fungal hyphal lengths were not significantly affected. Changes were found neither in community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) nor in the structural attributes (phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs) of the microbial community. Overall, the effects on the soil microbiota were small, perhaps as a result of the low nutrient supply and low organic matter content of the soil used in our study. The few significant results showing changes in specific, though relatively minor, organic matter pools may point to possible long-term changes of the more major pools. Furthermore, the data suggest increased competition between plants and microbes for N at high CO2. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Seedlings were grown in growth chambers maintained at either 350 mu mol mol(-1) or 710 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Seedlings were inoculated with Rhizobium spp. and were grown with or without AM fungi. The N-15 isotope dilution method was used to determine N source partitioning between N, fixation and inorganic fertilizer uptake. Elevated atmospheric CO2 significantly increased the percentage of fine roots that were colonized by AM fungi. Mycorrhizal seedlings grown under elevated CO2 had the greatest overall plant biomass production, nodulation, N and P content, and root N absorption. Additionally, elevated CO2 levels enhanced nodule and root mass production, as well as N, fixation rates, of nonmycorrhizal seedlings. However, the relative response of biomass production to CO2 enrichment was greater in non-mycorrhizal seedlings than in mycorrhizal seedlings. This study provides strong evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in the extent to which plant nutrition of symbiotic N-2-fixing tree species is affected by enriched atmospheric CO2.2515^11^DeLucia,E H^Hamilton,J G^Naidu,S L^Thomas,R B^Andrews,J A^Finzi,A^Lavine,M^Matamala,R^Mohan,J E^Hendrey,G R^Schlesinger,W H^1999^1^Net primary production of a forest ecosystem with experimental CO2 enrichment^32^284^5417^1177-1179^^^^^14 May^^^^^77891045^1655^1998^227^3599^372^374^413^483^738^icantly increased the percentage of fine roots that were colonized by AM fungi.

After 2 years the growth rate of the dominant pine trees increased by about 26 percent relative to trees under ambient conditions. Carbon dioxide enrichment also increased Litterfall and fine- root increment. These changes increased the total net primary production by 25 percent. Such an increase in forest net primary production globally would fix about 50 percent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. The response of this young, rapidly growing forest to carbon dioxide may represent the upper Limit for forest carbon sequestration.2516^2^Jauhiainen,J^Silvola,J^1999^1^Photosynthesis of Sphagnum fuscum at long-term raised CO2 concentrations^390^36^1^11-19^^^^^^^^^^77913001^312^3206^344^360^3600^3601^372^528^73^ngA^7790^Rate of net photosynthesis in Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.)

Three climate scenarios were simulated: baseline (present) climate with ambient CO2 and 2 future climates derived from the general circulation models OSU and GFDL-Q with elevated atmospheric CO2. For baseline climate, the aggregation error of the national (U.S.) study area was very small, -0.4%. Forest-level aggregation error ranged from -1.6 to 11.8%, with the largest aggregation error occurring in boreal forest types. Coarse grid resolution inputs underestimated production for boreal and forested boreal wetland forests and overestimated net primary production (NPP) for temperate conifer, temperate deciduous, and temper ate forested wetland forests. Aggregation error for coarse grid cells ranged between -25.6 and 27.3%. Aggregation errors were especially large in transition regions between temperate and boreal forest types. An analysis that homogenized inputs for the 10 km grid cells within a 50 km grid indicated that aggregation of forest types and air temperature from fine to coarse grid cells contributed most to the spatial aggregation error. The aggregation error for the OSU climate was similar to the GFDL-Q climate and both results were similar to the aggregation error of the baseline climate in magnitude, sign, and spatial pattern. While aggregation error was similar across the baseline, GFDL-Q and OSU scenarios, NPP response to the GFDL-Q and OSU climates increased 13 to 30% above the baseline NPP. Within each climate scenario, the estimated NPP response to climate change differed by less than 1% between the coarse and fine resolutions. Except for transition regions and regions with substantial variability in air temperature, our simulations indicate that the use of 0.5 degrees resolution provides an acceptable level of aggregation error at the 3 scales of analysis in this study. Improvements could be made by focusing computational intensity in heterogeneous regions and avoid computational intensity in regions that are relatively homogeneous with respect to vegetation and air temperature.2518^4^Wayne,P M^Carnelli,A L^Connolly,J^Bazzaz,F A^1999^1^The density dependence of plant responses to elevated CO2^12^87^2^183-192^^^^^Apr^^^^^7795312^33^344^376^792^797^975^error of the baseline climate in magnitude, sign, and spatial pattern.

The specific objective of this research was to examine the below-ground respiratory responses of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) seedlings to elevated atmospheric [CO2] and temperature. Red maple and sugar maple seedlings were planted in the ground in each of 12 open-top chambers and exposed from 1994 through 1997 to ambient air or air enriched with 30 Pa CO2, in combination with ambient or elevated (+4 degrees C) air temperatures. Carbon dioxide efflux was measured around the base of the seedlings and from root-exclusion zones at intervals during 1995 and 1996 and early 1997. The CO2 efflux rates averaged 0.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the root-exclusion zones and 0.75 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s-1 around the base of the seedlings. Mineral soil respiration in root-exclusion zones averaged 12% higher in the high temperature treatments than at ambient temperature, but was not affected by CO2 treatments. The fraction of total efflux attributable to root + rhizosphere respiration ranged from 14 to 61% in measurements made around red maple plants, and from 35 to 62% around sugar maple plants. Root respiration rates ranged from 0 to 0.94 mu mol CO2 s(-1) m(-2) of soil surface in red maple and from 0 to 1.02 in sugar maple. In both 1995 and 1996 root respiration rates of red maple were highest in high-CO2 treatments and lowest in high temperature treatments. Specific red maple root respiration rates of excised roots from near the soil surface in 1996 were also highest under CO2 enrichment and lowest in high temperature treatments. In sugar maple the highest rates of CO2 efflux were from around the base of plants exposed to both high temperature and high-CO2, even though specific respiration rates were lowest for this species under the high temperature and CO2 enrichment regime. In both species, patterns of response to treatments were similar in root respiration and root mass, indicating that the root respiration responses were due in part to differences in root mass. The results underscore the need for separating the processes occurring in the roots from those in the forest floor and mineral soil in order to increase our understanding of the effects of global climate change on carbon sequestration and cycling in the below-ground systems of forests.2521^2^Weigel,H J^Dammgen,U^1999^1^The Braunschweig carbon project - atmospheric flux monitoring and free air carbon dioxide enrichment^391^77^1^49-58^^^^^Mar^^^^^7801372^374^407^417^661^il surface in 1996 were also highest under CO2 enrichment and lowest in high temperature treatments.

This is also true for carbon fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. As increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will directly affect plant photosynthesis, plant biomass production and plant water relations, it is of particular importance to predict the dynamics of carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and agricultural canopies and the related consequences for agroecosystems under future atmospheric CO2 conditions. There are hardly any experimental approaches under real field conditions in crop rotation systems to simulate future CO2 scenarios.

The response of the plants to the various treatments was investigated by means of the leaf development during the growing season. At the end of the vegetation period leaf area and leaf dry weight per single leaf and per plant were measured. At the beginning of the growing period the provenances differed significantly in the mean leaf number, leaf area and leaf dry weight per plant. The area per single leaf is - in Contrast to leaf dry weight and the specific leaf area - similar among all seven provenances. The light has an effect on all measured leaf parameters. In full light the leaf development started very early. Leaf number, leaf area, and leaf dry weight per single leaf and per plant decrease and specific leaf area increases under low light conditions. In the treatment "elevated CO2 environment and full irradiance" leaf number, leaf area and leaf dry weight per single leaf and per plant increased too. At reduced irradiance a higher CO2 content does not influence the measured leaf parameters. The results show already at this early stage that genetic variation is important and the climatic factors influencing plant growth and elevated CO2 interact strongly. For an overall view of the plants' reaction to growth conditions, investigations of the gas exchange of the leaves and anatomical and morphological studies will be added.2523^6^Potosnak,M J^Wofsy,S C^Denning,A S^Conway,T J^Munger,J W^Barnes,D H^1999^1^Influence of biotic exchange and combustion sources on atmospheric CO2 concentrations in New England from observations at a forest flux tower^278^104^D8^9561-9569^^^^^27 Apr^^^^^7805312^pment started very early.

The time series is decomposed into contributions due to regional combustion, local canopy exchange, monthly average regional biotic exchange (as modulated by the daily cycle of growth and decay of the planetary boundary layer (PBL)), and the regional monthly background concentration Attributions are derived using time series analysis, data for a tracer for combustion (CO or acetylene (C2H2)), and measurements of indicators of proximate canopy exchange (CO2 flux and momentum flux). Results are compared to observations at Cold Bay, Alaska. Combustion contributes on average 4-5 ppm to ambient CO2 at Harvard Forest in winter and 2-3 ppm in summer. Regional biotic emissions elevate daily mean CO2 by 4-6 ppm in winter, and the covariance of the biotic cycle of uptake and emission with PBL height enhances daily mean CO2 by 1-2 ppm in summer; minimum values in late afternoon average 10 ppm lower than at Cold Bay in summer.

When the mesocosms were sealed and subjected to step- wise changes in atmospheric CO2 between daily means of 450 and 900 mu mol mol(-1), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was derived using the diurnal changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The step-wise CO2 treatment was effectively replicated as indicated by the high repeatability of NEE measurements under similar CO2 concentrations over a 12-week period. In the rainforest mesocosm, daily NEE was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments because of much higher enhancement of canopy CO2 assimilation relative to the increase in the nighttime ecosystem respiration under high CO2. Furthermore, the response of daytime NEE to increasing atmospheric CO2, in this mesocosm was not linear, with a saturation concentration of 750 mu mol mol(-1). In the desert mesocosm, a combination of a reduction in ecosystem respiration and a small increase in canopy CO2 assimilation in the high CO2 treatments also enhanced daily NEE. Although soil respiration was not affected by the short-term change in atmospheric CO2 in either mesocosm, plant dark respiration was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments in the rainforest mesocosm while the opposite was found in the desert mesocosm. The high CO2 treatments increased the ecosystem light compensation points in both mesocosms. High CO2 significantly increased ecosystem radiation use efficiency in the rainforest mesocosm, but had a much smaller effect in the desert mesocosm.

Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration could favor some genotypes of this species over others if there exists intraspecific variation in the responsiveness of survivorship to CO2. To investigate such variation, we studied effects of CO2 enrichment on seedling survival in response to uniform rates of soil water depletion in six maternal families of honey mesquite (P. glandulosa Torr. var, glandulosa). Three families each from the arid and mesic extremes of the species' distribution in the southwestern United States were studied in environmentally controlled glasshouses. Relative water content at turgor loss and osmotic potential were not affected by CO2 treatment. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, however, increased growth, leaf production and area, and midday xylem pressure potential, and apparently reduced transpiration per unit leaf area of seedlings as soil dried. Consequently, CO2 enrichment about doubled the fraction of seedlings that survived soil water depletion. Maternal families of honey mesquite differed in percentage survival of drought and in several other characteristics, but differences were of similar or of smaller magnitude compared with differences between CO2 treatments. There was no evidence for genetic variation in the responsiveness of survivorship to CO2. By increasing seedling survival of drought, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration could increase the abundance of honey mesquite where establishment is limited by water availability. Genetic types with superior ability to survive drought today, however, apparently will maintain that advantage in the future.2526^3^Talkkari,A^Kellomaki,S^Peltola,H^1999^1^Bridging a gap between a gap model and a physiological model for calculating the effect of temperature on forest growth under boreal conditions^45^119^1-3^137-150^^^^^28 Jun^^^^^7811243^2677^269^3607^3608^372^504^605^611^614^gsA^7810^The applicability of the parabolic function of the Jabowa gap model for the relationship between tree growth and temperature sum for aggregating short-term temperatures responses was investigated by determining parameter values for the temperature function in a gap model from material generated by means of a physiological model (Kellomaki et al,, 1993; Kellomaki and Vaisanen, 1997), in which the growth and development of a tree stand is linked with the climate and soil through photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and the uptake of water and nitrogen. Predictions of stand volume and total stand production were compared using the following functions for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.): (i) the original parabolic function of the Jabowa model with parameter values based on the geographical distribution of trees (TO), (ii) the same parabolic function with parameter values obtained by fitting data generated using the physiological model (T1), and (iii) a fit of a truncated parabolic function to data generated using the physiological model (T2). The differences in volume and total production between the functions were greater at the site in northern Finland than at the sites in southern and central Finland, although absolute timber production was lowest at the northern site. The stand volume and timber production were highest at all three sites with the truncated parabola (T2) under conditions of climate change. Total production following climate change (average of TO, T1, and T2) was an average of 104% of that observed under current climatic conditions at the southern site, 105% at the central site and 121% at the northern site. The gap model was not found to be sensitive to the growing degree-days (gdd) response curve when the model was applied to Finnish conditions, and thus appeared to be satisfactory for aggregating the short-term physiological responses of Scots pine to temperature.

We also studied the effects of CO2 on the concentration of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and nitrogen (N), two parameters hypothesized to be linked to flavonoid metabolism. Throughout the growth cycle the concentration of isoorientin, the most abundant flavonoid, decreased by 62% (from an average of 12.5 mg g(-1) on day of year (DOY) 41 to an average of 4.8 mg g(-1) on DOY 123), whereas the concentration of tricin, another characteristic flavone, increased by two orders of magnitude (from an average of 0.007 mg g(-1) of isoorientin equivalents on DOY 41 to an average of 0.6 mg g(-1) of isoorientin equivalents on DIOY 123). Although flavonoid concentration was dependent on growth stage, the effects of treatments on phenology did not invalidate the comparisons between treatments. CO2-enriched plants had higher flavonoid concentrations (14% more isoorientin, an average of 7.0 mg g(-1) for ambient CO2 vs an average of 8.0 mg g(-1) for enriched CO2), higher TNC concentrations and lower N concentrations in upper canopy leaves throughout the growth cycle. Well-irrigated plants had higher flavonoid concentrations (11% more isoorientin, an average of 7.1 mg g(-1) for half watered vs an average of 7.9 mg g(-1) for well-watered) throughout the growth cycle, whereas the effect of irrigation treatments on TNC and N was more variable. These results are in accordance with the hypotheses that higher carbon availability promoted by CO2-enrichment provides carbon that can be invested in carbon-based secondary compounds such as flavonoids.

Seedlings were harvested at 5-7 weeks interval. CO2 treatment had a positive effect on seedling growth. Differences in biomass between elevated and ambient CO2-treated plants increased over the experimental period. Soil N availability did not significantly affect growth. Nevertheless, growth in elevated [CO2] in combination with high N levels led to a consistently higher accumulation of total biomass by the end of the experiment (30-40 %). Biomass allocation between plant parts was similar for seedlings in all treatments, but was significantly different between harvests. The N regimes did not result in different relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), while CO2 treatment had an overall significant effect.

The response of the plants eo the various treatments was investigated by means of the leaf development during the growing season. At the end of the vegetation period leaf area and leaf dry weight per single leaf and per plant were measured. At the beginning of the growing period the provenances differed significantly in height and at the end of the vegetation period also in the mean leaf number, leaf area and leaf dry weight per plant. The area per single leaf is - in contrast to leaf dry weight and the specific leaf area - similar among all seven provenances. The light has an effect on all measured leaf parameters.

Open-top chambers (OTCs) increase temperature by 1-3 degrees C. If temperature and CO2 interact in their effect on crops, this would limit the value of OTC experiments. Furthermore, interaction of CO2 and temperature deserves study because increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration are expected to cause global warming. This paper describes two experiments in which a recently developed cooling system for OTCs was used to analyse the effects of temperature on photosynthesis, growth and yield of spring wheat (Triticum nestivum L., cv. Minaret). Two levels of CO2 were used (350 and 700 ppm), and two levels of temperature, with cooled OTCs being 1.6-2.4 degrees C colder than noncooled OTCs. Photosynthetic rates were increased by elevated CO2, but no effect of temperature was found. Cross-switching CO2 concentrations as well as determination of A-Ci curves showed that plant photosynthetic capacity after anthesis acclimated to elevated CO2. The acclimation may be related to the effects of CO2 on tissue composition: elevated CO2 decreased leaf nitrogen concentrations and increased sugar content. Calculations of the seasonal mean crop light-use efficiency (LUE) were consistent with the photosynthesis data in that CO2 increased LUE by 20% on average whereas temperature had no effect. Both elevating CO2 and cooling increased grain yield, by an average of 11% and 23%, respectively. CO2 and temperature stimulated yield via different mechanisms: CO2 increased photosynthetic rate, but decreased crop light interception capacity (LAI), whereas cooling increased grain yield by increasing LAI and extending the growing season with 10 days. The effects of CO2 and temperature were not additive: the CO2 effect was about doubled in the noncooled open-top chambers. In most cases, effects on yield were mediated through increased grain density rather than increased individual grain weights.

Forages were grown in four temperature-gradient greenhouses on a natural Grossarenic Paleudult soil profile at temperatures of 0.2, 1.5, 2.9, and 4.5 degrees C above ambient, and at [CO2] of 365 and 640 mu L CO2 L-1 air.

Although elevated [CO2] yielded the greatest total plant biomass in 'high' nitrogen treatment, it resulted in lower leaf nutrient concentrations in all cases, independent of the nutrient addition regime, and in greater nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations. By contrast, nitrogen treatment did not affect foliar N concentrations, but resulted in lower phosphorus concentrations, suggesting that under lower N, P use-efficiency in foliar biomass production was lower. Phosphorus deficiency was evident in all treatments, as photosynthesis became CO2 insensitive at intercellular CO2 concentrations larger than approximate to 300 mu mol mol-l, and net assimilation rates measured at an ambient [CO2] of 350 mu mol mol(-1) or at 700 mu mol mol(-1) were not significantly different. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of foliar P with maximum Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) carboxylase activity (V-cmax), which potentially limits photosynthesis at low [CO2], and the capacities of photosynthetic electron transport (J(max)) and phosphate utilization (P-max), which are potentially limiting at high [CO2]. None of these potential limits was correlated with foliar nitrogen concentration, indicating that photosynthetic N use-efficiency was directly dependent on foliar P availability. Though the tendencies were towards lower capacities of potential limitations of photosynthesis in high [CO2] grown specimens, the effects were statistically insignificant, because of (i) large within-treatment variability related to foliar P, and (ii) small decreases in P/N ratio with increasing [CO2], resulting in balanced changes in other foliar compounds potentially limiting carbon acquisition. The results of the current study indicate that under P-deficiency, the down-regulation of excess biochemical capacities proceeds in a similar manner in leaves grown under normal and elevated [CO2], and also that foliar P/N ratios for optimum photosynthesis are likely to increase with increasing growth CO2 concentrations.2537^5^Li,J H^Sagi,M^Gale,J^Volokita,M^Novoplansky,A^1999^1^Response of tomato plants to saline water as affected by carbon dioxide supplementation.

Plants were grown under either low (355 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (1200 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 and were irrigated with low concentrations of mixed salts. The highest salinity level (E.C. 7 dS m(-1)) was that used to produce quality tomatoes in the Negev highlands, in Israel. During early development (three weeks after planting), the net photosynthetic rate of the leaves was much higher under elevated CO2, and other than a slight decrease in quantum yield efficiency as measured by fluorescence (Delta F/F-m'), no signs of acclimation to high levels of CO2 were apparent. Clear acclimation to high CO2 concentration was evident ten weeks after planting when the net photosynthetic rate, photosynthetic capacity, and carboxylation efficiency of leaves of non-salinized plants were strongly suppressed under elevated CO2. This was accompanied by reductions in carboxylation efficiency, Rubisco activity and PSII quantum yield, and an increased accumulation of leaf soluble sugars. The reduction in photosynthetic capacity in the high CO2 plants was less in plants grown at the highest salinity level. This was correlated with an increase in the PSII quantum yield parameters (F-v/F-m) and Delta F/F-m') but not with Rubisco activity which was affected by the Cat treatments only.

From 2 August (panicle initiation) to 22 August (booting), measurements were made of dry and wet bulb temperatures, canopy surface temperatures (T- c) and net radiation along with evapotranspiration (E) measurements by microlysimeters. Aerodynamic resistance (r(a)), obtained from the measured E and microclimate data, showed a fairly constant value (11.7 s m(-1). Then, r(a), T-c and microclimates data were substituted into energy budget equations to obtain E and canopy resistance (r(c)). In all plots, calculated E was in good agreement with measurement by lysimeters, and r(c) reached minimum values (r(c,min)) at solar radiation above 500 W m(-2). Elevated [CO2] at the lowest temperature plot increased r(c,min) by 40-49% and T-c by 1.4- 1.6 degrees C and it reduced E by 14-16% of those under ambient CO2 conditions. With the rising growth temperature, these effects of elevated [CO2] drastically decreased. The observed r(c,min) responses to temperature and [CO2] seemed to have reflected a long-term acclimation of rice to these environments. These results indicate that anticipated global warming significantly reduces the advantageous effects of elevated [CO2] on plant water use.2541^1^Beaudry,R M^1999^1^Effect of O-2 and CO2 partial pressure on selected phenomena affecting fruit and vegetable quality^259^15^3^293-303^^^^^Mar^^^^^78411012^1234^2475^3622^3623^3624^3625^3626^3627^560^ and microclimates data were substituted into energy budget equations to obtain E and canopy resistance (r(c)).

However, active, commercial modification of the atmosphere for the preservation of fresh fruit and vegetables dates to the early part of this century. Early successes with apple fruit has lead to the attempt to apply modified atmospheres to a wide range of commodities. Responses to atmospheric modification are found to vary dramatically among plant species, organ type and developmental stage and include both unwanted and beneficial physiological responses, Desirable responses include a reduction in respiration, a reduction in oxidative tissue damage or discoloration, a reduction in the rate of chlorophyll degradation and a reduction in ethylene sensitivity with the concomitant reduction in the rate of ripening and other ethylene-mediated phenomena. Undesirable responses have included the induction of fermentation, the development of disagreeable flavors? a reduction in aroma biosynthesis, the induction of tissue injury and an alteration in the makeup of microbial fauna.

We evaluated the effect of elevated soil temperatures on C losses from a forest Spodosol by incubating soil cores from surface (Oa + A + E) and subsurface (Bhs) horizons at two seasonal temperature regimes. One regime simulated the normal course of soil temperatures in northern lower Michigan, and the other simulated soil temperatures representing an amount of warming that might occur under some global warming theory calculations. We measured the amounts of CO2-C respired and dissolved organic C leached from the soil cores during a 33-wk period. Microbial respiration rates, after adjustment for variation in initial rates, were significantly increased by soil warming and were greater in surface than in subsurface horizons. Warming significantly increased cumulative C respired, with greater losses from surface soils (greater than or equal to 50 mg C g(-1) C) as compared with subsurface soils (less than or equal to 25 mg C g(-1) C). Mean quantities of dissolved organic C leached, ranging from 2.3 to 3.2 mg C g(-1) C, did not differ significantly by soil horizon or temperature regime. Increased microbial respiration in surface soil horizons was the process most responsive to soil warming in the Spodosol samples we examined. Whether this is a short-term effect that would disappear once pools of labile C are exhausted, or represents a long-term response to soil warming, remains uncertain.2543^2^Ward,J K^Strain,B R^1999^1^Elevated CO2 studies: past, present and future^13^19^4-5^211-220^^^^^Apr^^^^^78451980^2056^2346^256^2832^341^344^384^713^777^eriod.

To examine biochemical and morphological factors that might regulate the long-term photosynthetic response of field-grown trees to elevated CO2, we grew ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) trees in open-top chambers for six years in native soil at ambient CO2 (35 Pa) and elevated CO2 (70 Pa) at a site near Placerville, CA. Trees were well watered and exposed to natural light and ambient temperature. At the end of the sixth growing season at elevated CO2, net photosynthesis was enhanced 53%, despite reductions in photosynthetic capacity. The positive net photosynthetic response to elevated CO2 reflected greater relative increases in Rubisco sensitivity compared with the decreases resulting from biochemical adjustments. Analyses of net photosynthetic rate versus internal CO2 partial pressure curves indicated that reductions in photosynthetic capacity in response to elevated CO2 were the result of significant reductions in maximum photosynthetic rate (20%), Rubisco carboxylation capacity (36%), and electron transport capacity (21%). Decreased photosynthetic capacity was accompanied by reductions in various photosynthetic components, including total chlorophyll (24%), Rubisco protein content (38%), and mass-based leaf nitrogen concentration (14%). Net photosynthesis was unaffected by morphological adjustments because there was no change in leaf mass per unit area at elevated CO2. An apparent positive response of photosynthetic adjustment in the elevated CO2 treatment was the redistribution of N within the photosynthetic system to balance Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport capacities. We conclude that trees, without apparent limitations to root growth, may exhibit photosynthetic adjustment responses in the field after long-term exposure to elevated CO2.2545^5^Li,J H^Dijkstra,P^Hinkle,C R^Wheeler,R M^Drake,B G^1999^1^Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration in the Florida scrub-oak species Quercus geminata and Quercus myrtifolia growing in their native environment^13^19^4-5^229-234^^^^^Apr^^^^^7849312^342^345^348^376^384^546^92^ty was accompanied by reductions in various photosynthetic components, including total chlorophyll (24%), Rubisco protein content (38%), and mass-based leaf nitrogen concentration (14%).

Plants of both species were grown in open-top chambers in their natural habitat at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Compared to ambient CO2, elevated CO2 stimulated photosynthetic rates by 73 and 51% for Q. geminata and Q. myrtifolia, respectively. Maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) was significantly reduced by elevated CO2 in Q. myrtifolia (28%) but not in Q. geminata. Maximum rate of potential electron transport (J(max)) was not significantly reduced by elevated CO2 in either species. In response to elevated CO2, specific leaf area decreased in Q, myrtifolia (22%), but not in Q. geminata. Elevated CO:! caused a significant accumulation of sugars (54%) and starch (264%) in Q, myrtifolia leaves, but not in Q. geminata leaves. Total Rubisco activity in Q. myrtifolia leaves was reduced 40% by elevated CO2, whereas no significant reduction occurred in Q, geminata leaves.

We examined the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature on the light response of photosynthesis in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) seedlings. Seedlings were grown in sunlit chambers controlled to track either ambient (similar to 400 ppm) CO2 or ambient + 200 ppm CO2, at ambient temperature or ambient +4 degrees C. Photosynthetic light response curves were measured over an 18-month period beginning 32 months after treatments were initiated. Light-response curves were measured at the growth CO2 concentration, and were used to calculate the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, light compensation point, quantum yield and respiration rate. Elevated CO2 increased apparent quantum yields during two of five measurement periods, but did not significantly affect light- saturated net photosynthetic rates, light compensation points or respiration rates. Elevated temperature increased all parameters. There were no significant interactions between CO2 concentration and temperature. We conclude that down-regulation of photosynthesis occurred in the elevated CO2 treatments such that carbon uptake at a given irradiance was similar across CO2 treatments. In contrast, increasing temperature may substantially increase carbon uptake rates in Douglas-fir, assuming other environmental factors do not limit photosynthesis; however, it is not clear whether the increased carbon uptake will increase growth rates or be offset by increased carbon efflux through respiration.2547^2^Gonzalez-Meler,M A^Siedow,J N^1999^1^Direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes by elevated CO2: does it matter at the tissue or whole-plant level?^13^19^4-5^253-259^^^^^Apr^^^^^78531259^1260^243^344^364^374^389^524^749^92^uring two of five measurement periods, but did not significantlA^7852^On average, a doubling in current atmospheric [CO2] results in a 15 to 20% direct inhibition of respiration, although the variability associated with this value is large within and among species. Direct effects of CO2 on respiration may also be relevant to tree canopies because of dynamic fluctuations between nighttime and daytime [CO2] throughout the growing season. The mechanism by which CO2 inhibits respiration is not known. A doubling of ambient [CO2] inhibits the activity of the mitochondrial enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase. If inhibition of these enzymes is the only factor involved in the direct inhibition of respiration, the overall inhibition of specific respiration will be proportional to the control that such enzymes exert on the overall respiratory rate. We analyzed the effects of [CO2] on respiration in an attempt to scale the direct effects of CO2 on respiratory enzymes to the whole-plant level. Sensitivity analysis showed that inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes by doubling current atmospheric [CO2] does not explain entirely the CO2 inhibition of tissue or whole-plant respiration. We conclude that CO2-dependent suppression of respiratory enzymatic activity will be minimal when cytochrome c oxidase inhibition is scaled up from the mitochondria to the whole tree and that the primary mechanism for the direct inhibitory effect remains to be identified.2548^4^Tognetti,R^Longobucco,A^Miglietta,F^Raschi,A^1999^1^Water relations, stomatal response and transpiration of Quercus pubescens trees during summer in a Mediterranean carbon dioxide spring^13^19^4-5^261-270^^^^^Apr^^^^^78551285^2060^3127^3128^3129^344^3631^372^384^708^ overall inhibition of specific respiration will be proportional to the control that such enzymes exert on the overall respiratory rate.

Trees at the CO2 spring site have been growing for generations in elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The heat-pulse velocity technique was used to estimate water use of trees during a 5-month period from June to November 1994. At the end of the sap flow measurements, the trees were harvested and foliage and sapwood area measured. At both sites, maximum leaf conductance was related to predawn shoot water potential. Effects of summer drought on plant water relations, including whole-plant transpiration, were severe, but leaf conductance and water potential recovered to predrought values after major rainfall in September. Leaf conductance, predawn water potential, and sometimes sap flow, decreased in parallel with increases in hydraulic resistance, reaching a minimum in midsummer. Hydraulic resistance was higher in trees at the control site than in trees at the CO2 spring site. The effect of elevated CO2 concentration on leaf conductance was less at high leaf-to-air water vapor pressure difference than at low leaf-to-air water vapor pressure difference. Mean and diurnal sap fluxes were consistently higher in trees at the control site than in trees at the CO2 spring site. During the summer period, plant water use varied between the two sites. Trees at the control site had consistently higher sap flow at corresponding values of sapwood cross-sectional area than trees at the CO2 spring site. Because trees at the CO2 spring site supported a smaller foliage area for a corresponding sapwood cross-sectional area than trees at the control site, the overall mean sap flux/foliage area ratio did not differ between sites.

Xylem embolism was evaluated in both artificially dehydrated branches and in hydrated apical branches collected at monthly intervals during a 20-month sampling period. Initial specific hydraulic conductivity was also evaluated. We found species-dependent differences in xylem hydraulic properties in response to elevated CO2 concentration. Populus tremula was the most embolized and A. unedo was the least embolized of the species examined. Effects of elevated CO2 were significant in Q. pubescens, P. tremula and A. unedo, whereas the overall response to elevated CO2 was less evident in F, ornus and Q. ilex. Specific hydraulic conductivity differed among species but not between sites, although. the interaction between species and site was significant. Differences in xylem vulnerability between trees growing near to the CO2 spring and those growing in control areas were small. Although differences in hydraulic properties in response to elevated CO2 concentration were small, they may be of great importance in determining future community composition in Mediterranean-type forest ecosystems.

DiA^7858^The development of the Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facilities represents a substantial advance in experimental technology for studying ecosystem responses to elevated CO2. A challenge arising from the application of this technology is the utilization of short-term FACE results for predicting long- term ecosystem responses. This modeling study was designed to explore interactions of various processes on ecosystem productivity at elevated CO2 on the decadal scale. We used a forest model (FORDYN) to analyze CO2 responses-particularly soil nitrogen dynamics, carbon production and storage-of a loblolly pine ecosystem in the Duke University Forest. When a 14-year-old stand was exposed to elevated CO2, simulated increases in annual net primary productivity (NPP) were 13, 10 and 7.5% in Years 1, 2 and 10, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. Carbon storage increased by 4% in trees and 9.2% in soil in Year 10 in response to elevated CO2. When the ecosystem was exposed to elevated CO2 from the beginning of forest regrowth, annual NPP and carbon storage in trees and soil were increased by 32, 18 and 20%, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. In addition, simulation of a 20% increase in mineralization rate led to a slight increase in biomass growth and carbon storage, but the simulated 20% increase in fine root turnover rate considerably increased annual NPP and carbon storage in soil. The modeling results indicated that (1) stimulation of NPP and carbon storage by elevated CO2, is transient and (2) effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem processes-canopy development, soil nitrogen mineralization and root turnover-have great impacts on ecosystem C dynamics.

Phenological observations and measurements of height and stem diameter growth, absolute and relative growth rates, starch and soluble carbohydrate concentrations of the needles, and crown structure and needle properties were made at frequent intervals throughout the two growing seasons. Elevated CO2 significantly advanced the date of bud burst in both years. The increase in total needle area in response to elevated CO2 was accounted for by longer shoots and an increase in individual needle area in the first year, and by an increase in the number and length of shoots in the second year. Stem diameter and tree height were enhanced more by the elevated CO2 treatment in the first year than in the second, indicating a decreased effect of CO2 on growth over time. This was confirmed by a study of absolute and relative growth rates of leader shoots. During the first growing season of CO2 enrichment, mean weekly relative growth rates over the growing season (RGR(m)) were significantly enhanced.

We also compared the N concentration of plant material of Quercus ilex L. and Q. pubescens Willd. growing in the vicinity of natural CO2-springs with that of the same species growing at a control site. In the short-term studies, elevated CO2 caused significant decreases in tissue N concentration and the extent of the decrease varied with species. Nitrogen amendment of the soil lessened the CO2-enrichment effect. Lignin concentration was modified by elevated CO2 and the effect was species specific, but no general positive or negative trend was evident. A comparison of trees growing under natural conditions near a natural CO2-spring and at a control site revealed no site differences in N concentration of the plant material. A comparison of published results on decomposition rates of litter produced in elevated atmospheric CO2 and in ambient air indicated that CO2 enrichment can cause both enhancements and decreases of carbon mineralization. We conclude that (1) long- term responses to elevated CO2 could differ from the results obtained from short-term studies and that (2) biodiversity could be an important factor altering the sign of the feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentration. We also discuss the implications of our finding of a long-term, inhibitory effect of the initial N concentration of litter on the decomposition rate of litter and its consequence on ecosystem feedback.2553^1^Cheng,W X^1999^1^Rhizosphere feedbacks in elevated CO2^13^19^4-5^313-320^^^^^Apr^^^^^7865137^178^2034^2426^2843^359^377^419^420^535^positive or negative trend was evident.

Plants grown in elevated CO2 substantially increase C input to the rhizosphere. Although it is known that elevated CO2 enhances rhizosphere respiration more than it enhances root biomass, the fate and function of this extra carbon input to the rhizosphere in response to elevated CO2 are not clear. Depending on specific plant and soil conditions, the increased carbon input to the rhizosphere can result in an increase, a decrease, or no effect on soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Three mechanisms may account for these inconsistent results: (1) the "preferential substrate utilization" hypothesis; (2) the "priming effect" hypothesis; and (3) the "competition" hypothesis, i.e., competition for mineral nutrients between plants and soil microorganisms. A microbial growth model is developed that quantitatively links the increased rhizosphere input in response to elevated CO2 with soil organic matter decomposition. The model incorporates the three proposed mechanisms, and simulates the complexity of the rhizosphere processes. The model also illustrates mechanistically the interactions among nitrogen availability, substrate quality, and microbial dynamics when the system is exposed to elevated CO2.2554^1^Johnson,D W^1999^1^Simulated nitrogen cycling response to elevated CO2 in Pinus taeda and mixed deciduous forests^13^19^4-5^321-327^^^^^Apr^^^^^78671113^1781^312^314^454^672^862^lt in an increase, a decrease, or no effect on soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization.

The simulations tested whether N limitation would prevent growth increases in response to elevated CO2, and whether growth responses to CO2 in N-limited systems could be facilitated by increasing the biomass/N ratio (reducing N concentration) or increasing litter N mineralization, or both. Nitrogen limitation precluded additional growth when target growth rates and litterfall were increased (simulating potential response to elevated CO2) at the Duke University site. At the Walker Branch site, increasing target growth and litterfall caused a 7% increase in growth. Reducing foliar N concentrations reduced growth because of N limitation created by reduced litter quality (C:N ratio), reduced decomposition and increased N accumulation on the forest floor. These effects were most pronounced at the Duke University site, because the forest floor N turnover rate was lower than at the Walker Branch site. Reducing wood N concentration allowed prolonged increases in growth because of greater biomass/N; however, N uptake was reduced, allowing greater N immobilization on the forest floor and in soil. Increased N mineralization caused increased growth at the Duke University site, but not at the Walker Branch site. These simulations pose the counterintuitive hypothesis that increased biogeochemical cycling of N (as a result of increased litterfall N) causes reduced growth in an N-limited system because of increased accumulations of N on the forest floor and in soil.

Apple plants (Mabs domestica), 1 year old, were exposed to [CO2] of 200, 360, 700, 1000, and 1600 mu l 1(-1) up to 8 days. Six groups of leaves (counted from the shoot apex): leaves 1-5 (sink), 6-7 (sink to source transition): 8-9 (sink to source transition), 10-11 (nearly-matured source), 21-22 (mid-age source), and 30-32 (aged source), were sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 8 days after [CO2] treatments for carbohydrate analysis. Increases in [CO2] from a sub-ambient (200 mu l 1(-1)) to an ambient level (360 mu l 1(- 1)) significantly increased the concentrations of sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, and fructose tested in all ages of leaves. Continuous increase in [CO2] from ambient to super-ambient levels up to 1600 mu l 1(-1) also increased sorbitol concentration by approximate to 50% in source leaves, but not in sink and sink to source transition leaves. Increases in [CO2] from 360 to 1600 mu l 1(-1), however, had little effect on sucrose content in all ages of leaves. Starch concentrations increased in all ages of leaves as [CO2] increased. Rapid starch increases (e.g. 5-, 6-, 20-, and 50-fold increases for leaf groups 1-5, 6-7, 10-11, and 21-22, respectively) occurred from 700 to 1600 mu l 1(-1) [CO2] during which increases in sorbitol concentration either ceased or slowed down.

Net height growth of seedlings was enhanced in the early period of exposure to high levels of CO2. However, when seedlings were exposed for a longer period of time to this high concentration, net height growth was inhibited. Decreased photosynthetic rate with elevated CO2 was observed when measured in the ambient CO2 over a long-term exposure of 6 months. In contrast, a significant increase in photosynthesis was noted for seedlings exposed to higher incubation temperature in either ambient or 720 ppm CO2 concentrations. The response of CO2 assimilation to internal Ci was indicated by the lower sensitivity in seedlings grown in elevated CO2 concentration. Though this response could also be found in a higher sensitivity in seedlings grown at higher temperature, the seedlings grown in normal conditions (ambient CO2 and temperature) were still more sensitive to CO2 assimilation response to internal Ci. This experiment suggests that: (1) exposure of seedlings to higher CO2 levels for longer periods may lead to a decrease in seedling height growth and photosynthetic rate, as well as decreasing sensitivity to changing internal CO2 concentrations; (2) the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of seedlings grown in an elevated CO2 concentration was higher than that for seedlings grown in ambient concentration.

This hypothesis was based on resource allocation theory which predicts increased production of plant secondary compounds when carbon is in excess of that required for growth. Monoterpene emission rates were measured from needles of (a) Ponderosa pine grown at different CO2 concentrations and soil nitrogen levels, and (b) Douglas fir grown at different CO2 concentrations. Ponderosa pine grown at 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 exhibited increased photosynthetic rates and needle starch to nitrogen (N) ratios when compared to trees grown at 350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Nitrogen availability had no consistent effect on photosynthesis. Douglas fir grown at 550 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 exhibited increased photosynthetic rates as compared to growth at 350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 in old, but not young needles, and there was no influence on the starch/N ratio. In neither species was there a significant effect of elevated growth CO2 on needle monoterpene concentration or emission rate. The influence of climate warming and leaf area index LAD on monoterpene emission were also investigated. Douglas fir grown at elevated CO2 plus a 4 degrees C increase in growth temperature exhibited no change in needle monoterpene concentration, despite a predicted 50% increase in emission rate. At elevated CO2 concentration the LAI increased in Ponderosa pine, but not Douglas fir. The combination of increased LAI and climate warming are predicted to cause an 80% increase in monoterpene emissions from Ponderosa pine forests and a 50% increase in emissions from Douglas fir forests.

Although the chamber pressure anomalies associated with this method are known to be a source of error, their effects have not been fully characterized. In this study, we use results from soil gas-exchange experiments and a soil CO2 transport model to characterize the effects of chamber pressure on soil CO2 efflux in an annual California grassland. For greater than ambient chamber pressures, experimental data show that soil-surface CO2 flux decreases as a nonlinear function of increasing chamber pressure; this decrease is larger for drier soils. In dry soil, a gauge pressure of 0.5 Pa reduced the measured soil CO2 efflux by roughly 70% relative to the control measurement at ambient pressure. Results from the soil CO2 transport model show that pressurizing the flux chamber above ambient pressure effectively flushes CO2 from the soil by generating a downward now of air through the soil air-filled pore space. This advective flow of air reduces the CO2 concentration gradient across the soil-atmosphere interface, resulting in a smaller diffusive flux into the chamber head space. Simulations also show that the reduction in diffusive flux is a function of chamber pressure, soil moisture, soil texture, the depth distribution of soil CO2 generation, and chamber diameter. These results highlight the need for caution in the interpretation of dynamic chamber trace gas flux measurements. A portion of the frequently observed increase in net ecosystem carbon uptake under elevated CO2 may be an artifact resulting from the impact of chamber pressurization on soil CO2 efflux.2561^3^Serraj,R^Allen,L H^Sinclair,T R^1999^1^Soybean leaf growth and gas exchange response to drought under carbon dioxide enrichment^127^5^3^283-291^^^^^Mar^^^^^78811163^130^243^3638^3639^407^409^422^546^674^chamber above ambient pressure effectively flushes CO2 from the soil by generating a downward now of air through the soil air-filled pore space.

We describe a prototype FACE system currently in operation in forest plots in a maturing loblolly pine(Pinus taeda L.) stand in North Carolina, USA. The system uses feedback control technology to control [CO2] in a 26 m diameter forest plot that is over 10 m tall, while monitoring the 3D plot volume to characterize the whole-stand CO2 regime achieved during enrichment. in the second summer season of operation of the FACE system, atmospheric CO2 enrichment was conducted in the forest during all daylight hours for 96.7% of the scheduled running time from 23 May to 14 October with a preset target [CO2] of 550 mu mol mol(-1), approximate to 200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]. The system provided spatial and temporal control of [CO2] similar to that reported for open-top chambers over trees, but without enclosing the vegetation. The daily average daytime [CO2] within the upper forest canopy at the centre of the FACE plot was 552 +/- 9 mu mol mol-l (mean +/- SD). The FACE system maintained I-minute average [CO2] to within +/- 110 mu mol mol(-1) of the target [CO2] for 92% of the operating time. Deviations of [CO2] outside of this range were short-lived (most lasting < 60 s) and rare, with fewer than 4 excursion events of a minute or longer per day. Acceptable spatial control of [CO2] by the system was achieved,,with over 90% of the entire canopy volume within +/- 10% of the target [CO2] over the exposure season. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was much higher than for open- top chambers on an absolute basis, but similar to that of open- top chambers and branch bag chambers on a per unit volume basis. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was strongly related to windspeed, averaging 50 g CO2 m(-3) h(-1) for thestand for an average windspeed of 1.5 m s(-1) during summer. The [CO2] control results show that the free-air approach is a tractable way to study long-term and short-term alterations in trace gases, even within entire tall forest ecosystems.

This study was designed to (i) assess whether the A-N relationship was more similar for species within than between community and vegetation types, and (ii) examine how growth at elevated CO2 affects the A-N relationship. Data were obtained for 39 C3 species grown at ambient CO2 and 10 C3 species grown at ambient and elevated CO2. A regression model was applied to each species as well as to species pooled within different community and vegetation types. Cluster analysis of the regression coefficients indicated that species measured at ambient CO2 did not separate into distinct groups matching community or vegetation type.

Six sequential harvests were taken in order to determine whether the effect of elevated CO2 on internal mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal production was independent of the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth. At a given time, elevated CO2 increased the percentage of root length colonized (RLC), the total length of colonized root and the external mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) density and decreased the ratio of EMH to total length of colonized root.

Assimilation as a function of increasing [CO2] at high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 1 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) indicated that leaf photosynthesis was not saturated under current ambient [CO2] for any of the three C-4 species.

Both NaCl salinity in the rhizosphere and atmospheric CO2 enrichment reduced the leaf content of total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, as well as stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, but raised intercellular CO2 concentration and C2H4 emission of leaves.

Sustained reduction in quantum efficiency, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m), in over- wintering leaves may be related to seasonal down-regulation of photosynthesis, combined with cumulative effects of freeze- induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, with the effect being greater in leaves grown under elevated [CO2]. Down- regulation of photosynthesis apparently occurred in response to seasonal limitations to growth which were not overcome by elevation of [CO2] despite temperatures being favorable for photosynthesis during most of the photoperiod. Elevated [CO2] had no effect on growth of over-wintering seedlings, but enhanced growth in spring when minimum temperatures rose consistently above freezing. As there were no effects of elevated [CO2] on allocation, the stimulation of growth in spring was attributable to increase in net assimilation rates. Thus seasonal differences in photoinhibition were consistent with seasonal differences in the capacity for growth, with plants grown under elevated [CO2] having to dissipate more excess excitation energy over-winter.2568^2^Ziska,L H^Bunce,J A^1999^1^Effect of elevated carbon dioxide concentration at night on the growth and gas exchange of selected C-4 species^92^26^1^71-77^^^^^^^^^^7895130^131^3178^3432^348^349^360^374^389^417^reater in leaves grown under elevated [CO2].

Of the four species tested, only A. retroflexus significantly increased both CO2 assimilation (+13%) and plant biomass (+21%) at continuous elevated relative to continuous ambient concentrations of CO2. This increase was not associated with improvement in leaf water potential during dark or light periods. In contrast, high CO2 only during the night significantly reduced plant biomass compared to the 24 h ambient CO2 treatment for both A. retroflexus and Z. mays. This indicates that the observed increase in biomass at elevated CO2 for A. retroflexus was not caused by a reduction of carbon loss at night (i.e. increased carbon conservation), but rather a direct stimulation of daytime CO2 assimilation, independent of any improvement in leaf water potential.2569^2^Polderdijk,J J^van den Boogaard,G J P M^1998^1^Effect of reduced levels of O-2 and elevated levels of CO2 on the quality of bunched radishes^172^63^6^250-253^^^^^Nov-Dec^^^^^7897e night-time rate of CO2 efflux at high night-time CO2 concentrations.

In plants that reproduce sexually, fitness can be described both by a female and a male component. Whereas the existence of genetic variation in the response to elevated CO2 of traits related to female fitness has been the focus of recent studies, studies on the response of the male component of fitness are still missing.

The phase change from juvenile to adult leaves is known to be associated with changes in resistance against plant pathogens and herbivores in several species. Virtually nothing is known about changes in resistance associated with the transition from embryonic tissue to autotrophic tissue in seedlings. We studied the consequences of transitions from cotyledons to juvenile true leaves to adult true leaves in cotton seedlings (Gossypium hirsutum) for their resistance to spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). Mite populations grew much more rapidly on cotyledons than on true leaves. However, there was no detectable difference in the population growth of mites on juvenile vs. adult true leaves. We suggest that population growth of mites is positively affected by the high rates of photosynthesis of cotyledons relative to true leaves, or by some process or attribute correlated with photosynthesis. Conditions that caused increased rates of photosynthesis (exposure to light and elevated concentrations of CO2) caused mite populations to increase. Greater mite population growth on cotyledons was not associated with stored reserves in the cotyledons, as the mites did poorly on cotyledons kept in the dark. This study indicates that phase changes can have profound effects on plant resistance to herbivores. Because the seedling stage is so vulnerable to herbivory and so critical to understanding plant population dynamics, a broader consideration of phase changes associated with seedlings is warranted.2575^5^Heagle,A S^Booker,F L^Miller,J E^Pursley,W A^Stefanski,L A^1999^1^Influence of daily carbon dioxide exposure duration and root environment on soybean response to elevated carbon dioxide^204^28^2^666-675^^^^^Mar-Apr^^^^^79091206^1262^264^3561^447^456^580^685^92^cted by the high rates of photosynthesis of cotyledons relative to true leaves, or by some process or attribute correlated with photosynthesis.

In one experiment, effects of 12 and 24 h d(-1) exposures to double-ambient CO2 were compared for plants grown in 14 L pots that were either insulated to moderate soil temperature or not insulated. Although never significant statistically, trends at some growth stages suggested that nighttime CO2 enrichment contributed to growth and yield. Plants grew and yielded more in insulated than noninsulated pots, but there were no significant CO2 enrichment X insulation interactions. In the second experiment, response to approximately 1.3, 1.6, and 1.9 times ambient CO2 was compared for plants grown in the ground or 14 L pots. Enhancement of photosynthesis, growth, and yield by CO2 enrichment was similar in pots and in the ground. Linear responses to different CO2 concentrations were significant for all yield components in both root environments, whereas quadratic responses were significant for plants in pots but not for plants in the ground. Tests of proportionality of response for yield components shelved no evidence of significant differences between plants in pots and in the ground except weight per 100 seeds. Seed yield enhancement at 1.9 times ambient CO2 was 36% for plants in pots and 33% for plants in the ground.

In particular, nitrogen oxides emitted during fuel combustion and ammonia volatilized as a result of intensive agriculture have increased atmospheric nitrogen inputs (mostly NO3 and NH4) to temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere(2-4). Because tree growth in northern temperate regions is typically nitrogen-limited(5), increased nitrogen deposition could have the effect of attenuating rising atmospheric CO2 by stimulating the accumulation of forest biomass. Forest inventories indicate that the carbon contents of northern forests have increased concurrently with nitrogen deposition since the 1950s(6-8). In addition, variations in atmospheric CO2 indicate a globally significant carbon sink in northern mid-latitude forest regions(9-12). It is unclear, however, whether elevated nitrogen deposition or other factors are the primary cause of carbon sequestration in northern forests.

Lighting was provided with fluorescent lamps as a 12 h photoperiod with 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR. Mid-day stomatal conductances for potato were greatest at 400 and 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) and least at 1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2.

Mid-dark period conductances for potato were significantly greater at 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) than at 400 or 1000 mu mol mol(-1), whereas dark conductance for wheat was similar in all CO2 treatments. Temporarily changing the CO2 concentration from the native 1000 mu mol mol(-1) to 400 mu mol mol(-1) increased mid-day conductance for all species, while temporarily changing from 1000 to 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) also increased conductance for potato and sweetpotato. Temporarily changing the dark period CO2 from 1000 to 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) increased conductance for potato, soybean and sweetpotato.

Canopy water use for potato was greatest at 10 000, intermediate at 400, and least at 1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, whereas canopy water use for wheat was greatest at 400 and similar at 1000 and 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Elevated CO2 treatments (i.e. 1000 and 10 000 mu mol mol(-1)) resulted in increased plant biomass for both wheat and potato relative to 400 mu mol mol(-1), and no injurious effects were apparent from the 10 000 mu mol mol(-1) treatment.

This process is demonstrated for Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data for more than 100 000 plots and nearly 3 million trees east of the 100th meridian were analyzed and aggregated to the county level to provide species importance values for each of more than 2100 counties. County-level data also were compiled on climate, soils, land use, elevation, and spatial pattern. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution and predict the potential future distributions under two scenarios of climate change (2 x CO2). RTA allows different variables to control importance value predictions at different regions, e.g. at the northern versus southern range limits of a species. RTA outputs represent the potential 'environmental envelope' shifts required by species, while the migration model predicts the more realistic shifts based on colonization probabilities from varying species abundances within a fragmented landscape. The model shows severely limited migration in regions of high forest fragmentation, particularly when the species is low in abundance near the range boundary. These tools are providing mechanisms for evaluating the relationships among various environmental and landscape factors associated with tree- species importance and potential migration in a changing global climate.

Assessment of the likely direction and magnitude of these impacts requires development of appropriate modelling capacities linked with experimental work. This paper documents the adaptation of an existing soil- pasture-livestock model, GRASP, to simulate system responses to changes in CO2. The adapted model is then used to compare these responses under current climate and CO2 conditions with four possible future scenarios: (1) doubled CO2; (2) doubled CO2 and increased temperature; (3) as in the previous scenario but with a drier climate; and (4) as in (2) but with a wetter climate. These studies suggest that CO2 changes alone are likely to have beneficial effects, with increased pasture growth, increased and less variable liveweight gain, and increased ground cover. However, subsoil drainage is likely to increase. Growth responses to CO2 are likely to be greater in drier years than in wetter years partly due to nitrogen limitations in the soils of the region. Increases in temperature in combination with CO2 further increased animal production due to the increased number of growing days in the cooler months. The increased rainfall scenario had few additional positive effects but further increased subsoil drainage. In contrast, the drier scenario had reduced plant and animal production when compared with current conditions even though seasonal transpiration efficiency was increased by 20% due to increased CO2.

Each model ecosystem was grown in a simulated montane climate, and was exposed to one of three CO2 concentrations (280, 420, and 560 mu l l(-1)) and to one of three levels of N deposition (0, 30, and 90 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) for 3 years. In the 3rd year of the experiment second to third instars of the nun moth (Lymantria monacha) were allowed to feed directly on current-year needles of top canopy branches of each tree for 13 days. Specific leaf area (SLA), water content, and N concentration decreased in needles exposed to elevated CO2, whereas the concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and total phenolics increased. Increased N deposition had no significant effect on SLA, and water content, but the concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and total phenolics decreased, and sugar and N concentrations increased. Despite higher relative consumption rates (RCRs) larvae consumed 33% less N per unit larval biomass and per day at the two high CO2 treatments, compared to those feeding on 280 mu l l(-1)-needles, but they maintained similar N accumulation rates due to increased N utilization efficiencies (NUE). However, over the 12-day experimental period larvae gained less N overall and reached a 35% lower biomass in the two high-CO2 treatments compared to those at 280 mu l l(-1). The effects of increased N deposition on needle quality and insect performance were generally opposite to those of CO enrichment, but were lower in magnitude. We conclude that altered needle quality in response to elevated CO2 will impair the growth and development of L. monacha larvae.

The simulation results were tested against field measurements with special emphasis on the period between anthesis and maturity. A model integrating leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was scaled to canopy level in order to be used in the wheat growth model. The simulated intercellular CO2 concentration, C-i, was determined from the ratio of C-i to the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, C-s, the leaf-to-air specific humidity deficit and a possibly unfulfilled transpiration demand, After anthesis, the measured assimilation rates of the flag leaves decreased more rapidly than their stomatal conductances, leading to a rise in the C-i/C-s ratio. In order to describe this observation, an empirical model approach was developed which took into account the leaf nitrogen content for the calculation of the C-i/C-s ratio. Simulation results obtained with the new model version were in good agreement with the measurements. If changes in the C-i/C-s ratio in accordance with the decrease in leaf nitrogen content during leaf senescence were not considered in the model, simulations revealed an underestimation of the daily canopy transpiration of up to 20% and a decrease in simulated seasonal canopy transpiration by 10%. The measured reduction in the seasonal sum of canopy transpiration and soil evaporation owing to CO2 enrichment, in comparison, was only about 5%. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2 increase water use efficiency of vegetation by improving growth rates and suppressing transpiration per unit leaf area. Highly cultivated crops without water or nutrient constraints are able to show the greatest growth improvements. In many natural or semi-natural ecosystems, under enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations, limits on the availability of soil nutrients severely constrains the possibility of improvements in growth and significant increases in leaf area index that could compensate for a decrease in transpiration per unit leaf area. Thus, in many natural or semi-natural ecosystems, which often form water gathering grounds in river basins, enhanced levels of CO2 will suppress transpiration and perhaps increase the proporation of precipitation that forms runoff or ground water. In low vegetation covers, such as grassland, the rates of transpiration and also evaporation from canopies that are wet after rainfall (interception loss) are very similar. In these canopies, evapotranspiration is unlikely to be significantly increased by small increases in leaf area index. It is suggested that the suppression of potential evapotranspiration by enhanced CO2 levels will be small, but that actual transpiration from tall, slow growing vegetation covers may be significantly suppressed. Thus for some vegetation covers the relationship between actual and potential evapotranspiration may be sensitive to CO2 levels. If this is so, it could be of importance to many water balance calculations. The suppression of evapotranspiration by enhanced CO2 levels will be most noticeable in dry climates where interception loss is insignificant and largely masked in very wet climates where a large proportion of evapotranspiration consists of interception loss.of precipitation that forms runoff or ground water.

Fewer studies have examined the effects of elevated CO2 on herbivory, and of these, most have examined feeding rates in laboratory conditions. Our study takes advantage of an open-top CO2 fertilization study in a Florida scrub-oak community to examine the effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore densities, herbivore feedings rates, and levels of attack of herbivores by natural enemies. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced plant foliar nitrogen concentrations, decreased abundance of leaf- mining insect herbivores, increased per capita leaf consumption by leafminers, and increased leaf miner mortality. As suggested by other authors, reduced foliar quality contributed to the increase in herbivore mortality, but only partly. The major factor increasing mortality was higher attack rate by parasitoids.

Changes in temperature or precipitation as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations could lead to changes in species distributions. In addition, climatic change could increase the frequency and severity of wildfires. We used a forest gap model developed for Sierra Nevada forests to investigate the potential sensitivity of these forests to climatic change, including a changing fire regime. Fuel moisture influences the fire regime and couples fire to climate. Fires are also affected by fuel loads, which accumulate according to forest structure and composition. These model features were used to investigate the complex interactions between climate, fire, and forest dynamics. Eight hypothetical climate-change scenarios were simulated, including two general circulation model (GCM) predictions of a 2 x CO2 world. The response of forest structure, species composition, and the fire regime to these changes in the climate were examined at four sites across an elevation gradient. Impacts on woody biomass and species composition as a result of climatic change were site specific and depended on the environmental constraints of a site and the environmental tolerances of the tree species simulated. Climatic change altered the fire regime both directly and indirectly. Fire frequency responded directly to climate's influence on fuel moisture, whereas fire extent was affected by changes that occurred in either woody biomass or species composition. The influence of species composition on fuel-bed bulk density was particularly important. Future fires in the Sierra Nevada could be both more frequent and of greater spatial extent if GCM predictions prove true.2586^4^Luo,Y Q^Reynolds,J^Wang,Y P^Wolfe,D^1999^1^A search for predictive understanding of plant responses to elevated [CO2]^127^5^2^143-156^^^^^Feb^^^^^79311260^1304^1660^343^356^377^685^692^715^975^ture, species composition, and the fire regime A^7930^This paper reviews two decades of effort by the scientific community in a search for predictive understanding of plant responses to elevated [CO2]. To evaluate the progress of research in leaf photosynthesis, plant respiration, root nutrient uptake, and carbon partitioning, we divided scientific activities into four phases: (I) initial assessments derived from our existing knowledge base to provide frameworks for experimental studies; (II) experimental tests of the initial assessments; (III) in cases where assessments were invalidated, synthesis of experimental results to stimulate alternative hypotheses and further experimentation; and (IV) formation of new knowledge. This paper suggests that photosynthetic research may have gone through all four phases, considering that (a) variable responses of photosynthesis to [CO2] are generally explainable, (b) extrapolation of leaf-level studies to the global scale has been examined, and (c) molecular studies are under way. Investigation of plant respiratory responses to [CO2] has reached the third phase: experimental results have been accumulated, and mechanistic approaches are being developed to examine alternative hypotheses in search for new concepts and/or new quantitative frameworks to understand respiratory responses to elevated [CO2]. The study of nutrient uptake kinetics is still in the second phase: experimental evidence has contradicted some of the initial assessments, and more experimental studies need to be designed before generalizations can be made. It is quite unfortunate that we have not made much progress in understanding mechanisms of carbon partitioning during the past two decades. This is due in part to the fact that some of the holistic theories, such as functional balance and optimality, have not evolved into testable hypotheses to guide experimental studies.

In this study, we applied a dual stable isotope approach to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and elevated temperature on these components of soil CO2 efflux in Douglas-fir terracosms. We measured both soil CO2 efflux rates and the C-13 and O-18 isotopic compositions of soil CO2 efflux in 12 sun-lit and environmentally controlled terracosms with 4- year-old Douglas fir seedlings and reconstructed forest soils under two CO2 concentrations (ambient and 200 ppmv above ambient) and two air temperature regimes (ambient and 4 degrees C above ambient). The stable isotope data were used to estimate the relative contributions of different components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. In most cases, litter decomposition was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in this system, followed by rhizosphere respiration and soil organic matter oxidation. Both elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated temperature stimulated rhizosphere respiration and litter decomposition. The oxidation of soil organic matter was stimulated only by increasing temperature. Release of newly fixed carbon as root respiration was the most responsive to elevated CO2, while soil organic matter decomposition was most responsive to increasing temperature.

In moA^7934^Local effects of climate change (CC) and elevated CO2 (2 x CO2, 660 mu mol mol(-1)) on managed temperate grasslands were assessed by forcing a dynamic ecosystem model with weather scenarios. The aims of the study were to compare the relative importance of individual and combined effects of CC, 2 x CO2, and photosynthetic acclimation, and to assess the importance of local site conditions. The model was driven by hourly means for temperature (T), precipitation (P), global radiation (G), vapour pressure (VP), and wind speed (U). Local climate scenarios were derived by statistical downscaling techniques from a 2 x CO2 simulation with the General Circulation Model of the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC-GCMII). Simulations over 14 growing seasons to account for year-to-year variability of climate were carried out for a low, relatively dry site, and a high, more humid site. At both sites, shoot dry matter responded positively to 2 x CO2 with the site at low elevation being more sensitive than the higher site. The effect of assumed changes in climate was negative at the lower, but positive at the higher site. Shoot dry matter was more sensitive to the effects of 2 x CO2 than to CC. Both effects combined increased shoot dry matter by up to 20%. This was attributed to direct effects of 2 x CO2 and increased T,and indirect stimulation via increased soil N availability. Biomass partitioning to roots increased with 2 x CO2 but decreased with CC, while an intermediate response resulted from the combination. Leaf area index (LAI) increased under 2 x CO2, but not enough to compensate fully for a decrease in leaf conductance. Under the 2 x CO2 scenario evapotranspiration (ET) decreased, but increased under CC. Photosynthetic acclimation reduced the effect of 2 x CO2 on shoot growth, but had little effect on ET. The seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) was improved under 2 x CO2, and reduced under CC. With the combination of both factors, the change was small but still positive, especially at the high elevation site with more favourable soil water conditions. This reflects the stronger positive yield response in combination with a smaller increase in ET under cooler, more humid conditions. The results for the combination of factors suggest that except for shoot growth, effects of 2 x CO2 and CC tend to offset each other. While CC determines the sign of the ET response, the sign of the biomass response is determined by 2 x CO2. The results highlight the importance of a site-specific analysis of ecosystem responses by using a flexible approach based on a combination of state- of-the-art downscaling, spatially resolved data sets, and a mechanistic model to obtain quantitative and reproducible assessments of climate change impacts at the ecosystem level.2589^3^Centritto,M^Lee,H S J^Jarvis,P G^1999^1^Interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and drought on cherry (Prunus avium) seedlings - I.

In the second growing season, the rapid onset of drought was imposed at the height of the growing season on the seedlings which had already experienced drought in the first growing season. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased total dry-mass production in both water regimes, but did not ameliorate the growth response to drought of the cherry seedlings subjected to two sequential drying cycles.

Stomatal conductance was significantly reduced in elevated [CO2]-grown, unstressed seedlings in both the first and second growing seasons, but was not caused by a decrease in stomatal density.

Larvae were reared in laboratory microcosms (simulated treeholes) with naturally- senesced, abscised foliage from seedlings of red oak (Quercus rubra) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) grown in ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 environments. Elevated CO2 did not have significant effects on any measure of mosquito performance. In contrast, host species and light availability had dramatic effects on mosquito development time and survival; light availability had additional effects on adult size. Mosquito reproductive potential (+/- SE) averaged 8.4 +/- 1.5 females female(-1) generation(-1) when litter input was from birch-sun leaves, but was 19.6 +/- 1.8 when the litter was from birch-shade leaves and 13.0 +/- 1.8 when from oak-sun leaves. Mosquito development time was nearly halved when the litter input was from oak-sun leaves versus birch-sun leaves, suggesting a potential for even greater demographic effects (e.g. two generations per year instead of one could yield a 20- fold increase in annual growth rate). Trophic transfer rates (mg insect detritivore g litter(-1) d(-1)) were 3-fold greater on birch-shade leaves than on birch-sun leaves. Changes in insolation and tree species composition can have important consequences for forest ecosystems, because of effects on litter quality that impact microbial saprobes and, ultimately, invertebrate detritivores.2592^3^Zamorano,J P^Alique,R^Canet,W^1999^1^Mechanical parameters to assess quality changes in cherimoya fruit^394^208^2^125-129^^^^^^^^^^79431000^3670^3671^454^ve potential (+/- SE) averaged 8.4 +/- 1.5 females female(-1) generation(-1) when litter input was from birch-sun leaves, but was 19.6 +/- 1.8 when the litter was frA^7942^Several mechanical parameters obtained by means of compression and penetration tests, and changes in cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) fruit quality during storage in air and two controlled atmospheres (CA), (3% O-2 + 0% CO2 and 3% O-2 + 3% CO?) were analysed.

The cores of S, fuscum were treated for 87 days and length increment was measured by the plastic strip method and by innate time markers, Water content of the shoot, dry mass of the capitulum, dry mass per unit length of stem and production of dry mass were measured at the end of the experiment. The water content, capitulum dry mass, dry mass per unit length of stem, length increment and dry mass production differed markedly for S. fuscum grown in different water levels. With lower water levels, the water content of the shoot decreased and the dry mass of both the capitulum and unit length of stem increased. The total length increment was highest when the water level was at or near the capitulum level (0-10 cm). No clear trend in dry mass production on an areal basis could be found due to uncoupled responses in length increment and stem dry mass at the experimental water levels. Neither capitulum dry mass nor dry mass per unit length of stem showed distinct trends in S. fuscum grown at different ambient CO2 concentrations. Some increase in length increment and in dry mass production was detected at CO2 concentrations above 350 ppm, but this effect appeared only at high water levels. It is suggested that the low response in length increment and production to CO2 concentration resulted in part from insufficient moisture for photosynthesis at the lower water levels. Also, the possibility of increased nonstructural production is discussed.2595^1^Staddon,P L^1998^1^Insights into mycorrhizal colonisation at elevated CO2: a simple carbon partitioning model^206^205^2^171-180^^^^^Aug^^^^^79491096^137^1843^344^362^3674^374^417^474^92^increment was highest when the water level was at or near the capitulum level (0-10 cm).

Belowground (root and fungus) carbon losses via respiration (and turnover) could also be manipulated. The specific objectives were to investigate the dynamic nature of the potential effects of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizal colonisation and to elucidate some of the various mechanisms by which these effects may be negated. Many of the simulations showed that time (i.e. plant age) had a more significant effect on the observed stimulation of mycorrhizal colonisation by elevated CO2 than changes in carbon allocation patterns or belowground carbon losses. There were two main mechanisms which negated a stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on internal mycorrhizal colonisation: an increased mycorrhizal carbon allocation to the external hyphal network and an increased rate of mycorrhizal respiration.

The crops are found to be more sensitive to higher cumulative heat units during cropping season. The yields respond substantially to temporal variations in rainfall (associated with observed swings in the continuity of monsoon). Prolonged dry spells at critical life stages of the soybean crop are found to adversely affect crop development and growth and hence the yields at selected sites. We have also examined the plausible effects of future climate change on soybean yields in the selected region based on simulations carried out for doubled atmospheric CO2 level and with modified weather variables using the available seasonal projections for the future. Our findings on the response of elevated CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere suggest higher yields (50% increase) for soybean crop for a doubling of CO2. However, a 3 degrees C rise in surface air temperature almost cancels out the positive effects of elevated CO2 on the yield. Soybean crops at selected site are more vulnerable to increases in maximum temperature than in minimum temperature. The combined effect of doubled CO2 and anticipated thermal stress (likely by middle of the next century) on soybean crop is about 36% increase in yield at the selected sites. A decline in daily rainfall amount by 10% restricts this yield gain to about 32%. Deficient rainfall with uneven distribution during the monsoon season could be a critical factor for the soybean productivity even under the positive effects of elevated CO2 in the future.

Plants growing in deep shade and high temperature, such as in the understorey of humid tropical forests, have been predicted to be particularly sensitive to rising atmospheric CO2. We tested this hypothesis in five species whose microhabitat quantum flux density (QFD) was documented as a covariable. After 7 (tree seedlings of Tachigalia versicolor and Beilschmiedia pendula) and 18 months (shrubs Piper cordulatum and Psychotria limonensis, and grass Pharus latifolius) of elevated CO2 treatment (c. 700 mu l litre(-1)) under mean QFD of less than 11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), ail species produced more biomass (25-76%) under elevated CO2. 2.

Root elongation as a function of soil temperature was determined for the CAM succulent Opuntia ficus-indica, under three different day/night air temperatures (15 degrees C/5 degrees C, 25 degrees C/15 degrees C and 35 degrees C/25 degrees C) and an ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) vs a doubled CO2 concentration (720 mu mol mol(-1)) at 25 degrees C/15 degrees C, the optimum temperature for net CO2 uptake. 2. Root elongation occurred at soil temperatures from 12 degrees C (at 15 degrees C/5 degrees C) to 43 degrees C (at 35 degrees C/25 degrees C) with optimum temperatures of 27-30 degrees C, similar to other CAM succulents and consistent with the distribution of this shallow-rooted species in warm regions. Although a doubled CO2 concentration did not alter the optimum or limiting soil temperatures, increases of up to 5 degrees C in these temperatures accompanied the 20 degrees C increase in day/night air temperatures. 3. Root elongation rates at optimum soil temperatures ranged from 5.4 mm day(-1) (15 degrees C/5 degrees C), through 6.6 mm day(-1) (25 degrees C/15 degrees C), to 10.4 mm day(-1) (35 degrees C/25 degrees C) with a 25% increase under a doubled CO2 concentration. Highest root elongation rates at 35 degrees C/25 degrees C may reflect changing root vs shoot sink strengths in a species with a highly plastic root system. 4.

Using large pasture turves, previously exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations of 350 or 700 mu mol mol(-1) for 324 d under well-watered conditions, the morphological and physiological responses of pasture species growing at these CO2 concentrations were compared when subjected to a soil moisture deficit-and to recovery from the deficit-with those that continued to be well watered. Net leaf photosynthesis of Trifolium repens (C-3 legume), Plantago lanceolata (C-3) and Paspalum dilatatum (C-4) was increased by exposure to elevated CO2, but there was no consistent effect of CO2 on stomatal conductance. At low soil moistures, net photosynthesis declined and stomatal conductance increased in these three species. There was a strong CO2 x water interaction in respect of net photosynthesis; in Trifolium repens, for example, elevated CO2 increased net photosynthesis by approximately 50% under well- watered conditions and this increased to over 300% when soil moisture levels reached their minimum values. Similar values were recorded for both Paspalum dilatatum and Plantago lanceolata. Potential water use efficiency (net photosynthesis/stomatal conductance) was increased by both exposure to elevated CO2 and drought. Leaf water status was measured in three species: Trifolium repens, Paspalum dilatatum and Holcus lanatus (C-3). Total leaf water potential (psi(t)) and osmotic potential (psi(pi)) were decreased by drought, but CO2 concentration had no consistent effect. psi(t) and psi(pi) were highest in the C-4 species Paspalum dilatatum and lowest in the legume Trifolium repens. In the wet turves, rates of leaf extension of the C-3 grasses Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne at elevated CO2 were frequently higher than those at ambient CO2, but there was no effect of CO2 concentration on the rate recorded in the C-4 grass Paspalum dilatatum or the rate of leaf appearance in the legume Trifolium repens. Drought reduced leaf extension rate irrespective of CO2 in all species, but in Holcus lanatus the reduction was less severe at elevated CO2. Immediately after the dry turves were rewatered the leaf extension rates on tillers of Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne were higher than on tillers in the wet turves, but only at ambient CO2. Consequently, despite the greater leaf extension rate during the soil moisture deficit at elevated CO2, because of the overcompensation after rewatering at ambient CO2, total leaf extension over both the drying and rewetting period did not differ between CO2 concentrations for these C-3 grass species.

Wheat, grown from seedling emergence to maturity under the different physico-chemical climates, was inoculated with leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) at tillering stage and a rust epidemic was induced by repeated re-inoculations with the newly Formed inoculum. Ozone significantly reduced disease severity, uredospore production and increased the latent period of leaf rust on young planes, consequently inhibiting the epidemic spread on upper leaves of mature plants. Inhibiting effects of ozone on leaf rust development were not reflected by the early infection stages such as spore germination, germ tube growth, formation of infection hyphae, haustorial mother cells and haustoria, which remained largely unaffected by the ozone treatments. However, ozone induced a significantly higher extent of hypersensitive responses of the infected leaf tissue. Additionally, plants exposed to elevated ozone turned senescent much earlier than plants without this stress which prematurely degraded the growth conditions for the fungal pathogen. Enrichment with CO2 increased the rotal carbohydrate content in leaves but this had only minor effects on the disease. Thus, elevated CO2 only poorly compensated for the disease-inhibiting effects of ozone. The compensation of ozone effects on wheat leaf rust by elevated CO2 is much smaller than known compensatory effects of both gases on plans productivity.2602^6^Dickson,R E^Coleman,M D^Riemenschneider,D E^Isebrands,J G^Hogan,G D^Karnosky,D F^1998^1^Growth of five hybrid poplar genotypes exposed to interacting elevated CO2 and O-3^155^28^11^1706-1716^^^^^Nov^^^^^79631076^1103^230^312^3225^344^3684^3685^3686^798^hyphae, haustorial mother cells and haustoria, which A^7962^A wide variety of hybrid poplar clones are being introduced for intensive culture biomass production, but the potential clonal or genotypic response to increasing tropospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O-3), and their interactions are unknown. To study these effects, we exposed five different hybrid Populus clones to increased concentrations of CO2, O-3, and CO2 + O-3 in open-top chambers for one growing season and determined growth responses. Exposure to elevated CO2 increased height growth, dry mass, and basal area; exposure to O-3 decreased all three of these growth responses. Exposure impact differed among the different plant parts (leaf, stem, and roots) and among the crones. These differences were associated with different growth strategies or carbon allocation patterns inherent in the different clones. The fastest growing clones had the greatest response to O-3 treatment. The addition of CO2 to the O-3 exposure counteracted the negative impact of O-3 in all plant components except leaf mass (e.g., CO2 + O-3 plant mass equaled control plant mass) in all of the clones.

To reduce some of the uncertainties in predicting the responses of this key ecosystem, the climate change experiment (CLIMEX) exposed an entire undisturbed catchment of boreal vegetation to CO2 enrichment (560 ppmv) and climate change (+ 5 degrees C in winter, + 3 degrees C in summer) for three years (1994-96). This paper describes the leaf metabolic responses of the vegetation to the experimental treatment and model simulations of possible future changes in the hydrological and carbon balance of the site. Randomized intervention analysis of the leaf gas exchange measurements for the dominant species indicated Pinus sylvestris had significantly (P < 0.01) higher photosynthetic rates and Betula pubescens and Vaccinium myrtillus had significantly (P < 0.01) lower stomatal conductances after three years treatment compared to the controls. These responses led to sustained increases in leaf water-use efficiency of all species of trees and ground shrubs, as determined from carbon isotope analyses. Photosynthesis (A) vs. intercellular CO2 (c(i)) response curves (A/c(i) responses), RuBisCo analysis and leaf nitrogen data together suggested none of the species investigated exhibited down- regulation in photosynthetic capacity. At the whole ecosystem level, the improved water economy of the plants did not translate into increased catchment runoff. Modelling simulations for the site indicate this was most likely brought about by a compensatory increase in evapotranspiration.

Amongst sites, mass remaining was strongly related to mean annual temperature and precipitation and amongst litter types the ratio of Klason lignin to nitrogen in the initial tissue was the most important litter quality variable. When combined into a multiple regression, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and Klason lignin:nitrogen ratio explained 73% of the variance in mass remaining for all sites and tissues. Using three doubled CO2 GCM climate change scenarios for four Canadian regions, these relationships were used to predict increases in decomposition rate of 4-7% of contemporary rates (based on mass remaining after 3 years), because of increased temperature and precipitation.

These diversity manipulations were done in factorial combination with a CO2 enrichment experiment in order to investigate the degree to which ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 are altered by a loss of plant diversity. Ecosystem CO2 and H2O fluxes were measured over several 24-h periods during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. Ecosystem CO2 assimilation on a ground area basis decreased with decreasing plant diversity in the first year and this was related to a decline in above-ground plant biomass. In the second year, however, CO2 assimilation was not affected by diversity, and this corresponded to the disappearance of a diversity effect on above-ground biomass. Irrespective of diversity treatment, CO2 assimilation on a ground area basis was linearly related to peak aboveground biomass in both years. Elevated CO2 significantly increased ecosystem CO2 assimilation in both years with no interaction between diversity and CO2 treatment, and no corresponding increase in above-ground biomass. There were no significant effects of diversity on water vapour nux, which was measured only in the second year. There were indications of a small CO2 effect on water vapour flux (3-9% lower at elevated CO2 depending on the light level).

Bi-weekly measurements were made to determine the dynamics and distribution of fine roots (<1 mm diameter) for Pinus radiata trees growing at ambient (350 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (650 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration in large open-top chambers. Measurements were made using minirhizotrons installed horizontally at depths of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 m. During the first year, at a depth of 0.3 m, the increase in relative growth rate of roots occurred 6 weeks earlier in the elevated CO2 treatment and the maximum rate was reached 10 weeks earlier than for trees in the ambient treatment.

In general, Yuccas exposed to elevated CO2 showed decreases in carboxylation efficiency as compared with plants grown at ambient before the initiation of high temperature, The coastal species (Y. whipplei) showed significant reductions (33%) in CO2 saturated maximum assimilation rate (A(max)), but the desert species (Y. brevifolia and Y. schidigera) showed no such reductions in A(max). Stomatal conductance was lower in elevated CO2 as compared with ambient throughout the temperature event; however, there were species-specific differences over time. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis in Y. whipplei at high temperatures for a period of 4 d, but not for Y. brevifolia or Y. schidigera, Elevated CO2 offset photoinhibition (measured as F-v/F-m) in Y. whipplei as compared with ambient CO2, depending on exposure time to high temperature. Stable F-v/F-m in Y. whipplei occurred in parallel with increases in the quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi PSII) at high temperatures in elevated CO2. The value of Phi PSII remained constant or decreased with increasing temperature in all other treatment and species combinations, This suggests that the reductions in F-v/F-m resulted from thermal energy dissipation in the pigment bed for Y. brevifolia and Y. schidigera, The greater efficiency of photosystem II in Y. whipplei helped to maintain photosynthetic function at high temperatures in elevated CO2. These patterns are in contrast to the hypothesis that high temperatures in elevated CO2 would increase the potential for photoinhibition, Our results suggest that elevated CO2 may offset high-temperature stress in coastal Yucca, but not in those species native to drier systems, Therefore, in the case of Y. whipplei, elevated CO2 may allow plants to survive extreme temperature events, potentially relaxing the effects of high temperature on the establishment in novel habitats.2609^4^Leadley,P W^Niklaus,P A^Stocker,R^Korner,C^1999^1^A field study of the effects of elevated CO2 on plant biomass and community structure in a calcareous grassland^2^118^1^39-49^^^^^Jan^^^^^7977g temperature in a1600^3047^344^376^385^427^672^740^803^92^s, This suggests that the reductions in F-v/F-m resulted from thermal energy dissipation in the pigment bed for Y. brevifolia and Y. schidigera, The greater efficiency of photosystem II in Y. whipplei helped to maintain photosynthetic function at high temperatures in elevated CO2.

This highly diverse, semi- natural plant community is dominated by the perennial grass Bromus erectus and is mown twice a year to maintain species composition. Plots of 1.3 m(2) were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations (n = 8) using a novel CO2 exposure technique, screen-aided CO2 control (SACC) starting in March 1994. In the 1st year of treatment, the annual harvested biomass (sum of aboveground biomass from mowings in June and October) was not significantly affected by elevated CO2. However, biomass increased significantly at elevated CO2 in the 2nd (+20%, P = 0.05), 3rd (+21%, P = 0.02) and 4th years (+29%, P = 0.02). There were no detectable differences in root biomass in the top 8 cm of soil between CO2 treatments on eight out of nine sampling dates. There were significant differences in CO2 responsiveness between functional groups (legumes, non- leguminous forbs, graminoids) in the 2nd (P = 0.07) and 3rd (P < 0.001) years of the study. The order of CO2 responsiveness among functional groups changed substantially from the 2nd to the 3rd year; for example, non-leguminous forbs had the smallest relative response in the 2nd year and the largest in the 3rd year. By the 3rd year of CO2 exposure, large species- specific differences in CO2 response had developed. For five important species or genera the order of responsiveness was Lotus corniculatus (+271%), Carex flacca (+249%), Bromus erectus (+ 33%), Sanguisorba minor (no significant CO2 effect), and six Trifolium species (a negative response that was not significant). The positive CO2 responses in Bromus and Carex were most closely related to increases in tiller number. Species richness was not affected by CO2 treatment, but species evenness increased under elevated CO2 (modified Hill ratio; P = 0.03) in June of the 3rd year, resulting in a marginally significant increase in species diversity (Simpson's index; P = 0.09). This and other experiments with calcareous grassland plants show that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can substantially alter the structure of calcareous grassland communities and may increase plant community biomass.2610^2^Deepak,S S^Agrawal,M^1999^1^Growth and yield responses of wheat plants to elevated levels of CO2 and SO2, singly and in combination^35^104^3^411-419^^^^^^^^^^7979130^243^256^310^312^348^446^461^466^724^e order of responsiveness was Lotus corniculatus (+271%), Carex flacca (+249%), Bromus erectus (+ 33%), Sanguisorba minor (no significant CO2 effect), and six Trifolium species (a negative response that was not significant).

Exposure of plants to 0.06 ppm SO2 significantly reduced plant height, leaf area, biomass and yield. Elevated CO2, on the other hand, stimulated the growth and yield of plants. Combination of CO2 and SO2 showed a similar response pattern as that of CO2 alone. Pattern of biomass allocation also varied in response to different treatments. RGR was significantly increased due to CO2 and CO2 + SO2 treatments, whereas the same reduced due to SO2 exposure. Root/shoot ratio decreased significantly due to CO2 and CO2 + SO2 treatment at 45 days age. CO2 modified the responses of plants to SO2. Combined exposure of SO2 and CO2 stimulated the growth as well as the yield maximally. This suggests that the CO2 enrichment has not only reduced the adverse effect of low level of SO2, but at the same time the extra carbon provided by CO2 enrichment took the advantage of air borne sulphur as nutrient and showed maximum increment in growth and yield.

The biomass of both control and salinity-stressed plants grown at high temperatures (daily maximum of 37 degrees C) and an irradiance of 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was increased by up to 200% by enriched rhizosphere DIG. The growth rates of plants grown with irradiances of less than 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were increased by elevated rhizosphere DIC concentrations only when grown at high shoot temperatures (35 degrees C) or with salinity (28 degrees C), At high light intensities, the photosynthetic rate, the CO2 and light-saturated photosynthetic rate (J(max)) and the stomatal conductance of plants grown at high light intensity were lower in plants supplied with enriched compared to ambient DIG. This was interpreted as 'down-regulation' of the photosynthetic system in plants supplied with elevated DIG.

Stomatal conductances of abaxial and adaxial epidermes measured under optimal conditions were not significantly affected by growth under E, but the stomatal regulation of gas exchange was better. Leaf photosynthetic rate (A) of elevated CO2 plants was similar to that of control plants when both were measured under normal CO2, but higher when both were measured under elevated CO2. The A of elevated CO2 plants was much higher than the A of control plants when measured under their respective growth CO2 concentration, which resulted in their higher growth rate. Chlorophyll a and b contents, and activities of whole electron transport chain and of photosystem (PS) II were not markedly affected by growth under E, and the maximum efficiency of PSII measured as the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence was even slightly increased. Hence no down-regulation of photosynthesis occurred in transplanted plants grown for 4 weeks under E. The contents of p-carotene and of xanthophyll cycle pigments (violaxanthin + antheraxanthin+zeaxanthin) were lower in E plants. The degree of de-epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments was not changed or was even lower after transfer to ex vitro conditions, which indicated that no photoinhibition occurred, Therefore, CO2 enrichment can improve acclimation of in vitro-grown plantlets to ex vitro conditions.2613^3^Idso,C D^Idso,S B^Balling,R C^1998^1^The urban CO2 dome of Phoenix, Arizona^395^19^2^95-108^^^^^Mar-Apr^^^^^79851262^3696^3697^3698^372^377^434^444^461^508^rowth CO2 concentration, which resulted in their higher growth rate.

Spatially interpolated maps of the data indicate the presence of an "urban CO2 dome" that reaches concentrations as high as 555 ppmv in the city center and decreases to a value of approximately 370 ppmv on the outskirts of the city at this time of year. Pre-dawn CO2 values inside the dome are considerably higher than mid-afternoon values, suggesting that solar-induced convective mixing and the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by urban vegetation may play significant roles in diurnally redistributing the anthropogenically produced CO2 that, together with that produced by plant respiration, accumulates near the ground during the night and early morning hours. Temperature and relative humidity appear to have little influence on either the concentration or location of the CO2 dome, but variations in wind speed and direction at times may disrupt the pattern that develops under normally fair conditions. The high CO2 concentrations within the dome may help to ameliorate the deleterious effects of urban air pollution on vegetation growing within the city. Together with the urban heat island phenomenon, they may also provide a natural laboratory for studying the effects of contemporaneous warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment within the context of predicted future global change.2614^4^Jiang,W B^Lers,A^Lomaniec,E^Aharoni,N^1999^1^Senescence-related serine protease in parsley^129^50^3^377-382^^^^^Feb^^^^^79871085^3699^417^ptake of CO2 by urban vegetation may play significant roles in diurnally redistributing the anthropogenically produced CO2 that, together with that produced by plant respiration, accumulates near the ground during the night and early morning hours.

In order to obtain information on the enzymes involved in this process, a study was initiated to identify and characterize proteases whose activity is elevated in artificially senescing parsley leaves.

This protease activity, which is low in young leaves, was found to increase considerably in parallel to the advance of senescence and the reduction in the protein content of the leaves. A high correlation between the progress of senescence and the increase in the activity of the 70 kDa serine protease was demonstrated. Treatments with CO2 or gibberellic acid, which retard senescence, reduced the protease's activity, whereas acceleration of senescence with ethylene enhanced it. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using compartments accessible only to AMF hyphae but not to roots, we also tested whether elevated CO2 affects the growth of external AMF hyphae. Plant biomass was significantly greater at elevated than at ambient CO2; the biomass of the root system, for example, increased by a factor of 2. The colonization of AMF inside the root remained constant, indicating that the total AMF inside the root system also increased by a factor of 2. The length of external AMF hyphae at elevated CO2 was up to 5 times that at ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2 promoted allocation of AMF biomass to the external hyphae. The concentration and content of phosphorus in the stolons differed significantly between ambient and elevated CO2 but this resulted in either an increase or a decrease, according to which AMF isolate occupied the roots. We hypothesized that an increase in external hyphal growth at elevated CO2 would result in increased P acquistion by the plant. To test this we supplied phosphorus, in a compartment only accessible to AMF hyphae. Plants did not acquire more phosphorus at elevated CO2 when phosphorus was added to this compartment. Large increases in AMF hyphal growth could, however? play a significant role in the movement of fixed carbon to the soil and increase soil aggregation.2618^4^Pleijel,H^Sild,J^Danielsson,H^Klemedtsson,L^1998^1^Nitrous oxide emissions from a wheat field in response to elevated carbon dioxide concentration and open-top chamber enclosure^35^102^^167-171^^^^^^^^^^79951484^179^434^ at ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2 promoted allocation of AMF biomass to the external hyphae.

Measurements of N2O emissions were made weekly starting at anthesis. The measurements continued for ten weeks, until two weeks after the harvest of the mature crop. During the first eight weeks the N2O emissions were higher in the OTC350 treatment compared to OTC700. At the last two measurements, after the plants were harvested, the N2O emissions of the chamber treatments were similar to each other and higher than during the preceding period. The accumulation of grain protein per unit area was higher in OTC700 compared with OTC350. These results suggest that a competition for soil nitrogen exists between plants and the microbial community. The AA plots emitted less N2O during the green canopy period compared with the chamber treatments. After harvest, the emissions from AA increased up to the same magnitude as the chamber treatments. The lower emissions of the ambient air plots during the pre- harvest period can be explained partly by lower ambient temperatures and drier soil.2619^1^Navas,M L^1998^1^Individual species performance and response of multispecific communities to elevated CO2: a review^43^12^5^721-727^^^^^Oct1345^1388^2348^312^344^506^512^540^679^701^2620^4^Buse,A^Good,J E G^Dury,S^Perrins,C M^1998^1^Effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide on the nutritional quality of leaves of oak (Quercus robur L.) as food for the Winter Moth (Operophtera brumata L.)^43^12^5^742-749^^^^^Oct^^^^^79981262^1282^1284^1752^2533^344^3700^3701^57^92^ation of grain protein per unit area was higher in OTC700 compared with OTC350.

Within this field, simulating an individual plant's physiological responses to global change, especially the combined effects of CO2 enrichment and the climatic change it caused, is a useful model in predicting the changes of either natural vegetation or agricultural crops, in that the physiological basis of the responses are mostly understood and the results of simulation can be checked with experiments at any level or step when needed. Since the scenarios of the global changes often differ with different GCM's, and will change as the GCM's are being improved, even though, the simulation programs can still be used to for new predictions. In this study, based on the physiological mechanisms, a systematic dynamic model of plant individual growth was established, which included a weather generator and a growth module. The combined effects of enriched CO2 and climatic change on the main physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, etc., and seasonal dynamics of biomass were considered in the model. The data sets of the long-term weather records of Beijing Meteorological Station and the observed values of many ecophysiological quantities, obtained in a CO2 enrichment experiment of soybean, were used to parameterize and to validate the model. The results showed that data obtained from the simulation were quite compatible with those from the observation. When the CO2 concentration was doubled, the peak values of the total biomass and green biomass were increased approximately by 70% and 56% respectively. Furthermore, the responses of the total net assimilation and the average specific dark respiration rate within the growth season explained the internal mechanism of the biomass responses. The result indicated that the total net assimilation increased, while the average specific dark respiration rate decreased. Thus, it can be deduced that the increase of biomass nas brought about not only by the increase of the net assimilation, but also by the decrease of the specific dark respiration rate. Sensitivity analysis was used to the soybean individual responses to global change. The seasonal dynamics of the total biomass to the combined effects of different levels of CO2, temperature and precipitation were simulated. CO2 concentration and precipitation have positive, while temperature has negative effect on total biomass. The positive effect of precipitation became weaker with increasing temperatures, while the negative effect of temperature was strengthened by the increased precipitation. The positive effect of CO2 concentration became stronger with the increasing temperatures, but weaker under enhancing precipitations. The positive effect of precipitation and the negative effect of temperature were weakened by doubling the CO2 concentration. These are partly due to the enhanced water use efficiency caused by CO2 enrichment, which in turn renders the plant individual more resistant and adaptable to the environmental change.2622^3^Ziska,L H^Bunce,J A^Caulfield,F^1998^1^Intraspecific variation in seed yield of soybean (Glycine max) in response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide^92^25^7^801-807^^^^^^^^^^8002130^2654^3298^349^92^ined effects of different levels of CO2, temperature and precipitation were simulated.

At elevated CO2, total biomass increased an average of 42% at the end of the vegetative stage, while average seed yield increased by only 28%. No changes in % protein or % oil were observed for any cultivar at elevated CO2, relative to ambient CO2. The relative enhancement of either vegetative or reproductive growth at elevated CO2 was not correlated with changes in the absolute or relative increase in single leaf photosynthetic rate among cultivars at elevated CO2.

We experimentally manipulated a small forested catchment in southern Norway by increasing soil temperature (+3 degrees C in summer to +5 degrees C in winter) using heating cables installed at 1 cm depth in the litter layer. Especially nitrification in the 0 to 10-cm soil layer increased as a result of the climate manipulation. Betula litter, produced after exposing trees for 2 years to ambient and elevated CO2 in greenhouses, was incubated for 1 year in the manipulated catchment.

Four experimental plots (10 x 10 m) had heating cables installed within the forest floor. Temperatures at 5 cm were increased 2.5, 5.0, or 7.5 degrees C in individual heated plots during the field season in 1993 and 1994. The fourth plot was a cabled, nonheated reference. Trace gas fluxes were monitored using closed chambers. Soil moisture was monitored using tensiometers and time domain reflectometry. Changes in leaf litter decomposition were quantified using litter bags for American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter. Fluxes of CO2 increased exponentially with increased soil temperatures within treatments and were higher in heated plots than in the reference plot. Temperature coefficients (Q(10)) and mass remaining of American beech leaf litter decreased with the level of heating, suggesting a nonlinear microbial response to elevated temperatures. Soil water content exhibited the most influence on CH4 and N2O flux in the second season. The experimental manipulations showed the importance of evaluating the influence of soil temperature coupled with effects of N and moisture availability.2625^1^Heath,J^1998^1^Stomata of trees growing in CO2-enriched air show reduced sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit and drought^9^21^11^1077-1088^^^^^Nov^^^^^80081935^2128^2489^3123^344^3703^3704^374^383^398^ was monitored using tensiometers and time domain reflectometry.

In oak, g(s) was consistently reduced in elevated CO2, However, in beech and chestnut, the stomata of trees growing in elevated CO2 failed to close normally in response to increased leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (LAVPD). Consequently, while g(s) was reduced in elevated CO2 on days with low LAVPD, on warm sunny days (with correspondingly high LAVPD) g(s) was unchanged or even slightly higher in elevated CO2. Furthermore, during drought, g(s) of beech and chestnut was unresponsive to [CO2], over a wide range of ambient LAVPD, whereas in oak g(s) was reduced by an average of 50% in elevated CO2.

P. laxum (C-3) was used for comparison, The young C, leaves had COL and light response curves typical of C-4 photosynthesis. When the O-2 concentration was gradually increased between 2 and 40%, CO2 assimilation rates (A) of both mature and young C-4 leaves were little affected, while the ratio of the quantum yield of photosystem II to that of CO2 assimilation (Phi(PSII)/Phi(CO2)) increased more in young (up to 31%) than mature (up to 10%) C-4 leaves.

Larger increases in electron transport requirements in young, relative to mature, C-4 leaves at low CO2 are indicative of greater O-2 sensitivity of photorespiration, Photosynthesis modelling showed that young C-4 leaves have lower bundle sheath CO2 concentration, brought about by higher bundle sheath conductance relative to the activity of the C-4 and C-3 cycles and/or lower ratio of activities of the C-4 to C-3 cycles.2627^2^Lutze,J L^Gifford,R M^1998^1^Acquisition and allocation of carbon and nitrogen by Danthonia richardsonii in response to restricted nitrogen supply and CO2 enrichment^9^21^11^1133-1141^^^^^Nov^^^^^8012362^372^417^425^437^512^545^685^750^977^h mature and young C-4 leaves were little affected, while the ratio of the quantum yield of photosystem II to that of CO2 assimilation (Phi(PSII)/Phi(CO2)) increased more in young (up to 31%) than mature (up to 10%) C-4 leaves.

To determine the relative importance of leaf versus whole plant level limitations on carbohydrate utilization at elevated CO2, and the possible effects on the regulation of photosynthetic capacity, we constructed a treatment system in which we could expose single, attached, soybean leaflets to CO2 concentrations different from those experienced by the rest of the plant. The single leaflet treatments had dramatic effects on the carbohydrate contents of the treated leaflets. However, photosynthetic capacity and rubisco content were unaffected by the individual leaflet treatment and instead were related to the whole plant CO2 environment, despite the fact that the CO2 environment around the rest of the plant had no significant affect on the total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) contents of the treated leaflets. These results necessitate a re- evaluation of the response mechanisms to CO2 as well as some of the methods used to test these responses. We propose mechanisms by which sink strength could influence leaf physiology independently of changes in carbohydrate accumulation.2629^1^Yeo,A^1999^1^Predicting the interaction between the effects of salinity and climate change on crop plants^165^78^1-4^159-174^^^^^1 Jan^^^^^80161163^174^314^360^3708^374^377^384^409^92^, attached, soybean leaflets to CO2 concentrations different from those experienced by the rest of the plant.

This will increase the demand for irrigation because irrigation gives a higher potential yield per unit area than non-irrigated agriculture, together with more yield stability. The demand for irrigation will be especially focused in semi-arid regions supporting a large population, such as the Mediterranean basin and the Indo- Gangetic plain of northern India and Pakistan. The 'hot/warm semi-arid' agro-climatic zone is the one projected most to expand in relative proportion as a consequence of climate change brought about by the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Irrigation in semi-arid climates is a major cause of secondary salinisation (that due to human activity) which already affects 1 ha in five of the irrigated lands. Increased demand for irrigation in semi-arid climates, as a result of both population increase and climate change, will tend to increase the extent of secondary salinisation. Any increase in the extent of secondary salinisation could be offset by positive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on crop yield per unit area and per unit input of water. In protected environments, or where CO2 is the only experimental variable, elevated CO2 usually enhances plant growth and water-use- efficiency in the short-term and can also do so in the longer term. However, far crop production in the field world-wide, elevated CO2 per se is not a factor that can be viewed separately from the climate change that it will bring about. Neither the anticipated 'CO2-fertilisation' nor the 'water-use- efficiency' benefits to the plant of elevated CO2 is certain to outweigh the climatic effects of elevated CO2 on temperature, water availability and evaporative demand. Climate change is expected to cause a net increase in the proportion of land classed as semi-arid. Raised temperatures may benefit some crops in some places but disadvantage others through increased evapotranspiration and thermal damage. Increased water-use- efficiency may not reduce leaf salt concentration in a saline environment. Buffering and feedback effects in both agricultural and ecological systems conspire to moderate or even to confound the anticipated gains in net assimilation and water-use-efficiency found in experimental systems. Elevated CO2 may not, therefore, provide the anticipated decrease in water-use, decrease in leaf salt concentration, and increase in fixed carbon available for re-allocation: factors that might enhance crop performance under salinity stress. If these benefits are not realised then elevated atmospheric CO2 will exacerbate rather than moderate the problems of secondary salinity in agriculture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The annual total of net leaf photosynthesis was 110% more in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2. However, the trees in elevated COP grew only 59% more biomass than the trees in ambient COP over the year. Modelling studies showed that larger loss of carbon from fine-root production and growth of the root-associated mycorrhiza by the trees in elevated CO2 probably accounted for all the remaining difference in net photosynthesis between the two treatments. Our modelling also showed that the fraction of net photosynthate consumed by respiration of nonleaf tissue was similar in the two CO2 treatments, and was 26% and 24% for trees in ambient and elevated CO2, respectively.

The effect of CO2 enrichment on total system carbon content did not diminish with time. Increased carbon accumulation occurred despite the development over time of a lower leaf area index and less carbon in the green leaf fraction at high CO2. The extra carbon accumulated at high CO2 in the soil, senesced leaf and leaf litter fractions at all N levels, and in root at high-N, while at low-and mid-N less carbon accumulated in the root fraction at high CO2. The rate of leaf turnover was increased under CO2 enrichment, as indicated by increases in the carbon mass ratio of senesced to green leaf lamina. Microcosm evapotranspiration rates were lower at high CO2 when water was in abundant supply, resulting in higher average soil water contents. The higher soil water contents at high CO2 have important implications for microcosm function, and may have contributed significantly to the increased carbon accumulation at high CO2.

Source-sink interactions, particularly with regard to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), are key determinants of PS acclimation to elevated [CO2] at the whole-plant level. In the long term, PS and growth response to [CO2] are dependent on genotypic and environmental factors affecting the plant's ability to develop new sinks for C, and acquire adequate N and other resources to support an enhanced growth potential. Growth at elevated [CO2] usually increases N use efficiency because PS rates can be maintained at levels comparable to those observed at ambient [CO2] with less N investment in PS enzymes. A frequent acclimation response, particularly under N-limited conditions, is for the accumulation of leaf carbohydrates at elevated [CO2] to lead to repression of genes associated with the production of PS enzymes. The hypothesis that this is an adaptive response, leading to a diversion of N to plant organs where it is of greatest benefit in terms of competitive ability and reproductive fitness, needs to be more rigorously tested. The biological control mechanisms which plants have evolved to acclimate to shifts in source-sink balance caused by elevated [CO2] are complex, and will only be fully elucidated by probing at all scales along the hierarchy from molecular to ecosystem.

C), elevated temperature (Elev. T) and a combination of elevated CO2 and temperature (Elev. C + T). Using the constant- power heat balance method, sap flow was monitored simultaneously in a total of 16 trees, four for each treatment, over a 32 d period (after the completion of needle expansion and branch elongation in 1997). An overall variation in diurnal sap flow totals (F-t) was evident during the period of measurement (days 167-198, 1997) regardless of the treatments, with a range from 0.15 to 2.82 kg tree(-1) d(-1). Elev. C reduced F-t by 4.1-13.7% compared with CON on most days (P varies from 0.042 to 0.108), but slightly increased it on some days (P greater than or equal to 0.131), depending on the weather conditions. Although the decrease in F-t caused by Elev. C was statistically significant on only a few days (P < 0.042), the cumulative F-t, for the 32 d decreased by 14.4% (P = 0.047), indicating that Elev. C may have an important influence on seasonal water use of the Scots pine. Analysis of the diurnal courses of sap flow combined with corresponding weather factors indicated that the CO2-induced decrease in F-t could be largely attributed to an increase in stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit (VPD), whereas the CO2- induced increase in F-t related to an increase in stomatal sensitivity to low light levels. Elev. T increased F-t by 11.2- 35.6% throughout the measuring period and the cumulative F-t for the 32 d by 32.5% (P = 0.019), which could be largely attributed to the temperature-induced increase in current-year needle area and decrease in stomatal sensitivity to high levels of VPD. There were no significant interactive effects of CO2 and temperature on sap flow, so that Elev. C + T had approximately the same F-t as Elev.

Don. trees growing for 4 years in large, open- top chambers at ambient (36 Pa) and elevated (65 Pa) CO2 partial pressures. At this age trees were 3.5-4 m tall. Measurements made late in the growing cycle (March) showed that photosynthetic rates at the growth CO2 concentration [(pCO(2))(a)] were lower in 1-year-old needles of trees grown at elevated CO2 concentrations than in those of trees grown at ambient (pCO(2))(a). At elevated CO2 concentrations V-cmax (maximum carboxylation rate) was reduced by 13% and J(max) (RuBP regeneration capacity mediated by maximum electron transport rate) by 17%. This corresponded with photosynthetic rates at the growth (pCO(2))(a) of 4.68 +/- 0.41 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 6.15 +/- 0.46 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 36 and 65 Pa, respectively (an enhancement of 31%). In current year needles photosynthetic rates at the growth (pCO(2))(a) were 6.2 +/- 0.72 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 36 Pa and 10.15 +/- 0.64 mu mol m(- 2) s(-1) at 65 Pa (an enhancement of 63%). The smaller enhancement of photosynthesis in 1-year-old needles at 65 Pa was accompanied by a reduction in Rubisco activity (39%) and content (40%) compared with that at 36 Pa. Starch and sugar concentrations in 1-year-old needles were not significantly different in the CO2 treatments. There was no evidence in biochemical parameters for down-regulation at elevated (pCO(2))(a) in fully fexpanded needles of the current year cohort. These data show that enhancement of photosynthesis continues to occur in needles after 4 years' exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations. Photosynthetic acclimation reduces the degree of this enhancement, but only in needles after 1 year of growth. Thus, responses to elevated CO2 concentration change during the lifetime of needles, and acclimation may not be apparent in current year needles. This transitory effect is most probably attributable to the effects of developmental stage and proximity to actively growing shoots on sink strength for carbohydrates. The implications of such age-dependent responses are that older trees, in which the contribution of older needles to the photosynthetic biomass is greater than in younger trees, may become progressively more acclimated to elevated CO2 concentration.2637^4^Paoletti,E^Nourrisson,G^Garrec,J P^Raschi,A^1998^1^Modifications of the leaf surface structures of Quercus ilex L in open, naturally CO2-enriched environments^9^21^10^1071-1075^^^^^Oct^^^^^80321064^1788^2173^312^348^3710^372^374^745^890^photosynthesis continues to occur in needles after 4 years' exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations.

However, there is an incomplete understanding of the extent to which various processes contribute to total soil respiration, especially the contributions of root and rhizosphere respiration. Here, using a stable carbon isotope tracer, we separate thf relative contributions of root and soil heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration in situ. The Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility in the Duke University Forest (NC) fumigates plots of an undisturbed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest with CO2 that is strongly depleted in C-13. This labeled CO2 is found in the soil pore space through live root and mycorrhizal respiration and soil heterotroph respiration of labile root exudates. By measuring the depletion of (CO2)-C-13 in the soil system, we found that the rhizosphere contribution to soil CO2 reflected the distribution of fine roots in the soil and that late in the growing season roots contributed 55% of total soil respiration at the surface, This estimate may represent an upper limit on the contribution of roots to soil respiration because high atmospheric CO2 often increases in root density and/or root activity in the soil.2641^7^Pasquier-Cardin,A^Allard,P^Ferreira,T^Hatte,C^Coutinho,R^Fontugne,M^Jaudon,M^1999^1^Magma-derived CO2 emissions recorded in C-14 and C-13 content of plants growing in Furnas caldera, Azores^396^92^1-2^195-207^^^^^Sep^^^^^8040344^3711^3712^3713^427^lity in the Duke University Forest (NC) fumigates plots of an undisturbed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest with CO2 that is strongly depleted in C-13.

The results demonstrate a significant to large C-14 depletion in many of the plants due to assimilation of C-14-free endogenous CO2 during photosynthesis and leading to artificial radiocarbon ageing of up to 4400 years. The extent of C-14 ageing broadly correlates with the intensity of gas manifestations at the sampling sites, as inferred from field observations and measurements of excess CO2 concentrations in the volcanic ground. It also provides a time-integrated measure of the amount of volcanic CO2 locally admired to the ambient air; at several sites this accounts for 15 to 40% of total CO2 (420 to 600 ppm) in enriched air, In some of the plant species (Azalea, Camellia and fern) C-14 depletion is correlated with an enrichment of C-13 due to assimilation of magma-derived CO2 with a 4 parts per thousand higher delta(13)C than normal atmosphere. The rate of C-13 enrichment averages ca. 0.18 parts per thousand by percent of volcanic carbon fixed in the plant and includes enhanced C-13 discrimination during photosynthesis as a consequence of increased ambient pCO(2) (inferred at - 0.0306 parts per thousand per added ppm of volcanic CO2).

Even at present, the shortage of food protein resources is an acute problem. Effective countermeasures to cope with the ever worsening shortage of protein resources in the nest century are absolutely essential. We have developed methods to produce and isolate single cell proteins in an ample yield. We have also found that among food grains rice has the highest protein content, and have found that the protein in the grain is present in discrete particles, for which we coined the name ''protein bodies". Rice protein has a relatively good balance of essential amino acids, and hence a relatively high nutritional value. We were able to increase the nutritional value further by fortifying it with L-lysine by a novel soaking method. New methods of food preservation will be important to cope with the 21st century food problems, because a large amount of food is lost either on the farm or during storage, to microorganisms, rodents and insects. We developed the carbon dioxide exchange method (CEM), in in which food is stored under CO2 in helmetically sealed containers (called Hibernation Rice), CO2 is reversiblyv adsorbed to, and desorbed from the amino groups of food pl proteins. We also developed underwater and underground food storage methods earlier (1967-72), to take advantage of constant low temperatures in these conditions. Based on these studies, large scale storage methods in 200 kg steel drums in CO2 have been developed on an industrial scale which is operated on a commercial base. Metylbromide destroys the ozone layer, and will be banned completely from use for food presentation or any ether purposes. Storage under CO2 is far superior to methylbromide because CO2 completely eliminates the rice weevil and other insects, has no toxicity or public health problems, and is economical. CO2 is a very effective synergist when used with the pasteurization gas, ozone, to sterilize foods against the virulent pathogenic strain of E.coli, O-157 and black pepper which are known to be contaminated with bacteria. The use of CO2 may add to an already high production of CO2 from other sources, such as combustion of fossil fuels. Effective measures to prevent leakage of CO2 are needed. We are striving for an innovative idea to pre-vent the escape of CO2 and the consequential warming of the earth.2643^3^Ahmadi,H^Biasi,W V^Mitcham,E J^1999^1^Control of brown rot decay of nectarines with 15% carbon dioxide atmospheres^154^124^6^708-712^^^^^Nov^^^^^80441460^1507^3714^3715^3716^3717^3718^ommercial base.

Increasing [CO2] stimulated photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration regardless of N treatment. The increase in photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration was associated with a moderate reduction in stomatal conductance, resulting in enhanced instantaneous transpiration efficiency in leaves of seedlings in CO2-enriched air. Elevated [CO2] increased biomass production only in the high-N treatment. Fine root/foliage mass ratio decreased with high-N treatment and increased with CO2 enrichment. There was evidence of a preferential shift of biomass to below-ground tissue at a low level of nutrient addition. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased significantly in leaves of seedlings grown in elevated [CO2] irrespective of N treatment. Leaf N concentration decreased significantly in elevated [CO2] irrespective of N treatment. As a result of patterns of N and carbon concentrations, C/N ratio generally increased with elevated [CO2] treatment and decreased with high nutrient supply. Afternoon starch concentrations in leaves did not increase significantly with increasing [CO2], as was the case for morning starch concentrations at low-N supply. Starch concentrations in leaves, stem and roots increased with elevated [CO2] and decreased with nutrient addition.

Codon 335 was altered to encode valine instead of leucine. The resulting mutant plants could not grow without atmospheric CO2 enrichment. In 0.3% (v/v) CO2, the mutant and wildtype plants produced similar amounts of Rubisco but the extent of carbamylation was nearly twice as great in the mutants. The mutant enzyme's substrate-saturated CO2-fixing rate and its ability to distinguish between CO2 and O-2 as substrates were both reduced to 25% of the wild type's values. Estimates of these parameters obtained from kinetic assays with the purified mutant enzyme were the same as those inferred from measurements of photosynthetic gas exchange with leaves of mutant plants. The Michaelis constants for CO2, O-2, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate were reduced and the mutation enhanced oxygenase activity at limiting O-2 concentrations.

Understanding how increasing carbon input will influence plant developmental processes, and resultant form, will help bridge the gap between physiological response and ecosystem level phenomena. Growth in elevated CO2 alters plant structure through its effects on both primary and secondary meristems of shoots and roots. Although not well established, a review of the literature suggests that cell division, cell expansion, and cell patterning may be affected, driven mainly by increased substrate (sucrose) availability and perhaps also by differential expression of genes involved in cell cycling (e.g. cyclins) or cell expansion (e.g. xyloglucan endotransglycosylase). Few studies, however, have attempted to elucidate the mechanistic basis for increased growth at the cellular level. Regardless of specific mechanisms involved, plant leaf size and anatomy are often altered by growth in elevated CO2, but the magnitude of these changes, which often decreases as leaves mature, hinges upon plant genetic plasticity, nutrient availability, temperature, and phenology. Increased leaf growth results more often from increased cell expansion rather than increased division. Leaves of crop species exhibit greater increases in leaf thickness than do leaves of wild species. Increased mesophyll and vascular tissue cross-sectional areas, important determinates of photosynthetic rates and assimilate transport capacity, are often reported. Few studies, however, have quantified characteristics more reflective of leaf function such as spatial relationships among chlorenchyma cells (size, orientation, and surface area), intercellular spaces, and conductive tissue. Greater leaf size and/or more leaves per plant are often noted; plants grown in elevated CO2 exhibited increased leaf area per plant in 66% of studies, compared to 28% of observations reporting no change, and 6% reported a decrease in whole plant leaf area. This resulted in an average net increase in leaf area per plant of 24%. Crop species showed the greatest average increase in whole plant leaf area (+37%) compared to tree species (+14%) and wild, nonwoody species (+15%). Conversely, tree species and wild, nontrees showed the greatest reduction in specific leaf area (-14% and -20%) compared to crop plants (-6%). Alterations in developmental processes at the shoot apex and within the vascular cambium contributed to increased plant height, altered branching characteristics, and increased stem diameters. The ratio of internode length to node number often increased, but the length and sometimes the number of branches per node was greater, suggesting reduced apical dominance. Data concerning effects of elevated CO2 on stem/branch anatomy, vital for understanding potential shifts in functional relationships of leaves with stems, roots with stems, and leaves with roots, are too few to make generalizations. Growth in elevated CO2 typically leads to increased root length, diameter, and altered branching patterns. Altered branching characteristics in both shoots and roots may impart competitive relationships above and below the ground. Understanding how increased carbon assimilation affects growth processes (cell division, cell expansion, and cell patterning) will facilitate a better understanding of how plant form will change as atmospheric CO2 increases. Knowing how basic growth processes respond to increased carbon inputs may also provide a mechanistic basis for the differential phenotypic plasticity exhibited by different plant species/functional types to elevated CO2.2650^3^Islam,K R^Mulchi,C L^Ali,A A^1999^1^Tropospheric carbon dioxide or ozone enrichments and moisture effects on soil organic carbon quality^204^28^5^1629-1636^^^^^Sep-Oct^^^^^80581044^1099^1828^2087^32^3728^3729^416^423^56^l relationships of leaves with stems, roots with stems, and leaves with roots, are too few A^8057^Carbon, as an active component of organic matter, has considerable effects on soil quality and productivity.

While the relative diversity and importance of geophytes of all of the other four mediterranean regions of the world drops off sharply as one moves into adjacent winter- rainfall desert regions, geophytes in the semi-arid to arid Succulent Karoo (including Namaqualand) remain a very important component of the flora, both in terms of abundance and diversity (comprising 13 to 29% of the regional floras in this region). Apart from species richness, there are also a number of interesting geophyte growth forms in this region. One unusual growth form is geophytes with flattened leaves that lie prostrate on the soil surface. At least eight families (Amaryllidaceae, Colchicaceae, Eriospermaceae, Geraniaceae, Hyacinthaceae, Iridaceae, Orchidaceae and Oxalidaceae) exhibit this growth form. While this growth form is relatively common in many geophyte lineages in the Succulent Karoo biome and the Cape mediterranean zone (Fynbos biome), and occurs infrequently through the summer-rainfall temperate regions of Africa, it is virtually absent in other regions worldwide. A null hypothesis is that the prostrate leaved trait is a neutral characteristic, however biogeographical data do not support this. A neutral trait would be unlikely to show such a clear pattern of distribution. Several alternative hypotheses on the adaptive significance of this growth form are discussed. These include: avoidance of herbivory, reduction in competition from neighbors, creation of a CO2 enriched environment below the leaves, reduction of water loss around the roots, reduction of water loss through transpiration, precipitation of dew on the leaves and maintenance of optimal leaf temperatures for growth.2653^4^Miller,J B^Yakir,D^White,J W C^Tans,P P^1999^1^Measurement of O-18/O-16 in the soil-atmosphere CO2 flux^137^13^3^761-774^^^^^Sep^^^^^8064elat1079^1257^1535^1853^312^3732^3733^529^655^673^ucculent Karoo biome and the Cape mediterranean zone (Fynbos biome), and occurs infrequently through the summer-rainfall temperate regions of Africa, it is virtually absent in other regions worldwide.

However, this requires knowledge of the O-18 signatures attributable to the fluxes from soil and leaves. Newly developed methods were employed to measure the O-18 of soil-respired CO2 and depth profiles of near-surface soil CO2 in order to evaluate the factors influencing isotopic soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange. The O-18 soil-respired CO2 varied predominantly as a function of the O-18 of soil water which, in turn, changed with soil drying and with seasonal variations in source water. The O-18 of soil- respired CO2 corresponds to full isotopic equilibrium with soil water at a depth ranging between 5 and 15 cm. The O-18 of respired CO2, in reality, results from a weighted average of partial equilibria over a range of depths. Soil water isotopic enrichment of up to 10 parts per thousand in the top 5 cm did not appear to strongly influence the isotopic composition of the respired CO2. We demonstrate that during measurements "invasion" of atmospheric CO2 (the diffusion of ambient CO2 into the soil, followed by partial equilibration and retrodiffusion) must be considered to accurately calculate the O-18 of the soil-respired CO2. The impact of invasion in natural settings is also considered. We also have determined the effective kinetic fractionation of CO2 diffusion out of the soil to be 7.2 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand. High-resolution (1 cm) depth profiles of O-18 of near-surface (top 10 cm) soil CO2 were carried out by gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).

We observed that CO2 enrichment from 350 to 10000 ppm stimulated root colonization by the fungus, and that this stimulation was more pronounced under high PPF (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than low PPF (60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Consistent with these observations, the effects of G. intraradices on dry matter production in potato plantlets were strongly dependent on the CO2 and PPF levels during cultivation. There was no significant effect of the mycorrhizal fungus on dry matter production at 350 ppm of CO2 However, under the high CO, concentration, mycorrhiza had opposite effects on dry matter production depending on the PPF: a decrease (-21%) and a stimulation (+25%) of dry matter production after 2 wk of growth under low and high PPF, respectively, were observed in presence of G. intraradices relative to plantlets grown in its absence. Furthermore, in mycorrhizal plantlets grown under high levels of both PPF and CO2 the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents as well as the quantum yields of photosynthetic electron transport and the photochemical quenching qP of the chlorophyll-a fluorescence measured near the PPF during growth were all higher than in non-infected plantlets. Our results therefore indicate that mycorrhizal G. intraradices can alleviate the down regulation of photosynthesis related to sink limitation, and its effect on dry matter production is strongly dependent on the levels of CO2 and PPF during growth which determine the balance between the photosynthetic carbon uptake by the plantlets and the carbon cost by the fungus.concentration, mycorrhiza had opposite effects on dry matter production depending on the PPF: a decrease (-21%) and a stimulation (+25%) of dry matter production 2655^5^Bonghi,C^Ramina,A^Ruperti,B^Vidrih,R^Tonutti,P^1999^1^Peach fruit ripening and quality in relation to picking time, and hypoxic and high CO2 short-term postharvest treatments^259^16^3^213-222^^^^^Jul^^^^^80681556^3737^374^454^560^845^ll and carotenoid contents as well as the quantum yields of photosynthetic electron transport and the photochemical quenching qP of the chlorophyll-a fluorescence measured near the PPF during growth were all higher than in non-infected plantlets.

The decline in flesh firmness was strongly reduced by ULO and CO2 treatments in fruits of both harvests, although the effect was stronger in fruits picked earlier in which ethylene biosynthesis remained at the basal level. In fruits of the second harvest, endo beta- 1,4-glucanase (EGase) activity was lower in ULO- and CO2- treated fruits than in control fruits at the end of the 24 h treatment and the following two days in air.

From 1994 to 1996 a total number of 25 OTC experiments were carried out. In addition, four growth chamber experiments focusing on key physiological processes of wheat growth in CO2- enriched air were performed. According to the specific needs for subsequent modelling purposes, environmental data were collected during experiments, i.e. air temperature, global radiation, humidity and trace gas concentrations. In the present paper results of these measurements are summarised. It was shown, that the OTC-experiments covered a considerable range of growing season mean-air-temperatures (13.0-23.4 degrees C) and global irradiances (10.8-18.1 MJ m(-2) d(-1)), the most important driving variables for crop growth simulation models.

Experiments were performed at different sites throughout Europe, over three consecutive growing-seasons using open-top chambers. This paper summarizes the main experimental findings of the effects of CO2 enrichment and other factors i.e. ozone (O-3), drought stress or nitrogen supply on the biomass and yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Minaret). Final harvest data from different sites and seasons were statistically analysed: (1) to identify main effects and interactions between experimentally controlled factors; and (2) to evaluate quantitative relationships between environmental variables and biological responses. Generally, 'Minaret' wheat did not respond significantly to O-3, suggesting that this cultivar is relatively tolerant to the O-3 levels applied. The main effect of CO2 was a significant enhancement of grain yield and above-ground biomass in almost all experiments. Significant interactions between CO2 and other factors were not common, although modifications in different N- and water supplies also led to significant effects on grain yield and biomass. In addition, climatic factors (in particular: mean air temperature and global radiation) were identified as important co-variables affecting grain yield or biomass, respectively. On average, the yield increase as a result of a doubling of [CO2] was 35% compared with that observed at ambient CO2 concentrations. However, linear regressions of grain yield or above-ground biomass for individual experiments revealed a large variability in the quantitative responses of 'Minaret' wheat to CO2 enrichment (yield increase ranging from 11 to 121%). Hence, CO2 responsiveness was shown to differ considerably when the same cultivar of wheat was grown at different European locations. Multiple regression analyses performed to evaluate the relative importance of the measured environmental parameters on grain yield indicated that although yield was significantly related to five independent variables (24 h mean CO2 concentration, 12 h mean O-3 concentration, temperature, radiation, and drought stress), a large proportion of the observed variability remained unexplained.

The results of the model intercomparison suggest that CO2 fertilization of natural terrestrial vegetation has the potential to account for a large fraction of the so-called "missing carbon sink" of 2.0 Pg C in 1990. Estimates of this potential are reduced when the models incorporate the concept that CO2 fertilization can be limited by nutrient availability. Although the model estimates differ on the potential size (126 to 461 Pg C) of the future terrestrial sink caused by CO2 fertilization, the results of the four models suggest that natural terrestrial ecosystems will have a limited capacity to act as a sink of atmospheric CO2 in the future as a result of physiological constraints and nutrient constraints on NPP. All the spatially explicit models estimate a carbon sink in both tropical and northern temperate regions, but the strength of these sinks varies over time. Differences in the simulated response of terrestrial ecosystems to CO2 fertilization among the models in this intercomparison study reflect the fact that the models have highlighted different aspects of the effect of CO2 fertilization on carbon dynamics of natural terrestrial ecosystems including feedback mechanisms.

At 0, 24, and 96 h, the amounts of CH4 and C2H4 consumed were determined. In both soils, we observed a parallel response of C2H4 and CH4 to all kinds and concentrations of amendments, plausibly due to co- metabolism of C2H4 by either methanotrophs or nitrifiers. Ammonium-N inhibited hydrocarbon oxidation in the deciduous forest soil, but promoted it in the acidic spruce forest soil. Ammonium addition narrowed the C:N ratio of the spruce forest soil which was characterized by low pH but high humus content. Therefore, the general living conditions for microorganisms might have been improved. Conversely, NO3- inhibited hydrocarbon oxidation in both soils, here a non-specific ion toxicity ('salt-effect') is discussed. CO2 also had an inhibitory effect on hydrocarbon microbial uptake at high concentrations, with its production increasing at elevated CO2 levels. We conclude that the impact of nitrogen inputs and of enhanced CO2 on the sink strength for hydrocarbons depends on the amount and the kind of addition as well as on soil type.
