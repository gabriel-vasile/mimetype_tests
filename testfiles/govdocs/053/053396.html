                <p>A freedman his entire life, Hiram Rhodes Revels was  the first African American to serve  in the U.S. Congress. With his moderate political orientation and oratorical  skills honed from years as a preacher, Revels filled a vacant seat in the  United States Senate in 1870. Just before the Senate agreed to admit a black  man to its ranks on February 25, Republican Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts sized up  the importance of the moment: &ldquo;All men are created equal, says the great  Declaration,&rdquo; Sumner roared, &ldquo;and now a great act attests this verity. Today we  make the Declaration a reality&hellip;. The Declaration was only half established  by Independence.  The greatest duty remained behind. In assuring the equal rights of all we  complete the work.&rdquo;<a href='#foot1' title='Footnote 1'><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>   Hiram  Rhodes Revels was born to free parents in Fayetteville,   North Carolina, on September 27,  1827. His father worked as a Baptist preacher, and his mother was of Scottish  descent. He claimed his ancestors &ldquo;as far back as my knowledge extends, were  free,&rdquo; and, in addition to his Scottish background, he was rumored to be of  mixed African and Croatan Indian lineage.<a href='#foot2' title='Footnote 2'><sup>2</sup></a>
  In an era when educating black children was illegal in North Carolina, Revels attended a school  taught by a free black woman and worked a few years as a barber. In 1844, he  moved north to complete his education. Revels attended the Beech Grove Quaker  Seminary in Liberty, Indiana,  and the Darke County Seminary for black students, in Ohio. In 1845, Revels was ordained in the  African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. His first pastorate was likely in Richmond, Indiana,  where he was elected an elder to the AME Indiana Conference in 1849.<a href='#foot3' title='Footnote 3'><sup>3</sup></a>
 In the early 1850s, Revels married Phoebe A.  Bass, a free black woman from Ohio,  and they had six daughters.<a href='#foot4' title='Footnote 4'><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>
<p>   Revels  traveled throughout the country, carrying out religious work and educating  fellow African Americans in Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  Although Missouri forbade free blacks to live  in the state for fear they would instigate uprisings, Revels took a pastorate  at an AME Church  in St. Louis in  1853, noting that the law was &ldquo;seldom enforced.&rdquo; However, Revels later revealed  he had to be careful because of restrictions on his movements. &ldquo;I sedulously  refrained from doing anything that would incite slaves to run away from their  masters,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;It being understood that my object was to preach the  gospel to them, and improve their moral and spiritual condition even slave  holders were tolerant of me.&rdquo;<a href='#foot5' title='Footnote 5'><sup>5</sup></a>
 Despite  his cautiousness, Revels was imprisoned for preaching to the black community in  1854. Upon his release, he accepted a position with the Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland,  working alongside his brother, Willis Revels, also an AME pastor. Hiram Revels  was the principal of a black school in Baltimore  and subsequently attended Knox College in Galesburg,   Illinois, graduating in 1857. He  was one of the few college-educated black men in the United States.</p>
<p>   When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Revels helped  recruit two black regiments from Maryland.  In 1862, when black soldiers were permitted to fight, he served as the chaplain  for a black regiment in campaigns in Vicksburg  and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1863, Revels returned to St. Louis, where he  established a freedmen&rsquo;s school. At the end of hostilities, Revels served in a  church in Leavenworth, Kansas. While traveling in Kansas, Revels and his family were asked to  sit in the smoking car rather than the car for first-class ticket holders.  Revels protested that the language in the smoking car was too coarse for his  wife and children, and the conductor finally relented. Revels served in  churches in Louisville, Kentucky,  and New Orleans, Louisiana,  before settling in Natchez,   Mississippi, in 1866.</p>
<p>   Before the Civil War, fewer than 1,000 free black  Mississippians had access to a basic education. Thus, leadership from freedmen  such as Revels became vital to the Republican Party for rallying the new  electorate in the postwar years.<a href='#foot6' title='Footnote 6'><sup>6</sup></a>
 It was  through his work in education that Revels became involved in politics, taking  his first elected position as a Natchez  alderman in 1868. He entered politics reluctantly, fearing racial friction and  interference with his religious work, but he quickly won over blacks and whites  with his moderate and compassionate political opinions. In 1869, encouraged to  run by a friend, future Representative John Roy Lynch, Revels won a seat in the  Mississippi  state senate.<a href='#foot7' title='Footnote 7'><sup>7</sup></a>
 Under the newly installed  Reconstruction government, Revels was one of more than 30 African Americans  among the state&rsquo;s 140 legislators.<a href='#foot8' title='Footnote 8'><sup>8</sup></a>
 Upon  his election, he wrote a friend in Leavenworth,   Kansas: &ldquo;We are in the midst of  an exciting canvass&hellip;. I am working very hard in politics as well as in  other matters. We are determined that Mississippi  shall be settled on a basis of justice and political and legal equality.&rdquo;<a href='#foot9' title='Footnote 9'><sup>9</sup></a>
 A little-known politician, Revels attracted  the attention of fellow legislators when he gave a moving prayer on the opening  day of the session. </p>
<p>   The primary task of the newly elected state senate was to  fill U.S. Senate seats. In 1861, Democrat Albert Brown and future Confederate  President Jefferson Davis both vacated Mississippi&rsquo;s  U.S. Senate seats when the state seceded from the Union.<a href='#foot10' title='Footnote 10'><sup>10</sup></a>
 When  their terms expired in 1865 and 1863, respectively, their seats were not filled  and remained vacant. In 1870, the new Mississippi state legislature wished to  elect a black man to fill the remainder of one term, due to expire in 1871 for  the seat once held by Brown, but was determined to fill the other unexpired  term, ending in 1875, with a white candidate.<a href='#foot11' title='Footnote 11'><sup>11</sup></a>
  Black legislators agreed to the deal, believing, as Revels recalled, that an  election of one of their own would &ldquo;be a weakening blow against color line  prejudice.&rdquo; The Democratic minority also endorsed the plan, hoping a black  Senator would &ldquo;seriously damage the Republican Party.&rdquo;<a href='#foot12' title='Footnote 12'><sup>12</sup></a>
 After three days and seven ballots, on  January 20, 1870, the Mississippi  state legislature voted 85 to 15 to seat Hiram Revels in Brown&rsquo;s former seat.  They chose Union General Adelbert Ames to fill Davis&rsquo;s former seat. </p>
<p>   Revels  arrived in Washington at the end of January  1870, but could not present his credentials until Mississippi  was readmitted to the United    States on February 23. Senate Republicans  sought to swear in Revels immediately afterwards, but Senate Democrats were  determined to block the effort. Led by Senator Garrett Davis of Kentucky and Senator Willard Saulsbury of Delaware, the Democrats claimed Revels&rsquo;s election was  null and void, arguing that Mississippi  was under military rule and lacked a civil government to confirm his election.  Others claimed Revels was not a U.S.  citizen until the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 and was therefore  ineligible to become a U.S. Senator. Senate Republicans rallied to his defense.  Though Revels would not fill Davis&rsquo;s  seat, the symbolism of a black man&rsquo;s admission to the Senate after the  departure of the former President of the Confederacy was not lost on Radical  Republicans. Nevada Senator James Nye underlined the significance of this  event: &ldquo;[Jefferson Davis] went out to establish a government whose cornerstone  should be the oppression and perpetual enslavement of a race because their skin  differed in color from his,&rdquo; Nye declared. &ldquo;Sir, what a magnificent spectacle  of retributive justice is witnessed here today! In the place of that proud,  defiant man, who marched out to trample under foot the Constitution and the  laws of the country he had sworn to support, comes back one of that humble race  whom he would have enslaved forever to take and occupy his seat upon this  floor.&rdquo;<a href='#foot13' title='Footnote 13'><sup>13</sup></a>
 On the afternoon of February  25, the Senate voted 48 to 8 to seat Revels, who subsequently received  assignments to the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>   Although  Revels viewed himself as &ldquo;a representative of the State, irrespective of  color,&rdquo; he also represented freedmen and, as such, received petitions from  black men and women from all states.<a href='#foot14' title='Footnote 14'><sup>14</sup></a>
  His sense that he represented his entire race was evident in his maiden speech,  in which he spoke in favor of reinstating black legislators forced from office  in Georgia.  In April 1868, Georgia  voters had ratified the state&rsquo;s constitution, enfranchising African Americans  and thus, under the terms of Congressional Reconstruction, taking a necessary  step toward the state&rsquo;s re-admission to the Union.  In the same election, Georgians sent 29 black legislators to the state house of  representatives and three to the state senate. Yet, when the legislature met in  July, moderate white Republicans joined Democrats in both chambers to unseat  the black members, arguing that the state constitution did not permit black  officeholders. Spurred to action, black Georgians appealed to Congress for  federal intervention before Georgia  was readmitted to the Union. On March 16,  1870, before a packed chamber and a gallery filled with black men and women,  Revels argued that the North and the Republican Party owed Georgian black  legislators their support: &ldquo;I remarked that I rose to plead for protection for  the defenseless race that now send their delegation to the seat of Government  to sue for that which this Congress alone can secure to them. And here let me  say further, that the people of the North owe to the colored race a deep  obligation that is no easy matter to fulfill.&rdquo;<a href='#foot15' title='Footnote 15'><sup>15</sup></a>
  In his speech, Revels professed his loyalty to and faith in the Republican  Party, claiming, &ldquo;the Republican party is not inflamed, as some would &hellip; have the country believe, against the white population of the South. Its  borders are wide enough for all truly loyal men to find within them some peace  and repose from the din and discord of angry faction.&rdquo;<a href='#foot16' title='Footnote 16'><sup>16</sup></a>
 The Georgia  legislature eventually agreed to a congressional mandate reinstating the  legislators as a requirement for re-entry into the Union  in July 1870.<a href='#foot17' title='Footnote 17'><sup>17</sup></a>
</p>
<p>   Revels  also favored universal amnesty for former Confederates, requiring only their  sworn loyalty to the Union. &ldquo;I am in favor of  removing the disabilities of those upon whom they are imposed in the South,  just as fast as they give evidence of having become loyal and being loyal,&rdquo;  Revels declared. &ldquo;If you can find one man in the South who gives evidence that  he is a loyal man, and gives that evidence in the fact that he has ceased to  denounce the laws of Congress as unconstitutional, has ceased to oppose them,  and respects them and favors the carrying of them out, I am in favor of  removing his disabilities.&rdquo;<a href='#foot18' title='Footnote 18'><sup>18</sup></a>
 Revels&rsquo;s  support for the bill, which eventually passed, solidified his reputation as a  political moderate. </p>
<p>   Although  Revels sided with Radical Republicans in opposing Ohio Senator Allen Thurman&rsquo;s  amendment perpetuating segregated schools in the District of Columbia, his views on social integration  of blacks and whites were less sanguine than those of his colleagues. Revels  clearly rejected legal separation of the races, believing it led to animosity  between blacks and whites, but he did not view forced social mixing as  desirable or necessary. He cited mixed-race churches in northern cities, where  a congregation would worship together on Sundays but part ways for the  remainder of the week. In one of his most gripping floor speeches, he said: &ldquo;I  find that the prejudice in this country to color is very great, and I sometimes  fear that it is on the increase&hellip;. If the nation should take a step for the  encouragement of this prejudice against the colored race, can they have any  grounds upon which to predicate a hope that Heaven will smile upon them and  prosper them?&rdquo;<a href='#foot19' title='Footnote 19'><sup>19</sup></a>
 As a former teacher,  Revels appreciated the need to educate freed slaves, claiming, &ldquo;The colored  race can be built up and assisted &hellip; in acquiring property, in becoming  intelligent, valuable, useful citizens, without one hair upon the head of any  white man being harmed.&rdquo;<a href='#foot20' title='Footnote 20'><sup>20</sup></a>
 Revels  believed the abolition of segregation statutes would result in less prejudice,  saying, &ldquo;Let lawmakers cease to make the difference, let school trustees and  school boards cease to make the difference, and the people will soon forget.&rdquo;<a href='#foot21' title='Footnote 21'><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>   With  mixed results, Revels also promoted Black Americans&rsquo; civil rights by less  conventional means. In May 1870, he startled the military establishment when he  nominated black candidate Michael Howard to the U.S. Army Military Academy at West Point, long a bastion of southern white gentlemen.  Revels knew Howard&rsquo;s parents, former slaves, and Howard&rsquo;s father had served in  the state legislature. Critics claimed Revels callously and publicly humiliated  the youth, who had little formal education and was not admitted to West Point, and supporters claimed the school  administration&rsquo;s prejudice had blocked Howard&rsquo;s entrance.<a href='#foot22' title='Footnote 22'><sup>22</sup></a>
 Additionally, Revels successfully appealed  to the War Department on behalf of black mechanics from Baltimore who were  barred from working at the U.S. Navy Yard in early 1871, an accomplishment he  recalled with great pride. <a href='#foot23' title='Footnote 23'><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>
<p> After  the expiration of his Senate term on March 3, 1871, Revels declined several  patronage positions, offered by President Ulysses S. Grant at the  recommendation of Senators Oliver Morton of Indiana  and Zachariah Chandler of Michigan.  He returned to Mississippi to become the first  president of Alcorn University (formerly Oakland College),  named for his political ally Governor James Alcorn. Located in Rodney,  Mississippi, Alcorn  University was the first land-grant  school in the United States  for black students.<a href='#foot24' title='Footnote 24'><sup>24</sup></a>
 Revels took a  leave of absence in 1873 to serve as Mississippi&rsquo;s  interim secretary of state after the sudden death of his friend James Lynch.  During this period, Revels grew more critical of the corruption in the  Republican Party, and he resigned from his position at Alcorn in 1874 to avoid  being removed by his political rival and former Senate colleague,  then-Mississippi Governor Adelbert Ames. Revels returned to the ministry,  taking a pastorate at a church in Holly  Springs, Mississippi. In the violent and  controversial 1875 election campaign, he supported several Democrats. In 1876,  when a U.S. Senate select committee questioned him about the well-documented  fraud and violence in the previous year&rsquo;s election, Revels testified that to  the best of his knowledge, conditions had been relatively peaceful and he was  unaware of any widespread violence. His statement was met with skepticism by  many Mississippi  black voters. Revels returned to his former position as president of Alcorn University  in July 1876. He also edited the <em>Southwestern Christian Advocate</em> newspaper, the official organ of the AME   Church. Revels retired in  1882 and returned to his former church in Holly Springs.  He remained active in the religious community, teaching theology at Shaw University  (later Rust College)  in Holly Springs,  Mississippi,  and serving as the AME&rsquo;s district superintendent. He died of a paralytic stroke  in Aberdeen, Mississippi, on January 16, 1901, while  attending a religious conference. </p>
