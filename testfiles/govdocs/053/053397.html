There have been 52 transits of Venus across the Sun between 2000 B.C and 1882 A.D. Humans could only have noticed this event if they
were watching the sun near the horizon at exactly the right time. 

<p>
There are no historical records that suggest anyone was so lucky prior to
                                                                 1639, although Montezuma may have spotted the 1520 transit while
                                                                 studying the Sun for portends. 

<p>

The Mayan civilization had a particular fascination with Venus because it
                                                                 was associated with their chief god Quetzalcoatl and one of his
                                                                 incarnations, Kulkulkan.

<br>                                                               
Galileo Galilee in 1610 was the first human to actually see Venus as more than just a bright point of light in the sky. Johannes Kepler,
meanwhile, was shaking up the world by his meticulous use of astronomical data assembled by Tycho Brahe. What he discovered during
these laborious hand calculations was that Venus would pass in front of the Sun on December 6th 1631, but the transit was not visible from
Europe at all.

<p> There is no known sighting of this transit in recorded history until the British Cleric, Jeremiah Horrocks and his friend William
Crabtree spotted it on December 4, 1639, and that is only because Horrocks had mathematically predicted this transit using better data
than Kepler had used.  Here is what Horrocks had to say about the transit.
<br>


<br>
<i>"Anxiously intent therefore on the undertaking through the greater part of the 23rd, and the whole of the 24th, I omitted no available opportunity of observing her ingress.
I watched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o'clock, and from a little before ten until noon, and at one in the afternoon, being called away in the intervals by
business of the highest importance, which, for these ornamental pursuits I could not with propriety neglect. But during all this time I saw nothing in the sun except a small
and common spot, consisting as it were of three points at a distance from the center towards the left, which I noticed on the preceding and following days. This evidently
had nothing to do with Venus. About fifteen minutes past three in the afternoon, when I was again at liberty to continue my labors, the clouds, as if by divine interposition,
were entirely dispersed, and I was once more invited to the grateful task of repeating my observations. I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle, the object of my sanguine
wishes, a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly circular shape, which had already fully entered upon the sun's disc on the left, so that the limbs of the Sun and
Venus precisely coincided, forming an angle of contact. Not doubting that this was really the shadow of the planet, I immediately applied 
myself sedulously to observe it"</i>
[Jeremiah Horrocks]

                                                        Although the transit of Venus is certainly a rare event in the
                                                        heavens, why would a scientist be interested in it? It all had
                                                        to do with something as simple as the size of the solar
                                                        system. When you make a scale model of the solar system
                                                        with its nine planets, how do you know that in this model, the
                                                        actual distance from Sun to Earth is 93 million miles and not,
                                                        say, 153 million or 23 million? The answer is that you have to
                                                        come up with a way to actually measure this distance.

                                                        In 1663, Rev. James Gregory (1638 - 1675) who was
                                                        considered one of the most important mathematicians of
                                                        the 17th century suggested that a more accurate
                                                        measurement of the Earth-Sun distance could be made
                                                        using the transit of Venus. (See picture top left)
<p>

                                                        Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742), the namesake for Halley's
                                                        Comet, made the same suggestion 14 years later in 1677 and
                                                        published an important paper on

                                                         in 1716. In science, it is not always 'being first' or
                                                        'being correct' that gets you into the history books.

                                                        Although the Sun-Earth distance did get refined enormously
                                                        during the transits of 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882, transit
                                                        measurements turned out to be harder to perfect than
                                                        scientists had anticipated. But the focus on Venus at this
                                                        crucial moment led to another, even more exciting
                                                        discovery.

Hundreds of photographs were taken of the next transit on December 8, 1874. This was the first use of the new technology.
Few photographic plates turned out to be scientifically useful, and only a few were actually preserved for us to look at
today. Eight American expeditions were organized by the Transit of Venus Commission, with astronomer Simon
Newcomb as Secretary. The U. S. Congress set aside funds totaling an astounding $177,000 for the expeditions. Over $1
million were expended internationally. 

<p>

The transit was still, largely, a scientific curiosity, but for the first time we begin to see more curiosity about this
phenomenon in the newspaper accounts.<p>

      During the 1882 transit, direct timing of the transit was all but abandoned, and thousands 
      of photographs were taken instead - with
 better calibration techniques. In the end, it took nearly ten years for the 
 thousands of photographs to be properly measured, and their
 data pushed through complex mathematical calculations.

      <br> 
      
      There was a huge amount of data to sift through in order to calculate the Earth-Sun distance, and there were only a few astronomers
 that the international community trusted to carry out the complex calculations. The two most noteworthy individuals were Simon
 Newcomb (left)and William Harkness. (right). 


<ul>
<li>
Simon Newcomb, who was in charge of the U.S. Venus Transit Commission, published his best estimate of the solar parallax
       angle in 1891, based on all of the assembled data from several transits, he deduced a value of 8.80 +/- 0.051" for the parallax
       angle, and a distance from Earth to Sun of 92,702,000 +/- 53,700 miles. 
</li>
     
<li>  
       William Harkness, the Director of the U.S. Naval Observatory, deduced a slightly larger value for the parallax angle of 8.809"
       +/- 0.0059", which translates to a distance of 92,797,000 +/- 59,700 miles. His result, however, was never formally published in the
       professional journals. 
</li>
</ul>


<p>

In the end, Newcomb's value, and not the one by Harkness, was adopted in 1896 by the international scientific community. The
 difference between the two answers was a statistically insignificant 95,000 miles!
 
 <p>
 

 Of course today, most textbooks report the Astronomical Unit (or AU) as '93 million miles'. Yet, Harkness may have had the 'final word' on
 this transit in other ways than in the details of its measurement. <p>

 One of the loveliest comments made by a scientist during this time was when Harkness noted in 1882 that the next transit of Venus will
 occur, "when the June flowers are blooming in 2004,". The longer version of this quote reads:
 <p>
 
 <i><font size="3">"We are now on the eve of the second transit of a pair, after which there will be no other till the twenty-first century of our era has dawned upon the earth, and the June
 flowers are blooming in 2004. When the last transit season occurred the intellectual world was awakening from the slumber of ages, and that wondrous scientific
 activity which has led to our present advanced knowledge was just beginning. What will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives God only knows.
 Not even our children's children will live to take part in the astronomy of that day. As for ourselves, 
 we have to do with the present ..." 
</i></font>

<p>
A similar comment was made by the Astronomer Royal of Ireland, Robert Stawell Ball (1840-1913) in his 1885 book 'The Story of the
 Heavens'. He gave over 700 popular lectures on astronomy, and was in great demand in Ireland and Britain. An excerpt from this book,
 which was published three years after Harkness's lecture and the above quotes, reads: 
<p>

 <i><font size="3">"While steadily looking at the exquisitely beautiful sight of the gradual advance of the planet, I became aware that there were other objects besides Venus between me
 and the sun. They were the snowflakes, which again began to fall rapidly. I must admit the phenomenon was singularly beautiful. The telescopic effect of a snowstorm
 with the sun as a background I had never before seen. It reminded me of the golden rain which is sometimes seen falling from a flight of sky-rockets during pyrotechnic
 displays; but I would gladly have dispensed with the spectacle, for it necessarily followed that the sun and Venus again disappeared from view. Still, to have seen even a
 part of a transit of Venus is an event to remember for a lifetime, and we felt more delight than can be easily expressed at even this slight gleam of success. The clouds at
 length dispersed, and this time Venus had so completely entered on the sun that the distance from the edge of the planet to the edge of the sun was about twice the
 diameter of the planet.
 
 <p>

 We succeeded in obtaining sixteen measures altogether, but the sun was now getting low, the clouds again to interfere, and we saw the pursuit of the transit must be left
 to the thousands of astronomers in happier climes who had been eagerly awaiting it. But before the phenomenon had ceased, I spared a few minutes from the
 somewhat mechanical work at the micrometer to take a view of the transit in the more picturesque form which the large field of the finder presents. The sun was already
 beginning to put on the ruddy hues of sunset, and there, far in on its face, was the sharp, round, black disk of Venus. It was then easy to sympathize with the supreme
 joy of Horrocks, when, in 1639, he for the first time witnessed this spectacle. The intrinsic interest of the phenomenon, its rarity, the fulfillment of the prediction, the
 noble problem which the transit of Venus helps us to solve, are all present to our thoughts when we look at this pleasing picture, a repetition of which will not occur
 again until the flowers are blooming in the June of A. D. 2004."

                                            In 1931, parallax observations of the close approach of the
                                            asteroid Eros by British astronomer Harold Spencer Jones
                                            offered an even more precise value for the 'Astronomical
                                            Unit' of 92,596,000. 
<p>
                                            Once astronomers began bouncing radar signals off Venus in
                                            the 1960's, even more precise values could be derived from
                                            the travel time of the reflected radar pulses. The current
                                            super-precise value for the Astronomical Unit stands at 149,597,892.3 kilometers (92,955,820.3 miles) with
                                            an uncertainty of 1.5 kilometers.
                                             
                                            
                         
<p>

                                                 The earlier discovery of the atmosphere of Venus by Lomonosov inspired astronomers
                                                 during the 1874 and 1882 transits to use a new technology called spectroscopy to
                                                 detect the elements in the atmosphere. But all they could conclude, and wrongly, was
                                                 that there seemed to be a lot of water in the atmosphere. 
<p>
                                                 Then in 1934, astronomers Walter Adams and Theodore Dunham used even more
                                                 refined spectroscopic instruments to finally detect a gaseous component to the
                                                 atmosphere. It wasn't nitrogen, oxygen or any other simple gas, instead it was carbon
                                                 dioxide. Lots of it! In fact so far as they could tell, carbon dioxide was the only
                                                 constituent of the atmosphere. 
<p>
                                                 Decades later, astronomers also discovered traces of sulfuric acid, and went on to
                                                 make the first measurement of the surface temperature of Venus. It was hardly a moist,
                                                 tropical and humid planet like some science fiction stories had claimed. Instead, its
                                                 surface was at a sizzling temperature of over 800 Fahrenheit with an atmosphere thick
                                                 enough to crush any human or machine not properly protected.
