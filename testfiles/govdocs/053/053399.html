Testimony of Roger Pilon<br>
Senior Fellow<br>
Center for Constitutional Studies<br>
CATO Institute</center></h2><p>


Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the subcommittee:<P>

     My name is Roger Pilon.  I am a senior fellow at the Cato
Institute and the director of Cato's Center for Constitutional
Studies.<P>

     I want to begin by thanking Chairman Hyde of the Committee on
the Judiciary for inviting me to testify before the subcommittee on
"H.J. Res. 54: Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States Authorizing Congress to Prohibit the Physical
Desecration of the Flag of the United States."<P>

     I have had the pleasure of working with Chairman Hyde in the
past on several issues and look forward to working with him in the
future on many others.  On the issue before the subcommittee today,
however, I am afraid I must demur, taking a position opposite that
of Chairman Hyde and many on this subcommittee.  In fact, because
this issue separates me from so many with whom I normally join
hands, I sense a special burden to show why I believe this proposed
amendment is unwise--indeed, is fundamentally mistaken.<P>

     Let me begin to discharge that burden by making clear from the
outset what should be beyond any doubt, namely, that I am not here
to defend those who would desecrate the flag of the United States. 
I dare say, in fact, that my contempt for such action is equal to
that of any member of this subcommittee.  For the flag is not
simply the symbol of America; more deeply, it is the symbol of the
principles on which this nation rests.  Those who would desecrate
the flag are thus guilty, at bottom, of desecrating our principles,
which is why we find their acts so offensive.  Ironically, however,
it is those very principles that protect such acts--and restrain
the rest of us in the process.<P>

     In a word, therefore, I am here not to defend flag desecration
but to defend the right to desecrate the flag, offensive as the
exercise of that right may be to so many Americans.  That position
may strike some as contradictory.  It is not.  In fact, there is
all the difference in the world between defending the right to
desecrate the flag and defending flag desecration itself.  It is
the difference between a free and an unfree society.  This
amendment, as it tries to shield us from offensive behavior, gives
rise to even greater offense.  By offending our very principles, it
undermines its essential purpose, making us all less free.<P>

     Let me plumb those issues a bit more deeply by noting, first,
that flag desecration of a kind that this amendment would authorize
Congress to prohibit is political expression and, second, that
political expression is precisely what the Framers wanted most to
protect when they drafted the First Amendment.  In a pair of cases
decided in 1989 and 1990--involving first a state, then a federal
statute--the United States Supreme Court said as much, which is why
those who want to prohibit people from engaging in such acts have
resorted to a constitutional amendment--an amendment that would,
for the first time in over 200 years, amend the First Amendment. 
That alone should give pause.<P>

     But it is not the First Amendment alone that protects the
rights of political expression.  Even before the Bill of Rights was
ratified, two years after the Constitution itself was ratified,
citizens were protected against overweening federal power by a
simple yet profound expedient--the doctrine of enumerated powers. 
In a word, there was simply no power enumerated in the Constitution
through which the federal government might abridge political
expression.  Arguing against the addition of a Bill of Rights in
Federalist 84, Alexander Hamilton put the point well: "Why declare
that things shall not be done [by the federal government] which
there is no power to do?"  This amendment would expand federal
power in a way the Framers plainly contemplated--and rejected.<P>

     It is crucial, however, to understand precisely why the
Framers wanted to protect political expression.  To be sure, they
thought such expression was essential to the workings of a free
society: democracy works, after all, only when people are free to
participate in the processes through which they govern themselves. 
But it was not a concern for good consequences alone that drove the
Framers: more deeply, they were concerned about the simple matter
of protecting rights, whatever the consequences of doing so.  The
protection of our rights is tested, however, not when what we do or
say is popular but when it is unpopular.  Stated most starkly, a
free society is tested by the way it protects the rights of its
least popular members.<P>

     Sir Winston Churchill captured well that essential feature of
our system when he observed in 1945 that "the United States is a
land of free speech.  Nowhere is speech freer--not even [in
England], where we sedulously cultivate it even in its most
repulsive forms."  In so observing, Churchill was merely echoing
thoughts attributed to Voltaire, that he may disapprove of what you
say but would defend to the death your right to say it, and the
ironic question of Benjamin Franklin: "Abuses of the freedom of
speech ought to be repressed; but to whom are we to commit the
power of doing it?"<P>

     When so many for so long have understood the principles at
issue today, how can this Congress so lightly abandon those
principles?  It is said by some that the flag is a special case, a
unique symbol.  That claim may be true, but it does not go to the
principle of the matter: in a free society, individuals have a
right to express themselves, even in offensive ways.  Once we bar
such expression, however, Franklin's question will immediately be
upon us.  What is more, we will soon find that the flag is not
unique, that the Bible and much else will next be in line for
special protection.<P>

     It is said also that the flag is special because men have
fought and died for it.  Let me suggest in response that men have
fought and died not for the flag but for the principles it
represents.  People give their lives for principles, not for
symbols.  When we dishonor those principles, to protect their
symbol, we dishonor the men who died to preserve them.  That is not
a business this Congress should be about.  We owe it to those men,
men who have made the ultimate sacrifice, to resist the pressures
of the moment so that we may preserve the principles of the ages.
