<P>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This case concerns Congress's actions to bring federal judges within
the Medicare hospital insurance (HI) pro-</P>

<P>gram and Social Security old-age, survivors, and disability insurance
(OASDI) program by extending coverage under those programs, as well as the
taxes financing those programs, to the employment of Article III judges.
The questions presented are:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. Whether Congress violated the Compensation Clause, U.S. Const. Art.
III, &sect; 1, when it extended the taxes financing the HI and OASDI programs
to the judicial salaries of respondents, who were sitting Article III judges
at the time those taxes were first applied to judicial salaries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. Whether any constitutional violation ended when Congress increased
the statutory salaries of federal judges by an amount greater than the amount
of HI and OASDI taxes deducted from respondents' judicial salaries.</P>

<P>BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>OPINIONS BELOW</P>

<P>The initial decision of the United States Claims Court, dismissing this
case for lack of jurisdiction (Pet. App. 12a-18a), is reported at 21 Cl.
Ct. 786. The decision of the court of appeals reversing that dismissal (Pet.
App. 19a-29a) is reported at 953 F.2d 626. The decision of the Court of
Federal Claims on remand, dismissing respondents' claims on the merits (Pet.
App. 30a-53a), is reported at 31 Fed. Cl. 436. The decision of the court
of appeals reversing that dismissal (Pet. App. 54a-66a) is reported at 64
F.3d 647. The decision of this Court, affirming that decision of the court
of appeals under 28 U.S.C. 2109 because of the lack of a quorum (Pet. App.
69a), is reported at 519 U.S. 801.</P>

<P>The further decision of the Court of Federal Claims on remand, ruling
in favor of the government on the issues of damages and the statute of limitations
and awarding some respondents limited damages (Pet. App. 70a-111a), is reported
at 38 Fed. Cl. 166. The opinion of the panel of the court of appeals reversing
the Court of Federal Claims as to damages (Pet. App. 112a-127a) is reported
at 185 F.3d 1356. The order of the court of appeals vacating the panel's
judgment and ordering rehearing en banc on the issue of the statute of limitations
(Pet. App. 128a-129a) is reported at 199 F.3d 1316. The opinion of the en
banc court of appeals, reversing the Court of Federal Claims on both damages
and statute of limitations (Pet. App. 1a-11a), is reported at 203 F.3d 795.</P>

<P>JURISDICTION</P>

<P>The judgment of the en banc court of appeals was entered on February
9, 2000. On May 2, 2000, the Chief Justice extended the time for filing
a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including June 8, 2000. The petition
for a writ of certiorari was filed on June 8, 2000, and was granted on October
16, 2000 (J.A. 143). This Court's jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).</P>

<P>CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY</P>

<P>PROVISIONS INVOLVED</P>

<P>The Compensation Clause, U.S. Const. Art. III, &sect; 1, and pertinent
provisions of 26 U.S.C. 3101 and 3121 (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998) are set
forth in the appendix to the petition for a writ of certiorari (Pet. App.
130a-132a).</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>1. More than 90% of the paid civilian labor force in the United States
is engaged in employment covered by the Social Security old-age, survivors,
and disability insurance (OASDI) program and the Medicare hospital insurance
(HI) program. J.A. 41. Employees earn credits towards eligibility for OASDI
and HI benefits based on their employment.1 Both programs are financed in
part out of taxes imposed &quot;on the income of every individual,&quot;
in amounts equal to certain percentages of an employee's wages. See 26 U.S.C.
3101(a) and (b).</P>

<P>Before 1983, the employment of Article III judges, as well as almost
all other federal employees, was excluded from both taxes and benefits under
the HI and OASDI programs. Federal judges and other federal employees were
covered by separate retirement systems. Since 1869, Article III judges have
been entitled to retire after meeting certain age and service requirements
and to receive lifetime annuities equal to their salary at their retirement.
Those annuities are financed entirely from general tax revenues. See 28
U.S.C. 371(a); Act of Apr. 10, 1869, ch. 22, &sect; 5, 16 Stat. 45. Beginning
in 1920, most other federal employees were eligible to receive retirement
annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) upon meeting
certain service requirements, and were also required to contribute part
of their salary to finance the CSRS program. See 5 U.S.C. 8331</P>

<P>et seq.; 5 U.S.C. 719 (1925) (mandatory deduction from federal employees'
salary to finance retirement system); Act of May 22, 1920, ch. 195, 41 Stat.
614. Federal judges and employees could, however, receive OASDI and HI benefits
based on their non-federal employment if they had accrued sufficient credits
in such employment (and in some cases based on their spouses' coverage).</P>

<P>On January 1, 1983, employees in all three Branches of the federal government,
including judges, first began to earn credits for HI coverage on the basis
of their federal employment, and also first became subject to the HI tax
on their salaries. One year later, on January 1, 1984, newly hired federal
employees and judges began to earn credits for Social Security old-age benefits
on the basis of their federal service, and also became subject to the OASDI
tax on their salaries.2 The 1983 and 1984 amendments also imposed HI and
OASDI taxes for the first time on the salaries of the President, Vice President,
cabinet members, political appointees in the Senior Executive Service, and
Members of Congress. Those employees and officials remain subject to HI
and OASDI taxes today. See 26 U.S.C. 3121(b)(5) (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998).</P>

<P>Congress brought federal employees, including federal judges, within
the HI and OASDI systems in part out of concern that those employees were
not paying a fair share of the cost of financing benefits under those programs,
which are funded out of current HI and OASDI taxes. When Congress in 1982
enacted legislation to bring federal employees within the HI system, the
Senate Finance Committee noted as follows:</P>

<P>Many active Federal civilian employees have worked long enough (or their
spouses have) in employment covered by social security to become insured
under the Hospital Insurance program. However, while most workers in covered
social security employment are subject to the Hospital Insurance tax throughout
their entire working careers, Federal employees may earn the same coverage
with relatively fewer years of work subject to the tax. The committee believes
that Federal workers should bear a more equitable share of the costs of
financing the benefits to which many of them eventually become entitled.</P>

<P>The bill, therefore, extends Medicare coverage to all members of the
Federal workforce in the same way coverage is provided to most other workers.</P>

<P>S. Rep. No. 494, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. Vol. 1, at 378 (1982). Similarly,
when Congress in 1983 enacted legislation to bring many federal employees
(including federal judges) within the Social Security old-age benefit system,
the House Ways and Means Committee observed that the expansion of coverage
to include &quot;several groups of workers previously excluded from participation
in the program&quot; was intended to &quot;maintain the social security
program on a sound financial basis&quot; and to &quot;assur[e] both the
short-term and long-term financial stability of the program.&quot; H.R.
Rep. No. 25, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1983).</P>

<P>When Congress considered extending OASDI benefits and taxes to federal
employment in 1983, it recognized that doing so could subject federal employees
under the CSRS program to a double imposition-the mandatory contribution
to CSRS and the OASDI tax. Congress also recognized that many federal employees
had long relied on the CSRS to make retirement and estate plans. Thus, to
treat incumbent federal workers as equally as possible to other wage earners,
Congress allowed them to continue to participate in CSRS rather than the
OASDI program. See H.R. Rep. No. 25, supra, at 14; J.A. 112-113. Federal
judges, however, were not subject to any similar mandatory civil-service
retirement contribution, as they are entitled to retire on an annuity financed
out of general tax revenues. Thus, Congress had no occasion to permit judges
to &quot;opt out&quot; of the OASDI program to avoid a double imposition.3
Moreover, after 1984, federal judges earned coverage for OASDI benefits
(in addition to the lifetime annuity provided under 28 U.S.C. 371 (1994
&amp; Supp. IV 1998)) based on their judicial employment, whereas other
incumbent federal employees who continued to participate in the CSRS program
remained ineligible for OASDI benefits based on their federal employment.</P>

<P>2. On December 29, 1989, eight federal judges4 (the &quot;early-filing
judges&quot;) filed suit against the United States in the United States
Claims Court (the predecessor to the Court of Federal Claims). They contended
that Congress had unconstitutionally diminished their compensation, in violation
of the Compensation Clause, U.S. Const. Art. III,</P>

<P>&sect; 1, when, on January 1, 1984, it made their judicial salaries subject
to the OASDI tax.5 J.A. 23-27. Those eight judges were all sitting judges
as of January 1, 1984, when the OASDI tax first became applicable to judicial
salaries. The judges did not contend that Congress had diminished their
prescribed statutory salary. Rather, they contended that the incidence of
the OASDI tax on their salary on January 1, 1984, effectively and unconstitutionally
diminished that salary, and that the unconstitutional diminution continued
to the present day, despite substantial salary increases received by those
judges after January 1, 1984.6</P>

<P>The Claims Court initially dismissed the suit on jurisdictional grounds,
but the court of appeals reversed and remanded, ruling that the lower court
had jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1491(a). Pet. App. 19a-29a.7
On remand, respondents filed a second amended complaint on January 11, 1993.
That amended complaint added eight more judges (the &quot;later-filing judges&quot;)
as new plaintiffs.8 The new complaint also challenged for the first time
(on behalf of all respondents) the constitutionality of the HI tax, which
had first been imposed on judicial salaries on January 1, 1983. J.A. 34.
The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the court granted summary
judgment for the United States, concluding that the application of the OASDI
and HI taxes to respondents' judicial salaries was constitutional. Pet.
App. 30a-53a.</P>

<P>3. The court of appeals reversed, and held that Congress's extension
of the HI and OASDI taxes to the salaries of already-commissioned federal
judges violated the Compensation Clause. Pet. App. 54a-66a. The court found
this case controlled by Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920), which held that
the Compensation Clause prohibited the imposition of the federal income
tax on the salary of a federal judge who had been appointed before Congress
brought judicial salaries within the income subject to federal income tax.
Pet. App. 59a. The court acknowledged (id. at 59a-60a) that this Court's
subsequent decision in O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939), upheld
the application of the income tax to the salaries of federal judges who took office after the income tax
was enacted. Nonetheless, the court concluded that it was required to follow
Evans rather than O'Malley because this Court had not expressly overruled
Evans. See Pet. App. 60a-61a. It therefore remanded the case for a determination
of the amount to which the HI and OASDI taxes had diminished respondents'
compensation. Id. at 65a-66a.</P>

<P>4. The United States filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. Four
Justices recused themselves from consideration of the petition. Because
of those recusals, the Court lacked a quorum of six Justices to consider
the petition. The Court therefore entered an order under 28 U.S.C. 2109,
which provides that, when a quorum of the Court is absent, the judgment
of the court of appeals shall be affirmed with the same effect as an affirmance
by an equally divided Court. See United States v. Hatter, 519 U.S. 801 (1996);
Pet. App. 69a.</P>

<P>5. On remand from the court of appeals, the Court of Federal Claims ruled
that all the claims of the later-filing judges (see p. 9, supra) and all
the respondents' claims based on the HI tax were barred by the six-year
statute of limitations for actions against the United States (see 28 U.S.C.
2401(a), 2501). Pet. App. 90a-105a.9 The court also ruled, as to the early-filing
judges' claims based on the OASDI tax, that any constitutional violation
had come to an end in 1984 when Congress granted judges a salary increase
that exceeded the amount of the OASDI tax applied to their salaries on January
1, 1984. Id. at 78a-89a.</P>

<P>On the latter point, the court observed that, &quot;if, simultaneously
with the imposition of a new tax, Congress granted an increase in salary
which equaled or exceeded the tax, no diminution in the level of compensation
just prior to imposition of the tax would have occurred.&quot; Pet. App.
79a. If that is so, the court reasoned, then any constitutional violation
caused by the imposition of a new tax must also terminate when Congress
raises judges' salaries &quot;in an amount equal to or greater than the
amount of the tax[.] * * * [I]f an increase in nominal salary occurred simultaneously with
or subsequent to * * * a diminution, the simultaneous or subsequent increase
accomplishes a cure to the extent of such increase.&quot; Id. at 82a. Otherwise,
the court noted, Congress could never bring to an end a violation of the
Compensation Clause caused by the initial application of a new tax except
by repealing the tax (or by specifically granting the affected judges compensation
for the tax). Indeed, the court observed that, in respondents' view, even
&quot;if Congress awarded all judges a pay raise of $1,000,000 per year
retroactive to January 1, 1983 but not specifically or expressly related
to the Social Security taxes imposed in 1983 or 1984, it would not cure
the diminution resulting from imposition of the taxes,&quot; and &quot;all
Social Security taxes withheld must be refunded to plaintiffs and there
can absolutely be no cure by subsequent increases in salary&quot; granted
to all federal judges. Id. at 83a-84a.</P>

<P>The court also found that Congress had in fact raised judges' salaries
in an amount greater than the OASDI tax imposed on those salaries on January
1, 1984. Pet. App. 86a-87a. It also calculated that judges' salary increases
over the pre-1984 compensation base exceeded in each year the total amount
that judges paid in HI and OASDI taxes in that year, until by 1993, the
annual sums represented by the successive pay increases &quot;are more than
ten times higher than the total of Social Security taxes withheld during
any calendar year.&quot; See id. at 89a-90a. Based on those facts, the court
concluded that &quot;no unlawful diminution in judicial compensation occurred&quot;
after respondents' salary increase in 1984 took effect. See id. at 89a.</P>

<P>The court therefore limited damages to the single deduction of OASDI
taxes that occurred before the 1984 salary increase took effect. Because
judges are paid on the first day of each calendar month for services rendered
during the previous month, the court concluded that the OASDI tax deducted
from the judges' salary payment on January 1, 1984 was in fact a tax on
their salary earned during December 1983. Pet. App. 77a. The court accordingly
entered judgment for respondents in the amount of the OASDI tax deducted
from judges' salaries on January 1, 1984-$328.95 for the seven early-filing
district judges and $347.85 for the early-filing circuit judge-with compound
interest. Id. at 77a, 110a-111a.</P>

<P>6. A panel of the court of appeals reversed the Court of Federal Claims'
holding that the constitutional violation terminated upon the judges' first
salary increase following the initial incidence of the OASDI tax, Pet. App.
116a-125a, but affirmed the dismissal of the HI tax claims and all the later-filing
judges' claims as time-barred, id. at 125a-127a.</P>

<P>On the former point, the court of appeals rejected the trial court's
conclusion that any unconstitutional diminution in judicial compensation
caused by application of the OASDI tax to judicial salaries terminated when
Congress enacted a general increase in judicial salaries that exceeded the
amount of the new tax. In the court of appeals' view, the trial court's
approach was deficient because it &quot;would create, with regard to judicial
compensation, two different classes of judges.&quot; Pet. App. 122a. As
the court of appeals put the matter, if the trial court's conclusion were
upheld, then those judges who took office after Congress extended OASDI
taxes to sitting judges could enjoy &quot;the full benefit of congressionally-granted
salary increases&quot; subsequent to those dates. Ibid. On the other hand,
those judges who took office before OASDI taxes were applied to judicial
salaries &quot;would not receive the Congressionally-granted salary increases
which became effective after 1983, because a significant portion of the
increases would be allocated to pay the damage award to which they are entitled
as a result of the earlier unconstitutional imposition.&quot; Ibid. The
court also remarked that Congress had granted federal judges salary increases
to adjust for inflation, and that &quot;[t]o deprive the pre-1983 judges
of the benefit of those increases by using them to offset the losses they
incurred from the Government's earlier wrongful act would not only be unfair,
but would be contrary to Congress's purpose in granting the increases.&quot;
Id. at 125a. Thus, it held, any determination of the duration of a violation
of the Compensation Clause and any calculation of damages must be &quot;independent
of any generally awarded adjustment to judicial salaries.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>7. Both the United States and respondents sought rehearing and rehearing
en banc. The court of appeals denied the United States' petition but granted
respondents' petition, which contested the panel's decision that the later-filing
judges' claims and all claims based on the HI tax were time-barred. Pet.
App. 128a-129a. On rehearing en banc, the court held that respondents' claims
challenging both the OASDI and the HI taxes were timely, insofar as they
challenged the taxes deducted from their salaries within six years before
the claim was filed. Id. at 2a-11a.10 The en banc court at that time also
reinstated the judgment of the panel, insofar as it had reversed the trial
court's determination that the Compensation Clause violation came to an
end when Congress granted judges a general salary increase. See id. at 1a-2a.</P>

<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>

<P>Congress's extension of the Social Security old-age, survivors and disability
insurance (OASDI) and Medicare hospital insurance (HI) taxes to the salaries
of sitting federal judges did not unconstitutionally diminish the compensation
of those judges within the meaning of the Compensation Clause, U.S. Const.
Art. III, &sect; 1. The application and extension of a generally applicable,
non-discriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges does not implicate
the Compensation Clause. Nor did Congress impermissibly discriminate against
federal judges when it extended the OASDI and HI taxes to their salaries.
Furthermore, even if there had been any unconstitutional diminution when
those taxes were first deducted from sitting judges' salaries, any such constitutional
violation would have terminated when Congress increased statutory judicial
salaries in an amount that exceeded the amount of the OASDI and HI taxes.</P>

<P>I. A. The court of appeals relied on Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920),
to conclude that the application of the OASDI and HI taxes to sitting judges'
salaries violated the Compensation Clause. This Court should now definitively
overrule Evans v. Gore. In Evans, the Court concluded that the Compensation
Clause barred the application of the federal income tax to the salary of
an Article III judge; that judge happened to have been appointed to his
judicial office before the tax was enacted, but that fact was not part of
the Court's rationale in Evans. The Court's subsequent cases have repudiated
Evans. In O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939), and United States
v. Will, 449 U.S. 200 (1980), the Court made clear that the application
of a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salary of a federal
judge is not an impermissible diminution of his compensation within the
prohibition of the Compensation Clause.</P>

<P>The doctrinal basis of the Court's decision in Evans has long been demonstrated
to be unsound. Evans relied heavily on the Court's intergovernmental tax
immunity cases prohibiting the federal government and the States from applying
their income taxes to the salaries of each other's employees, such as Collector
v. Day, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 113 (1871), but the Court has since overruled
that entire line of decisions. Evans also claimed support in state-court
decisions construing similar provisions under state constitutions, but in
fact the weight of state authority is to the contrary, as are decisions
of courts in other English-speaking countries. Evans also cited a private
1862 letter of Chief Justice Taney and an 1869 opinion of Attorney General
Hoar, but they also lend the decision in Evans little support. In sum, Evans
has not withstood closer examination and the test of time and should be
disapproved.</P>

<P>Respondents have argued that Congress's extension of OASDI and HI taxes
to their salaries nonetheless constituted a diminution of their compensation
because, after the taxes took effect, they were left with less &quot;effective&quot;
compensation in the form of take-home pay than they had before the taxes
were extended to their salaries. The &quot;Compensation&quot; that is protected
from diminution by the Constitution, however, is the judges' statutory salary,
not their &quot;effective&quot; salary or take-home pay after taxes are
deducted. Respondents' construction, if accepted, might well lead to the
conclusion that Congress is constitutionally prohibited from granting the
President tax relief that is made available to the general population (since
the President's &quot;Compensation&quot; may not be increased or diminished
during his term of office) or extending generally applicable taxes to their
own salaries (since no law may vary the &quot;Compensation&quot; of Members
until an election of Representatives has intervened). Respondents' construction
would also suggest that Congress may not adjust even the rates of income
tax applicable to the salaries of sitting federal judges, the President,
or Members of Congress. These implausible consequences show that respondents'
construction should be rejected.</P>

<P>Respondents' theory also has no basis in the policies of the Compensation
Clause. The Clause is intended to protect judicial independence and to attract
persons of high caliber to judicial service. A nondiscriminatory tax poses
no threat to judicial independence. Similarly, while federal judges might
well be concerned that Congress could use its power over their statutory
salary to deprive them of adequate support, any concern that Congress would
manipulate taxes of general applicability for such a purpose is without
substance, because federal judges, like all members of the public, have
the protection of the political process against excessively burdensome taxes
that are generally applicable. Moreover, in bringing judges within the OASDI
and HI programs, Congress also gave judges significant benefits, and respondents
have pointed to nothing suggesting that OASDI and HI taxes have driven federal
judges out of service.</P>

<P>B. Congress's extension of OASDI and HI taxes to judges did not impermissibly
discriminate against respondents. In 1983 and 1984, Congress simply brought
federal judges within a program that covers 90% of the civilian labor force.
Congress therefore did at that time what it could have unquestionably done
in 1935 when it first established the Social Security program, namely, subject
judicial salaries to a generally applicable tax. Although Congress in 1984
allowed other incumbent federal employees to remain excluded from the OASDI
program, it did so only because it recognized that subjecting those employees
to OASDI taxes as well as mandatory contributions for the existing Civil
Service Retirement System (CSRS) would have made those employees subject
to a double imposition for retirement income security. Federal judges were
not similarly situated, because they were and are entitled to receive a
lifetime annuity equal to the full salary received at the time of retirement,
entirely at taxpayer expense, and so their salaries were not subject to
deduction for CSRS or other retirement contributions.</P>

<P>II. Even if Congress did impermissibly diminish the compensation of sitting
judges when it brought them within the HI and OASDI programs, that diminution
terminated in 1984 when Congress increased judicial salaries in an amount
greater than the amount of the new HI and OASDI taxes. After that increase,
each judge received greater compensation, even net of the HI and OASDI taxes,
than the judge had received before those taxes were first imposed. Congress
therefore cannot be charged with any &quot;diminution&quot; in judicial
compensation for periods after the enactment of the salary increases for
federal judges.</P>

<P>ARGUMENT</P>

<P>I. CONGRESS DID NOT VIOLATE THE COMPENSATION CLAUSE WHEN IT EXTENDED
SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES TO JUDICIAL SALARIES</P>

<P>A. The Application Of A Nondiscriminatory Tax To Judicial Salaries Does
Not Violate The Compensation Clause</P>

<P>1. Evans v. Gore, On Which The Court Of Appeals Relied, Should Be Overruled</P>

<P>In holding that the application of OASDI and HI taxes to sitting judges
violated the Compensation Clause, the court of appeals believed itself bound
by this Court's decision in Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920), which held
that the Compensation Clause barred the application of the federal income
tax to federal judges' salaries. Evans should now be definitively overruled.
Not only have this Court's own subsequent decisions expressly undermined
the reasoning of Evans, but that decision rests on a serious misunderstanding
of the Compensation Clause.</P>

<P>a. This Court's subsequent decisions have thoroughly disapproved the
reasoning of Evans. Evans involved a federal income tax levied under a 1919
statute on the salary of a federal judge appointed in 1899 (see 253 U.S.
at 246), but the Court's opinion did not limit its holding to situations
in which the judge's appointment predated the imposition of the tax. Nor
did the decision in Evans rely on a perception that the unconstitutional
diminution was the effective reduction in judicial pay from the gross amount
before the taxing act was passed to the amount net of taxes after the tax
became effective. Rather, the rationale of Evans was that, under the Compensation
Clause, Congress must not interfere with the ability of Article III judges
to retain the full amount stated in law to be their salary, and may not
indirectly diminish that amount by subjecting it to any tax at all. As the
Court stated, &quot;all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold
or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by law for
his services must be regarded as within the prohibition.&quot; Id. at 254.</P>

<P>In reaching that conclusion, the Court in Evans relied (253 U.S. at 255)
on intergovernmental tax immunity cases such as Dobbins v. Commissioners
of Erie County, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 435 (1842), Collector v. Day, 78 U.S.
(11 Wall.) 113 (1871), and Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., 157
U.S. 429 (1895), for the broad proposition that the Framers &quot;were so
sedulously bent on securing the independence of the judiciary [that they]
intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution
in the name and form of a tax[.]&quot; Evans, 253 U.S. at 256. The Court
likened judicial immunity from income taxes to the intergovernmental tax
immunity cases because, it perceived, both principles of immunity were necessary
to preserve &quot;independence&quot; (id. at 255) in the face of the power
to tax, which &quot;carries with it the power to embarrass and destroy&quot;
(id. at 256) (internal quotation marks omitted). On that premise, the Court
concluded that a judge's &quot;compensation is protected from diminution
in any form, whether by a tax or otherwise, and is assured to him in its
entirety for his support.&quot; Id. at 263.</P>

<P>Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis, dissented. They maintained
that the inclusion of judicial salaries in the incidence of an income tax
is constitutional as long as that tax does not single out judicial compensation
but, rather, applies with like force to all citizens. Justice Holmes argued
that the constitutional imperative of protecting judicial independence &quot;is
a very good reason for preventing attempts to deal with a judge's salary
as such, but seems to me no reason for exonerating him from the ordinary
duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others.&quot; 253 U.S. at
265. &quot;To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to
pay,&quot; he continued, &quot;cannot possibly be made an instrument to
attack his independence as a judge. I see nothing in the purpose of this
clause of the Constitution to indicate that the judges were to be a privileged
class, free from bearing their share of the cost of the institutions upon
which their well-being if not their life depends.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>The Court's reasoning and holding in Evans were reaffirmed in Miles v.
Graham, 268 U.S. 501 (1925). In Miles, the Court held that &quot;the plain
rule of Evans v. Gore&quot; required invalidation of the income tax as applied
to the salary of a judge who took office after the income tax was extended
to judicial salaries. Id. at 509. The Court stated in Miles that the Compensation
Clause &quot;impose[s] upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what
sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times
for payment. When this duty has been complied with, the amount specified
becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his
continuance in office.&quot; Id. at 508-509. The Court therefore found no
distinction between judges who took office before the taxing act was enacted
and those who took office after that date.</P>

<P>b. The Court's decisions in Evans and Miles exempting judges from income
taxes were immediately and forcefully criticized by state courts, courts
in other English-speaking countries interpreting similar provisions, and
academic commentary.11 In O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939), the
Court, acknowledging much of that criticism (see id. at 281 nn. 6-8), reconsidered
its view of the limitations imposed by the Compensation Clause upon Congress's
power to tax, and adopted Justice Holmes's understanding that judicial salaries
are as much subject to taxation as the salaries of other citizens. The Court
held in O'Malley that &quot;a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net
income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution
of his salary within the prohibition&quot; of the Constitution. Id. at 282.</P>

<P>O'Malley expressly overruled Miles. 307 U.S. at 282-283. O'Malley did
not expressly overrule Evans, for Congress had structured the income tax
act under review in O'Malley &quot;to avoid, at least in part, the consequences
of&quot; Evans by making the tax applicable only to the salaries of judges
appointed after its effective date. See id. at 280. But the Court plainly
adopted the understanding of the Compensation Clause set forth in Justice
Holmes's dissent in Evans, that the Clause does not insulate judges from
sharing with others the ordinary burdens of citizenship. &quot;[J]udges
are also citizens,&quot; the Court explained, and &quot;their particular
function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their
fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose Constitution
and laws they are charged with administering.&quot; Id. at 282.</P>

<P>The Court reexamined O'Malley, Miles, and Evans in United States v. Will,
449 U.S. 200 (1980). In Will, the Court held that Congress may not withdraw
an increase in statutory judicial salaries once it has gone into effect,
but that Congress may cancel a prospective statutory salary increase before
it takes effect. The Court held that even a nondiscriminatory diminution
of statutory judicial salaries (along with other government employees' salaries)
violates the Compensation Clause. Id. at 226. In so holding, however, it
distinguished the case of taxation of judicial salaries, and reaffirmed
its holding in O'Malley that nondiscriminatory taxation of judicial salaries
does not violate the Clause because &quot;[f]ederal judges, like all citizens,
must share the material burden of the government.&quot; Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court in Will also disapproved the district
court's reliance on Evans as a basis for holding that the rescission of
a salary increase before its effective date reduces the amount of compensation that a judge has been promised. See
id. at 227. Rather, the Court stated:</P>

<P>In O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939), this Court held that the
immunity in the Compensation Clause would not extend to exempting judges
from paying taxes, a duty shared by all citizens. The Court thus recognized
that the Compensation Clause does not forbid everything that might adversely
affect judges. The opinion concluded by saying that to the extent Miles
v. Graham, 268 U.S. 501 (1925), was inconsistent, it &quot;cannot survive.&quot;
307 U.S. at 282-283. Because Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O'Malley must
also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.</P>

<P>Id. at 227 n.31.</P>

<P>c. Not only has the Court adopted the position of Justice Holmes's dissent
in Evans, that federal judges are not constitutionally immune from paying
&quot;the taxes that all other men have to pay,&quot; 253 U.S. at 265, but
it has expressly repudiated the intergovernmental tax immunity decisions
on which Evans heavily relied (see p. 19, supra). See South Carolina v.
Baker, 485 U.S. 505, 520, 524 (1988) (overruling Pollock v. Farmers' Loan
&amp; Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429 (1895)); Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe,
306 U.S. 466, 486 (1939) (overruling Collector v. Day, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.)
113 (1871)); see also Jefferson County v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423, 436-437 (1999);
Davis v. Michigan Dep't of the Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 811 (1989) (noting
overruling of &quot;Dobbins-Day&quot; line of cases).</P>

<P>In particular, in Graves, decided the same Term as O'Malley, the Court
emphasized that the proper purpose of a limited intergovernmental tax immunity-such
as that recognized in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819)-is
&quot;not to confer benefits on [government] employees by relieving them
from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government,
whose benefits they enjoy, * * * but to prevent undue interference with
one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.&quot; 306
U.S. at 483-484. The Court held in Graves that a nondiscriminatory state
income tax that falls on federal employees as well as others does not &quot;impose
a burden on the national government tantamount to an interference by one
government with the other in the performance of its functions.&quot; Id.
at 480-481. And as Justice Frankfurter stressed in his concurring opinion
in Graves, subjecting individual government officials to nondiscriminatory
income taxation does not imperil the independence of the institutions for
which those officials work; the flaw of the broader intergovernmental tax
immunity doctrine recognized in cases such as Collector v. Day was that
&quot;[f]ailure to exempt public functionaries from the universal duties
of citizenship to pay for the costs of government was hypothetically transmuted
into hostile action of one government against the other.&quot; Id. at 490.
Evans suffered from the same flaw in reasoning: it erroneously transmuted Congress's failure
to exempt federal judges from the general income tax into a danger to the
independence of the institution of the federal judiciary.</P>

<P>d. Evans also claimed support in state court decisions interpreting similar
state constitutional provisions (253 U.S. at 256), a private letter from
Chief Justice Taney to Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase (id. at 257), and
an opinion of Attorney General Hoar (id. at 258). Closer examination reveals
that those sources lend Evans little support.</P>

<P>(i) The weight of state court cases supports Justice Holmes's position
that a constitutional prohibition against diminution of judicial salaries
does not grant judges immunity from generally applicable, nondiscriminatory
taxes. In the first such state case of which we are aware, Commissioners
of Northumberland County v. Chapman, 2 Rawle 73 (Pa. 1829), the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court ruled that that State's 1790 constitution, which provided
that the compensation of the judges of the courts of common pleas &quot;shall
not be diminished during their continuance in office,&quot; Pa. Const. of
1790, Art. 5, &sect; 2, was not violated by the application to a judge of
a tax on &quot;all offices and posts of profit.&quot; Chapman, 2 Rawle at
73, 77. The court explained that &quot;there is no reason to exempt a judge
from contribution,&quot; and that, although the legislature &quot;could
not constitutionally retrench a part of a judge's salary under the pretext
of assessing a tax on it,&quot; for the &quot;bona fide purpose of contribution,
a reasonable portion of it, like any other part of his property, may be
applied to the public exigencies.&quot; Id. at 77. At least five other state
supreme courts subsequently upheld the application of income taxes to state
judges' salaries against similar constitutional objection. While the reasoning
of the decisions varies somewhat, all of them rejected or expressed strong
doubt about the proposition that a protection against diminution of salary
grants judges an immunity from the duty to pay taxes that are imposed on
other citizens generally.12</P>

<P>A few state court decisions did invalidate certain taxes as applied to
judicial salaries, but those decisions are of uncertain weight at best.13
Only the North Carolina Supreme Court, in Long v. Watts, 110 S.E. 765 (1922),
definitively invalidated the application of a general state income tax to
judicial salaries, but that decision has little persuasive force in interpreting
the federal Constitution because the court expressly stated that its reasoning
exempted from taxation judges who took office after the tax statute was
enacted (id. at 771)-precisely the holding of Miles that this Court overruled
in O'Malley.</P>

<P>(ii) The Court observed in O'Malley (307 U.S. at 281 &amp; nn. 6, 8)
that &quot;English-speaking courts&quot; abroad interpreting similar prohibitions
against diminution of judicial salaries rejected the reasoning of Evans
as authority for construing those restrictions to prohibit the application
of income taxes on judicial pay. See Krause v. Commissioner for Inland Revenue,
1929 A.D. 286 (S. Afr.); The Judges v. Attorney-General for Saskatchewan,
53 Times L.R. 464 (P.C. 1937); see also Cooper v. Commissioner of Income
Tax for Queensland, (1907) 4 C.L.R. 1304 (Austl.). Those tribunals rejected
the view taken in Evans that the application of a general tax to judicial
salaries threatens judicial independence. As Justice Barton of the High
Court of Australia observed in Cooper, &quot;[o]ne does not think of a Colonial
Treasurer trying to levy a tax on the whole people, yielding many hundreds
of thousands of pounds, for the mere purpose of vindictively obtaining a
few pounds from one or half a dozen Judges.&quot; Id. at 1319-1320. Similarly,
Justice Stratford of the South African Appellate Division observed in Krause
that &quot;[i]t is indeed difficult to appreciate in what manner a judge's
independence of action is attacked by having to contribute, with all other
citizens * * * , towards the maintenance of good order and government of
the State in which he lives.&quot; 1929 A.D. at 295.</P>

<P>Justice Stratford also forcefully rejected Evans' assumption &quot;that
income tax has the 'effect' of diminishing the salary.&quot; Krause, 1929
A.D. at 295-296.14 Similarly, in Cooper, Justice O'Connor concluded that
the &quot;ordinary sense&quot; of the prohibition against diminution of
judicial compensation did not prohibit the application of income taxes to
such salaries as long as &quot;the full amount of statutory salary has been
paid [to the judge] by the Government,&quot; and he rejected the argument
that under the prohibition a judge &quot;is entitled to have his salary
exempted from any general scheme of taxation of incomes.&quot; 4 C.L.R.
at 1323.</P>

<P>(iii) In Evans, the Court noted that, after passage of the income tax
act of 1862, Chief Justice Taney wrote to Secretary Chase, objecting on
constitutional grounds to the application of the tax to judicial salaries.
253 U.S. at 257-258; see 157 U.S. 701-703 (reprinting Taney letter). As
the Court subsequently observed in O'Malley, however, in doing so Chief
Justice Taney &quot;merely gave his extra-judicial opinion, asserting at
the same time that the question could not be adjudicated.&quot; 307 U.S.
at 280. Chief Justice Taney, moreover, simply asserted that the tax act
&quot;diminishes the compensation of every judge three per cent, and if
it can be diminished to that extent by the name of a tax, it may in the
same way be reduced from time to time at the pleasure of the legislature.&quot;
157 U.S. at 701. He did not consider the forceful point that a legislature
is unlikely to enact a generally applicable tax for the purpose of threatening
judicial independence.</P>

<P>Evans also stated (253 U.S. at 258) that in 1869, Attorney General Hoar
adopted Chief Justice Taney's position that the income tax could not be
constitutionally applied to the salaries of Article III judges or the President.15
See 13 Op. Att'y Gen. 161, 161-164 (1869). But that opinion, like Evans,
relied squarely (id. at 162) on this Court's intergovernmental tax immunity
decision in Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 435
(1842) which has since been overruled. See pp. 19, 22-23. A more sound approach
to the question is set forth in a 1919 opinion of Attorney General Palmer,
see 31 Op. Att'y Gen. 475, 475-489 (not cited in Evans), which concluded
that the Compensation Clause &quot;protect[s] the salaries which [judges]
shall receive, but [does] not, in any way, limit the power of Congress to
create tax burdens to be borne by all citizens alike.&quot; Id. at 484.</P>

<P>e. In sum, Evans has not withstood closer examination and the test of
time. Accordingly, that decision, and its reasoning which construes the
application of a nondiscriminatory income tax to judicial pay as an impermissible
diminution of the compensation that judges are due under Article III, should
be disapproved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. The Diminution Of Judicial Compensation Prohibited By Article III
Is A Reduction In Judges' Salary Stated In Law, Not A Decrease In Their
Effective Take-Home Pay Net Of Taxes</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The court of appeals in this case attempted to reconcile Evans and O'Malley
by reading Evans to hold that Congress may not impose new taxes on the salaries
of already sitting federal judges (even if those taxes do not discriminate
against judges), even though under O'Malley, &quot;nondiscriminatory taxation
of a judge who took office after the tax went into effect does not violate
the Compensation Clause.&quot; Pet. App. 64a (emphasis omitted). The court's
reasoning was that, in the former case, the already sitting judge's compensation
is &quot;diminish[ed]&quot; by the effect of the new tax, while in the latter
case, &quot;the taxation formed part of that judge's compensation scheme
from the outset of his tenure.&quot; Ibid. Respondents have advanced the
same interpretation of the Compensation Clause. See Br. in Opp. 17-20.</P>

<P>As we have explained (pp. 18-19, supra), this focus on taxation of the
compensation of sitting judges, as opposed to those appointed after the
taxing statute was enacted, was not part of the Court's rationale in Evans.
In any event, the interpretation of the Compensation Clause advanced by
respondents and reflected in the court of appeals' opinion is erroneous:
the Clause does not bar Congress from applying nondiscriminatory taxes to
the salaries of already sitting federal judges. Respondents do not argue
that Congress has ever literally diminished their stated salary.16 Respondents
argue, rather, that the undiminished &quot;Compensation&quot; that is guaranteed
to Article III judges is their take-home pay net of taxes, and so an increase
in taxes applicable to their salaries equals an &quot;effective&quot; diminution
of their compensation. The text of the Constitution and practicalities of
tax administration refute that contention, and the policies of the Clause
offer it no support.</P>

<P>a. First, respondents' construction suffers from serious textual flaws.
A major problem in respondents' argument is the relation between the Judges'
Compensation Clause and the President's Compensation Clause, Art. II, &sect;
1, Cl. 7, which provides that the President shall &quot;receive for his
Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished
during the Period for which he shall have been elected.&quot;17 (Emphasis
added.) Under respondents' theory, Congress could not eliminate any tax
on the President's salary while he was in office, even if that elimination
were applicable to all citizens, because such an action would &quot;encrease[]&quot;
the President's effective compensation net of taxes. We see no reason, however,
why the Constitution would require Congress to discriminate against the
President by denying him tax relief that it provides to all other individuals.18</P>

<P>Similarly, the Twenty-seventh Amendment provides that &quot;[n]o law,
varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives,
shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.&quot;
U.S. Const. Amend. XXVII.19 Under respondents' construction of &quot;Compensation&quot;
as &quot;compensation net of income taxes,&quot; Congress could not impose
new (or repeal old) taxes on its own Members' salaries until an election
of Representatives had intervened, even if it did so with respect to the
general population, because such an action would &quot;vary[] the compensation&quot;
of Senators and Representatives. Respondents' textual analysis therefore
leads to the conclusion that, when Congress imposes new income taxes on
the general population, it is constitutionally required to discriminate
in favor of itself by exempting its Members from those taxes. This implausible
result demonstrates that respondents' reading of the Compensation Clause
cannot be sustained.</P>

<P>b. Respondents' construction of Article III would also lead to serious
practical difficulties in tax administration. If respondents were correct
that &quot;Compensation&quot; in Article III means the effective take-home
pay net of income taxes, then it is difficult to understand why Congress
would not also be prohibited from raising the rates of income taxes on the
salaries of sitting judges.20 If the application of a new income tax to
judicial salaries would &quot;diminish&quot; a judge's compensation, so,
it would seem, would an increase in the rate of such an income tax. Either
action reduces the amount that the judge takes home in pay, even when the
judge's statutory salary remains unchanged. But that construction, if accepted,
would require Congress to apply differing income tax rates (and perhaps
differing deductions, exemptions, and credits) to judges, depending on the
date of their appointment. The application of such a system of income tax
to judicial salaries would be extraordinarily unwieldy.21</P>

<P>Respondents have maintained (Br. in Opp. 29) that there is a difference
of constitutional significance between a new income tax and an increased
income tax rate, but they do not explain why or how the Constitution could
distinguish between the two, if they are correct in their initial premise</P>

<P>that the imposition of a generally applicable tax constitutes a diminution
in a judge's compensation.22 Indeed, it is not clear that respondents can
distinguish Social Security taxes from the income tax on that basis, for
Social Security taxes on employees are merely a kind of income tax. See
26 U.S.C. 3101(a) and (b) (imposing OASDI and HI taxes &quot;on the income
of every individual&quot;). Moreover, Congress has frequently imposed surtaxes
on income that might be characterized either as a new income tax or an increase
in the rate of income taxes.23 Respondents' construction of the Compensation
Clause offers no guidance about the proper treatment of such taxes.</P>

<P>c. Respondents' submission also finds little support in the underlying
policies of the Compensation Clause. This Court has remarked that the Clause
has two objectives: to preserve the independence of the judiciary from &quot;potential
domination by other branches of government,&quot; Will, 449 U.S. at 218,
and to &quot;attract able lawyers to the bench&quot; by assuring them certain
support, id. at 221. It is difficult to conceive, however, how Congress's
extension of the generally applicable, nondiscriminatory OASDI and HI taxes
to judicial salaries-along with the salaries of numerous federal officials
and employees-could have posed any threat to judicial independence. Certainly
Congress is unlikely to establish a new, generally applicable tax on incomes
for the purpose (or with the likely effect) of endangering the independence
of the judiciary. See pp. 26-28, supra. Thus, if Congress had brought judges
within the Social Security system at the same time that it extended that
system to most wage-earners, there could have been no serious contention
that Congress was threatening judicial independence.24 That is particularly
true since Congress also extended to federal judges the opportunity to earn
credits for OASDI and HI benefits based on their judicial service, an opportunity
they had not previously had.</P>

<P>Respondents' argument, therefore, is that Congress could not do in two
steps what it could have done at one time-enact the Social Security system
first for private-sector employees, and then extend it to federal employees</P>

<P>as well. Thus, they contend, because Congress initially exempted judges
from OASDI and HI taxes, it was required to maintain that exemption permanently
for judges who were in office before the taxes were further extended. But,
as the Court of Federal Claims observed, there is &quot;no good reason why
Congress in taxing judges has the power to accomplish wholesale what it
cannot do piecemeal.&quot; Pet. App. 45a. Indeed, &quot;the purpose of the
Compensation Clause is not to make irrevocable every momentary tax exemption
enjoyed by sitting judges relative to the public; its purpose is rather
to protect the independence of the judicial branch by insuring that judges
are shielded from attempts by the political branches to impose economic
duress.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>Respondents argue, however (Br. in Opp. 20), that the extension of OASDI
and HI taxes to their judicial salaries made their judicial positions relatively
less attractive because, when they left the private sector, they expected
that their judicial salaries (unlike their private-sector salaries) would
be free of Social Security taxes. They maintain that the application of
new taxes in such a manner deters qualified persons from assuming judicial
positions. But respondents overlook the significant benefit that many sitting</P>

<P>and future judges obtained in 1983 and 1984 by becoming eligible for
OASDI and HI coverage based on their judicial service.25 Indeed, although
respondents have objected to the imposition of OASDI and HI taxes on their
salaries, they have never suggested that they would waive the right to receive
OASDI and HI benefits based on their coverage in judicial service in return
for exemption from OASDI and HI taxes. Moreover, respondents have pointed
to no evidence suggesting that the OASDI and HI taxes caused federal judges
to leave judicial service; indeed, they have not even alleged that any of
them left the bench because of those taxes.26</P>

<P>More fundamentally, whereas a prohibition against diminution in judges'
statutory salary may be necessary to assure them a reasonable certainty
of support, a prohibition against taxation is not. If the Constitution did
not prohibit Congress from reducing judges' statutory salaries, judges might
well fear that Congress would exercise its discretion over their salary
to reduce them to penury, without political objection from the general public.
But a judge who is assured of a certain statutory salary, as respondents
are, also knows that his rate of taxation will be no greater than that of
similarly situated members of the general public, and that the general public
will object to onerous income tax rates. Thus, while judges, like all members
of the public, are subject to income taxes, they also have, like all members
of the public, protection in the political system against excessively burdensome
income taxes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>B. Congress's Extension Of Social Security Taxes To Judicial Salaries
Did Not Impermissibly Discriminate Against Article III Judges</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Respondents have argued (Br. in Opp. 22-24) that Congress unconstitutionally
discriminated against federal judges when it extended Social Security taxes
to their salaries.27 That contention is without merit. When Congress extended
HI and OASDI taxes to the salaries of Article III judges and federal employees,
it merely brought taxation of those salaries in line with the treatment
of the vast majority of other wage-earners in this country.28</P>

<P>Respondents object (Br. in Opp. 23), however, that Congress did not also
require all federal employees who were already then in service to pay the
OASDI tax.29 Congress was aware, however, that most incumbent federal employees
were already required to make salary contributions to a separate retirement
system, the CSRS, which had been in place since 1920. See pp. 3, 6-7, supra.
Terminating CSRS immediately would have been extremely disruptive of federal
employees' retirement plans. On the other hand, requiring federal employees
to contribute to both Social Security and CSRS would have subjected those
employees to a mandatory double deduction under federal law. Congress therefore
allowed incumbent federal employees to remain in CSRS rather than the OASDI program and to receive a CSRS annuity (but
not OASDI benefits) based on their federal employment. In doing so, Congress
treated incumbent federal employees as equally as possible to all other
wage earners, who are also subject to only one imposition under federal
law for retirement income security, the OASDI tax. Federal judges, however,
were not subject to any similar civil-service retirement contribution, because
judges are guaranteed a lifetime annuity after retirement at taxpayer expense.
See 28 U.S.C. 371 (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998). Congress therefore had no
occasion to permit judges to &quot;opt out&quot; of the OASDI program.</P>

<P>Respondents also point out (Br. in Opp. 5-7) that, when Congress extended
OASDI taxes to judicial salaries, it allowed a small number of high-level
federal officials and employees to opt out of CSRS, thereby (respondents
contend) permitting those persons effectively to offset the incidence of
the new OASDI taxes on their salaries. But if Congress had required those
federal officials to continue contributing to both CSRS and the OASDI program,
they would have been subject to a double imposition. Moreover, Congress
did not allow those high-level officials and employees to opt out of OASDI;
it required them (like Article III judges) to pay OASDI taxes, and made
the second payment (the CSRS contribution) optional. Judges were not covered
by CSRS, and thus had no cause to complain of paying double retirement contributions.</P>

<P>There is therefore no basis for a conclusion that Congress impermissibly
discriminated against federal judges by bringing them within the coverage
of the OASDI program and requiring them to pay OASDI taxes. While it is
true that Congress in 1984 allowed other incumbent federal employees to
alleviate the effect of the extension of the OASDI tax to government employees'
salaries, that is only because those other employees were already required
under federal law to contribute to a program that, like OASDI, financed
a retirement income security program. Federal judges had not previously
been required to make contributions to such a program through salary contributions.
By declining to grant federal judges an exemption or setoff from OASDI taxes,
Congress did not discriminate against them; rather, it equalized, as nearly
as possible, the treatment of contributions from their salaries for retirement
income security purposes with that of all other employees, federal and otherwise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>II. ANY CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION TERMINATED WHEN CONGRESS INCREASED THE
STATUTORY SALARIES OF FEDERAL JUDGES IN AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE OASDI
AND HI TAXES DEDUCTED FROM THOSE SALARIES.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In 1984, after Congress extended OASDI taxes to judicial salaries, Congress
also granted federal judges an increase in salary that exceeded the amount
of those taxes. See Pet. App. 86a-87a; pp. 8, 11-12, supra. The Court of
Federal Claims concluded that that increase in judicial salaries terminated
any Compensation Clause violation caused by the taxes' diminution of judges'
take-home pay. Pet. App. 78a-89a. The court of appeals, however, held that
the unconstitutional diminution in judicial compensation continued even
after Congress elevated judges' effective take-home pay above its level
before the extension of Social Security taxes to judges' salaries. The court
of appeals analyzed the issue in terms of whether the salary increase was
sufficient to pay the &quot;damages&quot; caused by what it believed to
be an ongoing violation of the Compensation Clause resulting from the assessment
of OASDI and HI taxes each month, rather than whether the increase in salary
terminated the violation altogether. Viewing the matter from that perspective,
the court reasoned that the measure of damages for a Compensation Clause
violation is &quot;independent of any generally awarded adjustment to judicial
salaries.&quot; Pet. App. 125a. That ruling cannot be reconciled with the
text or policies of the Clause.</P>

<P>The Compensation Clause provides that federal judges shall &quot;receive
for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during
their Continuance in Office.&quot; Even if Congress had &quot;diminished&quot;
the compensation of sitting judges when it imposed HI and OASDI taxes on
their preexisting salaries, that &quot;diminution&quot; would have come
to an end when Congress raised those judges' salaries in an amount greater
than the amount of the taxes imposed on their pre-tax salaries. Congress
could be said to have &quot;diminished&quot; a judge's compensation only
if it left the judge with less compensation than he received before the
tax took effect. Cf. Will, 449 U.S. at 226-229 (holding that Congress did
not unconstitutionally diminish judges' salaries when it canceled salary
adjustments before their effective date). To be sure, the increase in the
respondents' net pay was smaller than it would have been if the HI and OASDI
taxes had not been withheld. But the Compensation Clause prohibits Congress only
from decreasing judicial compensation; Congress has discretion to decide
what increases in compensation should be given. See id. at 227.</P>

<P>The facts of this case are similar to the termination of the Compensation
Clause violation in &quot;Year 1&quot; of the facts of Will. In Year 1,
judges initially were granted a 4.8% annual salary increase for the fiscal
year, pursuant to a recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Federal
Pay and an Executive Order. Congress, however, enacted a statute rescinding
that increase, which the President signed on the first day of the fiscal
year, after the increase had taken effect. See 449 U.S. at 204-206, 224-225.
Although the Court found a Compensation Clause violation in that rescission
of the 4.8% salary increase, it also noted that Congress, later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutory increase in judges' salaries
that exceeded the salaries that judges would have received had Congress
left in effect the initial 4.8% increase. Id. at 206 n.3, 209 n.6. It was
unquestioned in Will that Congress's subsequent increase in judicial salaries
terminated the violation caused by the rescission of the 4.8% increase.
Ibid. The Court did not suggest that Congress was obligated to continue
to pay to the judges who held office at the beginning of Year 1 the rescinded
4.8% increase in addition to the subsequently enacted statutory increase-
yet that is essentially respondents' position here.</P>

<P>The court of appeals believed that the Compensation Clause violation
in this case continued independent of any general judicial salary increases
because, in its view, a different rule would create two classes of judges:
those appointed after the taxes were extended to judicial salaries, who
would enjoy the full extent of the general salary increases, and those appointed
before application of the taxes, who would be required to pay &quot;out
of their own salaries, including generally-granted increases, the damages
owed to them by the Government.&quot; Pet. App. 122a.30 But once Congress
increased judicial salaries above the level that existed before the incidence
of the tax, there was no more diminution and hence no more violation of
the Compensation Clause for which damages might be owed. Moreover, the court
of appeals' ruling itself created two classes of judges with different compensation
packages: federal judges appointed after the OASDI taxes took effect in
1984 must pay HI and OASDI taxes on their current annual salaries, whereas
judges appointed before that date receive a permanent immunity from paying
those taxes-even though they are eligible for HI and OASDI benefits based
on their judicial service. The court of appeals' decision therefore creates
inequities in judicial compensation.</P>

<P>The effect of the court of appeals' ruling on this point is that Congress
may never bring to an end a Compensation Clause violation caused by taxation
of judicial salaries except by repealing the offending tax (or, perhaps,
by granting the affected judges a special salary increase, thereby compensating
them differently from all other federal judges). That ruling casts a serious
cloud over Congress's authority to extend nondiscriminatory taxes paid by
the general population to judicial salaries; if Congress wished to do so,
it would have to grant sitting judges a permanent exemption from the tax.
That requirement would create inequities among Article III judges and would
embed those inequities in the judicial compensation system for long periods
of time, in view of the life tenure of Article III judges. Congress could,
of course, exempt all judges from new taxes, but that approach would create
inequity between Article III judges and all other citizens, as this Court
recognized in O'Malley, when it said that &quot;judges are also citizens&quot;
and do not have &quot;an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens
the material burden of the government whose Constitution and laws they are
charged with administering.&quot; 307 U.S. at 282. Accordingly, should the
Court conclude that the Compensation Clause was violated by Congress's extension
of OASDI and HI taxes to judicial salaries, it should also hold that the
violation was terminated when Congress subsequently increased judicial salaries
in an amount greater than the amount of the tax.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 2000</P>

<P>1 Eligibility for HI benefits, in general, is tied to eligibility for
Social Security old-age benefits. See 42 U.S.C. 426(a)(2)(A). Eligibility
for old-age benefits is based on an individual's having paid OASDI taxes
for 40 &quot;quarters of coverage.&quot; See 42 U.S.C. 402(a), 414(a)(2).
&quot;[Q]uarters of coverage&quot; is tied to payment of &quot;wages,&quot;
which is defined in terms of remuneration for &quot;employment.&quot; See
42 U.S.C. 409(a) (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998), 42 U.S.C. 413(a)(2)(A).</P>

<P>2 The taxes on employees' wages that finance in part the OASDI and HI
programs are imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3101(a) and (b). Both Sections impose
a tax on income equal to a percentage of the employee's wages with respect
to &quot;employment,&quot; as defined in 26 U.S.C. 3121(b) (1994 &amp; Supp.
IV 1998). Section 3121(b) and a companion provision, Section 3121(u), have
undergone several changes relevant to this case. Before September 3, 1982,
Section 3121(b) excluded from the definition of &quot;employment&quot; &quot;service
performed in the employ of the United States * * * if such service is covered by a retirement system established by
a law of the United States.&quot; 26 U.S.C. 3121(b)(6)(A) (1982). That provision
exempted Article III judges from the HI and OASDI taxes, because those judges
were (and are) covered by another retirement system established by 28 U.S.C.
371 (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998). That system permits a judge to retire from
service on an annuity equal to the judge's salary at the time of retirement.</P>

<P>Congress extended the HI tax to federal judges' salaries in the Tax Equity
and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Pub. L. No. 97-248, Tit.
II, Subtit. E, Pt. III, &sect; 278, 96 Stat. 559-563. TEFRA added a new
Section 3121(u)(1)(A), which provided that, &quot;[f]or purposes of the
[Medicare hospital insurance tax] imposed by section 3101(b) * * * paragraph
(6) of [26 U.S.C. 3121(b)] shall be applied without regard to subparagraph[]
(A) * * * thereof.&quot; 26 U.S.C. 3121(u)(1)(A) (1982); see Pub. L. No.
97-249, &sect; 278, 96 Stat. 559. That provision of TEFRA, in effect, instructed
that the exclusion of federal judges' salaries from the definition of &quot;employment&quot;
should be disregarded for purposes of the HI tax, and thus extended that
tax (but not the OASDI tax) to judges' salaries. That provision of TEFRA
also effectively extended the HI tax, but not the OASDI tax, to the salaries
of federal employees who were covered by the CSRS.</P>

<P>Congress extended the OASDI tax to federal judges' (and other federal
employees') salaries in the Social Security Amendments of 1983, Pub. L.
No. 98-21, &sect; 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 69, which again amended 26 U.S.C.
3121. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 redefined &quot;employment&quot;
in Section 3121(b)(5) generally to exclude &quot;service performed in the
employ of the United States,&quot; but also excluded from that exclusion
service performed by federal judges, among others. See Pub. L. No. 98-21,</P>

<P>&sect; 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 70. In addition, the Social Security Amendments
of 1983 amended Section 3121(u) to provide that, for the purpose of the
Medicare tax, Section 3121(b) &quot;shall be applied without regard to paragraph
(5) thereof.&quot; See Pub. L. No. 98-21, &sect; 101(b)(2), 97 Stat. 70.
Because the Social Security Amendments of 1983 excluded service by federal
judges from the federal-employment exclusion from the general definition
of &quot;employment,&quot; it subjected federal judges to the HI and OASDI
taxes of Section 3101, which falls on the income of all wage-earners in
respect of their employment, unless excluded. Because the same Act directed
that the exclusion of federal employees in Section 3121(b)(5) be disregarded
for HI tax purposes, it again brought federal employees, including judges,
within the coverage of the HI tax.</P>

<P>3 Congress also permitted a small number of high-level federal officials
subject to the OASDI tax to opt out of CSRS. That option was afforded because,
otherwise, those officials would have been subject to a mandatory double
contribution for retirement income security purposes. Congress did not permit
those officials to opt out of Social Security taxes; it instead required
them, like judges, to pay OASDI taxes but made the contribution to CSRS
optional for those officials. See J.A. 64-65.</P>

<P>4 Those eight judges were District Judges Hatter, Arceneaux, Beer, Burciaga,
McNamara, Ramirez, and Wiseman, and Circuit Judge Pregerson. District Judges
Bowen and Roettger were also plaintiffs in the original suit, but did not
appeal from the adverse decision of the Claims Court dismissing the case
on jurisdictional grounds. J.A. 24-25; Pet. App. 19a. After the court of
appeals reversed that dismissal and remanded, Judges Bowen and Roettger
rejoined the lawsuit, when several other judges also became plaintiffs.
See id. at 75a n.5. For statute of limitations purposes, Judges Bowen and
Roettger were grouped with the &quot;later-filing judges.&quot; See pp.
9-10, infra.</P>

<P>5 The Compensation Clause provides: &quot;The Judges, both of the supreme
and inferior Courts, * * * shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services,
a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in
Office.&quot; 6 From December 17, 1982, to December 31, 1983, just before Congress
extended the OASDI tax to federal judges, circuit judges were paid an annual
salary of $77,300, and district judges were paid an annual salary of $73,100.
See Exec. Order No. 12,387, 47 Fed. Reg. 44,981, 44,988 (1982). In 1984,
after OASDI taxes were first imposed upon judges, the annual salaries of
circuit judges were raised to $80,400, and those of district judges were
raised to $76,000. Exec. Order No. 12,456, 49 Fed. Reg. 347, 360 (1983),
as amended by Exec. Order No. 12,477, 49 Fed. Reg. 22,041, 22,052 (1984),
and Exec. Order No. 12,487, 49 Fed. Reg. 36,493 (1984). Although the Executive
Order increasing judges' salaries in 1984 was promulgated on September 1,
1984, the increase in judges' salaries was made retroactive to the first
date of the first applicable pay period commencing on January 1, 1984. Ibid.;
see Pet. App. 86a.</P>

<P>Since that time, federal judges have received additional salary increases.
Circuit judges currently receive $149,900 annually, and district judges
receive $141,300. See Exec. Order No. 13,144, 64 Fed. Reg. 72,242 (1999);
see generally 28 U.S.C. 44 and 135 (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998), Historical
Notes (describing salary increases from 1919 for circuit judges and district
judges, respectively).</P>

<P>7 The Claims Court dismissed the suit on the ground that respondents
had not filed administrative tax-refund claims. Pet. App. 12a-18a. The court
of appeals ruled, however, that respondents were not required to file refund
claims because one of the counts of their complaint &quot;did not pursue
a tax refund. Instead they sought damages for violation of Article III, sect; 1-an action which is within the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the
Claims Court.&quot; Id. at 26a.</P>

<P>8 The eight new plaintiffs were, in addition to District Judges Bowen
and Roettger (who rejoined the case after the remand, see p. 7 n.4, supra),
District Judges Evans, Mentz, Owens, Wilhoit, Baker, and Mihm. J.A. 31.</P>

<P>9 With respect to the statute of limitations, the court held that the
HI claims and all the claims of the later-filing judges were filed more
than six years after those claims had accrued, and rejected respondents'
arguments that those claims were timely filed under the &quot;continuing
claim&quot; doctrine. Pet. App. 101a-105a. The court questioned whether
the continuing claim doctrine still exists at all, see id. at 103a, but
it also concluded that that doctrine does not apply to this case, where
&quot;the unlawful diminution consisted of imposition of two new taxes on
specific effective dates,&quot; id. at 105a. Those dates (January 1, 1983
and January 1, 1984), the court held, were the dates on which respondents'
claims accrued.</P>

<P>10 The en banc court relied for that conclusion on the &quot;continuing
claim&quot; doctrine, under which a claim accrues anew each time the government
incurs an alleged obligation to make a payment to the claimant. The court
reasoned that, because (in its view) each deduction of OASDI tax from a
judge's salary payment continued the Compensation Clause violation, a new
claim based on the Clause accrued each time such a deduction was made. See
Pet. App. 4a-8a.</P>

<P>12 See du Pont v. Green, 195 A. 273, 276 (Del. 1937) (noting that &quot;we
express a preference for the dissenting views in Evans v. Gore, as delivered
by Mr. Justice Holmes and concurred in by Justice Brandeis,&quot; that there
is &quot;no attack on the independence of a Judge by requiring him to pay
a tax that all other men had to pay, regardless of their rank or station&quot;);

equivalent to the Compensation Clause &quot;is one of the checks and restraints
imposed to secure the independence of the judiciary. It is not a tax exemption
provision.&quot;); see also State ex rel. Wickham v. Nygaard, 150 N.W. 513,
515 (Wis. 1915) (remarking that the proposition &quot;[t]hat the framers
of our Constitution intended to exempt public officers from any part of
the burden of taxation which might be imposed generally on the body of the
taxpayers of the state for the support of the government and the benefit
of the public, including the office holders, may well be doubted&quot;);
Poorman v. State Bd. of Equalization, 45 P.2d 307, 312-315 (Mont. 1935)
(&quot;[I]t is idle to say that because of this prohibition [against diminution
of salaries] an official can refuse to pay any species of tax whatever from
his acquisitions by way of salary&quot;; expressing preference for dissent
in Evans and reasoning of Taylor and Wickham, supra); Martin v. Wofford,
107 S.W. 2d 267, 271 (Ky. 1937) (observing that &quot;[t]he Constitution
deals with [public officials'] compensation as compensations and not as
exemptions of public officials from any tax that is levied on any other
citizen&quot;).</P>

<P>13 In Commonwealth ex rel. Hepburn v. Mann, 5 Watts &amp; Serg. 403 (1843),
a decision noted in Evans (253 U.S. at 256), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
invalidated under that State's 1838 constitution an income tax imposed solely
on salaries of state officials (see 5 Watts &amp; Serg. at 405), not a generally
applicable income tax. The effect of that decision was, moreover, repudiated
when Pennsylvania amended its constitution in 1873 to delete the prohibition
against diminution of judicial salaries. See Pa. Const. of 1873, Art. 5,
&sect; 18; see also Pa. Const. Art. 5, &sect; 16 (currently permitting nondiscriminatory
diminution of judicial salaries). Similarly, the Maryland Court of Appeals,
relying on Evans and Miles, invalidated the application of the state income
tax to judicial salaries, see Gordy v. Dennis, 5 A.2d 69 (Md. 1939), but
that decision was repudiated the very next year, when Maryland amended its
constitution expressly to permit the imposition of a nondiscriminatory income
tax on judicial salaries, see Md. Const. Art. 3, &sect; 35A. The Louisiana
Supreme Court invalidated the City of New Orleans' attempt to tax the salary
of a state supreme court justice, see New Orleans v. Lea, 14 La. Ann. 197
(1859), but the nature of the tax in that case is not clear from the court's
summary decision. The Alabama Supreme Court, in an advisory opinion, stated
that a state occupation tax levied on the salaries of state and county officers
(not a generally applicable tax) would be invalid as applied to judicial
salaries. See In re Opinions of the Justices, 144 So. 111 (Ala. 1932).</P>

<P>14 Indeed, Justice Stratford remarked that, &quot;[b]ut for a decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States in Evans v. Gore I venture to
think that the idea would not readily occur to any judge.&quot; Krause,
1929 A.D. at 294-295 (citation omitted). Justice Stratford also observed
that judges' salaries had been &quot;very much lessened in value by the
[British] Imperial Government's action in departing from the gold standard,&quot;
and that the British Government's actions had therefore, &quot;in effect,
diminished&quot; judges' salaries, but he rejected the notion that the indirect
effect of the departure from the gold standard upon judicial pay amounted
to an improper diminution in judicial compensation; &quot;the judges suffered
with the rest of the community and it would be fantastic to think that their
independence was affected by the general financial policy of the Imperial
Government.&quot; Id. at 296. Justice Wessels, although not reaching the
question, stated that he &quot;very much doubt[ed]&quot; the proposition
that &quot;the income tax payable on a judge's salary is a diminution of
his remuneration.&quot; Id. at 290.</P>

<P>15 As discussed at pp. 30-31, infra, the Constitution prohibits any increase
or decrease in the compensation of the President during his term of office.
See U.S. Const. Art. II, &sect; 1, Cl. 7.</P>

<P>16 To the contrary, since 1984, Congress has enacted substantial salary
increases for federal judges. See p. 8 n.6, supra.</P>

<P>17 The background to the adoption of the Constitution confirms the similar
purpose of the two Clauses. Both were intended to ensure independence from
Congress. Compare The Federalist No. 73, at 441-442 (Alexander Hamilton)
(Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (because of the President's Compensation Clause,
the legislature &quot;can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon
his necessities, nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice&quot;)
with The Federalist No. 79, at 472 (Alexander Hamilton) (&quot;The remark
made in relation to the President is equally applicable here. In the general
course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power
over his will.&quot;). The principal difference is that the Constitution
permits increases in judicial salaries but not in the salary of the President
during his term of office. The Framers permitted increases in judicial compensation
in the discretion of Congress in part because of the possibility that inflation
might lessen the value of a judge's salary during his life tenure. The President's
compensation, by contrast, did not present that problem, because the President
is elected for only a four-year term. See id. at 473; Will, 449 U.S. at
219-220. It is notable, however, that the Framers did not require Congress
to raise judicial salaries to keep pace with inflation, even though they
plainly understood that a decline in the value of money could effectively
diminish the buying power of a judge's salary. See Atkins v. United States,
556 F.2d 1028, 1047-1051 (Ct. Cl. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1009 (1978).
That point casts significant doubt on respondents' theory that the &quot;Compensation&quot;
protected from diminution by Article III is a judge's &quot;effective&quot;
compensation rather than the statutory salary payable to judges.</P>

<P>18 Attorney General Palmer noted this very point in his 1919 opinion,
observing that &quot;[i]f to impose an income tax is to diminish [the President's]
salary, to repeal a tax in force at the beginning of his term would equally
be to increase it.&quot; 31 Op. Att'y Gen. at 488. He further observed that,
if the Constitution indeed prohibited the imposition or repeal of generally
applicable taxes on the President's salary during his term of office, then
President Wilson was constitutionally required to continue to pay the tax
levied by the 1916 income tax act, even though &quot;that Act has since
been repealed and no one else in the country now pays the tax.&quot; Ibid.
The &quot;extreme improbability&quot; of such a result, he reasoned, supported
the conclusion that &quot;it was never intended that the amount which [the
President and Article III judges] should receive as compensation should
be regarded as affected in any way by the amount of income taxes imposed
upon them, in common with other citizens, either before or during their
terms of office.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>19 The Twenty-seventh Amendment, which became effective in 1992, was
proposed to the States by the First Congress and was first introduced in
the House of Representatives by James Madison, who obviously was familiar
with the Framers' understanding of the term &quot;Compensation&quot; as
used in the Constitution. See 1 Debates and Proceedings in the Congress
of the United States 448, 450, 452, 457, 756-757 (Joseph Gales comp., 1789).</P>

<P>20 Because Congress is also prohibited from adjusting the compensation
of the President and Members of Congress during the terms of office of the
President or of Representatives, respectively (see pp. 29-31, supra), Congress
might also be prohibited from raising or lowering the rates of income taxes
on the salaries of the President and all Members of Congress, even as part
of a general increase or decrease in tax rates.</P>

<P>21 Under such a rule, Congress would essentially be required (a) to freeze
the effective rate of any tax applicable to judicial salaries to the effective
rate in force when each judge received the judicial commission, (b) to subject
all federal judicial salaries only to the lowest effective income tax rate
that was applicable when any sitting member of the judiciary first took
office, or (c) to exempt federal judges from income taxes altogether (and
to do so permanently, since any new application of an income tax to judicial
salaries would violate the Compensation Clause as to sitting judges and
would create the problems just discussed for judges appointed in the future).
In addition, no change in tax rates could be applied to the salaries of
the President and Members of Congress until a new election for President
or for Representatives, respectively. Nothing in the text or background
of the Compensation Clause remotely suggests that the Framers intended to
relegate Congress to such a welter.</P>

<P>22 Respondents may suggest that a judge who takes office after an income
tax has been enacted is effectively on notice that Congress may subsequently
increase the rate of that tax. But it is also true that judges, like all
citizens, are on notice that Congress may impose new forms of taxes on income,
given that such taxes are specifically authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment.
That point distinguishes this case from Evans, because Judge Evans took
office during a period in which the income tax was deemed unconstitutional.
See Jefferson County v. Acker, 210 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2000), petition
for cert. pending, No. 00-455.</P>

<P>23 See, e.g., War Revenue Act, ch. 63, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 40 Stat. 300-301;
Revenue Act of 1918, ch. 18, &sect; 211, 40 Stat. 1062-1064 (1919); Revenue
Act of 1942, ch. 619, &sect; 172(a), 56 Stat. 884; Revenue Act of 1951,
ch. 521, 65 Stat. 459-461; Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968,
Pub. L. No. 90-364,</P>

<P>&sect; 102, 82 Stat. 251-254.</P>

<P>24 It is likely that political constraints on the imposition of taxes
on the population at large effectively prevent Congress from using generally
applicable, nondiscriminatory taxes to impair the independence of the judiciary.
Any generally applicable income tax affects a very large number of people,
and so the general public is likely to object to an onerous tax imposed
for the purpose of punishing a small number of judges. The same political
constraints, however, might not constrain Congress's power to fix the statutory
salary of judges, in the absence of the Compensation Clause, since that
power affects only a small number of individuals and not the general public.
Indeed, reductions in judges' statutory salary might well escape general
public notice.</P>

<P>25 The eligibility for HI coverage is particularly significant, because,
unlike OASDI benefits, HI benefits do not depend on the amount that an employee
has earned or the length of time he or she has worked, as long as the employee
has accrued sufficient quarters of coverage. Any employee has sufficient
quarters of coverage is entitled to the full range of HI benefits available
under the law.</P>

<P>26 Cf. Atkins, 556 F.2d at 1055 (rejecting argument that Congress's failure
to increase judicial salaries to match inflation violated Compensation Clause,
absent a &quot;demonstration of massive resignation for financial reasons&quot;).</P>

<P>27 Although we have argued that the application of nondiscriminatory
income taxes to judicial salaries does not violate the Compensation Clause
because the Constitution's reference to &quot;Compensation&quot; is only
to judges' stated salary, we assume that discriminatory taxation of judges
would contravene fundamental principles underlying Article III, if not the
Clause itself.</P>

<P>28 Respondents have noted (Br. in Opp. 22) that a small minority of wage-earners
still remain outside the Social Security system. See generally 26 U.S.C.
3121(b) (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998) (setting forth various exceptions to
coverage, including such persons as Bahamian temporary agricultural workers,
student nurses, and teenagers delivering newspapers). In addition, Congress
originally did not compel the participation of employees of state and local
governments in the OASDI program, out of concern about the intergovernmental
tax immunity doctrine and recognition that some state and local governments
operate retirement programs similar to CSRS. In 1950, Congress established
a system whereby state and local governments could elect to have certain
of their employees covered by the OASDI program under agreements with the
federal government. See Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41, 44-46 (1986); 42 U.S.C. 418; Social Security Act
Amendments of 1950, ch. 809, &sect; 106, 64 Stat. 514. In 1986, Congress
required HI coverage of almost all new employees of state and local governments.
See Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. No.
99-272, &sect; 13205, 100 Stat. 313-318 (1986). And in 1990, Congress required
OASDI coverage of essentially all employees of state and local governments
who are not covered by a state retirement system similar to CSRS or who
are not covered by OASDI pursuant to an agreement under 42 U.S.C. 418. See
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, &sect; 11332(b),
104 Stat. 1388-469; 26 U.S.C. 3121(b)(7)(F). The great majority of state
and local employees are now covered by the OASDI and HI programs. See H.R.
Rep. No. 25, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 17-19 (1983).</P>

<P>Although about 10% of the civilian labor force remains outside the OASDI
system, that hardly establishes that the imposition of Social Security taxes
on judges' salaries is discriminatory. The taxes are surely generally applicable
to most citizens, even if they are not universally applicable to all persons
employed in the United States.</P>

<P>29 Respondents' discrimination argument does not apply to the HI tax,
because all federal civilian employees were required to pay that tax after
January 1, 1983. J.A. 61. Most employees of state and local governments
have also been required to pay HI taxes since 1986. See 26 U.S.C. 3121(u)(2)(A);
S. Rep. No. 146, 99th Cong. 1st Sess. 389-391 (1985); H.R. Rep. No. 241,
99th Cong., 1st Sess. Pt. 1, at 25-27 (1985).</P>

<P>30 The same, of course, could have been said of Year 1 in Will. Judges
who were appointed in the six months between the date on which Congress
rescinded the 4.8% increase and that on which it enacted the statutory increase
would have received the &quot;full benefit&quot; of the statutory increase,
whereas judges who were in office before the 4.8% increase was rescinded
would not. Yet the Court did not doubt that the constitutional violation
terminated when the statutory increase was enacted.
