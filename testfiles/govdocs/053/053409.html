              </EM>To you, men and women who have come here to this great city 
              of this great State formally to launch a new party, a party of the 
              people of the whole Union, the National Progressive Party, I extend 
              my hearty greeting. You are taking a bold and a greatly needed step 
              for the service of our beloved country. The old parties are husks, 
              with no real soul within either, divided on artificial lines, boss-ridden 
              and privilege-controlled, each a jumble of incongruous elements, 
              and neither daring to speak out wisely and fearlessly what should 
              be said on the vital issues of the day. This new movement is a movement 
              of truth, sincerity, and wisdom, a movement which proposes to put 
              at the service of all our people the collective power of the people, 
              through their Governmental agencies, alike in the Nation and in 
              the several States. We propose boldly to face the real and great 
              questions of the day, and not skillfully to evade them as do the 
              old parties. We propose to raise aloft a standard to which all honest 
              men can repair, and under which all can fight, no matter what their 
              past political differences, if they are content to face the future 
              and no longer to dwell among the dead issues of the past. We propose 
              to put forth a platform which shall not be a platform of the ordinary 
              and insincere kind, but shall be a contract with the people; and, 
              if the people accept this contract by putting us in power, we shall 
              hold ourselves under honorable obligation to fulfill every promise 
              it contains as loyally as if it were actually enforceable under 
              the penalties of the law.</P>
            <P> <BR>
              <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">NO HOPE FROM THE OLD PARTY MACHINES</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>The prime need today is to face the fact that we are now in the 
              midst of a great economic evolution. There is urgent necessity of 
              applying both common sense and the highest ethical standard to this 
              movement for better economic conditions among the mass of our people 
              if we are to make it one of healthy evolution and not one of revolution. 
              It is, from the standpoint of our country, wicked as well as foolish 
              longer to refuse to face the real issues of the day. Only by so 
              facing them can we go forward; and to do this we must break up the 
              old party organizations and obliterate the old cleavage lines on 
              the dead issues inherited from fifty years ago. Our fight is a fundamental 
              fight against both of the old corrupt party machines, for both are 
              under the dominion of the plunder league of the professional politicians 
              who are controlled and sustained by the great beneficiaries of privilege 
              and reaction. How close is the alliance between the two machines 
              is shown by the attitude of that portion of those Northeastern newspapers, 
              including the majority of the great dailies in all the Northeastern 
              cities--Boston, Buffalo, Springfield, Hartford, Philadelphia, and, 
              above all, New York--which are controlled by or representative of 
              the interests which, in popular phrase, are conveniently grouped 
              together as the Wall Street interests. The large majority of these 
              papers supported Judge Parker for the Presidency in 1904; almost 
              unanimously they supported Mr. Taft for the Republican nomination 
              this year; the large majority are now supporting Professor Wilson 
              for the election. Some of them still prefer Mr. Taft to Mr. Wilson, 
              but all make either Mr. Taft or Mr. Wilson their first choice; and 
              one of the ludicrous features of the campaign is that those papers 
              supporting Professor Wilson show the most jealous partisanship for 
              Mr. Taft whenever they think his interests are jeopardized by the 
              Progressive movement-that, for instance, any Electors will obey 
              the will of the majority of the Republican voters at the primaries, 
              and vote for me instead of obeying the will of the Messrs. Barnes-Penrose-Guggenheim 
              combination by voting for Mr. Taft. No better proof can be given 
              than this of the fact that the fundamental concern of the privileged 
              interests is to beat the new party. Some of them would rather beat 
              it with Mr. Wilson; others would rather beat it with Mr. Taft; but 
              the difference between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taft they consider as 
              trivial, as a mere matter of personal preference. Their real fight 
              is for either, as against the Progressives. They represent the allied 
              Reactionaries of the country, and they are against the new party 
              because to their unerring vision it is evident that the real danger 
              to privilege comes from the new party, and from the new party alone. 
              The men who presided over the Baltimore and the Chicago Conventions, 
              and the great bosses who controlled the two Conventions, Mr. Root 
              and Mr. Parker, Mr. Barnes and Mr. Murphy, Mr. Penrose and Mr. Taggart, 
              Mr. Guggenheim and Mr. Sullivan, differ from one another of course 
              on certain points. But these are the differences which one corporation 
              lawyer has with another corporation lawyer when acting for different 
              corporations. They come together at once as against a common enemy 
              when the dominion of both is threatened by the supremacy of the 
              people of the United States, now aroused to the need of a National 
              alignment on the vital economic issues of this generation.</P>
            <P>Neither the Republican nor the Democratic platform contains the 
              slightest promise of approaching the great problems of today either 
              with understanding or good faith; and yet never was there greater 
              need in this Nation than now of understanding, and of action taken 
              in good faith, on the part of the men and the organizations shaping 
              our governmental policy. Moreover, our needs are such that there 
              should be coherent action among those responsible for the conduct 
              of National affairs and those responsible for the conduct of State 
              affairs; because our aim should be the same in both State and Nation; 
              that is, to use the Government as an efficient agency for the practical 
              betterment of social and economic conditions throughout this land. 
              There are other important things to be done, but this is the most 
              important thing. It is preposterous to leave a movement in the hands 
              of men who have broken their promises as have the present heads 
              of the Republican organization (not of the Republican voters, for 
              they in no shape represent the rank and file of Republican voters). 
              These men by their deeds give the lie to their words. There is no 
              health in them, and they cannot be trusted. But the Democratic party 
              is just as little to be trusted. The Underwood-Fitzgerald combination 
              in the House of Representatives has shown that it cannot safely 
              be trusted to maintain the interests of this country abroad or to 
              represent the interests of the plain people at home. The control 
              of the various State bosses in the State organizations has been 
              strengthened by the action at Baltimore; and scant indeed would 
              be the use of exchanging the whips of Messrs. Barnes, Penrose, and 
              Guggenheim for the scorpions of Messrs. Murphy, Taggart, and Sullivan. 
              Finally, the Democratic platform not only shows an utter failure 
              to understand either present conditions or the means of making these 
              conditions better, but also a reckless willingness to try to attract 
              various sections of the electorate by making mutually incompatible 
              promises which there is not the slightest intention of redeeming, 
              and which, if redeemed, would result in sheer ruin. Far-seeing patriots 
              should turn scornfully from men who seek power on a platform which 
              with exquisite nicety combines silly inability to understand the 
              National needs and dishonest insincerity in promising conflicting 
              and impossible remedies.</P>
            <P>If this country is really to go forward along the path of social 
              and economic justice, there must be a new party of Nationwide and 
              non-sectional principles, a party where the titular National chiefs 
              and the real State leaders shall be in genuine accord, a party in 
              whose counsels the people shall be supreme, a party that shall represent 
              in the Nation and the several States alike the same cause, the cause 
              of human rights and of governmental efficiency. At present both 
              the old parties are controlled by professional politicians in the 
              interests of the privileged classes, and apparently each has set 
              up as its ideal of business and political development a government 
              by financial despotism tempered by make-believe political assassination. 
              Democrat and Republican alike, they represent government of the 
              needy many by professional politicians in the interests of the rich 
              few. This is class government, and class government of a peculiarly 
              unwholesome kind.</P>
            <P> <BR>
              <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO RULE</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the time is ripe, and overripe, 
              for a genuine Progressive movement, Nationwide and justice-loving, 
              sprung from and responsible to the people themselves, and sundered 
              by a great gulf from both of the old party organizations, while 
              representing all that is best in the hopes, beliefs, and aspirations 
              of the plain people who make up the immense majority of the rank 
              and file of both the old parties.</P>
            <P>The first essential in the Progressive programme is the right of 
              the people to rule. But a few months ago our opponents were assuring 
              us with insincere clamor that it was absurd for us to talk about 
              desiring that the people should rule, because, as a matter of fact, 
              the people actually do rule. Since that time the actions of the 
              Chicago Convention, and to an only less degree of the Baltimore 
              Convention, have shown in striking fashion how little the people 
              do rule under our present conditions. We should provide by National 
              law for Presidential primaries. We should provide for the election 
              of United States Senators by popular vote. We should provide for 
              a short ballot; nothing makes it harder for the people to control 
              their public servants than to force them to vote for so many officials 
              that they cannot really keep track of any one of them, so that each 
              becomes indistinguishable in the crowd around him. There must be 
              stringent and efficient corrupt<EM> </EM>practices acts, applying 
              to the primaries as well as the elections; and there should be publicity 
              of campaign contributions during the campaign. We should provide 
              throughout this Union for giving the people in every State the real 
              right to rule themselves, and really and not nominally to control 
              their public servants and their agencies for doing the public business; 
              all incident of this being giving the people the right themselves 
              to do this public business if they find it impossible to get what 
              they desire through the existing agencies. I do not attempt to dogmatize 
              as to the machinery by which this end should be achieved. In each 
              community it must be shaped so as to correspond not merely with 
              the needs but with the customs and ways of thought of that community, 
              and no community has a right to dictate to any other in this matter. 
              But wherever representative government has in actual fact become 
              non-representative there the people should secure to themselves 
              the initiative, the referendum, and the recall, doing it in such 
              fashion as to make it evident that they do not intend to use these 
              instrumentalities wantonly or frequently, but to hold them ready 
              for use in order to correct the misdeeds or failures of the public 
              servants when it has become evident that these misdeeds and failures 
              cannot be corrected in ordinary and normal fashion. The administrative 
              officer should be given full power for otherwise he cannot do well 
              the people's work; and the people should be given full power over 
              him.</P>
            <P>I do not mean that we shall abandon representative government; 
              on the contrary, I mean that we shall devise methods by which our 
              Government shall become really representative. To use such measures 
              as the initiative, referendum, and recall indiscriminately and promiscuously 
              on all kinds of occasions would undoubtedly cause disaster; but 
              events have shown that at present our institutions are not representative--at 
              any rate in many States, and sometimes in the Nation--and that we 
              cannot wisely afford to let this condition of things remain longer 
              uncorrected. We have permitted the growing up of a breed of politicians 
              who, sometimes for improper political purposes, sometimes as a means 
              of serving the great special interests of privilege which stand 
              behind them, twist so-called representative institutions into a 
              means of thwarting instead of expressing the deliberate and well 
              thought-out judgment of the people as a whole. This cannot be permitted. 
              We choose our representatives for two purposes. In the first place, 
              we choose them with the desire that, as experts, they shall study 
              certain matters with which we, the people as a whole, cannot be 
              intimately acquainted, and that as regards these matters they shall 
              formulate a policy for our betterment. Even as regards such a policy, 
              and the actions taken thereunder, we ourselves should have the right 
              ultimately to vote our disapproval of it, if we feel such disapproval. 
              But, in the next place, our representatives are chosen to carry 
              out certain policies as to which we have definitely made up our 
              minds, and here we expect them to represent us by doing what we 
              have decided ought to be done. All I desire to do by securing more 
              direct control of the governmental agents and agencies of the people 
              is to give the people the chance to make their representatives really 
              represent them whenever the Government becomes mis-representative 
              instead of representative.</P>
            <P>I have not come to this way of thinking from closet study, or as 
              a mere matter of theory; I have been forced to it by a long experience 
              with the actual conditions of our political life. A few years ago, 
              for instance, there was very little demand in this country for Presidential 
              primaries. There would have been no demand now if the politicians 
              had really endeavored to carry out the will of the people as regards 
              nominations for President. But, largely under the influence of special 
              privilege in the business world, there have arisen castes of politicians 
              who not only do not represent the people, but who make their bread 
              and butter by thwarting the wishes of the people. This is true of 
              the bosses of both political parties in my own State of New York, 
              and it is just as true of the bosses of one or the other political 
              party in a great many States of the Union. The power of the people 
              must be made supreme within the several party organizations.</P>
            <P>In the contest which culminated six weeks ago in this city I speedily 
              found that my chance was at a minimum in any State where I could 
              not get an expression of the people themselves in the primaries. 
              I found that if I could appeal to the rank and file of the Republican 
              voters, I could generally win, whereas, if I had to appeal to the 
              political caste--which includes the most noisy defenders of the 
              old system--I generally lost. Moreover, I found, as a matter of 
              fact, not as a matter of theory, that these politicians habitually 
              and unhesitatingly resort to every species of mean swindling and 
              cheating in order to carry their point. It is because of the general 
              recognition of this fact that the words politics and politicians 
              have grown to have a sinister meaning throughout this country. The 
              bosses and their agents in the National Republican Convention at 
              Chicago treated political theft as a legitimate political weapon. 
              It is instructive to compare the votes of States where there were 
              open primaries and the votes of States where there were not. In 
              Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio we had direct primaries, and the 
              Taft machine was beaten two to one. Between and bordering on these 
              States were Michigan, Indiana, and Kentucky. In these States we 
              could not get direct primaries, and the politicians elected two 
              delegates to our one. In the first three States the contests were 
              absolutely open, absolutely honest. The rank and file expressed 
              their wishes, and there was no taint of fraud about what they did. 
              In the other three States the contest was marked by every species 
              of fraud and violence on the part of our opponents, and half the 
              Taft delegates in the Chicago Convention from these States had tainted 
              titles. The entire Wall Street press at this moment is vigorously 
              engaged in denouncing the direct primary system and upholding the 
              old convention system, or, as they call it, the &quot;old representative 
              system.&quot; They are so doing because they know that the bosses 
              and the powers of special privilege have tenfold the chance under 
              the convention system that they have when the rank and file of the 
              people can express themselves at the primaries. The nomination of 
              Mr. Taft at Chicago was a fraud upon the rank and file of the Republican 
              Party; it was obtained only by defrauding the rank and file of the 
              party of their right to express their choice; and such fraudulent 
              action does not bind a single honest member of the party.</P>
            <P>Well, what the National Committee and the fraudulent majority of 
              the National Convention did at Chicago in misrepresenting the people 
              has been done again and again in Congress, perhaps especially in 
              the Senate and in the State legislatures. Again and again laws demanded 
              by the people have been refused to the people because the representatives 
              of the people misrepresented them. Now my proposal is merely that 
              we shall give to the people the power, to be used not wantonly but 
              only in exceptional cases, themselves to see to it that the governmental 
              action taken in their name is really the action that they desire.</P>

            <P>The American people, and not the courts, are to determine their 
              own fundamental policies. The people should have power to deal with 
              the effect of the acts of all their governmental agencies. This 
              must be extended to include the effects of judicial acts as well 
              as the acts of the executive and legislative representatives of 
              the people. Where the<STRONG> </STRONG>judge merely does justice 
              as between man and man, not dealing with Constitutional questions, 
              then the interest of the public is only to see that he is a wise 
              and upright judge. Means should be devised for making it easier 
              than at present to get rid of an incompetent judge; means should 
              be devised by the bar and the bench acting in conjunction with the 
              various legislative bodies to make justice far more expeditious 
              and more certain than at present. The stick-in-the-bark legalism, 
              the legalism that subordinates equity to technicalities, should 
              be recognized as a potent enemy of justice. But this is not the 
              matter of most concern at the moment. Our prime concern is that 
              in dealing with the fundamental law of the land, in assuming finally 
              to interpret it, and therefore finally to make it, the acts of the 
              courts should be subject to and not above the final control of the 
              people as a whole. I deny that the American people have surrendered 
              to any set of men, no matter what their position or their character, 
              the final right to determine those fundamental questions upon which 
              free self-government ultimately depends. The people themselves must 
              be the ultimate makers of their own Constitution, and where their 
              agents differ in their interpretations of the Constitution the people 
              themselves should be given the chance, after full and deliberate 
              judgment, authoritatively to settle what interpretation it is that 
              their representatives shall thereafter adopt as binding.</P>
            <P>Whenever in our Constitutional system of government there exist 
              general prohibitions that, as interpreted by the courts, nullify, 
              or may be used to nullify, specific laws passed, and admittedly 
              passed, in the interest of social justice, we are for such immediate 
              law, or amendment to the Constitution, if that be necessary, as 
              will thereafter permit a reference to the people of the public effect 
              of such decision under forms securing full deliberation, to the 
              end that the specific act of the legislative branch of the Government 
              thus judicially nullified, and such amendments thereof as come within 
              its scope and purpose, may constitutionally be excepted by vote 
              of the people from the general prohibitions, the same as if that 
              particular act had been expressly excepted when the prohibition 
              was adopted. This will necessitate the establishment of machinery 
              for making much easier of amendment both the National and the several 
              State Constitutions, especially with the view of prompt action on 
              certain judicial decisions--action as specific and limited as that 
              taken by the passage of the Eleventh Amendment to the National Constitution. 
              We are not in this decrying the courts. That was reserved for the 
              Chicago Convention in its plank respecting impeachment. Impeachment 
              implies the proof of dishonesty. We do not question the general 
              honesty of the courts. But in applying to present-day social conditions 
              the general prohibitions that were intended originally as safeguards 
              to the citizen against the arbitrary power of Government in the 
              hands of caste and privilege, these prohibitions have been turned 
              by the courts from safeguards against political and social privilege 
              into barriers against political and social justice and advancement. 
              Our purpose is not to impugn the courts, but to emancipate them 
              from a position where they stand in the way of social justice; and 
              to emancipate the people, in an orderly way, front the iniquity 
              of enforced submission to a doctrine which would turn Constitutional 
              provisions which were intended to favor social justice and advancement 
              into prohibitions against such justice and advancement.</P>
            <P>We in America have peculiar need thus to make the acts of the courts 
              subject to the people, because, owing to causes which I need not 
              now discuss, the courts have here grown to occupy a position unknown 
              in any other country, a position of superiority over both the legislature 
              and the executive. Just at this time, when we have begun in this 
              country to move toward social and industrial betterment and true 
              industrial democracy, this attitude on the part of the courts is 
              of grave portent, because privilege has intrenched itself in many 
              courts, just as it formerly intrenched itself in many legislative 
              bodies and in many executive offices. Even in England, where the 
              Constitution is based upon the theory of the supremacy of the legislative 
              body over the courts, the cause of democracy has at times been hampered 
              by court action. In a recent book by a notable English Liberal leader, 
              Mr. L. T. Hobhouse, there occurs the following sentences dealing 
              with this subject:</P>
            <P><I>&quot;Labor itself had experienced the full brunt of the attack. 
              It had come, not from the politicians, but from the judges; but 
              in this country we have to realize that within wide limits the judges 
              are in effect legislators, and legislators with a certain persistent 
              bent which can be held in check only by the constant vigilance and 
              repeated efforts of the recognized organ for the making and repeal 
              of law.&quot;</I></P>
            <P>It thus appears that even in England it is necessary to exercise 
              vigilance in order to prevent reactionary thwarting of the popular 
              will by courts that are subject to the power of the Legislature. 
              In the United States, where the courts are supreme over the Legislature, 
              it is vital that the people should keep in their own hands the right 
              of interpreting their own Constitution when their public servants 
              differ as to the interpretation.</P>
            <P>I am well aware that every upholder of privilege, every hired agent 
              or beneficiary of the special interests, including many well-meaning 
              parlor reformers, will denounce all this as &quot;Socialism&quot; 
              or &quot;anarchy&quot;--the same terms they used in the past in 
              denouncing the movements to control the railways and to control 
              public utilities. As a matter of fact, the propositions I make constitute 
              neither anarchy nor Socialism, but, on the contrary, a corrective 
              to Socialism and an antidote to anarchy.</P>

            <P>I especially challenge the attention of the people to the need 
              of dealing in far-reaching fashion with our human resources, and 
              therefore our labor power. In a century and a quarter as a nation 
              the American people have subdued and settled the vast reaches of 
              a continent; ahead lies the greater task of building upon this foundation, 
              by themselves, for themselves, and with themselves, an American 
              common wealth which in its social and economic structure shall be 
              four square with democracy. With England striving to make good the 
              human wreckage to which a scrapheap scheme of industrialism has 
              relegated her, with Germany putting the painstaking resources of 
              an Empire at the work of developing her crafts and industrial sciences, 
              with the Far East placing in the hands of its millions the tools 
              invented and fashioned by Western civilization, it behooves Americans 
              to keep abreast of the great industrial changes and to show that 
              the people themselves, through popular self-government, call meet 
              an age of crisis with wisdom and strength.</P>
            <P>In the last twenty years an increasing percentage of our people 
              have come to depend on industry for their livelihood, so that today 
              the wage-workers in industry rank in importance side by side with 
              the tillers of the soil. As a people we cannot afford to let any 
              group of citizens or any individual citizen live or labor under 
              conditions which are injurious to the common welfare. Industry, 
              therefore, must submit to such public regulation as will make it 
              a means of life and health, not of death or inefficiency. We must 
              protect the crushable elements at the base of our present industrial 
              structure.</P>
            <P>The first charge on the industrial statesmanship of the day is 
              to prevent human waste. The dead weight of orphanage and depleted 
              craftsmanship, of crippled workers and workers suffering from trade 
              diseases, of casual labor, of insecure old age, and of household 
              depletion due to industrial conditions are, like our depleted soils, 
              our gashed mountain-sides and flooded river bottoms, so many strains 
              upon the National structure, draining the reserve strength of all 
              industries and showing beyond all peradventure the public element 
              and public concern in industrial health.</P>
            <P>Ultimately we desire to use the Government to aid, as far as can 
              safely be done, in helping the industrial tool-users to become in 
              part tool-owners, just as our farmers now are. Ultimately the Government 
              may have to join more efficiently than at present in strengthening 
              the hands of the workingmen who already stand at a high level, industrially 
              and socially, and who are able by joint action to serve themselves. 
              But the most pressing and immediate need is to deal with the cases 
              of those who are on the level, and who are not only in need themselves, 
              but, because of their need, tend to jeopardize the welfare of those 
              who are better off. We hold that under no industrial order, in no 
              commonwealth, in no trade, and in no establishment should industry 
              be carried on under conditions inimical to the social welfare. The 
              abnormal, ruthless, spendthrift industry of establishment tends 
              to drag down all to the level of the least considerate.</P>
            <P>Here the sovereign responsibility of the people as a whole should 
              be placed beyond all quibble and dispute.</P>
            <P>The public needs have been well summarized as follows:</P>
            <OL>
              <LI>We hold that the public has a right to complete knowledge of 
                the facts of work. 
              <LI>On the basis of these facts and with the recent discoveries 
                of physicians and neurologists, engineers and economists, the 
                public call formulate minimum occupational standards below which, 
                demonstrably, work can be prosecuted only at a human deficit. 
              <LI>In the third place, we hold that all industrial conditions which 
                fall below such standards should come within the scope of governmental 
                action and control in the same way that subnormal sanitary conditions 
                are subject to public regulation and for the same reason--because 
                they threaten the general welfare. 
            </OL>
            <P>To the first end, we hold that the constituted authorities should 
              be empowered to require all employers to file with them for public 
              purposes such wage scales and other data as the public element in 
              industry demands. The movement for honest weights and measures has 
              its counterpart in industry. All tallies, scales and check systems 
              should be open to public inspection and inspection of committees 
              of the workers concerned. All deaths, injuries, and diseases due 
              to industrial operation should be reported to public authorities.</P>
            <P>To the second end, we hold that minimum wage commissions should 
              be established in the Nation and in each State to inquire into wages 
              paid in various industries and to determine the standard which the 
              public ought to sanction as a minimum; and we believe that, as a 
              present installment of what we hope for in the future, there should 
              be at once established in the Nation and its several States minimum 
              standards for the wages of women, taking the present Massachusetts 
              law as a basis from which to start and on which to improve. We pledge 
              the Federal Government to an investigation of industries along the 
              lines pursued by the Bureau of Alines with the view to establishing 
              standards of sanitation and safety; we call for the standardization 
              of mine and factory inspection by interstate agreement or the establishment 
              of a Federal standard. We stand for the passage of legislation in 
              the Nation and in all States providing standards of compensation 
              for industrial accidents and death, and for diseases clearly due 
              to the nature of conditions of industry, and we stand for the adoption 
              by law of a fair standard of compensation for casualties resulting 
              fatally which shall clearly fix the minimum compensation in all 
              cases.</P>
            <P>In the third place, certain industrial conditions fall clearly 
              below the levels which the public today sanction.</P>
            <P>We stand for a living wage. Wages are subnormal if they fail to 
              provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial 
              occupations. The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according 
              to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements 
              of a normal standard of living--a standard high enough to make morality 
              possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature 
              members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of 
              sickness, and to permit of reasonable saving for old age.</P>
            <P>Hours are excessive if they fail to afford the worker sufficient 
              time to recuperate and return to his work thoroughly refreshed. 
              We hold that the night labor of women and children is abnormal and 
              should be prohibited; we hold that the employment of women over 
              forty-eight hours per week is abnormal and should be prohibited. 
              We hold that the seven day working week is abnormal, and we hold 
              that one day of rest in seven should be provided in law. We hold 
              that the continuous industries, operating twenty-four hours out 
              of twenty-four, are abnormal, and where, because of public necessity 
              or of technical reasons (such as molten metal), the twenty-four 
              hours must be divided into two shifts of twelve hours or three shifts 
              of eight, they should by law be divided into three of eight.</P>
            <P>Safety conditions are abnormal when, through unguarded machinery, 
              poisons, electrical voltage, or otherwise, the workers are subjected 
              to unnecessary hazards of life and limb; and all such occupations 
              should come under governmental regulation and control.</P>
            <P>Home life is abnormal when tenement manufacture is carried on in 
              the household. It is a serious menace to health, education, and 
              childhood, and should therefore be entirely prohibited. Temporary 
              construction camps are abnormal homes and should be subjected to 
              governmental sanitary regulation.</P>
            <P>The premature employment of children is abnormal and should be 
              prohibited; so also the employment of women in manufacturing, commerce, 
              or other trades where work compels standing constantly; and also 
              any employment of women in such trades for a period of at least 
              eight weeks at time of childbirth.</P>
            <P>Our aim should be to secure conditions which will tend everywhere 
              towards regular industry, and will do away with the necessity for 
              rush periods, followed by out-of-work seasons, which put so severe 
              a strain on wage-workers.</P>
            <P>It is abnormal for any industry to throw back upon the community 
              the human wreckage due to its wear and tear, and the hazzards of 
              sickness, accident, invalidism, involuntary unemployment, and old 
              age should be provided for through insurance. This should be made 
              a charge in whole or in part upon the industries the employer, the 
              employee, and perhaps the people at large, to contribute severally 
              in some degree. Wherever such standards are not met by given establishments, 
              by given industries, are unprovided for by a legislature, or are 
              balked by unenlightened courts, the workers are in jeopardy, the 
              progressive employer is penalized, and the community pays a heavy 
              cost in lessened efficiency and in misery. What Germany has done 
              in the way of old age pensions or insurance should be studied by 
              us, and the system adapted to our uses, with whatever modifications 
              are rendered necessary by our different ways of life and habits 
              of thought.</P>
            <P>Workingwomen have the same need to combine for protection that 
              workingmen have; the ballot is as necessary for one class as for 
              the other; we do not believe that with the two sexes there is identity 
              of function; but we do believe that there should be equality of 
              right; and therefore we favor woman suffrage. In those conservative 
              States where there is genuine doubt how the women stand on this 
              matter I suggest that it be referred to a vote of the women, so 
              that they may themselves make the decision. Surely if women could 
              vote, they would strengthen the hands of those who are endeavoring 
              to deal in efficient fashion with evils such as the white slave 
              traffic; evils which can in part be dealt with Nationally, but which 
              in large part can be reached only by determined local action, such 
              as insisting on the widespread publication of the names of the owners, 
              the landlords, of houses used for immoral purposes.</P>
            <P>No people are more vitally interested than workingmen and workingwomen 
              in questions affecting the public health. The pure food law must 
              be strengthened and efficiently enforced. In the National Government 
              one department should be intrusted with all the agencies relating 
              to the public health, from the enforcement of the pure food law 
              to the administration of quarantine. This department, through its 
              special health service, would co-operate intelligently with the 
              various State and municipal bodies established for the same end. 
              There would be no discrimination against or for any one set of therapeutic 
              methods, against or for any one school of medicine or system of 
              healing; the aim would be merely to secure under one administrative 
              body efficient sanitary regulation in the interest of the people 
              as a whole.</P>

            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">THE FARMER</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>There is no body of our people whose interests are more inextricably 
              interwoven with the interests of all the people than is the case 
              with the farmers. The Country Life Commission should be revived 
              with greatly increased powers; its abandonment was a severe blow 
              to the interests of our people. The welfare of the farmer is a basic 
              need of this Nation. It is the men from the farm who in the past 
              have taken the lead in every great movement within this Nation, 
              whether in time of war or in time of peace. It is well to have our 
              cities prosper, but it is not well if they prosper at the expense 
              of the country. I am glad to say that in many sections of our country 
              there has been an extraordinary revival of recent years in intelligent 
              interest in and work for those who live in the open country. In 
              this movement the lead must be taken by the farmers themselves; 
              but our people as a whole, through their governmental agencies, 
              should back the farmers. Everything possible should be done to better 
              the economic condition of the farmer, and also to increase the social 
              value of the life of the farmer, the farmer's wife, and their children. 
              The burdens of labor and loneliness bear heavily on the women in 
              the country; their welfare should be the especial concern of all 
              of us. Everything possible should be done to make life in the country 
              profitable so as to be attractive from the economic standpoint and 
              also to give an outlet among farming people for those forms of activity 
              which now tend to make life in the cities especially desirable for 
              ambitious men and women. There should be just the same chance to 
              live as full, as well-rounded, and as highly useful lives in the 
              country as in the city.</P>
            <P>The Government must co-operate with the farmer to make the farm 
              more productive. There must be no skinning of the soil. The farm 
              should be left to the farmer's soil in better, and not worse, condition 
              because of its cultivation. Moreover, every invention and improvement, 
              every discovery and economy, should be at the service of the farmer 
              in the work of production; and, in addition, he should be helped 
              to co-operate in business fashion with his fellows, so that the 
              money paid by the consumer for the product of the soil shall to 
              as large a degree as possible go into the pockets of the man who 
              raised that product from the soil. So long as the farmer leaves 
              co-operative activities with their profit-sharing to the city man 
              of business, so long will the foundations of wealth be undermined 
              and the comforts of enlightenment be impossible in the country communities. 
              In every respect this Nation has to learn the lessons of efficiency 
              in production and distribution, and of avoidance of waste and destruction; 
              we must develop and improve instead of exhausting our resources. 
              It is entirely possible by improvements in production, in the avoidance 
              of waste, and in business methods on the part of the farmer to give 
              him all increased income from his farm while at the same time reducing 
              to the consumer the price of the articles raised on the farm. Important 
              although education is everywhere, it has a special importance in 
              the country. The country school must fit the country life; in the 
              country, as elsewhere, education must be hitched up with life. The 
              country church and the country Young Men's and Young Women's Christian 
              Associations have great parts to play. The farmers must own and 
              work their own land; steps must be taken at once to put a stop to 
              the tendency towards absentee landlordism and tenant farming; this 
              is one of the most imperative duties confronting the Nation. The 
              question of rural banking and rural credits is also of immediate 
              importance.</P>
            <P> <BR>
              <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">BUSINESS AND THE CONTROL OF THE TRUSTS</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>The present conditions of business cannot be accepted as satisfactory. 
              There are too many who do not prosper enough, and of the few who 
              prosper greatly there are certainly some whose prosperity does not 
              mean well for the country. Rational Progressives, no matter how 
              radical, are well aware that nothing the Government can do will 
              make some men prosper, and we heartily approve the prosperity, no 
              matter how great, of any man, if it comes as an incident to rendering 
              service to the community; but we wish to shape conditions so that 
              a greater number of the small men who are decent, industrious and 
              energetic shall be able to succeed, and so that the big man who 
              is dishonest shall not be allowed to succeed at all.</P>
            <P>Our aim is to control business, not to strangle it--and, above 
              all, not to continue a policy of make-believe strangle toward big 
              concerns that do evil, and constant menace toward both big and little 
              concerns that do well. Our aim is to promote prosperity, and then 
              see to its proper division. We do not believe that any good comes 
              to any one by a policy which means destruction of prosperity; for 
              in such cases it is not possible to divide it because of the very 
              obvious fact that there is nothing to divide. We wish to control 
              big business so as to secure among other things good wages for the 
              wage-workers and reasonable prices for the consumers. Wherever in 
              any business the prosperity of the business man is obtained by lowering 
              the wages of his workmen and charging an excessive price to the 
              consumers we wish to interfere and stop such practices. We will 
              not submit to that kind of prosperity any more than we will submit 
              to prosperity obtained by swindling investors or getting unfair 
              advantages over business rivals. But it is obvious that unless the 
              business is prosperous the wage-workers employed therein will be 
              badly paid and the consumers badly served. Therefore not merely 
              as a matter of justice to the business man, but from the standpoint 
              of the self-interest of the wage-worker and the consumer we desire 
              that business shall prosper; but it should be so supervised as to 
              make prosperity also take the shape of good wages to the wage-worker 
              and reasonable prices to the consumer, while investors and business 
              rivals are insured just treatment, and the farmer, the man who tills 
              the toil, is protected as sediously as the wage worker himself.</P>
            <P>Unfortunately, those dealing with the subject have tended to divide 
              into two camps, each as unwise as the other. One camp has fixed 
              its eyes only on the need of prosperity, loudly announcing that 
              our attention must be confined to securing it in bulk, and that 
              the division must be left to take care of itself. This is merely 
              the plan, already tested and found wanting, of giving prosperity 
              to the big men on top, and trusting to their mercy to let something 
              leak through to the mass of their countrymen below--which, in effect, 
              means that there shall be no attempt to regulate the ferocious scramble 
              in which greed and cunning reap the largest rewards. The other set 
              has fixed its eyes purely on the injustices of distribution, omitting 
              all consideration of the need of having something to distribute, 
              and advocates action which, it is true, would abolish most of the 
              inequalities of the distribution of prosperity, but only by the 
              unfortunately simple process of abolishing the prosperity itself. 
              This means merely that conditions are to be evened, not up, but 
              down, so that all shall stand on a common level, where nobody has 
              any prosperity at all. The task of the wise radical must be to refuse 
              to be misled by either set of false advisers; he must both favor 
              and promote the agencies that make for prosperity, and at the same 
              time see to it that these agencies are so used as to be primarily 
              of service to the average man.</P>
            <P>Again and again while I was President, from 1902 to 1908, I pointed 
              out that under the Anti-Trust Law alone it was neither possible 
              to put a stop to business abuses nor possible to secure the highest 
              efficiency in the service rendered by business to the general public. 
              The Anti-Trust Law must be kept on our statute-books, and, as hereafter 
              shown, must be rendered more effective in the cases where it is 
              applied. But to treat the Anti-Trust Law as an adequate, or as by 
              itself a wise, measure of relief and betterment is a sign not of 
              progress, but of toryism and reaction. It has been of benefit so 
              far as it has implied the recognition of a real and great evil, 
              and the at least sporadic application of the principle that all 
              men alike must obey the law. But as a sole remedy, universally applicable, 
              it has in actual practice completely broken down; as now applied 
              it works more mischief than benefit. It represents the waste of 
              effort--always damaging to a community--which arises from the attempt 
              to meet new conditions by the application of outworn remedies instead 
              of fearlessly and in common-sense fashion facing the new conditions 
              and devising the new remedies which alone can work effectively for 
              good. The Anti-Trust Law, if interpreted as the Baltimore platform 
              demands it shall be interpreted, would apply to every agency by 
              which not merely industrial but agricultural business is carried 
              on in this country; under such an interpretation it ought in theory 
              to be applied universally, in which case practically all industries 
              would stop; as a matter of fact, it is utterly out of the question 
              to enforce it universally; and, when enforced sporadically, it causes 
              continual unrest, puts the country at a disadvantage with its trade 
              competitors in international commerce, hopelessly puzzles honest 
              business men and honest farmers as to what their rights are, and 
              yet, as has just been shown in the cases of the Standard Oil and 
              the Tobacco Trust, it is no real check on the great trusts at which 
              it was in theory aimed, and indeed operates to their benefit. Moreover, 
              if we are to compete with other nations in the markets of the world 
              as well as to develop our own material civilization at home, we 
              must utilize those forms of industrial organization that are indispensable 
              to the highest industrial productivity and efficiency.</P>
            <P>An important volume entitled &quot;Concentration and Control&quot; 
              has just been issued by President Charles R. Van Hise, of the University 
              of Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin has been more influential 
              than any<STRONG> </STRONG>other agency in making Wisconsin what 
              it has become, a laboratory for wise social and industrial experiment 
              in the betterment of conditions. President Van Hise is one of those 
              thoroughgoing but sane and intelligent radicals from whom much of 
              leadership is to be expected in such a matter. The sub-title of 
              his book shows that his endeavor is to turn the attention of his 
              countrymen toward practically solving the trust problem of the United 
              States. In his preface he states that his aim is to suggest a way 
              to gain the economic advantages of the concentration of industry 
              and at the same time to guard the interests of the public, and to 
              assist in the rule of enlightenment, reason, fair play, mutual consideration, 
              and toleration. In sum, he shows that unrestrained competition as 
              an economic principle has become too destructive to be permitted 
              to exist, and that the small men must be allowed to co-operate under 
              penalty of succumbing before their big competitors; and yet such 
              co-operation, vitally necessary to the small man, is criminal under 
              the present law. He says:</P>
            <P><I>&quot;With the alternative before the business men of co-operation 
              or failure, we may be sure that they will co-operate. Since the 
              law is violated by practically every group of men engaged in trade 
              from one end of the country to the other, they do not feel that 
              in combining they are doing a moral wrong. The selection of the 
              individual or corporation for prosecution depends upon the arbitrary 
              choice of the Attorney-General, perhaps somewhat influenced by the 
              odium which attaches to some of the violators of the law. They all 
              take their chance, hoping that the blow will fall elsewhere. With 
              general violation and sporadic enforcement of an impracticable law, 
              we cannot hope that our people will gain respect for it.</I></P>
            <P><I>&quot;In conclusion, there is presented as the solution of the 
              difficulties of the present industrial situation, concentration, 
              co-operation, and control. Through concentration we may have the 
              economic advantages coming from magnitude of operations. Through 
              co-operation we may limit the wastes of the competitive system. 
              Through control by commission we may secure freedom for fair competition, 
              elimination of unfair practices, conservation of our natural resources, 
              fair wages, good social conditions, and reasonable prices.</I></P>
            <P><I>&quot;Concentration and co-operation in industry in order to 
              secure efficiency are a world-wide movement. The United States cannot 
              resist it. If we isolate ourselves and insist upon the subdivision 
              of industry below the highest economic efficiency, and do not allow 
              co-operation, we shall be defeated in the world's markets. We cannot 
              adopt an economic system less efficient than our great competitors, 
              Germany, England, France, and Austria. Either we must modify our 
              present obsolete laws regarding concentration and co-operation so 
              as to conform with the world movement, or else fall behind in the 
              race for the world's markets. Concentration and co-operation are 
              conditions imperatively essential for industrial advance; but if 
              we allow concentration and co-operation there must be control in 
              order to protect the people, and adequate control is only possible 
              through the administrative commission. Hence concentration, co-operation, 
              and control are the key words for a scientific solution of the mighty 
              industrial problem which now confronts this Nation.&quot;</I></P>
            <P>In his main thesis President Van Hise is unquestionably right. 
              The Democratic platform offers nothing in the way of remedy for 
              present industrial conditions except, first, the enforcement of 
              the Anti-Trust Law in a fashion which, if words mean anything, means 
              bringing business to a standstill; and, second, the insistence upon 
              an archaic construction of the States' rights doctrine in thus dealing 
              with inter-State commerce--an insistence which, in the first place, 
              is the most flagrant possible violation of the Constitution to which 
              the members of the Baltimore Convention assert their devotion, and 
              which, in the next place, nullifies and makes an empty pretense 
              of their first statement. The proposals of the platform are so conflicting 
              and so absurd that it is hard to imagine how any attempt could be 
              made in good faith to carry them out; but, if such attempt were 
              sincerely made, it could only produce industrial chaos. Were such 
              an attempt made, every man who acts honestly would have something 
              to fear, and yet no great adroit criminal able to command the advice 
              of the best corporation lawyers would have much to fear.</P>
            <P>What is needed is action directly the reverse of that thus confusedly 
              indicated. We Progressives stand for the rights of the people. When 
              these rights can best be secured by insistence upon States' rights, 
              then we are for States' rights; when they call best be secured by 
              insistence upon National rights, then we are for National rights. 
              Inter-State commerce call be effectively controlled only by the 
              Nation. The States cannot control it under the Constitution, and 
              to amend the Constitution by giving them control of it would amount 
              to a dissolution of the Government. The worst of the big trusts 
              have always endeavored to keep alive the feeling in favor of having 
              the States themselves, and not the Nation, attempt to do this work, 
              because they know that in the long-run such effort would be ineffective. 
              There is no surer way to prevent all successful effort to deal with 
              the trusts than to insist that they be dealt with by the States 
              rather than by the Nation, or to create a conflict between the States 
              and the Nation on the subject. The well-meaning ignorant man who 
              advances such a proposition does as much damage as if he were hired 
              by the trusts themselves, for he is playing the game of every big 
              crooked corporation in the country. The only effective way in which 
              to regulate the trusts is through the exercise of the collective 
              power of our people as a whole through the Governmental agencies 
              established by the Constitution for this very purpose. Grave injustice 
              is done by the Congress when it fails to give the National Government 
              complete power in this matter; and still graver injustice by the 
              federal courts when they endeavor in any way to pare down the right 
              of the people collectively to act in this matter as they deem wise; 
              such conduct does itself tend to cause the creation of a twilight 
              zone in which neither the Nation nor the States have power. Fortunately, 
              the Federal courts have more and more of recent years tended to 
              adopt the true doctrine, which is that all these matters are to 
              be settled by the people themselves, and that the conscience of 
              the people, and not the preferences of any servants of the people, 
              is to be the standard in deciding what action shall be taken by 
              the people. As Lincoln phrased it: <I>&quot;The [question] of National 
              power and State rights as a principle is no other than the principle 
              of generality and locality. Whatever concerns the whole should be 
              confided to the whole--to the General Government; while whatever 
              concerns only the State should be left exclusively to the State.&quot;</I></P>
            <P>It is utterly hopeless to attempt to control the trusts merely 
              by the Anti-Trust Law, or by any law the same in principle, no matter 
              what the modifications may be in detail. In the first place, these 
              great corporations cannot possibly be controlled merely by a succession 
              of lawsuits. The administrative branch of the Government must exercise 
              such control. The preposterous failure of the Commerce Court has 
              shown that only damage comes from the effort to substitute judicial 
              for administrative control of great corporations. In the next place, 
              a loosely drawn law which promises to do everything would reduce 
              business to complete ruin if it were not also so drawn as to accomplish 
              almost nothing.</P>
            <P>As construed by the Democratic platform, the Anti-Trust Law would, 
              if it could be enforced, abolish all business of any size or any 
              efficiency. The promise thus to apply and construe the law would 
              undoubtedly be broken, but the mere fitful effort thus to apply 
              it would do no good whatever, would accomplish widespread harm, 
              and would bring all trust legislation into contempt. Contrast what 
              has actually been accomplished under the Inter-State Commerce Law 
              with what has actually been accomplished under the Anti-Trust Law. 
              The first has, on the whole, worked in a highly efficient manner 
              and achieved real and great results; and it promises to achieve 
              even greater results (although I firmly believe that if the power 
              of the Commissioners grows greater, it will be necessary to make 
              them and their superior, the President, even more completely responsible 
              to the people for their acts). The second has occasionally done 
              good, has usually accomplished nothing, has generally left the worst 
              conditions wholly unchanged, and has been responsible for a considerable 
              amount of downright and positive evil.</P>
            <P>What is needed is the application to all industrial concerns and 
              all co-operating interests engaged in inter-State commerce in which 
              there is either monopoly or control of the market of the principles 
              on which we have gone in regulating transportation concerns engaged 
              in such commerce. The Anti-Trust Law should be kept on the statute-books 
              and strengthened so as to make it genuinely and thoroughly effective 
              against every big concern tending to monopoly or guilty of anti-social 
              practices. At the same time, a National industrial commission should 
              be created which should have complete power to regulate and control 
              all the great industrial concerns engaged in inter-State business--which 
              practically means all of them in this country. This commission should 
              exercise over these industrial concerns like powers to those exercised 
              over the railways by the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and over 
              the<STRONG> </STRONG>National banks by the Comptroller of the Currency, 
              and additional powers if found necessary. The establishment of such 
              a commission would enable us to punish the individual rather than 
              merely the corporation, just as we now do with banks, where the 
              aim of the Government is not to close the bank, but to bring to 
              justice personally any bank official who has gone wrong. This commission 
              should deal with all the abuses of the trusts--all the abuses such 
              as those developed by the Government suit against the Standard Oil 
              and Tobacco Trusts--as the Inter-State Commerce Commission now deals 
              with rebates. It should have complete power to make the capitalization 
              absolutely honest and put a stop to all stock watering. Such supervision 
              over the issuance of corporate securities would put a stop to exploitation 
              of the people by dishonest capitalists desiring to declare dividends 
              on watered securities, and would open this kind of industrial property 
              to ownership by the people at large. It should have free access 
              to the books of each corporation and power to find out exactly how 
              it treats its employees, its rivals, and the general public. It 
              should have power to compel the unsparing publicity of all the acts 
              of any corporation which goes wrong. The regulation should be primarily 
              under the administrative branch of the Government, and not by lawsuit. 
              It should prohibit and effectually punish monopoly achieved through 
              wrong, and also actual wrongs done by industrial corporations which 
              are not monopolies, such as the artificial raising of prices, the 
              artificial restriction on productivity, the elimination of competition 
              by unfair or predatory practices, and the like; leaving industrial 
              organizations free within the limits of fair and honest dealing 
              to promote through the inherent efficiency of organization the power 
              of the United States as a competitive nation among nations, and 
              the greater abundance at home that will come to our people from 
              that power wisely exercised. Any corporation voluntarily coming 
              under the commission should not be prosecuted under the Anti-Trust 
              Law as long as it obeys in good faith the orders of the commission. 
              The commission would be able to interpret in advance, to any honest 
              man asking the interpretation, what he may do and what he may not 
              do in carrying on a legitimate business. Any corporation not corning 
              under the commission should be exposed to prosecution under the 
              Anti-Trust Law, and any corporation violating the orders of the 
              commission should also at once become exposed to such prosecution; 
              and when such a prosecution is successful, it should be the duty 
              of the commission to see that the decree of the Court is put into 
              effect completely and in good faith, so that the combination is 
              absolutely broken up, and is not allowed to come together again, 
              nor the constituent parts thereof permitted to do business save 
              under the conditions laid down by the commission. This last provision 
              would prevent the repetition of such gross scandals as those attendant 
              upon the present Administration's prosecution of the Standard Oil 
              and the Tobacco Trusts. The Supreme Court of the United States in 
              condemning these two trusts to dissolution used language of unsparing 
              severity concerning their actions. But the decree was carried out 
              in such a manner as to turn into a farce this bitter condemnation 
              of the criminals by the highest court in the country, Not one particle 
              of benefit to the community at large was gained; on the contrary, 
              the prices went up to consumers, independent competitors were placed 
              in greater jeopardy than ever before, and the possessions of the 
              wrong-doers greatly appreciated in value. There never was a more 
              flagrant travesty of justice, never an instance in which wealthy 
              wrong-doers benefitted more conspicuously by a law which was supposed 
              to be aimed at them, and which undoubtedly would have brought about 
              severe punishment of less wealthy wrong-doers.</P>
            <P>The Progressive proposal is definite. It is practicable. We promise 
              nothing that we cannot carry out. We promise nothing which will 
              jeopardize honest business. We promise adequate control of all big 
              business and the stern suppression of the evils connected with big 
              business, and this promise we can absolutely keep. Our proposal 
              is to help honest business activity, however extensive, and to see 
              that it is rewarded with fair returns so that there may be no oppression 
              either of business men or of the common people. We propose to make 
              it worth while for our business men to develop the most efficient 
              business agencies for use in international trade; for it is to the 
              interest of our whole people that we should do well in international 
              business. But we propose to make those business agencies do complete 
              justice to our own people. Every dishonest business man will unquestionably 
              prefer either the programme of the Republican Convention or the 
              programme of the Democratic Convention to our proposal, because 
              neither of these programmes means or can mean what it purports to 
              mean. But every honest business man, big or little, should support 
              the Progressive programme, and it is the one and only programme 
              which offers real hope to all our people; for it is the one programme 
              under which the Government can be used with real efficiency to see 
              justice done by the big corporation alike to the wage-earners it 
              employs, to the small rivals with whom it competes, to the investors 
              who purchase its securities, and to the consumers who purchase its 
              products or to the general public which it ought to serve, as well 
              as to the business man himself.</P>
            <P>We favor co-operation in business, and ask only that it be carried 
              on in a spirit of honesty and fairness. We are against crooked business, 
              big or little. We are in favor of honest business, big or little. 
              We propose to penalize conduct and not size. But all very big business, 
              even though honestly conducted, is fraught with such potentiality 
              of menace that there should be thoroughgoing governmental control 
              over it, so that its efficiency in promoting prosperity at home 
              and increasing the power of the Nation in international commerce 
              may be maintained, and at the same time fair play insured to the 
              wage-workers, the small business competitors, the investors, and 
              the general public. Wherever it is practicable we propose to preserve 
              competition; but where under modern conditions competition has been 
              eliminated and cannot be successfully restored, then the Government 
              must step in and itself supply the needed control on behalf of the 
              people as a whole.</P>
            <P>It is imperative to the welfare of our people that we enlarge and 
              extend our foreign commerce. We are pre-eminently fitted to do this 
              because as a people we have developed high skill inthe art of manufacturing; 
              our business-men are strong executives, strong organizers. In every 
              way possible our Federal Government should co-operate in this important 
              matter. Any one who has had opportunity to study and observe first-hand 
              Germany's course in this respect must realize that their policy 
              of co-operation between Government and business has in comparatively 
              few years made them a leading competitor for the commerce of the 
              world. It should be remembered that they are doing this on a national 
              scale and with large units of business, while the Democrats would 
              have us believe that we should do it with small units of business, 
              which would be controlled not by the National Government but by 
              forty-nine conflicting State sovereignties. Such a policy is utterly 
              out of keeping with the progress of the times and gives our great 
              commercial rivals in Europe--hungry for international markets--golden 
              opportunities of which they are rapidly taking advantage.</P>
            <P>I very much wish that legitimate business would no longer permit 
              itself to be frightened by the outcries of illegitimate business 
              into believing that they have any community of interest. Legitimate 
              business ought to understand that its interests are jeopardized 
              when they are confounded with those of illegitimate business; and 
              the latter, whenever threatened with just control, always tries 
              to persuade the former that it also is endangered. As a matter of 
              fact, if legitimate business can only be persuaded to look cool-headedly 
              into our proposition, it is bound to support us.</P>
            <P>There are a number of lesser, but still important, ways of improving 
              our business situation. It is not necessary to enumerate all of 
              them; but I desire to allude to two, which can be adopted forthwith. 
              Our patent laws should be remodeled; patents can secure ample royalties 
              to investors without our permitting them to be tools of monopoly 
              or shut out from general use; and a parcels post, on the zone principle, 
              should be established.</P>
            <P></P>
            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">THE TARIFF</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>I believe in a protective tariff, but I believe in it as a principle, 
              approached from the standpoint of the interests of the whole people, 
              and not as a bundle of preferences to be given to favored individuals. 
              In my opinion, the American people favor the principle of a protective 
              tariff, but they desire such a tariff to be established primarily 
              in the interests of the wage-worker and the consumer. The chief 
              opposition to our tariff at the present moment comes from the general 
              conviction that certain interests have been improperly favored by 
              over-protection. I agree with this view. The commercial and industrial 
              experience of this country has demonstrated the wisdom of the protective 
              policy, but it has also demonstrated that in the application of 
              that policy certain clearly recognized abuses have developed. It 
              is not merely the tariff that should be revised, but the method 
              of tariff-making and of tariff administration. Wherever nowadays 
              an industry is to be protected it should be on the theory that such 
              protection will serve to keep up the wages and the standard of living 
              of the wage-worker in that industry with full regard for the interest 
              of the consumer. To accomplish this the tariff to be levied should 
              as nearly as is scientifically possible approximate the differential 
              between the cost of production at home and abroad. This differential 
              is chiefly, if not wholly, in labor cost. No duty should be permitted 
              to stand as regards any industry unless the workers receive their 
              full share of the benefits of that duty. In other words, there is 
              no warrant for protection unless a legitimate share of the benefits 
              gets into the pay envelope of the wage-worker.</P>
            <P>The practice of undertaking a general revision of all the schedules 
              at one time and of securing information as to conditions in the 
              different industries and as to rates of duty desired chiefly from 
              those engaged in the industries, who themselves benefit directly 
              from the rates they propose, has been demonstrated to be not only 
              iniquitous but futile. It has afforded opportunity for practically 
              all of the abuses which have crept into our tariff-making and our 
              tariff administration. The day of the log-rolling tariff must end. 
              The progressive thought of the country has recognized this fact 
              for several years, and the time has come when all genuine Progressives 
              should insist upon a thorough and radical change in the method of 
              tariff-making.</P>
            <P>The first step should be the creation of a permanent commission 
              of non-partisan experts whose business shall be to study scientifically 
              all phases of tariff-making and of tariff effects. This commission 
              should be large enough to cover all the different and widely varying 
              branches of American industry. It should have ample powers to enable 
              it to secure exact and reliable information. It should have authority 
              to examine closely all correlated subjects, such as the effect of 
              any given duty on the consumers of the article on which the duty 
              is levied; that is, it should directly consider the question as 
              to what any duty costs the people in the price of living. It should 
              examine into the wages and conditions of labor and life of the workingmen 
              in any industry, so as to insure our refusing protection to any 
              industry unless the showing as regards the share labor receives 
              therefrom is satisfactory. This commission would be wholly different 
              from the present unsatisfactory Tariff Board, which was created 
              under a provision of law which failed to give it the powers indispensable 
              if it was to do the work it should do.</P>
            <P>It will be well for us to study the experience of Germany in considering 
              this question. The German Tariff Commission has proved conclusively 
              the efficiency and wisdom of this method of handling tariff questions. 
              The reports of a permanent, expert, and non-partisan tariff commission 
              would at once strike a most powerful blow against the chief iniquity 
              of the old log-rolling method of tariff-making. One of the principal 
              difficulties with the old method has been that it was impossible 
              for the public generally, and especially for those Members of Congress 
              not directly connected with the committees handling a tariff bill, 
              to secure anything like adequate and impartial information on the 
              particular subjects under consideration. The reports of such a tariff 
              commission would at once correct this evil and furnish to the general 
              public full, complete, and disinterested information on every subject 
              treated in a tariff bill. With such reports it would no longer be 
              possible to construct a tariff bill in secret or to jam it through 
              either house of Congress without the fullest and most illuminating 
              discussion. The path of the tariff &quot;joker&quot; would be rendered 
              infinitely difficult.</P>
            <P>As a further means of disrupting the old crooked, log-rolling method 
              of tariff-making, all future revisions of the tariff should be made 
              schedule by schedule as changing conditions may require. Thus a 
              great obstacle will be thrown in the way of the trading of votes 
              which has marked so scandalously the enactment of every tariff bill 
              of recent years. The tariff commission should render reports at 
              the call of Congress or of either branch of Congress and to the 
              President. Under the Constitution, Congress is the tariff-making 
              power. It should not be the purpose in creating a tariff commission 
              to take anything away from this power of Congress, but rather to 
              afford a wise means of giving to Congress the widest and most scientific 
              assistance possible, and of furnishing it and the public with the 
              fullest disinterested information. Only by this means can the tariff 
              be taken out of politics. The creation of such a permanent tariff 
              commission, and the adoption of the policy of schedule by schedule 
              revision, will do more to accomplish this highly desired object 
              than any other means yet devised.</P>
            <P>The Democratic platform declares for a tariff for revenue only, 
              asserting that a protective tariff is unconstitutional. To say that 
              a protective tariff is unconstitutional, as the Democratic platform 
              insists, is only excusable on a theory of the Constitution which 
              would make it unconstitutional to legislate in any shape or way 
              for the betterment of social and industrial conditions. The abolition 
              of the protective tariff or the substitution for it of a tariff 
              for revenue only, as proposed by the Democratic platform, would 
              plunge this country into the most widespread industrial depression 
              we have yet seen, and this depression would continue for an indefinite 
              period. There is no hope from the standpoint of our people from 
              action such the Democrats propose. The one and only chance to secure 
              stable and favorable business conditions in this country, while 
              at the same time guaranteeing fair play to farmer, consumer, business 
              man, and wage-worker, lies in the creation of such a commission 
              as I herein advocate. Only by such a commission and only by such 
              activities of the commission will it be possible for us to get a 
              reasonably quick revision of the tariff schedule by schedule--a 
              revision which shall be downwards and not upwards, and at the same 
              time secure a square deal not merely to the manufacturer, but to 
              the wage-worker and to the general consumer.</P>

              <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">THE HIGH COST OF LIVING</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>There can be no more important question than the high cost of living 
              necessities. The main purpose of the Progressive movement is to 
              place the American people in possession of their birthright, to 
              secure for all the American people unobstructed access to the fountains 
              of measureless prosperity which their Creator offers them. We in 
              this country are blessed with great natural resources, and our men 
              and women have a very high standard of intelligence and of industrial 
              capacity. Surely such being the case, we cannot permanently support 
              conditions under which each family finds it increasingly difficult 
              to secure the necessaries of life and a fair share of its comforts 
              through the earnings of its members. The cost of living in this 
              country has risen during the last few years out of all proportion 
              to the increase in the rate of most salaries and wages; the same 
              situation confronts alike the majority of wage-workers, small business 
              men, small professional men, the clerks, the doctors, clergymen. 
              Now, grave though the problem is, there is one way to make it graver, 
              and that is to deal with it insincerely, to advance false remedies, 
              to promise the impossible. Our opponents, Republicans and Democrats 
              alike, propose to deal with it in this way. The Republicans in their 
              platform promise all inquiry into the facts. Most certainly there 
              should be such inquiry. But the way the present Administration has 
              failed to keep its promises in the past, and the rank dishonesty 
              of action on the part of the Penrose-Barnes-Guggenheim National 
              Convention, makes their every promise worthless. The Democratic 
              platform affects to find the entire cause of the high cost of living 
              in the tariff, and promises to remedy it by free trade, especially 
              free trade in the necessaries of life. In the first place, this 
              attitude ignores the patent fact that the problem is world-wide, 
              that everywhere, in England and France, as in Germany and Japan, 
              it appears with greater or less severity; that in England, for instance, 
              it has become a very severe problem, although neither the tariff 
              nor, save to a small degree, the trusts can there have any possible 
              effect upon the situation. In the second place, the Democratic platform, 
              if it is sincere, must mean that all duties will be taken off the 
              products of the farmer. Yet most certainly we cannot afford to have 
              the farmer struck down. The welfare of the tiller of the soil is 
              as important as the welfare of the wage worker himself, and we must 
              sedulously guard both. The farmer, the producer of the necessities 
              of life, can himself live only if he raises these necessities for 
              a profit. On the other hand, the consumer who must have that farmer's 
              product in order to live, must be allowed to purchase it at the 
              lowest cost that can give the farmer his profit, and everything 
              possible must be done to eliminate any middleman whose function 
              does not tend to increase the cheapness of distribution of the product; 
              and, moreover, everything must be done to stop all speculating, 
              all gambling with the bread-basket which has even the slightest 
              deleterious effect upon the producer and consumer. There must be 
              legislation which will bring about a closer business relationship 
              between the farmer and the consumer. Recently experts in the Agricultural 
              Department have figured that nearly fifty per cent of the price 
              for agricultural products paid by the consumer goes into the pockets, 
              not of the farmer, but of various middlemen; and it is probable 
              that over half of what is thus paid to middlemen is needless, can 
              be saved by wise business methods (introduced through both law and 
              custom), and can therefore be returned to the farmer and the consumer. 
              Through the proposed Inter-State Industrial Commission we can effectively 
              do away with any arbitrary control by combinations of the necessities 
              of life. Furthermore, the Governments of the Nation and of the several 
              States must combine in doing everything they can to make the farming 
              business profitable, so that he shall get more out of the soil, 
              and enjoy better business facilities for marketing what he thus 
              gets. In this manner his return will be increased while the price 
              to the consumer is diminished. The elimination of the middleman 
              by agricultural exchanges and by the use of improved business methods 
              generally, the development of good roads, the reclamation of arid 
              lands and swamp lands, the improvement in the productivity of farms, 
              the encouragement of all agencies which tend to bring people back 
              to the soil and to make country life more interesting as well as 
              more profitable--all these movements will help not only the farmer 
              but the man who consumes the farmer's products.</P>
            <P>There is urgent need of non-partisan expert examination into any 
              tariff schedule which seems to increase the cost of living, and, 
              unless the increase thus caused is more than countervailed by the 
              benefit to the class of the community which actually receives the 
              protection, it must of course mean that that particular duty must 
              be reduced. The system of levying a tariff for the protection and 
              encouragement of American industry so as to secure higher wages 
              and better conditions of life for American laborers must never be 
              perverted so as to operate for the impoverishment of those whom 
              it was intended to benefit. But, in any event, the effect of the 
              tariff on the cost of living is slight; any householder can satisfy 
              himself of this fact by considering the increase in price of articles, 
              like milk and eggs, where the influence of both the tariff and the 
              trusts is negligible. No conditions have been shown which warrant 
              us in believing that the abolition of the protective tariff as a 
              whole would bring any substantial benefit to the consumer, while 
              it would certainly cause unheard of immediate disaster to all wage-workers, 
              all business men, and all farmers, and in all probability would 
              permanently lower the standard of living here. In order to show 
              the utter futility of the belief that the abolition of the tariff 
              and the establishment of free trade would remedy the condition complained 
              of, all that is necessary is to look at the course of industrial 
              events in England and in Germany during the last thirty years, the 
              former under free trade, the latter under a protective system. During 
              these thirty years it is a matter of common knowledge that Germany 
              has forged ahead relatively to England, and this not only as regards 
              the employers, but as regards the wage-earners--in short, as regards 
              all members of the industrial classes. Doubtless, many causes have 
              combined to produce this result; it is not to be ascribed to the 
              tariff alone, but, on the other hand it is evident that it could 
              not have come about if a protective tariff were even a chief cause 
              among many other causes of the high cost of living.</P>
            <P>It is also asserted that the trusts are responsible for the high 
              cost of living. I have no question that, as regards certain trusts, 
              this is true. I also have no question that it will continue to be 
              true just as long as the country<STRONG> </STRONG>confines itself 
              to acting as the Baltimore platform demands that we act. This demand 
              is, in effect, for the States and National Government to make the 
              futile attempt to exercise forty-nine sovereign and conflicting 
              authorities in the effort jointly to suppress the trusts, while 
              at the same time the National Government refuses to exercise proper 
              control over them. There will be no diminution in the cost of trust-made 
              articles so long as our Government attempts the impossible task 
              of restoring the flint-lock conditions of business sixty years ago 
              by trusting only to a succession of lawsuits under the Anti-Trust 
              Law--a method which it has been definitely shown usually results 
              to the benefit of any big business concern which really ought to 
              be dissolved, but which cause disturbance and distress to multitudes 
              of smaller concerns. Trusts which increase production--unless they 
              do it wastefully, as in certain forms of mining and lumbering--cannot 
              permanently increase the cost of living; it is the trusts which 
              limit production, or which without limiting production, take advantage 
              of the lack of governmental control, and eliminate competition by 
              combining to control the market, that cause all increase in the 
              cost of living. There should be established at once, as I have elsewhere 
              said, under the National Government an inter-State industrial commission, 
              which should exercise full supervision over the big industrial concerns 
              doing an inter-State business into which an element of monopoly 
              enters. Where these concerns deal with the necessaries of life the 
              commission should not shrink, if the necessity is proved, of going 
              to the extent of exercising regulatory control over the conditions 
              that create or determine monopoly prices.</P>
            <P>By such action we shall certainly be able to remove the element 
              of contributory causation on the part of the trusts and the tariff 
              towards the high cost of living. There will remain many other elements. 
              Wrong taxation, including failure to tax swollen inheritances and 
              unused land and other natural resources held for speculative purposes, 
              is one of these elements. The modern tendency to leave the country 
              for the town is another element; and exhaustion of the soil and 
              poor methods of raising and marketing the products of the soil make 
              up another element, as I have already shown. Another element is 
              that of waste and extravagance, individual and National. No laws 
              which the wit of man call devise will avail to make the community 
              prosperous if the average individual lives in such fashion that 
              his expenditure always exceeds his income.</P>
            <P>National extravagance--that is, the expenditure of money which 
              is not warranted--we can ourselves control, and to some degree we 
              can help in doing away with the extravagance caused by international 
              rivalries.</P>
            <P>These are all definite methods by which something can be accomplished 
              in the direction of decreasing the cost of living. All taken together 
              will not fully meet the situation. There are in it elements which 
              as yet we do not understand. We can be certain that the remedy proposed 
              by the Democratic party is a quack remedy. It is just as emphatically 
              a quack remedy as was the quack remedy, the panacea, the universal 
              cure-all which they proposed sixteen years ago. It is instructive 
              to compare what they now say with what they said in 1896. Only sixteen 
              years ago they were telling us that the decrease in prices was fatal 
              to our people, that the fall in the production of gold, and, as 
              a consequence, the fall in the prices of commodities, was responsible 
              for our ills. Now they ascribe these ills to diametrically opposite 
              causes, such as the rise in the price of commodities. It may well 
              be that the immense output of gold during the last few years is 
              partly responsible for certain phases of the present trouble--which 
              is an instructive commentary on the wisdom of those men who sixteen 
              years ago insisted that the remedy for everything was to be found 
              in the mere additional output of coin, silver and gold alike. There 
              is no more curious delusion than that the Democratic platform is 
              a Progressive platform. The Democratic platform, representing the 
              best thought of the acknowledged Democratic leaders at Baltimore, 
              is purely retrogressive and reactionary. There is no progress in 
              it. It represents an effort to go back; to put this Nation of a 
              hundred millions, existing under modern conditions, back to where 
              it was as a Nation of twenty-five millions in the days of the stage-coach 
              and canal boat. Such an attitude is toryism, not Progressivism.</P>
            <P>In addition, then, to the remedies that we can begin forthwith, 
              there should be a fearless, intelligent, and searching inquiry into 
              the whole subject made by an absolutely non-partisan body of experts, 
              with no prejudices to warp their minds, no object to serve, who 
              shall recommend any necessary remedy, heedless of what interest 
              may be helped or hurt thereby, and caring only for the interests 
              of the people as a whole.</P>
            <P> 
            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">CURRENCY</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>We believe that there exists an imperative need for prompt legislation 
              for the improvement of our National currency system. The experience 
              of repeated financial crises in the last forty years has proved 
              that the present method of issuing, through private agencies, notes 
              secured by Government bonds is both harmful and unscientific. This 
              method was adopted as a means of financing the Government during 
              the Civil War through furnishing a domestic market for Government 
              bonds. It was largely successful in fulfilling that purpose; but 
              that need is long past, and the system has outlived this feature 
              of its usefulness. The issue of currency is fundamentally a governmental 
              function. The system to be adopted should have as its basic principles 
              soundness and elasticity. The currency should flow forth readily 
              at the demand of commercial activity, and retire as promptly when 
              the demand diminishes. It should be automatically sufficient for 
              all of the legitimate needs of business in any section of the country. 
              Only by such means can the country be freed from the danger of recurring 
              panics. The control should be lodged with the Government, and should 
              be safeguarded against manipulation by Wall Street or the large 
              interests. It should be made impossible to use the machinery or 
              perquisites of the currency system for any speculative purposes. 
              The country must be safeguarded against the overexpansion or unjust 
              contraction of either credit or circulating medium.</P>

            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">CONSERVATION</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>There can be no greater issue than that of Conservation in this 
              country. Just as we must conserve our men, women, and children, 
              so we must conserve the resources of the land on which they live. 
              We must conserve the soil so that our children shall have a land 
              that is more and not less fertile than that our fathers dwelt in. 
              We must conserve the forests, not by disuse but by use, making them 
              more valuable at the same time that we use them. We must conserve 
              the mines. Moreover, we must insure so far as possible the use of 
              certain types of great natural resources for the benefit of the 
              people as a whole. The public should not alienate its fee in the 
              water power which will be of incalculable consequence as a source 
              of power in the immediate future. The Nation and the States within 
              their several spheres should by immediate legislation keep the fee 
              of the water power, leasing its use only for a reasonable length 
              of time on terms that will secure the interests of the public. Just 
              as the Nation has gone into the work of irrigation in the West, 
              so it should go into the work of helping reclaim the swamp lands 
              of the South. We should undertake the complete development and control 
              of the Mississippi as a National work, just as we have undertaken 
              the work of building the Panama Canal. We can use the plant, and 
              we call use the human experience, left free by the completion of 
              the Panama Canal in so developing the Mississippi as to make it 
              a mighty highroad of commerce, and a source of fructification and 
              not of death to the rich and fertile lands lying along its lower 
              length.</P>
            <P>In the West, the forests, the grazing lands, the reserves of every 
              kind, should be so handled as to be in the interests of the actual 
              settler, the actual home-maker. He should be encouraged to use them 
              at once, but in such a way as to preserve and not exhaust them. 
              We do not intend that our natural resources shall be exploited by 
              the few against the interests of the many, nor do we intend to turn 
              them over to any man who will wastefully use them by destruction, 
              and leave to those who come after us a heritage damaged by just 
              so much. The man in whose interests we are working is the small 
              farmer and settler, the man who works with his own hands, who is 
              working not only for himself but for his children, and who wishes 
              to leave to them the fruits of his labor. His permanent welfare 
              is the prime factor for consideration in developing the policy of 
              Conservation; for our aim is to preserve our natural resources for 
              the public as a whole, for the average man and the average woman 
              who make up the body of the American people.</P>
            <P> 
            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">ALASKA</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>Alaska should be developed at once, but in the interest of the 
              actual settler. In Alaska the Government has an opportunity of starting 
              in what is almost a fresh field to work out various problems by 
              actual experiment. The Government should at once construct, own, 
              and operate the railways in Alaska. The Government should keep the 
              fee of all the coal-fields and allow them to be operated by lessees 
              with the condition in the lease that non-use shall operate as a 
              forfeit. Telegraph lines should be operated as the railways are. 
              Moreover, it would be well in Alaska to try a system of land taxation 
              which will, so far as possible, remove all the burdens from those 
              who actually use the land, whether for building or for agricultural 
              purposes, and will operate against any man who holds the land for 
              speculation, or derives an income from it based, not on his own 
              exertions, but on the increase in value due to activities not his 
              own. There is very real need that this Nation shall seriously prepare 
              itself for the task of remedying social injustice and meeting social 
              problems by well-considered governmental effort; and the best preparation 
              for such wise action is to test by actual experiment under favorable 
              conditions the device which we have reason to believe will work 
              well, but which it is difficult to apply in old settled communities 
              without preliminary experiment.</P>
            <P> 
            <P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>In international affairs this country should behave toward other 
              nations exactly as an honorable private citizen behaves toward other 
              private citizens. We should do no wrong to any nation, weak or strong, 
              and we should submit to no wrong. Above all, we should never in 
              any treaty make any promise which we do not intend in good faith 
              to fulfill. I believe it essential that our small army should be 
              kept at a high pitch of perfection, and in no way can it be so damaged 
              as by permitting it to become the plaything of men in Congress who 
              wish to gratify either spite or favoritism, or to secure to localities 
              advantages to which those localities are not entitled. The navy 
              should be steadily built up; and the process of up-building must 
              not be stopped until--and not before--it proves possible to secure 
              by international agreement a general reduction of armaments. The 
              Panama Canal must be fortified. It would have been criminal to build 
              it if we were not prepared to fortify it and to keep our navy at 
              such a pitch of strength as to render it unsafe for any foreign 
              power to attack us and get control of it. We have a perfect right 
              to permit our coastwise traffic (with which there can be no competition 
              by the merchant marine of any foreign nation--so that there is no 
              discrimination against any foreign marine) to pass through that 
              Canal on any terms we choose, and I personally think that no toll 
              should be charged on such traffic. Moreover, in time of war, where 
              all treaties between warring nations, save those connected with 
              the management of the war, at once lapse, the Canal would of course 
              be open to the use of our warships and closed to warships of the 
              nation with which we were engaged in hostilities. But at all times 
              the Canal should be opened on equal terms to the ships of all nations, 
              including our own engaged in international commerce. That was the 
              understanding of the treaty when it was adopted, and the United 
              States must always, as a matter of honorable obligation and with 
              scrupulous nicety, live up to every understanding which she has 
              entered into with any foreign Power.</P>
            <P>The question that has arisen over the right of this Nation to charge 
              tolls on the Canal vividly illustrates the folly and iniquity of 
              making treaties which cannot and ought not to be kept. As a people 
              there is no lesson we more need to learn than the lesson not in 
              an outburst of emotionalism to make a treaty that ought not to be, 
              and could not be, kept; and the further lesson that, when we do 
              make a treaty, we must soberly live up to it as long as changed 
              conditions do not warrant the serious step of denouncing it. If 
              we had been so unwise as to adopt the general arbitration treaties 
              a few months ago, we would now be bound to arbitrate the question 
              of our right to free our own coastwise traffic from Canal tolls; 
              and at any future time we might have found ourselves obliged to 
              arbitrate the question whether, in the event of war, we could keep 
              the Canal open to our own war vessels and closed to those of our 
              foes. There could be no better illustration of the extreme unwisdom 
              of entering into international agreements without paying heed to 
              the question of keeping them. On the other hand, we deliberately, 
              and with our eyes open, and after ample consideration and discussion, 
              agreed to treat all merchant ships on the same basis; it was partly 
              because of this agreement that there was no question raised by foreign 
              nations' as to our digging and fortifying the Canal; and, having 
              given our word, we must keep it. When the American people make a 
              promise, that promise must and will be kept.</P>
            <P> <BR>
              <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#990000">CONCLUSION</FONT></STRONG></P>
            <P>Now, friends, this is my confession of faith. I have made it rather 
              long because I wish you to know just what my deepest convictions 
              are on the great questions of today, so that if you choose to make 
              me your standard-bearer in the fight you shall make your choice 
              understanding exactly how I feel--and if, after hearing me, you 
              think you ought to choose some one else, I shall loyally abide by 
              your choice. The convictions to which I have come have not been 
              arrived at as the result of study in the closet or the library. 
              but from the knowledge I have gained through hard experience during 
              the many years in which, under many and varied conditions, I have 
              striven and toiled with men. I believe in a larger use of the governmental 
              power to help remedy industrial wrongs, because it has been borne 
              in on me by actual experience that without the exercise of such 
              power many of the wrongs will go unremedied. I believe in a larger 
              opportunity for the people themselves directly to participate in 
              government and to control their governmental agents, because long 
              experience has taught me that without such control many of their 
              agents will represent them badly. By actual experience in office 
              I have found that, as a rule, I could secure the triumph of the 
              causes in which I most believed, not from the politicians and the 
              men who claim an exceptional right to speak in business and government, 
              but by going over their heads and appealing directly to the people 
              themselves. I am not under the slightest delusion as to any power 
              that during my political career I have at any time possessed. Whatever 
              of power I at any time had, I obtained from the people. I could 
              exercise it only so long as, and to the extent that, the people 
              not merely believed in me, but heartily backed me up. Whatever I 
              did as President I was able to do only because I had the backing 
              of the people. When on any point I did not have that backing, when 
              on any point I differed from the people, it mattered not whether 
              I was right or whether I was wrong, my power vanished. I tried my 
              best to lead the people, to advise them, to tell them what I thought 
              was right; if necessary, I never hesitated to tell them what I thought 
              they ought to hear, even though I thought it would be unpleasant 
              for them to hear it; but I recognized that my task was to try to 
              lead them and not to drive them, to take them into my confidence, 
              to try to show them that I was right, and then loyally and in good 
              faith to accept their decision. I will do anything for the people 
              except what my conscience tells me is wrong, and that I can do for 
              no man and no set of men; I hold that a man cannot serve the people 
              well unless he serves his conscience; but I hold also that where 
              his conscience bids him refuse to do what the people desire, he 
              should not try to continue in office against their will. Our Government 
              system should be so shaped that the public servant, when he cannot 
              conscientiously carry out the wishes of the people, shall at their 
              desire leave his office and not misrepresent them in office; and 
              I hold that the public servant can by so doing, better than in any 
              other way, serve both them and his conscience.</P>
            <P>Surely there never was a fight better worth making than the one 
              in which we are engaged. It little matters what befalls any one 
              of us who for the time being stand in the forefront of the battle. 
              I hope we shall win, and I believe that if we can wake the people 
              to what the fight really means we shall win. But, win or lose, we 
              shall not falter. Whatever fate may at the moment overtake any of 
              us, the movement itself will not stop. Our cause is based on the 
              eternal principles of righteousness; and even though we who now 
              lead may for the time fail, in the end the cause itself shall triumph. 
              Six weeks ago, here in Chicago, I spoke to the honest representatives 
              of a Convention which was not dominated by honest men; a Convention 
              wherein sat, alas! a majority of men who, with sneering indifference 
              to every principle of right, so acted as to bring to a shameful 
              end a party which had been founded over half a century ago by men 
              in whose souls burned the fire of lofty endeavor. Now to you men, 
              who, in your turn, have corne together to spend and be spent in 
              the endless crusade against wrong, to you who face the future resolute 
              and confident, to you who strive in a spirit of brotherhood for 
              the betterment of our Nation, to you who gird yourselves for this 
              great new fight in the never-ending warfare for the good of humankind, 
              I say in closing what in that speech I said in closing: We stand 
              at Arrnageddon, and we battle for the Lord. </TD>
