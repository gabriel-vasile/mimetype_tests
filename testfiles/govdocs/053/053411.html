BACKGROUND<br><br>                    During a  two-month trial  in the  district court,  the<br><br>          government mined a golconda of  evidence.  Because it would serve<br><br>          no useful purpose to recount the occasionally ponderous record in<br><br>          book and  verse, we  offer instead an  overview of  the evidence,<br><br>          taken in the light most compatible with the guilty verdicts.  See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          United States  v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.<br>          _____________     _____                                     _____<br><br>          denied, 113  S. Ct. 1005 (1993).  Further  facts will be added as<br>          ______<br><br>          we discuss specific issues.<br><br>                    For  almost  six  years, David  Sepulveda  conducted an<br><br>          increasingly sophisticated  cocaine distribution business  in and<br><br>          around Manchester, New Hampshire.  Initially, Sepulveda purchased<br><br>          cocaine from  a vendor in Nashua, New  Hampshire, and transported<br><br>          it  to Manchester  himself.   Over time,  Sepulveda expanded  his<br><br>          operation, increasing the  volume of cocaine and  engaging others<br><br>          to handle tasks such as pickup, delivery, and street-level sales.<br><br>                    As his  enterprise grew more ambitious, Sepulveda began<br><br>          purchasing  cocaine from  a  source  in Lawrence,  Massachusetts.<br><br>          Faced with the  need to retain  control while insulating  himself<br><br>          from  the prying eyes  of law enforcement  personnel, Sepulveda's<br><br>          journeys to Lawrence became an elaborate ritual in which he would<br><br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          scrupulously avoid carrying  drugs or travelling in  the same car<br><br>          with the cocaine that he purchased.  On these provisioning trips,<br><br>          Sepulveda was usually  accompanied by his  brother, Edgar, and  a<br><br>          "runner," that is, an individual who would actually transport the<br><br>          cocaine  from  Lawrence  to  Manchester.1    Frequently,  one  of<br><br>          Sepulveda's  distributors  or a  user  in a  particular  hurry to<br><br>          obtain fresh supplies would join the troupe.<br><br>                    Once the cocaine arrived  in Manchester, Sepulveda  and<br><br>          his  associates  packaged  it   in  street-level  quantities  and<br><br>          distributed it to a series of individuals for resale and personal<br><br>          use.   The buyers included,  among others,  defendants Edward  W.<br><br>          Welch,  Jr., Arline  S.  Welch,  Shane  Welch,  Kevin  Cullinane,<br><br>          Christopher Driesse, Cheryl  T. Johnson, Richard E.  Labrie, Tony<br><br>          Rood, and William D. Wallace.  David Sepulveda made a practice of<br><br>          directing  persons who inquired about purchasing small amounts of<br><br>          cocaine to these same individuals.<br><br>                    Eventually, David Sepulveda's reach exceeded his grasp.<br><br>          A federal  grand jury indicted  him, along with others,  for drug<br><br>          trafficking;  and, after  trial, a  petit  jury convicted  twelve<br><br>          persons,  viz.,  the  Sepulveda  brothers,  the  three   Welches,<br>                    ____<br><br>          Cullinane, Driesse, Johnson, Labrie, Rood, Wallace, and Langlois,<br><br>          on a charge of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          21 U.S.C.    846 (1988).  The jury also convicted David Sepulveda<br><br>          on a charge of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.  See<br>                                                                        ___<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1At  various times,  defendants  Tony  Rood  and  Ernest  F.<br>          Langlois  worked as  runners.   At  other  times, Norberto  Perez<br>          played this role.<br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          21 U.S.C.   848 (1988).  Twenty-six appeals ensued.<br><br>                    It  is  no  exaggeration to  say  that  the defendants,<br><br>          represented by able  counsel, managed to cultivate a profusion of<br><br>          variegated  grounds for appeal  from the  peat of  the protracted<br><br>          trial.    Because  of  the  sheer  bulk  and  complexity  of  the<br><br>          proceedings, we issued  a special briefing  order and then  heard<br><br>          oral argument on all twenty-six  appeals.  We decide today twelve<br><br>          appeals   taken    by   ten   defendants    (collectively,   "the<br><br>          appellants").2  After sifting what  grains we can locate from the<br><br>          considerable chaff,  we conclude  that the  appellants enjoyed  a<br><br>          fair, substantially error-free trial, and  that their convictions<br><br>          must  stand.   In two  instances, however,  we  vacate particular<br><br>          sentences and remand for further proceedings.<br><br>          II.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE<br>          II.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE<br><br>                    Four   appellants   claim   that    the   evidence   is<br><br>          insufficient,  as a matter of law, to support their convictions.3<br><br>          Because insufficiency claims are commonplace in criminal appeals,<br><br>          the   standard  of  appellate  oversight  lends  itself  to  rote<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2The  appeals taken  by defendants  Christopher Driesse  and<br>          Shane Welch following the trial present certain unique issues and<br>          those two  appeals will  be resolved in  a separate opinion.

Santos  also testified  that Cullinane  accompanied<br><br>          Sepulveda on provisioning trips, returning to  Santos's apartment<br><br>          with fresh supplies of contraband.  The ubiquitous Norberto Perez<br><br>          corroborated  this relationship, testifying that he had travelled<br><br>          to  Lawrence  on  at  least  five occasions  in  the  company  of<br><br>          Cullinane  and the  Sepulveda  siblings  in  order  to  replenish<br><br>          cocaine stores.

Langlois's  resounding success  in the<br><br>          latter  role    intimidating Sepulveda's debtors  and, sometimes,<br><br>          his  associates    produced  a  suffusion  of  testimony  limning<br><br>          Langlois's role in  the organization.   For instance, David  Hill<br><br>          described four occasions on which Langlois used force, or threats<br><br>          of  force,  to  collect  debts  owed to  Sepulveda.    Two  other<br><br>          witnesses testified that Sepulveda boasted of  employing Langlois<br><br>          as a strongarm to collect  drug debts.  Another witness overheard<br><br>          Langlois  crowing about  the nature  of his  employment.   And no<br><br>          fewer  than  six  witnesses  relayed  information  from  which  a<br><br>          rational jury  could infer  that Langlois  "rode shotgun"  during<br><br>          drug-buying expeditions.<br><br>                    As  this  partial   summary  indicates,  the   evidence<br><br>          accumulated  against Langlois rose well above the level necessary<br><br>          to sustain the jury's verdict.<br><br>                                 D.

On one hand, the rule cabins<br><br>          the judge's discretion by affording  all parties a right to close<br>                                                             _____<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               8To recognize that the record  sheds no light on the factual<br>          underpinnings of the  sequestration dispute is not to  imply that<br>          the  defense lacked  opportunity to  explore  the possibility  of<br>          sequestration  violations.

Sequestration and Cohabitation.<br>                             ______________________________<br><br>                    Here,  appellants   moved  in  advance  of   trial  for<br><br>          sequestration  without  indicating  to the  court  what  level of<br><br>          restraint they thought appropriate.  The court granted the motion<br><br>          in   its  simplest   aspect,   directing  counsel   "to   monitor<br><br>          sequestration"  and ordering "that  witnesses who are  subject to<br><br>          [the court's] order are not to be present in the courtroom at any<br><br>          time prior to  their appearance to render testimony."   At trial,<br><br>          the district court expanded its earlier order beyond the Rule 615<br><br>          minimum,  instructing each  witness at  the close  of his  or her<br><br>          testimony  not to discuss that  testimony with any other witness.<br><br>          Appellants accepted the conditions of sequestration described  by<br><br>          the court  without demurrer.  What is  more, they did not request<br><br>          any further instructions, say, that witnesses  be directed at the<br><br>          end of each  day, or  before each  recess, not  to discuss  their<br><br>          testimony.    Thus,  every  witness was  placed  under  an  order<br><br>          prohibiting discussion of the case with other witnesses only upon<br><br>          the completion of his or her testimony.<br><br>                    On these facts,  the district court's denial  of relief<br><br>          must be  upheld.   The court's  basic sequestration order,  which<br><br>          ploughed a straight furrow in line with Rule 615  itself, did not<br><br>          extend beyond the  courtroom.  There has been  no intimation that<br><br>          the witnesses  transgressed this  order.   Moreover, because  the<br><br>          district  court  did   not  promulgate  a  non-discussion   order<br><br>          applicable to any witness until  the conclusion of that witness's<br><br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          testimony,  Perez, Milne, and  Coriaty were under  no obligation,<br><br>          prior   to  that  moment,   to  refrain  from   discussing  their<br><br>          recollections with  each other.   Finally,  there is no  evidence<br><br>          that any of  the three ever chatted  about the case  with another<br><br>          witness after having been admonished to the  contrary   or at any<br><br>          earlier time, for that matter.<br><br>                    Given this predicate, appellants' plaint reduces to the<br><br>          unprecedented proposition  that witness  cohabitation constitutes<br><br>          an automatic violation  of a standard  sequestration order.   The<br><br>          crux   of  sequestration,   however,  is   communication  between<br><br>          witnesses,  not shared  accommodations  or geographic  proximity.<br><br>          Social  settings, such as communal  housing or common work sites,<br><br>          may offer opportunities for witnesses to compare notes and gossip<br><br>          about their testimony, but  such environments do not ensure  that<br><br>          forbidden  conversations will occur.   We assume  that witnesses,<br><br>          like all other  persons subject to court orders,  will follow the<br><br>          instructions they receive.   Cf., e.g., Richardson  v. Marsh, 481<br>                                       ___  ____  __________     _____<br><br>          U.S. 200, 206  (1987) (reiterating the "invariable  assumption of<br><br>          the law  that jurors follow  their instructions").   We conclude,<br><br>          therefore, that  the housing arrangement,  in and of  itself, did<br><br>          not violate an existing sequestration order.<br><br>                    If  doubt inhered    and we see  no room for  any   two<br><br>          other considerations would then be decisive.  In the first place,<br><br>          a district court's interpretation of its own order is customarily<br><br>          accorded great weight.  See, e.g., Witty v.

Here,  the district court ruled that congregant<br><br>          housing of witnesses did not  infringe on the sequestration  that<br><br>          it decreed.  When a trial court's interpretation of its own order<br><br>          tracks plain language  and the  actual sequence  of events,  that<br><br>          interpretation must be honored on appeal.<br><br>                    In  the  second place,  even  if  some implied  ban  on<br><br>          congregant  housing of  prisoner-witnesses existed,  breach of  a<br><br>          sequestration order would not automatically call for a new trial;<br><br>          rather,  the need  for  a sanction,  and  the nature  of one,  if<br><br>          imposable,  are  matters  committed to  the  trial  court's sound<br><br>          discretion.  See United States v.  Rossetti, 768 F.2d 12, 16 (1st<br>                       ___ _____________     ________<br><br>          Cir.  1985); Arruda,  715 F.2d  at 684.   Appellants'  failure to<br>                       ______<br><br>          request  a   broader  sequestration   order,  coupled  with   the<br><br>          speculative nature of their claim of actual prejudice, renders it<br><br>          impossible  to find  an abuse  of  discretion here.   See,  e.g.,<br>                                                                ___   ____<br><br>          Rossetti, 768 F.2d at 16.<br>          ________<br><br>                    To  sum up,  our  search  of the  record  in this  case<br><br>          discloses  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  government or  its<br><br>          witnesses  transgressed the existing sequestration order.  And as<br><br>          we   have  indicated,  if  appellants  desired  a  more  vigorous<br><br>          sequestration  regime, such  as an  edict that would  have banned<br><br>          cohabitation or  other contact  amongst prisoner-witnesses,  they<br><br>          had a  duty to ask for  it.  They failed  to do so.

Because  the district  judge is  better<br>               ____ _____<br><br>          attuned to  the  nuances of  the trial,  this court  must take  a<br><br>          deferential view of rulings made in the course of that patrol.<br><br>                    When discovery  material makes a belated  appearance, a<br><br>          criminal  defendant  must  ordinarily seek  a  continuance  if he<br><br>          intends to claim prejudice.   A continuance affords time to study<br><br>          the   newly   emergent   information,   consider   its   possible<br><br>          ramifications, change trial  strategy (if necessary),  assess any<br><br>          potential   prejudice,  and  determine   how  best  to   use  the<br><br>          information.  As a general rule, a defendant who does not request<br><br>          a  continuance will not  be heard to  complain on appeal  that he<br><br>          suffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving discovery.

In  every instance  save<br><br>          one, appellants eschewed a request  for a continuance.  They have<br><br>          never satisfactorily  explained how  delays in production  caused<br><br>          them  any  cognizable harm  on  those several  occasions  and the<br><br>          record,  which  reflects  that  appellants  assimilated  the  new<br><br>          material without  any  perceptible  hitch  and used  it  to  good<br><br>          effect,  belies  any  such  claim.    The  lack  of  demonstrable<br><br>          prejudice sounds the death knell for a "delayed discovery" claim.<br><br>          See United States  v.

Hence,  we  find  appellants' delayed  discovery<br><br>          claims, with one exception, to have been waived.<br><br>                    The   facts   referable  to   the   remaining  dilatory<br><br>          disclosure  claim can be  succinctly summarized.   Perez not only<br><br>          worked as a  courier for David Sepulveda, but  also supported his<br><br>          own cocaine  habit by peddling  drugs.  After he  was apprehended<br><br>          for selling cocaine,  Perez agreed to testify  against appellants<br><br>          in  return for  the United  States Attorney's  help in  seeking a<br><br><br>                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          reduced sentence.   Since Perez was the only witness who tied all<br><br>          the  defendants  to  David Sepulveda's  illicit  enterprise,  his<br><br>          testimony was extremely important to the government's case.<br><br>                    When  defense lawyers  began cross-examining  Perez, it<br><br>          became  apparent that  the  FBI  records  furnished  in  pretrial<br><br>          discovery  did not  list Perez's  entire  repertoire of  criminal<br><br>          convictions,   especially  those   stemming   from  state   court<br><br>          proceedings and not reported to the FBI.  When Perez acknowledged<br><br>          that a state probation officer had prepared a presentence  report<br><br>          for a New Hampshire court,  appellants asked for a continuance so<br><br>          that  they might  obtain  this document  and more  fully research<br><br>          Perez's  criminal history.  The  district court denied the motion<br><br>          but offered  to permit  the defense to  recall Perez  for further<br><br>          cross-questioning should  the new  information warrant  it.   The<br><br>          trial continued coincident  with the defense's efforts  to secure<br><br>          the presentence report.<br><br>                    After some travail, New Hampshire authorities agreed to<br><br>          release the report to  the federal court in camera.

The judge<br><br>          refused to grant a mistrial  or afford appellants any  comparable<br><br>          redress.<br><br>                    We see no error.  The  prosecution was caught unawares;<br><br>          it never knew of the report's existence and, therefore, could not<br><br>          have deliberately withheld it.   Furthermore, the rigors of Brady<br>                                                                      _____<br><br><br>                                          22<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          do  not   usually  attach   to  material   outside  the   federal<br><br>          government's  control   and the presentence  report at issue here<br><br>          falls within  the scope  of this generality.

Moreover, the  timing of<br><br>          events  minimized  the  possibility  of  prejudice.    Appellants<br><br>          received the report while Perez  was still testifying.

The common thread that joins<br><br>          these proffers is that the government adduced some other evidence<br><br>          tending   to   prove   that  the   declarants   were,   in  fact,<br><br>          coconspirators.

Inasmuch as that statement implicated Driesse alone,<br>          we regard the  ensuing assignment of error as beyond the scope of<br>          this opinion.

Milne  Testimony.<br>                           ________________<br><br>          coconspirator) served as  the wellspring of the  first statement.<br><br>          He testified  that a defendant,  Edward Welch, told him  that the<br><br>          police  noticed cocaine  on his  (Welch's) bed  in the  course of<br><br>          executing a  search warrant.   The district court found  that the<br><br>          declarant, Welch, was a coconspirator, and that Welch's statement<br><br>          was  made during  and  in  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.   The<br><br>          finding is fully sustainable.<br><br>                    Both Coriaty and  Milne testified that Welch  sold them<br><br>          cocaine he  had purchased  from David  Sepulveda (an  arrangement<br><br>          that  numerous  other  witnesses  corroborated).   This  evidence<br><br>          encourages,  if it  does not  demand, the  conclusion  that Welch<br><br>          worked hand  in glove with  Sepulveda.   A pattern of  drug sales<br><br>          between  two individuals, looking toward resale to third persons,<br><br>          together  with  appropriate  contextual  detail,  can  support  a<br><br>          finding that the two individuals were jointly involved in a drug-<br><br>          trafficking conspiracy.

The  record likewise  justifies  the<br><br>          conclusion that Welch's statements to Milne were made  during and<br><br>          in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We think it is common ground  <br><br>          and common  sense   that  the reporting of significant  events by<br><br>          one coconspirator to another advances the conspiracy.

She testified<br><br>          that David Sepulveda's inamorata, Bambi Burley, told her that she<br><br>          (Bambi) had  jilted Sepulveda and  asked whether Malone  might be<br><br>          "one of those girls that went to  New York with him."  Appellants<br><br>          challenge the admission of this statement on the sole ground that<br><br>          Burley,  herself, was  a  stranger  to  the  charged  conspiracy.<br><br>          However,  this  challenge  overlooks  Perez's testimony  that  he<br><br>          collected drug debts for David  Sepulveda and delivered the money<br><br>          to  Burley.   While  there  is  hardly  a profusion  of  evidence<br><br>          depicting Burley as a coconspirator, there is enough to withstand<br><br>          clear error review.12<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               12It seems  problematic whether  these statements  furthered<br>          the  conspiracy.   We need  not mull  this question,  however, as<br>          appellants did not advance this  ground either in the lower court<br>          or in their briefs.  The issue is, therefore, waived.

In  each<br><br>          instance, there appears to be  no record evidence, other than the<br><br>          statement itself, to support its admissibility.<br><br>                    One statement arose during the government's examination<br><br>          of  a police  detective, Mark  Putney.   The detective  testified<br><br>          that, while executing a search  warrant at a dwelling occupied by<br><br>          defendant Cheryl Johnson and her  husband, Brian, he answered the<br><br>          telephone:<br><br>                    The  male caller asked if  Brian was home.

I stated sure, come on over.<br><br>                    The other statement occurred  during direct examination<br><br>          of  Joseph  Baranski.    Baranski  testified  that  he  sometimes<br><br>          provided  transportation for  people going  to David  Sepulveda's<br><br>          house and that,  on occasion, his passengers would  tell him that<br><br>          they were  visiting Sepulveda  because "they  wanted to  buy some<br><br>          drugs."<br><br>                    Our  review of the  record has deterrated  no extrinsic<br><br>          evidence  tending to show that these out-of-court declarants (the<br><br>          unidentified caller to the Johnson residence and the unidentified<br><br>          passengers   in  Baranski's   vehicle)  were   involved  in   the<br><br>          conspiracy, and the government has  directed us to no such proof.<br><br>          Following  the Supreme Court's landmark opinion in Bourjaily, and<br>                                                             _________<br><br><br>                                          29<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Justice Stevens's concurrence, 483 U.S.  at 185 & n.2, several of<br><br>          our  sister circuits  have concluded  that  the preponderance  of<br><br>          evidence  required  for  the   introduction  of  an  out-of-court<br><br>          statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) must  necessarily comprise more<br><br>          than  the weight  of the  statement  itself.

Despite this  promising start,<br><br>          matters  soon deteriorated.    Although Commander  Gerry  offered<br><br>          opinions   as   to   appellants'   roles   in   the   enterprise,<br><br>          characterizing David  Sepulveda as  "top dog"  and the  others as<br><br>          rank-and-file  members  of  the  organization,  cross-examination<br><br>          revealed that  these opinions  were less the  fruit of  an expert<br><br>          mind  attuned to  the  testimony in  the case  than the  yield of<br><br>          undifferentiated conversations over  the years with  unidentified<br><br>          police  officers  regarding  Sepulveda and  his  associates.   So<br><br>          ingrained were  the roots of  Commander Gerry's opinions  that he<br><br>          was unable to specify the sources  of his information or, in  the<br><br>          end, articulate a plausible basis for his views.  The speculative<br><br>          nature  of Gerry's  testimony became  starkly  apparent when  the<br><br>          defense established that he had heard only bits and pieces of the<br><br>          testimony  in the  case.   These rather  startling insights  cast<br><br>          grave doubt  upon both  the adequacy of  the foundation  on which<br><br>          Gerry's testimony rested  and the existence of a fair opportunity<br><br>          for effective cross-questioning.<br><br>                    Midway through  cross-examination the defense  moved to<br><br>          strike  the  expert's  testimony in  toto.

Declaring<br><br>          a mistrial is  a last resort, only to be implemented if the taint<br><br>          is ineradicable, that  is, only if the trial  judge believes that<br><br>          the jury's  exposure to  the evidence is  likely to  prove beyond<br><br>          realistic hope of repair.<br><br><br>                                          37<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In this  instance, Judge  Devine followed the  standard<br><br>          paradigm as closely as possible, considering appellants' delay in<br><br>          offering the mistrial motion.   Three factors persuade us that he<br><br>          handled  the situation in  an appropriate manner.   First, courts<br><br>          have long recognized that, within wide margins, the potential for<br><br>          prejudice stemming  from improper  testimony or  comments can  be<br><br>          satisfactorily  dispelled by  appropriate curative  instructions.<br><br>          See, e.g.,  United States v.

Swiftness<br><br>          in  judicial  response  is an  important  element  in alleviating<br><br>          prejudice once the  jury has been exposed  to improper testimony.<br><br>          See,  e.g., United  States v.

The<br><br>          testimony is virtually  indistinguishable from the vast  array of<br><br>          other  evidence introduced by the prosecution, and, therefore, it<br><br>          is  of  the  cumulative  vintage.16    We  have  routinely  found<br><br>          cumulative evidence  impotent when  accidentally uncorked.

So it is<br>                               _____ ______<br><br>          here.   Appellants have not successfully rebutted the presumption<br><br>          that the jury heeded the judge's instructions.<br><br>                    In a last-ditch effort to save the day, appellants come<br><br>          at the question  of undue prejudice from a  slightly more oblique<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               16It  is,  perhaps,  worth noting  that  the  only defendant<br>          discussed in  any detail by the  witness was David Sepulveda    a<br>          defendant   as  to  whom  the  prosecution  adduced  overwhelming<br>          evidence of  guilt.  We  add that, although there  were different<br>          quanta of evidence as to  each defendant, a painstaking review of<br>          the  record inspires  confidence that  Gerry's  testimony had  no<br>          significant spillover effect vis-a-vis other defendants.<br><br>                                          39<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          angle.     They  allege  that  the  government's  questioning  of<br><br>          Commander Gerry went  so far beyond the limits  of propriety that<br><br>          putting  him on  the  witness  stand  amounted  to  prosecutorial<br><br>          misconduct.    But  the  record  simply  does  not  support  this<br><br>          accusation.  The government  had a reasonable basis for  offering<br><br>          Gerry as an expert  witness.  Although  the decision did not  pan<br><br>          out, that is no  reason to consign either  the prosecutor or  the<br><br>          prosecution to the juridical equivalent of  philotheoparoptesism.<br><br>          Like judges,  prosecutors cannot be  held to a standard  of utter<br><br>          prescience.17 <br><br>                    For these reasons, we discern no abuse of discretion in<br><br>          either  the  district  court's  initial  admission  of  Commander<br><br>          Gerry's  testimony or the  court's refusal to  declare a mistrial<br><br>          after  the  necessity  to  strike  the testimony  arose.    In  a<br><br>          nutshell, there was no reason to  believe that the infelicitously<br><br>          offered evidence  remained  in the  jurors'  minds after  it  was<br><br>          banished from the case, and,  consequently, no need for the court<br><br>          to jettison the baby when the bath water turned tepid.<br><br><br><br>          VII.

The ancient adage applies:  what is sauce<br><br>          for the  government's goose often may  prove to be sauce  for the<br><br>          defendants' gander.<br><br>                    Although we  deplore frank  appeals to  passion of  the<br><br>          sort  typified by "war  on drugs"  rhetoric, see,  e.g., Arrieta-<br>                                                       ___   ____  ________<br><br>          Agressot, 3 F.3d at 527, we regard it as settled  that references<br>          ________<br><br>          to law enforcement efforts are not forbidden in summation if such<br><br>          references are  incited  or invited  by,  or fairly  respond  to,<br><br>          defendants' closing  statements.  See,  e.g., Smith, 918  F.2d at<br>                                            ___   ____  _____<br><br>          1563; United States v.

Discouraging  Sympathy.<br>                          ______________________<br><br>          reasons, we  find the  final challenged  statement, quoted  supra<br>                                                                      _____<br><br>          note  23,  to fall  within the  pale.   Viewed  in  context, this<br><br>          statement,  which questioned whether an acquittal out of sympathy<br><br>          would  be in  the  community  interest, was  made  to dampen  the<br><br>          defense's  flirtation with  jury  nullification (described  infra<br>                                                                      _____<br><br>          Part VIII).   Courts should  allow prosecutors greater  leeway in<br><br>          rebuttal  when the defense has  itself breached the standards for<br><br>          proper summation.   See  Young, 470  U.S. at  11; Lawn  v.

Applying this offshoot of the goose-and-gander principle,<br><br>          we  hold that  the challenged  comment did  not constitute  plain<br><br>          error.<br><br>          VIII.  JURY NULLIFICATION<br>          VIII.  JURY NULLIFICATION<br><br>                    The   defendants   invoked   the   specter   of    jury<br><br>          nullification  during  final  arguments.    Labrie's  lawyer,  in<br><br>          particular, invited the jury to "send out  a question" concerning<br><br>          this doctrine.  Three non-events followed; the government did not<br><br>          object to this  soliloquy, the district  court did not  intervene<br><br>          sua sponte,  and the court's  charge did not broach  the subject.<br>          ___ ______<br><br>          Nevertheless, the deliberating jury took the invitation literally<br><br><br>                                          50<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          and asked the judge to "[c]larify the law on jury nullification."<br><br>          The court responded by telling the jury:<br><br>                    Federal   trial  judges   are  forbidden   to<br>                    instruct on jury  nullification, because they<br>                    are  required  to instruct  only  on  the law<br>                    which applies to a case.  As I have indicated<br>                    to  you, the burden in each instance which is<br>                    here placed  upon the Government is  to prove<br>                    each element of the  offenses . . .  beyond a<br>                    reasonable  doubt,  and  in  the  event   the<br>                    Government  fails to  sustain  its burden  of<br>                    proof  beyond  a reasonable  doubt as  to any<br>                    essential  element  of  any  offense  charged<br>                    against each defendant, it has then failed in<br>                    its  burden of proof as to such defendant and<br>                    that defendant is to be acquitted.  In short,<br>                    if the Government proves its case against any<br>                    defendant, you should convict that defendant.<br>                    If it  fails to  prove its  case against  any<br>                    defendant you must acquit that defendant.<br><br>          Appellants objected to  this supplemental instruction.   They now<br><br>          argue that the instruction amounted to a wrongful repudiation  of<br><br>          the time-honored concept of jury nullification.<br><br>                    The  applicable rule is  that, although  jurors possess<br><br>          the  raw power to set  an accused free  for any reason  or for no<br><br>          reason, their duty is  to apply the law as  given to them by  the<br><br>          court.  See   United States v.  Boardman, 419 F.2d 110,  116 (1st<br>                  ___   _____________     ________<br><br>          Cir.  1969),  cert. denied,  397 U.S.  991 (1970).   Accordingly,<br>                        _____ ______<br><br>          while jurors may choose to  flex their muscles, ignoring both law<br><br>          and evidence in  a gadarene rush to acquit  a criminal defendant,<br><br>          neither the court nor counsel should encourage jurors to exercise<br><br>          this power.   See United  States v. Trujillo,  714 F.2d 102,  106<br>                        ___ ______________    ________<br><br>          (11th Cir.  1983).  A  trial judge, therefore, may  block defense<br><br>          attorneys' attempts  to serenade  a jury with  the siren  song of<br><br>          nullification,  see United States  v. Garcia-Rosa, 876  F.2d 209,<br>                          ___ _____________     ___________<br><br>                                          51<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          226 (1st  Cir. 1989); and, indeed,  may instruct the  jury on the<br><br>          dimensions of their duty to the exclusion of  jury nullification,<br><br>          see Trujillo, 714 F.2d at 105-06 (collecting cases).<br>          ___ ________<br><br>                    To the extent that appellants, during closing argument,<br><br>          managed to  mention nullification,  they received  more than  was<br><br>          their  due.    Having  pocketed  this  gratuity,  appellants  now<br><br>          complain that they were  not allowed to capitalize  on it.   When<br><br>          the jurors rose to the  bait, appellants say, Judge Devine should<br><br>          have   assured  them   that  nullification   is  an   "historical<br><br>          prerogative"  of juries  from  time  immemorial.    We  disagree.<br><br>          Though jury nullification has a long and sometimes  storied past,<br><br>          see Boardman, 419  F.2d at 116, the  case law makes plain  that a<br>          ___ ________<br><br>          judge may not  instruct the jury anent its  history, vitality, or<br><br>          use.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d  347, 350<br>                ___   ____  _____________     _________<br><br>          (1st  Cir.  1991)  (collecting  cases).    This  proscription  is<br><br>          invariant; it makes no difference that the jury inquired, or that<br><br>          an  aggressive  lawyer  managed  to  pique  a  particular  jury's<br><br>          curiosity by mentioning the subject in closing argument, or  that<br><br>          a napping prosecutor  failed to raise a timely  objection to that<br><br>          allusion.    Thus,  the  district  court  appropriately  scotched<br><br>          appellants' suggested jury instruction.<br><br>                    Appellants'  fallback  position     that  the  district<br><br>          court, if  disinclined to sing the praises of jury nullification,<br><br>          should have  refrained from  giving any  supplemental instruction<br><br>          and,  instead, should have  stonewalled   is  not well conceived.<br><br>          The objection  focuses on  the district  court's opening  comment<br><br><br>                                          52<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          that "[f]ederal  trial judges are  forbidden to instruct  on jury<br><br>          nullification,"  interpreting  this  as  a  judicial  prohibition<br><br>          against  the jury's  use of  its inherent  power.   The objection<br><br>          fails for  several reasons,  most noticeably  because the  quoted<br><br>          statement conveys no such chilling effect.<br><br>                    Taken  literally, the  judge's  comment is  an accurate<br><br>          recitation of the law and  an appropriate rejoinder to the jury's<br><br>          question on  nullification (a question that appellants prompted).<br><br>          The district court  explained why it could not  answer the jury's<br><br>          request for more information on nullification.  The court went on<br><br>          to  repeat its earlier instruction that  if the government proved<br><br>          its  case  the jury  "should"  convict, while  if  the government<br><br>          failed to carry its burden the jury "must" acquit.  This contrast<br><br>          in directives, together with  the court's refusal to instruct  in<br><br>          any  detail  about  the  doctrine  of  jury  nullification,  left<br><br>          pregnant the possibility that the jury could ignore the law if it<br><br>          so chose.  Whether the jury perceived this possibility or not, no<br><br>          error infiltrated the court's supplemental instruction.<br><br>          IX.

VARIANCE BETWEEN INDICTMENT AND PROOF<br><br>                    Appellants Edgar Sepulveda and Tony Rood now claim that<br><br>          the  district court should have  acquitted them because they were<br><br>          not part  of the charged  conspiracy.  We review  their claims to<br><br>          determine whether  there is  sufficient evidence  to support  the<br><br>          jury's verdict.  See David, 940 F.2d at 732.  We conclude that  a<br>                           ___ _____<br><br>          rational  jury  could find,  as  this  jury  did, that  a  single<br><br>          conspiracy  existed, and that  the two objectors  participated in<br><br><br>                                          53<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          it.<br><br>                    We start with bedrock.  Ordinarily, questions anent the<br><br>          number  and structure  of conspiracies  present  matters of  fact<br><br>          suitable for  resolution by  a jury.

Of  course, the  jury's  inquiry is  guided by  certain<br><br>          principles.   For  example, in  a  unitary conspiracy  it is  not<br><br>          necessary that the membership remain static, see United States v.<br>                                                       ___ _____________<br><br>          Perholtz, 842 F.2d  343, 364 (D.C.

The<br><br>          district  court instructed  the  jury that  it  should convict  a<br><br>          particular defendant only  if it found him  or her to be  part of<br><br>          the  single  conspiracy  limned  in the  indictment.    The court<br><br>          cautioned the  jurors that  they must  acquit  any defendant  not<br><br>          linked  to  that  conspiracy even  if  they  concluded that  such<br><br>          defendant  had  been a  member  of  a  separate, equally  heinous<br><br>          conspiracy.  The  verdict, then, had the effect  of rejecting the<br><br><br>                                          54<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          "multiple  conspiracy"  defense,  instead signifying  the  jury's<br><br>          contrary conclusion that the appellants collogued together within<br><br>          the framework of the master conspiracy.<br><br>                    To  be sure,  the  charged  conspiracy  had  a  protean<br><br>          quality    but  many criminal  conspiracies,  particularly  large<br><br>          conspiracies that  function for  extended periods  of time,  must<br><br>          adjust  to  cope with  changing  conditions.    In this  respect,<br><br>          conspiracies are like other business organizations:  a conspiracy<br><br>          may  hire,  fire,  retool, change  suppliers,  expand,  downsize,<br><br>          refine   its  operating   practices,   undertake  new   marketing<br><br>          strategies, or  shift its priorities  from time  to time  without<br><br>          sacrificing its essential  identity.  It is, therefore, not fatal<br><br>          to  the  government's  "single  conspiracy"  theory  that   David<br><br>          Sepulveda began his career  by patronizing a cocaine supplier  in<br><br>          Nashua, and  later switched to  a source in Lawrence.   Likewise,<br><br>          the fact that the organization's methods and tactics evolved over<br><br>          time did not dictate  a finding of  two, three, or four  separate<br><br>          conspiracies.    The government  offered  evidence  showing that,<br><br>          throughout the  six-year period  covered by  the indictment,  the<br><br>          goals  of the organization were constant,  its leadership did not<br><br>          change, and  much of its  membership remained stable.   These are<br><br>          important indicia  of unitariness.   See David, 940 F.2d  at 734.<br>                                               ___ _____<br><br>          All in all,  we find the common threads adequate to create a jury<br><br>          question as to whether a single conspiracy existed.<br><br>                    The  evidence  tying  Edgar  Sepulveda  to  the  single<br><br>          conspiracy  is more  than ample.   Two  witnesses testified  that<br><br><br>                                          55<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Edgar, himself, sold them cocaine.  Four witnesses testified that<br><br>          Edgar routinely  accompanied his  brother, David,  on drug-buying<br><br>          sprees.   One of  these witnesses,  Norberto Perez, testified  to<br><br>          taking  an average  of one  such trip  a week with  the Sepulveda<br><br>          siblings over a protracted period of time.  Another witness, John<br><br>          Rice, testified that he  saw the Sepulvedas packaging  cocaine at<br><br>          Driesse's home.<br><br>                    There is  similar, albeit  less pervasive, evidence  of<br><br>          Rood's role  in the  organization.  Perez  testified that  he and<br><br>          Rood made  over fifteen trips  to Lawrence in order  to replenish<br><br>          David  Sepulveda's drug  inventory.   When  David  agreed to  pay<br><br>          Santos in  kind for chauffeuring  him during a drug  delivery, he<br><br>          instructed  Rood,  in  Santos's  presence,  to  give  Santos  his<br><br>          stipend.   On  another occasion,  David  sent Rood  and Perez  to<br><br>          retrieve cocaine that had  been abandoned during a  police chase.<br><br>          Finally,  a gaggle of witnesses, including Santos, testified that<br><br>          they had purchased cocaine from Rood.  From this variegated proof<br><br>          the jury could permissibly weave a tapestry linking Rood with the<br><br>          master conspiracy rather  than isolating him within  the cloister<br><br>          of the self-styled "mini-conspiracy" in which he now professes to<br><br>          have been involved.

While we comment separately on<br><br>          each  challenge, we  first lay  out  the black-letter  rule:   in<br><br>          general,  an  indictment   is  sufficiently   particular  if   it<br><br>          elucidates  the elements of the  crime, enlightens a defendant as<br><br>          to the  nature of the charge  against which she must  defend, and<br><br>          enables  her   to  plead  double   jeopardy  in  bar   of  future<br><br>          prosecutions for the same offense.

We<br><br>          think  her reading  of the  charging papers  is colored  by self-<br><br>          interest.<br><br>                    The grand jury indicted Welch for conspiracy to possess<br><br>          and distribute  cocaine in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     846.

The indictment also<br><br>          provides a temporal framework, asserts that Welch's residence was<br><br>          used as  a packaging center  for the drug distribution  ring, and<br><br>          states that she worked as a "runner" and a "street-level dealer."<br><br>          We think  this information  sufficiently spelled  out the  crime,<br><br>          apprised Welch of the charge against which she had to defend, and<br><br>          protected her from the boggart  of double jeopardy.

But the frequency<br><br>          with which a person is (or is  not) mentioned in an indictment is<br><br>          an  insufficient  indicium  of  the  indictment's  particularity.<br><br>          Here,  the  charging  papers  contained  considerable  contextual<br><br><br>                                          58<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          detail.   Given  the  indictment's  general  description  of  the<br><br>          conspiracy and  identification of the alleged  coconspirators, we<br><br>          find  that  it   put  Cullinane  on  fair  notice  and  contained<br><br>          information sufficient to allow him  to prepare his defense.

Her<br><br>          claim invokes  the  Speedy  Trial Act,  18  U.S.C.      3161-3174<br><br>          (1988).  The Act provides in pertinent part:<br><br>                         In  any  case  in which  a  plea  of not<br>                    guilty is entered,  the trial of a  defendant<br>                    charged in  an . .  . indictment . .  . shall<br>                    commence within seventy days from the  filing<br>                    date . . .  of the . . . indictment,  or from<br>                    the date the defendant has appeared before  a<br>                    judicial officer  . . ., whichever  date last<br>                    occurs.<br><br>          18 U.S.C.   3161(c)(1).<br><br>                    For   Speedy  Trial   Act  purposes,   time  has   both<br><br>          quantitative  and qualitative dimensions.  The Act's 70-day trial<br><br>          mandate,  see id.,  exemplifies its  quantitative side.   On  the<br>                    ___ ___<br><br>          qualitative  side,  the  Act  excludes  from  the  70-day  period<br><br>          intervals of delay  that result from such events  as the pendency<br><br>          of pretrial motions, see 18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F),  the presence<br>                               ___<br><br>          of other defendants  in the case "as  to whom the time  for trial<br><br>          has not run and no motion for severance has been granted," id. at<br>                                                                     ___<br><br>                                          60<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            3161(h)(7), or continuances which  serve the "ends of justice,"<br><br>          id. at   3161(h)(8)(A).  Therefore, a violation of the Act occurs<br>          ___<br><br>          only if (i) a sufficient  number of days elapse (the quantitative<br><br>          benchmark),  and (ii) the days are nonexcludable (the qualitative<br><br>          benchmark).<br><br>                    Against this background, the chronology of Welch's case<br><br>          is telling.  Her arraignment took place on November 19, 1990, and<br><br>          her trial started on April 2, 1991.  Quantitatively, this 134-day<br><br>          interval  exceeds the  goal set  by the Speedy  Trial Act.   But,<br><br>          qualitatively,  the  record  presents   a  much  more  excusatory<br><br>          picture.   The bulk of  the time elapsed between  arraignment and<br><br>          trial  is  excludable  for  Speedy  Trial  Act  purposes  because<br><br>          pretrial motions filed by the defendants, as  a group, engendered<br><br>          considerable delay (bringing the nonexcludable time to fewer than<br><br>          35 days).

We  do not<br><br>          find  it surprising  that  the  prosecution,  like  a  Pirandello<br><br>          character in  search of  an author,  has encountered  insuperable<br><br>          difficulties in articulating a viable theory:  the short of it is<br><br>          that the cash  was unlawfully  seized and  that evidence  derived<br><br>          from  the  seizure  should  have  been suppressed.    We  do  not<br><br>          understand why  the government is  unwilling simply to  face that<br><br>          fact    or why it pressed so vigorously to have evidence obtained<br><br>          in a patently illegal manner admitted in the first place.<br><br>                    At  any rate,  the matter  is academic.

When  a  potentially taint-<br><br>          producing  event threatens  to  mar  the  jury's  integrity,  the<br><br>          district  court has fairly  broad discretion in  deciding whether<br><br>          the  situation is  susceptible to  remediation, and  if  so, what<br><br>          corrective action might be appropriate.

The   drug  quantity<br><br>          attributable  to  a  particular defendant  is  derived  by adding<br><br>          together the amounts of narcotics, actual or negotiated, bound up<br><br>          in the acts  "that were  part of  the same course  of conduct  or<br><br>          common scheme  or plan as  the offense of conviction."

Perez did not  assign particular<br><br>          amounts to particular  people on  particular trips.   Rather,  he<br><br>          testified  in sweeping  generalities, stating  that the  smallest<br><br>          amount he  remembered having been  acquired, in the eighty  or so<br><br>          trips he took with Sepulveda and an assortment of companions over<br><br>          a two-year period (1987-1989), was four ounces (113.4 grams), and<br><br>          the largest amount acquired was one kilogram (an amount purchased<br><br>          more  than once).   In  preparing  the presentence  investigation<br><br>          report  (PSI Report), the probation department adopted methods of<br><br>          calculation  apparently  urged  by the  prosecution.    The basic<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               29To  be sure, there  was some evidence  of participation by<br>          Rood and-or Wallace in a few other incidents.  But the quantities<br>          involved in  these incidents were  niggling in comparison  to the<br>          Sepulveda trips and, thus, do not affect these appeals.<br><br>                                          71<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          method  was to  construct a  double "average"  covering both  the<br><br>          number of runs  and the amount of cocaine carried.  This was done<br><br>          by  taking  the  midpoint  of   the  high  and  low  figures  and<br><br>          multiplying the  average  number of  runs by  the average  amount<br><br>          carried.  Thus, in Wallace's  case, the PSI Report assumed twelve<br><br>          runs (an alleged "average" of ten and fifteen) and 556 grams  per<br><br>          run  (the rounded-off average, expressed in grams, of four ounces<br><br>          and  one kilogram),  attributing  a total  of  6.68 kilograms  of<br><br>          cocaine to  him.  In  Rood's case, a different  probation officer<br><br>          proposed  a  slightly   more  complicated  (but  methodologically<br><br>          similar) calculation  and attributed 8.3  kilograms to him.   The<br><br>          exact  mechanics  are beside  the  point; what  matters,  for our<br><br>          purposes,  is  that,  albeit  somewhat  more  circuitously,   the<br><br>          ultimate attribution  of a  drug quantity figure  to Rood,  as to<br><br>          Wallace,  represented   an  assumed   average  number  of   trips<br><br>          multiplied by an assumed average quantity of cocaine per trip.<br><br>                    The district  court held  separate sentencing  hearings<br><br>          for Rood and Wallace.  Neither the prosecution nor the defendants<br><br>          offered additional evidence.  The court, over objection, endorsed<br><br>          the probation  officers' calculations, attributing  8.3 kilograms<br><br>          of cocaine to Rood and 7.6 kilograms  to Wallace.  This yielded a<br><br>          base  offense level  (BOL)  of 32  for  each man.   See  U.S.S.G.<br>                                                              ___<br><br>           2D1.1(c) (6) (Drug Quantity  Table) (establishing BOL of 32  for<br><br>          at least five  but less than fifteen kilograms of  cocaine).  The<br><br>          court  essayed  further  offense-level  adjustments (not  now  in<br><br>          dispute), factored Rood's criminal history category (IV) into the<br><br><br>                                          72<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          mix,  and set  his guideline  sentencing range  (GSR) at  135-168<br><br>          months.   The court sentenced  Rood at  the bottom of  the range.<br><br>          Wallace  displayed a  less notorious  criminal history  (category<br><br>          II).  Nonetheless,  after interim adjustments not  material here,<br><br>          his GSR proved  to be  identical.

But,  the<br><br>          trial judge  heard and saw  Perez testify at trial,  and credited<br><br>          his testimony.

To say that the<br><br>          minimum amount carried on a single  trip was four ounces and that<br><br>          the maximum  was  one kilogram  provides  no rational  basis  for<br><br>          presuming that  the average amount  carried on a given  number of<br><br>          trips  was  the mathematical  midpoint between  the high  and low<br><br>          figures.   Cf. United States v.

Similarly,  while the<br><br>          distortions are mathematically  less serious, the selection  of a<br><br>          midpoint in  estimating  the  number of  trips  is  also  without<br><br>          evidentiary support.   And the  two flawed findings feed  on each<br><br>          other; by using not one,  but two, unsupported averages to arrive<br><br>          at both the number of trips undertaken and the amounts of cocaine<br><br>          handled  in the  course of  each trip,  the court  compounded the<br><br>          error of its ways.   This is,  after all, not a  case in which  a<br><br>          witness testified that, in his or her estimation,"X" equalled the<br><br>          average  drug quantity  involved  in a  specific  number of  drug<br><br>          transactions.   That  kind of  estimate  from a  lay witness  may<br><br>          itself be  troublesome, but  at least the  witness can  be cross-<br><br>          examined  on the figure;  and this  court has  sometimes accepted<br><br>          such  estimates  in  the  past.   See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.<br>                                            ___   ____   ______________<br><br>          Innamorati, 996  F.2d 456, 490  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  ___ S.<br>          __________                                  _____ ______<br><br>          Ct. ___ (1993).  It is also  not a case where a witness has given<br><br>          a  range, as  to amounts  or  as to  trips, but  other persuasive<br><br>          evidence (e.g., documents or records) exists tending to show that<br>                    ____<br><br>          some figure within  the range is supported by  a preponderance of<br><br>          the evidence.  Here, to the contrary, the court did not cite, and<br><br>          the PSI Report did not  identify, any extrinsic evidence or other<br><br>          circumstances   making   averaging  peculiarly   appropriate   or<br><br>          suggesting a  basis, apart from averaging, on which the probation<br><br>          officers'  determinations  might rest.

For example, it  may well<br>          be that better evidence  can be adduced by recalling  Perez or by<br>          calling other witnesses.   Alternatively, the government  has the<br>          "low point" estimates as to both  the number of trips and amounts<br>          transported to fall back upon   and it has some specific evidence<br>          as to other transactions.  To start a mini-trial on drug quantity<br>          is surely a  discouraging supplement to a lengthy  trial; but too<br>          much rides  on the  computations to  rely upon the  kind of  drug<br>          quantity calculations  that the  government urges  in respect  to<br>          these two appellants.<br><br>               32We  do not  dissect the  interim  adjustments made  by the<br>          district court en route to  the GSR as Cullinane concentrates his<br>          fire on the  drug quantity finding.

It   is<br><br>          unnecessary  to   address  an   allegedly  erroneous   sentencing<br><br>          computation if,  and to the  extent that, correcting it  will not<br><br>          change  the applicable offense  level or otherwise  influence the<br><br>          defendant's  GSR (and,  ultimately, his  sentence).

This<br><br>          principle is pertinent in Cullinane's  case:  his BOL, and, thus,<br><br>          his sentence, will remain unchanged  so long as he is responsible<br><br>          for an amount of cocaine between five and fifteen kilograms.

Even if<br><br>          Chase's  testimony is reliable,  he ruminates, the  conduct Chase<br><br>          describes is irrelevant to the charged conspiracy.

See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Table).<br><br>                                 F.  Cheryl Johnson.<br>                                 F.  Cheryl Johnson.<br>                                     ______________<br><br>                    The  lower court attributed 1.2 kilograms of cocaine to<br><br>          Cheryl  Johnson  and  imposed  the  mandatory  minimum  five-year<br><br>          sentence.   See 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  Johnson  disputes the<br>                      ___<br><br>          drug quantity  finding.  Here,  again, the trigger amount  is 500<br><br>          grams of cocaine.  See id.<br>                             ___ ___<br><br>                    The district court determined, inter alia, that Johnson<br>                                                   _____ ____<br><br>          sold 1/16th  of an  ounce of cocaine  to Santos  on at  least 100<br><br>          occasions; and that she sold 3/10s of an ounce to  officer Malone<br><br>          on another occasion.  The  court further found that $7,115 seized<br><br>          from  Johnson's house constituted the proceeds of drug sales and,<br><br>          for sentencing purposes, equated this cash stash with 5.08 ounces<br><br>          of cocaine.   Finally, the court credited  Perez's testimony that<br><br>          Johnson  participated in  at  least  "a  couple"  of  drug-buying<br><br>          expeditions.   Erring  on the  side of  caution, the  court could<br><br>          warrantably   have  found  Johnson  responsible  for  two  trips,<br><br><br><br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               33At the  risk of carrying  coal to Newcastle, we  note that<br>          Edward Welch  was a  fellow traveller on,  and a  co-venturer in,<br>          several  drug-buying  expeditions  described  supra  Part  XI(D).<br>                                                        _____<br>          Thus, the drug  quantities associated with those  jaunts are also<br>          attributable to him.<br><br>                                          81<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          involving  four  ounces  per  trip.34    In  the  aggregate,  the<br><br>          determinations  listed above support the attribution of 556 grams<br><br>          of  cocaine  to Johnson     more  than  the minimum  required  to<br><br>          underbrace the sentence she received.<br><br>                    Johnson  argues against these  serial findings on three<br><br>          grounds.  Her first attack   a broadside blast aimed at the total<br><br>          quantity  of cocaine attributed to her   deserves little comment.<br><br>          We simply restate the obvious:   the district court's credibility<br><br>          calls  are  beyond  reproach   and,  therefore,  its  bottom-line<br><br>          conclusion is not clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    Johnson's  second  fusillade  is  aimed   at  the  cash<br><br>          equivalency finding.  In drawing a head on the sentencing court's<br><br>          decision to  translate dollars  into drugs,  Johnson is  shooting<br><br>          blanks.   The government presented abundant evidence of Johnson's<br><br>          narcotics trafficking, see  supra Part II(D),  and the volume  of<br>                                 ___  _____<br><br>          business  transacted justified the court's illation that the sums<br><br>          seized  were  connected  to  her  drug  dealings.    When  it  is<br><br>          reasonably probable that confiscated cash  represents either drug<br><br>          profits   or  money  dedicated   to  the  upcoming   purchase  of<br><br>          contraband,   a  sentencing  court  may  convert  the  cash  into<br><br>          equivalent  amounts of narcotics for "relevant conduct" purposes.<br><br>          See U.S.S.G.   2D1.4, comment. (n.2) (authorizing district courts<br>          ___<br><br>          to use price as a means of approximating drug quantity); see also<br>                                                                   ___ ____<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               34The court actually found that Johnson's two trips involved<br>          16 ounces per trip.   But, this finding utilized an impermissible<br>          process of rote averaging.  See supra  Part XI(B).  Hence, we use<br>                                      ___ _____<br>          the low end of the range  of available estimates for purposes  of<br>          appellate review.<br><br>                                          82<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          United States v.

Ct.  1346 (1993); United  States v.  Gerante, 891<br>          ______                            ______________     _______<br><br>          F.2d 364, 369 (1st Cir. 1989).  So it is here.<br><br>                    Johnson's  third salvo also  flies wide of  the target.<br><br>          She insists that the cash did not belong to her and, thus, cannot<br><br>          figure  in  her  sentence.   But  as  we  read  the  record,  the<br><br>          circumstantial  evidence   supports  a  finding   of  proprietary<br><br>          interest.   And, moreover, even  if we were  to give credence  to<br><br>          Johnson's  protest  regarding  ownership,  the  cash  equivalency<br><br>          evidence could  be used against  her as  long as  the drug  money<br><br>          constituted part  of the same common  scheme or plan  and met the<br><br>          foreseeability  requirement   for  relevant  conduct   under  the<br><br>          guidelines.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15; Blanco, 888 F.2d at 910-<br>                       ___ ______                  ______<br><br>          11; see also  supra Part  XI(A) (discussing  relevant conduct  in<br>              ___ ____  _____<br><br>          conspiracy  cases).    The  evidence  here  could  reasonably  be<br><br>          interpreted as  placing the  cash stash within  the orbit  of the<br><br>          conspiracy.   For these reasons, we detect  no clear error in the<br><br>          lower  court's conclusion  that the  money ought  properly to  be<br><br>          treated  as  a  proxy  for  cocaine  and  counted   against  this<br><br>          appellant.<br><br>                    Johnson  has two  final  items  in  her  asseverational<br><br>          array.  She asserts that the court should have reduced her BOL by<br><br>          two levels since  she was merely a minor participant  in the drug<br><br>          distribution scheme, see  U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b), and that  the court<br>                               ___<br><br>          should  have departed downward  due to her  family circumstances.<br><br><br>                                          83<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Neither assertion has much firepower.<br><br>                    As  to   the  former   plaint,  a   role-in-the-offense<br><br>          reduction,  even if granted, would  have no effect on appellant's<br><br>          sentence  due to the  overriding force  of the  mandatory minimum<br><br>          prescribed by 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  See U.S.S.G.   5G1.1(b)<br>                                                    ___<br><br>          (providing that  the statutorily required  minimum sentence shall<br><br>          be  the  guideline  sentence  when  it exceeds  the  top  of  the<br><br>          applicable GSR).  The assignment of error is, therefore, moot.<br><br>                    As  to  Johnson's last  point,  it is  settled  in this<br><br>          circuit  that a  sentencing  judge's  informed  decision  not  to<br><br>          depart, regardless of direction, is a non-appealable event.   See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          United States  v.
