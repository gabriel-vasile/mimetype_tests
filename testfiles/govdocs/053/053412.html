  At various times in American history, emergencies have arisen--posing, 
in varying degrees of severity, the loss of life, property, or public 
order--and threatened the well-being of the Nation. The Constitution 
created a government of limited powers, and emergency powers, as such, 
failed to attract much attention during the Philadelphia Convention of 
1787 which created the charter for the new government. It may be argued, 
however, that the granting of emergency powers to Congress is implicit 
in its Article I, section 8 authority to ``provide for the common 
Defence and general Welfare''; the commerce clause; its war, Armed 
Forces, and militia powers; and the ``necessary and proper'' clause 
empowering it to make such laws as are required to fulfill the 
executions of ``the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by 
this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any 
Department or Officer thereof.'' The President was authorized to call 
special sessions of Congress, perhaps doing so in order that 
arrangements for responding to an emergency might be legislated for 
executive implementation.
  A national emergency may be said to be gravely threatening to the 
country, and recognizable in its most extreme form as auguring the 
demise of the nation. The more extreme the threat, likely more 
widespread will be the consensus that a national emergency exists. At 
times, however, the term has been artfully used as political rhetoric to 
rally public support, or employed nebulously. According to a dictionary 
definition, an emergency is ``an unforeseen combination of circumstances 
or the resulting state that calls for immediate action.'' \1\ In the 
midst of the Great Depression, a 1934 majority opinion of the Supreme 
Court characterized an emergency in terms of urgency and relative 
infrequency of occurrence, as well as equivalence to a public calamity 
resulting from fire, flood, or like disaster not reasonably subject to 
anticipation.\2\ Constitutional law scholar Edward S. Corwin once 
explained emergency conditions as being those ``which have not attained 
enough of stability or recurrency to admit of their being dealt with 
according to rule.'' \3\ During Senate committee hearings on national 
emergency powers in 1973, a political scientist described an emergency, 
saying: ``It denotes the existence of conditions of varying nature, 
intensity and duration, which are perceived to threaten life or well-
being beyond tolerable limits.'' \4\ The term, he explained, ``connotes 
the existence of conditions suddenly intensifying the degree of existing 
danger to life or well-being beyond that which is accepted as normal.''

  In responding to an emergency situation, Presidents have exercised 
such powers as were available by explicit grant or interpretive 
implication--so-called implied powers--or otherwise acted of necessity, 
trusting to a subsequent acceptance of their actions by Congress, the 
courts, and the citizenry. They have, as well, sought statutory bestowal 
of new powers. In such circumstances, the Speakers of the House of 
Representatives have played varied roles. Presidents also have 
occasionally taken an emergency action which they assumed to be 
constitutionally permissible. Thus, in the American governmental 
experience, the exercise of emergency powers has been somewhat dependent 
upon the Chief Executive's view of the office. The authority of a 
President in this regard, however, is not determined by the incumbent 
alone. Other institutions and their leaders, such as the Speaker of the 
House, may have a tempering effect on, or constitute either an obstacle 
to, or a sustainer of, the President's actions in response to an 
emergency.
  In the account that follows, four of the most challenging national 
emergencies in the American governmental experience--the Civil War, 
World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II--are reviewed with a 
view to the role of the Speaker during these crises. That role has been 
a varied one due to several factors, not the least of which are 
personality, political partisanship, ideology, institutional stature, 
and statesmanship.

                              The Civil War

  For several decades after the inauguration of the Federal Government 
under the Constitution, controversy and conflict over slavery had 
steadily grown in the Nation until it erupted in regional rebellion and 
insurrection in late 1860. News of the election of President Abraham 
Lincoln, who was known to be hostile to slavery, prompted a public 
convention in South Carolina. Convening a few days before Christmas, the 
assembled voted unanimously to dissolve the union between South Carolina 
and the other States. During the next 2 months, seven States of the 
Lower South followed South Carolina in secession. Simultaneously, State 
troops began seizing Federal arsenals and forts located within the 
secessionist territory. In his fourth and final annual message to 
Congress on December 3, 1860, President James Buchanan conceded that, 
due to the resignation of Federal judicial officials throughout South 
Carolina, ``the whole machinery of the Federal Government necessary for 
the distribution of remedial justice among the people has been 
demolished.'' He contended, however, that ``the Executive has no 
authority to decide what shall be the relations between the Federal 
Government and South Carolina.'' Any attempt in this regard, he felt, 
would ``be a naked act of usurpation.'' Consequently, Buchanan indicated 
that it was his ``duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all 
its bearings,'' observing that ``the emergency may soon arise when you 
may be called upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess 
the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union.'' 
Having ``arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated 
to Congress or to any other department of the Federal Government,'' he 
proposed that Congress should call a constitutional convention, or ask 
the States to call one, for purposes of adopting a constitutional 
amendment recognizing the right of property in slaves in the States 
where slavery existed or might thereafter occur.\6\

  By the time of Lincoln's inauguration (March 4, 1861), the Confederate 
provisional government had been established (February 4); Jefferson 
Davis had been elected (February 9) and installed as the President of 
the Confederacy (February 18); an army had been assembled by the 
secessionist States; Federal troops, who had been withdrawn to Fort 
Sumter in Charleston Harbor, were becoming desperate for relief and 
resupply; and the 36th Congress had adjourned (March 3). A dividing 
nation was poised to witness ``the high-water mark of the exercise of 
executive power in the United States.'' Indeed, in retrospect, it has 
been observed: ``No one can ever know just what Lincoln conceived to be 
limits of his powers.'' \7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A month after his inauguration, the new President notified South 
Carolina authorities that an expedition was en route solely to provision 
the Fort Sumter troops. The receipt of this message prompted a demand 
that the garrison's commander immediately surrender. The commander 
demurred, and, on April 12, the fort and its inhabitants, over the next 
34 hours, were subjected to continuous, intense fire from shore 
batteries until they finally surrendered. The attack galvanized the 
North for a defense of the Union. Lincoln, however, did not immediately 
call Congress into special session. Instead, for reasons not altogether 
clear, he not only delayed convening Congress, but also, with broad 
support in the North, engaged in a series of actions which intruded upon 
the constitutional authority of the legislature. These included ordering 
75,000 of ``the militia of the several States of the Union'' into 
Federal service ``to cause the laws to be duly executed,'' and calling 
Congress into special session on July 4 ``to consider and determine, 
such measures, as, in their wisdom, the public safety, and interest may 
seem to demand;'' blockading the ports of the secessionist States; 
adding 19 vessels to the Navy ``for purposes of public defense;'' 
extending the initial blockade to the ports of Virginia and North 
Carolina; and enlarging the Armed Forces with 22,714 men for the regular 
Army, 18,000 personnel for the Navy, and 42,032 volunteers for 3-year 
terms of service.\8\

Presidents, vol. 7, pp. 3214-3217.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In his July 4 special session message to Congress, Lincoln indicated 
that his actions expanding the Armed Forces, ``whether strictly legal or 
not, were ventured upon under what appeared to be a popular and a public 
necessity, trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify 
them. It is believed,'' he continued, ``that nothing has been done 
beyond the constitutional competency of Congress.'' \9\ Indeed, in an 
act of August 6, 1861, Lincoln's ``acts, proclamations, and orders'' 
concerning the Army, Navy, militia, and volunteers from the States were 
``approved and in all respects legalized and made valid, to the same 
intent and with the same effect as if they had been issued and done 
under the previous express authority and direction of the Congress.'' 
\10\ During the next 4 years of civil war, Congress would continue to be 
largely supportive of Lincoln's prosecution of the insurrection.

  The House Environment.--The 37th Congress, which Lincoln convened in 
July, initially met for about a month. Members returned in December for 
a second session, which consumed about 200 days of the next year, and a 
third session, beginning in December 1862 and ending in early March 
1863. The President had party majorities in both Chambers: about two-
thirds of the Senate was Republican and the House counted 106 
Republicans, 42 Democrats, and 28 Unionists. The 1862 elections shifted 
the House balance to 102 Republicans and 75 Democrats. Despite the 
numerical dominance of the Republicans, however, ``no one individual or 
faction was able to establish firm control of the congressional agendas 
during the Civil War.'' \11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Investigation and oversight activities by congressional committees 
increased during the Civil War, ``when 15 of 35 select committees were 
primarily concerned with wrongdoing or improper performance of duties,'' 
and similar probes were being conducted by at least six standing 
committees. The war affected these inquiries because it added urgency to 
proper administrative performance and prompted enlarged Federal 
expenditures. There were, as well, committee examinations of matters 
more closely connected with the war.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\12\ Ibid., pp. 60-88.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Perhaps the best known of the wartime oversight panels was the Joint 
Committee on the Conduct of the War. While some of its tactics--secret 
testimony, leaks to the press, disallowance of an opportunity to 
confront or cross examine accusers--and its bias against West Point 
officers remain unacceptable, its probes of the Fort Pillow massacre, in 
which Union black troops were murdered and not allowed to surrender, and 
the poor condition of Union soldiers returned from Confederate prisons 
``were among its more positive achievements.'' Indeed, ``a number of its 
investigations exposed corruption, financial mismanagement, and crimes 
against humanity,'' with the result that the panel ``deserves praise not 
only for exposing these abuses but also for using such disclosures to 
invigorate northern public opinion and bolster the resolve to continue 
the war. Had the committee's work always been modeled on these 
investigations,'' it has been rightly concluded, ``there would be little 
debate about its positive, albeit minor, contribution to the Union war 
effort.'' \13\

  By one estimate, the ``most influential member of the House of 
Representatives during this period was Thaddeus Stevens of 
Pennsylvania,'' whose ``influence over the House exceeded that of its 
speakers.'' \14\ An attorney and former member of the Pennsylvania 
legislature, he had initially been elected to the House of 
Representatives as a Whig in 1848. He was subsequently elected to the 
House as a Republican in 1858, and soon became the leader of the 
radicals who strongly opposed slavery. He chaired the Ways and Means 
Committee during the 37th and 38th Congresses, and died in office in the 
summer of 1868.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Speaker Galusha A. Grow.--Born and reared in Pennsylvania, Grow had 
been a practicing attorney before he was first elected to the House of 
Representatives as a Democrat in 1850. He was returned to the 33d and 
34th Congresses as a Democrat, but slavery and related issues prompted 
him to change party affiliation and he was elected to the 35th, 36th, 
and 37th Congresses as a Republican. A redrawn district contributed to 
his electoral defeat in 1862, and he would not return to the House until 
1883 when he was elected to fill a seat left vacant by the death of the 
incumbent. Grow's oratorical and leadership qualities contributed to his 
initially being nominated by former Speaker Nathaniel Banks for the 
speakership in 1857. Although Grow had the support of nearly all 
Republicans, he lost to Democrat James L. Orr of South Carolina.\15\ He 
was nominated again for the speakership in 1860, but the more moderate 
William Pennington of New Jersey was the choice.\16\ A long-time 
champion of the Homestead Act, Grow was among the leaders who, having 
brought the legislation to final passage, saw their efforts defeated by 
President Buchanan's veto. The bill enacted by the 37th Congress, 
however, was successfully carried into law in May 1862, a few months 
before Grow would be defeated for reelection.\17\

  With the convening of the 37th Congress, Grow had the support of 
Thaddeus Stevens, who nominated him for the speakership. Less radical 
contenders were Schuyler Colfax of Indiana and Frank Blair of Missouri. 
The situation was urgent, and ``the Republicans had agreed not to 
tolerate any protracted conflict over the speakership.'' On the first 
ballot, Grow had 71 votes, 9 short of victory. ``Blair, in second place 
with forty, withdrew and urged his supporters to switch their votes; 
twenty-eight did,'' and ``Grow won with ninety-nine votes.'' \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\18\ Ibid., pp. 202-203.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stevens was instrumental in Grow's capture of the speakership. The two 
men had become acquainted some time ago in their native Pennsylvania. 
They had come to hold similarly strong views opposing slavery and 
supporting the preservation of the Union, and both were resistant to the 
efforts of Simon Cameron and Andrew Curtin to control the State 
Republican Party. Stevens had nominated Grow for the speakership in 
1860, and Grow had recommended Stevens to President-elect Lincoln for a 
Cabinet position.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\19\ Ibid., pp. 194-195.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ``When it came time to make committee assignments, Grow did what was 
expected of him--he appointed radicals and friends.'' He also annoyed 
some Cabinet secretaries for not consulting with them on appointments 
that affected their departments.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\20\ Ibid., p. 203.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Described as ``firm, calm, and precise in construing the rules'' of 
the House, Grow deferred to Stevens in the party caucus and ``Stevens 
was the domineering personality on the floor,'' but he would 
occasionally challenge his friend regarding procedure.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\21\ Ibid., pp. 204-205.

  One good example occurred on July 18, 1861, when Henry May of Maryland 
asked for the floor to defend himself against charges that he had had 
``criminal intercourse'' with the rebels in Richmond. John Hutchins of 
Ohio objected to the way in which May attacked the military authorities 
in Baltimore. Stevens said May was out of order, but Grow ruled that May 
was entitled to the floor. Stevens put his protest into the form of a 
motion, which the chair refused to entertain. When Stevens appealed the 
decision, Grow insisted he had no control over the train of remarks May 
might pursue and, therefore, could not rule him out of order. The chair 
was overruled, but May was permitted to continue.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\22\ Ibid., p. 205.

  Perhaps surprising to some, Grow, the radical, got along ``admirably'' 
with the President, and reportedly ``believed Lincoln to be almost 
infallible, a leader who never rubbed Congress the wrong way and who 
handled men masterfully.'' \23\ Grow, Stevens, and a caucus of a dozen 
other radicals, accepted Lincoln's moderate approach to emancipation, 
supporting the President's proposal for Federal assistance to any State 
that adopted a plan of gradual emancipation, as well as legislation for 
immediate emancipation in the District of Columbia.\24\

\24\ Ibid., p. 207.

  It was Grow's fortune to be Speaker during one of the nation's 
critical moments. The Thirty-seventh Congress faced an awesome task. It 
had to raise, organize, and equip military forces, and to find the means 
to support them and the government as well. Yet its performance record 
was impressive. Before it adjourned in early August, the special session 
had passed more than sixty bills, and productivity was to continue into 
the second and third sessions. Fortunately, the Republicans enjoyed a 
comfortable majority and were able when necessary to ride roughshod over 
the Democratic opposition. A call for the question often ended the 
Democrat's efforts at prolonged debate.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\25\ Ibid., p. 204.

  Speaker Schuyler Colfax.--Grow's electoral defeat in 1862 assured that 
the 38th Congress would have a new Speaker of the House.\26\ The choice 
was Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, a newspaperman who had unsuccessfully 
sought election to the 32d Congress as a Whig. Two years later, running 
as a Republican, he was sent to the House and remained there for the 
next 5 Congresses (1855-1864). He and Grow ``became friends and close 
allies in their struggle for a free Kansas and a homestead bill.'' \27\ 
However, his relationship with Stevens, according to one assessment, was 
somewhat different than that of his predecessor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\26\ Concerning Colfax's preparations and support in this regard, see

Idol (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Bureau, 1952), pp. 182-184, 196.

\27\ Illisevich, Galusha A. Grow: The People's Candidate, p. 112.

  Colfax possessed neither will nor mind of his own. Thaddeus Stevens 
furnished him with these mental attributes. The fact that Stevens 
permitted him to remain as speaker for six years furnishes the best 
index of his character. He was the alter ego.\28\

  By contrast, an 1868 campaign pamphlet by an anonymous author offered 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the following description of Colfax's speakership.

  Every session of Congress has been marked by great bitterness of 
feeling, and yet so just has been his ruling, so courteous and kind his 
manner to foes as well as friends, that he has been popular with both 
parties. Probably not one man in a thousand could have passed through 
the trying scenes which he has, with the same equanimity and approbation 
of both friends and foes.\29\

the United States House of Representatives and Republican Candidates for 
the Vice-Presidency (New York: E.B. Treat, 1868), p. 12; the author is 
identified on the title page as ``a distinguished historian.''

  Indeed, Colfax was well regarded as a presiding officer, and his 
party, still under the iron rule of Stevens in the caucus, enjoyed 
dominant majorities during his tenure as Speaker.\30\ As a 
Representative, however, he appears to have left no individual mark upon 
the statute books. Moreover, ``Colfax's influence on the development or 
passage of specific legislation is unclear.'' \31\ In a biography 
published shortly after the former Speaker's death, Ovando J. Hollister 
summed up his late brother-in-law's role in the House.

  The two successive re-elections of Speaker Colfax attest the great 
satisfaction he gave in this high office. These were as eventful times 
as ever chanced in the annals of men, and the actors played their part 
in a manly way, worthy of their place in the line of generations that 
has won from the oppressor, maintained, and transmitted liberty. Neither 
before nor since have there been greater Houses than those which called 
Schuyler Colfax to be their presiding officer; at no time in our history 
were the people and their Congresses in closer sympathy, and this was 
due in part to the Speaker's faculty of wise and successful political 
management.\32\

  That political management included consultations with Cabinet members 
concerning their preferences for Representatives assigned to the House 
committees with which they had to deal. It also involved scheming and 
connivance that, according to an entry in the diary of Secretary of the 
Navy Gideon Wells, resulted in Lincoln considering him to be ``a little 
intriguer,--plausible, aspiring beyond his capacity, and not 
trustworthy.'' The diary of John Hay, Lincoln's secretary, reflected 
similar White House doubts about Colfax.\33\ Lincoln had preferred 
others for the speakership, but when it fell to Colfax, the President 
met with him, only to receive ``what was not exactly a pledge of support 
but a promise of neutrality in the upcoming fights in Congress between 
Radicals and Conservatives.'' \34\ It was, seemingly, less than he had 
enjoyed with Grow.

\33\ Bogue, The Congressman's Civil War, pp. 116-117; another historian 
has written that the exact relationship between Colfax and Lincoln ``is 
difficult to ascertain,'' but expressed doubt that it was ``the intimate 
relationship'' portrayed by Hollister; see Smith, Schuyler Colfax, pp. 
168-169.

                               World War I

  When war swept over Europe during the latter months of 1914, the 
United States, in terms of emergency conditions confronting the Nation, 
was unaffected by the conflict. Initially pursuing a policy of 
neutrality, President Woodrow Wilson, in September 1915, reluctantly 
agreed to allow American bankers to make general loans to the 
belligerent nations. These loans, foreign bond purchases, and foreign 
trade tended to favor Great Britain and France. Earlier, in February 
1915, Germany had proclaimed the waters around the British Isles a war 
zone which neutral ships might enter at their own risk. In May, the 
British transatlantic steamer Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine 
with the loss of 1,198 lives, including 128 Americans. Disclosures of 
German espionage and sabotage in the United States later in the year, 
unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany as of February 1917, and March 
revelations of German intrigue to form an alliance with Mexico 
contributed to the President calling a special session of Congress on 
April 2, when he asked for a declaration of war, which was given final 
approval 4 days later.\35\

  As Wilson led the Nation into war, the ``preponderance of his crisis 
authority,'' it has been noted, ``was delegated to him by statutes of 
Congress.'' Indeed, ``Wilson chose to demand express legislative 
authority for almost every unusual step he felt impelled to take.'' By 
comparison, the source of Lincoln's power ``was the Constitution, and he 
operated in spite of Congress,'' while the ``basis of Wilson's power was 
a group of statutes, and he cooperated with Congress.\36\

  The President also exercised certain discretion over and above that 
provided by statute. For example, he armed American merchantmen in 
February 1917; created a propaganda and censorship entity in April 
1917--the Committee on Public Information--which had no statutory 
authority for its limitations on the First Amendment; and he created 
various emergency agencies under the broad authority of the Council of 
National Defense, which had been statutorily mandated in 1916.\37\

  ``Among the important statutory delegations to the President,'' it has 
been recounted, ``were acts empowering him to take over and operate the 
railroads and water systems, to regulate and commandeer all ship-
building facilities in the United States, to regulate and prohibit 
exports'' and ``to raise an army by conscription.'' Others authorized 
him ``to allocate priorities in transportation, to regulate the conduct 
of resident enemy aliens, to take over and operate the telegraph and 
telephone systems, to redistribute functions among the executive 
agencies of the federal government, to control the foreign language 
press, and to censor all communications to and from foreign countries.''

  In November 1918, Republican majorities were elected to both Houses of 
Congress, and an armistice was signed in Europe, bringing a cessation of 
warfare. As peace negotiations, with Wilson participating, began in 
Paris in mid-January, many temporary wartime authorities began to 
expire; most of the remaining war statutes and agencies were terminated 
by an act of March 3, 1921.\39\

  The House Environment.--The Presidential contest of 1912 had resulted 
in the election of Woodrow Wilson, the first Democrat to occupy the 
White House since 1897. His party held a substantial margin of seats 
(291 to 127) in the House at the start of his administration, which 
quickly dwindled during the next two Congresses and disappeared in 1918; 
an initial seven-seat margin in the Senate grew slightly during the next 
two Congresses before the opposition gained a two-seat majority in 1918.
  The 63d Congress convened about a month after Wilson's March 4, 1913, 
inauguration. On April 8, a day after their assembly, the two Houses in 
joint session were personally addressed by Wilson--``the first President 
to do so since Jefferson stopped the practice in 1801. He wanted the 
members of Congress to see that he was a real person,'' one commentator 
has observed, ``and a partner in their work, he told them, not `a mere 
department of the Government hailing Congress from some isolated island 
of jealous power'.'' \40\ It was the beginning of a new relationship 
between the first and second branches.

  During the new President's first years in office, relations between 
the White House and Congress underwent a drastic change. [Theodore] 
Roosevelt had fought Congress and had often gone over its head to the 
people to get it to act, but he was never able to establish the primacy 
of his office over the conservative leadership in the legislature. 
[William Howard] Taft had shied away from even contesting for dominance. 
But it was now a different Congress. . . . [Wilson's] Democratic 
majorities were well organized and led by, and to a large extent 
composed of, men who shared the chief executive's goals, were as eager 
as he to compile a record of party achievement, and were willing to 
follow or cooperate with him. It was a situation made to order for a man 
of Wilson's commitment and temperament. . . . Believing strongly in 
party government and in his responsibility to be the nation's political 
head, Wilson gave forceful leadership to his party in Congress from his 
first day in office, telling it what he wanted it to do, introducing and 
sponsoring legislation, working closely with the Democratic leaders, 
committee heads, and individual members to achieve his programs, and in 
the process strengthening and broadening the powers and prestige of the 
presidency.\41\

  The outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914 found the President and 
Congress initially in agreement on a policy of strict neutrality. German 
submarine warfare soon created a division of opinion between the 
neutralists and peace forces, on the one hand, and those demanding the 
defense of American's rights on the high seas, on the other. This 
division led to conflicts in 1915 and 1916 between the White House and 
congressional Democrats. In the first instance, Wilson's refusal to 
issue a warning to Americans against traveling on armed merchantmen not 
only prompted protests from Democrats in both houses, but also 
resolutions mandating such a warning and an entree for congressional 
formulation of foreign policy. Vigorous efforts by the President, key 
Republicans in Congress, and the press, got the resolutions tabled. The 
second controversy arose over Presidentially proposed military 
preparedness legislation, which included a new national volunteer 
``Continental Army'' program. The measure was held captive in committee 
by a peace bloc led by the House Majority Leader, Claude Kitchen. Wilson 
had to compromise: the resulting legislation provided for an immediate 
expansion of the regular Army, enlargement of the National Guard, and 
integration of the Guard into Army organization and command.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\42\ Ibid., pp. 297-298.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Although Wilson emphasized a neutrality theme in his 1916 campaign for 
reelection, he was almost defeated, edging by his opponent with a 
plurality of 23 electoral votes, and saw his party strength in the House 
reduced to a majority of only a few seats. At the end of January 1917, 
Germany stunned Wilson with the announcement that it was resuming 
unrestricted submarine warfare. Shortly thereafter, an American ship was 
torpedoed and sunk without warning, prompting the President to break 
diplomatic relations with Germany. Near the end of February, Wilson 
asked Congress for authority to arm merchant ships and to use other 
``instrumentalities or methods'' to protect American shipping. The 
House, on March 1, overwhelmingly gave approval to the first part of the 
President's request; adamant noninterventionists in the Senate launched 
a filibuster against the authorization. Subsequently, Wilson went ahead 
with the ship armament on his own authority and called for a special 
session of Congress on April 16, then changed the convening to April 2. 
That evening he asked the 65th Congress for a declaration of war against 
Germany. This was accomplished 4 days later.\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\43\ Ibid., pp. 299-301.

  There followed the passage of a stream of war legislation, beginning 
with the appropriations of $4 billion for the army and navy and 
authorization for a Liberty Loan of bonds to be sold to the public (four 
Liberty Loan drives during the war and a Victory Loan in 1919 raised a 
total of $20.5 billion). A Selective Service Bill providing for 
universal conscription caused bitter controversy in the House, where 
Speaker [Champ] Clark left his chair to oppose the measure. Its 
constitutionality--sending drafted men outside the United States--seemed 
open to question, but it was enacted on May 18, 1917.\44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\44\ Ibid., p. 301.

  The stream of war legislation continued, including ``several acts, 
urged by the administration and supported by the fervent patriotism and 
anti-German feeling of a great majority of the American people and their 
representatives in Congress, [which] broke sharply with the relatively 
benign atmosphere of political tolerance and freedom of dissent of the 
progressive period. Paralleling . . . emergency controls on business, 
they seriously abridged civil liberties and traditional American 
rights.'' \45\ Meanwhile, in Europe, the arrival of American troops was 
decisive in stemming German offensives and launching fierce 
counterdrives that moved Allied forces toward the German border.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\45\ Ibid., p. 302.

  As the conflict in Europe neared an end, Wilson's uncompromising 
determination to handle foreign affairs himself and impose on the world 
his idealistic vision of an enduring peace headed him on a collision 
course with the Senate. On January 8, 1918, he delivered a stirring 
address to the Sixty-fifth Congress, boldly outlining fourteen points as 
a basis for a moral peace. Among them were proposals for open diplomacy, 
freedom of the seas, the reduction of armaments, and ``a general 
association of nations.'' Liberals in America and the Allied countries 
supported the Fourteen Points with enthusiasm, but many of the 
Republicans and militants in Congress were cynical, fearing that Wilson 
would not be stern enough with Germany and showing signs of resentment 
at his aggrandizement of the role of sole arbiter of post-war 
settlements.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\46\ Ibid., p. 303.

  The conflict continued and became more acute, with many Republicans 
separating from Wilson and demanding that he call for Germany's 
unconditional surrender. Wilson responded, in part, by appealing to the 
voting public to give him stronger party control of each House in the 
November 5, 1918, congressional elections. Republicans viewed the 
President's tactic as an attack on their patriotism and a violation of 
the wartime truce on politics. When the returns came in, ``the 
Republicans won the House by fifty seats and the Senate by two seats, 
[and] Wilson not only lost his hold over Congress and his goal of a 
strong national unity behind him, but because of his ill-advised appeal 
seemed even to have suffered a repudiation of his peace policies on the 
eve of the war's end.'' \47\ That end came on November 11 with a general 
armistice in Europe. Wilson's efforts to negotiate a peace ultimately 
came to an end in fall 1919 when the Senate, divided into three 
irreconcilable camps, failed to approve any form of the Versailles 
Treaty.\48\ During a campaign to rally public support for the treaty, 
Wilson collapsed in Pueblo, CO, on September 25, and, after having 
returned to Washington, suffered a debilitating stroke on October 2. The 
declaration of war against Germany (and Austria-Hungary) was 
subsequently terminated by joint resolution on July 2, 1921.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

but without any resolve of the impasse realized earlier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Speaker Champ Clark.--When President Wilson addressed a joint session 
of the 63d Congress on April 8, 1913, James Beauchamp ``Champ'' Clark of 
Missouri was beginning his second speakership. A State legislator, he 
had been unsuccessful in his bid for the Democratic nomination for a 
House seat in 1890. Two years later, he won his party's nomination and 
was elected as a Representative, but lost the reelection contest to a 
Republican in 1894. Regaining his House seat in 1896, he served 
continuously thereafter until 1920. In the House, he was a floor leader 
(1907-1911) before being elected to the speakership in April 1911. 
During the 60th Congress, he had led the Democrats who joined a group of 
Republican insurgents in a revolt against the dictatorial Speaker Joseph 
G. Cannon and his power over the Committee on Rules. While the House had 
voted in 1910 to remove the Speaker from serving on the committee, 
public dissatisfaction with the Republican majority in that Chamber 
resulted in a Democratic landslide in the elections of that year and the 
basis for Clark subsequently becoming Speaker.
  As a consequence of his distaste for Cannon's dictatorial ways, Clark 
changed the Speaker's role in House affairs, leaving the business of 
floor scheduling and party caucus management to the floor leader, Oscar 
Underwood of Alabama. Under this arrangement, the floor leader and 
caucus guided the party program. Clark, as Speaker, was an impartial 
presiding officer of the House, but he could, and often did, temporarily 
step down from his position to participate actively in legislative 
debate.\50\ As a result of his role in the overthrow of Cannon and his 
frequent discussion of legislative issues, Clark became the leading 
Democratic candidate for the Presidency in 1912. At the party nominating 
convention, Clark ran ahead of both William Jennings Bryan, his 
political adversary, and Woodrow Wilson, but was ultimately defeated 
when Bryan threw his support to Wilson.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\50\ Peters, The American Speakership, pp. 92-94.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  During Clark's speakership, the Democrats exercised party governance 
through a binding caucus, with Underwood using individual pieces of 
legislation for such approval.\51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\51\ Ibid., p. 93.

  The caucus rules established a simple majority as a quorum for 
business, with two-thirds of those members present and voting required 
to approve a motion to bind. It was not always necessary for the 
leadership to control two-thirds of the rank and file, but rather some 
lesser number, ranging down to two-thirds of a quorum. Of 291 Democratic 
members of the Sixty-third Congress, for example, the number required to 
bind might have been as few as ninety-eight.\52\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\52\ Ibid., p. 94.

  The Speaker could speak in the caucus or offer a motion to bind it, 
but he could not control it. Similarly, he could influence the members 
of the Committee on Rules regarding the floor agenda and debate, but he 
could not control them. As a consequence, compared with the Democratic 
floor leader and committee chairmen, it is understandable that the 
Speaker might not have been viewed as the best agent for realizing the 
President's legislative agenda. By one estimate, the ``operation of the 
caucus system used by the Democrats attained its maximum effectiveness 
during Wilson's first administration, especially during the Sixty-third 
Congress while Underwood served as majority leader.'' Why? 
``Progressivism had its moment in the sun, and the Democrats were able 
to govern the nation just so long as the policy consensus kept the party 
united behind the administration's program.'' \53\ War in Europe 
militated against that consensus, as did Underwood's departure for the 
Senate in 1915, resulting in the succession of Claude Kitchen of North 
Carolina as floor leader.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\53\ Ibid., p. 97.

  Basic differences in political philosophy between Wilson and Kitchen 
led to a clash of political wills, and they did not work as closely 
together as had Wilson and Underwood. Because of this, Wilson began 
using congressman John Nance Garner of Texas as his intermediary to the 
House. The Democrats had suffered heavy losses in the election of 1914, 
bringing their congressional majority down from 290 seats to 231. With 
the growing involvement of the United States in European affairs, 
Americans became increasingly concerned about the possibility of 
engagement in a general European war. Running on the theme that he had 
``kept us out of war,'' Wilson was reelected in 1916, but the party 
retained control of the House of Representatives by the narrowest of 
margins, electing an identical 215 members to the Republicans, and 
relying on the support of five independent members to retain 
organizational control. Wilson did not keep America out of the war, and 
during his second administration he won congressional support for his 
war program only at the cost of bitter divisions within the party, which 
proved fatal in the 1918 congressional elections, when the Republicans 
swept the Congress.\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\54\ Ibid., pp. 97-98.

  Clark admired Kitchen, calling him ``one of the most brilliant 
debaters this generation has known--fluent, intelligent, witty, 
sarcastic, affable, courageous, and at times eloquent.'' \55\ He 
occasionally voted, as a matter of conscience, contrary to the position 
of the President. Joining Kitchen, Clark opposed the administration's 
highly controversial military conscription plan, and denounced the 
proposal on the House floor in April 1917.\56\ He also proved to be a 
valuable ally of the White House, however, such as when he frustrated 
efforts in September 1917 to establish a powerful joint congressional 
committee to oversee the conduct of the American war effort, and 
privately assured Wilson that he would render any service to defeat 
legislation creating, separate from the traditional Cabinet, a war 
cabinet or council, composed of three distinguished citizens, ``with 
almost unlimited jurisdiction over plans and policies, to insure the 
most vigorous prosecution of the war.'' \57\ When the President lent 
support in July 1918 to a local effort to deny Representative George 
Huddleston of Alabama the Democratic nomination for reelection to the 
House, Clark and Kitchen provided their colleague with letters praising 
his patriotic service in Congress. Their intervention was denounced 
locally as the interference of a pair of ``super pacifists,'' but 
Huddleston captured the nomination and was returned to the House.\58\ In 
the closing pages of his autobiography, Clark characterized Wilson as 
``a great President,'' but, perhaps best explained his own role when 
refuting a newspaper allegation that he had campaigned for Wilson in 
1912 in the hope of obtaining a Cabinet position. ``The man who wrote 
that,'' counseled Clark, ``did not have sense enough to know that the 
Speakership of the House of Representatives is a much bigger place than 
is any Cabinet position, and he was not well enough acquainted with me 
to know that I would not accept all ten Cabinet portfolios rolled into 
one, for I would not be a clerk for any man.'' \59\

  In his final State of the Union Message of December 4, 1928, President 
Calvin Coolidge advised the legislators that no previous Congress ``has 
met a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present 
time,'' and concluded that the ``country can regard the present with 
satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism.'' \60\ One year 
later, the dreamworld envisioned by Coolidge vanished and was replaced 
by a nightmare. On October 24, 1929, an over-speculated stock market 
suddenly experienced a deluge of selling, which sent prices plummeting. 
Panic ensued. In the howling melee of the stock exchange, brokers fought 
to sell before it was too late. Rapidly, it became too late.

  Economic crisis was not new to America. The country had experienced 
financial setbacks of nationwide proportion in 1857, 1875, and 1893. 
History, however, was an enemy in the devising of strategy to deal with 
the depression of 1929. The periods of economic difficulty of the past 
were but a tumble when compared with the plunge of the Great Depression. 
This was the first problem experienced by those attempting to rectify 
the plight of the country: they did not recognize the ramifications of 
the situation or the extent of damage done and continuing to be done. 
Perhaps, too, the administrative machinery was not available or 
sufficiently developed to halt the downward economic spiral. It may have 
been that the President's philosophy of government was inadequate for 
meeting the exigency. In the face of all efforts to halt its progress, 
the cancer of economic disaster continued to devastate American society 
mercilessly.
  The depression demoralized the Nation: it destroyed individual dignity 
and self-respect, shattered family structure, and begged actions which 
civilized society had almost forgotten. In brief, it created a most 
desperate situation, ripe for exploitation by zealots, fanatics, or 
demagogs. It also created an emergency which, unlike exigencies of the 
past, dealt a kind of violence to the public that neither Armed Forces 
nor military weaponry could repel. It was a new type of crisis leading 
to a broad extension of executive power.
  In 1932, a malcontent and despairing electorate voted against 
President Herbert C. Hoover, Coolidge's successor. Although a dedicated 
public servant of demonstrated ability, he was replaced with Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, who came to the Presidency from the governorship of New York, 
and had previously served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the 
Wilson administration. In his inaugural address, the new President was 
eloquent, telling the American people ``that the only thing we have to 
fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which 
paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.'' More 
important, on the exertion of leadership during crisis, he expressed 
hope that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority 
would prove to be adequate ``to meet the unprecedented tasks before 
us,'' but acknowledged that ``temporary departure from that normal 
balance'' might be necessary. ``I am prepared under my constitutional 
duty to recommend the measures that a stricken Nation in the midst of a 
stricken world may require,'' he said, but, in the event Congress did 
not cooperate ``and in the event that the national emergency is still 
critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then 
confront me''--using ``broad Executive power to wage a war against the 
emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in 
fact invaded by a foreign foe.'' \61\

  The House Environment.--The day after his inauguration, Roosevelt 
called for a special session of Congress. When the proclamation for the 
gathering was issued, no purpose for the March 9 assembly was indicated. 
Nonetheless, the President's party enjoyed overwhelming majorities in 
the House (310 to 117) and Senate (60 to 35). Roosevelt had arrived in 
Washington with drafts of two proclamations, one calling for the special 
session of Congress and the other declaring a so-called ``bank 
holiday,'' which would temporarily close the Nation's banks and restrict 
the export of gold by invoking provisions of the Trading With the Enemy 
Act.\62\ The bank holiday proclamation was issued on March 6. Between 
the evening of the inauguration and the opening of Congress, Roosevelt's 
lieutenants, aided by Hoover's Secretary of the Treasury, Ogden Mills, 
drafted an emergency banking bill. When Congress convened, the House had 
no copies of the measure and had to rely upon the Speaker reading from a 
draft text. After 38 minutes of debate, the House passed the bill. That 
evening, the Senate followed suit. The President then issued a second 
proclamation, pursuant to the new banking law, continuing the bank 
holiday and the terms and provisions of the March 6 proclamation.\63\

  Thereafter ensued the famous ``hundred days'' when the 73d Congress 
enacted a series of 15 major relief and recovery laws, many of which 
provided specific emergency powers to the President or broad general 
authority to address the crisis gripping the Nation. The Emergency 
Banking Relief Act, for example, authorized the President to declare a 
condition of national emergency and, ``under such rules and regulations 
as he may prescribe,'' regulate banking and related financial matters 
affecting the economy. This statute also continued the Chief Executive's 
authority to suspend the operations of member banks of the Federal 
Reserve System.\64\ Under the authority of the Civilian Conservation 
Corps Reforestation Relief Act, the President was granted broad power 
``to provide for employing citizens of the United States who are 
unemployed, in the construction, maintenance, and carrying on of works 
of a public nature in connection with the forestation of lands belonging 
to the United States or to the several States.'' Authority also was 
granted to house, care for, and compensate such individuals as might be 
recruited to carry out programs established pursuant to the act.\65\ 
After declaring the existence of a national emergency with regard to 
unemployment and the disorganization of industry, the National 
Industrial Recovery Act authorized the President to establish an 
industrial code system and a public works program to facilitate the 
restoration of prosperity. The President could establish administrative 
agencies to carry out the provisions of the act, and might delegate the 
functions and powers vested in him by the statute to those entities.\66\ 
Additional recovery programs would be given approval by the 74th 
Congress.

  These federal programs served widespread, enduring, and organized 
interests in American society. The political coalition to which they 
gave rise lent definition to American political life, and the 
consequences were felt in the Congress. The tendency towards stability 
was already present, especially within the Democratic party, and the 
seniority system had entrenched the power of southern Democrats. The 
newcomers who came to town in 1933 and 1935 did not upset it; instead, 
those who stayed on enlisted themselves in its long apprenticeship. By 
cooperating with those at the top of the power structure, those at the 
bottom served their own interests and those of their constituents. This 
was a game ideally suited to the character and temperament of the 
Democratic party, a party marked by diversity and devoted to logrolling. 
From the Roosevelt administration, to the oligopoly on Capitol Hill, 
through the growing bureaucracy, to the congressional constituencies, 
everyone found something to gain.\67\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\67\ Peters, The American Speakership, pp. 106-107.

  Indeed, ``Roosevelt was careful to defer to the Democratic barons in 
the Congress on the control of federal spending,'' and harmony prevailed 
because Federal largesse was particularly sought by the southern States 
where the Great Depression had hit the hardest.\68\ ``Conservative 
southern opposition to Roosevelt remained quiescent,'' it has been 
observed, ``until the court-packing episode of 1937, which triggered the 
development of the conservative coalition in the Congress. Roosevelt's 
decision to purge the Congress of southern Democrats who had opposed his 
reelection in 1936 sealed many southerners in opposition to him.'' \69\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\68\ Ibid., p. 107.

\69\ Ibid., p. 108; in February 1937, President Roosevelt sent Congress 
a draft bill to change the composition of the Federal judiciary, and, in 
particular, to allow him to expand the membership of the Supreme Court, 
which had recently struck down New Deal recovery legislation; the 
following year, he made appeals to party faithful for the defeat of some 
southern Democrats seeking reelection to Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Apart from Congress, New Deal efforts at combating the Depression, in 
the estimate of one analyst, also resulted in a transformation of the 
Presidency as well as inter-branch relations.

  Since FDR, the public's expectations of the presidency have been 
different than they were before. The public expects leadership from the 
president, and it is the president who sets the basic elements of the 
national political agenda. But if the president can and must set the 
major items on the agenda, he cannot enact them by himself. Instead, he 
must seek to persuade the Congress to follow his leadership. This led to 
a strengthening of the link between the president and the speakership. 
On occasion speakers had been supporters of presidents, but there 
existed no norm that demanded it prior to the New Deal. Since the New 
Deal, speakers, especially Democratic speakers, have viewed it as their 
obligation to support presidents of their own party. Thus, the New Deal 
had the ironic effect of solidifying congressional power in the 
committee system, which the speaker could influence but not control, and 
of imposing on the speaker the duty of supporting a president of his own 
party. From 1932 forward, speakers would be caught in a crossfire 
between the congressional power structure and their obligation to the 
White House.\70\

  Speaker Henry T. Rainey.--Formerly a practicing attorney and county 
master in chancery in Illinois, Henry T. Rainey was first elected to the 
House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1902. He served in the 58th 
Congress and the 8 succeeding Congresses (1903-1921). Unsuccessful in 
his 1920 campaign, he was returned 2 years later to the 68th Congress 
and served in the next five Congresses (1923-1934) until his death in 
office. When the Democrats, after 12 years, were returned to majority 
status in the House in 1931, ``power in the party was centered in the 
Texas delegation'' with John Nance Garner, ``a leading force in the 
party since the Wilson administration,'' elected Speaker.\71\ That year, 
``the southern Democrats controlled twenty-seven of forty-seven 
chairmanships'' of the House committees.\72\ Emerging as the new floor 
leader for the Democrats was Rainey, renowned for his ``progressive 
political independence,'' according to his biographer, but a man who had 
gained the support of his more conservative colleagues through his 
reelection successes and efforts on behalf of farmers and agricultural 
relief.\73\ However, in his new position, Rainey ``was never able to win 
acceptance within the establishment'' of House southern Democrats ``and 
his relationship with Speaker Garner was strained.'' \74\

  Ironically, ``Garner's leadership of the Democratic party in the House 
brought to him great public visibility,'' as well as ``ample political 
assets to enable him to contend for the presidency in 1932.'' \75\ 
Supported by the newspapers of William Randolph Hearst, Garner won the 
California primary election and entered the Democratic National 
Convention with the solid support of the delegations from that State and 
Texas. With the convention deadlocked after three ballots, Garner threw 
his support to Roosevelt to be the party's Presidential candidate and 
was rewarded with the Vice Presidential position on the ticket. When the 
Democrats won the Presidential contest, the speakership for the 73d 
Congress became open.

  Rainey had been elected his party's floor leader in 1931 ``with a 
coalition of southern and northern support,'' but ``he remained very 
much an outrider in a leadership structure that was dominated by the 
southern oligarchy.'' \76\ Several factors contributed to his election 
to succeed Garner as Speaker. In addition to Rainey, four southerners 
and a New York City Representative emerged as contenders for the 
speakership, with the result that ``the party suffered a complete 
geographic split, with candidates from each of its major regions.'' \77\ 
Within the institution of the House, Rainey was the second-longest-
serving Member, and had earned the respect of many of his Democratic 
colleagues as their floor leader and as one in that role who ``was not 
disloyal to Garner.'' Moreover, ``Rainey's election was ensured by the 
election of 129 new Democrats; of these, ninety-five were from the 
North, twelve from border states, and seventeen from the South,'' with 
Illinois, his home State, electing the most new Democratic Members--11 
in total.\78\

  These new members were politically tied to President Roosevelt's 
commitment to political action. Rainey had for several years advocated a 
diffusion of the power structure in the House through the creation of a 
party steering and policy committee similar to that employed by the 
Republicans. In 1933 he made this proposal a key element in his campaign 
platform for the speakership. The concept of a party steering committee 
had been strongly opposed by Garner, who favored the management of the 
House by the speaker and the committee chairmen. But the idea was very 
attractive to new members, who could have no hope of influence under the 
leadership of the old guard. . . . Rainey became the first speaker since 
Champ Clark to come to the office committed to reform, and like Clark he 
was committed to decentralizing reforms.\79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\79\ Ibid., p. 115; Rainey's biographer notes that when he announced his 
intention to seek the speakership, ``Rainey indicated that he expected 
considerable support from the newly elected Democrats in the lower 
House,'' and identified other factors lending support to his bid for the 
speakership, such as being ``a rallying point for all northern Democrats 
who were tired of seeing most of the party plums go to the South,'' 
having a ``rural and small town background [which] would help balance a 
party which drew heavily from the urban areas and the Solid South,'' 
having the precedent that ``[f]our of the Democratic Speakers since the 
Forty-seventh Congress . . . elevated from the post of majority leader 
and a fifth from acting majority leader,'' and perhaps even the 
``striking personal appearance'' of the candidate; see Waller, Rainey of 
Illinois, pp. 174-175.

  However, after becoming Speaker, Rainey eventually made only slight 
changes in the committee system. ``Among forty-five standing committee 
chairmen of the House,'' by one estimate, ``there were no uncompensated 
violations of seniority.'' \80\ He would, nonetheless, carefully manage 
the House committee system in other ways, while attempting to pursue his 
reform proposals and lend support to the new President's efforts at 
achieving economic recovery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Speaker Rainey's commitment to diffuse power in the House ran head-on 
into the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt and his first hundred days. 
However much the speaker and his supporters might have wanted collegial 
decision making, the country demanded immediate action that could only 
come about by firm control of the House. Rainey did appoint a steering 
and policy committee for the Democrats, and created a variety of special 
committees designed to involve members in the canvassing of opinion. But 
the real business of the House was being done at the other end of 
Pennsylvania Avenue, and Speaker Rainey's job was primarily to see to it 
that the president's program was expedited. In order to accomplish this, 
the speaker held up the appointment of most committees during the 
special session called by Roosevelt to deal with the crisis. He 
appointed a special committee to deal with the Economy Act, a budget-
cutting measure that gave broad power to the president to cut federal 
expenditures, and he used the Rules Committee to bring the New Deal 
legislation to the House under special orders that severely limited the 
capacity of the membership to amend the bills as reported by 
committees.\81\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\81\ Ibid., p. 117.

  As Speaker, Rainey, according to his biographer, ``was in an ideal 
position to serve as middleman between executive wishes and legislative 
fulfillment.'' \82\ Prior to the convening of the 73d Congress, Rainey, 
in a January 1933 meeting with Roosevelt, had proposed a program to 
balance the budget and warned that increasing taxes ``would be inviting 
revolution.'' It was, by one estimate, ``an instance in which a 
congressional leader had prepared a complete fiscal program for the 
President-elect.'' \83\ Subsequently, authority for the President to cut 
Federal expenditures to realize a balanced budget was included in 
legislation to maintain government credit.\84\ However, it also enabled 
the President to reduce the pensions and allowances of war veterans. In 
the course of an unsuccessful attempt to bind the party on the measure 
in caucus, Rainey learned of an amendment backed by the veterans' lobby 
to prevent the President from completely discontinuing a pension or 
other allowance or reduce them by more than 25 percent. Given that 
``Democratic unity was shattered by the economy bill,'' the legislation 
was brought to the floor ``under a rule providing a two-hour limit, no 
opportunity for amendments, and one motion to recommit by anyone 
opposing the proposition.'' To avoid the veterans' lobby amendment, 
arrangements were made for another Democrat, ``an ardent veterans' 
supporter,'' to seek to be recognized in order to move to recommit the 
entire bill. Rainey, as prearranged, recognized this man and, as 
expected, his motion was defeated, but the terms of the rule had been 
satisfied on this point. When the Member with the veterans' lobby 
amendment protested, contending that he believed he had caucus agreement 
that he would have an opportunity to offer his amendment to the 
recommitted measure, ``Rainey coldly replied that he had no knowledge of 
a binding agreement.'' Moreover, he voted with those approving the bill. 
Thus, ``the Speaker used his right to recognize with decisive effect, 
and saved the administration from an embarrassing defeat during its 
first few days in office.'' \85\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\82\ Waller, Rainey of Illinois, p. 181; this biographer also 
acknowledges that ``the record upon which to construct the climax of 
Rainey's career is limited severely'' because ``Franklin Roosevelt did 
not preserve memoranda of his personal conferences and phone 
conversations'' and ``most of the key legislative transactions were 
handled in this fashion;'' Ibid., p. 181.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On another occasion, ``Rainey used his influence as Speaker to block 
legislation that was not a part of the President's urgent program.'' As 
the Senate began considering an industrial recovery bill limiting labor 
to a 5-day week and 6-hour day, ``Rainey predicted that if it should 
pass the Senate, it would be sidetracked in the House temporarily to 
clear the way for more urgent bills.'' When a companion bill to the 
Senate legislation was reported in the House, ``Rainey was not inclined 
to give the matter preferential treatment on the House floor, and 
supported the administration in its demand for considerable revision.'' 
During the delay, the White House developed its own measure--to be known 
as the National Industrial Recovery Act--embracing the reduced labor 
hours objectives of the competing House and Senate 30-hour week 
bills.\86\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\86\ Ibid., pp. 183-184.

  Once the new measure was ready, Rainey announced that both the thirty-
hour week bills had been put on ice. Several House committees wanted 
jurisdiction over the new bill. The Speaker assigned it to the Ways and 
Means Committee, although it was not directly a revenue measure. Rainey 
used his discretionary power in assigning bills to committee to foster 
the Roosevelt program. By the close of the session, the bill for 
industrial self-government was ready for the President's signature. The 
thirty-hour measures were left in limbo.\87\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\87\ Ibid., p. 184.

  Not every piece of Presidential legislation offered to achieve 
economic recovery, however, required the Speaker's attention. For 
example, to enact Roosevelt's ``federal emergency relief, supervision of 
stock market operations, relief of small home owners, and railroad 
reorganization and relief'' proposals, ``Rainey's services as master 
parliamentarian were not needed.'' Nonetheless, the Chief Executive was 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
appreciative of the assistance he provided.

  Rainey had identified himself fully with the President's program. 
While the Speaker is not called upon to vote during roll calls, the 
Illinoisan established a record by being enscribed as supporting New 
Deal measures on twenty-three separate occasions during the hundred 
days. At the close of the session, Roosevelt made a point of thanking 
the legislators through Rainey for their cooperation and teamwork in 
meeting the nation's problems.\88\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\88\ Ibid., p. 185.

  When the House convened in January 1934 to begin the 2d session of the 
73d Congress, Rainey predicted ``a short, harmonious and constructive 
session.'' The approaching fall elections, however, provided House 
Members a clear and understandable reason to assert themselves to gain 
visibility and an individual record that would justify being returned to 
office. This situation, together with the ``presidential decision to 
outline needed legislation in his annual message and let Congress iron 
out the details proved a detriment to a short and harmonious session, 
but it was nonetheless a productive term.'' \89\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\89\ Ibid., p. 187.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As the session got underway, Rainey soon engendered Presidential 
displeasure on three issues. The first involved a bill providing special 
consideration for silver in financial transactions. In March, Rainey 
publicly praised the recently reported measure, and said it would likely 
pass the House and not incur White House objection. In fact, both the 
President and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau were, by one 
estimate, ``horrified at this bill's implications.'' Rainey subsequently 
got into a heated public dispute with Morgenthau over silver policy, 
moved the controversial silver bill, and was surprised by its approval 
by the House, which necessitated White House efforts to strike a 
compromise on the legislation in the Senate. More tension between the 
Speaker and the President ensued, but Roosevelt ultimately obtained 
sufficient compromise on the disputed legislation in the Senate that a 
veto was avoided. ``The silver inflation debate was the only major 
occasion on which the Speaker differed markedly with the President,'' 
but it was the first of three controversies that left Roosevelt with 
less than full confidence in Rainey.\90\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\90\ Ibid., pp. 189-191.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The second controversy involved legislation--the Patman bonus bill--
authorizing an immediate payment to World War I veterans based upon 
their service certificates. During the latter half of February, 
supporters of the bonus bill obtained the requisite number of signatures 
on a discharge petition to force the measure out of committee. At that 
time, the President warned the House, through Rainey, that it was not 
the appropriate time to approve such legislation. Both Rainey and 
Roosevelt were unwilling to expend the $2.4 billion authorized by the 
bill. When some question arose as to whether or not the President would 
allow the proposal to become law without his signature, Rainey wrote for 
clarification and received what became a highly public and unequivocal 
response from Roosevelt saying he would veto the legislation. The House, 
nonetheless, elected to follow an independent course and, in early 
March, voted by a 3 to 1 margin to approve the discharge petition. 
Thereafter, the House approved the bonus bill on a 295 to 125 vote, but 
when it arrived in the Senate, it was reported adversely and died 
without a floor vote. Nonetheless, ``Rainey had been unsuccessful in 
getting the House to follow the President's guiding hand.'' \91\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\91\ Ibid., pp. 191-192.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The third controversy arose with the Independent Offices 
Appropriations bill and adherence to the President's economy program. In 
early January, ``Rainey had pledged that the House would keep 
`absolutely' within the budget recommendation limits submitted by the 
President,'' which was done when the Independent Offices measure was 
considered, but ``only by an adroit series of parliamentary moves.'' As 
passed by the House, the bill was ``perfectly acceptable to the 
President.'' Senate leaders were unsuccessful in their efforts to defeat 
amendments providing for the restoration of government employee pay 
cuts. When the legislation came back to the House, Rainey did not follow 
custom and send it to a conference committee, but took the somewhat 
unusual step of referring it back to the committee of origin, presumably 
to be crafted into a version acceptable to both the Senate and the 
President. The Appropriations Committee, however, declined to redraft 
the Senate version, and Democratic leaders failed in two caucuses to 
bind their House Members to ignore the Senate amendments to the 
legislation. When the Rules Committee reported a special rule on the 
measure that would have sent it to a conference committee without 
instructions from the House, the rule was overwhelmingly defeated. The 
bill was then open to amendment from the House floor, and among those 
successfully added was the full restoration of veterans' benefits 
reduced by the Economy Act of 1933. Ultimately, House amendments added 
$228 million to the President's original recommendations, which both 
Houses accepted. The President, however, did not, and he vetoed the 
bill. Rainey confidently predicted the veto would be sustained, but he 
completely misjudged the situation. The House voted 310 to 72 to 
override, with no fewer than 209 Democrats bolting.\92\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\92\ Ibid., pp. 192-194.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In the aftermath of this tumult--``Rainey helped to lead one revolt 
and was unsuccessful in halting the two others''--speculation and rumor 
soon arose that the President was sufficiently displeased with his 
party's House leaders that he would welcome a change. Emerging from a 
White House meeting in April, Rainey volunteered that the President 
``wanted me to stay where I am'' as Speaker of the House.\93\ After the 
2d session of the 73d Congress ended in mid-June, Rainey embarked upon 
an extensive speaking tour as an ambassador for the New Deal. On August 
10, due to fatigue and a slight cold, he elected to be admitted to a 
hospital in St. Louis for a few days' rest. Speaker Rainey died 
unexpectedly on August 19, 1934, 1 day short of his 74th birthday.\94\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Speaker Joseph W. Byrns.--An attorney and former member of the 
Tennessee legislature, Joe Byrns was elected to the House in 1908 as a 
Democrat and served in the 61st and 13 succeeding Congresses. During the 
72d Congress, he chaired the Appropriations Committee. He was among 
those who sought the speakership for the 73d Congress, and was made 
floor leader by the coalition that elected Rainey as Speaker. Although 
he was part of the House leadership that had displeased the President in 
1934, his party colleagues in the House had high regard for him, not 
only as their floor leader, but also as the chairman of their 
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``With his help,'' it has been 
observed, ``the Democrats had actually increased their representation in 
the House in the off-year election of 1934,'' with the result that many 
in his party who had been returned to their seats or were newcomers 
``felt themselves indebted to him.'' \95\ Many newspapers expected Byrns 
to be the next Speaker after Rainey's death. He had a few competitors 
for the position, the strongest of whom might have been Sam Rayburn of 
Texas, but he subsequently withdrew for several reasons, not the least 
of which was his State's control of several committee chairmanships and 
the Vice Presidency. Ultimately, the same coalition of northeastern, 
border, and midwestern Democrats who had installed Rainey as Speaker 
elected Byrns, with southern supporters, to that position.\96\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While some of the President's ``brains trust'' advisers urged him to 
announce his support for Rayburn, whom they favored as Speaker, 
Roosevelt remained discreetly silent about the contest. By one estimate, 
``Byrns was probably not his preference, but he may have thought that 
Byrns would win.'' \97\ Nonetheless, ``among all the candidates for the 
speakership, the only one who had stood with FDR in opposition to the 
[veterans] bonus in the previous session had been Byrns.'' \98\ 
Moreover, ``Byrns was known for party loyalty, for always being a 
regular party supporter. While he had served as majority leader,'' it 
has been observed, ``his strong and continuing support of New Deal 
legislation, even those measures which he philosophically opposed, 
illustrated his party loyalty.'' \99\ In a radio address given shortly 
after the convening of the 74th Congress, Speaker Byrns indicated that 
it was ``not the function of Congress to initiate executive policies.'' 
That was the President's responsibility, and Congress ``is and should be 
proud to accept his leadership,'' he said. Of the issues he foresaw 
ahead, he hoped a noninflationary way could be found to pay the 
veterans' bonus.\100\

  Byrns soon brought the bonus question before the House, the 
legislative solution being to provide the necessary $2 billion by 
printing more money--a clearly inflationary course of action. He was 
among the 90 Members who voted against the legislation. In the aftermath 
of Senate approval of the bill, the President personally delivered his 
veto message to a joint session of the two Houses of Congress when, at 
the conclusion of his remarks, he handed the rejected legislation to 
Byrns. Immediately thereafter, the House voted overwhelmingly to 
override the veto, ``but Byrns was one of the 98 in opposition.'' The 
next day, the Senate vote for an override was insufficient, but Speaker 
Byrns' loyalty to the President was, by then, on the record.\101\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\101\ Ibid., pp. 220-221.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Byrns next became involved in negotiating a massive emergency relief 
appropriations bill. Many House Members wanted to specify the kinds of 
jobs that would be created by the legislation, thereby limiting the 
discretionary authority of Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, whom 
they felt was unresponsive to congressional concerns. In a meeting on 
this matter, Roosevelt, Byrns, and Appropriations Committee Chairman 
James Buchanan reached a compromise: the funds would be appropriated 
without directions to the President regarding their expenditure, but the 
President would allocate the money himself rather than designating Ickes 
to perform this task. Byrns obtained caucus agreement to the compromise 
and the bill received overwhelming party support, with only 10 Democrats 
voting against it in the House. ``Byrns had held his party in line; here 
was an example of his ability to forge consensus among the very 
different kinds of Democrats in the House.'' He and Vice President 
Garner subsequently intervened with the conference committee on the 
legislation to obtain a version acceptable to the President.\102\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\102\ Ibid., pp. 221-222.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Next came the Social Security Program. Byrns exerted his influence 
early, referring the legislation to the Ways and Means Committee, whose 
members he perceived were more favorable to the proposal than the 
skeptical members of the Labor Committee. When there was hesitation to 
report the bill, Byrns convinced committee members ``that if they wanted 
to kill the measure, it should be defeated on the floor during public 
debate, not in a secret committee session.'' On the matter of a rule for 
bringing the legislation to the floor, ``Byrns insisted the debate be as 
open as possible so that members would feel trusted, not coerced.'' He 
``based his desire for an open debate on the social security bill on 
assurance from Pat Boland's whip organization that the bill would 
pass.'' Indications were that an alternative plan to the President's 
proposal did not have much support. Such proved to be the case; Byrns' 
strategy succeeded.\103\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\103\ Ibid., pp. 223-224.

  The House had to consider a number of additional important bills, and 
in expediting (or blocking) them, the speaker was influential mostly in 
little-noticed ways. These included persuading committees to finish 
their consideration so that bills could come to the floor, helping 
convince the Rules Committee to schedule bills for floor debate, and 
urging efficient floor consideration.\104\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\104\ Ibid., p. 224.

  The President's gratification with Byrns became apparent in early May 
1935 when ``Roosevelt lightheartedly scolded Senate leaders, suggesting 
they could learn from Speaker Byrns's methods and adopt legislation more 
expeditiously.'' \105\ When illness prevented William Bankhead from 
carrying out his duties as Democratic floor leader, Byrns sometimes 
functioned as Speaker and majority leader, ``and won compliments for his 
dual leadership role during Bankhead's absence.'' \106\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\105\ Ibid., p. 226.

\106\ Ibid., p. 227.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When the sometimes fractious House came to the close of the 1st 
session of the 74th Congress in late August, it was clearly evident that 
``Byrns had helped the administration achieve its goals,'' the last 3 
months being so productive that many termed them the ``second hundred 
days.'' \107\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\107\ Ibid., p. 232.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Returning from travel in Asia late in the year, Byrns foresaw 
``nothing on the horizon that should cause any controversies'' in the 
next session, but quickly added that ``one never knows what is going to 
happen in the legislative halls at Washington.'' The unforeseen did 
burst on the scene a few days after the new session got underway: the 
Supreme Court invalidated the Agricultural Adjustment Act, with the 
result that the Nation was left with no farm program. Byrns arranged for 
efficient House consideration and passage of a constitutionally 
acceptable replacement program.\108\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\108\ Ibid., pp. 241-242.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  More predictable was the early reappearance of veterans' bonus 
legislation. The track record on this issue was familiar by now, and 
support for such legislation was strengthened by a modest upturn in the 
economy and a looming national election. Byrns thought the passage of 
such a bill was inevitable. The White House may have concurred, but when 
the measure was sent to the President, he perfunctorily vetoed it, only 
to have his rejection overridden by both houses.\109\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\109\ Ibid., pp. 242-243.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Due, in part, to Bankhead's return to perform his floor leader duties, 
``Byrns was not nearly as prominent in the 1936 session as he had been a 
year earlier,'' and ``because the long 1935 session had been so 
productive, the 1936 session saw less controversy and less necessity for 
a speaker to use his position publicly to achieve a result.'' As it 
happened, ``Byrns had no chance to compile his own summary of this 
session's accomplishments,'' it has been observed, ``but he must have 
felt satisfaction as he saw the Seventy-fourth Congress meeting the 
goals he had suggested at the outset of his speakership.'' \110\ 
Approximately 2 weeks prior to the end of the Congress, Speaker Byrns 
died suddenly on June 4, 1936.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Speaker William B. Bankhead.--Advised by the House Parliamentarian of 
the need for a new Speaker in order that the business of the 74th 
Congress could be concluded, House leaders turned to Will Bankhead.\111\ 
An attorney, State legislator, and city attorney of Huntsville, Bankhead 
was first elected to the House of Representatives from Alabama in 1915, 
serving in the 65th and 11 succeeding Congresses. His father had been a 
Member of the House and the Senate, and during his own service in the 
House, his brother was a Senator. Unsuccessful in his bid to become 
House majority leader in 1932, he became the acting chairman and then 
chairman of the Rules Committee during the 74th Congress. Two years 
later, his election as majority leader was secured. In his later 
congressional career, Bankhead was beset by health problems. He suffered 
major heart attacks in 1932 and 1935, and ``labored with a weak heart 
during the remainder of his life.'' \112\ As a consequence, Bankhead 
formed a close working relationship with his deputy, Majority Leader Sam 
Rayburn. ``Working in close cooperation with the administration, Sam 
Rayburn,'' according to one assessment, ``provided the strength that 
Bankhead lacked.'' \113\

  At the time of the death of Speaker Byrns in June 1936, the 
``Depression continued, but people had confidence that their federal 
government was working to end their distress.'' \114\ For many, the 
sense of desperation within the country had subsided and the relief 
legislation Congress was being asked to enact by the Roosevelt 
administration was of a smaller quantity and somewhat less urgent 
character than the New Deal proposals of 1933-1934. Indeed, the 
exclusively domestic focus of the first Roosevelt administration was 
supplemented with growing defense and foreign policy considerations 
during the second term. It was in this changing policy environment that 
Bankhead played his leadership role.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\114\ Irish, A Political Biography, p. 249.

  Bankhead's party loyalty was beyond question; the high regard in which 
he was held by minority leaders Bertrand H. Snell and Joseph W. Martin, 
Jr. and others is a testimony to his fairness as a presiding officer. 
His congressional colleagues remember him as the only Speaker who could 
get order in the House merely by standing up. Gavel rapping was seldom 
necessary. He followed House precedent and seldom made a formal speech. 
When he did leave the chair to speak in behalf of a particular bill, he 
was listened to with much more than usual interest.\115\

\115\ Walter J. Heacock, ``William B. Bankhead and the New Deal,'' 
Journal of Southern History, vol. 21, August 1955, p. 354.

  Bankhead's efforts (and those of Rayburn) to assist the White House 
with securing the passage of legislation addressing the emergency 
conditions of the Great Depression were complicated, and sometimes 
hampered, by other legislative issues and the President's demands 
regarding them. For example, ``the congressional leaders were not 
consulted and knew nothing of the President's explosive judiciary 
reorganization plan until they were called to the White House a few 
hours before it was made public.'' \116\ Subsequently, among the more 
``serious consequences'' of this legislation was ``the split it produced 
in the Democratic ranks'' with the result that ``congressional leaders 
encountered unexpected opposition to less controversial administration 
measures.'' \117\ The President's executive reorganization legislation, 
which was proposed shortly after his judiciary reorganization plan was 
unveiled, was affected, the bill being perceived ``as giving the 
President dictatorial power.'' The executive reorganization legislation 
``continued to be a headache for Bankhead and other party leaders until 
a greatly watered-down version was passed in 1939.'' \118\

support for the President's relief proposals included the Ludlow 
resolution, which proposed to amend the Constitution to require a 
national referendum to validate any congressional declaration of war and 
neutrality legislation.\119\ ``The year 1938,'' by one estimate, ``saw 
the culmination of domestic reforms and the shifting of attention to 
international affairs.'' \120\ Bankhead served Roosevelt as a 
legislative leader through the President's second term. He was not the 
only such leader consulted by the President. ``Roosevelt, preferring to 
deal with Congress in his own way, frequently chose to consult directly 
with chairmen whose committees held the fate of his program,'' and, it 
was said, by engaging in such consultations, ``FDR embarrassed Bankhead 
to demonstrate his own dominance over Congress.'' \121\ Although 
Bankhead was not among those ``urging the President to seek re-election, 
he announced his full support of the Roosevelt program and his readiness 
to support the President should he decide to seek another term.'' \122\ 
At the July 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he stood as 
a candidate to be Roosevelt's Vice Presidential running mate, but was 
not successful. Nonetheless, he subsequently called upon all Democrats 
to support the party ticket. Following his own advice, Speaker Bankhead, 
about to launch the Democratic campaign in Maryland with a speech in 
Baltimore, collapsed suddenly in his hotel room and died a few days 
later on September 15, 1940.

  At the time of Speaker Bankhead's death, nations of Europe had been at 
war for 12 months, and Japan's aggression in China had been underway for 
an even longer period of time. The formal entry of the United States 
into World War II occurred on December 8, 1941, with a declaration of 
war against Japan in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor in the 
Hawaiian Islands and other U.S. possessions that had occurred the 
previous day.\123\ Three days later, on December 11, war was declared 
against Germany and Italy.\124\ As a result of the 1940 elections, 
President Roosevelt had been returned to office for an unprecedented 
third term.

  During Roosevelt's first and second Presidential terms (1933-1940), as 
totalitarian regimes began threatening the peace of Europe and Asia, 
Congress adopted a series of Neutrality Acts restricting arms shipments 
and travel by American citizens on the vessels of belligerent 
nations.\125\ Two months after war commenced in Europe in September 
1939, Congress, at the President's request, modified the neutrality law 
by repealing the arms embargo and authorizing ``cash and carry'' exports 
of arms and munitions to belligerent powers.\126\ Some advanced 
weapons--aircraft carriers and long-range bombers--were procured for 
``defensive'' purposes. More bold during the period of professed 
neutrality was the President's unilateral transfer of 50 retired 
American destroyers to Great Britain in exchange for American defense 
bases in British territories located in the Caribbean. The President 
also negotiated a series of defense agreements whereby American troops 
were either stationed on foreign territory or were utilized to replace 
the troops of nations at war in nonbelligerent tasks so that these 
countries might commit their own military personnel to combat. Such was 
the case with Canada when, in August 1940, it was announced that the 
U.S. Navy, in effect, would police the Canadian and American coasts, 
providing mutual defense to both borders. Canadian seamen would, of 
course, be released to aid the British Navy. In April 1941, American 
military and naval personnel, with the agreement of Denmark, were 
located in Greenland. In November, the Netherlands concurred with the 
introduction of American troops into Dutch Guiana.

  With the declarations of war and the impending international crisis, 
Roosevelt, by one estimate, became ``a President who went beyond Wilson 
and even Lincoln in the bold and successful exertion of his 
constitutional and statutory powers.'' Congress ``gave the President all 
the power he needed to wage a victorious total war, but stubbornly 
refused to be shunted to the back of the stage by the leading man.'' The 
Supreme Court ``gave judicial sanction to whatever powers and actions 
the President and Congress found necessary to the prosecution of the 
war, and then post bellum had a lot of strong but unavailing things to 
say about the limits of the Constitution-at-War.'' \127\

  The House Environment.--The 1940 elections gave the Democrats large 
majorities in the House (268 to 162) and Senate (66 to 28). As a result 
of the 1942 elections, these margins narrowed in the House (218 to 208), 
although less so in the Senate (58 to 37). The 1944 elections 
strengthened the Democratic majority in the House (242 to 190), but 
resulted in only a slight change in the Senate (56 to 38).

  Once war came, Congress quickly adjusted itself to the conditions of 
war, and it was by no means the anachronism that many--including some of 
its own members--predicted it would be. Issues were raised which needed 
to be resolved politically, and, as before the war, the President and 
the government agencies continued to ask Congress for funds and for 
authority. The President was given great powers, but he was not a 
dictator, and Congress did not become a rubber stamp in delegating 
power. The relationship with the President and the numerous war agencies 
raised many problems, for though it was agreed that the prosecution of 
the war came within the province of the President, Congress did not wish 
to delegate all authority over domestic issues to the expanding 
bureaucracy. A wartime President was expected to have more power, to be 
able to act without certain congressional restraints, but once this 
major premise was granted, the allowable sphere of congressional action 
had still to be determined.\128\

  In the House, Speaker Bankhead and Majority Leader Rayburn had 
encountered determined opposition to administration legislation from 
southern Democrats in 1938, but, ``when administration foreign policy 
was involved, the South was inclined to be cooperative.'' \129\ Such 
cooperation generally became more widespread as war erupted in Europe 
late the following year, and culminated in the declarations of war in 
December 1941. When the 1942 elections reduced the Democratic majority 
in the House, ``sniping at the administration increased'' during the 
78th Congress.\130\ The wartime bureaucracy was a primary object of 
attack and derision.

  In the growing tensions and frustrations of the war economy, citizens 
registered complaints of every kind to their Congressmen--against 
administrative ineptitudes, against highhanded bureaucrats, controls, 
and rationing, against the forty-hour week and strikes, and against real 
or assumed injustices to relatives in the armed forces. Many members of 
both houses were quick to champion such causes, waging something of a 
guerrilla war in the two chambers and through the newspapers and radio 
against war agencies and their administrators. Much of the drumfire was 
of more than momentary significance, for it reflected a growing 
offensive to try to dismantle Roosevelt's prewar domestic reforms and 
halt any moves that tended to impose new social ideas.\131\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\131\ Ibid.

  It also contributed to a phenomenon, described below, which often 
produced consternation and discomfort for both the administration and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the principal congressional leaders of the President's political party.

  The proliferation of investigation committees was one of the singular 
characteristics of the war Congress. The emphasis on investigation, on 
the control of policy after the passage of an Act, was a spontaneous 
congressional reaction, as it were, to the increasing number of 
activities with which the administrative branch was concerned. At the 
beginning of the war, the major investigation committees were the Truman 
Committee (Senate Special Committee Investigating the National Defense 
Program), which was interested in questions relating to production; the 
Tolan Committee (House Committee on Inter-state Migration), which 
broadened its activities from migratory labor to include also general 
problems relating to the organization of production; the Murray and 
Patman Committees (Senate and House Committees on Small Business); the 
Maloney Committee (Senate Special Committee to Investigate Gasoline and 
Fuel-Oil Shortages); and the House and Senate Committees on Military 
Affairs and on Naval Affairs. There was considerable overlapping of 
committee interests inasmuch as jurisdictions were not precisely 
determined. Some dozen different committees were concerned with such 
controversial subjects as rubber production; manpower policy was 
considered by the Labor Committee as well as by the Military Affairs, 
Appropriations, Judiciary, and Agricultural Committees, and by the 
Truman and Tolan Committees.\132\

pp. 3115-3136.

  Generally, the congressional situation did not improve as the 
prospects for victory in Europe and the Pacific steadily became stronger 
during 1943 and 1944 and Roosevelt's return to the White House for a 
fourth Presidential term grew more likely. By one estimate, the ``1944 
session of Congress, attuned to the presidential election of that year, 
was more partisan and quarrelsome than the one of the year before.'' 
\133\ In the subsequent playout of history, Roosevelt retained the 
Presidency and his party increased its majority hold on the House, but 
his tenure in office ended suddenly on April 12, 1945, with his death in 
Warm Springs, GA. Shortly thereafter, on May 8, came the Allies' victory 
in Europe, followed by victory over Japan on August 15.

  Speaker Sam Rayburn.--First elected to the speakership on September 
16, 1940, to succeed the fallen Will Bankhead, Samuel T. Rayburn 
remained in this position throughout the years of World War II, and 
subsequently became the longest serving Speaker--over 17 years--in 
American history. A Texas attorney and State legislator, he was first 
elected to the House in 1912 as a Democrat, serving in the 63d and the 
24 succeeding Congresses. Rayburn became the chairman of the Interstate 
and Foreign Commerce Committee during the 72d Congress and remained in 
that leadership position for the next two Congresses. In this capacity, 
he had endeared himself to the Roosevelt administration by assisting 
with the passage of some of the most controversial New Deal 
legislation.\134\ Moreover, within a few years after entering the House, 
Rayburn became a protege of the influential John Nance Garner, who 
became an intermediary to the House for President Wilson, Speaker of the 
House (1931-1932), and Vice President (1933-1941).\135\ His close ties 
to Roosevelt and Garner, as well as his being a member of the powerful 
Texas congressional delegation, militated against his initial attempts 
to gain a top House leadership position in 1934.\136\ ``Speaker Byrns's 
death in 1936 opened the door for Rayburn,'' it has been said, ``and 
Speaker Bankhead's death four years later closed it behind him.'' \137\ 
Moreover, his long experience in the House would serve him well. Indeed, 
according to one considered view, ``Sam Rayburn entered upon the duties 
of Speaker of the House with better training for the speakership than 
any of the forty-two men who had preceded him.'' \138\

  The House environment initially encountered by Speaker Rayburn in 1941 
was familiar from his recent majority leader experience. ``The 
Democratic majority was substantial, but it included a number of members 
who were prepared to oppose the administration on almost any given 
issue,'' according to one assessment.\139\ Moreover, there were 
dangerous cross currents at work.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\139\ Ibid., p. 155.

  The delicate situation was made more so by the necessity of winning 
congressional acceptance of a shift in the official government posture 
toward the war in Europe. The President, while pushing for a strong 
defense program, had sedulously endeavored to turn popular thinking away 
from the possibility that the nation might become involved in armed 
combat.\140\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\140\ Ibid.

  The President quickly tested Rayburn's skills as a legislative manager 
working on his behalf. In early January, administration draftsmen began 
developing a bill authorizing the President to have the Armed Forces 
place orders for such defense articles as they required, as well as for 
such additional quantities of such materials as the United States might 
lend or lease to other nations. Great Britain, which had just repelled 
savage and sustained German air attacks, would be the immediate 
beneficiary. Rayburn contributed to perfecting the final version of the 
lend-lease legislation, which was introduced by Majority Leader John 
McCormack as H.R. 1776, ``A Bill to Further Promote the Defense of the 
United States.'' \141\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\141\ See, generally, Warren F. Kimball, The Most Unsordid Act: Lend-
Lease, 1939-1941 (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins Press, 1969).

  The bill defined defense articles so broadly as to make nearly 
anything a defense article if the President said so. It authorized the 
Chief Executive to order any government official to have manufactured in 
arsenals, shipyards, factories or to procure in any way any defense 
article for the use of any country the President named--
``notwithstanding the provisions of other laws.'' The President also 
could order any defense article to be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
leased, lent, or tested, inspected, proved, repaired, outfitted or 
reconditioned, for the use of any party he might name--again without 
regard to other laws. The bill provided that defense information might 
be communicated to any government the President named and that any 
defense article could be released for export to any country he named. 
And it authorized the President to issue such orders as he considered 
necessary to carry out any part of the act.\142\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\142\ Mooney, Roosevelt and Rayburn, p. 159.

  Rayburn began gathering votes in support of the legislation. He could 
count on the southern Democrats, who were ``almost unanimously 
interventionist while the Republicans were hopelessly split.'' After 
canvassing other colleagues, he perfected four specific modifications, 
to be approved in committee, which would garner additional votes for the 
measure on the floor. ``Rayburn thought it might also be well, as an 
insurance measure, to do some trading with representatives from farm 
states by providing that cash payments would be made for food and other 
raw materials provided under terms of the bill.'' Finally, ``during the 
two days of debate Rayburn successfully stifled efforts by isolationist 
members to amend it into innocuousness.'' The House adopted the 
legislation in early February by a margin of almost 100 votes.\143\ It 
was subsequently signed into law on March 11, 1941.\144\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\143\ Ibid., pp. 160-162.

\144\ 55 Stat. 31.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  An even more daunting task, however, soon fell to Rayburn. The 
military conscription law enacted in September 1940, providing that Army 
draftees would be in uniform for only 1 year of training, would expire 
unless it was statutorily extended before the end of August. In 
continuing the draft law, Roosevelt wanted to extend tours of service to 
18 months. Opposition to extending the law was widespread and highly 
emotional. Initially, Rayburn personally appealed to many of his 
colleagues, being ``no less convinced than Roosevelt that an extension 
of the draft was imperative for national security.'' \145\ Up to the 
moment the final vote began, the outcome was uncertain. The clerk 
completed the first call of names and then started the second required 
call to obtain the votes of those who had not initially answered. The 
result was a tie, which meant defeat for the draft extension bill, but 
many Members were coming to the well of the House to be recognized to 
change their votes. When this process reached a point where the vote was 
203 to 202 in favor of the legislation, Rayburn announced the final vote 
and declared the bill had passed. Protests broke out. The Speaker 
recognized a Member opposed to the bill, who asked for a recapitulation 
of the vote, a purely mechanical examination of the vote to determine 
that each Member had been correctly recorded. When this was completed, 
Rayburn declared there was no correction in the vote, ``the vote stands, 
and without objection a motion to reconsider is laid on the table.'' The 
tabling of the motion to reconsider meant that no reconsideration could 
occur without unanimous consent. The draft extension bill had been saved 
in the House by a single vote and the adroit action of the Speaker.\146\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In the closing weeks of 1941, Rayburn was instrumental in obtaining 
passage of amendments to the Neutrality Acts which would allow armed 
American merchant ships to enter combat zones or the ports of 
belligerent nations. He gained some votes by persuading the President to 
send him a letter making a personal appeal for the amendments. This he 
read on the floor to the Members, but, to garner a sufficient number of 
votes for the amendments, he also agreed to allow an antistrike bill, 
which he had blocked because he considered it unfair, to come to the 
floor. ``If Rayburn deserved credit for winning repeal of the neutrality 
restrictions,'' it was observed, ``he also shared blame for allowing a 
harsh antistrike measure to pass the House a few days later.'' \147\ The 
political climate, necessitating such tradeoffs, would shift 
significantly shortly thereafter with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the 
entry of the United States into World War II.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\147\ Hardeman and Bacon, Rayburn, p. 272.

  United, at least, in their desire to win the war, Democrats and 
Republicans temporarily put aside their differences to give Franklin 
Roosevelt the basic laws he needed to strengthen the war effort. 
Victories came deceptively easy for the House leadership as Congress 
handed the President vast wartime powers, appropriated staggering sums 
for the military, found new revenue to finance the war by adding some 25 
million Americans to the tax rolls, and expanded the draft to include 
18-year-olds. ``No administration in time of war ever had greater 
cooperation than we have given the present administration,'' said House 
Republican Leader Joe Martin.\148\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\148\ Ibid., p. 279.

  This last action--extending the draft to 18-year-olds--was costly for 
Democrats in the House and Rayburn could see the result when he convened 
the 1943 session: 50 Members from his party in the previous Congress 
were gone, and his margin over the minority was 11 votes. The 
precariousness of the situation soon became apparent when a large number 
of southern Democrats failed to appear on the House floor to cast their 
votes for an initial group of administration bills, causing them to be 
defeated. Rayburn, however, declined to punish the absentees.\149\ 
Nonetheless, his efforts on behalf of the administration during the year 
brought him public praise from both the President and the First 
Lady.\150\ There was even a fleeting possibility that Rayburn might 
become Roosevelt's Vice Presidential running mate on the 1944 
ticket.\151\ Rayburn was reelected to the House where he once again was 
installed as Speaker and the Democrats again held a 50 vote margin.

  Renewed optimism gripped Washington as 1945 began. It promised to be 
an eventful year. The Democrats firmly controlled Congress. Political 
appointees could see four more years of job security ahead. In Europe, 
the allies were drawing a tight ring around Hitler's Germany; in the 
Pacific, U.S. Marines were advancing rapidly toward a final showdown 
with Japan. The war would be over in a year, according to most 
predictions.\152\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


\152\ Hardeman and Bacon, Rayburn, p. 301.

  Indeed, it was an eventful year: the Presidency of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt came to an end with his death, and the end of World War II 
came with the dawning of the Atomic Age. The career of Sam Rayburn as 
Speaker of the House, however, continued for many years after the 
conclusion of the national emergencies which had first tested his 
leadership.
