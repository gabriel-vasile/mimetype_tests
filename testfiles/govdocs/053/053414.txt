THE  TRAIL  OF  '98            237
held up my end, while the laymen watched us sedulously, and seemed to grudge us even a moment to wipe the sweat out of our blinded ^yes.
I was glad, indeed, when, on the evening of the third day, Ribwood came to me and said:
" I guess you'd better work up at the shaft tomorrow.    We want a man to wheel muck."
They had a shaft sunk on the hillside. They were down some forty feet and were drifting in, wheeling the pay-dirt down a series of planks placed on trestles to the dump. I gripped the handles of a wheelbarrow loaded to overspilling, and steered it down that long, unsteady gangway full of uneven joins and sudden angles. Time and again I ran off the track, but after the first day I became quite an expert at the business. My spirits rose. I was on the way of becoming a miner.
