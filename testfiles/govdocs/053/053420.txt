CARRIE JAFFEE, PETITIONER

     v.

MARYLU REDMOND, ET AL.

   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
  FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

   BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

   INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES

This case presents the question whether the federal
courts should recognize a privilege under Rule 501 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence for confidential communica-
tions between a clinical social worker and a patient made
in the course of psychotherapeutic treatment. As a fre-
quent litigant in federal courts, the federal government
has an interest in the reliability of the judicial fact-finding
process, and thus in the broad availability of relevant
evidence in civil and criminal cases.

(1)

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

 2

The federal government also has an interest in the
availability and effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treat-
ment, especially when a federal employee is involved in a
stressful incident arising out of or in the course of
employment. Agents of the various federal law enforce-
ment agencies, for example, are often involved in
traumatic incidents like that in this case. Federal law
enforcement agencies encourage-or, in some cases,
require-agents involved in such incidents to obtain psy-
chotherapeutic treatment and counseling. Such incidents
may result in litigation.  If statements made during
psychotherapeutic treatment are not privileged, the pros-
pect of such litigation may affect the agents' willingness
to obtain therapy.

     FEDERAL RULE INVOLVED

Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides:

Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of
the United States or provided by Act of Congress or
in rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to
statutory authority, the privilege of a witness, per-
son, government, State, or political subdivision there-
of shall be governed by the principles of the common
law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the
United States in the light of reason and experience.
However, in civil actions and proceedings, with re-
spect to an element of a claim or defense as to which
State law supplies the rule of decision, the privileges
of a witness, person, government, State, or political
subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance
with State law.

STATEMENT

1. Respondent Redmond, a police officer of respondent
Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois(Village), responded to
a reported fight in progress_ at an apartment complex. She
was informed that there had been a stabbing. Shortly after
arriving on the scene, she shot and killed Ricky Allen, Sr.
She testified that, at the time of the shooting, Allen was
pursuing and gaining on another man, whom he was poised
to stab with a butcher knife. Four of Allen's brothers and
sisters testified that he was unarmed at the time of the
shooting.  A butcher knife was found at the scene, al-
though witnesses for petitioner testified that the butcher
knife did not appear until after Allen's body was removed.
Pet. App. 2-5.
After the shooting, Redmond sought counseling from
Karen Beyer, a licensed clinical social worker certified by
Illinois as an employee assistance counselor and employed
by the Village. Redmond met with Beyer two to three
times each week for at least six months, beginning a few
days after the shooting. Pet. App. 5-6.
2. Petitioner, on behalf of Allen's estate, commenced
this action against Redmond and the Village in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illi-
nois. Petitioner claimed that Redmond had deprived Allen
of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983 because her use of
deadly force violated the Fourth Amendment, and that
Redmond was also liable under a state wrongful death
statute for having caused Allen's death.. J.A. 8-12.
When Redmond was deposed, petitioner asked her ques-
tions concerning the substance of her communications
with Beyer. Redmond asserted privilege and refused to
respond. Petitioner subsequently subpoenaed Beyer to
testify at a deposition. Pet. App. 6. The district court
refused to quash the subpoena, based on the court's belief

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

4

that any psychotherapist-patient privilege that would be
applicable would extend only to psychiatrists and psychol-
ogists and would not extend to Beyer, who was a social
worker. Pet. App. 7 & n.5. Throughout discovery and at
trial, Beyer and Redmond continued to attempt to protect
the confidentiality of communications between them, see
Pet. App. 8-9, though Beyer ultimately gave limited
testimony concerning Redmond's "factual description of
the events leading up to the shooting." Pet. App. 9; see
J.A. 112-122. Beyer also testified about the timing, du-
ration, and number of her meetings with Redmond. J.A.
112-113. Aside from three redacted pages, Beyer never
produced her notes and never testified concerning
Redmond's disclosures concerning her thoughts and
intentions. Pet. App. 8. Redmond testified about the tim-
ing, duration, and number of her meetings with Beyer, J.A.
100-101. In response to questions regarding what she had
told Beyer, she consistently responded, "I can't recall."
J.A. 102-107.
The trial court instructed the jury that there was no
legal justification for Beyer to refuse to turn over her
notes, and that the jury was therefore "entitled to
presume that the contents of the notes would be unfavor-
able to [respondents]." Pet. App. 9 & n.9. The jury
returned a verdict in favor of petitioner for $45,000 for the
Section 1983 claim and $500,000 for the state wrongful
death claim. Pet. App. 11.
3. Respondents raised two issues on appeal. First,
they argued that the instructions concerning deadly force
were incorrect. The court of appeals rejected that argu-
ment (Pet. App. 12-14), and it is no longer of relevance in
this case.
Respondents also argued that the district court's
instructions incorrectly informed the jury that there was
no privilege applicable, and that the instructions improp-

erly stated that the jury could draw an adverse inference
from respondents' failure to disclose information regard-
ing Redmond's disclosures to Beyer during psychother-
apy. The court of appeals held that there was a psycho-
therapist-patient privilege and that it was applicable to
Beyer as a licensed clinical social worker. Accordingly,
the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new
trial. Pet. App. 15-23.
The court of appeals noted that, under Fed. R. Evid. 501,
"the privilege of a witness * * * shall be governed by the
principles of the common law as they may be interpreted
by the courts of the United States in the light of reason
and experience." The court stated that in its view the
need for a psychotherapist-patient privilege had increased
in recent years, because of increasing crime and violence
that puts stress on witnesses, bystanders, and police offi-
cers. Pet. App. 17-18. The court also stated that "[r]eason
tells us that psychotherapists and patients share a unique
relationship, in which the patient's ability to communicate
freely without the fear of public disclosure is the key to
successful treatment." Pet. App. 18, The court noted that
"communications with a psychotherapist often involve
highly personal matters, the disclosure of which would
frequently be embarrassing to the point of mortification
for the patient." Pet. App. 19 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Finally, the court noted that "all fifty states
have recognized the need for and have adopted varying
forms of the psychotherapist-patient privilege." Pet. App.
20. Based on those facts, the court found that recognition
of a privilege under Rule 501 was warranted.
With respect to the scope of the privilege, the court held
that it "will determine the appropriate scope of the
privilege by balancing the interests protected by shielding
the evidence sought with those advanced by disclosure."
Pet. App. 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). The

court "decline[d] to speculate as to what situations would
call for the abrogation of this privilege," finding that in "a
factual situation [like this case] * * * the balance of the
competing interests tips sharply in favor of the privilege if
we hope to encourage law enforcement officers who are
frequently forced to experience traumatic events by the
very nature of their work to seek qualified professional
help." Ibid.
Finally, the court held that the scope of the privilege
should include not only psychiatrists and psychologists,
but "other mental health care providers as well, including
licensed clinical social workers." Pet. App. 22 n.19 (italics
omitted). Noting that "social workers have been charac-
terized as the `poor person's psychiatrist,'" the court
found that distinguishing practitioners like petitioner
Redmond's psychotherapist, who was fully licensed under
state law, from professionals with other job titles "serves
no discernible public purpose." Pet. App. 23 n.19.

     SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Federal Rule of Evidence 501 instructs courts that the
claim of privilege of a witness "shall be governed by the
principles of the common law as they may be interpreted
* * * in the light of reason and experience." AS the
decisions of this Court and the legislative history of the
Rule confirm, that language does not "freeze" the law of
privileges as of a particular date or disable the federal
courts from recognizing a privilege that was not his-
torically accepted at common law. Since recognition of a
privilege potentially results in the unavailability of rele-
vant and probative evidence, however, the proponent of the
privilege must shoulder a heavy burden of showing that
the social benefits of recognizing the privilege outweigh
the potential injury to the judicial fact-finding function.

Recognition of a psychotherapist-patient privilege is
justified under that standard.  The difficult task of
weighing the costs and benefits of the privilege is eased in
this case by the unanimous judgment of the States that
some form of psychotherapist-patient privilege is justified.
The States would be unlikely to have reached that judg-
ment if doing so would have imposed an unduly high cost
on their judicial systems or failed to promise substantial
social benefits.  The judgment of the States that the
privilege is justified provides a useful measure of the
"reason and experience" in the light of which Rule 501
must be applied.
The judgment of the States is confirmed by an analysis
of the costs and benefits of recognizing this privilege.
Most confidential communications in the psychother-
apeutic setting are unlikely to have any relevance in
litigation. The test of the privilege comes when, as in this
case, an incident produces both litigation and emotional
and mental stress on the participants. In such cases, the
absence of a privilege may lead the individuals involved to
refuse psychotherapeutic treatment or to be unduly guard-
ed in their statements during such treatment. Thus,
failing to recognize the privilege would not often lead to
the availability of significant new evidence, but would
impose a difficult choice on those who need psychother-
apeutic treatment.  The burden would be particularly
heavy on law enforcement officers, who are likely to suffer
the emotional after-effects of traumatic incidents and who
are also subject to being named as defendants in litigation
resulting from such incidents.
None of the accepted exceptions or limitations to the
privilege would appear to apply to the facts of this case. As
the court of appeals noted, Officer Redmond was careful to
preserve the privilege and did not divulge the contents of
her communications to her psychotherapist throughout

discovery and trial proceedings. Petitioner argues that
the fact that Officer Redmond's psychotherapist was a
clinical social worker-rather than a psychiatrist or psy-
chologist-is fatal to the claim of privilege. The basis of
the privilege is society's interest in the availability and
benefits of psychotherapeutic treatment, however, not the
particular school of treatment or discipline in which the
therapist is licensed or otherwise qualified. Where, as
here, state law recognizes clinical social workers as
appropriate providers of psychotherapy and grants them a
privilege commensurate with that of psychologists or
psychiatrists, those who receive care from a clinical social
worker in that State have a reasonable expectation that
their communications will be confidential.  Accordingly,
the psychotherapist-patient privilege should apply.


        ARGUMENT

CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY A PA-
TIENT TO A PSYCHOTHERAPIST IN THE COURSE OF
AND IN FURTHERANCE OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC
TREATMENT ARE PRIVILEGED UNDER FEDERAL RULE
OF EVIDENCE 501

A. Under Rule 501, The Federal Courts Have The
   Authority To Recognize A Privilege Not Histor-
   ically Recognized By The Common Law

Under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, "the
privilege of a witness shall be governed by the principles of
the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts
of the United States in the light of reason and exper-
ience." The general nature of the inquiry required by the
Rule is reasonably clear:  The historical common law
privileges are generally to be recognized by the federal
courts, although they should be re-examined where the
rationale supporting them has become questionable. With

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

respect to privileges not accorded historical recognition
under the common law, Rule 501 grants federal courts
authority to accord them recognition if they satisfy the
requirements of that Rule.
1. The federal courts are deeply committed to the
principle that "the public * * * has a right to every man's
evidence." United States v. Bryan, 339 U.S. 323,331 (1950).
Exceptions to broad principles of admissibility of relevant
evidence "are in derogation of the search for truth."
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 710 (1974). Privil-
eges are therefore "not lightly created nor expansively
construed." Ibid. A privilege may be "accepted `only to
the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify
or excluding relevant evidence has a public good tran-
scending the normally predominant principle of utilizing
all rational means for ascertaining truth.'" Trammel v.
United States, 445 U.S. 40, 50 (1980) (quoting Elkins v.
United States, 364 U.S. 206,234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting)).
Where an accepted common law privilege, such as the
attorney-client,1 marital,2 or priest-penitent privilege,3 is
involved, a federal court need not re-examine in each case
whether the privilege is generally justified. Even with
respect to such privileges, however, Rule 501 does not
"freeze" the law of privilege. As demonstrated by this

Court's decision in Trammel limiting the privilege for
adverse spousal testimony, there are cases in which
`(reason and experience" require re-examination of the
scope or incidents of even an historically excepted common
law privilege.
Just as Rule 501 may on occasion require a re-
evaluation of an historical common law privilege, so the
Rule also may require recognition of a privilege not
historically accepted by the common law. As this Court
observed in Trammel, the language of Rule 501 "acknowl-
edge[s] the authority of the federal courts to continue the
evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in
federal criminal trials," and "manifest[s] an affirmative
intention not to freeze the law of privilege." 445 U.S. at
47.
2. The history of the Federal Rules of Evidence
confirms that Rule 501 was not intended to preclude
recognition of a privilege not historically recognized at
common law. As originally formulated by the Advisory
Committee and transmitted to Congress by this Court, the
Federal Rules of Evidence provided that federal courts
would recognize nine specific privileges (including a
psychotherapist-patient privilege, see Rules of Evidence
for United States Courts and Magistrates (Proposed
Rules), 56 F.R.D. 183,240-241 (1972) (Proposed Rule 504),
plus whatever others were "required by the Constitution
* * * or provided by Act of Congress." Proposed Rule
501, 56 F.R.D. at 230. Congress rejected that codification
of the law of privilege, instead enacting Rule 501 as it
currently stands. Congress did not, however, thereby
intend to disapprove or foreclose the recognition of the
specific privileges included in the proposed rules.
Congress's substitution of Rule 501 for the proposal
transmitted by this Court was necessary, not because the
proposed rules were too broad, but because they were too

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

11

controversial for Congress to evaluate without unduly
delaying the entire Rules project. As the Senate Com-
mittee stated, "it was clear that no agreement was likely
to be possible as to the content of specific privilege rules,
and * * * the inability to agree threatened to forestall or
prevent passage of an entire rules package." S. Rep. No.
1277, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1974). See also 120 Cong. Rec.
40,891 (1974) (stating that "the privilege section of the
rules of evidence generated more comment or controversy
than any other section"). To permit prompt enactment of
the Federal Rules of Evidence, Congress therefore decided
to "leav[e] the law in its current condition," while ex-
pressly stating that the law should be " developed" by the
federal courts using "the principles''-but not necessarily
the precise privileges-"of the common law." S. Rep. No.
1277, supra, at 6 (emphasis added).
Far from expressing an intent to freeze the common law
of privilege, the Committee specifically expressed its
agreement with the principle that privileges not histor-
ically recognized at common law could be recognized
where they satisfied "the principles of the common law as
* * * interpreted * * * in the light of reason and
experience." Indeed, referring specifically to the psycho-
therapist-patient privilege, the Committee explained:

The committee has received a considerable volume
of correspondence from psychiatric organizations and
psychiatrists concerning the deletion of rule 504
[regarding the psychotherapist privilege] of the rule
submitted by the Supreme Court. It should be clearly
understood that, in approving this general rule as to
privileges, the action of Congress should not be
understood as disapproving any recognition of a
psychiatrist-patient, or husband-wife, or any other of
the enumerated privileges contained in the Supreme

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

12

Court rules. Rather, our action should be understood
as reflecting the view that the recognition of a
privilege based on a confidential relationship and other
privileges should be determined on a case-by-case
basis.

S. Rep. No. 1277, supra, at 13 (emphasis added)." See also
120 Cong. Rec. 40,891 0974) ("Rule 501 is not intended to
freeze the law of privilege as it now exists.").
3.  As this Court stated in University of Pennsylvania
v. EEOC, 493 U.S. 182 (1990), "although Rule 501 mani-
fests a congressional desire not to freeze the law of
privilege but rather to provide the courts with flexibility
to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case basis," that
flexible authority should not be exercised "expansively."
Id. at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 176 (1979) (evidentiary
privileges "disfavored"). Instead, a court called upon to
recognize a privilege that was not historically recognized
at common law may not recognize the claimed privilege
unless its proponent can demonstrate that it satisfies the
principles that have controlled the common law develop-
ment of privilege, as interpreted in the light of "reason"
and of the "experience" that can be gleaned from modern
social and legal developments.

  B. A Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege Deserves
   Recognition Under The Principles By Which The
   Common Law Has Historically Recognized
   Privileges

An assertion under Rule 501 of a privilege for
confidential communications not historically recognized
at common law can be guided by two inquiries.  First,
unanimous or near-unanimous recognition of a privilege
by state law supports recognition of the privilege under
Rule 501, especially where the States have the primary

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

13

interest in regulating the relationship in which the
confidential communications take place. Second, a priv-
ilege should not be recognized under Rule 501 unless. the
proponent of the privilege demonstrates that the benefits
of the privilege outweigh its costs to the fact finding
process. The results of both inquiries suggest that a
psychotherapist-patient privilege should be recognized.
1. State Law. Where a privilege is claimed for con-
fidential communications that take place within a rela-
tionship that is primarily governed by state law, the
degree of recognition of that privilege by the States
provides a useful point of departure for the analysis. For
example, in Trammel, the Court reversed its historical
understanding of the privilege for adverse spousal testi-
mony, holding that a defendant may not preclude swilling
spouse from testifying against the defendant at a criminal
trial. After stating the general principles governing the
analysis, the first factor the Court turned to was that
"support for the privilege against adverse spousal testi-
mony has been eroded," citing the fact that the number of
States recognizing the privilege had declined over the
years. 445 U.S. at 48 (citing state statutes). See also
United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 569-570 (1989)
(referring to trends in state law in deciding issue under
Rule 501); United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360,368 (1980)
(recognizing importance of state law in this area); In re
Doe, 964 F.2d 1325, 1328 (2d Cir. 1992); cf. Branzburg v.
Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 686, 689 (1972) (pre-Rule 501 case
concerning claim of First Amendment reporter's privil-
ege). The experience of the States can be important under
Rule 501 for a number of reasons.
One element of the analysis under Rule 501 requires
inquiry into the cost imposed by the privilege on the
"normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational
means for ascertaining truth.)" Trammel v. United States,

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

14

445 U.S. at 50. States can generally be expected zealously
to protect the fact-finding function of their courts.
Accordingly, if the States have unanimously or over-
whelmingly recognized a privilege, it suggests that such
recognition does not. unduly impair the judicial fact-
finding function. With respect to the potential injury to
the fact-finding process, the States' recognition of a
privilege provides a useful measure of the "experience"
that federal courts must consult in interpreting the
"principles of the common law" under Rule 501.
State law is also of relevance in assessing the public
interest that would be served by recognizing the privilege.
The rationale for recognizing a privilege for confidential
communications is not ordinarily to improve the func-
tioning of the litigation process, but rather to achieve a
non-litigation goal by supporting a confidential relation-
ship in which society has a strong interest. Cf. Trammel,
445 U.S. at 51 (discussing rationales. for several Privil-
eges); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974)
(executive privilege); Wolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7,
14 (1934) (marital privilege); Stein v. Bowman, 38 U.S. (13
Pet.) 209, 223 (1839) (same). Where the States have
primary regulatory authority over the relationship in
question and have generally concluded that a privilege
arising out of that relationship will achieve a social good,
that judgment is entitled to respect. Conversely, if federal
courts refuse to recognize a privilege so widely recognized
by the States, the public interest sought to be furthered by
the States-not the litigation interests of the federal
courts-would be threatened. In short, the States' judg-
ments in this area deserve careful attention. 4

In this case, state law cuts decisively in favor of
recognition of a privilege. As the court of appeals noted,
all 50 States and the District of Columbia have adopted
some form of psychotherapist-patient privilege. Pet. App.
20 & n.17. See also Pet. Br. 31 ("every state and the
District of Columbia appear to have adopted some protec-
tion for confidential communications with a psychiatrist
or a clinical psychologist").
Petitioner contends that the experience of the States in
this area is less compelling than it might seem because
state laws vary with respect to the nature of protection
the privilege accords and the exceptions that are recog-
nized.  Pet. 31-38.  No non-constitutional privilege is
without exceptions or qualifications, and the details of the
laws of 50 States and the District of Columbia exhibit
substantial variance.  There is nonetheless substantial
uniformity among the States concerning the general con-
tours of the exceptions applicable to the psychotherapist-
patient privilege.
One class of standard exceptions is based on the need for
the testimony of psychotherapists where such testimony
must substitute for the testimony of the patient or others
who may be unable to protect their own rights. Thus, the

___________________(footnotes)

a privilege from the proposed rules, standing alone, does not compel the
conclusion that it should not be recognized. But such an omission "does
suggest that the claimed privilege was not thought to be either indel-
ibly ensconced in our common law or an imperative of federalism."
United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 368 (1980). See also United
States v. McPartlin,595F.2d 1321, 1336-1337 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,
444 U.S. 833 (1979); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 434 F. Supp. 648, 650
n.1 (E.D. Mich. 1977), aff'd,570 F.2d 562 (6th Cir. 1978). The fact that
the proposed rules included a psychotherapist-patient privilege, on the
other hand, supports the conclusion that such a privilege was not
inconsistent with the "principles of the common law."

States almost universally provide exceptions for cases
involving abuse of children, incompetents, or disabled
persons, and for proceeding involving hospitalization of
the patient.5 Another standard exception is essentially a
codification of waiver principles; it prohibits assertion of

large number of State statutes and evidence codes, how-

previous paragraph. The unanimity among the States on
the basic principle that some form of psychotherapist-

substantial uniformity among a large number of States on
the major exceptions that are applicable, provides strong
support for the argument that "reason and experience"
support recognition of a psychotherapist-patient privilege.

question under Rule 501 is whether the proponent of the
privilege can establish that the values served by its
recognition outweigh the harm that the litigation process
will suffer through the unavailability of otherwise

probative evidence. In an influential formulation, Dean
Wigmore stated that requirement as follows:

  (1) The communications must originate in a confi-
  dence that they will not be disclosed.

  (b) This element of confidentiality must be essen-
  tial to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the
  relationship between the parties.

  (c) The relationship must be one that in the opinion
  of the community ought to be sedulously fostered.

  (d) The injury that would inure to the relationship
  by the disclosure must be greater than the benefit
  thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.

8 J. Wigmore, Evidence 32285, at 527 (McNaughton rev.
1961).
(i). There is little doubt that the first Wigmore criterion
is satisfied here: communications made in the course of
and in furtherance of psychotherapy "originate in a
confidence that they will not be disclosed."  Empirical
evidence strongly suggests that patients believe that what
they tell their psychotherapists will be held in the
strictest confidence, and the unanimous adoption by the
States of a psychotherapist-patient privilege demonstrates
that that belief is reasonable.11 As the Advisory Com-
mittee that drafted Proposed Rule 504 commented:

Among physicians, the psychiatrist has a special need
to maintain confidentiality. His capacity to help his
patients is completely dependent upon their willing-
                  . .
11 See, e.g., Appelbaum, Kapen, Waiters, Lidz, & Roth, Confiden-
tiality: An Empirical Test of the Utilitarian Perspective, 12 Bull. of the
Amer. Acad. of Psychiatry and the Law 109, 110 (1984) (reviewing prim
studies).

ness and ability to talk freely. This makes it difficult
if not impossible for him to function without being
able to assure his patients of confidentiality and,
indeed, privileged communication. Where there may
be exceptions to this general rule * * * , there is
wide agreement that confidentiality is a sine qua non
for successful psychiatric treatment. The relation-
ship may well be likened to that of the priest-penitent
or the lawyer-client.

56 F.R.D. 183,242 (1972).
(ii). The psychotherapist-patient privilege also satisfies
Wigmore's second requirement-that such confidentiality
generally is "essential * * * to the full and satisfactory"
pursuit of the therapy. Unlike the treatment of physical
illnesses and conditions, where chemical or other tests
and procedures may be sufficient both to diagnose an
illness and treat it, the practice of psychotherapy relies
heavily on disclosures of information by the patient for
both diagnosis and treatment.12 Moreover, given the
nature of the mental and emotional conditions that psycho-
therapists treat, "[disclosure of communications to psy-
chotherapists * * * would frequently be embarrassing to
the point of mortification for the patient." In re Doe, 964
F.2d at 1328; see also In re Zuniga, 714 F.2d 632, 639-640
(6th Cir.) ("The essential element of the psychotherapist-

12 AS the Sixth Circuit has observed, "[m]any physical ailments
might be treated with some degree of effectiveness by a doctor whom
the patient did not trust, but a psychiatrist must have his patient's
confidence or he cannot help him." In re Zuniga, 714 F.2d 632, 638 (6th
Cir.) (quoting Taylor v. United States, 222 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C. Cir.

F.R.D. 565, 571 (E.D.N.Y. 1977) ("Essential to psychotherapy are
confidential personal revelations about matters which the patient is
normally reluctant to discuss."); see also In re Doe, 964 F.2d 1325 at

patient privilege is its assurance to the patient that his
innermost thoughts may be revealed without fear of
disclosure."), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 983(1983]. Finally, a
psychotherapeutic patient may often feel less urgency
regarding the need to obtain therapy than many patients
who are injured or physically ill.  Uncertainty about
whether disclosures will remain confidential may there-
fore have a substantive effect on the willingness of indi-
viduals to seek psychotherapeutic treatment and to be
completely candid in the course of that treatment, In re
Zuniga, 714 F.2d at 638. The importance of confidentiality
to the psychotherapist-patient relationship is comparable
to its importance to the priest-penitent or attorney-client
relationship, both of which benefit from privileges under
Rule 501.
(iii). Petitioner does not dispute that the third Wigmore
criterion-whether the psychotherapist-patient relation-
ship is one "that in the opinion of the community ought to
be sedulously fostered''-is satisfied. Society has an enor-
mous interest in the relief of mental and emotional dis-
tress and il1ness, and psychotherapy is an accepted means
to that end in many situations.
(iv). That leaves the fourth, and most significant,
criterion-whether the "injury that would inure to the
relationship by the disclosure" is "greater than the
benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litiga-
tion." The uniform view of the States that a psychother-
apist-patient privilege merits recognition should carry
significant weight in making the judgment that this
criterion is satisfied-  There are, however, additional
considerations that also support this conclusion.
The true costs and benefits of recognizing the privilege
become apparent in cases like this one, where a traumatic
incident or event imposes mental and emotional stresses
on a participant and also may reasonably be expected to

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

 23

lead to litigation. In that context, the failure to recognize
a privilege can exact a heavy cost, because participants
may often be discouraged from seeking psychotherapeutic
treatment because of the absence of a privilege. In such
instances, the failure to recognize the privilege would not
materially assist the fact-finding function of the courts,
since the very evidence that is sought-the patient's
confidential communications to the psychotherapist in
furtherance of the therapeutic relationship-would be lost
if the confidential relationship is not formed in the first
place.
A useful illustration is provided by law enforcement
agents, such as Officer Redmond, who become" involved in
incidents such as the shooting in this case. Agents
involved in such incidents frequently experience emot-
ional and psychological stress and turmoil.13 The diffi-
culties can become severe enough to affect their ability to
function effectively, both in their private lives and on the
job. 14 Psychotherapeutic treatment and counseling can be
helpful to agents in that situation.

13 Among the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder are
reexperiencing of the traumatic incident and intense psychological
distress when the individual is exposed to events that recall the trau-
matic incident; amnesia; feelings of estrangement and detachment;
difficulty sleeping and recurrent nightmares; irritability outbursts of
anger; difficulty concentrating or completing tasks; and self-destructive
and impulsive behavior. See American Psychiatric Ass'n, Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) 424-429.
Those symptoms are frequently encountered bylaw enforcement agents
involved in traumatic incidents. See generally Federal Bureau of
Investigation, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Critical Incidents in Policing
(Critical Incidents) 85-94, 144-146, 161-162, 251-253, 269-273 (rev. 1991)
(describing symptoms in police officers); see also id. at 359-362.
14 Studies from the 1970's showed that up to 95% of the police officers
involved in shooting incidents had left police work within five years.
See Michael J. McMains, The Management and Treatment of Post-

Traumatic incidents may also l-cad to litigation. Agents
involved in such incidents thus often reasonably anticipate
being named as defendants in subsequent Bivens, Section
1983, or tort actions.  If the agents become aware that
statements they make to a psychotherapist in the course
of treatment would be discoverable in litigation and
perhaps admissible in court, they may be dissuaded from
seeking such treatment altogether. 15 And if they do obtain
such treatment, their statements to their psychother-
apists may be sufficiently self-censored to render suc-
cessful treatment difficult or impossible.
Law enforcement agencies frequently play an important
role in referring agents involved in traumatic incidents to
counseling. Most of the federal law enforcement agencies,
for example, have employee assistance programs through
which, inter alia, they identify agents who have suffered
emotional or psychological difficulties as a result of
traumatic incidents and who would be likely to benefit

that that number can be dramatically reduced, with appropriate agency
support that includes, where appropriate, psychotherapeutic counseling.

from psychotherapeutic treatment or counseling. 16 Some
agencies mandate referral to a psychotherapist after a
traumatic incident. If no privilege is recognized, the agen-
cies may feel themselves obligated to inform agents that,
although psychotherapy is encouraged or required, dis-
closures to the therapist will be made at the risk of
discovery and evidentiary use in ensuing litigation. Even
if agencies do not bring that information to the attention
of their agents, a single highly publicized case would be
likely to have the same effect. Agents, fearing subsequent
litigation, might consequently be unwilling to undertake
psychotherapy where indicated or, if they did enter
psychotherapy, to communicate with their therapists with
sufficient candor to obtain the benefits of the therapy.
Essentially the same calculus would appear to apply in a
variety of other situations outside the law enforcement
context, in which a particular, traumatic incident results
not only in the likelihood of litigation, but also in stresses
on the participants that indicate a need for psycho-
therapeutic treatment. In situations like those, the ab-
sence of a privilege would impose a substantial cost on the
participants and on society, while making very little new
evidence available in subsequent litigation.

  C. The Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege Extends To
   The Facts Of This Case

1. With a single exception, this case presents a core
application of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Re-
spondents seek to discover and to introduce in evidence
              
___________________(footnotes)

16 Among the federal law enforcement agencies that have active
employee assistance programs that make voluntary or mandatory
referrals to psychotherapists are the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Natural-
ization Service, the Secret Service, the Customs Service, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Internal Revenue Service.

statements that Officer Redmond made to her psycho-
therapist in the course of psychotherapeutic treatment.
None of the common exceptions to the privilege appear to
apply.17
Accordingly, as the court of appeals noted, this case
does not require the court to "speculate as to what situ-
ations would call for the abrogation of this privilege." Pet.
App. 22. When such situations do arise, the contours of the
privilege and its exceptions should be worked out through
relatively clear categorical rules, with a "fail-safe" excep-
tion for other extraordinary circumstances justifying
abrogation of the privilege. As this Court explained in
Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383,393 (1981) with
respect to the attorney-client privilege, "[a]n uncertain
privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results
in widely varying applications by the courts, is little
better than no privilege at all." The result of a privilege of
uncertain scope would be to "place the policy of protecting
open and legitimate disclosure between [psychotherapists]
and [patients] at undue risk." United States v. Zolin, 491
U.S. at 571. The solid basis in reason and experience
provided by the States' experience with the privilege and
its exceptions can be very useful in developing appro-
priately clear categorical exceptions and limitations.
2. The single respect in which this case is not a core
application of the privilege is that Officer Redmond sought
psychotherapeutic treatment from a clinical social wor-

___________________(footnotes)

17 Like all other privileges, the psychotherapist-patient privilege
would be subject to waiver principles. See United States v. Premises
Known As 281 Syosset Woodbury Road, 1995 WL 737466, at *5 (2d Cir.
1995). In this case, Officer Redmond took steps to protect her privilege.
Although she testified concerning the duration and timing of the
therapy, see J.A. 100-101, the court of appeals correctly noted "that the
psychotherapist/patient  privilege  protects  only  confidential
communications ." Pet. App. 21 n.18.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

27

ker, not a psychiatrist or psychologist. See Pet. Br. 39-40..
The basis of the privilege however, is society's interest in
the availability and benefits of psychotherapeutic treat-
ment, not the particular school of treatment in which the
psychotherapist is licensed or otherwise qualified. Some
studies have shown that clinical social workers perform a
very large percentage of the psychotherapeutic treatment
that takes place in this country, and that their work is
concentrated in rural areas and among those who are
unlikely to be able to afford the services of psychiatrists
or psychologists.18  Limiting the privilege to those
licensed as psychologists or psychiatrists would impose am
unjustified and unnecessary burden on those least able to
afford it.19
That does not mean that confidential communications in
the course Of psychotherapeutic treatment by a clinical
social worker -or any other person claiming to administer
psychotherapy-would in every instance qualify for the
privilege. The privilege should not be applied in contexts
in which its rationale fails. The key question is whether
the professional was performing genuine psychotherapy at
the time of the communication, and whether the communi-
cations at issue were reasonably believed by all partici-
pants to be confidential.

therapist-Patient Privilege to Patients of Psychiatric Social Workers, 61
Calif. L. Rev. 1050,1050 (1973).
19 As argued above, the availability of a privilege may affect
individuals' willingness to seek psychotherapy in at least some types of
cases.  There is a danger that recognition of certain professional
categories and not others would serve to give an unjustified competi-
tive advantage to professionals in the favored categories.

In Illinois, social workers are licensed to provide "men-
tal health services for the evaluation, treatment, and
prevention of mental and emotional disorders," see Pet.
App. 5 n.3, and state law clearly extends the psycho-
therapist-patient privilege to treatment by clinical social
workers, see Pet. App. 21. In those circumstances, Officer
Redmond and her clinical social worker reasonably be-
lieved that Redmond's communications would be confi-
dential, and there is a basis for recognizing the privilege.
In places where state law does not accord that recognition
to clinical social workers or render psychotherapeutic
communications with a social worker privileged, there
would be less basis to conclude that the patient had a
reasonable expectation that the patient's confidences
would be protected. In a case arising in such a State, there
may therefore be no basis to claim a federal court priv-
ilege; there would be little reason for a federal court to
attempt to protect the confidentiality of a relationship that
the State itself has not attempted to protect. Cf. In re
Grand Jury Subpoena., 886 F.2d 135 (6th Cir. 1989).
