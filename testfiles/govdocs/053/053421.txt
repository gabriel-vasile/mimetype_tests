STATEMENT

Following a jury trial in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Louisiana, pe-
titioner was convicted of first degree murder of
Jadasha D. Lowery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

Act, 18 U.S.C.  13, 7, and 2.  Petitioner was sentenced

to life imprisonment.  1.  The court of appeals affirmed
the conviction and sentence.  J.A. 64-92.

1.  Statutuory Background

a.  Congress exercises legislative jurisdiction over
federal enclaves pursuant to Article I, 8, Cl. 17, and
Article IV, 3, Cl. 2, of the Constitution. See United
States v. Sharpnack, 355 U.S.  286, 288  (1958).  The
first Federal Crimes Act provided for the punish
ment of certain serious offenses, Such as murder,
manslaughter, maiming, and larceny, if committed
"within any fort, arsenal, dock-yard, magazine, or in
any other place or district of country, under the sole
and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States."  Act,
of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, 3, 1 Stat. 113; see also 7, 13,
16, 1 Stat. 113-116.  Persons committing other crimes
in the federal enclaves went unpunished, however,
since the States lacked jurisdiction over these areas,
and the federal courts lacked common law jurisdic-
tion. See William v.  United States, 327 U.S. 711,
720-721  n.19 (1946); United  States  v.  Press  Publishing
Co., 219 U.S.  1, 12 (1911); Jurisdiction  over Federal
Areas Wit h in the United States, Report of the
Interdepartmental Committee for the Study of .Ju -
risdiction over Federal Areas within  the States, Pt.
II, at 124-126 (1957).

Congress subsequently enacted the Federal
Crimes Act of March 3, 1825, ch. 65, 4 Stat. 115,  which
expanded the list of enumerated federal crimes.  For
areas subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction, Sec-
tion 3 of the 1825 Act supplemented the enumerated

gree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  His petition 
for a writ of certiorari, docketed as No. 98-7726 is currently
pending.

crimes by adopting as federal criminal law the crimi-
nal laws of the State within which the federal enclave
was located.  Ibid.; see Williams, 327 U.S.  at 720-721
& n.19; Press Publishing, 219 U.S.  at 10-13.  Section
3 of the 1825 Act, which became the basis of the
present Assimilative Crimes Act, provided:

* * * if any offence shall be committed in any
[federal enclave], the punishment of which offence
is not specially provided for by any law of the
United States, such offence shall, upon a con-
viction in any court of the United States having
cognizance thereof, be liable to, and receive the
same punishment as the laws of the state in
which such fort, dock-yard, navy-yard, arsenal,
armory, or magazine, or other place, ceded as
aforesaid, is situated, provide for the like offence
when committed within the body of any county of
such state.

4 Stat. 115.  2.
Congressman  (later President)  James Buchanan
explained the need for that provision by observing
that  "a great variety of actions, to which a high
degree of moral guilt is attached, and which are
punished as crimes at the common law, and by every
State in the Union, maybe committed with impunity
on the high seas, and in any place where Congress has
exclusive jurisdiction."  Williams, 327 U.S.  at 720-721
n.19  (quoting 40 Annals of Congress, 17th Cong., 2d
Sess. 929  (1822-1823)).  In acting to redress that

___________________(footnotes)

2  The Act covered offenses committed in  "any fort, dock-
yard, navy-yard, arsenal, armory, or magazine, the site
whereof is ceded to, and under the jurisdiction of, the United
States, or on the site of any lighthouse, or other needful build-
ing belonging to the United States."  4 Stat. 115.

situation,  "Congress expressly adopted the fundamen-
tal policy of conformity to local law"  and  "made it
clear that, with the exception of the enlarged list of
offenses specifically proscribed by it, the federal
offenses in each enclave were to be identified with
those proscribed by the State in which the enclave
was situated."  Sharpnack, 355 U.S.  at 290.  See also
Franklin v.  United States, 216 U.S.  559, 568 (1910).
In  United States v.  Paul, 31 U.S.  (6 Pet.)  141, 142
(1832), this Court construed the 1825 Act as "limited
to the laws of the several states in force at the time of
its enactment."  Because the ACA  (so construed did
not authorize the application to federal enclaves of
state Paws enacted after 1825,  "the Act gradually lost
much of its effectiveness in maintaining current
conformity with state criminal Laws."  Sharpnack,
355 U.S.  at 291.  Congress therefore undertook peri-
odic reenactments. of the Assimilative Crimes Act to
adopt the state laws in effect at the time of each
reenactment.  See Act of April 5, 1866, ch. 24, 2, 14
Stat. 13; Act of July 7, 1898, ch. 576, 2, 30 Stat.  717;
Act of March 4, 1909, ch. 321, 289,35 Stat. 1145; Act
of June 15, 1933, ch. 85, 48 Stat. 152; Act of June 20,
1935, ch. 284,49 Stat. 394; Act of June 6, 1940, ch. 241,
54 Stat. 234.  See generally Johnson v.  Yellow Cab
Transit Co., 321 U.S.  383, 398-399  (1944)  [Frankfurter,
J., dissenting); Franklin, 216 U.S. at 570.  3.

3  In addition, the use of the term  "offense"  was abandoned
when Congress codified the federal criminal laws in 1909.  As
amended in 1909, the ACA applied to any person  "who shall do
or omit the doing of any act or thing which is not made penal
by any laws of Congress, but which" would be  "penal"  u rider
state law.  35 Stat. 1145.  The House Report stated that  "[a]n act
which is not forbidden by law and to the commission of which
no penalty is attached in no legal sense can be denominated an

In 1948, Congress amended the ACA to make the
Act applicable to offenses committed in federal en-
claves under the state laws in force at the time of the
alleged offense. Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 1, 13, 62
Stat. 686. The current Act thus dispenses with the
requirement for further periodic reenactment of the
ACA in order to stay current with changing state
criminal law. In Sharpnack, this Court upheld the
1948 ACA against constitutional challenge, rejecting
the contention that assimilation of state laws enacted
after the passage of the 1948 Act represented an
improper delegation of federal authority to state
officials. The Court explained that "[r]ather than
being a delegation by Congress of its legislative
authority to the States, it is a deliberate continuing
adoption by Congress for federal enclaves of such
unpre-empted offenses and punishments as shall have
been already put in effect by the respective States for
their own government."  355 U.S.  at 294.
In its current form, the ACA applies within the
"special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the
United States,"  as defined by 18 U.S.C.  7.  That area
includes, inter alia,  "[a]ny lands reserved or acquired

omission which, although not made punishable by any
enactment of Congress, would be punishable if com-

b.  The federal murder statute provides that
"[m]urder is the unlawful killing of a human being
with malice aforethought.."  18 U.S.C.  111l(a).  The
statute identifies several categories of first degree
murder and provides that  "[a]ny other murder is murd-
er in the second degree."  Ibid. Like the Assimila-
tive Crimes Act, the federal murder statute applies
"[w]ithin the special maritime and territorial juris-
diction of the United States: 18 U.S.C.  1111(b).  Per-
sons convicted of frost degree murder  "shall be pun-
ished by death or by imprisonment for life."  Ibid.
Persons convicted of second degree murder  "shall be
imprisoned for any term of years or for life."  Ibid.
c.  Louisiana law establishes a variety of catego-
ries of first degree murder. The applicable statute
provides, inter alia, that a homicide is first degree
murder  "[w]hen the offender has the specific intent to
kill or to inflict great bodily harm upon a victim under
the age of twelve years."  La. Rev. Stat. Ann.
 14:30A(5).  That provision was added to the Louisi-
ana criminal code in 1985.  See 1985 La. Acts, No. 515,

sentence of life imprisonment if the government does
not seek the death penalty.  La. Rev. Stat.  Ann.
14:30C.

2.  The present proceeding
a.  Jadasha Lowery was the four-year-old daughter
of James Lewis.  Petitioner was her stepmother.  Her
death occurred in the family's home at Fort Polk, a
United States military reservation, where James
Lewis was stationed with the U.S.  Army.  J.A. 65.  It
is undisputed that the place at which Jadasha's death

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

9

occurred is an area within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States.  See J.A. 5-6.
Jadasha was killed at the hands of petitioner and .
James Lewis on December 20, 1993, as the result of
repeated and severe beatings.  The forensic patholo-
gist who examined Jadasha counted more than 200
injuries on her body.  Jadasha received most of those
injuries within 24 hours of her death, although raw
sores, lacerations, and callouses on her body evi-
denced chronic and repetitive injuries.  J.A. 65,83-85.
Petitioner and James Lewis admitted that they had
beaten Jadasha numerous times within the 24-hour
period before her death.  James Lewis shook the little
girl and beat her with his hand or a fly swatter.
Petitioner beat Jadasha with a fly swatter, hit her
across the face with a coat hanger, and also used
switches to whip the child.  Because the three spent
the day of Jadasha's death together, petitioner and
James Lewis were each aware of the beatings admin-
istered by the other, Indeed, once during the day, the
little girl ran into her room following a beating by
James Lewis-only to have petitioner summon her
again for another round of beatings by her father.
J.A. 83.
Investigators at the crime scene found blood
throughout the house.  Blood was present on the floor
of the living room, on the floor in Jadasha's room, on
the sofa, window curtain, closet doors in the hallway,
master bedroom closet, on the walls, on clothing, on
blankets.  Blood was found on pieces of a curtain rod
found crumpled in the Lewises' garbage can.  One
blood spot on the wall looked like a child's smeared
hand print.  J.A. 84.
The pathologist testified that Jadasha had died of a
cerebral edema-a swelling of the brain that ulti-

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------



10

mately causes respiratory functions to cease-caused
by a blow to the head.  He conservatively counted nine
head injuries, any one of which was sufficient to cause
death.  He testified that such a blow was the equiva-
lent of dropping a child on her head from more than
three feet onto an uncarpeted floor.  J.A. 65, 84-85.
Jadasha also suffered massive hemorrhaging, losing
one-to two-thirds of her entire blood volume from her
circulatory system, which was redirected into the
tissues underlying her injuries.  The pathologist tes-
tified that the hemorrhaging could have eventually
caused the girl's death if the head injuries had not
killed her first.  J.A. 85.
Neighbors and friends described a history of child
abuse by petitioner and James Lewis.  One had ob-
served injuries on Jadasha on several occasions, in-
cluding a large black eye and burst lip.  Another
testified that petitioner had withheld food from
Jadasha for three days and had bathed the little girl in
bleach. Others recalled observing signs of injury and
abuse, including  a burn on Jadasha's ear caused by hot
liquid.  A few remembered hearing petitioner state
that  "if she didn't stop whipping Jadasha she would
hurt her or kill her, "  and the  "she was going to let
James whip  [Jadasha because]  [s]he wasn't going to go
to jail for killing that child."  J.A. 85-86.
b.  The indictment in this case charged petitioner
and James Lewis with first degree murder under
Louisiana law pursuant to the ACA.  See J.A. 3-4.  4.

Before trial, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment.  See J.A. 5-7.  She argued that the federal
murder statute, 18 U.S.C.  1111, provides for the spe-
cific crime of first degree murder, and that the as-
similation of the Louisiana murder statute under the
ACA was therefore improper.  See J.A. 6-7.
The district court denied the motion, holding that
petitioner was subject to prosecution under the Lou-
isiana statute.  J.A. 8-18.  The court acknowledged
that  "the acts with which  [petitioner is]  charged
could be punishable under the federal murder
statute."  J.A. 15.  It concluded, however, that peti-
tioner was

being prosecuted in this case under a state stat-
ute designed to punish specific conduct of a differ-
ent character than that proscribed in the federal
murder statute.  The state statute is specifically
designed to provide a deterrent to child abuse, a
subject which is not addressed by federal law.

Ibid.  The court held on that basis that  "the use of the
ACA is proper and  [petitioner's]  motion to dismiss
will be denied."  J.A. 18.
c.  Petitioner and her co-defendant were tried be-
fore a jury on the assimilated state charge of first
degree murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  14:30A(5).
The district court instructed the jury that it could
convict petitioner on that charge only if it found
beyond a reasonable doubt that  (1)  petitioner  "killed
Jadasha Lowery,"  (2)  petitioner  "acted with specific
intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm,"  and  (3)
"[t]he victim was under twelve years of age."  J.A. 31.

The jury found petitioner guilty of that offense.  J.A.
37. 
Following her conviction, petitioner was sentenced
to life imprisonment under the federal Sentencing
Guidelines.  See J.A. 48.  She was assigned a base of-
fense level of 43, pursuant to the Guideline for first
degree murder, 2A1. 1  She was given two additional
points under Guidelines  3A1.1  (vulnerable victim),
for a final offense level of 45.  See J.A. 48-51.  She was
placed in Criminal History Category I.  J.A. 48.  The
resulting Guidelines sentence -was life imprisonment.
Ibid, The district court sentenced petitioner to life
imprisonment.  J.A. 58.
d.  The court of appeals affirmed petitioner's con-
viction and sentence.  J.A. 64-92.
The court of appeals first held that petitioner
should have been charged under the federal murder
statute rather than the Louisiana murder statute and
the Assimilative Crimes Act.  J.A. 66-75.  The court
asserted that the ACA  "fills in gaps existing in
federal statutes regarding criminal law,"  but that
"where Congress has enacted legislation criminaliz
ing conduct on the enclaves, the federal stauus
preempt the state laws regarding those crimes."  J.A.
67.  In the view of the court of appeals, no  "gap"  in
federal law existed because the conduct at issue was
proscribed by 18 U.S.C.  1111. J.A. 71.  The court con-
cluded that  "the federal murder statute preempts the
Louisiana first degree murder statute because the
killing of a human being is punishable under the
federal statute and because the nature of the crime
'murder of does not differ substantially from
the nature and theory of murder in general."  J.A. 75.
The court held, however, that the government's
reliance on the Assimilative Crimes Act did not re-

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

13

quire reversal of petitioner's conviction.  The court
observed that  "malice aforethought"  under 18 U.S. C.
1111(a) may be established by, inter alia, proof of
"intent serious bodily injury."  J.A. 78n.11.  The
court then explained:

The basic elements are the same for second de-
gree murder under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a) and first
degree murder under La. Rev. Stat.  14:30A(5).
Both statutes require proof of specific intent and
the killing of a human being. Regarding intent,
18 U.S.C. 1111 requires proof of  ''specific intent
to inflict serious bodily injury,"  and La. Rev.
Stat.  14:30A(5)  requires proof of "specific intent
to inflict great bodily harm."  * *  Though
labeled somewhat differently,  "intent to inflict
serious bodily injury"  and  "intent to inflict great
bodily harm" represent parallel intents for pur-
poses of evaluating these murder statutes.

J.A. 77-78  (footnote omitted).  Based on the statutory
elements of the state and federal crimes, and the
instructions given to the jury at petitioner's trial, the
court of appeals concluded that the elements of second
degree murder under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a) had been
proved by the government and found by the jury.  J.A.
78-80.
The court of appeals also concluded that a remand
for resentencing was unnecessary.  The court stated
that "[resentencing is only required where the
district court has imposed a sentence that exceeded
the maximum sentence that the defendant would have
received if sentenced under the applicable federal
statute."  J.A. 80.  The court observed that petitioner
"did not receive a sentence exceeding the maximum
sentence allowed under the federal murder statute,"

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

14

because federal law provides that persons convicted of
second degree murder may be imprisoned  "for any
term of years or for life."  Ibid.  (quoting 18 U.S.C.
1111(b)).  The court of appeals concluded on that basis
that it "need [not] remand for resentencing."  J.A. 80;
see Pet, App. 17.  5.
     
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

1.  Petitioner was properly charged and convicted
under the Assimilative Crimes Act and the Louisiana
child murder statute.  The fact that petitioner's con-
duct could have been prosecuted under the federal
murder statute does not make use of the ACA im-
proper.  Rather, the crucial question in this case is
whether Congress has focused directly on the appro
priate sanction for the specific class of conduct-
murder of a child under 12-that constitutes the state
offense.
That approach is consistent with this Court's de-
cisions and ensures that Louisiana law will apply
throughout the State unless it is in conflict with a
considered congressional policy judgment regarding

5  The court of appeals also rejected petitioner's challenge to
the sufficiency of the evidence and to the admission in into
evidence of certain photographs and of petitioners own state-
ments to investigators.  J.A. 81-91.  In addition, the court re-
jected petitioner's contention that Battered Women's Syn-
drome  "diminished her capacity to develop specific intent to
kill or inflict great bodily harm on Jadasha."  J.A. 91.  The
court explained that the record contained sufficient es idenc~
that petitioner acted with the requisite intent; that the jury
"heard and evaluated the testimony regarding Battered
Women's Syndrome"  and  "chose not to believe that the Syn-
drome affected her ability to develop the intent necessary to
commit murder"; and that there was  "no basis in the record to
disturb the jury's credibility choices."  Ibid.

the proper administration of federal enclaves.  Where
Congress has directly addressed the precise acts that
constitute the state offense, its judgment as to the
appropriate sanction for that conduct must take
precedence over the conflicting judgment of the State.
But where Congress has not addressed the relevant
conduct at the same level of specificity as the State,
prosecution under the ACA should not be foreclosed
by the existence of a more general federal statute
that subsumes the offense in question.
When it enacted the federal murder statute in 1909,
Congress simply codified what was at that time the
prevailing definition of murder in the large majority
of States.  Congress did not consider and reject an
existing state practice of treating the murder of
children as a particularly serious crime.  Since that
time, Congress has not addressed the subject of child
murder in any precise, direct, or focused manner,
either by enacting a child murder provision or -by
making a considered determination that the age of a
murder victim is irrelevant to the seriousness of the
offense.  The Louisiana child murder statute does not
conflict with any federal policy reflected in 18 U.S.C.
1111, and petitioner was properly convicted of the
assimilated state offense.
2.  If this Court holds that the assimilation of Lou-
isiana law was improper, the case should be remanded
for resentencing for the federal offense of second
degree murder.  In finding petitioner guilty on the
Louisiana child murder charge, the jury necessarily
found all of the elements of second degree murder
under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a).  Entry of a judgment of con-
viction for that offense would therefore be the appro-
priate remedy if this Court holds that the existence of
the federal murder statute precluded reliance on the

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

16

ACA.  The court of appeals erred, however, in con-
cluding that resentencing was unnecessary simply
because the terms of imprisonment imposed by the
district court fell within the statutory maximum
sentence for second degree murder under federal law.
Rather, petitioner should be resentenced under the
Sentencing Guidelines if this Court vacates her
conviction on the assimilated state offense and orders
entry of a judgment of conviction for second degree
murder under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a).
       
ARGUMENT

I.  PETITIONER WAS PROPERLY CHARGED AND
CONVICTED UNDER THE ASSIMILATIVE
CRIMES ACT AND THE LOUISIANA CHILD
MURDER STATUTE

Conduct occurring on federal enclaves is subject to
two distinct bodies of criminal law.  First, a number of
substantive criminal statutes define and punish of-
fenses committed  "within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States."  See,
e.g., 18 U.S.C.  81 (arson); 18 U.S.C.  113 (assault);
18 U.S.C.  1111 (murder); 18 U.S.C.  1201(a)(2) (kidnap-
ping).  Second, Congress has enacted the Assimilative
(Crimes Act, the purpose and effect of which is  "to
incorporate the criminal laws of the several States
* * *  into the statute and to make such criminal laws
to the extent of such incorporation laws of the United
States."  United States v.  Press Publishing Co., 219
U.S.  1, 8 (1911); see also id. at 10 (under the ACA,
assimilated state-law crime is  "punished as an offense
against the United States").  With predecessors dat-
ing from 1825, the ACA reflects a longstanding
federal policy that acts occurring on federal enclaves
should ordinarily be governed by the same legal rules,

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

17

and subject to the same punishments, as compara-
ble acts occurring in other areas of the State in which
the enclave is located.  See United States v.  Sharp-
nack, 355 U.S.  286, 293 (1958)  ("The basic legislative
decision made by Congress is its decision to con-
form the laws in the enclaves to the local laws as to
all offenses not punishable by any enactment of
Congress.").
At issue in this case is the manner in which those
two bodies of federal criminal law are appropriately
harmonized.  The ACA authorizes federal prosecution
where an  "act or omission"  on a federal enclave,  "al-
though not made punishable by any enactment of Con-
greases,"  would have violated the law of the State in
which the enclave is located. 18 U.S.C.  13(a). In our
view, a state offense is  "made punishable"  by an Act of
Congress for purposes of the ACA only when a
substantive federal statute focuses directly on the
specific class of conduct that constitutes the state
offense.  6.

___________________(footnotes)

6  The statute's current wording does not clearly indicate
that it is a prerequisite for conviction under the ACA that an
act is not  "made punishable"  under another federal statute.
See 18 U.S.C.  13(a)  (ACA applies to person who  "is guilty of
any act or omission which, although not made punishable by
any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed
or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State").  This Court
has stated, however, that the Act in its current form  "ex-
percale limits the assimilation to acts or omissions committed
within a federal enclave and `not made punishable by any
enactment of Congress.'"  Sharpnack, 355 U.S.  at 292. And
earlier versions of the ACA have unambiguously provided that
assimilation of a state-law offense is improper if that offense has
been defined and prohibited by an Act of Congress.  See, e.g.,
Act of March 3, 1825, ch. 65,  3, 4 Stat. 115 (authorizing
assimilation of any state-law offense "the punishment of which

Louisiana has made the murder of a child, with spe-
cific intent either to kill or to cause serious bodily
injury, a separate and distinct crime, punishable as
first degree murder.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14:30A(5).
The passage of the Louisiana child murder statute
reflects the State's view that  "[children  * * *  are
in the category of persons needing special prote-
ction. " Louisiana v.  Weiland,  505  So.2d 702,  709 &
n.31 (La. 1987).  Congress has enacted no law ad-
dressed specifically to the murder of children.  Nor
does the history of federal murder statute reveal
any deliberate congressional rejection of the judg-
ment, embodied in La. Rev. Stat.  Ann,  14:30A(5), that
the murder of children is a particularly serious
offense.  Because the Louisiana child murder statute
is not displaced by any conflicting federal law that
focuses directly on that conduct, the ACA authorizes
a federal prosecution that assimilates the Louisiana
child murder law.

A.  The Phrase  "Act Or Omission"  In The ACA
Refers To The State Law Offense That Sup-
port-s An ACA Charge
1.  This Court's most thorough discussion of the
ACA is contained in Williams v.  United States, 327
U.S.  711 (1946).  The defendant- in that case was
charged with having sexual intercourse with a female
between the ages of 16 and 18 in Indian country.  327
              
___________________(footnotes)

offence is not specifically provided for by any law of the
United States"'); Act of June 6 1940, ch. 241, 5-1 Stat. 234
(authorizing ACA prosecution of any person who  "shall do or
omit the doing of any act or thing which is not made penal by
any laws of Congress, but which  * * *  would be penal"  under
state law).  The Reviser's Notes accompanying the 1948 revi
sion stated that no substantive change was intended, See 18
U.S.C.  13 note.  [""Minor changes were made in phraseology.").

U.S.  at 713.  He was convicted of statutory rape,
pursuant to the ACA, under an Arizona statute that
set the age of consent at 18.  See id. at 713, 715-716.
At the time of the prosecution and conviction, Acts of
Congress applicable to federal enclaves defined the
separate crimes of rape, assault with intent to commit
rape, adultery, and fornication.  Id. at 713-714  &  nn. 4-
5, 7-8.  The Arizona statute defined the offense of rape
to include  "an act of sexual intercourse accomplished
with a female, not the wife of the perpetrator,  * * *
[w]here the female is under the age of eighteen  [18]
years."  327 U.S.  at 716 n.11.  Because the Arizona
statute applied only if the victim was  "not the wife of
the perpetrator,"  any act violative of the state law
would have constituted either adultery or fornication
under the federal statutes then in effect.  See id. at
714 nn. 7 & 8.  Federal law also defined the offense of
having carnal knowledge of a girl  (i.e., statutory
rape), but the statute applied only if the girl was less
than 16 years old.  Id. at 714 & 11.6.  This Court held
that the Arizona statutory rape provision, with its
higher age of consent, could not be assimilated under
the ACA, see id. at 717-725.
In explaining its conclusion that assimilation of the
state law was improper, the Court stated:

the [ACA] does not make the Arizona statute
applicable in the present case because  (1)  the
precise acts upon which the conviction depends
have been made penal by the laws of Congress
defining adultery and  (2)  the offense known to
Arizona as that of  "statutory rape"  has been
defined and prohibited by the Federal Criminal
Code, and is not to be redefined and enlarged by
application to it of the [ACA].

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------
20

327 U.S.  at 717  (footnotes omitted).  "The fact that the
definition of this offense as enacted by Congress
results in a narrower scope for the offense than that
given to it by the State,"  the Court stated,  "does not
mean that the Congressional definition must give way
to the State definition;"   id. at 717-718, because "a con-
flicting State definition does not enlarge the scope of
the offense defined by Congress,"  id. at 718.  In the
area of sexual offenses, the Court explained, Con-
gress had " covered the field with uniform legislation
affecting areas within the jurisdiction of Congress."
Id.  at 724. And in drafting the carnal knowledge stat-
ute in particular, Congress had given  "special atten-
tion to the age of consent."  Ibid. The Court there-
fore held that the Arizona statutory rape law could
not be applied to the federal enclave under the ACA.
Id. at 725.
The Court in Williams did not rest its holding
simply on the fact that the Arizona statutory rape law
covered conduct that would be subject to prosecu-
tion under federal adultery or fornication statutes.
Rather, after noting that Congress had made penal
the  "precise acts"  on which conviction depended, 327
U.S.  at 717, the court went on to examine at length
the specific relationship between state and federal
law, id.  at 717-725.  By its analysis, the Court thus
rejected any view that acts that constitute a state
crime are  "made punishable by any enactment of Con-
gress" for purposes of the ACA simply because it
might be possible to prosecute the general conduct at
issue under some federal criminal law.
2.  The approach taken in Williams is consistent
with the ACA's history.  Before the codification of the
federal criminal laws in 1909, the ACX provided that

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

21

when any offense is committed in any place
[under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States], the punishment for which offense is not
provided for by any law of the United States, the
person committing such offense shall  * * *  be
liable to and receive the same punishment as the
laws of the State in which such place is situated
now provide for the like offense when committed
within the jurisdiction of such State  * * * .
Act of July 7, 1898, ch. 576, 2, 30 Stat. 717; see also
Williams v.  United States, 327 U.S. at 722 n.23
(quoting Rev. Stat. 5391 (1878)).  As codified in 1909,
the Act applied to any person  "who shall do or omit
the doing of any act or thing which is not made penal
by any laws of Congress, but which * * *  would be
penal"  under state law.  Act of March 4, 1909, ch. 321,
289, 35 Stat. 1145.  The congressional report accom-
panying the 1909 codification did not suggest that
substitution of the phrase  "act or thing"  for the word
"offense"  was intended to alter the scope of the stat-
ute's coverage.  Rather, the report stated that  "[a]n
act which is not forbidden by law and to the commis-
sion of which no penalty is attached in no legal sense
can be denominated an 'offense.'  The section has there-
fore been rewritten so as to correctly express what
Congress intended when it enacted the section re-
ferred to."  H.R. Rep. No. 2, 60th Cong., 1st Sess. Pt.
I, at 25 (1908)  (quoted in Williams, 327 U.S.  at 722-723

The Court in Williams acknowledged that use of
the phrase  "act or thing"  in the 1909 codification may
have led courts or litigants  "to interpret it in a spe-
cific sense as referring to individual acts of the
parties rather than in a generic sense referring to

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------
         
22

acts of a general type or kind."  327 U.S.  at 722.  The
Court observed, however, that  "the expressed purpose
of the Committee  [was]  to continue, rather than to
change,  [the Act`s]  original meaning."  Id. at 723,
Thus, the ACA in its current form-like the pre-1909
version-should be read to appIy when the state law
offense that forms the basis for a federal charge under
the ACA has not separately been  "made punishable"
as a federal crime.
3.  To treat the ACA as inapplicable whenever the
defendant's primary conduct happens to violate some
federal law would produce incongruous results and
would undermine the effectuation of the statutory
purposes.  Under that approach, for example, peti-
tioner's conviction on the assimilated state charge in
this case would have been improper even if there were
no federal murder statute, since her conduct would
ave constituted assault under federal law.  See 18
U.S.C.  113.  More generally, there is no sound reason
that Congress would have intended to preclude the
adoption of a state criminal provision for crimes on
enclaves simply because the defendant's conduct
fort fortuitously violates a federal law directed at a differ-
ent evil.  That approach would  (albeit in somewhat
less stark form)  reintroduce the problem that precipi-
tated the initial passage of the ACA-i.e., the danger
that an individual who commits what would otherwise
be a state law offense on a federal enclave might
escape appropriate punishment because state officials
lack jurisdiction and Congress has not focused its
attention on the offense in question. See pages 4-5,
supra.
4.  The courts of appeals have repeatedly sustained
convictions for assimilated state crimes under the
ACA, even where the defendant's conduct would also

have been subject to prosecution under a federal 
criminal statute.  7.  The decisions most closely on
point have recognized, in particular, that state laws
prohibiting the-abuse of children may properly be
applied in federal enclaves under the Assimilative
Crimes Act, even where the conduct at issue is also
violative of a more general federal law.  8.  Indeed, peti-
tioner concedes that ,"the government could have
prosecuted the defendant under the federal second
degree murder statute and assimilated the state

B.  The Offense Of Child Murder Under Louisiana
Law Is Not  "Made Punishable"  By The Federal
Murder Statute

The crucial question in this case is whether child
murder, as defined by Louisiana law, is an offense
"made punishable by any enactment of Congress."  18
U.S.C.  13(a).  The indictment in this case alleged that
petitioner "did, with specific intent to inflict great
bodily harm, commit first degree murder of Jadasha
D.  Lowery, a human being under the age of twelve
years, in violation of Title 14, Louisiana Revised
Statutes Annotated, Section [30A(5)]."  J..A. 3.  The
district court instructed the jury that the elements of
the charged offense were that  (1)  petitioner  "killed
Jadasha Lowery,"  (2)  petitioner  "acted with specific
intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm,"  and  (3)
"[t]he victim was under twelve years of age."  J.A. 31.
Thus, the  "offense"  with which petitioner was
charged and convicted was child murder-a subcate-
gory of first degree murder as defined by Louisiana
law.  Viewed under the correct standard, that assimil-
ated state offense would be  "made punishable"  by an
Act of Congress only if Congress has focused directly
in federal criminal law on the appropriate sanction for
the specific class of conduct-murder of a child under
12-that constitutes the state offense.  That approach
is consistent with this.  Court's decisions and furthers
the purposes of the ACA by ensuring that Louisiana
criminal law will be enforceable throughout the State

except when it conflicts with a considered congres-
sional policy judgment regarding the proper admini-
stration of federal enclaves. In this case, no such
conflict exists: although Congress has addressed the
general subject of murder in federal enclaves, it has
not directed its attention to the murder of children.
1.  As this Court has recognized, the Assimilative
Crimes Act must be construed in light of Congress's
intent to minimize disparities between the criminal
laws applicable to federal enclaves and those that
govern the surrounding areas. Thus, the Court has
observed that

Congress, in adopting  [the ACA], sedulously con-
sidered the two-fold character of our constitu-
tional government, and had in view the enlight-
ened purpose, so far as the punishment of crime
was concerned, to interfere as little as might be
with the authority of the States on that subject
over all territory situated within their exterior
boundaries, and which hence would be subject to
exclusive state jurisdiction but for the existence
of a United States reservation.

United States v.  Press Publishing Co., 219 U.S.  1, 9
(1911).  With the ACA, this Court has recognized,
"Congress has  * * *  provided that within each fed-
eral enclave, to the extent that offenses are not pre-
empted by congressional enactments, there shall be
complete current conformity with the criminal laws
of the respective States in which the enclaves are
situated."  United  States v.   Sharpnack , 355 U.S.  286,
293 (1958); see also id. at 294  (ACA "is a practical
accommodation of the mechanics of the legislative
functions of State and Nation in the field of police
power where it is especially appropriate to make the

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

26

federal regulation of local conduct conform to that
already established by the State").  "The basic legis-
lative decision made by Congress is its decision to
conform the laws in the enclaves to the local laws as
to all offenses not punishable by any enactment of
Congress."  Id. at 296.
In view of the ACA's policy of conformity to state
criminal law on federal enclaves, the applicability of
the Act should give way only when the state law
sought to be assimilated conflicts directly with fed-
eral policy as reflected in substantive criminal stat-
utes.  Where Congress has directly addressed the
specific class of conduct that constitutes the state
offense, assimilation of a state criminal law pursuant
to the ACA is either superfluous  (if Congress has
defined and punished the offense in precisely the same
manner as the State)  or inconsistent with federal
policy. But where Congress has not addressed the
relevant conduct at the same level of specificity as the
State, no such conflict exists.  Assimilation of the
state offense should not be precluded by the existence
of a more general federal statute that subsumes the
offense in question.
The courts of appeals have often phrased the test as
whether the  "precise act"  proscribed by state law is
also the subject of a federal prohibition.  See, e.g.,
United States v.  Brown, 608 F.2d 551, 554 (5th Cir.
1979)  ("Although the acts with which the defendant
was charged could be punishable under the federal
assault statute, the precise act of injury to a child is
not proscribed by federal law."); United States v.
Minger, 978 F.2d 185, 189 (4th Cir. 1992); United
States v.  Sasnett,  925 F.2d 392, 396 (11th Cir. 1991);
United States v.  Kaufman, 862 F.2d 236, 237-238 (9th
Cir. 1988);  Fields  v.  United States, 438 F.2d 205, 208

27

(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S.  907 (1971).  The  "pre-
cise act"  test, as developed in the lower courts, fo-
cuses on whether Congress has spoken directly to the
specific class of conduct that constitutes the state
offense.  9.
Properly understood, the precise act test is a
means of determining whether the state law sought to
be assimilated conflicts with any clearly articulated
congressional policy choice.  Where a substantive fed-
eral criminal statute directly addresses the  "precise
act"  that constitutes the state offense, and prescribes
a different sanction than does state law, use of the
ACA would have the practical effect of permitting the
State's policy judgment to supersede that of Con-
gress.  Under those circumstances, Congress's deter-
mination regarding the appropriate administration of
federal enclaves must override the desire for uniform
application of criminal laws throughout a State.
Where Congress has addressed the relevant conduct
only at a higher level of generality, however, there is
no precisely focused federal policy judgment with
which the state law can be said to conflict.  Under
those circumstances, assimilation of state law fur-
thers the purposes of the ACA by ensuring that
federal legislation  "interfere[s] as little as might be
with the authority of the States"  regarding the defi-
nition and punishment of crimes committed within
their borders.  Press Publishing, 219 U.S. at 9.

9  The phrase  "precise act"  bears a different  meaning  in  this
context than in Williams, since the Court in Williams used that
phrase in noting that the defendant's particular conduct was
covered by federal law the Court did not define the "precise
act"  by reference to state law.  See 327 U.S.  at 717  (noting that
"the precise acts upon which the conviction depends have been
made penal by the laws of Congress defining adultery").

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

That conclusion is consistent with the approach
taken in Williams .  The crux of the Court's analysis
was its determination that the state and federal stat-
utes combined  "conflicting"  definitions of the same
offense.  327 U.S.  at 718.  In reaching that conclusion,
the Court attached significance to the fact that Con-
gress in enacting the carnal knowledge statute  "gave
special attention to the age of consent,"  and adopted a
standard inconsistent with that adopted by Arizona.
Id. at 724; see also id.  at 725 n.29 (noting Congress's
awareness that the age of consent in the federal law
was lower than that employed by some States).  10.

___________________(footnotes)
                               
10  As the Williams Court noted, the government did not
defend the court of appeals' judgment affirming Williams'
conviction.  See 327 U.S.  at 719.  In its brief to this Court in
Williams, the government stated that assimilation of the
Arizona offense would have been appropriate if Congress, in
enacting the federal carnal knowledge statute, had intended
only to  "set the age of sixteen as the minimum, but not the
maximum, age of consent  for all areas of  federal jurisdiction."
Gov't Br. 19 (O.T. 19-45, No. 123).  To construe the carnal
knowledge statute in that fashion, the government acknowl
edge (edged, would  "obviate[] the anomaly whereby an act committed
in the state of Arizona is criminal or innocent depending upon
whether it took place on one side of the boundary line of the
Indian Reservation or the other,"  and it would  "minimize[] the
area of possible conflict between the policies of the federal and
the state governments."  Id. at 19-20.  The government
concluded, however, that
  
[i]n respect of the carnal knowledge statute, we know
that  Congress  gave  careful  consideration  to  the  problem
or fixing an age of consent and that it recognized that
the age which it fixed differed from the age adopted by
some of the states.  It is evident  that by fixing the age at
sixteen Congress not only provided that girls under
sixteen were incapable of consenting to the proscribed
acts, but inferentially Congress regarded girls sixteen or

Williams thus establishes that the general applicabil-
ity of the ACA yields when Congress has made a
conflicting policy choice on the definition of the
precise conduct that constitutes the crime.  See also
United States v.  Sharpnack, 355 U.S.  at 296  &  n.9
(noting that the ACA broadly adopts local law
"because the laws are already in force throughout the
state in which the enclave is located,"  but declining to
"pass upon the effect of the  [ACA]  where an assimi-
lated state law conflicts with a specific federal
criminal statute.  Cf. Williams v.  United States.").
2.  Thus, the dispositive issue in this case is
whether the provisions of 18 U.S.C.  1111(a) reflect a
considered congressional determination that the age
of a murder victim has no bearing on the seriousness
of the offense, so as to create a conflict with Louisi-
ana law.  The answer to that question is no, The his-
tory of the federal murder statute does not Suggest
that Congress considered and rejected the view that
murder of a youthful victim is more reprehensible
than murder of an adult. Rather, Congress simply
codified what was at that time the prevailing defini-
tion of murder as reflected in the large majority of
state criminal codes.  Because Congress has not ad-
dressed the subject of child murder in any direct or
focused manner-either by enacting a federal child
murder provision, or by making a considered deter-

over as being capable of intelligently consenting to the
acts in question.
Gov't  Br. 20  (0.T. 1945, No. 123). Thus, the government's con-
clusion that the federal carnal knowledge statute  "conflicted]
with local policy"  (id. at 21), was based on the fact that Con-
gress had deliberately chosen an age of consent at variance
with the laws of some States.

mination that the age of a murder victim should not be
relevant in assessing the severity of the crime-the
offense of  which petitioner was convicted is not  "made
punishable by any enactment of Congress."  18 U.S.C.
13(a).  11.
The federal murder statute was first codified in
1909 as part of a  "general revision and codification of
federal statutes.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2, 60th Cong., 1st
Sess.  Pt. I, at 12 (1908).  Before that time, there
was no federal statutory definition of the crimes of
murder or manslaughter.  Rather, Revised Statutes
5339 (1878) simply provided that whoever  "[w]ithin
any fort, arsenal, dock-yard, magazine, or in any other
place or district of country under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States  * * *  maliciously
strikes, stabs, wounds, poisons, or shoots at any other
person, of which striking, stabbing, wounding, poison-

11  Both Williams and this case involved general federal
statutes-here, Section 1111(a); there, the federal adultery 
law-that encompassed  the defendant's  conduct.  In each case, a
State had determined that conduct falling within the general
federal prohibition was particular blameworthy if the victim
was especially young.  (As  noted  above, see  page 19, supra ,  any
act violative of the Arizona statutory rape law at issue in
Williams would also have violated the federal adultery or
fornication law.)  The crucial difference between the cases is
that in Williams,  Congress had directly addressed the question
whether (and under what circumstances) the youth of the
victim warranted an additional criminal sanction, and had
resolved that question in- a manner inconsistent with the
judgment of the State.   As  we  explain in text, Congress has not
similarly focused its attention on the question whether murder 
of  a  child is properly treated  as a particularly serious crime.

suffer death."  12.  In the 1909 codification of the federal
criminal laws, Congress for the first time defined
murder:

Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being
with malice aforethought.  Every murder perpe-
trated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind
of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated
killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or
attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary,
or robbery or perpetrated from a premeditated
design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the
death of any human being other than him who is
killed, is murder in the first degree.  Any other
murder is murder in the second degree.

Act of March 4, 1909, ch. 321, 273, 35 Stat. 1143.
The special commission appointed in 1897 to revise
and codify the federal criminal and penal laws ex-
plained that virtually all the States had statutes
defining homicide with malice and premeditation as
murder in the first degree; homicide with malice, but
without premeditation, as murder in the second
degree; and homicide without malice or premeditation
as manslaughter.  13.  The Commission stated that

___________________(footnotes)

12  Section 5339 had its origin in the first Federal Crimes
Act, which provided:  "[I]f any person  or  persons  shall, within
any fort, arsenal,  dock-yard,  magazine,  or  in  any  other  place or
district of country, under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States, commit the crime of wilful murder, such
person or persons on being thereof convicted shall suffer
death."  Act of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, 3, 1 Stat. 113; see  United
States v.  Kaiser, 545 F.2d 467, 478 (5th Cir. 1977) (Ainsworth,

"[t]hese lines of demarcation have been observed in

of  the Commission  to Revise  and Codify  the  Laws of
the United States 130 (1908].  The House Report
likewise explained that the definition of murder then
adopted was  "similar in terms to the statutes defining
murder in a large majority of the States."  H.R. Rep.
No. 2, supra, at 24.
Thus, in codifying and defining the federal crime of
murder, Congress simply adopted the definition then
prevailing in the great majority of the States. See-
tion 1111(a)  continues substantially to incorporate 
the definition of murder that prevailed in 1909.  14.  Con-

(1976); McGautha v.  California, 402 U.S.  183, 138 (1971).
Pennsylvania had led the way with its 1794 a abolishment of
capital punishment except for "murder of the first degree,"
which was defined to include all "willful, deliberate and
premeditated" killings. The other States gradually followed
suit. McGautha, 402 U.S. at 198; Woodson,  428  U.S. at  290;
Davis  v. People  of  Territory of Utah,  151 U.S.  262, 330 (1894).
14  The  definition  of  murder  contained  in  the federal  crimi-
nal code has remained largely unchanged since its enactment in
1909.  As part-of  the  Comprehensive  Crime  Control Act of 1981,
Congress amended Section 111l(a)'s  definition of first  degree
murder by adding to the enumerated four felony murder of-
fenses the offenses of escape, murder, kidnaping, treason, es-
pionage,  and  sabotage.   Act  of  October  12, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98
473, Title II, 1004, 98 Stat. 2138. In 1986, as part of the Crimi-
nal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986,
Congress struck out  "rape"  and in its place inserted "aggra-
vated  sexual  abuse  or  sexual  abuse." Act  of November 14, 1986,
Pub. L. No. 99-654,  87(c)(4), 100 Stat. 3623. The  same  change
was also effected by the Sexual  Abuse Act  of 1986, Pub. L. No.

ing new law.  Congress did not, in particular, consider
and reject an existing state practice of treating the
murder of children as a particularly serious crime.
The various state criminal codes reflect a diverse
array of developing legislative judgments regarding
the categories of murder that should be treated as
particularly culpable.  If the federal murder statute is
regarded as  "occupying the field,"  those state legisla-
tive judgments will have no force or effect with
respect to conduct occurring on federal enclaves.
That result would undermine the ACA's purpose of
"maintaining current conformity with state criminal
laws; Sharpnack, 355 U.S.  at 291, in locations sub-
ject to exclusive federal jurisdiction. That result
should not be reached here.  Because the Louisiana
child murder statute does not conflict with any
federal policy reflected in 18 U.S.C.  1111, petitioner
was properly convicted of the assimilated state
offense.  15.

___________________(footnotes)

15  Because petitioner was properly tried and convicted
pursuant to the Louisiana child murder statute and the ACA,
her sentence of life imprisonment was consistent with-indeed,
dictated by-applicable law.  The Assimilative Crimes Act pro-
vides that a person who commits a state crime on a federal
enclave  "shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like
punishment."  18 U.S.C.  13(a).  In sentencing a defendant con-
victed of an assimilated state crime, a court generally applies
the Sentencing Guidelines provisions applicable to the most
closely analogous federal crime.  State law, however, establishes
both the minimum and maximum penalties to which the defen-
dant may be exposed.  See United  States  v.  Pierce, 75 F.3d 171,

II.  IF THIS COURT HOLDS THAT THE ASSIMI-
LATION OF LOUISIANA LAW WAS IM-
PROPER, THE CASE SHOULD BE RE-
MANDED FOR RESENTENCING FOR THE
FEDERAL OFFENSE OF SECOND DEGREE
MURDER

If this Court holds that assimilation of the Louisi-
ana child murder statute was improper, this case
should be remanded for resentencing on the federal
offense of second degree murder.  Because the essen-
tial elements of federal second degree murder were
proved at trial and found by the jury, the district
court may properly enter a judgment of conviction
under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a) if that statute is held to
render the ACA inapplicable.  The court of appeals
erred, however, in holding that petitioner's sentence
of life imprisonment could be affirmed on the ground
that it fell within the statutory maximum sentence
for second degree murder under federal law.  Rather,
petitioner should be resentenced under the Guidelines
provisions applicable to second degree murder.
A.  "Where the government wrongfully secures a
conviction under a state statute pursuant to the As-
similative Crimes Act, rather than under the relevant
federal statute, the appropriate remedy is not a rever-

resentencing"  on the federal offense.  United States v.

States v.  Chaussee, 536 F.2d 637, 644-645 (7th Cir.

berry v.  United States, 422 F.2d 171, 174 (9th Cir.
1970).  So long as the essential elements of the pre-
emptive federal crime have been proved at trial and
found by the jury, the absence of specific submission
to the jury of the federal offense does not preclude the
district court from entering a judgment of conviction.
Cf. Rutledge v.  United States, 116 S. Ct. 1241, 1250
(1996)  ("[Federal appellate courts appear to have
uniformly concluded that they may direct the entry of
judgment for a lesser included offense when a convic-
tion for a greater offense is reversed on grounds that
affect only the greater offense.  * * *  This Court has
noted the use of such a practice with approval.").
The federal murder statute provides that "[m]urder
is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice
aforethought,"  and that any murder that does not con-
stitute first degree murder "is murder in the second
degree."  18 U.S.C.  1111(a).  In this case, the court of
appeals correctly held that the government had
proved, and the jury had found in returning its verdict
on the assimilated state charge, all of the elements of
federal second degree murder.   J.A.   77-80.  The court
noted in particular that Section 1111 (a)'s requirement
of  "malice aforethought"  could be established by proof
that petitioner acted with specific intent to inflict
serious bodily injury. J.A. 78 & n.11.
That construction of the federal murder statute is
consistent with the historical understanding of "mal-
ice aforethought."  "The common-law crime of murder

was the unlawful killing of a human being with
'malice aforethought' or 'malice prepense,' which
consisted of an intention to kill or grievously injure,
knowledge that an act or omission would probably
cause death or grievous injury, an intention to com-
mit a felony, or an intention to resist lawful arrest. "
Schad v.  Arizona, 501 U.S.  624,648 (1991) (Scalia, .J.,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.).
Accord,  e.g., O. Holmes, The  Common  Law  44 (Howe          
al. 1963) ("malice aforethought"  includes  "[a]n inten-
tion to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to,
any person")  (quoting Stephen, Digest of Criminal 
Law); W. LaFave & A Scott, Criminal Law 616 (2d
ed. 1986) ("English judges came to hold that one who
intended to do serious bodily injury short of death, but
who actually succeeded in killing, was guilty of
murder in spite of his lack of an intent to kill.").  16.  The
federal murder statute should be construed in a man-
ner consistent with that historical understanding.
See, e.g., United States v.  Shabani, 513 U.S.  10, 13
(1994)  (noting "the settled principle of statutory
construction that, absent contrary indications,

Malice  Aforethought, 43 Yale  L. J. 537, 552-555 (1984) (discuss-

Congress intends to adopt the common law definition
of statutory terms.").
In accordance with the language of the Louisiana
child murder statute, the district court instructed
the jury that it could find petitioner guilty only if it
found that she had  "killed Jadasha D. Lowery"  and
that she had "acted with specific intent to kill or
inflict great bodily harm."  J.A. 31.  In finding peti-
tioner guilty on the basis of that instruction, the jury
necessarily found all of the elements of second degree
murder under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a).  If petitioner's con-
viction on the assimilated state charge is held to be
improper, the appropriate remedy is a remand for
entry of a judgment of conviction on the federal
offense of second degree murder.  17.
B.  The court of appeals also held that there was no ,
need for resentencing on the federal offense of second

17  The indictment in this case charged that petitioner "did,
with specific intent to inflict great bodily harm, commit first
degree murder of Jadasha D. Lowery."  J.A. 3.  The indict-
ment thereby alleged the essential elements of second degree
murder under 18 U.S.C.  1111(a).  The fact that the indictment
relied (see J.A. 3-4; note 4, supra) on the ACA and Louisiana
law, rather than on Section 1 Ill(a), does not preclude entry of
a judgment of conviction for federal second degree murder if
the Court finds that disposition to be otherwise appropriate.
"In order to determine whether an indictment charges an
offense against the United States, designation by the pleader of
the statute under which he purported to lay the charge is
immaterial.  He may have conceived the charge under one
statute which would not sustain the indictment but it may
nevertheless come within the terms of another statute."
United States v.  Hutcheson, 312 U.S.  219, 229 (1941).  See Fed.
R. Crim. P. 7(c)(3)  ("Error in the citation or its omission shall
not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or information or
for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not
mislead the defendant to the defendant's prejudice.").

degree murder because petitioner's sentence of life
imprisonment fell within the statutory maximum
penalty for that offense.  See LA. 80.  We do not agree.
See Br. in Opp. 17-18 n.10.  If the jury had found peti-
tioner guilty of second degree murder under federal
law, the district court would have been requircd t.o
utilize the Sentencing Guidlines provisions applica-
ble to that offense, and the court might have imposed a
sentence below the statutory maximum.  18.  An upward
departure from that range, if appropriate, could reach
the statutory maximum of a life sentencer but it is for
the district court in the first instance to make such a
determination. Koon v.  United States, 116 S. Ct. 2035,
2045 (1996)  (departures are reviewable only for abuse
of discretion); cf. Williams v.  United States, 503 U.S.
193, 205 (1993)  (Guidelines appeal provisions did not
transfer initial sentencing responsibility to courts
of appeals).  Resentencing under the Guidelines is
therefore appropriate if this Court vacates peti-
tioner's conviction on the assimilated state offense
and orders entry of a judgment of conviction for
federal second degree murder.

18  Sentencing Guidelines  2A1.2 establishes a base offense
level of 33 for second  degree murder.  After adding two points
for the vulnerable victim adjustment, Guidelines  3A 1.1,
petitioner's offense level would be 35, and her sentencing
range, as an offender in Criminal History Category I, would be
166-210 months imprisonment.

CONCLUSION

The judgment of the court of appeals should be
affirmed. In the alternative, the judgment of the court
of appeals should be vacated and the ease remanded to
the district court for entry of a judgment of con-
viction for second degree murder under 18 U.S.C.
1111(a), and for resentencing on that offense.
