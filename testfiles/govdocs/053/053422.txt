_In Brief_
Letter from National Advisory Group
The members of the National Advisory Group on
Collection-Building Activities wish to thank their fellow
patrons and librarians for their input on the NLS program. 
Please be assured that your ideas and suggestions were
thoroughly discussed and incorporated into the
recommendations that the committee made during its
deliberations in September 1997.  Copies of recommendations
from the September meeting and NLS responses to the
suggestions are available upon request by writing to
Consumer Relations, National Library Service for the Blind
and Physically Handicapped, Washington, DC  20542 or by
e-mail to nls@loc.gov.  Please indicate whether you prefer
large-print, audio cassette, or braille format.  
     The group meets again at NLS on September 16-18, 1998. 
Please continue to assist us by contacting committee members
or your cooperating library with your suggestions.  Certain
suggestions, such as the addition of a recommended book, are
time-consuming to implement because of the many production
and quality-checking steps in the audio recording and
brailling processes.  Do not let these time constraints
discourage you from forwarding your comments. Input from
readers is a key ingredient in the success of our program.
The NLS National Advisory Group represents you.
