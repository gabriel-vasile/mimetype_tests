<H2><A NAME="RTFToC1">Lab Science Shines During Open House</A></H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>undreds of eager volunteers and a perfect fall day
greeted an estimated 6,000-plus visitors to the Lab's second Open House, held on
Saturday, Oct. 18. Guests at the six-hour event included townfolk, tourists, Lab
employees and their families, and young people from kindergartners to graduate
students. From grandparents to toddlers, visitors arrived by the busload or
hiked up the hill for an intimate look at the sometimes mysterious-seeming
goings-on at Berkeley Lab.
<P>&quot;A World of Great Science&quot; was the event's title; visitors got
great science and more. After examining the world's most powerful dipole magnet,
manipulating images of tiny crystal structures on the Atomic Resolution
Microscope, watching a phalanx of robotic gene sequencers move through their
paces, or taking in any of numerous other tours, lectures, and exhibits,
visitors could enjoy refreshments at the food tents and listened to live music.
Music groups included Lab musicians who played rhythm and blues, jazz, rock and
roll, and even performed Scottish dances on the lawn in front of the cafeteria.
<P><B>Seaborg honored</B>
<P>Associate-Director-at-Large Glenn Seaborg was honored at a noontime ceremony
in front of Bldg. 50 for his many contributions to science, culminating in the
recent official designation of the element seaborgium, element 106. Director
Charles Shank led the tribute, citing Seaborg's inspiration to generations of
scientists, including himself. October 18 was proclaimed &quot;Glenn Seaborg
Day&quot; in the City of Berkeley by Mayor Shirley Dean. Seaborg received
trophies which ranged from the sublime--an up-to-date periodic table of the
elements made of crystal and presented by the Lab--to the ridiculous: a &quot;Flubber&quot;
baseball cap presented by the Walt Disney Company, which also gave children in
the audience posters of the new movie starring Robin Williams. (Seaborgium is
apparently crucial in making flubber.) Seaborg responded to it all with what
Kira Thomsen-Cheek of the Open House task force describes as &quot;dry
wit.&quot;
<P>Later Seaborg spent hours talking with young visitors and signing copies of
the periodic table. &quot;I saw him surrounded by 30 delighted kids who were
craning their necks to look up at him,&quot; says Roberta Boucher, the
director's liaison to the task force.
<P>One young woman with a Seaborg-autographed table of elements later showed up
at the 88-Inch Cyclotron and peppered its director, Claude Lyneis, with
questions. &quot;Boy, was she charged up,&quot; Lyneis says. &quot;She'd made up
her mind that she wanted to spend her life doing nuclear science.&quot;
<P>According to Lyneis, the somewhat out-of-the-way 88-Inch Cyclotron got
&quot;as many people as we could deal with,&quot; and the centrally-located
Advanced Light Source was mobbed. &quot;It was a thrill dealing face-to-face
with people,&quot; says Art Robinson, who was crammed into a cave explaining the
storage ring's magnets to visitors &quot;awed by this monster they were looking
at. They were very enthusiastic, very curious about what we were doing here. It
was hard to get people to leave.&quot;
<P><B>Children had a field day</B>
<P>No one was more enthusiastic than the children: tearing delicate electronic
hardware to pieces with screwdrivers at the &quot;electronic petting zoo&quot;
inside the ALS; on the porch outside, oohing, ahhing, and giggling at the sight
of bloated, dehydrated marshmallows; or shrieking with delight as they smashed
broccoli stalks they had just immersed in liquid nitrogen to smithereens.
<P>Children dragged their parents behind them all over the hill as they
collected stamps on their passports from such locations as the Fire House, the
Advanced Engineering Technology Labs' glass-blowing demonstration, or from
volunteer college students, who popped questions like &quot;Is an electron
bigger or smaller than the tip of a pencil?&quot; The youngsters' correct
answers were rewarded with stamps and stickers.
<P>Kids were everywhere--from the Science Discovery Theater in Bldg. 66, to the
Family Science Tents behind Bldg. 70. &quot;We had to struggle to fit them all
in,&quot; says volunteer Marilyn Chartock. &quot;We kept sending for more
supplies.&quot;
<P>That science can be as much fun for older kids and for adults was amply
demonstrated in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing center's
visualization lab, where molecular structures seemed to come right out of the
screen over the heads of front-row observers--and were manipulated by some
visitors to the verge of motion-sickness. A web-surfing exhibit, partly staffed
by six volunteers from Silicon Graphics, Inc. and stocked with 20 terminals on
loan from SGI, allowed visitors to morph a person's live, on-screen head into a
pointy cable and tie it in a knot.
<P><B>First Open House paved the way</B>
<P>&quot;It really helped to have the Open House two years ago under our
belt,&quot; says Roberta Boucher. &quot;We put what we learned to use, with more
and better signs, more parking and shuttle buses, and more hands-on
exhibits.&quot; Starting at the central exhibit area, visitors found their way
to every part of the Lab, from medical imaging exhibits to talks on the theory,
application, and life-style of science, to tours of the waste management
facility.
<P>Boucher calls the Open House task force &quot;an incredible group to work
with--a dozen `outreach types' plus representatives from 20 divisions and
programs and some 500 volunteers. We had no medical emergencies, no lost kids,
and of the 220 questionnaires we handed out, more than 95 percent came back with
tremendously positive responses.&quot;
<P>Perhaps the best measure of the second Open House's success was the combined
exhilaration and exhaustion on the faces of people making their way down the
hill after a day spent looking close-up at Berkeley Lab's world of great
science.

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC3">Transgenic Mice May Lead to Sickle Cell Treatment</A></H2>
<B>By Lynn Yarris</B>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>enetically engineered mice that fully mimic all the
symptoms of human sickle cell disease have been developed by scientists here at
Berkeley Lab. With this new mouse model, medical researchers finally have a
means of effectively testing experimental treatments for the disease.
<P>A team led by Dr. Chris Pászty of the Life Sciences Division has reported
the creation of a new strain of mice that carries human hemoglobin genes with no
counteracting mouse genes. This enables the mice to develop all clinical
manifestations of the sickle cell disease.
<P>The research has been reported in this week's issue (Oct. 31) of the magazine
Science. In addition to Pászty, other members of the team from Life Sciences
included Catherine Brion, Mary Stevens, Mohandas Narla, and Edward Rubin. Also
contributing were Ewa Witkowska of the Children's Hospital Oakland Research
Institute and Elizabeth Manci of the University of South Alabama Doctors
Hospital.
<P>Each year approximately 100,000 babies in the world, mostly of African
descent, are born with sickle cell disease, a painful and debilitating condition
caused by a mutant hemoglobin gene. Although sickle cell disease has been
extensively studied, there is still no effective treatment--a failure attributed
in part to the lack of an animal model that accurately reproduces the disease's
symptoms.
<P>&quot;This work marks the end of an almost decade-long effort to create mice
that faithfully model human sickle cell disease,&quot; Pászty says.
<P>Transgenic mice containing the human sickle genes have been engineered
before, but these mice developed only mild symptoms of the disease. The problem
was that in addition to carrying the mutant human genes responsible for sickle
cell disease, these strains also carried normal mouse genes which counteracted
the defective human genes.
<P>&quot;Through a series of complex transgenic and gene knock-out
manipulations, we were able to add the appropriate human genes as well as delete
the (corresponding) mouse genes,&quot; says Pászty. &quot;The end products are
mice with irreversibly sickled red blood cells, anemia, and multi-organ
pathology. In contrast to the limited studies that can be performed in humans,
these animals provide an opportunity for rapidly performing a wide range of
experiments. They should play an important role in furthering our understanding
of sickle cell disease and in developing improved therapies for treating sickle
cell patients.&quot;
<P>Sickle cell disease was once referred to as sickle cell anemia, but the term
&quot;anemia&quot; was dropped because it emphasized only one manifestation of
the condition. Victims inherit from both their parents a gene that makes a
mutant form of hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in red blood cells which
carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
<P>This mutant form of hemoglobin is called &quot;hemoglobin S.&quot;
<P>Under certain physiological stresses, such as a decrease in oxygen, the
hemoglobin S protein will polymerize, forming a rigid chain that may distort a
blood cell into the shape of a &quot;sickle.&quot; Lacking the flexibility of
normal disc-shaped cells, these sickled cells are unable to squeeze through
capillaries. This impairs the flow of blood, reducing the body's supply of
oxygen. Damage from the reduction in oxygen accumulates, causing cell death in
various tissues, most notably in the kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen. This
leads to organ dysfunction and ultimately results in death.
<P>All hemoglobin is made up of two polypeptide chains--an alpha globin and a
beta globin chain. Sickling occurs when a hemoglobin protein with a normal alpha
globin chain and a mutant beta S globin chain precipitates out of solution
during a state of deoxygenation.
<P>Creation of the new sickle cell mouse model began about five years ago when
Berkeley Lab researchers set out to engineer two new strains of knock-out mice:
one which would no longer produce mouse alpha globin and one which would no
longer produce mouse beta globin. At about the same time that Lab scientists
created the knock-out mice which did not produce mouse alpha globin chains, a
research group led by Dr. Tim Townes of the University of Alabama at Birmingham
succeeded in creating knock-out mice which did not produce any mouse beta globin
chains.
<P>&quot;Rather than duplicating each others' work we exchanged knock-out mice
and then went our separate ways in terms of creating the human sickle hemoglobin
transgenics,&quot; says Pászty. &quot;It worked out well for both of our
groups, because after the long process of breeding these three strains of mice
together we both managed to create mice with sickle cell disease.&quot;
<P>Townes and his collaborators also published a paper describing their
sickle-cell-diseased mice in the Oct. 31 issue of Science magazine.
<P>With experts predicting a worldwide surge in the incidence of sickle cell
disease, the perfection of this mouse model is extremely timely. Mice are highly
valued for medical research because their physiology is quite similar to that of
humans, they are fast-breeding, and their small size makes them easy to maintain
and handle in large numbers.
<P>Development of the sickle cell mouse was funded by grants from the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and by the National Institute for Diabetes,
Digestive, and Kidney Diseases.

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC4">Lab Detectors Measure Cosmic Rays Aboard NASA's ACE
Spacecraft</A></H2>
<B>By Paul Preuss</B>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>erkeley Lab's Engineering Division has provided the
heart of one of nine experiments aboard NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer
(ACE), a satellite launched last August to study the &quot;composition&quot; of
outer space: the solar corona, the interplanetary and local-interstellar media,
and the makeup of the galaxy itself. Cosmic rays offer one of the best ways to
sample the Milky Way at high energies, and that's what CRIS--the Cosmic Ray
Isotope Spectrometer--was built to do.
<P>Designed by a consortium led by Caltech astrophysicists, CRIS consists of 60
lithium-ion-compensated silicon detectors, each three millimeters thick and 100
millimeters in diameter. The Si(Li) detectors measure the total energy of
incoming cosmic ray heavy nuclei and the rate of energy loss as the nuclei come
to a stop. The data is combined with input from a trajectory detector of
fiber-optic planes, which sits on top of the stacks of silicon detectors, to
determine the mass and atomic number of each cosmic ray nucleus. CRIS is
designed to observe all the stable or long-lived nuclei up through Z=30 (zinc)
in the periodic table.
<P>&quot;Starting with ISEE-3, the Third International Sun-Earth Explorer
launched in 1978, we've built similar experiments for six of the last seven
satellites of this kind,&quot; says Jack Walton of the Measurement Science Group
in the division's Engineering Science Department.
<P>Each new cosmic-ray &quot;telescope&quot; has presented the Measurement
Science Group with greater challenges in the fabrication of instruments that
have to be exquisitely crafted and at the same time rugged enough to withstand
the G-forces, vibration, and temperature extremes of a launch into space. The
silicon detectors of CRIS are the biggest and most sensitive yet for this kind
of instrument.
<P>&quot;Only one company in the world, Topsil, provides the kind of crystals we
need,&quot; Walton says. &quot;It's located in the village of Frederikssund on
the west coast of Denmark--a place so small that when five of us went to visit
the plant, the only taxi in town had to make two trips to carry us all from the
railroad station.&quot;
<P>Yu Wong, along with Julie Lee, headed the team that fabricated the detectors;
he explains that the silicon used in CRIS is doped with boron, which provides
negative acceptor sites in the crystal lattice. After the wafers are sliced from
a single crystal of silicon by a diamond saw, they are coated with lithium on
one side; with ultrasound cutters and chemical etching, grooves are cut around
the top edge of the wafer and a shallow &quot;well&quot; is created on the
bottom.
<P>Lithium is an &quot;interstitial donor&quot; to silicon; by heating the
wafers to 110 degrees Celsius and applying a positive 500-volt bias, the
positive lithium ions are made to drift into the bulk of the crystal,
positioning themselves among the silicon atoms instead of replacing them. They
pair with the negative boron acceptor sites and turn the entire wafer into what
Walton calls &quot;a big silicon diode,&quot; with a net electrical impurity
concentration of merely about one part in ten trillion.
<P>The completed detectors are measured for flatness to an accuracy of better
than one micrometer, calibrated using accelerated beams of argon and rigorously
tested for stability under high-vacuum conditions. The 60 finished wafers in the
CRIS experiment are the survivors of more than 160 candidates virtually
hand-made at Berkeley Lab.
<P>The ACE satellite is headed for a unique orbit around a gravitationally
stable libration point between the Earth and the sun that will keep it
operational for at least five years. As an example of the scope and sensitivity
of the CRIS experiment, it is anticipated that CRIS will collect some 100,000
iron nuclei (along with dozens of other species) during its first two years in
space, enough to precisely determine the abundance of even the rarest iron
isotope, iron 58, which probably accounts for only three tenths of one percent
of all the iron in ACE's outer-space environment.
<P>Berkeley Lab's Engineering Science Department staff, under the leadership of
Joe Jaklevic, have become specialists in supplying detectors capable of just
that kind of precision and endurance.
<P>Progress of the ACE satellite as it races towards its planned orbit can be
followed on the <A HREF="http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/ace/ace.html">ACE website.</A>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC7">Lab Scientists Win Five Out of Nine DOE Materials Sciences
Awards</A></H2>
<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>ach year the Department of Energy's Materials Sciences
Division awards three prizes in each of three categories: Materials Chemistry,
Solid State Physics, and Metallurgy and Ceramics. Thirteen DOE laboratories are
eligible to compete. This year, investigators in Berkeley Lab's own Materials
Sciences Division (MSD) took five of the nine awards.
<P>In Materials Chemistry, the Lab won two of the three awards. Alex Pines was
cited for Outstanding Scientific Accomplishment for his development of new
concepts and techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), such as double
rotation and dynamic-angle spinning for high-resolution imaging of solids, and
the application of these novel NMR methods to a wide range of materials research
problems.
<P>Paul Alivisatos won for Sustained Outstanding Research on the distinctive
properties of nanometer-scale assemblages of atoms. Alivisatos pioneered the
manufacture by chemical means of quantities of millions of individual atomic
clusters--assemblies ranging from 100 to 10,000 atoms in size--including such
compounds as gallium arsenide and other semiconducting nanoscale crystallites.
<P>In Solid State Physics, two of the three prizes also went to Berkeley Lab
researchers. Norman Phillips, who shared the award for Outstanding Scientific
Accomplishment with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory, confirmed that
the transition in the presence of magnetic fields to the superconducting state
in high-temperature superconductors of the cuprate type--not seen in normal
superconductors--is a thermodynamic first-order transition as some theorists had
speculated. Philips measured latent heat at the transition and found it to be
consistent with magnetization.
<P>Yuen-Ron Shen was recognized for Significant Implication for DOE-Related
Technologies for developing a general technique for studying surfaces and
interfaces by means of non-linear laser spectroscopy. So versatile is Shen's
technique that it can be used not only for solid structures but for liquid and
biological surfaces and interfaces, as well as for processes such as catalysis.
<P>In Metallurgy and Ceramics, the award for Outstanding Scientific
Accomplishment was won by Uli Dahmen for his discovery of the &quot;magic
size&quot; phenomenon that occurs among nanoscale inclusions of lead embedded in
a matrix of aluminum.(See Currents, Oct. 17.) Only sizes and shapes that
minimize strain energy can form, which helps explain the unique properties of
these inclusions (e.g., their very high melting points.)
<P>The DOE materials sciences awards are more than a pat on the back. &quot;The
prizes are worth almost $250,000 in equipment funds for the winners,&quot; says
Mark Alper, deputy head of MSD. That's material assistance indeed to the cause
of materials sciences at Berkeley Lab.<BR>

detoxification and bioremediation, with an emphasis upon removing selenium from
polluted waste streams.
<P>Marvin L. Cohen, a theoretical physicist with the Materials Sciences
Division, is University Professor at UC Berkeley. One of the most cited
condensed matter theorist of the last 30 years, Cohen developed the
pseudopotential model of electronic structure and has applied it to predicting
the properties of novel materials from first principles, including hard carbon
nitride, a material harder than diamond. His current interests include the
electronics of carbon-60 buckyballs and nanotubes.
<P>The AAAS was established in 1848 and has 140,000 members. It publishes the

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC12">FY 1998 Lab Directed R&amp;D Program Awards Announced</A></H2>
<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>erkeley Lab Director Charles Shank has announced the
selection of 66 projects for support by the Laboratory Directed Research and
Development (LDRD) Program for fiscal year 1998. A total of $8.8 million in both
operating expenses and capital equipment has been allocated for LDRD out of the
145 proposals requesting a total of $23.2 million that were submitted in
response to the Call for Proposals issued earlier this year. (See <I>Currents</I>,
March 7, 1997.) The proposals were evaluated in a review process that used the
scientific judgment and priorities of the division reviews and the Director's
Review Committee.
<P>Director Shank said: &quot;The LDRD program continues to be a primary means
of initial support for new, innovative ideas. The proposals for FY 1998
demonstrated a broad range of interesting scientific and technological research
and development possibilities.&quot; Computational proposals form an important
subset of funded proposals in all scientific divisions; a number of other
projects also apply Berkeley Lab's expertise at the Advanced Light Source and in
the Center for Environmental Biotechnology.
<P>In addition to cross-divisional and/or multi-investigator projects, a number
of individual investigator proposals were also funded. Some of the proposals
funded were VUV/soft x-ray synchrotron research for molecular environmental
science; genomic-scale gene identification approach to cell phenotype;
simulation and analysis for high energy and nuclear physics; laser driven
particle acceleration; studies toward a large-scale neutrino observatory;
investigations in boron neutron capture therapy; regional effects on global
climate changes; energy efficiency and demand in industry; and new detector
applications at the 88-Inch Cyclotron.
<P>Director Shank expressed his appreciation to all principal investigators who
submitted proposals for their effort and creativity.

<P><I>Energy Awareness Month</I>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC36">Lab Researchers Monitor Copiers to Cut Down Energy Waste</A></H2>
<B>By Antonia Reaves</B>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>o you know what equipment in your office uses the
most energy? If you guessed the copy machine, you are correct, according to
information from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Copiers vary widely
in the amount of power they draw, depending largely on copier speed. However,
most of the electrical consumption occurs when copiers are idle. The EPA
estimates that seven million copiers are currently in use in the U.S. and that
most of them remain idle for several hours each day.
<P>To cut down on such energy waste, in 1995 the EPA developed a new component
to its Energy Star Office Equipment program, which encourages copier
manufacturers to incorporate automated power management features into their new
machines. As a result, Energy Star copiers power down to an &quot;off&quot;
mode, drawing very low power after no activity has occurred for a specified
time. Energy Star copiers that fit the July 1, 1997 EPA criteria have additional
controls that step down the power first to a &quot;low-power&quot; mode after
only 15 minutes of no activity. The EPA estimates that these power management
features on Energy Star copiers could reduce annual electricity costs by 60
percent.
<P>Mary Ann Piette and Bruce Nordman, both researchers in the Environmental
Energy Technologies Division, have been funded by the EPA to evaluate the field
performance of Energy Star copiers. The EPA hopes to use the information to
further optimize savings.
<P>In order to measure the energy savings from Energy Star copiers, Nordman has
conducted nighttime audits to see whether Lab copiers are typically turned off
at night. After checking half of the copiers at the Lab, Nordman found that only
five percent of the non-Energy Star copiers were switched off; one-third were
fully on, and the remaining were in a &quot;power- saver&quot; mode. As
expected, the Energy Star copiers were all powered down to their &quot;off&quot;
mode, leading Nordman to conclude that &quot;Energy Star copiers do appear to be
saving energy.&quot;
<P>The next step in quantifying electricity savings will be to analyze data
collected from the detailed monitoring of six selected copiers at the
Laboratory.
<P>In addition to the overuse of electricity, copiers also consume a significant
amount of paper--two billion dollar's worth nationwide each year. According to
the EPA, it takes 10 times more energy to manufacture a piece of paper than to
copy an image onto it. Yet according to estimates, double-sided copies are only
made 26 percent of the time.
<P>To analyze what strategies might change this statistic, Nordman has been
measuring the use of double-sided copying at the Lab. So far, he noted that
Energy Star copiers whose default is double-sided copying have had that feature
disabled. On the other hand, he also found that &quot;just putting up signs
asking people to please make double-sided copies increased the double-sided to
single-sided copying ratio by eight percent.&quot;
<P>Another key issue Piette and Nordman have included in their research is user
satisfaction. Later this year they will survey employees both inside and outside
the Laboratory to better understand public perceptions and use of Energy Star
copiers.
<P>In the meantime, Lab employees can save thousands of dollars each year simply
by making double-sided instead of single-sided copies and by turning off copiers
when they are not needed.
<P>For more information on the research being conducted at the Lab, contact
Nordman at X7089 (BNordman@lbl.gov) or Piette at X6286 (MAPiette@lbl.gov). More
information on Energy Star copiers can be found on the web at <A
