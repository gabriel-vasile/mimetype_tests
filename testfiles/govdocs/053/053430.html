<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">We noted earlier that one of the principal changes
that occurred in the Maine MGF following the opening of the PFE was the
consolidation of the fleet around Portland between 1987 and today. </FONT>This
has been paralleled by a steady decline in the number of fishers engaged
in gillnetting for groundfish and, among those who continue to groundfish,
a decline in the amount of fishing effort individual fishers devote to
ground fishing. The smaller ports north and east of Portland are at once
more dependent on fishing for the overall health of the community and less
dependent specifically on ground fishing than fishers in and around Portland.
Most of the ports of the Down East region of Maine are physically isolated,
located along or at the ends of long dead end roads and more easily accessible
by water than by land. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Tourist infrastructures remain at incipient levels
of development, unlike the small coastal communities south of Portland,
and local economic alternatives remain confined to forestry and fishing
and the services that supply these industries and those employed in these
industries.</FONT> Generally, tourist infrastructure consists of a handful
of bed-and-breakfast establishments, a few restaurants, an art gallery
here and there, and one or two gift shops and book stores. Constraints
to developing tourism derive from ecological and cultural sources. Many
of these towns have been well integrated into local forest and rocky environments,
with little space available for developing tourism further without destroying
the very aesthetics that attract tourists to these coastal towns in the
first place. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Many long-time residents of coastal towns, particularly
those in the fishing industry, oppose tourism on the grounds that real
estate development competes with fishing for coastal access and increases
the volume of foot traffic along the waterfront.</FONT> Those who suggest
tourism as an alternative to commercial fishing, in any case, ignore several
features of tourist development. The just noted competition between commercial
and recreational uses of the coast predisposes commercial fishers against
moving into the leisure sector; indeed, established social ties to the
leisure sector, strengthened by the solidarity that has emerged from past
conflicts with commercial fishers, may prevent commercial fishers from
the support they require to establish tourist-related businesses. Further,
tourist development often quite rapidly begins duplicating services. Finally,
most of the jobs in tourism for those who do not own businesses are part-time
and low-wage jobs. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Most coastal Maine fishing communities are similar
in appearance. </FONT>They range in size from under 1,000 to around 5,000,
although most have populations of under 1,500. Stonington, for example,
has a population of around 700, at least 40 percent of whom are either
lobstermen or other kind of fishers (locals estimated a lobstering population
of 300), and most of the remaining year-round residents engaged in services
that cater to fishers. During the summer months, of course, populations
in most of these coastal towns increase with seasonal residents (Acheson
1987). Increases in summer time activity coincide with increased commercial
fishing and an increase in employment. Figures compiled by the Maine Department
of Labor, for example, find that unemployment rates in these regions drop
to their lowest levels, usually, during the months of July and August:

figures show us, first, that some of these coastal regions, particularly
those further from Portland (Jonesport and Machias) experience relatively
high rates of unemployment even during the summer months. </FONT>This indicates
the few alternative employment opportunities outside those tied to forestry
and fishing, both predominantly summertime operations. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Often hilly, neighborhoods of coastal Maine towns
consist of small frame homes, and very occasionally a trailer or two, interspersed
among colonial mansions and larger homes.</FONT> These neighborhoods seem
to slope down to the waterfronts, where the most dense clusters of businesses
and houses stand. Immediately upon entering a coastal town you perceive
fishing iconography: ancient wooden captains' steering wheels and capstans,
lobster pots, statues of lobsters and plaques with mounted cod outside
municipal offices. Nets, buoys, lobster traps and vessels clutter the yards
of nearly every house. Approaching the harbor, the orientation of the townfolk
toward water becomes especially obvious. Trap and net manufacturers, marine
supply stores, fishing cooperatives and marketing operations compete for
shoreline with whale-watching firms and transport vessels. Usually one
or more municipal piers or private docks extend out into the water, rigged
with fish and shellfish buying facilities that are barnlike in appearance.
Perpendicular to the main length of the pier are often smaller lengths
of floating piers for tying up the 14' to 20' crafts that fishers use to
move between land and their fishing vessels; the fishing vessels themselves
are moored, offshore, at moorings throughout the harbor. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The ports east and north of Ellsworth and Bar
Harbor, including Winter Harbor, Jonesport, and Machiasport, specialize
in lobster, sea urchins, and winter dragging for scallops; the infrastructure
is designed to land these species. </FONT>Vessels have been outfitted with
ironwork triangles to handle winches for hauling lobster traps or for the
scallop rigs. Sea urchins, a relatively new fishery, are harvested primarily
by divers, and a few gillnetters in each of these communities land flounder
and other groundfish during the summer. Their numbers are dwindling. Licensing
data becomes dated relatively quickly, even after three or four years;
the Maine Marine Patrolman based outside Ellsworth said, &quot;It [the
fishery] changes every year.&quot; <BR wp="br1">

beach of stone pebbles and a sheltered harbor where several of the lobstermen
store and launch their boats.</FONT> It is a deep water port that currently
aids the salmon farming and processing in town. A single factory operates
through most of the year, providing a low level of employment to the town.
There is little other industry beyond this. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">This port is dispersed and spread out, with smaller
boats that are trailered behind pick-up trucks and stored primarily at
the fishers' homes.</FONT> The pots are also stored at the homes of the
fishers, unlike the other ports, where pots are clustered at cooperatives
and fish dealers. Most of the fishing vessels are small, for targeting
lobster, generally under or around 45' in length. <BR wp="br1">

a fairly densely populated hamlet, with several sheltered facilities, including
a long jetty. We visited on a February day and counted 38 boats moored
out in the water, away from shore, between a large metal structure and

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Close to Acadia National Park, this community
contains much more tourism infrastructure than the other ports, yet it
was here that there was a recent controversy surrounding a whale watching
firm</FONT>: later, a Portland told us that in this case it was more of
an access issue, that there was much vehement opposition to the whale watching
coming in because they would take up too much of already precious harbor
space. Conflicts such as this, of course, would hinder an easy transition
into tourism. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Two fishers at a scallop/ lobster buying station
reported that there was only one fish dragger left in Southwest Harbor
and another in nearby Bar Harbor.</FONT> Both groundfish from medium sized
vessels. Most of the fishers here rely on summer lobstering and winter
scalloping. Scalloping season begins in November and runs through April;
lobstering begins in March or so, and runs through to November. Fishers
can catch lobster during the winter, but run the risk of having their traps
dragged up by scallopers. This prevents lobstering except in areas where
scallops will not drag because the substrates would damage their nets.
Dealers here reported that those fished for lobster during the winter time
placed traps on rocky ledges, where scallopers won't drag. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The vessels that do drag for fish around here
are not going as far as Georges Banks; they are more closer to shore draggers.
</FONT>The fisher interviewed here, as in other ports, told us that the
regulations had already dismantled much of the gillnetting portion of the
groundfish fleet, and they had switched to other fisheries. One of these,
of course, was sea urchins. In particular, lobstermen who used to rig their
boats with &quot;gallows,&quot; a rig that could make a lobster vessel
a dragger, now have gotten into diving (dry suits, mainly) for urchins.
They only drag for urchins where tides are too strong to dive, but this
is viewed as ecologically destructive. <BR wp="br1">

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Of all the ports visited between Machiasport and
Rockland, the most obvious gillnetter's harbor was Stonington. </FONT>In
Stonington live the past and current presidents of the Maine Gillnetters'
Association, and the port is home to Commercial Fisheries News, a monthly
publication dedicated to fishing issues. Its former editor is currently
the state Commissioner of Marine Fisheries. The port is a principal lobster
landing center with some scallopers, urchin divers, and ground fishers
who utilize gillnets. No big rollers with nets adorn boats in Stonington's
harbor, but several gillnets remain piled on a dock in the center of town.
Physically, Stonington sits at the end of a long dead-end road. The village
slopes downward to cradle the harbor. Three large piers--one a recently
built public pier for off-loading fish--jut out into the harbor and marine
related businesses cluster at the land ends of these docks. There are some
indications that the port has been shifting away from its emphasis on fishing,
yet without any clear direction as to what, exactly, will take fishing's
place. According to a local fisher, in recent years the port has lost a
hardware store, a clothing store, a drug store, and two welders, which
were replaced by two art galleries and two souvenir shops. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The groundfishers of Stonington have already suffered
severely from regulatory changes associated with Amendments # 5 and # 7,
as well as marine mammal legislation issues. </FONT>Changes talking place
over the past few years chronicle a fleet that has not only shrunk in size
but has struggled with alternative fisheries, attempting to move into the
already crowded lobster industry in particular as well as other fisheries
such as tuna and urchin diving. Before 1995, there were seven or eight
draggers operating in Stonington and another five operating in nearby Bar
Harbor, with upwards of 42 gillnetters between Stonington and Machiasport.
Over the past two seasons, however, these figures have fallen to one dragger
operating out of Stonington, along with 18 gillnetters. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Gillnetting for groundfish used to be primarily
a summertime activity, lasting from May to October and thus overlapping
with the lobster season. </FONT>Typically, the fishers would leave the
port in the evening, set their nets between midnight and 2:00 am, and pull
them up the following evening around the same time. They typically operated
from 30' to 40' vessels, using 3- to 4-man crews. As in Gloucester, crew
sizes have shrunk with the restrictions on times and areas, and crews now
are more likely to be 3 than 4. During the winter, gillnetters, traditionally,
would scallop or shrimp, but the bulk of their income came from groundfish.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">As in other ports, Stonington fishers are having
trouble recruiting crew who are willing to fish day in, day out, through
the heavy fishing season.</FONT> Only the lobster fishery is reproducing
itself at a healthy pace, with ground fishing crew working a few days at
a time and then laying off after being paid, unwilling to take the business
seriously because of negative perceptions concerning its future. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Marketing of fish is conducted at the municipal
pier, but is dominated by two men, one who buys and another who trucks
the catch to more distant markets.</FONT> According to a local fisher's
wife, all of the fish landed in Stonington is trucked to Nagel's Seafood
in Boston. Because of infrastructure limitations--the dead-end road mentioned
earlier--locals view marketing as a primary problem. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In adjusting to changes, fishers have moved into
the winter urchin fishery as well as experimented with other fisheries.
</FONT>There are few alternative occupations in a place like Stonington
outside of fishing, and the retraining center established there has toyed
with aquaculture and other alternatives without much success. Because of
concerns about crowding in the lobster industry, groundfishers fear that
they will not have the history to enter the lobster industry, especially
given recent zoning proposals before Maine lobstermen. This model, currently
being considered for the lobster industry, may well serve as a model for
community based fishery management in other fisheries (James A. Wilson
-- Univ. of Maine, personal communication). It consists of the following:
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">First, Maine recognizes regional distinctions
between fisheries in state waters based on historical and ecological characteristics.
</FONT>These regions reflect groups of fishers who are similarly placed
with regard to their interactions with the marine resources. That is, they
practice similar mixes of gears and target species and have, historically,
interacted with fishers from other communities within the zones, to define,
protect, and defend their territories (Acheson 1987).</LI>

<P><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">Maine recognizes five zones. </FONT>Each of these
zones has its own regional council who are elected for three-year, staggered
terms through a process that involves: a) identifying stakeholders with
current licensing data; b) voting in annual elections. The number of council
members varies by the size of the zone, with council members representing
100 or fewer license holders.</LI>

<P><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">Each regional council develops proposals for
changes in fishing rules which are then voted on by all fishers in the
zone</FONT>. Changing any fishing rule requires that two-thirds of region's
fishers agree on the change. Rules that are decided upon by regional councils
include those governing numbers and types of gear and time regulations
(seasons, numbers of days one can fish, etc.). The zone model allows for
sub-zones to exist within zones for finer regulations that recognize more
localized circumstances.</LI>

<P><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">Perhaps most important, the Maine model is one
of participatory co-management, with state entities</FONT>--specifically,
the Marine Fisheries Commission and the Department of Marine Resources--and
fishing interests coming together to develop proposals for changes in fishing
regulations. This consists, essentially, of a &quot;bottom-up&quot; meets
&quot;top-down&quot; model in which lines of communication between the
state and fishing groups, and among fishing groups, have become institutionalized.<BR>
<BR>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">Fishers can fish in more than one zone, but must
abide by the most restrictive zone's regulations. </FONT>This solves problems

establishment of zones and regional councils is an indication that entry
into the lobstering industry, historically highly territorial, will be
even more difficult in the future. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Despite its seemingly ideal location between the
southern coast of Maine and Gloucester, Portsmouth is neither a large MGF
port nor a great center of commercial fishing activity.</FONT> Much of
the city's commercial fishing activity is based across the river from Portsmouth,
in Kittery, Maine, and consists primarily of lobster vessels. Development
in Portsmouth has emphasized commercial uses of the port that do not necessarily
involve commercial fishing, including shipbuilding and international trade.
Along its waterfront are several restaurants and historic monuments that
reveal a recent emphasis on tourism--particularly heritage tourism--but
a large commercial fleet with active off-loading facilities is not prominent
in these activities. Our efforts to survey seafood dealers and processors
in Portsmouth about groundfishing met with little interest and less success,
indicating that the MGF has no substantial presence there. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Portsmouth and the ports between Portland and
Portsmouth, along the southern coast of Maine, are more obviously centers

such as Ogunquit and Kennebunkport still maintain their lobster fleets
as essential to their character, but those few groundfishers who moor their
vessels among the smaller vessels land their fish primarily in Portland,
at the display auction, as was discussed in detail in the section on Portland.

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Provincetown (known by locals as &quot;P'Town&quot;)
is a historic port with the second deepest harbor in the United States.
</FONT>Unlike Point Judith, the fishing fleet of P'Town has concentrated
its efforts on dragging, and has not significantly diversified into other
fisheries. The majority of the fleet are eastern otter trawlers, complemented
by a small fleet of inshore angling vessels. A total of 18 vessels were
counted at the docks, with their numbers equally divided between steel
and wooden hull vessels. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The importance of fishing to historic P'Town is
reflected in murals in the town hall showing fishers bringing in the catch.
</FONT>Provincetown once had a booming fleet that took advantage of its
proximity to local fishing grounds to catch large quantities of groundfish.
Fish were processed and shipped to Boston and other markets, and a thriving
processing sector dominated the local docks. About 15 years ago, local
respondents report that the industry began to experience a downturn as
nearby fish stocks were depleted and area closures such as Stellwagen Bank
limited the opportunities to fish near shore. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Another disadvantage of P'Town is its geographic
location. </FONT>Although it has the second deepest natural harbor in the
world, being at the northernmost tip of Cape Cod, its distance from major
fish markets has made it difficult to compete with ports having better
access to ground transportation such as New Bedford and Gloucester. In
the summer time, the one road going into an out of P'Town on Cape Cod is
regularly clogged with tourist vehicles on their way to visiting the beaches
or traveling to the art and tourists shops that have come to dominant the
P'Town economic landscape. In the winter time, bad storms can close down
the one road making regular access difficult. Processing plants closed
down and the traditional fishing fleet aged while gentrification drove
the economy towards tourism: <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Original fishers of P'Town were English and Scottish
immigrants, eventually replaced by Portuguese immigrants who came to dominate
the fishing industry.</FONT> Extended Portuguese families worked in occupational
enclaves based on 6-7 person crews. They didn't significantly diversify
their economic activities and thus remained somewhat culturally and linguistically
isolated from other residents. Migration between P'Town and Portugal, as
with the fishers in New Bedford, was common. Many of the more successful
fishers left P'Town over the last 25 years to join the fleet in New Bedford.
They were replaced by newer immigrants who would take over aging vessels
and &quot;have a go at it.&quot; However, others stayed and have fished
out of P'Town for up to 40 years (key respondent, elder fisher). Because
of the outmigration of highliners, and the ethnic insularity of the fleet,
there was really no impetus (or significant capital) to diversify fishing
strategies (key respondent). Those coming into the fishery took up with
what was available, and had little motivation to change. <BR wp="br1">

are two fish suppliers: Oceanic Seafood and Whaling City Seafoods. The
docks are in good condition, and the Chamber of Commerce has been actively
promoting the quality of the harbor for berthing of large offshore (foreign)
vessels. The end of the pier is dominated by restaurants and local shops,
but there is little evidence of businesses dependent on the fishing industry.

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Provincetown has the most dilapidated fleet of
any MGF port.</FONT> Most of the vessels observed (13 out of 18) were old
eastern rigged otter trawlers. Half of the fleet were of wood construction,
while the other half consisted of rusty steel vessels. The fleet is a combination
of scallopers and otter trawls ranging from 45 to 68 feet in length. The
otter trawlers have from 2-6 crew, while the scallopers have crews up to
seven (NMFS regulations prohibit more than seven crew members on scallopers).
The isolation of Provincetown insures that all fishing families live in
local residences. Some of these families are having difficulties with their
mortgages as they struggle to survive in the fishery. As in New Bedford,
some of those in economic stress have returned to Portugal. The condition
of the fleet is summed up by a welder who has worked on them for many years:

have been refloated and reused if not sold outright. Of 28 draggers/scalloper
vessels on the Harbor Master list, three have been sold and one is up for
sale. Because fishing has been so poor, and regulations so restrictive,
fishers can only afford to fix the most pressing repairs, ignoring others
which could be life-threatening on an extended fishing expedition. The
condition of the fleet has thus cut into the trawl time of the more problematic
vessels. Captains are afraid to venture far from shore for extended periods
because of the threat of sinking. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Newport is a historical port dedicated to tourism
and recreational boating but with a long and persistent commercial fishing
presence. </FONT>Before the development of the docking facilities at Point
Judith, Newport was the center for fishing and shipping in the state. In
1971, 57 percent of all Rhode Island commercial fisheries landings were
in Newport, but Point Judith surpassed Newport in importance by 1973, and
now is the dominant commercial port in the state. <BR wp="br1">

</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Tourism in Newport started as far back as the
1700s</FONT>. Visitors included southern plantation owners who stayed in
Newport to escape the heat of the summer. By the 1830s, tourist hotels
began to dominate the shore side landscape. The famous &quot;cottages&quot;
of Newport where built by industrialists seeking to outdo each other in
displays of ostentatiousness. The present tourist economy is centered on
year round activities with the highlights being summer and sailing events.
The Americas Cup races are regularly held in the area, attesting to the
importance of the pleasure boating industry. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Besides tourism, the East Bay Navy base has a

Newport for retirement. They bring money into the community as retirement
pensions and contribute to the support of many service-oriented businesses
as significant consumers. <BR wp="br1">

It does not make much sense to talk of the degree of community &quot;dependency&quot;
on fishing in Newport, for the existing 'community' could do quite well
if commercial fishing disappeared altogether. A different perspective is
to think of the fishing &quot;community&quot; as a regional contributor
to the commerce of the groundfish fishery, and as a means of providing
support to approximately 200 families with a sustainable livelihood while
they contribute a high-quality food product to the commerce of the region
and nation. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">During the 1700s to early 1800s, fishing was an
important part of the local economy.</FONT> Historical records mention
fish drying stations and fisheries. The quantities of fish are not mentioned,

of Newport as a slave trading and shipping center. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Whaling was practiced for several decades in the
1770s, but was never as important as it was in ports such as New Bedford

However, by the late 1850s, most of the craft had either moved to New Bedford
or entered other pursuits (Field 1902: 482-483). <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The period from 1800 to 1930 saw the development
of the indigenous (bay and inshore) fleet.</FONT> Fishing effort was concentrated
on groundfish stocks that could be reached in a day, fished, and then landed
on the dock. Most fish, with the exception of menhaden, were taken in staked
and floating fish traps and weirs. This was also the period when industrial
fish was a major component of the economy. For example, in 1889 in Newport
and other Rhode Island ports, fish reduction plants for menhaden, and fish
drying operations for cod and other groundfish processed 127 million pounds
of fish, 89 percent of which were menhaden (Olsen and Stevenson 1975:53).
This fishery collapsed in the 1930s, and the fishery transitioned towards
groundfish trawling. During the 1920s, marine diesel engines effectively
extended the range and fishing time of commercial groundfishing vessels
using otter trawls. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Newport has one of the best natural harbors on
the Northeast.</FONT> It provides excellent protection from rough weather,
and is deep enough to provide berthing for US naval vessels. There is only
one wharf area that is presently used by fishers. It is leased by the state
to the Newport Shipyard Company. This stone filled wharf is adequate to
service the 20 vessels that regularly land groundfish in Newport. In 1981,
major fish buyers included Anthony's Seafood, Aquidnick Lobster Company,
and Parascandolo and Sons. Anthony's is no longer in business, and Parascandolo
markets all groundfish landings that come into Newport. Fish are not sold
or processed locally, but ice packed in trucks to Boston, New York, New
Bedford, and markets south. Decisions are made on where to ship the fish
based on equitable pricing and demand. Ice is supplied to these firms by
the Eastern Ice Company located in Newport. The Tallman and Mack Company,
a private firm reported by Bort (1981) to operate fish traps between April
and November out of Newport, is no longer in business. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Newport's groundfish fleet has dramatically declined
over the last twenty years.</FONT> The decline has been spurred by increasing
property values restricting fishing industry infrastructure and competition
with recreational vessels constricting wharf space. No new boats or new
shore side fishing businesses have come into the fishery in the last twenty
years. The local waters of Narragansett Bay are overfished, and nearshore
grounds off the coast and nearby Block Island have experienced significant
declines in groundfish. Factors forcing a decline in groundfishing are
not recent, but has been ongoing for some time. In 1981, Bort writes: <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">&quot;<I>The general direction of the community's
development does not bode well for the future of fishing.</I></FONT><I>
Neither tourists nor pleasure boaters are typically enthusiastic about
sharing a harbor with commercial fishermen. The stereotypic grizzled old
man handlining from a dory is romanticized. The modern steel trawler is
viewed as a source of odor and noise and as competition for space. The
fishing industry is far down on the list of economic inputs to Newport,
and probably also on the community's list of priorities</I>&quot; (1981:89-90).
<BR wp="br1">

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Bort was correct in this prediction. </FONT>There
is still a degree of prejudice by the Newport community against commercial
fishers (key respondent, Office of the Harbor Master), and the fleet has
declined dramatically. In 1977, 164 boats made landings in Newport. Of
these 49 were from Newport, 45 from New Bedford, and the remainder from
as far north as Gloucester and as far south as Virginia (William Murphy,
National Marine Fisheries Service , Newport, RI). In 1978, only 91 of these
vessels had returned to Newport. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In 1996, the number of MGF permits held by Newport
commercial vessels was 16, with a total of only 20 vessels landing groundfish
in the port. Of these, only 2 fished in the bay, and another 2 fished in
nearshore waters, with the remainder fishing 7-10 day trips on grounds
north and south of Rhode Island.</FONT> Using the 1981 figure of 91 vessels
as a benchmark, this represents a 78% decline in commercial fishing vessels
landing in Newport over a fifteen year period. Similar declines have been
reported in Gloucester and New Bedford. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The greatest decline has been in the indigenous,
or bay and inshore fleet. </FONT>After WWII, the indigenous Newport fleet
consisted of 20 vessels. In 1981, this number was down to only eight, and
in 1996, only four. Declines in nearshore stocks, pollution impacts, competition
with stationary gear, and area closures have made inshore groundfishing
more difficult. Overall, the Newport fleet is more dependent proportionately
on groundfish than the more diversified fleet fishing out of Point Judith.
All of the vessels are essentially groundfish fishing, with some having
the capacity and permits to fish squid <I>(Loligo) </I>as needed in order
to maximize the benefit of days at sea limits. <BR wp="br1">

15 workers in the plant and 4. The operation uses twelve 18-wheelers plus
five straight bed trucks. The total number of groudfish fishers and immediate
support personnel comes to approximately 100 individuals and their families.
This is comparable with the estimated numbers and fleet size for Montauk,
NY, which had 24 vessels in operation and an estimated 100 families dependent
on the industry. Unlike Montauk, with 76 MGF permits in port, there is
a close match in Newport between the number of MGF permits (16) and the
number of vessels that land groundfish at the port (20). <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Even though Montauk ranks third in overall number
of ground fishing permits today, in 1991 it did not even register in the
top 25 ports in number of permits.</FONT> This is a reflection of the purchase*
of permits in the years after 1991 to insure access to the fishery. It
also indicates how counting registered fishing permits is not a good indicator
of the number of commercial vessels in a port, nor necessarily of catch
effort*. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>*Note by Clay: NMFS calculations of current and past effort
rely on landings data rather than permit data. Permit data are sometimes
used in conjunction with landings data in order to estimate latent effort
-- effort which could move into the fishery in the future if conditions
changed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">As of 1995, there were forty reported commercial
vessels in Montauk</FONT> (Drumm 1995). However, the according to a Coast
Guard office and field counts of vessels, the functional ground fishing
fleet consists of only 24 vessels, not 40 as reported by Drumm (1995).
A 1996 NMFS permit file puts the number of commercial vessels counting
Montauk as their port city* at 76. This includes all types of commercial
MGF permits. Of these, 46 count Montauk as their home city, 27 other New
York cities and towns while three reside in other states, including New
Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida. However, the total number of groundfish
permits held is 132. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In February, a total of 18 of the commercial fleet
of medium to large scale vessels ranging from 32 to 90 feet were counted
at the dock in February, and another six reported out fishing.</FONT> All
commercial vessels observed were trawlers with the exception of two lobster
vessels. Party boats, tuna head boats*, and whale watching boats dominated
the drydock area. <BR wp="br1">

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Note by Clay: &quot;Head boat&quot; is another term for
party boat, trips where the payment is per person (per head) rather than
a charter of the vessel by a single group or individual.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Fishing <I>effort</I> off Montauk and on commercial
stocks targeted by Montauk fishers (e.g., <I>Loligo</I>) is increasing
somewhat from migration of vessels from other ports since the closure of
portions of the Georges Bank. </FONT>This has caused some concern and conflict
between local fishers and these &quot;outsiders&quot; (key respondents--two
commercial fisher, and Drumm 1995). A key respondent reported that the
large boats from the New England fishery now fishing out of Ocean City,
Maryland are directly competing with the Montauk fleet for whiting, squid
and other species. <BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">There has been a transition from commercial to
charter boat/recreational fishing with the decline of local fishery stocks.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">A major concern and source of potential conflict
is the competition between the stabilized commercial fleet and an expanding
recreational sector. </FONT>The sportfishing industry on Long Island contributes
about $1.1 billion to the economy, while commercial fishing contributes
a yearly average $54 million in seafood for public consumption. There are
an estimated 174,000 saltwater fishing households on Long Island, and within
the three mile limit, recreational catches of fluke, bluefish and scup
regularly exceed harvests by commercial fishers (Fagin 1994). Recent state
laws include a series of bills that ban trawling near Long Island inlets
and some other prime fishing areas. The prime purpose of the law is not
to conserve fish but &quot;<I>to help marina operators, bait shop owners
and others by making more fish available for sport fishermen</I>&quot;
(Fagin 1994:A51). <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Commercial fishers are also concerned over the
level of pollution in nearshore waters. </FONT>Algal blooms, including
&quot;red tide,&quot; have wreaked havoc with bay waters and shellfish.
In 1994, concerns centered around dioxin pollution and other pollutants
which were forcing fishers offshore. A song written by Billy Joel (&quot;The
Downeaster Alexa&quot;) describes how Montauk fishers have to travel farther
and farther off shore to make a catch because of environmental problems
(Swift 1994). <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Avoiding pollution and abiding by nearshore restrictions
means longer trips at greater distances offshore. </FONT>Fishing farther
offshore has increased risk for those who traditionally fished the Sound,
and two local baymen died at sea in 1993 while fishing far from shore.
Traditional fishing cycles of 2-4 days were tied into &quot;making market.&quot;
With trip lengths increasing to 5 days or more, including greater transit
distance and costs to reach the grounds, it has made earning an income
more unpredictable. A local crewman explains: <I>&quot;We have to fish
with the cycles - when markets open up to buy fish--if we can't do this
it makes it difficult to make a living - your income becomes very erratic.&quot;</I>
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In response to such events and economic concerns
over fishing families, the Montauk Emergency Fishermen's Fund was initiated
in 1993. </FONT>The purpose of this fund is &quot;to take care of fishermen
and their immediate families who experience loss of life at sea, medical
hardship, or severe economic hardship&quot; (Fund president). <BR wp="br1">

</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Communication with management was expressed as
a lack of understanding of what fishers and fishing was all about. Interviews
with local commercial fishers indicated a frustration with the management
process, and that fishers felt their concerns were ignored even when they
did have a chance to speak: </FONT><BR wp="br1">

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Given the isolation of Montauk, with few options
other than marine resource utilization, this community is highly dependent
on sustaining its commercial fishing enterprise.</FONT> As in other secondary
ports in this study, the commercial groundfish fishing sector in Montauk
does not appear to be expanding, nor does it appear to be reproducing itself
through replacement of old vessels with new, increased processing capacity,
or increasing social yield (the number of fishers who sustainably participate).
Declines in all of these areas are being hastened by the growth of the
recreational sector, increasing fishing costs, pollution impacts on stocks,
and regulatory restrictions. Yet, the expansion of fishers into new fisheries
such as tilefish, and switching to tuna fishing and other strategies (e.g.,
whale watching) has given the commercial fishing community more flexibility
than in larger ports such as Gloucester. <BR wp="br1">

</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Situated at the southeastern tip of New Jersey,
at the mouth of Delaware Bay, Cape May has long been a departure and arrival
point for the well-traveled Cape May, NJ to Lewes, DE ferry, a transportation
link between the cities of the north and the Delmarva Peninsula.</FONT>
Among nearby cities to the south is Ocean City, Maryland's premier tourist
destination and a common destination for tourists from Washington, DC,
and other nearby metropolitan areas. In both areas, tourism dominates the
economic activity and the commercial fishing fleets are, on the one hand,
appendages to the tourist sectors and, on the other, economic activities
that have been marginalized by the tourist sector. Fishers in both locations
have experienced the encroaching effects of coastal gentrification and
real estate development, although portions of the fleet in Cape May have
situated themselves within the tourist trade in a way similar to Chatham
fishers, becoming tourist attractions themselves and providing fresh fish
to local markets and restaurants. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In Ocean City, the commercial fleet ties up at
a small sheltered harbor south of the boardwalk and other attractions of
the tourist trade. </FONT>As noted elsewhere in this report, the fleet
seems more marginalized than the fleet in Cape May, a portion of which
has been well integrated into the tourist industry. McCay, et al. (1993)
said this about Ocean City, lending support to the notion that the fleet
is becoming more marginalized over time: &quot;Ocean City residents are
begrudgingly tolerant of the commercial fishing industry. The commercial
docks are located between a business and residential section. Residents
are making sure the commercial businesses and boats stick to the letter
of the [zoning] law. Also, landside access to the harbor area is limited
in that there is only one street on which a tractor trailer can drive.
In the past gear was stored on property that was zoned residential but
this practice has been eliminated. Some very expensive homes have been
built close to the harbor area and these owners do not like the sight of
the gear.&quot; <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Ocean City's fleet is primarily a small- to medium-sized
vessel fleet, operating as day vessels and fishing often in Maryland state
waters for blue crab, particularly behind the barrier islands.</FONT> Cape
May's fleet is larger and more diverse than Ocean City's, fishing with
draggers, lobster pots, gillnets, and black sea bass pots. In 1993, McCay,
et al. (1993: 76) reported that squid was becoming the most important species
in Cape May, that there were 33 local draggers and 57 transient vessels.
The fleet supplies fish to a bustling seafood processing sector at four
primary locations around the city, creating shore-side employment for over
200 individuals, some of whom are contracted for work from as far away
as Philadelphia. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Observing transient vessels is not less common
in Ocean City.</FONT> Perhaps the most significant attribute of the Cape
May and Ocean City ports is their status as ports for transient boats from
the north and south. During our visits, we saw shrimp vessels from North
Carolina, Mississippi, and Norfolk in these ports, alongside local vessels.
The central locations of Cape May and Ocean City in terms of northern and
southern fisheries, combined with an increase in transience among fishers
in general as crises develop in one fishery after another, is likely to
increase the importance of these ports in the future. <BR wp="br1">

</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">At this, the southern range of the ground fishing
fleet, fishers who are native to the area have developed a multi-species,
multi-gear, highly flexible fishing strategy that relies on state and federal
waters and includes the commercial exploitation of several species.</FONT>
Unlike the fleet based in the Gulf of Maine, the winter season along North
Carolina's Outer Banks and the mouth of the Chesapeake is a heavy sink
net fishing season, when commercial fishers target weakfish, various basses,
flounder, monkfish bycatch, and dogfish. During this season, as well, fishers
from several ports in the northeast also land fish at the fish houses of
Wanchese, North Carolina and the two Virginia ports of Hampton Roads and
Newport News. During a visit in March 1996, we encountered three New Bedford-based
fishers off-loading monkfish and monkfish livers from a 40' craft at one
of the principal seafood dealers in Wanchese, and in Portland we listened
while fishers related stories of wintering off North Carolina's coast,
as much to escape the chilling Gulf of Maine winter as to catch and land
fish. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In part because fishers in this region depend
nearly as much on fishing in state waters as fishing in federal waters,
those we interviewed seemed less disturbed by federal regulations than
fishers in other ports. </FONT>At the same time, Eastern Dare/Outer Banks
fishers were less concerned (although not entirely unconcerned) about water
quality issues than fishers in the other four regions. They expressed some
concern over the navigational difficulties surrounding Oregon Inlet, but
were far less inclined to bring up the issues of hog waste, mining, or
forestry than other fishers we interviewed. Because of problems with Oregon
Inlet, many seafood dealers have moved their marketing and processing operations
from Wanchese to the Newport News/Hampton Roads region, both expanding
their seafood buying capabilities and creating more integrated linkages
between the two landing centers. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Based on visits to the area and interviews primarily
with seafood dealers, there are around 80 to 100 trawlers in the 60' to
100' range that land fish in the Hampton/Newport News area, although not
all of these are local vessels.</FONT> These fish for flounder--known throuout
the Northeast as &quot;fluke&quot;--in the winter time and scallop in the
summer. An important bycatch of the scallop fishery in this region are
monkfish. Seafood dealers interviewed ranged from the belief that changing
regulations would affect no fisher to believing they would have negative
impacts on around half of the fleet, with 25 percent moving into other
fisheries and 25 percent, primarily the larger vessels, going out of business.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Local fishers felt that New England fishers had
been infringing upon their fishing territories and water since before Amendment
# 5, and Amendment # 7 has exacerbated this.</FONT> Fishers operating out
of the mouth of the Chesapeake expressed deepest concerns, among all the
fishing issues, over problems with the quota systems for summer flounder.
Fishing &quot;inside&quot; or in state waters for summer flounder has long
been a central part of North Carolina and Virginia fishers, and they have,
historically, supplemented these catches with summer flounder caught in
federal waters. Quotas for summer flounder have caused them to shift from
summer flounder to mackerel and dogfish, as well as move into the squid
fisheries that are more popular along the New Jersey shore. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Some fishers we interviewed cited a decrease in
wintertime fishing opportunities--related, in part, to recent decline in
oyster stocks--saying that this has led to increases in summertime fisheries,
particularly crabbing in inside waters.</FONT> As fishers come into the
Pamlico and Currituck Sounds, they encounter crowding problems associated
with the trap fisheries of North Carolina's Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine
System. Similar difficulties face crabbers in the Chesapeake, who have
historically defined and defended territories. Thus, moving into inland
waters is only a partial solution for fishers in this region. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Two factors influence the behaviors of fishers
in this region: that they switch between federal and state waters and hence
depend on several gears and species through the year, and that they rely
heavily on nets.</FONT> The former predisposes fishers in this region to
object to some of the federal quota systems and to view competition from
fishers from other states as problematic; the latter makes them more sensitive
to those regulations affecting nets, particularly Florida's net ban (which
has caused an increase in Florida net fishers fishing in North Carolina
waters or the federal waters near North Carolina), mandated modifications
to nets because of turtles or bycatch issues, and mesh size regulations.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Fishers along the Outer Banks and from Wanchese
are especially sensitive to the historical importance of their fisheries
and related marine lifestyles, beginning with the shore-based whaling fisheries
of the early colonial period and going through subsequent periods where
fishing families provided life-saving services to hundreds of ships that
make up the &quot;Ghost Fleet&quot; of the Outer Banks.</FONT> Fishers
we interviewed here mentioned the importance of this history in terms of
the memories of old fishers. One claimed, for example, that there have
been periods in local fishers' pasts that they had to migrate to Florida
because of declines in local fish stocks, making the argument that regulations
need to consider extreme fluctuations in fish stocks as part of the economic
hazards of commercial fishing. This same fishers noted the importance of
life-time experience in fishing and of the difference between knowledge
gained through direct experience and knowledge gained through scientific
methods; the latter, of course, may suffer from sampling biases, while
the former may suffer from other kinds of biases (economic, political,
religious, etc.), yet combining the two could far better inform the regulatory
community than sole reliance on one or the other. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The heavy dependence on Wanchese as a fishing
community demands special attention in this section. </FONT>Seven principal
families of seafood dealers ring the seafood industrial park and serve
as the central locations of the estimated 200 fishing families who live
in Wanchese as well as anchor the southern marketing behaviors of fishers
from as far away as New Bedford, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine. The
fleets that originate from here, and the fishing activity focused by the
seafood dealers and the ports, concentrate around the seafood industrial
park and fleets of trawlers organized or encouraged by seafood dealers.
The large, &gt;100' vessels, as is occurring elsewhere, have been less
active recently, their captains and crews now fishing from smaller crafts.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">These arrangements have been replicated in the
NewportNews/Hampton area.</FONT> As one leaves either Wanchese or migrates
across the Chesapeake, to Virginia's Eastern Shore and the other parts
of the Delmarva Peninsula, more independent, owner-operator fishing operations
prevail, with some long-time loyalties between fishers and fish dealers
that hinge on the questions of slip space and access. In recent years,
fishers in this region have become increasingly concerned that real estate
development will entice dealers to sell their space to developers less
interested in commercial fishing than in providing marinas and condominiums
for recreational boating traffic. </P>
