July 2- July 8<br /><br />
By Graham and Jay
</strong></font></div>

<p>Sunday:  AHHHH a nice relaxing day to do nothing (well sort of). Many of the rocking Ames Academy members found themeselves doing laundry, but those too cool for laundry headed over to the golf course to watch some NASCAR. Four left for the course, but only two came back as Jay and Steve found themselves glued to the TV both getting in touch with their inner redneck. Apres laundry and NASCAR the hungry and ambitious Academyites decided to cook dinner for themselves. Burgers and Dogs were the prime entrees on the menu for the evening, but a fire needed to be started first. Showing their incredible "Me...man...have made fire" (Tom Hanks - Castaway) skills Jon, Marc, Brandon, and Jay turned the deck of the Ames lodge into Mount Burgerburner, the newly formed volcano in Mountain View California. After crispy burgers and chardogs the group held a meeting for the purpose of discussing the group's summer project. At this meeting the project proposals were cut to two, High Altitude Spore Collection and Arctic Instrument Deployment. </p>

<p>After a very productive meeting the group decided they needed a break for the night. Some retired to rooms to write up individual summer project proposals, and others continued the procrastination with a trip to the movies. Live Free or Die Hard was the film of choice. After a slow clap in the theater to get the movie started, the Academyites were left wondering how Bruce Willis destroyed a helicopter with a car.</p>


<p>Monday:  What can be said about this day… it was a Monday.  We woke up early, as usual, and had our Mega Bites!  Monday became a long day at work for some and a relaxed day for others.  The primary focus of this day was the first RAP session, hosted by Goose and the beautiful Yvonne Torres.  During this session, we all had a chance to sign Graham's new.  </p>

<p>After the RAP session the gang assembled in 209A for another birthday party. HAPPY BIRTHDAY RICK! </p>

<p>Tuesday:  Ghostrider this is Mustang...it is 7:20 AM and you are cleared for landing at MegaBites. After breakfast the studious students headed off to work with their PIs for the 5th time. Tuesday was a pretty 'normal' day if such a thing exists in Silicon Valley. At 6 PM the Academy piled into the vans and drove to Morgan Hills to meet the famous Doug and Kristy O'Handley!  Good food, conversation, a beautiful pool, and a cute little poodle had the group wishing they didn't have to leave by 9 PM. However sleep on this evening was very important b/c the departure for Lake Tahoe was the following morning at 6 AM.</p>

<p>Wednesday:  Wake up and smell the coffee!  We had an early departure for Tahoe this fine day.  The trip was exciting for some and a snooze for others.  Although the Party Barge left first, it was the Rocket Van which first arrived at the Condo de O'Handley.  Lake Tahoe is truly beautiful, but we can all agree that we've been in warmer waters.  Wednesday became a great day for the pool.  Most of us swam, played, and laid out by the pool for quite a while.  Upon returning to Doug's place, we met Academy alum Graylan Vincent, a fine new friend for the '07 Academy.</p>

Wednesday evening began with a trip to the Zimmerman's for some drinks and cheese.  Bob and Helene are awesome hosts. </p>

<p>The girls made Wednesday evening's dinner.  A fantabulous spaghetti meal.  Nothing follows up a spaghetti dinner like jumping into Lake Tahoe in a relaxed state of mind.</p>

<p>Thursday:  Good Morning San Francisco....errr I mean Lake Tahoe. Its 8 AM and time to head over to Nevada to visit the Desert Research Institute (DRI).  After collecting their thoughts the Academyites loaded up the vans and drove from Lake Tahoe over to Reno Nevada to visit DRI. It just so happens that July 5th, 2007 was forecast to be the hottest day ever on record in Reno - 109 degrees Fahrenheit. Upon arrival our Lockheed Safety Engineer John found two lizards and a baby rabbit hopping around the lawn. Hot weather, cute little animals, whats next? Virtual reality in a CAVE or Antarctic brine culturing? Actually all of the above, but only as a prelude to patronizing the great state of Nevada. On the ride back from Reno Steve decided to break the A/C in his van to test the will of the Academyites. He said it wasn't his fault but we all saw him in the parking lot with a hammer under the hood. </p>

<p>After the bakeout...I mean ride back from Reno the guys went to work on a special meal for the lovely ladies of the Ames Academy. Working hard in the kitchen and spending every penny the gentlemen prepared a candlelit dinner which was presented to the dames with the help of Bob James and Yanni. Fresh Fruit with a sweetened vanilla pudding dip, Salad, Rice Pilaf, Chicken Kabobs with fresh veggies, and yes even homemade french crepes...what a meal. Hats off to Graham and Marc for their extraordinary efforts in preparing the food, and welcome again to our hosts/guests Bob and Helene Zimmerman, and Graylan (Ames Academy - 2003).</p>

<p>Friday:  Truckee Rafting!!!  John and Mrs. Hinds joined us for this amazingly fun trip on the lazy river.  The trip got off to a crazy start when the rafting company didn't have our reservations, but all turned out well and we were in the water almost before we had time to laugh at that guy who spilled his cooler. </p> 

<p>Nothing like a good battle over the water to make you laugh.  We had a day full of wet and wild fun.  Who can forget John finally getting tossed in the water (though a missing sandal made for a bit of a delay).  I think a few of us can agree the high point of the day was Graylan the Crocodile emerging from the brush in search of his prey.  Kathleen had her battle wound, Graham had his hurt elbow, and Gaylan had a red belly from sliding across a bunch of tall grass, but we all survived the onslaught of rapids on this killer river that some small children call The Beast (okay, it was a pretty relaxed river, but we can all tell everyone else that we braved the worst).</p>

<p>We had a great group meeting this day.  Our group has become close and functional pretty quickly.  </p>

<p>Friday evening became a lavish dinner at Jake's.  Sitting on the deck overlooking Lake Tahoe and eating some of the finest food Tahoe has to offer made for quite an evening.  The hula pie was absolutely delicious though so big that it put a hurt-piece on all (only Jenni and Erin proved they've got what it takes).  Leave it to Jay Carroll and Bob Zimmerman to spot the most expensive car some in our group may ever see.  But don't worry gang, Graham will let you borrow the Ferrari sometime.</p>

<p>Friday night became a great night for stargazing on the dock by Tahoe.  Although the telescope we had was out of calibration and a bit too out of shape to resolve anything anyway, we still had a grand time observing the heavens above.  What a perfect way to end any night.</p>


<p>Saturday:  Last Day in Tahoe so we're just going to hang around the lodge right? WRONG! Saturday found the Academyites doing a hodge podge of different activities. Graham took to the road on foot to show off his tattoos to the townfolk in Tahoe City. Erin and Yvonne went shopping in town.  Circa 4 PM Steve loaded up the group in his oven…I mean van, and headed off to Squaw Valley; site of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The group took the gondola to the top and hit the ice rink for some falling. Jon, Steve, and Erin had a race, and Erin would have won if not for a cheap shot from Steve. He must have still been mad about that Roulette game in Reno. The view of Lake Tahoe from the Squaw Ice Rink was spectacular, but not nearly as spectacular as Jon's ice dancing. Three words man…'Pocahontas on Ice'! Rob thought about skating, but decided he would rather slide with a sweet pair of hiking boot skates (no blades).</p>

<p>After the ice rink the future space gurus invaded Alexander's restaurant. We had a close call here, but Mike was quick to act in saving Sierra-Nevada from a doomed trip down the kitchen sink. Power to you Mike, 5 hero points. After filling their bellies the group left Alexander's and embarked on the dark gondola ride down the mountain. Julia and Jay argued over getting the bends and eventually ended in a stalemate. Once back at the lodges the group started the deep clean, taking great care to tidy up in thanks of our hosts' generosity. Thanks a million to Doug and Christy O'Handley and Bob and Helene Zimmerman for a fantastic trip to Lake Tahoe. Come Sunday it was Au Revoir Sierra and Salut Mountain View once again.</p>
