<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, we head north from Rome to look first at the largest city in the Po Valley. Nestled near the Alps is the industrial city of Milan, seen here in this Landsat-4 image:

<p><div align="center"><img src="milan.jpg" width=324 height=317 border=0 alt="Milan - wine-colored blotch - in the western Po Valley."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Landmarks abound in this town. Well known is the Duomo or cathedral, with its gothic spires but also with the Italian flare:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="milan_duomo5.jpg" width=288 height=215 border=0 alt="Milan's Duomo."></div></p> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most famous opera house in the world is La Scala, where some of the operas of Verdi and Puccini were premiered:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Scala_Mailand.jpg" width=324 height=208 border=0 alt="The La Scala Opera House."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, let's take a glance at the head of the Adriatic where the canal city of Venice is located. First, to set it in context to the mainland, examine this ASTER image.

<p><div align="center"><img src="Venice_TAS2001347.jpg" width=360 height=330 border=0 alt="ASTER view of the coast of northeast Italy and the offshore islands that include Venezia (Venice) on the large brown island just left of center."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, we move a bit closer to look at Venice and the Mainland (Maestri) as seen by IRS-1:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="irs_liss_venice.jpg" width=442 height=294 border=0 alt="IRS-1 view of Venice and adjacent mainland."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, this is how the astronauts on the International Space Station saw the islands that include Venice proper, with north to the right.:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="ISS001-ESC-6691.jpg" width=360 height=239 border=0 alt="ISS astronaut photo, labeled, of Venice."></div>

 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a closer look at Venice as imaged by ESA's PROBA; the Rialto and the Grand Canal stand out:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="VENICE_ITALY_crop4in.jpg" width=288 height=288 border=0 alt="Venice, Italy; PROBA image; the image has a bit of the island of Murano at the top and  the Venice Lido at the bottom."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The closest view yet has been made by IKONOS. It shows the most visited part of Venice containing the cluster of buildings northeast (right in image) of the Grand Canal:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="r58_ikonos_venise_800.jpg" width=468 height=308 border=0 alt="IKONOS 1 m image of central Venice."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This ground photo, looking along the Grand Canal, is the scene that most of us conjure up when asked to think of Venice; the bridge is evident in the IKONOS image and helps to place this view in context:</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Venice, a city founded in the 5th Century AD, is now under serious threat of being gradually inundated by the Adriatic. Rise in sea level and a slow sinking as ground water is withdrawn from the islands are causing a rise in water level by an average 3 mm. a year. In recent years this has led to flooding of the Piazza San Marco by as much as 60 times a year, as shown in this photo (big question: will the famed pigeons be replaced by ducks?):</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="SanMarcosSquare1.jpg" width=280 height=266 border=0 alt="The catwalk solution to frequent flooding of San Marcos Square in Venice; from Sept. 27, 2003 issue of The Economist."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various solutions to save the main island are being tried: pumping water back into aquifers; sealing off ground floors; putting floodgates to prevent water from the Adriatic entering the lagoon during high water and  storms; replanting stabilizing eel grass on mudflats; deepening the lagoon. But if global warming brings about the threatened major rise in sea level, Venice proper may become a city in the sea rather than by the sea. Plan your visit soon.</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already explored the tip of the Balkans in the detailed consideration of Athens in the Answers to the Quiz after page 9 of this Section. Now we will look to the north of Greece at a Terra MISR image of the southern part of Serbia and once other segments of the 20th century Yugoslavia:

<p><div align="center"><img src="PIA02627.jpg" width=202 height=265 border=0 alt="Terra MISR image of parts of Serbia and Montenegro, along the Adriatic coast; the lake-like blue area just in from the coast is the Bay of Kotor. "></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Landsat subscene includes the Bay of Kotor and, upcoast, the medieval city of Dubrovnik (where the writer and his wife spent 5 memorable days including several excursions to the Bay, to Mostar, and to the island of Korcula [birthplace of Christopher Columbus]): </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="po00175_c.jpg" width=324 height=229 border=0 alt="Dubrovnik, on the coast of Croatia.">
</div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Several of the major cities in this southeastern part of Europe are now shown. The first images show Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and Belgrade, the capital of the now shrunken Yugoslavia which had included Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Montenegro in its larger post-World War II status.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Zagreb_ERS_SAR.jpg" width=288 height=283 border=0 alt="ERS SAR image of Zagreb, Croatia, located on the Sava River."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the east is Romania (initially a province of Imperial Rome, which accounts for the latin influence in the Romanian language). Its capital is Bucharest, shown in this Landsat image:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Bucharest_1988.jpg" width=300 height=300 border=0 alt="Bucharest, Romania."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although attacked during the last stages of the Second World War, much of Bucharest escaped serious damage. It has grown now into a modern city:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="7610064KinTqDvajO_ph.jpg" width=300 height=197 border=0 alt="View of Bucharest, Romania."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Carpathian Mountains cut through Romania and extend into southern Poland:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Carpathian-201.jpg" width=261 height=287 border=0 alt="The Carpathian Mountains"></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We next want to look at the most majestic mountain scenery in Europe - the Alps, first with a look at the highest mountain in the Alps, in France, then at all of Switzerland and finally, in some detail, Austria. In the Landsat 7 ETM+ scene below is much of the French Alps (one of the images (Item B) in the Quiz of Section 6 showing the <a href="../Sect6/game.html">Rhone Valley</a> includes this region as well). Also, look at the mosaic of the entire Alps on <a href="../Sect7/Sect7_3.html">page 7-3</a>. In this image is the famed Mt. Blanc (4807 m; 15707 ft) first climbed in the 1870s.

<p><div align="center"><img src="landsat_mtblanc_30jul01.jpg" width=338 height=338 border=0 alt="Mt. Blanc in the French Alps."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next scene in a space imagery mosaic of all of Switzerland (bounded by white lines), which upon seeing surprised this writer (NMS) by the proportion (upper half) of that country consisting of lowlands and low mountains, something he did not fully appreciate during his several trips to that country (with my penchant for alpine vistas, I headed south with alacrity): </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="schweiz.jpg" width=360 height=209 border=0 alt="Image mosaic of Switzerland."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the great cities of Switzerland is Geneva, which is a center for international law. The city is situated at the west end of Lake Geneva (Lake Leman), shown in the astronaut photo below </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Lake-Geneva-west-satellite-v1.jpg" width=367 height=243 border=0 alt="Lake Geneva, also known as Lake Leman"></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our 1968 trip to Europe, my wife and I reached Geneva by train at 11 at night on August 1, Switzerland's National Independence Day. We had no idea where our hotel was. We got into a taxi, I mentioned the hotel, we drove 6 blocks, and reached the hotel - 100 feet from the train station. Flim-flamers are everywhere!</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The largest city in Switzerland is Zurich, located at the north end of Lake Zurich, not far from the German border. Here is an ESA SAR image of the city and low hills around it. The black lines at the top are runways at its airport; these appear dark here because they act as a specular mirror when radar waves strike them, thus giving a minimum of backscatter.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Zurich_ERS_SAR.jpg" width=320 height=294 border=0 alt="Radar image of Zurich, Switzerland; ESA SAR."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A similar-type mosaic presents all of Austria, with mountains everywhere except to the north and east of Vienna (Plains of Hungary). Below it is a map of Austria showing the principal citis. </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="oes_sm.jpg" width=360 height=184 border=0 alt="Space image mosaic of Austria."></div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Viennamap.jpg" width=354 height=272 border=0 alt="Geographic map of Austria."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To set north-central Austria into context from space, here is an Envisat ASAR radar image (note the pronounced layover). Salzburg is in a valley (shown prominently in the movie "Sound of Music") visible near the left center edge of the scene. </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Salzburg_ASA_IMP_Orbit07655_20030817_hi.jpg" width=367 height=363 border=0 alt="Envisat ASAR image of the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, including Salzburg."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look at a high resolution space view of this charming small city set in a valley drained by the Salz River. Below it is an enlargement of the Envisat ASAR image above, in which Salzburg was cropped out.</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a photo of the city of Salzburg, famed for its music festivals honoring Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born there in 1756 (he actually hated the town, partly because of its provincialism but mainly because of his servitude to the unappreciative Archbishop Collaredo). It was here in 1960 where the writer (NMS) heard Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro" in the Festspielhaus, given by the finest cast I've encountered in the many opera performances I've attended.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="SlikaSalzburg2.jpg" width=360 height=164 border=0 alt="View of the city of Salzburg."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This photo shows the castle on a promentory and the Cathedral below. Many should remember it from the wedding of Maria and the Baron von Trapp in the "Sound of Music". </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="SlikaSalzburg1.jpg" width=360 height=171 border=0 alt="Looking up at the castle in Salzburg."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then on to Vienna, for several centuries the music capital of the world that attracted such classical notables as Joseph Hadyn, Wolfgang Mozart, Ludwig von Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, and Arnold Schoenberg. Here first is a Landsat overview:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="ViennaArea.jpg" width=270 height=316 border=0 alt="Landsat subscene of Vienna, Austria area."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The city itself (blue area) lies along the Danube River at the eastern tip of the Austrian Alps - location of the famed Vienna Woods. This next image is an IKONOS detail of the central city, lying within the broad streets which tie together as the Ringstrasse:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="wiencity.jpg" width=288 height=268 border=0 alt="Inner Wien (Vienna) seen from space at high resolution."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Below is a map of this part of the city:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="kaart_wenen.jpg" width=345 height=316 border=0 alt="Map of part of Vienna."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a panorama of Vienna seen looking west from the Danube River, with the Vienna Woods hills in the background:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="vie1.jpg" width=432 height=103 border=0 alt="View of Vienna."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In that view is a high steeple. This is St. Stephens Cathedral, at 405 feet the highest point in the city. The next scene shows that Cathedral with the AugustinaKirche in the left foreground:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="vienna_1.jpg" width=320 height=240 border=0 alt="St. Stephens Cathedral spire and the dome of the AugustinaKirche."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A walk through the buildings of Old Wien gives a flavor for the medieval part of this city.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="wienfoto-trinitycolumn.jpg" width=306 height=204 border=0 alt="Vienna street."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, one of Vienna's most famous building's - the Opera House on the Ringstrasse. The building we see below is an almost exact copy of the 19th century original edifice that was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War and then rebuilt as a duplicate. It was here in 1986 that I spent $100 U.S. for a ticket to hear Bizet's <i>Carmen</i> - the biggest splurge in my musical life.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="staatsoper.jpg" width=283 height=199 border=0 alt="The Wien Operhaus."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several hundred miles northeast of Vienna is the picturesque city of Prague, now the capital of the Czech Republic. When the writer (NMS) visited it in 1968 it was part of Czechoslovakia, but the eastern half has separated into Slovakia, a separate country now. Here is a satellite view of this city:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="10m_Prague2_r2_c3.jpg" width=310 height=308 border=0 alt="10-m satellite image of Prague, Czech Republic."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Add to this a Quickbird-2 image of part of Prague at 4 meter resolution:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="prague_before_flood_col080602_dg.jpg" width=432 height=314 border=0 alt="Part of northern Prague, seen by Quickbird"></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, look at Prague from this low-angle aerial photograph:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="sspn4760.jpg" width=506 height=108 border=0 alt="Aerial view of Prague, Czech Republic."></div>
<div align="center">Courtesy: Carolina Map Distributors</div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A feel for the scenery of this lovely city is offered by this ground photo of the Prague Castle and the St. Vitus Church:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="roofs.jpg" width=317 height=209 border=0 alt="Same area of Prague from a different perspective."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My wife and I were visiting Prague as I participated in the International Geological Congress held in this city. This was the time of the "Prague Spring" when Alexander Dubcek was leading his country into a rapprochement with their Soviet masters. Tensions were high. On the night of August 22, 1968, being a light sleeper I was awakened by a loud noise sounding like a low flying jet aircraft. This was repeated thrice in the next 5 minutes. I woke my wife saying "Wake up, we're being invaded." I was right. Troops from the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland had been ordered to occupy Czechoslovokia, their East European Bloc member state, to put an end to the Czechs' bid for some freedom. We stayed up the rest of the night listening to Radio Prague as it tried to warn the people. The next morning we were greeted with this scene from our Hotel Europa window:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="PragueInvasion.jpg" width=300 height=244 border=0 alt="Tanks and armored vehicles moving along the main thoroughfare of downtown Prague."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congress ended abruptly and I never really toured this enchanting medieval city (but my wife did). After two more hair-raising nights (one with hundreds of automatic weapons fired at some resisters in a building across the street), we were finally evacuated to Nurnberg on a train that carried 1400+ internationals (its capacity was 640 passengers). The normally 5 hour trip took almost 12 hours. No food on the train, but when we stopped in Pilsen, the townfolk passed sandwiches and Pilsener beer to everyone on the train. No wonder I value my Bohemian ancestry.</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among troops of the Warsaw Pact that invaded Czechoslovakia were soldiers of the Polish Army. Warsaw, the capital of Poland, was devastated by the German occupation Army and then the Soviets during all of World War II. It has since been largely restored. Here is an ERS SAR view of modern Warsaw.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Warsaw_ERS_SAR.jpg" width=288 height=300 border=0 alt="Warsaw, Poland, imaged by the ERS SAR radar."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A sense of how modern most of Warsaw now appears is given in this wide-view (panoramic) camera photo (scroll right to see its full extent):</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="panorama0.jpg" width=1140 height=107 border=0 alt="Panoramic view of central Warsaw."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the Poles were careful in rebuilding their city to maintain and restore the Old Town. This photo shows
the Plac Zamkowy (a castle on a square).</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="placzam.jpg" width=300 height=215 border=0 alt="Old Town in Warsaw."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the northeast lie the Balkan States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, now independent countries after the demise of the Soviet Union. As typical of their cities here is Riga, capital of Latvia.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Riga_ERS_SAR.jpg" width=274 height=278 border=0 alt="Riga, Latvia."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another capital city, Tallinn, in Estonia appears in this Quickbird image:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="tallinn_msi_july04_2004_dg.jpg" width=360 height=274 border=0 alt="High resolution image showing Tallinn, Estonia.">
</div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent country after the breakup of the Union in 1989. It is now the third largest country in Europe. Its capital is Kiev, a city of 3 million on the Dneiper River:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="kiev.jpg" width=360 height=293 border=0 alt="Kiev, as seen by Landsat-7."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kiev is a mix of the old and the new. As seen from the Botanical Gardens and the Vydubychi Monastery, many apartment buildings line the Dneiper. In the town itself are quaint old churches used in the Russian Orthodox faith.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="750px-Kiev-BotanicalGarden-1280.jpg" width=324 height=259 border=0 alt="View of part of Kiev; Wikipedia photo."></div></p>

	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now swing  northeastward to Moscow, the capital of Russia, revealed in this snow-covered (late February, 1974) scene because it is a "heat island" even in winter, so that the streets are mainly cleared. The many dark patches spread across the countryside are copses of evergreen forests, mixed with deciduous trees. Between them are open fields cleared for agriculture that includes rye and oats for food, flax for fabric, and feed for dairy cattle. This alternating interspersion of woods and farmlands must have proved daunting both to Napoleon in 1812 and Hitler in 1941 in their ill-fated winter attacks on Moscow. The large "river" north of Moscow is actually the 130 km (80 mile) long Moscow Canal, a manmade channel designed to connect the Volga headwaters with the Moskva River.</p> 

<div align="center"><img src="Moscow.JPG" width=300 height=295 border=0 alt="The forested lowlands before Moscow (large black blotch in right center), in winter."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's zoom in on the city and its environs as imaged in Spring by Landsat-7s ETM+:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Moscow_L719991006.jpg" width=288 height=289 border=0 alt="Moscow and surroundings: Landsat-7 ETM+ image."></div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Moscow1.JPG" width=346 height=302 border=0 alt="Inner Moscow."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The center of Moscow is the Kremlin Triangle, which includes Red Square, scene of massive military parades each October during the Soviet Era. Here is a view of that area.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="13602-0.jpg" width=324 height=227 border=0 alt="Aerial view of central Moscow."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now look closer at the image found on the top of the <a href="../Sect6/game.html">Geography Quiz page</a> in this Section. There, we saw St. Petersburg (to most older readers, once known as Leningrad) in its regional context. Now, we examine it close up as imaged by the Indian IRS-1 satellite:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="StPetersburg.jpg" width=274 height=272 border=0 alt="IRS image of St. Petersburg, Russia."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tie between St. Petersburg and the Neva River is shown in this aerial photo.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="vasili.jpg" width=299 height=212 border=0 alt="Aerial view along the River Neva in St. Petersburg."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most famed building in St. Petersburg is the Hermitage, once the Winter Palace of the Czars, and now one of the great fine arts museums in the world. Dmitri Shostakovich, the Russian composer, wrote his famed 7th Symphony (my favorite of all his works), to commemorate the brave citizens of Leningrad who withstood numerous onslaughts by the German Army for nearly three years during the Second World War. </p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="winterpalace.jpg" width=295 height=144 border=0 alt="The Hermitage, in St. Petersburg."></div>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another great Russian city is Volgograd, on the Volga River south of Moscow. In the 1940s, this city was named Stalingrad, after the Soviet head of state, Joseph Stalin. In the winter of 1942-43, this then industrial city was the focal point in what many consider the greatest battle (at least, the greatest urban battle) in history. As part of Operation Blau, Hitler had directed his German panzers into the Caucases to capture its oil fields. But he also sent an army to the Volga to capture his opponent's namesake. The Soviet Red Army decided to make a stand at this city. For more than 3 months, the German siege involved daily house-to-house fighting that leveled almost the entire city. But the Soviets heroically held until lack of food and ammunition forced the capitulation of the German 7th Army under Field Marshall von Paulus. The Germans lost almost 900000 troops; the Soviets somewhat less. Most historians agree that the Battle of Stalingrad was the "turning point of the Second World War" that shifted its course towards eventual Allied victory. </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two views from space put Stalingrad/Volgograd in its setting on the west side of the Volga River:</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="Volgograd_ASAR_20030416_L.jpg" width=230 height=351 border=0 alt="ESA ASAR (radar) image of Volgograd, on the left bank of the Volga River (near center of image)."></div></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This battle involved many individual attacks (the story of snipers on both sides is told in the movie "Enemy at the Gates"). One of the most ferocious is known as the Battle of the Grainery. Remote sensing documented the battlefield there in this April 1943 aerial photo:</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Photos taken during and just after Stalingrad reveal the near-total destruction of the city's infrastructure. Here are two examples:</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Russian history Stalingrad is a "holy place". As the city was being rebuilt, the Soviet leaders had a 88-meter high statue erected on Mamayev Kurgan (Hill) within the city. It symbolizes the bravery and sacrifices that all of the peoples of the Russian Federation applied to saving the motherland in (what they call) the Great Patriotic War.</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Stalingrad discussion above, we mentioned that Adolph Hitler took his generals advice and approved of a push in summer 1942 (a year after invading the Soviet Union) into the Caucases region. The goal was to capture the Baku oil fields, which, if accomplished, would have deprived the Red Army of much of its fuel - and capacity to fight. If the Germans had been successful, it is likely that the Soviet nation would have been forced to capitulate within months for lack of fuel. This might well have ended World War II in Europe since the Allies would have faced a huge, seasoned Nazi Army. But the debacle at Stalingrad siphoned off vital troops that could otherwise have reached Baku and the Caspian Sea. The Caucasus were also a formidible natural barrier. The Panzers failed to approach Baku and in early 1943 had to withdraw - a move that heralded the general retreat of the Axis nations that ended in Berlin, and surrender, in May of 1945. This map covers the history of the campaign: </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Caucasus mountains, the only large range in European Russia, were formed about 25 million years ago when the Arabian plate slammed into the Eurasian plate. They are similar to the Alps in striking scenery. The region shown includes the Caucasus Mountains that include Chechnya and Georgia. Part of eastern Turkey (Armenia) is also included. Here are a space view and a ground photo:</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Europe is surrounding by oceans on three sides. But to its east is land. Where does Europe end and Asia begin. In Russia, the Ural Mountains are arbitrarily specified as the boundary. But off Greece the line of demarcation is less obvious. Again, somewhat arbitrarily this line is set at the Dardenelles-Bosporus, around Istanbul (you may have encountered this in the Section 6 Quiz). On the northwest side, this part of Turkey is said to be European; across the waters begins Asia. (Turkey as a country may enter the European sphere when/if it is admitted to the European Union.) Lets re-examine the Istanbul scene using first a radar image and then a satellite image that includes only part of Istanbul itself:</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Europe, the center for western civilization for 2500 years, has been well worth our time spent on this pair of pages. But, on to the next page which covers parts of the world which in east-central Africa and Mesopotamia are truly the "cradle" of occidental (western) civilization.</p>
