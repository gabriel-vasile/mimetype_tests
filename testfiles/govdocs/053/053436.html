Under Cowboy Sam's hat are more secrets than fleas on Doc Peeble's hound dog, more secrets than peppers on a chili pepper plant, and more secrets than spikes on a horny toad lizard. Just about everyone in the town of Dry Gulch wants to tell Sam a secret. But when his hat gets plum full of secrets and won't stay put on his head, Sam is bumfuzzled and bewildered. How can he keep all those secrets under wraps--and keep the townfolk from going crazy?
Perfectly matched by Mike Wohnoutka's comic illustrations, this funny and unexpectedly touching tale will appeal to readers young and old alike.
