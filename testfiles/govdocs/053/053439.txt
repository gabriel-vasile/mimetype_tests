FROM: Doug Bellomo, P.E., Acting Chief 

 Hazard Identification Branch 

 

SUBJECT: Procedure Memorandum No. 9 – Processing of Controlled 
Correspondence 

 

Background: The volume of mapping-related controlled correspondence processed by and through 
the Technical Services Division increased steadily over the last half of Fiscal Year 1999. This 
increase, and the recent reduction of our administrative resources, necessitated changes in the way 
we process controlled correspondence. 

 

Issue: Hazards Study Branch staff, working in unison with staff from the Office of Congressional 
and Legislative Affairs, Office of the Associate Director, and Mapping Coordination Contractors, 
held several formal and informal sessions to discuss how we should address assorted content and 
processing issues in an effort to improve turnaround time and minimize rework on assignments. The 
revised procedures and guidelines that were developed during those sessions have been 
implemented, but not completely documented. 

 

Final Procedure: This memorandum has been prepared to ensure all involved parties within FEMA 
and at the Contractors’ offices are clear about the processing requirements that were recently 
established for controlled correspondence, including a revised requirement for delayed responses to 
incoming correspondence. The procedures below are effective immediately. 

 

General Guidance 

 

In implementing these requirements, all involved parties should keep in mind that it is important that 
we convey a consistent message to the U.S. Congress and to the constituents they represent. It is 
equally important that we convey our message to them in a clear, concise, and timely manner. 

 


Routing Process and Related Documentation 

 

The routing process to be followed by FEMA and contractor staff is presented in the flowchart in 
Attachment 1. The forms to be used to ensure correct routing are presented as Attachments 1A and 
1B. 

 

General Style and Content Requirements 

 

As with all FEMA correspondence, the following standards, many of which are set forth in Chapter 
5 of FEMA Manual 5200.1 (referenced below), should be employed in preparing responses to 
controlled correspondence: 

 

• Ensure the response is clear and concise. 



• Keep sentences and paragraphs short and consistent with clarity and completeness of 
thought. 



• Use the active voice. 



• Avoid unnecessary shifts of number, tense, subject voice, or point of view. 



• Use simple, nontechnical words whenever possible. 



• Arrange material logically and in a format that will maximize the reader’s understanding 
of what is being presented. 



• Do not use contractions. 



• Minimize the use of acronyms and abbreviations. 



• Establish acronyms the first time they are used and use them consistently. 





Product-Specific Style and Content Requirements 

 

The following product-specific requirements should be employed: 

 

• Align all information in the response flush left. 



• Use the first paragraph of the response to summarize the issues raised by the Senator or 
Representative and his or her constituent without completely restating the content of the 
incoming correspondence. 



• Use the first paragraph, when necessary, to apologize for delays in responding to the 
issues raised by the Senator or Representative. To this end, include the following 
sentence in any response that will be mailed more than 30 days after the date of the 



incoming letter from the Senator or Representative: “We apologize for the delay in 
responding to your letter.” 



• Use the second paragraph of the response to address the issues raised in the incoming 
correspondence as completely as possible. 



• Provide collateral or background information in the third and subsequent paragraphs of 
the response. 



• Reference and enclose copies of NFIP maps and other informative NFIP documents 
(e.g., Appeals, Revisions, and Amendments to National Flood Insurance Program Maps, 
A Guide for Community Officials) that help to clarify the response and to enhance the 
understanding of the Senator or Representative and the constituent. 



• Use an acronym or abbreviation only if the acronym or abbreviation will appear more 
than twice in the response and if the use of the acronym or abbreviation does not detract 
from the readability of the letter. 



• Use the standard language presented in the FEMA Congressional Correspondence 
Handbook, when appropriate, to help ensure a consistent message is conveyed. 


 

Format Requirements 

 

The format requirements for controlled correspondence are summarized in Attachment 2. More 
detailed information on compound words, acronyms and abbreviations, and numerals is presented in 
Attachments 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively. Responsible FEMA and contractor staff should refer to 
the 2000 version of the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual and to FEMA Manual 
5200.1, Correspondence Management (undated), for additional guidance. The U.S. Government 
Printing Office Style Manual is available online at 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/index.html. 

 

Changes to Requirements 

 

When changes to the processing requirements for controlled correspondence are required, affected 
FEMA and contractor staff will be notified in two ways: (1) through a new Procedure Memorandum 
or (2) through an entry in the concurrence sheet (Attachment 1A). Changes to requirements made on 
the concurrence sheet will be shown under “Comments By Reviewers” and must be concurred on by 
designated parties in both the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs and the Hazards Study 
Branch.

For overall product consistency, FEMA and MCC staff should refer to Chapter 12 of the U.S. 
Government Printing Office Style Manual (hereinafter referred to as GPO Style Manual) for 
complete guidance on the use of figures and spelled-out numbers. Chapter 12 is available online at 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chap12.pdf. Listed below are rules for handling some 
of the more frequently encountered situations. 

 

1. A figure is used for a single number of 10 or more, with the exception of the first word in a 
sentence or heading (e.g., 12 counties). 



2. When 2 or more numbers appear in a sentence and 1 of the numbers is 10 or more, figures are 
used for all numbers in the sentence (e.g., of the 13 streams studied, 6 were studied by 
detailed-study methods). 



3. A spelled-out word is used for nine or less, with the exception of units of measurement or time 
(e.g., three sources of information, 3 miles). 



4. A unit of measurement (including percentage), time, or money is expressed as a figure, with 
the exception of the first word in a sentence or heading (e.g., 5 percent, 2 hours, 6 feet) 



5. A spelled-out word is used at the beginning of a sentence or heading. (e.g., Three feet of 
freeboard are required.). Authors should rephrase sentences or headings to avoid beginning 
with the number. 



6. A spelled-out number should not be repeated in figures, except in legal documents (e.g., forty 
(40) hours). 



7. For ordinal numbers, figures are used for ordinal numbers beginning with 10th (e.g., 35th) and 
spelled-out numbers are used for ordinal numbers up to and including ninth (e.g., fourth), 
except when ordinal numbers appear in juxtaposition and one of them is 10th or more; figures 
are used for all such ordinal numbers (e.g., 9th and 10th iterations). 



8. Numbers of less than 100 preceding a compound modifier containing a figure are spelled out 
(e.g., two 3-inch boards). 



9. Indefinite expressions are spelled out (e.g., the early eighties, but the early 1980s). 



10. For large numbers, beginning with million, the spelled-out version is used (Example: $12.5 
million). 



11. Related numbers appearing at the beginning of a sentence, separated by no more than three 
words, are treated alike (e.g., Seventy or eighty residents attended the meeting.).
