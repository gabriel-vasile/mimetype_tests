"NOTES: The Commodity Flow Survey covers business establishments in mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade, and selected retail industries.  The survey also covers selected auxiliary establishments (e.g., warehouses) of in-scope multiunit and retail companies.  The survey excludes establishments classified as farms, forestry, fisheries, governments, construction, transportation, foreign establishments, services, and most establishments in retail.  Due to industry-wide reporting problems, shipments by oil and gas extraction establishments are also excluded.  ""To all states"" total includes all domestic shipments from the state of origin, including intrastate shipments.  ",,,,,,,
