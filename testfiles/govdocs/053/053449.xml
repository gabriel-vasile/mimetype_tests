<abstract>
This dataset is a grid map for Florida at 30 meter
Resolution. Each pixel value represents an index of
land cover diversity for the surrounding 65.61 ha.(27x27 pixel)
analysis window.  The dataset was created by applying a
spatial filter to a published map of land cover from the
Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.
The spatial filter computed the index from the surrounding
proportions of different land cover types.
The [0,1] continuous index was discretized, and a byte
representation [1,255] was stored at the center location
(i.e., at the center pixel) in a new map. Each pixel in
the new map is an index of land cover diversity, for the
surrounding 65.61 ha window, for the corresponding pixel
in the original land cover map.
</abstract>
<purpose>
These data were created as part of a national analysis
of land cover pattern. A series of derived maps (different
indices, different window sizes) is available. They are
proposed for consideration by landscape analysts, as
independent variables (e.g., covariates, stratification
rules), and as "context" information for finer-scale
investigations, for example field plots.
Caveats include:  Maps in this series are naturally correlated
since all came from one map. No warranty or claim is made of the
utility of this map for any particular purpose, this is considered
to be a research dataset. The land cover diversity map
portrays relative diversity, of cover types recognized by the
MRLC, using a selected diversity index at one spatial scale.

The diversity index is based
On the proportion of pixels in an analysis window which
have different cover (see: Process_Step sections).
A statistical rule of thumb is that 50 observations
are needed to estimate a proportion.
The 27x27 pixel analysis window has up to 729
non-missing pixels. This index is one of several
which could have been used instead, and standard textbooks
discuss relative strengths and weaknesses. Like other
indices, this index is best interpreted as a relative
value, in comparison to other pixels on the same map.
Comparisons with other maps prepared from different
data sources or at different scale are tenuous.

Derivation of land cover diversity
from land cover:
The objective is to estimate Simpson's (1949) diversity index
by using the proportions of land cover within fixed-area
analysis windows, and to map the resulting index value.
Land cover data (MRLC) was obtained from
EROS Data Center in binary format.
The image was subdivided into sixteen (16) overlapping
rectangles using an in-house software tool named
SPLITTER.C.  The rectangles overlapped to avoid
artifacts near image boundaries during the spatial
filtering operations.
Each of the rectangles was then processed via
spatial filtering to estimate the index as described
below.  The spatial filtering program is an in-house
software tool named SPATCONV.C (Riitters et al. 1997)
After spatial filtering, a map of index
values was constructed by reassembling the 16
rectangles into a single image (via an in-house
software tool named LUMPER.C, which removed the
overlapping parts of rectangles).
The "header file" information for the derived map is
as follows.  This information is needed for some image
import filters. Ulxmap and Ulymap refer to the center of
the upper-left pixel.
nrows 23393
ncols 27314
nbands 1
nbits 8
layout bsq
skipbytes 0
ulxmap 783810.000000
ulymap 969660.000000
xdim 30.000000
ydim 30.000000
Spatial filtering proceeded as follows.
The following land cover types are recognized by the
MRLC land cover map.
11: open water
12: perennial ice/snow
21: low intensity developed
22: high intensity residential
23: high intensity commercial/industrial
31: bare rock/sand/clay
32: quarries/strip mines/gravel pits
33: transitional barren
41: deciduous forest
42: evergreen forest
43: mixed forest
51: deciduous shrubland
52: evergreen shrubland
53: mixed shrubland
61: planted/cultivated (orchards, vineyards, groves)
71: grassland/herbaceous
81: hay/pasture
82: row crops
83: small grains
84: bare soil
85: other grass (lawns, city parks, golf courses)
91: woody wetland
92: emergent herbaceous wetland
A 65.61 ha (27x27 pixel) quadrat was centered
on each pixel of the original land cover map.
The numbers of pixels in each cover type
were tabulated for the non-missing pixels in
the window. The index was then computed as
one minus the sum of squares of land cover
proportions within the quadrat.  The index ranges
from zero to one, with larger index values taken to
represent more land cover diversity.
If the center pixel was "missing" in the land cover
map, then the index was assigned a "missing" value.
Note that the index is defined for all other
land cover types.
The calculated values were discretized to the
range [1,255] and stored at 30-meter spatial
resolution.  Thus, a pixel value in the new
map represents the index for the surrounding
65.61 ha in the original land cover map.
The transformation used to discretize the
values was:
D = ( C * 254 ) + 1
where
D = discretized value in range [1,255]
C = calculated value in range [0,1]
If needed, the original calculated values can be
approximated by applying the backtransformation:
C = ( D - 1 ) / 254
The backtransformed values will be in steps of
size approximately 0.00394 as a result of the
discretization process.
