<p>JTF-8 Presents Operation Dominic, Christmas Island - 12:29 - Sound - A 
previous video release, &quot;Dominic Fireballs,&quot; (silent with captions) featured 16 
nuclear bursts conducted near Christmas Island in 1962 and presented a general 
visual overview of the test operation. This documentary presents a brief history 
of the British-owned Christmas Island and the agreement that allowed the United 
States to use it as a staging area for 24 atmospheric tests.</p>
<p>However, only three nuclear blasts are shown, each representing a different 
aspect of Operation Dominic I. ADOBE, the first airdrop of a thermonuclear 
device on April 25, 1962, had a yield of 190 kilotons (kt). This was a proof 
test of a device prior to it going into the nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<p>The second test, FRIGATE BIRD, involved a warhead (yield not given) launched 
on May 6, 1962, from the submarine Ethan Allen and carried to its target by a 
Polaris missile. It was an atmospheric test. The third test, SWORDFISH, a 
low-yield device (less than 20 kilotons), was a system proof test of an 
antisubmarine rocket (ASROC) conducted on May 11, 1962. The weapon, an atomic 
depth charge, was successfully detonated underwater after its ride on the ASROC.</p>
<p>EG&amp;G Operation Dominic Scientific Photography Bluestone Test - 10:00 - Silent 
- This video shows the BLUESTONE thermonuclear airdrop from several vantage 
points at various camera speeds and focal lengths. Conducted near Christmas 
Island in the Pacific on June 30, BLUESTONE had a yield of 1.27 megatons. This 
test does not have the familiar mushroom cloud effect, but forms a huge circular 
fireball and as it expands, forms a large ring.</p>
<p>BLUESTONE was but one of many Dominic I tests dedicated to research and 
development of thermonuclear devices. The Dominic I series was ordered after the 
Soviet Union had resumed testing nuclear weapons.</p>
