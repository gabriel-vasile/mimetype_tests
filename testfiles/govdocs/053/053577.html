	<h2>Roderic Puchner</h2><h3>From the short story &quot;Children of God&quot;</h3>       <p>To pass the day, I took Jason and Dominic on field trips. There was a special van in the garage, and I&#39;d load Jason onto the lift and strap down his wheels so he wouldn&#39;t roll out the window. The van had been donated by a traveling magician and was painted purple. We&#39;d drive to caf&eacute;s, outdoor fairs, movie theaters. They liked easy-listening stations - &quot;I Write the Songs,&quot; &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; - and I&#39;d crank the old A.M. stereo as loud as it would go. I&#39;d roll down the windows and listen to Jason scream words at the top of his lungs, naming the passing creatures of the world like Adam on a roller coaster. &quot;Dog!&quot; he&#39;d yell. &quot;Girl! Pizza boy!&quot; Dominic would stick his head out the window of the front seat, his hair exploding in the wind. Someone had taught him how to flip people off and he&#39;d give pedestrians the finger as we passed. It was a good test of character, and I liked watching people question the simplicity of innocence. <br />         <br /> Once, at a stoplight, a guy in a fraternity sweatshirt returned the gesture and then strode up to Dominic&#39;s side of the van, his girlfriend sloping behind him. The guy&#39;s arm was outstretched to better advertise his finger, which he was following like a carrot.<br />         <br />         &quot;What the fuck, man,&quot; the guy said to Dominic. &quot;You looking for a new asshole?&quot;<br />         <br /> Dominic wagged his finger at the guy&#39;s face, enjoying himself immensely. &quot;We&#39;re going to get some ice cream,&quot; I explained.<br />         <br /> The guy took a closer look at Dominic and turned red. He dropped his hand and glanced at his girlfriend, who was regarding him with distaste. <br />         <br />         &quot;You should teach them some manners,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;This isn&#39;t the goddamn circus.&quot; <br />         <br /> At Baskin Robbins, we waited in line while the customers ahead of us sucked on little spoons. Dominic ogled the women. He was a pervert only because of his IQ; otherwise, he&#39;d have been concealing his interest like the rest of us. It was more metaphysical than sexual. Sometimes I&#39;d find him staring at a lingerie-clad model in a magazine, struck dumb with fervor, his lips moving silently as if in prayer. <br />         <br /> While we waited, Jason slumped in his wheelchair and I wiped the drool from his chin. The woman in front of us kept glancing back at him. It was always the same expression, a coded kind of smile directed at me as well, like we shared some secret knowledge about the afterlife. <br />         <br /> Finally, she couldn&#39;t resist any longer and squatted beside Jason. &quot;What&#39;s your favorite flavor?&quot; she brayed, as if she were speaking to a foreigner.<br />         <br />         He seemed to study the case of ice cream. &quot;Like trying to sell Jesus a jogging suit!&quot; <br />         <br />         &quot;That&#39;s right, dear,&quot; the woman muttered, but didn&#39;t talk to him again.<br />         <br /> When it was Dominic&#39;s turn to order, he staggered around the counter before I could stop him and stood by the cash register. The girl behind the counter laughed. He stared at her breasts without speaking. I might have done something to ward off disaster, but I wanted to see what would happen. <br />         <br /> &quot;Show me what you want,&quot; she said. It was the wrong thing to say. Dominic grabbed one of her breasts. &quot;Hey,&quot; the girl said, laughing. She tried to pull away and he held on, clutching at her shirt. He wore an expression of deep, incredulous despair. &quot;Hey!&quot; the girl said. Finally, I ran around the counter and pulled Dominic off with two hands, leading him back to the customer side, where he seemed unembarrassed by his conduct. <br />         <br />       It was always like that: the world scorned them, but they were freely and openly themselves. I admired them greatly. </p>       <p>From MUSIC THROUGH THE FLOOR by Eric Puchner. Copyright &copy; 2005 by Eric Puchner.

<h3 class="gapcategory"><br>Author&#039;s Statement</h3><p>I&#39;m thrilled and grateful to receive an NEA fellowship. The money will allow me to devote more time to my novel: since the birth of my eight-month old daughter, it&#39;s been difficult to find affordable childcare, so my wife and I have been taking up the slack. Now I&#39;ll have much more time to write. After my Stanford job ends (alas, only a fellowship), I plan to take a year off to work on the novel, which means I can put off the search for full-time employment until it&#39;s done. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do any of this without an NEA fellowship. Truly, it&#39;s a godsend.</p>
