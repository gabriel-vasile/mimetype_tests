<p>0800061 - Operation Dominic Nuclear Tests - 1962 - 26:23 - Black&amp;White - This 
Dominic I video provides a visual overview of 36 atmospheric nuclear devices 
detonated in the Pacific Proving Ground from April to November 1962. It was the 
last atmospheric nuclear test series conducted by the United States. Also, 
Dominic I was the largest and most elaborate U.S. testing operation ever 
conducted. In geographic terms, the diagnostic stations receiving data from the 
tests covering more than 15 million square miles.</p>
<p>According to the video, Operation Dominic I was prompted by the &quot;Soviet 
resumption of testing in 1961 after a three-year moratorium.&quot; The three main 
purposes of the series were the &quot;proof testing&quot; of new weapon designs, mainly 
thermonuclear; obtaining weapons effects data as it related to the 
electromagnetic pulse phenomenon and attenuation of radar; and obtaining data 
related to the offensive and defensive aspects of an incoming ballistic missile 
in a detonation environment.</p>
<p>Dominic I tests were conducted in three general locations: Johnston Island, 
airdrop and high-altitude detonations; Christmas Island, staging area for 24 
airdrop tests; and the open ocean, launch of a Polaris missile from a submarine 
and subsequent detonation of a device in a reentry vehicle, and the detonation 
of a device carried by an antisubmarine rocket (ASROC).</p>
<p>Approximately 28,000 military and civilian personnel participated in the test 
series. More than 200,000 tons of supplies, construction materials, and 
diagnostic equipment were shipped or airlifted to the test areas.</p>
<p>Most of the devices were detonated in the air after being dropped from a B-52 
bomber. Five high-altitude bursts, designated as Operation Fishbowl tests, were 
lofted by rockets. Their purpose was to study the effects of nuclear detonations 
as defensive weapons against incoming ballistic missiles.</p>
