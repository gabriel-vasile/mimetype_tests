           NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE

                                        Released: March 27, 2003

By the District Director, Philadelphia Office, Enforcement 
Bureau:

                        I.  INTRODUCTION

     1.   In this  Notice of  Apparent Liability  for  Forfeiture 
("NAL"), we find  that Dominic DeNaples  has apparently  violated 
Sections 1.903(a) of the  Commission's Rules (the ``Rules'')1  by 
transmitting on an unauthorized frequency.  This section requires 
that a licensee operate its station in compliance with the  terms 
of the station authorization.  We conclude that Dominic  DeNaples 
is apparently  liable for  a  forfeiture in  the amount  of  four 
thousand dollars ($4,000). 

                         II.  BACKGROUND

     2.   On March 19, 2002, a  licensee, filed a complaint  with 
the Enforcement  Bureau's Philadelphia  Office alleging  that  an 
unidentified auto  parts dealer  was causing  harmful  co-channel 
interference to his radio communications on the frequency 154.515 
MHz.  While investigating the complaint  on January 14, 2003,  an 
FCC  Agent   with  the   Philadelphia  Office   monitored   radio 
communications on the frequency 154.515 MHz from persons who were 
apparently involved in the distribution of auto parts.

     3.   On January 14,  2003 between 2:30  p.m. and 3:15  p.m., 
the  agent  used   direction-finding  techniques  to   positively 
determine that  the  source of  the  radio transmissions  on  the 
frequency 154.515 MHz  was located  at DeNaples  Auto Parts,  400 
Mill Street, Dunmore, Pennsylvania  18512.  During an  inspection 
of  the  company's  radio  communications  equipment,  the  agent 
determined that DeNaples Auto Parts  operated a base station  and 
mobile radios on the frequency 154.515 MHz.  

     4.   Mr. Dominic DeNaples,  the owner of  the DeNaples  Auto 
Parts,  acknowledged  that   he  is  the   owner  of  the   radio 
communications equipment and responsible  for its operation.   He 
provided the FCC  agent with a  copy of the  license for  station 
WNKK817 as evidence that he  was authorized to operate the  radio 
communication  equipment.   However,  the  license  for   station 
WNKK817  only   authorized   Mr.  DeNaples   to   operate   radio 
communications equipment  on  the frequencies  452.1750  MHz  and 
457.1750 MHz  at 400  Mill  Street, Dunmore,  Pennsylvania.   The 
Commission has no record that the Dominic DeNaples was authorized 
to operate any  radio communications equipment  on the  frequency 
154.515 MHz.

                        III.  DISCUSSION

     5.   Section 1.903(a) of the Rules requires that stations in 
the Wireless  Radio Service  must be  used and  operated only  in 
accordance with the rules applicable to their particular  service 
as set forth in this title and with a valid authorization granted 
by the Commission under the provisions of this part.  On  January 
14,  2003,   Dominic  DeNaples   operated  radio   communications 
equipment on the unauthorized frequency 154.515 MHz, in violation 
of Section 1.903(a) of the Rules.
 
     6.   Based on the evidence before  us, we find that  Dominic 
DeNaples willfully2 violated Sections 1.903(a) of the Rules.  The 
Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and Amendment of Section 
1.80 of the Rules to  Incorporated the Forfeiture Guidelines,  12 
FCC Rcd 17087, 17113 (1997), recon. denied, 15 FCC Rcd  303(1999) 
(``Forfeiture Policy Statement''),3 sets the base forfeiture  for 
operating on an unauthorized  frequency at four thousand  dollars 
($4,000).  In assessing the  monetary forfeiture amount, we  must 
take into  account the  statutory factors  set forth  in  Section 
503(b)(2)(D) of the Communications  Act of 1934,4 (the  ``Act''), 
as amended, which include the nature, circumstances, extent,  and 
gravity of the violation, and  with respect to the violator,  the 
degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability  to 
pay, and other such matters as justice may require.  Applying the 
Forfeiture Policy  Statement and  the  statutory factors  to  the 
instant case and applying  the inflation adjustments, we  believe 
that a four thousand dollar ($4,000) forfeiture is warranted.  

                      IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES

     7.   Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section 
503(b) of the  Act5, and Sections  0.111, 0.311 and  1.80 of  the

LIABILITY FOR A FORFEITURE in the amount of four thousand dollars 
($4,000) for  operating  radio  communications  equipment  on  an 
unauthorized frequency, in violation  of Section 1.903(a) of  the 
Rules.   

     8.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of 
the Rules, within thirty days of the release date of this  NOTICE

0008-27-4771. 

     11.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling 
a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless 
the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most 
recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared
