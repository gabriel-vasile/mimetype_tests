STS-91 Commander Charles Precourt peers through an airlock like the
one that will be aboard the orbiter Discovery when it docks with the
Russian Space Station Mir on the ninth and final scheduled Mir docking
in late May/early June. Precourt is in KSC's Orbiter Processing
Facility Bay 2 for the STS-91 Crew Equipment Interface Test, or CEIT,
during which the crew have an opportunity to get a hands-on look at
the payloads with which they will be working on-orbit.  The STS-91
crew are scheduled to launch aboard the Shuttle Discovery from KSC's
Launch Pad 39A on May 28 at 8:05 EDT.

Chang-Diaz, Ph.D. They are here to participate in the Terminal
Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT), a dress rehearsal for launch.
The STS-91 launch is targeted for June 2 with a launch window opening
around 6:10 p.m. EDT.  The mission will conclude Phase I of the joint
U.S.-Russian International Space Station Program. Although it will be
the ninth Shuttle docking with the Russian Space Station Mir, it will
be the first Mir docking for the Space Shuttle orbiter Discovery. The
STS-91 mission will also be the first flight for the new Space Shuttle
super lightweight external tank. Andrew Thomas, Ph.D., will be
returning to Earth with the crew after living aboard Mir since January
25, 1998.

Preliminary reports indicate the Space Shuttle's first super
lightweight external tank (SLWT) is in excellent condition following
the completion of a tanking test yesterday during a simulated launch
countdown at Launch Pad 39A. The pad's Rotating Service Structure will
be closed around Discovery later today as preparations for the STS-91
launch on June 2 continue. The primary objectives of the test were to
evaluate the strut loads between the tank and the solid rocket
boosters and to verify the integrity of the new components of the
tank. The SLWT is 7,500 pounds lighter than its predecessors and was
developed to increase the Shuttle payload capacity on International
Space Station assembly flights. Major changes to the lighter tank
include the use of new materials and a revised internal design. The
new liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks are constructed of
aluminum lithium -- a lighter, stronger material than the metal alloy
currently used. The redesigned walls of the liquid hydrogen tank were
machined to provide additional strength and stability, as well.  The
STS-91 mission will also feature the ninth Shuttle docking with the
Russian Space Station Mir, the first Mir docking for Discovery, and
the conclusion of Phase I of the joint U.S.-Russian International

the Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off from Launch Pad 39A at 6:06:24
p.m. EDT June 2 on its way to the Mir space station. On board
Discovery are Mission Commander Charles J. Precourt; Pilot Dominic
L. Gorie; and Mission Specialists Wendy B. Lawrence, Franklin
R. Chang-Diaz, Janet Lynn Kavandi and Valery Victorovitch Ryumin. The
nearly 10-day mission will feature the ninth and final Shuttle docking
with the Russian space station Mir, the first Mir docking for the
Space Shuttle orbiter Discovery, the first on-orbit test of the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), and the first flight of the new Space
Shuttle super lightweight external tank. Astronaut Andrew S. W.
Thomas will be returning to Earth as a STS-91 crew member after living
more than four months aboard Mir.

The last mission of the Shuttle-Mir program      
begins as the Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off from Launch Pad 39A at
6:06:24 p.m. EDT June 2. A torrent of water is seen flowing onto the mobile
launcher platform (MLP) from numerous large quench nozzles, or "rainbirds,"
mounted on its surface. This water, part of the Sound Suppression System,
helps protect the orbiter and its payloads from damage by acoustical energy
and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and MLP during launch. On
board Discovery are Mission Commander Charles J. Precourt; Pilot Dominic L.
Gorie; and Mission Specialists Wendy B. Lawrence, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz,
