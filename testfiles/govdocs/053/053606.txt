REMARKS:
081500Z POSITION NEAR 24.9S 53.6E.
TROPICAL CYCLONE (TC) 13S (GAEL), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 225 NM SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST OF LA REUNION, HAS TRACKED SOUTHWARD AT 13 KNOTS OVER THE
PAST 06 HOURS. INCREASING VERTICAL WIND SHEAR AHEAD OF A MIDLATITUDE
TROUGH APPROACHING THE SYSTEM FROM THE SOUTHWEST HAS INITIATED A
WEAKENING TREND. HOWEVER, THE CYCLONE STILL EXHIBITED A 16 NM
DIAMETER EYE IN RECENT MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE IMAGEREY. TC 13S IS
ACCELERATING GENERALLY SOUTHWARD TO SOUTH-SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE
BAROCLINIC ZONE AHEAD OF THE PREVIOUSLY-MENTIONED MIDLATITUDE
TROUGH. THIS MOTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.
INCREASING VERTICAL WIND SHEAR, PASSAGE OVER COOLER WATER, AND THE
INTRODUCTION OF A MIDLATITUDE AIRMASS BY THE APPROACHING TROUGH WILL
INDUCE THE FIRST STAGE OF EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION BY TAU 24, AND
THE SYSTEM WILL BE FULLY EXTRATROPICAL BY TAU 36. HOWEVER, STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL DIFFLUENCE AHEAD OF THE MIDLATITUDE TROUGH WILL ALLOW
THE TC 13S TO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH AS IT COMPLETES THIS
TRANSITION OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT
AT 081200Z IS 24 FEET. NEXT WARNINGS AT 090300Z AND 091500Z. REFER
TO TROPICAL CYCLONE 14S (FREDDY) WARNINGS (WTXS32 PGTW) FOR TWELVE-
HOURLY UPDATES.//
