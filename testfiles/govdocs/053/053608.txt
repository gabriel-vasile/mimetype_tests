NASA CALLS FOR COMMENT ON DRAFT ARES V REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

WASHINGTON -- NASA has released a draft request for proposals, or RFP, 
regarding Phase I of its Ares V launch vehicle. The rocket will 
perform heavy lift and cargo functions as part of the next generation 
of spacecraft that will return humans to the moon. Phase I will 
define operational concepts, develop requirements, and refine design 
concepts for the Ares V. 

This document is a draft of the final version of the RFP for Phase I, 
expected in January 2009. By responding to this draft RFP, potential 
offerors can provide input on the requirements, small business goals 
and contract structure. The industry input received will be combined 
with NASA's expertise for potential inclusion in the final version of 
the RFP for Phase I, which will ask for bids on five Ares V work 
packages. 

A pre-solicitation conference is scheduled for Dec. 3, 2008, at NASA's 
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The conference is 
designed for information sharing about the Ares V Phase I for 
potential offerors.
