Dear U.S.  TTB,

Everything I consume, from food to non-alcoholic beverages to medications and even dietary supplements, provides basic consumer facts about the product on the label. Yet I've noticed that my favorite spirits, beer and wine bottles do not contain that information. 

Alcohol beverages are the only major category of consumable product that is largely forbidden by the government from disclosing this kind of helpful information, and that is why I hope the TTB will allow beverage alcohol companies to voluntarily put labels on their products.

Consumers want this information and the industry wants to provide it. Common sense says that these labels should be permitted. I urge you to allow beverage alcohol companies to put basic nutritional information on their packages.

Thank you very much for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Dominic Conway
