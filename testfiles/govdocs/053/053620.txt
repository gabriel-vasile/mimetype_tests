We are planning a Linux (Beowulf) cluster for running NWChem. Our current
design is for 8 nodes. Each is an Athlon 1.4 GHz dual processor with 1 GB of
ram, 20 GB of disk, communicating with fast ethernet. Cost is approx 17 K$.
We are anticipating running 4 nodes per problem, since we expect that fast
ethernet will not scale very well past 4 nodes. We have already tested the
1.2 GHz processors in dual mode and they are as fast or faster mostly than
1.7 GHz Pentium IV dual Zeons.

The alternate is to use Myrinet for communication. This adds approximately
14 K$ or almost double the cost. We would expect that this would scale well
to 8 nodes. Hence we could do each problem twice as fast, but throughput
would be the same.  

So the question is: will fast ethernet perform well enough with these fast
processors so that 4 nodes will run approximately 4 times faster?  We
anticipate running large DFT jobs mainly. 

Does anyone have any experience or opinions? Any advice is welcome...
