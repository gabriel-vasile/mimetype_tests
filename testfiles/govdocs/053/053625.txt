INITIAL DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE
EDWAR                            D LUTON

Issue         d: March 10, 1995 ; Released: March 17, 1995


                         I. Preliminary Statement

          1.  By Order to Show Cause and Hearing Designation Order, 8 FCC
Rcd 8414 (MMB 1993) ("Show Cause Order"), the Chief, Audio Services Division,
Mass Media Bureau, ordered Cavan Communications Corporation ("Cavan') to show
cause why its license for Station WTMS(AM), Presque Isle, Maine, should not
be revoked upon the following issues:

     (a)  To determine whether Cavan Communications Corporation
          has the capability and intent to expeditiously resume
          broadcast operations of WTMS(AM) consistent with the
          Commission's Rules.

     (b)  To determine whether Cavan Communications Corporation
          has violated Sections 73.1740 and/or 73.1750 of the
          Commission's Rules.

     (c)  To determine, in light of the evidence adduced
          pursuant to the foregoing issues, whether Cavan
          Communications Corporation is qualified to be and
          remain the licensee of Station WTMS(AM). 




          2.  The Show Cause Order placed the burden of proceeding with the
introduction of the evidence and the burden of proof with respect to the
designated issues upon the Mass Media Bureau. The Show Cause Order also
directed that, if it is determined that revocation of the WTMS(AM) license is
not warranted, the Presiding Judge shall determine, pursuant to 503(b) of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, whether to issue an Order of Forfeiture
against Cavan in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for the willful and/or repeated
violation of 73.1740 and/or 73.1750 of the Commission's Rules. 

          3.  A hearing in this proceeding was held in Washington, D.C., on
March 24, 1994, after which the record was closed. See Order, FCC 94M-198
(released March 28, 1994).

II. Findings of Fact

          4.  Cavan purchased WTMS(AM) and co-located sister station WTMS-FM
(also licensed to serve Presque Isle, Maine) On November 1, 1987. Initially, the
AM and FM stations were programmed separately, and WTMS(AM) employed its own live
on-air staff. From the outset, revenues from the operation of WTMS(AM) fell short
of Cavan's expectations. In an effort to trim expenses, Cavan commenced
simulcasting the two stations in the fall of 1989. Nevertheless, the cash-flow
from the combined operation of the two stations remained disappointing. (Cavan
Ex. 1, p. 1). 

          5.  On or about March 29, 1991, the main transmitter tube for
WTMS(AM) failed, and the station went off the air. Cavan determined that it could
not afford the expense of replacing the $2,000 tube, and the station remained
silent. (Cavan Ex. 1, p. 1).

          6.   About two months later, by letter dated May 17, 1991, Cavan
filed with the Commission its first request for authority for WTMS(AM) to stay
off the air. (MMB Ex. 1)  The letter was signed by Cavan's President, J. Dominic
Monahan ("Monahan"), who is, and was at the time, an experienced communications
attorney. (Tr. 50-51). As was his practice, Monahan obtained a date-stamped copy
of the submission demonstrating that it has been properly filed with the Office
of the Secretary of the Commission. (Tr. 52). The letter does not state exactly
when the station first went off the air. (MM Ex. 1). The Commission acted on
Cavan's request within a matter of days. By letter dated May 23, 1991, the
Commission granted Cavan temporary authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent. The
letter provided that WTMS(AM) could stay off the air through August 23, 1991. (MM
Ex. 2; Tr. 59-60).

          7. After WTMS(AM) first went dark, Cavan intended to restructure its
financing so that the company could make necessary repairs and place the station
back on the air.  Shortly, however, in the summer or fall of 1991, Cavan
abandoned plans to operate WTMS(AM)and decided instead to direct its efforts
toward selling the station (Cavan Ex. 1, p.2; Tr. 57-59).

          8. On August 23, 1991, Cavan's authority for WTMS(AM) to remain
silent expired. Cavan did not file a request for further silent authority by that
date. Approximately six months later, by letter dated February 28, 1992, the
Commission advised Cavan that WTMS(AM) was off the air without authority. The
Commission's letter of inquiry required Cavan to submit a written response within
30 days informing the Commission of the status of WTMS(AM). (MM Ex. 3; Tr. 60-
61).

          9.  By letter dated March 11, 1992, Cavan submitted its response to
the Commission's letter of inquiry. In its response, Cavan made its second
request for authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent. The letter was signed by Monahan,
who, consistent with his practice, obtained a date-stamped copy of the
correspondence demonstrating that it had been properly filed with the Office of
the Secretary of the Commission. (MM Ex. 4; Tr. 61). The Commission acted on
Cavan request within a month. By letter dated April 10, 1992, the staff granted
Cavan authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent through July 10, 1992. (MM Ex. 5; Tr. 61-
62).

          10.  By letter dated July 10, 1992, Cavan filed its third request for
authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent. Monahan authorized the filing of the
letter, and consistent with his practice, obtained a date-stamped copy
demonstrating that the correspondence had been properly filed with the Office of
the Secretary of the Commission. (MM Ex. 6; Tr. 63-64).

          11.  Less than two weeks later, the Commission responded to Cavan's
request.  A letter to Monahan dated July 23, 1992, stated that the Commission was
deferring action on Cavan's  request for further silent authority pending receipt
of an executed Anti-Drug Abuse Act certification. (MM Ex. 7; Tr. 64). Nearly a
month later, Cavan filed an executed Anti-Drug Abuse Act certification.
Consistent with his practice, Monahan obtained a date-stamped copy of the
certification and accompanying transmittal letter, dated August 20, 1992,
demonstrating that the correspondence had been properly filed with the Office of
the Secretary of the Commission. (MM Ex. 8; Tr. 64-65). In response to a
subsequent informal request by the Commission staff, Cavan tendered a copy of the
same certification on October 23, 1992. Consistent with his practice, Monahan
obtained a date-stamped copy of the October 23, 1992, submission, demonstrating
that it had been properly filed with the Office of the Secretary of the
Commission. (MM Ex. 9; Tr. 66). One week later, on October 30, 1992, the
Commission granted Cavan further authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent. The
station's silent authority extended to January 30, 1993. (MM Ex. 10; Tr. 67).

          12.  On January 30, 1993, Cavan's  authority for WTMS(AM) to remain
silent expired. Cavan did not submit a request for further silent authority by
that date. Three weeks later, by letter dated February 18, 1993, the Commission
advised Cavan that WTMS(AM) was off the air without authority. The Commission's
letter required Cavan to submit a written response within 30 days informing the
Commission of the status of WTMS(AM). (MM Ex. 11).

          13.  Cavan did not respond to the Commission letter of inquiry within
30 days. However, on March 22, 1993, Cavan filed its fourth request for authority
to keep WTMS(AM) silent. As was his practice, Monahan obtained a date-stamped
copy of the correspondence demonstrating that it had been filed with the Office
of the Secretary of the Commission. (MM Ex. 12; Tr. 69) Approximately one week
later, by letter dated March 30, 1993, the Commission granted Cavan request for
authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent. Cavan was authorized to keep WTMS(AM)
dark through June 30, 1993. (MM Ex. 13; Tr. 69).

          14.  On June 30, 1993, Cavan's  authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent
expired. Cavan did not request further silent authority by that date. Nearly one
month later, by letter to Monahan dated July 26, 1993, the Commission informed
Cavan that WTMS(AM) was off the air without authority.  The Commission's  letter
required Cavan to file a written response within 30 days informing the Commission
of the status of WTMS(AM). (MM Ex. 14; Tr. 70).

          15.  Commission records do not reveal that Cavan filed a response to
the July 26, 1993, letter of inquiry. Although Monahan claims that he transmitted
to the Commission a fifth request for silent authority on August 26, 1993,
Monahan did not obtain (and consequently Cavan was unable to produce at hearing)
a date-stamped copy of any such filing with the Commission. (Cavan Ex. 1,
Attachment J; Tr. 71). Furthermore, the Commission never acknowledged receiving
a further request for silent authority from Cavan; no further authority was ever
granted, and, despite the passage of several months without any action, at no
time subsequent to August 26, 1993 did Monahan inquire of the Commission's  staff
about the status of Cavan's  purported request. (Tr. 64-75). Monahan learned that
the Commission had commenced this proceeding to revoke Cavan's license for
WTMS(AM) shortly after the Show Cause Order was released on November 30, 1993.
(Tr. 75).

          16.  Upon release of the Show Cause Order, Cavan made the decision
to take all actions necessary to return WTMS(AM) to the air as soon as possible.
Repairs were made at a cost of approximately $13,000. (Tr. 88). Within four
months, on March 18, 1994, WTMS(AM) commenced broadcasting pursuant to Special
Temporary Authority. (MM Exs. 16 and 17; Tr. 81). On March 22, 1994, Cavan filed
its required application on FCC Form 302.  (MM Ex. 18; Tr. 85).

          17.  On March 23, 1994, Cavan entered into a Local Marketing
Agreement ("LMA") with Lobster Radio Network, Inc. ("Lobster"). The LMA permits
Lobster to operate WTMS(AM) on behalf of Cavan until such time as: (a) either
party terminates the contract upon 90-days written notice to the other; (b) both
parties terminate the contract by mutual written agreement; (c) Lobster purchases
the station from Cavan; or (d) the contract is determined to be illegal or in
violation of the Commission's  Rules or the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended. (Cavan Ex. 1, Attachment K). 

          18.  Although WTMS(AM) has a main studio with program origination
capability, the station is presently broadcasting programming which is produced
in, and delivered by satellite from, Florida by a company called International
Broadcast Network ("IBN"). IBN provided its programming to WTMS(AM) pursuant to
a written contract with Lobster. Monahan has never seen, and is unfamiliar with,
the terms of IBN's  contract with Lobster.  Furthermore, Monahan is unaware of
how long WTMS(AM) will continue to broadcast IBN programming. (Tr. 91-94).

          19.  Cavan does not have a written operating budget for WTMS(AM). Tr.
97-98). Nor does Cavan have any contingency plans for operating the station in
the event the LMA with Lobster is terminated. If, for any reason, the LMA is
terminated, Cavan would be unable financially to operate the station without an
immediate infusion of money from Cavan shareholders. (Tr. 103-104).
          
          20.  Cavan has experienced severe financial hardship since it
acquired WTMS(AM) and WTMS-FM in 1987; the company reported a net income of
$5,553 in the year ending December 31, 1993. The company has not prepared any
projected financial statements for the 1994 fiscal year. (Cavan Ex. 1, Attachment
N; Tr. 107).
                          III. Conclusions of Law
     
                         A. Section 73.1740 Issue

        Section 73,1740(a)(4) of the Commission's  Rules provides:

     In the event that causes beyond the control of a licensee make it
     impossible to adhere to the operating schedule of this section or to
     continue operating, the station may limit or discontinue operation
     for a period of not more than 30 days without further authority from
     the FCC. Notification must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C.,
     not later than the 10th day of limited or discontinued operation. 
     During such period, the licensee shall continue to adhere to the
     requirements in the station license pertaining to the lighting of
     antenna structures.  In the event normal operation is restored prior
     to the expiration of the 30 day period, the licensee will so notify
     the FCC of this date.  If the causes beyond the control of the
     licensee make it impossible to comply within the allowed period,
     informal written request shall be made to the FCC no later than the
     30th day for such additional time as may be deemed necessary. 

          21.  Cavan has violated 73.1740 of the Commission's Rules on several
occasions since 1991. Station WTMS(AM) initially went off the air on or about
March 29, 1991. However, it was not until May 17, 1991 -- nearly two months later
-- that Cavan sought authority from the Commission to keep WTMS(AM) silent. Since
Cavan was required by  73.1740 to submit its request for silent authority within
30 days of the date on which the station first went silent, and Cavan waited
nearly twice that long to do so, it is concluded that Cavan violated 73.1740 of
the Commission's  Rules in May  1991 by failing to seek in a timely manner
Commission authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent.

          22.  Cavan violated 73.1740 a second time during the period from
August 1991 to April 1992. The evidence is that on May 23, 1991, the Commission
granted Cavan's  initial request for authority to keep WTMS(AM) off the air, and
that such authority expired on August 23, 1991. Cavan, however, did not request
further silent authority until March 11, 1992, and the Commission did not grant
such further authority until April 10, 1992.  Since WTMS(AM) was off the air
without Commission authority during the entire period from August 23, 1991,
through April 10, 1992, and 73.1740 required Cavan to obtain Commission
authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent during that period, it is concluded that Cavan
violated 73.1740 for approximately eight continuous months by keeping WTMS(AM)
silent without authority.

          23. Cavan violated 73.1740 a third time during the months of
February and March 1993. The evidence shows that on October 30, 1992, the
Commission granted Cavan further authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent through
January 30, 1993. However, Cavan did not request any additional authority for
WTMS(AM) to remain silent until March 22, 1993.  Moreover, the Commission did not
grant Cavan's  request for additional time to keep WTMS(AM) off the air until
March 30, 1993.  Since WTMS(AM) was off the air without Commission authority from
January 30, 1993, until March 30, 1993, and 73.1740 required Cavan to obtain
Commission authority in order to keep WTMS(AM) silent during that period, it is
concluded that Cavan violated 73.1740 again, this time for two continuous months
during which time the station was silent without authority.

          24.  Cavan's  fourth and most recent violation of 73.1740 occurred
between June 1993 and March 1994. The record evidence reveals that on March 30,
1993, the Commission granted Cavan further authority to keep WTMS(AM) silent
through June 30, 1993. After that authority expired, however, Cavan failed to
request any additional authority for WTMS(AM) to remain silent. The station
returned to the air on March 18, 1994.  Since WTMS(AM) was off the air without
Commission authority from June 30, 1993, until the station returned to the air
on March 19, 1994, and 73.1740 required Cavan to obtain Commission authority in
order to keep WTMS(AM) silent during that period, it is concluded that Cavan
violated 73.1740 yet again, this time for nine continuous months during which
the station was silent without Commission authorization.  

          25.  Evidence concerning all of Cavan violations of 73.1740 is
relevant despite the fact that the Show Cause Order makes specific reference only
to Cavan's  most recent transgression of that rule section.  Show Cause Order,
at 2-3.  "It is well established that evidence relevant to the designated issues
should not be excluded 'merely because it was not included among the specific
instances which warranted the hearing.'"  Clay Frank Huntington, 61 FCC 2d 123,
124 (Rev. Bd. 1976), citing, Chronicle Broadcasting Co., 20 FCC 2d 33, 39 (1969);
Belk Broadcasting Co. of Florida, Inc., 27 FCC 2d 921 (Rev. Bd. 1971); WPIX,
Inc., 25 FCC 2d 678 (Rev. Bd. 1970).  Moreover, the Show Cause Order specifically
contemplated that evidence of Cavan's other, prior violations of 73.1740 should
be considered.  The Show Cause Order, at 7, directed the Presiding Judge to
determine whether to issue an Order of Forfeiture against Cavan for its willful
and/or  "repeated"  violation of 73.1740. It would render the reference to 
"repeated"  superfluous if the only evidence that could be considered was
evidence involving Cavan's single most recent violation of 73.1740. Furthermore,
evidence of Cavan's multiple violations of 73.1740 is relevant to determining
the extent of any forfeiture directed against Cavan.




     
B. Section 73.1750 Issue

           Section 73.1750 of the Commission's  Rules provides:

     The licensee of each station shall notify the FCC in Washington,
     D.C. of  permanent discontinuance of operation at least two days
     before operation  is discontinued.  Immediately after discontinuance
     of operation, the licensee shall forward the station license and
     other instruments of authorization to the FCC, Washington, D.C. for
     cancellation.

          26.  The issue as to whether Cavan violated 73.1750 is resolved in
Cavan's  favor.  Although the station was off the air for some two years, the
evidence plainly reveals that WTMS(AM) has commenced broadcasting again. Indeed,
Cavan obtained Special Temporary Authority to return WTMS(AM) to the air, and the
licensee has filed an application on FCC Form 302, as required by the Commission.
The question as to whether Cavan permanently discontinued operating WTMS(AM) is
adequately answered by the fact that Cavan has taken all necessary steps to make
the station operational again.

C. Resumption of Operation Issue

          27. Cavan does have the capability and intent to expeditiously resume
broadcast operations of WTMS(AM) consistent with the Commission's  Rules.
Cavan has managed to return WTMS(AM) to the air on what appears to be a long-term
basis. Cavan obtained Special Temporary Authority prior to commencing broadcast
operations, and it has filed an application on FCC Form 302.  Furthermore, Cavan
has entered into a Local Marketing Agreement with a company that itself has
contracted for the broadcast of syndicated programming.  Based on the foregoing,
the issue as to whether Cavan has the capability and intent to expeditiously
resume broadcast operations of WTMS(AM) will be resolved in Cavan favor.   
     
                         IV. Ultimate Conclusions 

          28.  The ultimate question to be decided in this proceeding is
whether, on the basis of the evidence adduced at hearing, Cavan's license to
operate WTMS(AM) should be revoked.  It is concluded that Cavan has the
capability and intent to expeditiously resume broadcast operations of WTMS(AM)
consistent with the Commission's  Rules.  Furthermore, it is concluded that Cavan
has not violated 73.1750 of the Commission's  Rules.  However, the facts plainly
demonstrate that Cavan has repeatedly violated 73.1740 of the Commission's
Rules. Nevertheless, license revocation is not warranted for these
transgressions.

          29.  The Show Cause Order, at 7, directed that, if it is determined
that revocation of the WTMS(AM) license is not warranted, the Presiding Judge
shall determine, pursuant to 503(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, whether to issue an Order of Forfeiture against Cavan in an amount not
to exceed $250,000 for the willful and/or repeated violation of 73.1740 and/or 
73.1740 of the Commission's  Rules.

          30.  Cavan has repeatedly violated 73.1740 of the Commission's 
Rules, and the violations are wholly inexcusable. However, given Cavan's
difficult financial condition, the imposition of a substantial forfeiture could
have a decidedly negative impact on the ability of the company to continue
operating both its AM and FM stations in Presque Isle, Maine.  It is concluded
that the public interest will be served by the imposition of a forfeiture in the
amount of $1,000.00.



          
          31.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT Cavan Communications Corporation
forfeit to the United States the sum of $1,000.00 for its repeated violations of
Section 73.1740 of the Commission's  Rules. /
