						Re:	ROB ALLEN HAUSER
							Request for Refund of Upfront Payment
							For MX Group FM 130 in Closed Broadcast 
							Auction No. 25


Dear Mr. Monahan:

This letter is in response to your Request for Refund of Upfront Payment ("Request") filed April 
20, 2000, on behalf of Mr. Rob Allen Hauser, the winning bidder in MX Group FM 130 in the Closed 
Broadcast Auction No. 25.  For the reasons set forth below, we deny your Request.

The Commission received three mutually exclusive long-form applications for construction 
permits for MX Group FM 130 - FM Channel 249A at Pullman, Washington.  Those applications were 
filed by Radio Palouse, Inc. ("Radio Palouse"), Lamonica Media, LLC ("Lamonica Media"), and Mr. 
Hauser.  The Mass Media Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issued a Public Notice  
on July 9, 1999 announcing that these applicants would be eligible to participate in an auction to begin 
on September 28, 1999. 

The July 9th Public Notice stated that, in order to participate in the auction, all applicants would 
have to submit a FCC Form 175 (short-form application) by the deadline of August 20, 1999.   The 
Broadcast First Report & Order stated that if only one acceptable short-form application was received 
for a particular construction permit, the auction would be cancelled for that construction permit.   The 
July 9th Public Notice also stated that "if an applicant were to submit a short-form application but fail to 
timely tender an upfront payment, it would retain its place in the MX Group but, having purchased no 
bidding eligibility, would not be eligible to bid."   It further stated that if " . . . two or more parties file 
short-form applications in their MX Group, but only one submits an upfront payment, mutual exclusivity 
would exist for auction purposes (since multiple short-form applications are tendered) and, in such case, 
the party making its upfront payment is not entitled to both a refund and the grant of a construction 
permit." 

In this case, short-form applications were submitted by Mr. Hauser, Radio Palouse, and 
Lamonica Media.  Subsequently, the auction staff issued a Public Notice  on September 3, 1999 
accepting for filing Mr. Hauser's short-form application and listing as incomplete the short-form 
applications of Radio Palouse and Lamonica Media.  The September 3rd Public Notice stated that 
applicants with incomplete short-form applications could become qualified to bid in the auction only if 
they made the required upfront payment by 6:00 p.m. on Monday September 13, 1999, and resubmitted 
complete applications by 5:30 p.m. on September 14, 1999.  Radio Palouse did not resubmit its short-
form application before the deadline.   Lamonica Media did resubmit its short-form application before 
the deadline.   Thus for MX Group FM 130, the Commission received two acceptable short-form 
applications, one from Mr. Hauser and the other from Lamonica Media.  However, Lamonica Media 
failed to submit an upfront payment and therefore, Lamonica Media was not qualified to bid in the 
auction. 

In the first round of bidding for Auction No. 25, Mr. Hauser placed the minimum opening bid 
equal to his upfront payment ($25,000) on FM Channel 249A, Pullman, Washington.  As the highest and 
only bidder in MX Group FM 130, Mr. Hauser was awarded the license.    In his Request, Mr. Hauser 
argues that because he was the only qualified bidder for the construction permit for Channel 249A at 
Pullman, Washington, the Commission was precluded from assigning the permit through competitive 
bidding. 

Section 309(j) of the Communications Act requires the Commission to assign any initial license 
or construction permit through an auction when mutually exclusive short-form applications are accepted 
for filing.   In other words, if the Commission has received more than one acceptable short-form 
application for the same license or construction permit, the statute requires that the Commission conduct 
an auction.  The Commission received two acceptable, mutually exclusive short-form applications for a 
construction permit for channel 249A at Pullman, Washington: one from Mr. Hauser and one from 
Lamonica Media.  In light of these competing short-form applications for the same license, the 
Commission was required to assign the license through an auction.   The factual circumstances present 
in this case were clearly addressed in the July 9th Public Notice.  Because both Mr. Hauser and Lamonica 
Media submitted acceptable short-form applications, mutual exclusivity existed, regardless of the fact 
that Lamonica Media did not purchase bidding eligibility by timely tendering an upfront payment. 

Mr. Hauser argues that a statement in the Broadcast MO&O supports his Request.  Specifically, 
Mr. Hauser relies on the statement that the Commission would ". . .conduct competitive bidding for any 
broadcast permit only where competing applicants have submitted acceptable short-form applications for 
any broadcast permit and have been found qualified to bid."   This statement is taken out of context.  In 
the Broadcast MO&O, the Commission considered and rejected a suggestion to adopt a "post-auction" 
evidentiary procedure to determine whether a winning bidder was the sole qualified applicant and 
therefore entitled to a grant of license without remittance of its winning bid.   In the context of rejecting 
this "post-auction" procedure, the Commission stated that because all prospective bidders were found 
qualified to bid before being allowed to participate in an auction it was unnecessary and redundant to 
adopt a "post-auction" procedure.   In this sentence, the Commission was not addressing the 
determination of mutual exclusivity because mutual exclusivity is a "pre-auction" determination.  Thus, 
the cited language is not useful in a discussion of mutual exclusivity, and does not alter the 
Commission's statutory obligation to use competitive bidding.

Mr. Hauser's Request is an untimely attempt to revise the rules after the auction has been 
conducted.   The July 9th Public Notice anticipated and clearly addressed the factual circumstances that 
developed for MX Group FM 130.   All of the bidders in Auction No. 25, including Mr. Hauser, had 
notice of the auction procedures that would apply.  Because acceptable, mutually exclusive short-form 
applications for FM Channel 249A at Pullman, Washington were filed, Mr. Hauser has failed to establish 
that a refund would be appropriate.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that the Request for Refund of Upfront Payment filed by Rob 
Allen Hauser, IS DENIED.
