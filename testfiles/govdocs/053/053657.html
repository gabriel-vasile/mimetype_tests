        Trail follows the San Joaquin River and parallels or follows various historic

        Editorial: &quot;Ranchers benefit from the ability to let their livestock 
        graze on federally owned land -- while taxpayers eat a financial loss. 
        Congress needs to change that inequity. A report released last week says 
        grazing on federal land cost taxpayers $123 million last year, even though 
        the government charges for grazing privileges. Livestock graze on 235 
        million acres of federal land, including ranges in Barstow and Needles.&quot;</font></p>

        &quot;The season's first storm brought scattered rain to the Central Valley

        to firefighting officials, who announced the end of a surprisingly uneventful

        Ken Hood, fire and fuels division chief for the federal Bureau of Land

&quot;Critics ranging from environmentalists to hunters are denouncing a mining proposal tucked in a massive budget bill as a push to sell tens of millions of acres of public land in the West to the highest bidder and gut environmental reviews of oil and gas drilling and other development. The provisions in the bill by the House Resources Committee are aimed at updating the 1872 mining law, long criticized for selling off federal lands in some of the country's most scenic areas for rock-bottom prices: $2.50 to $5 an acre. However opponents say the language of the new bill is so loose that anybody with the money can stake a mining claim and buy the land without having to actually mine it.&quot;<br>
