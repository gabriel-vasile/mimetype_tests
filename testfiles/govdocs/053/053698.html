Immediatelyafter the bridge was mapped and made a monument, members of theCummings/Douglass expedition were embroiled in arguments over whichwhite man saw the bridge first and which Paiute guide actually knew theway to the bridge. But the significance of Rainbow Bridge to certainNative American groups also became the subject of controversy. Given thehistoric presence of Native Americans near Rainbow Bridge, it was only amatter of time before the interests of Indian groups clashed with theinterests of the monument's federal managers. While many peoples, suchas the Hopi and the San Juan Paiute, considered Rainbow Bridge importantto their origin stories, the most strenuous claims to the bridge'ssacred status have been made by the Navajo Nation. These claims wereeventually part of litigation that affected the way the National ParkService currently manages the monument. This chapter will detail theNavajo origin story as it pertains to Rainbow Bridge and identify therelationship between those beliefs and various lawsuits filed by theNavajo Nation to protect them. In addition, this chapter will explorethe outcome of those lawsuits as pertains to NPS management policy atRainbow Bridge.</P><P>While Anglo culture appreciated Rainbow Bridge for its aestheticbeauty and geologic uniqueness, Navajos have identified Rainbow Bridgeas a sacred, religious site. They believe it is integral to the story oftheir emergence into this world. The ingress of Native American peoplesto the Rainbow Bridge area provides some of the data to support Navajoclaims to cultural and historical preeminence in the region. The hearthlocated at the foot of the bridge, excavated by Park Servicearcheologists in 1994, suggests a definite and early Native Americanawareness of the bridge. The non-secular cultural characteristics ofthese ancestral Puebloans also allows contemporary scholars to at leastargue that the bridge was a source of worship during the last 1,500years. But the incorporation of Rainbow Bridge in Navajo religiousbeliefs is more readily documented than suppositions concerningancestral Puebloans. One of the problems associated with examining thissubject is the set of academic standards in place that mitigates theveracity of Navajo claims on Rainbow Bridge. Too many historians demanda degree of quantitative proof that cultures who rely on oral traditioncannot provide. Neil Judd's comments in 1924 regarding the doublestandard of Anglo history were especially prescient with respect toNavajo religious claims on Rainbow Bridge.</P><P>Unfortunately, quantitative standards for proof do not mesh easilywith the qualitative study of Native American religion. To understandthe Navajo conception of the religious and cultural significance ofRainbow Bridge, one must make use of different conceptions about whatmerits belief and about what constitutes a legitimate belief structure.This is less problematic when coupled to the physical evidence thatverifies a long-standing Navajo cultural tradition at Rainbow Bridge.That evidence includes detailed oral histories that document a patternof religious belief involving the bridge; detailed descriptions of aprimitive altar at the base of Rainbow Bridge prior to 1930; and,physical evidence of early Navajo existence in the region. What isimportant to remember is that one need not agree with the tradition thatinvolves Rainbow Bridge religion in order for that tradition to havemerit to Navajos. Their beliefs are as circumambient to them as the airthey breath.</P><P>Part of the larger Navajo origin story includes the importance of thefour sacred mountains. When First Man (&Aacute;lts&eacute; Hastiin) andFirst Woman (&Aacute;lts&eacute; Asdz&aacute;&aacute;) emerged into theFourth World they created the four sacred mountains. After the firstfour Navajo clans emerged from a subsequent global flood, they movedinto the area bounded by these four mountains. This was the originalDin&eacute;tah (Navajo country). Those mountains are recognized today asSan Francisco Peak, Gobernador Peak, Mount Taylor, and Mount Blanca.Some scholars argue that the Navajo origin story reveals much about theontology of the Navajo people. The importance of place and therelationship of place to spirituality is evidenced in the four sacredmountains. The full account of the origin story reveals dozens ofplace-specific episodes that can be recognized in modern geography.Every nation, the Navajo included, has found tremendous nationalistspirit in places and place-specific events. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#203">203</A>] The Navajo belief structure is one thatcannot be separated from the natural world. Mountains, water, andvarious natural features imbue their religion just as edifices andgeographies underpin Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Navajo originstory also informs their value structure and social organization. It isnot hard to discern the Navajo desire for order and their devotion toclan-based politics from their story of the world's beginning. The factthat Navajos pray to certain gods and assign importance to the locationin which those prayers take place only evidences their dedication topolytheism in the face of other people's commitment to monotheism. Itcertainly does not mitigate their value structure on a comparativelevel; after all, much of the world's current population ispolytheistic.</P><P>For this administrative history, oral interviews with residents ofthe Navajo Mountain community were conducted to elaborate on the role ofRainbow Bridge in the origin story. These interviews revealed much ofthe common belief in Rainbow Bridge as an instrument of spirituality andreligious significance. Most of the interviewees had lived in the NavajoMountain/Rainbow Bridge area their entire lives, as had their parentsand grandparents. The stories they shared form the basis of thetraditional origin story detailed below. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#204">204</A>] In this account, the first people wereborn in the Black world, home to spirits and holy men.&Aacute;lts&eacute; Hastiin (First Man) was born in the east out of aunion between the white cloud and the black cloud. Born with him was DooHonoot'&iacute;nii (the first seed corn). In the west, yellow cloud andblue cloud met and made &Aacute;lts&eacute; Asdz&aacute;&aacute; (FirstWoman). She arrived with yellow corn, white shell, and turquoise.Cooperation was a virtue in the Black World, demonstrated by InsectBeings. Other beings also lived in the Black World, including WaspPeople, Bat People, Ant People, and Spider Woman. But infighting andbickering led all these beings to move up to the Blue World. Theycarried with them all the evils of the Black World.</P><P>In the Blue World, beings from the Black World found new beings,including large insects, feathered beings, wolves, and mountain lions.After much quarreling, &Aacute;lts&eacute; Hastiin conducted ritualprayers and feasts so all the beings could proceed to the Yellow World.In the Yellow World, there were six mountains and no sun. The originaltravelers also discovered snakes, squirrels, and deer. Unfortunately,Coyote came to this world with &Aacute;lts&eacute; Hastiin and&Aacute;lts&eacute; Asdz&aacute;&aacute;. In the Yellow World, Coyotecaused problems. The inhabitants of this world watched as the cloudsbegan to gather, first in the east, then the south, west, and north. Theclouds came together and rain began to fall. The water rose all aroundthem. They knew they must escape to the Fourth World to avoid drowning.They planted many different tree species, hoping one would grow tallenough for them to climb up and escape the flood. After each tree provedtoo short, they planted a giant reed, which grew into the heavens.Locust volunteered to lead the group to safety. They moved up the hollowcore of the reed to safety.</P><P>Unfortunately, Coyote decided to cause mischief during the escape. AsCoyote watched the rising water, he noticed the child ofT&eacute;&eacute;hoolts&oacute;dii (Water Monster). Coyote decided hewanted to keep the child and raise it as his own. He took the child andhid him from T&eacute;&eacute;hoolts&oacute;dii. In response,T&eacute;&eacute;hoolts&oacute;dii made the waters rise up the reedbehind the group, which threatened to drown everyone. The group pleadedwith Coyote to give the child back toT&eacute;&eacute;hoolts&oacute;dii. After pleading with Coyote fourtimes, Coyote released the child. To appease Water Baby's parents, thegroup made offerings to T&eacute;&eacute;hoolts&oacute;dii and the waterreceded enough for the group to escape. At this time, the GlitteringWorld was inhabited by gods and spirits. There were no humans. Locustsurveyed the land after emergence and found it covered with water. BigHorn Sheep dug canyons with his horns so the water could escape to theocean. This is how canyons were formed. Locust then decided that firesshould be lit so the gods would know of the group's presence. It was inthis world that the first sweat bath was taken and the first hogan wasbuilt. The stars were placed in the great sky. In the Glittering Worlddeveloped the seasons and the harvest. When the first emergents spiedNavajo Mountain in the distance, they regarded it as the Head of theEarth.</P><P>It was at this point that two of the most important figures in Navajoreligion appeared: the Hero Twins. After the first fires were lit,&Aacute;lts&eacute; Hastiin and &Aacute;lts&eacute; Asdz&aacute;&aacute;noticed tracks that led to the west. Part of the group decided to followthe tracks. The tracks were left by White Shell Woman's children, bornto her after the Sun committed adultery with her before the emergence.These children are known to the Navajo as the Hero Twins:Naay&eacute;&eacute;' Neizgh&acute;n&iacute; (Monster Slayer) andT&ocaute; Baj&icaute;sh Chini (Born For Water). To travel to the westernoceans and visit White Shell Woman, the group used rainbows to covergreat distances. As the group proceeded west, they encountered the manymonsters and evil spirits that were byproducts of the Sun's adultery.After visiting White Shell Woman in the west, the group returned withthe Hero Twins, hoping they would grow up to battle the monsters andevil spirits.</P><P>Once they had returned to the Navajo Mountain area, holy men from thegroup placed the magic rainbow in the safest place they could: BridgeCanyon, below Navajo Mountain. The rainbow then turned to stone. MonsterSlayer and Born For Water were raised in the cradle of Bridge Creek andthe stone rainbow formed the protective handle of their cradle board.After they reached maturity, and discovered the Sun was their father,they traveled to visit him. They used the rock rainbow to ease theirjourney. The Sun tested his sons thoroughly during their trip andrewarded each of them with a weapon so they could battle the monsters.To Monster Slayer the Sun gave Lightning That Strikes Crooked. Born ForWater received Lightning That Flashes Straight. The twins returned homeand defeated most of the monsters. The monsters that were allowed tosurvive personified old age, lice, hunger, and death.</P><P>Monster Slayer and Born For Water went again to visit with the Sun.This time, the Sun gave them gifts from the four directions. In exchangefor giving them these gifts, the Sun received the ability to destroy allbeings who lived in houses. This was very important as many of thesurviving monsters were children of the Sun. The Sun precipitated animmense flood which covered the earth and destroyed most living things.The Holy People saved one man and one woman and pairs of all theanimals. In the wake of the flood, Asdz&aacute;&aacute;N&aacute;dleeh&eacute; (Changing Woman) established the first fourclans: Kiiyaa'&aacute;anii (Towering House), Hon&aacute;gh&aacute;ahnii(One Who walks Around You), T&oacute; D&iacute;ch'&iacute;i'nii (BitterWater), and Hashtl'ishnii (Mud). The four clans settled inside the areabounded by the four scared mountains.</P><P>All of the residents of the Navajo Mountain community interviewed forthis administrative history detailed the same origin story. The onlydeviations that occurred were in the minute details that somerespondents were hesitant to reveal. These people consider those detailspart of their identity as a people and therefore not open to publicconsumption. The Navajo are still very much an oral culture. The lessonscontained in the entire origin story are meant to serve as lessons forNavajo children. What specific substances were offered to which gods orthe details of various ceremonies are told from Navajo parents andgrandparents to Navajo youth, not to whites or other interested parties.The Navajos interviewed for this history spoke often about culturalownership and identity regarding their stories. But Anglomisunderstanding of Navajo life ways has a long history.</P><P>The clan-based Navajo socio-political structure was at odds withAnglo (mis)conceptions of Native Americans at least as early as the 19thcentury. Navajo tribal historian Bill Acrey, tracing the development ofthe modern Navajo nation, found that the initial contact between Anglosand the Din&eacute; was laden with the classic repugnance of Angloattempts to mold Navajos into yeoman farmers. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#205">205</A>] In the period between 1846 and 1860 therewere more than five separate treaties of peace, all initiated by UnitedStates military commanders in response to livestock and slave raidingconducted by the Din&eacute;. Each of these treaties contained someprovision which demanded Navajos stop raiding and embrace the farmingethic of the expanding United States. The lack of cultural understandingon the part of military personnel led to the demise of every treaty. Forexample, the Treaty of Ojo del Oso in 1848 forbade the Din&eacute; fromraiding into New Mexico settlements because the United States was nolonger at war with the Mexicans. This made no sense to Din&eacute;leaders because the Din&eacute; believed that an enemy was always anenemy regardless of political climate. American treaty negotiatorscontinually made the assumption that there was some central form ofleadership among the Din&eacute;. American military personnel assumedthat those Din&eacute; leaders who signed the various treatiesrepresented all the Din&eacute;. Nothing could have been further fromthe truth. The Din&eacute; signatories knew that they only representedtheir individual bands and that those bands not represented in signatureon the treaty would never abide by its terms. These were just a few ofthe cultural misunderstandings that occurred between 1846 and 1860.</P><P>In 1863, the enmity that had formed between the Din&eacute; and theU.S. military culminated in the Bosque Redondo War and the militarydefeat of the Din&eacute;. Leading a scorched earth campaign, Kit Carsonbrought the Din&eacute; to their knees by late 1863. At that point, allthe Din&eacute; that could be rounded up were marched through the wintermonths and incarcerated at the Bosque Redondo reservation, located atthe newly erected Fort Sumner. The Din&eacute; endured four years ofstarvation and disease but persevered to a palatable solution. In 1868,the Din&eacute; successfully negotiated the Treaty of Bosque Redondo andwere allowed to return to their ancestral homelands. The red rock mesasand canyons that the Navajo returned to formed the original Navajoreservation. In addition, the treaty stipulated that livestock would bereturned to the Din&eacute;. As a result of both perseverance andexcellent husbandry techniques, Navajo and livestock populationsincreased every year after the incarceration at Fort Sumner.</P><P>In every region of the Navajo Nation's current geography, the originstory has its permutations. To the western Navajo, Rainbow Bridge andNavajo Mountain are an integral part of the origin story. Both locationsare also key elements in various ceremonies conducted by Navajo singersor medicine men. There have been numerous attempts to document the roleof Rainbow Bridge in Navajo religious belief. In the early 1970s, whenLake Powell waters started encroaching on the bridge, a group of Navajosingers filed suit to protect their religious freedom. The specificclaims of that suit are dealt with later in this chapter. As a result ofthe suit, however, a stunning piece of oral history was collected. In aneffort to put into writing what had long been oral culture and custom, agroup of Navajo singers provided their oral histories to Karl W.Luckert, an ethnohistorian from the Museum of Northern Arizona. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#206">206</A>] The result was a sincere attempt to dojustice to the Navajo tradition involving Rainbow Bridge in a form thatnon-Navajos would see as legitimate.</P><P>Like most ethnohistorians, Luckert tried to place the religioussignificance of Rainbow Bridge and Navajo Mountain in the properhistorical context. For many of the Navajo singers interviewed as partof Luckert's project, Rainbow Bridge and Navajo Mountain were consideredsanctuary from the ravages of Kit Carson's campaign against theDin&eacute;. At the time, many Navajos still held fresh memories oftribal experiences with the United States military and of theincarceration at Fort Sumner. But there were many Navajos who eludedCarson and avoided Fort Sumner altogether. Those Navajos hid in thenumerous canyons of northern New Mexico and southern Utah. In additionto the role of the bridge in Navajo emergence, the added element ofsanctuary endeared both Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge tocontemporary Navajos. It was in those terms that Luckert's intervieweesfigured Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge as key fixtures in the storyof Monster Slayer. The Navajo people refer to their sacred mountain inthe northwest of their reservation not as "Navajo" Mountain but asNaatsis'&aacute;&aacute;n (Earth Head). [<AHREF="adhie.htm#207">207</A>]</P><P>In the oral histories collected by Luckert, all the interviewees toldbasically the same story with regard to Navajo Mountain and RainbowBridge as those stories collected in 2000 for this administrativehistory. The origin story that was taught to Navajo singers includedNavajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge. That story also included the moderndetails of a group of Navajos attempting to evade the United Statesmilitary. Fleeing Navajos perceived the fortuitous location of NavajoMountain as a sign that their gods were watching over them. Theyperceived the canyons of the region to be gifts from Head of Earth.Whatever their motivations or proclivities, the fact is that all Navajosingers interviewed by Luckert couched their origin story in thebenevolence of Navajo Mountain and the peculiar beauty of RainbowBridge. Each interviewee recalled in some form that in the days whenhumankind was born, Monster Slayer was transferred and born and raisedin Bridge Canyon. When the Navajo were threatened, Monster Slayer(clothed in an armor of flint) and the Head of the Earth placedthemselves as shields between the Navajo and Kit Carson. This eventstill echoes in the formalized Protectionway prayers of contemporarysingers. [<A HREF="adhie.htm#208">208</A>]</P><P>Dozens of ceremonies were and still are conducted at Rainbow Bridge.The most common ceremonies conducted there during the period ofLuckert's interviews were Protectionway, Blessingway, andrain-requesting. [<A HREF="adhie.htm#209">209</A>] In a 1974 affidavitfiled as part of a larger suit to remove Lake Powell waters from BridgeCanyon, Navajo singer Nakai Ditloi recounted the tradition of NavajoMountain and Rainbow Bridge:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have conducted countless religious ceremonies and sings throughoutthe area surrounding Rainbow Bridge and Navajo Mountain. Rainbow Bridgeis extremely sacred to the Din&eacute;, as are many of the sites andmuch of the area surrounding the Bridge. The water from the lake hasalready entered the Canyon of the Rainbow Bridge and has covered thegrounds sacred to the Din&eacute;.</P><P>When the Din&eacute; were emerging from the east they stopped at alarge mesa near Navajo Mountain to make a home on the mountain forLageinayal. He is the god who was given lightning to create rain. Hisname means "came into being one day." In gratitude for his home onNavajo Mountain, Lageinayal promised to protect the Din&eacute; and lookafter their well being. Sometime later, a group of the Din&eacute; leftthis home with a god named Danaiize. He has the power to create and totravel on the rainbow. The Din&eacute; reached a canyon which they couldnot cross. Danaiize told them he would create a rock rainbow which wouldbe a bridge for the Din&eacute;. It was in this way that the Din&eacute;were able to cross the Canyon of the Rainbow Bridge. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#210">210</A>]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Much of this interpretation is confirmed in the oral historiescollected by Luckert. Floyd Laughter, another Navajo singer, recountedthat "the Rainbow was left for prayer and offerings to the power of theHoly People." This account was echoed by other interviewees as well. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#211">211</A>]</P><P>There was another common understanding among various intervieweesregarding Rainbow Bridge: the existence of a "sacred" spring below thebridge in Bridge Canyon. In 1974, Nakai Ditloi detailed for the courtshis recollections of the spring and the specific ceremonies that wereperformed there:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>There is a cave down the canyon from Rainbow Bridge. Medicine mencome from all over the reservation to meet in this cave. There is also asacred spring in the canyon near the cave. It is called "clear body maleand female water." Its water is used in the prayers and to wash thesacred bundles of the medicine man. Ground turquoise and shells aregiven to the spring to aid in the prayers from rain. Prayers are renewedand knowledge of the earth and the ways of the Din&eacute; is increasedwhen the medicine men come to the cave. [<AHREF="adhie.htm#212">212</A>]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>All of Luckert's interviewees confirmed the existence and location ofthis spring. Floyd Laughter also remembered the spring as where SpringPerson lived. It was located at the base of the slope of Rainbow Bridge.It was there that singers said prayers for wealth, for livestock, forjewelry. They also conducted raiding prayers and protectionwayceremonies at this sacred spring. [<A HREF="adhie.htm#213">213</A>] </P><P>The other detail that most Navajo singers agreed on was the identityof the Navajo man who first brought them, or their fathers, knowledge ofthe bridge. His name was &Aacute;shiih&iacute; bin &aacute;&aacute;'&aacute;din&iacute; (Old Blind Salt Clansman or OldHashk&eacute;niinii). This was the same man who told Louisa Wetherillabout the bridge in 1907. It was &Aacute;shiih&iacute; bin&aacute;&aacute;' &aacute;din&iacute; who helped many of the 20thcentury singers with the rites associated with Rainbow Bridge. The oneobvious problem with Luckert's interviews was the misconception thatNavajos did not arrive near Navajo Mountain until the 1860s, beingchased there by Carson. Nothing could have been further from the truth.Celone Dougi, &Aacute;shiih&iacute; bin &aacute;&aacute;'&aacute;din&iacute;'s granddaughter, was interviewed for thisadministrative history in 2000. She said that her grandfather had alwaysbeen here, along with many other Navajos. Most of the Navajos andPaiutes interviewed for this administrative history were able to recounta long lineage in the Navajo Mountain area, remembering relatives bornnear the mountain as far back as the 1820s. But what is important isthat most Navajo singers and other residents from the region credit&Aacute;shiih&iacute; bin &aacute;&aacute;' &aacute;din&iacute; withboth early knowledge of the bridge and its associated religious rites.[<A HREF="adhie.htm#214">214</A>]</P><P>It is unlikely that Navajos were the only people to find religioussignificance in the bridge. A fair argument can be made that earlyinhabitants of the region found the bridge and likely prayed there. Theexistence of the hearth excavated at the foot of the bridge (see chapter2), the proximity of ancestral Puebloan dwellings, and the number ofother pre-Puebloan sites a short distance from Bridge Canyon makes itlikely that early inhabitants of the region found the bridge. Besidesthe oral tradition of Navajo religious beliefs involving Rainbow Bridge,there is other, albeit limited, physical evidence of religious worshipat the bridge.</P><P>After the Cummings/Douglass expedition reached Rainbow Bridge onAugust 14, 1909, members of the party fanned out to explore theimmediate vicinity. Cummings observed a small "fire shrine in the shadowon the bench at one side." [<A HREF="adhie.htm#215">215</A>] The detailsof the location are important in their comparative value. Cummings'observation put the shrine on the north side of the bridge, which wouldhave been shadowed by a noon sun climbing into the sky above BridgeCanyon. Judd reported seeing the same shrine. He wrote that "near thedown-curving buttress, but slightly to one side, is a small heap ofstones inclosing a slab sided receptacle, the altar of cliff dwellingpeoples who roamed this canyon country long before the Navaho [sic] wonit for themselves." [<A HREF="adhie.htm#216">216</A>] William Douglassmade a similar note. He reported that "almost under the arch, on thenorth side of the gulch [was] the wall of some small prehistoricstructure in front of which slabs of sandstone set on edge outline anoval 3x5 feet&#151;an altar . . . ." [<A HREF="adhie.htm#217">217</A>]Temporal and cultural observations aside, the consistency in thesedescriptions allows some suppositions to be made regarding thenon-secular traits of early inhabitants of the region and thepossibility that they worshiped near the bridge. Before 1930, othertravelers to the bridge noted the stone altar as well. Notable amongthese visitors was Theodore Roosevelt. He described what he saw as "theruin of a very ancient shrine." [<A HREF="adhie.htm#218">218</A>] Itseems clear that before the 1930s, when someone or something destroyedthe altar-like structure, Rainbow Bridge was used as a worship site.</P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN="center" WIDTH="600"><TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="200" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>&lt;&lt;&lt; <A HREF="adhi4b.htm">Previous</A></B></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="center" WIDTH="200" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>&lt;&lt;&lt; <A HREF="adhit.htm">Contents</A> &gt;&gt;&gt;</B></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="right" WIDTH="200" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A HREF="adhi5a.htm">Next</A></B> &gt;&gt;&gt;</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><DIV><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="1">http://www.nps.gov/rabr/adhi/adhi5.htm<BR>Last Updated: 07-Feb-2003</FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
