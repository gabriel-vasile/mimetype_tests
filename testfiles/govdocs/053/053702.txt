Delegate to National Convention
Again I sing, and now my theme
Is not of surging, murmuring billows, Nor yet of flowers, and ladies fair,
Nor yet of waving, weeping willows. My lyre I tune, and now, once more,
I sweep the chords with trembling fingers, And strike a dirge, all grand and deep,
Which in my sad soul fondly lingers.
And from the vernal, sloping shore,
Where I stand rapt in meditation, My memory notes the troubled clouds
Which shrouded once our suffering Nation, When, yielding to his country's call,
In her dark hour of tribulation, (Sing softly, Muse, and do not wake her,
The infant under yon earth-mound) Up sprang to arms, met death and fell,
Our gallant, glorious, Colonel Baker.
The winds went sighing through the trees,
And white sails decked the foam-capped ocean, And San Francisco's busy hum
Was heard above the waves' commotion, And sea gulls in the craggy clefts,
Against whose feet wild waves were dashing, Cooed to their mates, who sought their food
Where breakers 'mong the rocks were crashing; And in my soul a quiet peace,
Composed of joy and pain and sorrow, Awoke me to the toil of life
And its demanding, stern to-morrow.
I turned, and sped me through the vales,
And o'er the frowning, snow-clad mountains,
Through broken wilds and desert plains,
O'er arid wastes, past gurgling fountains.
Lone Mountain still slept by the sea,_
While on I sped from hill-side Rincon, Till, past Oak Ridge's welcome gates,
I stopped, beside the tomb of Lincoln. The circumambient air was still;
The warm, spring day with Peace was laden, And trees and birds and flowers and bees
Sang welcome  to  their  blissful Aidenn.
I stood beside the monument
And gazed, enrapt, into the portal,
Where rests, all that belongs to earth, Of proud Columbia's son immortal;
