<p align="center"><center>PETITION FOR DECLARATORY ORDER--CERTAIN RATES AND

<p align="center"><center>PRACTICES OF SOUTH EAST CARRIERS, INC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><center>Decided:  March 13, 1998

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	South East Carriers, Inc. (SEAC), a motor common and contract carrier, is seeking
undercharges from Collective Distribution Systems (CDS) and Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro).  SEAC
seeks to collect the difference between the amount originally paid and the amount that it claims
should have been paid for its transportation service, plus attorneys' fees for collection.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The primary issue here is whether the transportation service provided by SEAC was
common or contract carriage.  If the service was common carriage, SEAC would have been
required by the filed rate doctrine, which was in effect at the time of the shipment, to charge and
collect the applicable common carrier tariff rate on file at the ICC.  If, on the other hand, SEAC's
service was contract carriage, the filed rate doctrine would not apply and the parties would be
bound by the contract rate.  For the reasons set forth below, we find that the service performed by
SEAC was contract carriage, and that no basis for collecting the charges claimed by SEAC under
the filed rate doctrine has been demonstrated.  Because we find that SEAC may not collect
charges under its tariff, we will not reach the other issues raised in this proceeding.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><center>BACKGROUND</center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	SEAC claims undercharges, detention charges, and attorneys' fees for services rendered
and expenses incurred in transporting one shipment in December 1993 from the Port of Seattle,
WA, to the facilities of consignee Target Distribution Center (Target) located in Indianapolis, IN. 
Arrangements for transporting the shipment were made by CDS, a licensed property broker 
acting on behalf of Hasbro, on December 1, 1993.  SEAC apparently agreed with CDS to
transport the Hasbro shipment at a flat rate of $2,000.  The shipment was delivered on
December 12, 1993, and SEAC submitted an invoice to CDS for the $2,000 negotiated rate. 
CDS did not pay the full invoiced charge, however, but sought to offset from the invoiced charge
the costs it allegedly incurred as a consequence of delayed delivery.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  CDS deducted $466.50 for
its claimed costs and remitted the balance of $1,533.50 to SEAC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	SEAC demanded that CDS and Hasbro pay the balance of $466.50, but CDS and Hasbro
refused.  SEAC then reassessed the freight charges for the subject movement based on its
common carrier tariffs.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  As a result, it increased its basic transportation charge to $2,484.90. 
After crediting the $1,533.50 already paid, SEAC demanded that CDS and Hasbro pay the
balance of $951.40.  SEAC also claims that CDS and Hasbro must pay detention charges of
$1,200.00<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and attorneys' fees of $752.99.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  The total amount SEAC seeks to collect is thus
$2,904.39.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On May 20, 1994, SEAC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Tennessee to collect the $2,904.39.  The court referred the matter to the ICC to
determine whether Hasbro's shipment moved under SEAC's common or contract carrier
authority.  The court also asked the ICC to determine whether the provisions of SEAC's tariffs
for detention charges and attorneys' fees are lawful and applicable, and whether SEAC's filed
rates are reasonable.  <u>South East Carriers, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc. and Collective Distribution
Services, Inc.</u>, Civil Action No. 1:94-0045-H (referral order dated August 1, 1994).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	By petition filed September 19, 1994, CDS and Hasbro asked the ICC to determine
whether the transportation service provided by SEAC was motor contract carriage.  In the
alternative, CDS and Hasbro asked the ICC to find that the published tariff rates SEAC seeks to
collect are unreasonable.  By order served January 20, 1995, the ICC instituted this proceeding
and set a procedural schedule.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Pursuant to the ICC's order, CDS and Hasbro filed opening statements on March 21,
1995, including verified statements and exhibits from Bram Friedman, CDS's O.S.&amp; D.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
manager, and David Samardak, Hasbro's contract negotiator.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
<p>  SEAC replied on April 20, 1995. 
CDS and Hasbro filed a rebuttal on May 22, 1995.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In support of the opening statement of CDS and Hasbro, Mr. Friedman testifies that CDS
and SEAC began their relationship in 1987, when SEAC provided CDS with a copy of its ICC
contract carrier authority.  He states that CDS made it clear to SEAC that it would only deal with
SEAC on a contract carrier basis because price flexibility was essential to CDS.  Mr. Friedman
asserts that between April 1992 and October 1993, CDS tendered 20 shipments to the carrier for
transportation under SEAC's contract carrier authority.  Allegedly, CDS and SEAC agreed on a
flat rate prior to each movement.  The flat rate and other terms were confirmed in an "Equipment
Contract &amp; Confirmation" telefaxed to SEAC, containing the following terms:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This confirmation is to serve as the "Contract to Haul" for transportation services. 
Receipt of this agreement constitutes acceptance . . . .  Each shipment tendered . . . to
Carrier on and after the date of this Confirmation shall be a tender to Carrier as a Motor
Contract Carrier and shall be subject only to the terms of each Confirmation and the
provisions of law applicable to Motor Contract Carriage.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Mr. Friedman asserts that CDS was contacted by Hasbro on December 1, 1993, to handle
the movement of the subject shipment from Seattle.  CDS then arranged for SEAC to transport
the shipment.  He states that a copy of the equipment contract was telefaxed to SEAC with the
details of the shipment, including the negotiated flat rate of $2,000.  A copy of the equipment
contract submitted by Mr. Friedman (Exhibit A) shows that Hasbro's shipment was scheduled to
be picked up on December 2 and delivered on December 6.  According to Mr. Friedman,
however, the shipment was not picked up until December 3, was rescheduled for delivery on
December 7, and was actually delivered on December 12.  Mr. Friedman testifies that SEAC's
driver was unable to make the rescheduled delivery on December 7 and that, instead of placing
the shipment in a public warehouse as SEAC wanted to do, CDS arranged to transfer the
shipment from SEAC's vehicle to a truck operated by C.D.S. Lines, Inc. (C.D.S.), a CDS
affiliate.  C.D.S. held the shipment until it was delivered on December 12.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Attached to Mr. Friedman's statement as Exhibit C is a copy of an invoice dated
December 16, 1993, issued by SEAC to CDS assessing CDS a flat rate of $2,000 for the subject
shipment.  Mr. Friedman states that CDS deducted $466.50 for expenses incurred by C.D.S. for
driver layover, and for transfer of shipment expenses, and that CDS then remitted the balance of
$1,533.50 to SEAC.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>	

<p>	Also attached to Mr. Friedman's statement are copies of correspondence sent to CDS by
Mr. Danny C. Homan, SEAC's operations manager, contesting CDS's action in deducting
$466.50 from the originally invoiced freight charge for the shipment (Exhibit G).  Mr. Homan
warned Mr. Friedman that the "failure to pay in full within 30 days voids all contract rates and
subjects all shipments to our tariff rate provisions."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	SEAC's reply includes a statement by Mr. Homan claiming that SEAC provided CDS
common carrier service in transporting the Hasbro shipment.  Mr. Homan contends that each
shipment arranged for by CDS and transported by SEAC was individually negotiated and was
subject to rates in SEAC's range tariff,<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> ICC TRME 101, a tariff that allowed SEAC to negotiate 
flat rates on a shipment by shipment basis.  Mr. Homan further maintains that the agreed-to flat
rate was to be applied so long as full payment for the invoice was made within the credit period
prescribed in SEAC's Rules Tariff ICC SECJ 101.  He asserts that SEAC did not enter into a
contract for a series of shipments, dedicate equipment for CDS's or Hasbro's exclusive use, or
provide specialized service.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Mr. Homan contends that the bill of lading issued for the subject shipment incorporates
SEAC's tariffs and classifications by reference.  He asserts that SEAC wanted to unload the
shipment when it arrived in Indianapolis, but the consignee, Target, denied access to its facility. 
Mr. Homan states that SEAC's tariffs provide for assessment of detention charges when power
units and trailers are detained at arrival because the consignee is unable or unwilling to unload. 
He further states that when CDS advised his office on December 9 that it wanted to reconsign the
shipment, he instructed the driver not to release the load until Hasbro or CDS signed the bill of
lading, assuring that the freight charges would be paid.  Mr. Homan claims that because Hasbro
and CDS failed to pay the charges in full, SEAC was permitted to assess the common carrier
tariff charges as incorporated in its bill of lading, including trailer detention and attorneys' fees.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In rebuttal, Mr. Friedman states that CDS and SEAC did not intend that the flat rate
would apply only if the invoice was paid within the credit period authorized by SEAC's rules
tariff.  According to Mr. Friedman, when CDS contacted SEAC about the shipment, the parties
did not discuss any tariff rates or prescribed payment period to protect the negotiated rate.  Mr.
Friedman asserts that the shipment was tendered to SEAC to be transported under that carrier's
contract carrier authority and that SEAC did not indicate otherwise.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	CDS disputes SEAC's contention that the flat rate was negotiated under its range tariff
ICC TRME 101.  According to CDS, Items 45 and 50 of the range tariff indicate that the tariff
applies only to an "excess capacity program."  CDS asserts that the subject shipment did not
move pursuant to that program.  CDS further alleges that the range tariff requires that the bills of
lading contain specific reference to the common carrier tariff item on which the agreed-to rate, in
cents per mile, is based.  CDS notes that none of the shipping documents on this record (those
relating to prior shipments handled by SEAC and the subject Hasbro shipment) comply with the
tariff's rate reference requirement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Even though the Termination Act eliminated the distinction between common and
contract carriers, new section 13710(b) gives the Board jurisdiction to resolve disputes as to
whether transportation performed by an authorized carrier prior to January 1, 1996, was provided
in its common carrier or contract carrier capacity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) had recognized two types of for-hire motor carriers: 
common carriers and contract carriers.  Common carriers offered for-hire transportation to the
general shipping public.  49 U.S.C. 10102(14).  <u>See</u> <u>Regular Common Carrier Conf. v. United
States</u>, 803 F.2d 1186, 1187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  To guard against carrier discrimination among
shippers, the ICA required that a common carrier file public tariffs and charge only those rates
contained in the filed tariffs.  49 U.S.C. 10761, 10762.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  A common carrier's filed rate was the
legal rate and the only rate that the carrier was permitted to charge (and that a shipper was
obligated to pay) for the carriage, unless that rate was set aside by the ICC as unreasonable or
otherwise unlawful.  <u>Maislin Indus. v. Primary Steel</u>, 497 U.S. 116, 127 (1990).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Contract carriers, on the other hand, provided transportation services for shippers under
continuing agreements by:  (1) assigning vehicles for a continuing period of time for the
exclusive use of such shippers, or (2) providing transportation services designed to meet the
distinct needs of the shippers.  49 U.S.C. 10102(16),<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> <u>See</u> <u>Aero Mayflower Transit v. ICC</u>, 711
F.2d 224, 226-27 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  The rates of contract carriers, unlike those of common
carriers before TIRRA, were set and maintained privately.  They could be lower (or higher) than
a carrier's common carrier rates, and they were exempted from the filed rate doctrine.  49 U.S.C.
10761(b), 10762(f).  <u>See</u> <u>Exemption of Motor Contract Carriers from Tariff Filing Requirements</u>,
133 M.C.C. 150 (1983), <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom</u>. <u>Central &amp; S. Motor Freight Tariff Ass'n. v. United
States</u>, 757 F.2d 301 (D.C. Cir.), <u>cert</u>. <u>denied</u>, 474 U.S. 1019 (1985).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In resolving disputes concerning whether particular services were common or contract
carriage, the ICC has held that the type of commitment between the parties may determine the
type of carriage provided.  <u>ZoneSkip, Inc. v. UPS, Inc. and  UPS of America, Inc.</u>, 8 I.C.C.2d
645, 653-55 (1992) (<u>ZoneSkip</u>), <u>pet</u>. <u>for</u> <u>review</u> <u>denied</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom</u>., <u>ZoneSkip, Inc. v. United States</u>,
998 F.2d 1007 (3d Cir. 1993) (Table).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	To determine whether the Hasbro shipment moved in contract carriage, we must
consider:  (1) whether SEAC held appropriate contract carrier authority to provide the service;
(2) whether SEAC and CDS, acting on Hasbro's behalf, had an agreement for transportation to be
provided as contract carriage, and the shipment moved under that agreement; and (3) whether the
transportation was consistent with the statutory definition of contract carriage, i.e., (a) the
shipment moved under a continuing agreement, or (b) the transportation service provided was
designed to meet a distinct need of the shipper.  <u>Freightliner Corp. &amp; Mercedes-Benz Truck
Co.,--Rates</u>, 9 I.C.C.2d at 1031, 1040 (1993). <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom</u>., <u>In re Transcon Lines</u>, 89 F.3d 559
(9th Cir. 1996) (<u>Transcon</u>).  In making such a determination, the ICC examined the totality of the

<p>	A.  <u>Contract Carrier Authority</u>.  SEAC holds appropriate contract carrier authority to
provide the service.  When the shipment took place, SEAC had authority from the ICC to
transport shipments for CDS, as well as all other commercial shippers or receivers of general
commodities under Docket No. MC-191696, which was issued October 26, 1990.  This point is
not in issue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	B.  <u>Contract Carriage Agreement</u>.  The Hasbro shipment moved under the equipment
contract.  The terms of the contract clearly showed that the shipment was tendered to SEAC as a
contract carrier.  The contract is signed by SEAC's driver indicating that SEAC accepted the
terms in the equipment contract.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In addition, Mr. Friedman testifies that CDS and SEAC intended for the Hasbro shipment
to be transported under SEAC's contract carrier permit.  Correspondence from Mr. Homan, as
well as his testimony, confirm that SEAC intended to move the Hasbro shipment under its
contract carrier authority and agreed to accept the negotiated flat rate for its transportation
service.  The correspondence further indicates that only after CDS refused to pay the agreed-to
flat rate under the contract did SEAC attempt to recharacterize the transportation service as
common carriage and seek to collect freight charges under its common carrier tariffs.  There is
nothing on the record to confirm SEAC's contention that its range tariff (or any other published
rate) was intended to be applied to the Hasbro shipment at the time it was transported.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

determined to be the basis of contract carriage.  <u>RPL Associates, Inc.--Petition for Declaratory

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	C.  <u>Statutory definition</u>.  Here, considering the totality of the circumstances, it is clear 
that the Hasbro shipment moved under a continuing agreement between CDS and SEAC and that 
SEAC tailored its service to meet the needs of CDS and its clients.  Testimony from Mr.
Friedman shows that CDS and SEAC had a continuing contract carrier relationship since 1987. 
Between April 1992 and October 1993, CDS arranged for SEAC to transport 20 other shipments
pursuant to its contract carrier authority.  Copies of the equipment contracts for these shipments
submitted in this proceeding clearly evidence an intent by the parties to provide and receive
contract carrier service on a continuing basis.  The Hasbro shipment was part of a pattern
established by CDS and SEAC for contract carrier service.  Each of the shipments referred to on
the record was moved pursuant to an equipment contract that specified that "Each shipment
tendered . . . on and after the date of this Confirmation shall be a tender to Carrier as a Motor
Contract Carrier and shall be subject only to the terms of each Confirmation and the provisions
of law applicable to Motor Contract Carriage."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Likewise, SEAC's service was tailored to meet the needs of CDS and its clients.  The
transportation service was provided under terms set by the equipment contracts.  The rate for the
shipment was negotiated on an individual basis by the parties.  During the negotiations to
establish the contract carrier relationship, CDS made it clear that it desired price flexibility. 
These factors indicate that the subject transportation service was designed to meet the specific
needs of CDS and its clients.  <u>See</u> <u>Ford</u>, 9 I.C.C.2d at 911-12 (" `distinct needs' test could be met
by price considerations.").  SEAC failed to submit any evidence to rebut this evidence.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Moreover, SEAC has not claimed that it provided common carrier service, or sought to
collect undercharges from CDS for any of the other shipments.  The dispute here arose because
CDS sought to offset its claimed costs for the delayed delivery against the negotiated contract
rate.  The parties' ensuing collection dispute does not change the underlying nature of the
transportation service provided in this case.  At the time this shipment moved, the parties had
made a commitment to contract carriage and had performed as if bound by the agreement.  <u>See</u>
<u>ZoneSkip</u>; <u>Transcon</u>.

<p> 

<p>	From the evidence on record, we find that the CDS and SEAC had established a contract
carrier relationship and that the service provided by SEAC in transporting the Hasbro shipment
was based on this relationship.  We further find that the Hasbro shipment moved in contract
carriage and did not move under SEAC's filed common carrier rates.  As a result, CDS is not
obligated for undercharges, detention charges, and attorneys' fees based on SEAC's filed
common carrier rates.

conservation of energy resources.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>  The ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (Termination Act
or the Act), which took effect on January 1, 1996, abolished the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) and transferred certain functions and proceedings to the Surface
Transportation Board (Board).  Section 204(b)(1) of the Act provides, in general, that
proceedings pending before the ICC on the effective date of that legislation shall be decided
under the law in effect prior to January 1, 1996, insofar as they involve functions retained by the
Act.  This decision relates to a proceeding that was pending with the ICC prior to January 1,
1996, and to functions that are subject to Board jurisdiction pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13710(b). 
Therefore, this decision applies the law in effect prior to the Act, and citations are to the former
sections of the statute, unless otherwise indicated.
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>  SEAC is not bankrupt and is currently operating.  It holds common and contract carrier
operating authority under No. MC-191696 and MC-191696 (Sub-No. 5).  As a result, section
2(e) of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-180 (NRA) (now codified at 49 U.S.C.
13711) does not apply to this proceeding.
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>  Delivery was originally scheduled for December 6, 1993.  Because of a delay in the
pickup of the shipment , the delivery date was rescheduled for December 7, 1993.  The shipment
was ultimately delivered to the consignee on December 12, 1993.
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>  Items 10 and 200 of ICC SECJ 400.
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>  Item 80 of ICC SECJ 400 provides for detention charges of $50 per hour after 120
minutes of free time.  SEAC claims that its vehicle was detained for 26 hours on December 8 and
9, 1993.
<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>  SEAC claimed attorneys' fees under Item 100 of its Rules Tariff ICC SECJ 101.  Under
this provision, SEAC can charge interest and attorneys' fees to collect past due accounts.
<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>  "O.S.&amp;D." is an abbreviation for Over short and damage.
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>  SEAC filed a motion to strike the verified statements of Mr. Friedman and Mr.
Samardak, claiming that they falsely state that CDS operated as a freight forwarder.  We deny the
motion. Though the facts on record here indicate that CDS functioned here as a broker in
arranging for SEAC to provide transportation service on behalf of Hasbro, CDS's operating
status is not vital to the resolution of the merits of this case.

<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>  The Exhibit C invoice bears a stamped "Paid January 11, 1994" marking.
<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>  A range tariff of the type applicable when this shipment moved did not establish a
specific rate for a given movement, but, rather, provided that the carrier negotiates rates with a

103-311, 108 Stat. 1673, enacted on August 26, 1994 (TIRRA), most motor common carriers of
property (excluding household goods) were freed from the requirement that they file and charge
individually determined tariff rates.  This prospective change does not affect our analysis of this
case. 
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>  This definition incorporates amendments made in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, Pub.
L. No. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793, but in substance remains the definition enacted in 1957.  (A
recodification of the statute in 1978 changed the wording but did not change the law.)  <u>See</u> <u>Ford
Motor Co. v. Security Services f/k/a Riss Intl.</u>, 9 I.C.C.2d 892, 910 (1993) (<u>Ford</u>), for a
