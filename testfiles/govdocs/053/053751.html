<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  (a) Brokers carry on their business operations in several different ways and are generally classified by their method of operation. The following are some of the broad groupings by method of operation. The usual operation of brokers consists of the negotiation of the purchase and sale of produce either of one commodity or of several commodities. A broker is usually engaged by only one of the parties, but in negotiating a contract the broker acts as a special agent of first one and then the other party in conveying offers, counter offers, and acceptances between the parties. Once the contract is formed, and the confirmation issued, the broker's duties are usually ended, and the broker is not the proper party to whom notice of breach or of rejection should be directed. However, a broker receiving notice has a duty to promptly convey the notice to the proper party. Frequently, brokers never see the produce they are quoting for sale or negotiating for purchase by the buyer, and they carry out their duties by conveying information received from the parties between the buyer and seller until a contract is effected. Generally, the seller of the produce invoices the buyer, however, when there is a specific agreement between the broker and its principal, the seller invoices the broker who, in turn, invoices the buyer, collects, and remits to the seller. Under other types of agreements, the seller ships the produce to pool buyers, and the broker as an accommodation to the seller invoices the buyers, collects, and remits to the seller. Also, there are times when the broker is authorized by the seller to act much like a commission merchant, being given blanket authority to dispose of the produce for the seller's account either by negotiation of sales to buyers not known to the seller or by placing the produce for sale on consignment with receivers in the terminal markets.</p>  <p>  (b) There is a second general grouping of brokers which are commonly referred to as buying brokers. Their operations are typified by the fact that they act as the buyer's representative in negotiating purchases at shipping points, terminal markets, or intermediate points. Their typical type of operation is to negotiate a purchase on the buyer's instructions and authorization. Sometimes the broker negotiates the purchase without seeing the produce. In other instances he may select the merchandise after forming an appraisal of the quality of the produce being offered for sale on the market. Generally, a purchase is made in the buyer's name and the seller invoices the buyer direct. On the other hand, acting on authority given him by the buyer, the broker may negotiate purchases in his own name, pay the seller for the produce, make arrangements for its loading and shipment, and bill the buyer direct for the cost price plus the brokerage fee and the cost of any agreed upon accessorial service charges such as ice, loading, etc.</p>  <p>[28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]</p><a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.244.28"><h5>&#167;&nbsp;46.28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties of brokers.</h5></a>
<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  (a) <I>General. </I>The function of a broker is to facilitate good faith negotiations between parties which lead to valid and binding contracts. A broker who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, in connection with any transaction is in violation of the Act, is subject to the penalties specified in the Act, and may be held liable for damages which accrue as a result of the violation. It shall be the duty of the broker to fully inform the parties concerning all proposed terms and conditions of the proposed contract. After all parties agree on the terms and the contract is effected, the broker shall prepare in writing and deliver promptly to all parties a properly executed confirmation or memorandum of sale setting forth truly and correctly all of the essential details of the agreement between the parties, including any express agreement as to the time when payment is due. The confirmation or memorandum of sale shall also identify the party who engaged the broker to act in the negotiations. If the confirmation or memorandum of sale does not contain such information, the broker shall be presumed to have been engaged by the buyer. Brokers do not normally act as general agents of either party, and will not be presumed to have so acted. Unless otherwise agreed and confirmed, the broker will be entitled to payment of brokerage fees from the party by whom it was engaged to act as broker. The broker shall retain a copy of such confirmations or memoranda as part of its accounts and records. The broker who does not prepare these documents and retain copies in its files is failing to prepare and maintain complete and correct records as required by the Act. The broker who does not deliver copies of these documents to all parties involved in the transaction is failing to perform its duties as a broker. A broker who issues a confirmation or memorandum of sale containing false or misleading statements shall be deemed to have committed a violation of section 2 of the Act. If the broker's records do not support its contentions that a binding contract was made with proper notice to the parties, the broker may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from such negligence, or for other penalties provided by the Act for failing to perform its express or implied duties. The broker shall take into consideration the time of delivery of the shipment involved in the contract, and all other circumstances of the transaction, in selecting the proper method for transmitting the written confirmation or memorandum of sale to the parties. A buying broker is required to truly and correctly account to its principal in accordance with &sect;46.2(y)(3). The broker should advise the appropriate party promptly when any notice of rejection or breach is received, or of any other unforeseen development of which it is informed.</p>  <p>  (b) <I>Brokerage fees. </I>A broker is not considered to be entitled to a brokerage fee unless he effects a sale or makes a valid and binding contract, fully performing his duties as a broker. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, the broker does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and is entitled to receive prompt payment of the brokerage fee whenever a valid and binding contract is negotiated. Brokerage fees may be charged to only one of the parties to the contract unless by prior agreement the parties agree to split the brokerage fee. If the brokerage fee is charged to both parties without a specific prior agreement, such action by the broker is a violation of the Act. A broker employed to negotiate the sale of produce may not employ another broker or selling agent, including auction companies, without the specific prior approval of his principal. When the broker is authorized to sell, invoice the buyer, collect and remit to his principal, he shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment, showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted, any auction charges and any other expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act.</p>  <p>  (c) <I>Broker's responsibility for payment. </I>In the absence of a specific agreement, a broker is not responsible for payment to the seller by the buyer. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to the seller is not a guarantee by the broker that the buyer will pay for the produce purchased, unless there is a specific agreement by the broker that he will pay if the buyer does not pay. A broker who agrees to collect funds from the buyer for his principal shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted and all expenses including auction charges, incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act. While the broker is not obliged to furnish his principal information regarding the financial condition of the buyer, if the broker furnishes such information, he must truthfully report the information available to him, and any false or misleading statements for a fraudulent purpose to the principal to encourage the sale will be a violation of the Act. A buying broker who negotiates a purchase in his own name under an agreement with his principal, is responsible for payment of the purchase price to the seller. A broker has no authority to grant allowances or adjust the seller's invoice price to the buyer without the specific prior approval of his principal.</p>  <p>  (d) <I>Purchases and sales by brokers. </I>A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a broker and a dealer, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as a broker to the buyer or the seller when he is acting as a dealer purchasing produce or selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. When a person purchases or sells produce as a dealer, he shall not request or receive a brokerage fee from the buyer or the seller. A broker shall not negotiate a transaction where the broker is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the direct or indirect control of the broker without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.</p>  <p>  (e) <I>Filing carrier claims by brokers. </I>Without prior consent of the owner, a broker has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name. A broker has no obligation to file carrier claims for the owners of the shipments. However, when a broker in a transaction receives information valuable to the owner in connection with carrier claim rights, the broker should promptly advise the owner. A broker who agrees to protect the carrier claims of owners shall at all times exercise reasonable care to fulfill such obligation. If a broker makes an agreement with a seller or a buyer to file and handle such a claim for the benefit of the owner of the produce, the claim shall be filed promptly with the carrier, supported by adequate evidence, and he shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. A copy of the claim shall be forwarded to the owner of the shipment when the claim is filed. When settlement of the claim is effected, the broker shall promptly remit the net amount due the owner, after deducting the agreed or customary charges for handling the claim. Adequate information shall be furnished the owner regarding the claim while the matter is being handled with the carrier. If the owner files the claim, the broker shall promptly furnish any necessary information available in his records which is requested by the owner.</p>  <p>[28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 37 FR 14561, July 21, 1972; 62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]</p><a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.245"><h5>Receiving Market Commission Merchants and Joint Account Partners</h5></a>

Complete and detailed records shall be prepared and maintained by all commission merchants and joint account partners covering produce received, sales, quantities lost, dates and cost of repacking or reconditioning, unloading, handling, freight, demurrage or auction charges, and any other expenses which are deducted on the accounting, in accordance with the provisions of &sect;46.18 through &sect;46.23. When rendering account sales for produce handled for or on behalf of another, an accurate and itemized report of sales and expenses charged against the shipment shall be made. It is a violation of section 2 of the Act to fail to render true and correct accountings in connection with consignments or produce handled on joint account. Charges which cannot be supported by proper evidence in the records of the commission merchant or joint account partner shall not be deducted. The commission merchant or joint account partner may be held liable for any financial loss and for other penalties provided by the Act, due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any transaction subject to the Act.</p>  <p>  (b) <I>Commission charges. </I>Before accepting produce on consignment, the parties should reach a definite agreement on the amount of the commission and other charges which will be assessed by the commission merchant. In the absence of such an agreement, only the usual and customary commission and other charges shall be permitted. The receiver may not reconsign produce to another person or firm, including auction companies, and incur additional commissions, charges or expenses without the specific prior authority of the consignor. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, joint account partners shall not charge a commission fee or other selling charges against the joint account for disposing of the produce. When a portion of a consigned shipment is purchased by the commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.</p>  <p>  (c) <I>Purchasing consigned produce. </I>A commission merchant or joint account partner may not purchase produce received on consignment or joint account or sell such produce to any person or firm over whose business he has direct or indirect control, or to any person or firm having direct or indirect control over his business, without specific prior authority of the consignor or the joint account partner. However, produce may be purchased by the commission merchant or joint account partner at reasonable market value to clean up remnants of shipments so accountings will not be unduly delayed, provided the accounting shows the quantity and price of the goods bought by the commission merchant or joint account partner. &ldquo;Remnants,&rdquo; as used here, mean small quantities remaining after the bulk of the shipment has been sold but shall not exceed 5 percent of the shipment. When consigned produce is purchased by a commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.</p>  <p>  (d) <I>Filing carrier claims. </I>Without the prior consent of the owner of the produce, a commission merchant has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name: <I>Provided, </I>That the commission merchant may file a claim for breakage where the owner has been paid for the full value of the produce without any deduction for damage. Commission merchants have no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for the owners. However, when a commission merchant in a transaction receives information valuable to the consignor in connection with carrier claim rights, the commission merchant should promptly advise the consignor. Before a commission merchant files a carrier claim on a consigned shipment, a specific agreement shall be reached with the consignor. If a commission merchant is authorized and agrees to file the claim, he shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to the consignor and shall exercise reasonable care to protect the interests of the consignor by filing the claim promptly and in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. When settlement of the claim is effected, he shall promptly remit the net amount due the consignor, after deducting the agreed handling charges. Full and complete information shall be furnished the consignor while the claim is being handled. If the consignor is to file the claim, the commission merchant shall exercise reasonable care to protect the claim rights of the consignor and shall promptly furnish all necessary information and evidence from his records to enable the consignor to file a proper claim. A joint account partner who files a carrier claim on behalf of the partnership shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to his partner, keep him advised of its status, and remit promptly his share of the net proceeds realized from such claim.</p>  <a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.246"><h5>Growers' Agents and Shippers</h5></a>
<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.246.30"><h5>&#167;&nbsp;46.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of operations by growers' agents and shippers.</h5></a>
<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  (a) The usual operations of shippers consist of purchasing produce from growers in their own names. They distribute the produce in commerce by selling, consigning, or jointing the shipments, assuming any loss or profits that result from these operations. In addition, shippers may handle produce on joint account with growers or others.</p>  <p>  (b) Growers' agents sell and distribute produce for or on behalf of growers and others and, in addition, may perform a wide variety of services, such as financing, planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing labor, seed, containers, and other supplies or services. They usually distribute the produce in their own names and collect payment direct from the consignees. They render accountings to their principals, paying the net proceeds after deducting their expenses and fees. Some agents are limited by contract to making only sales and cannot joint or consign produce without obtaining the prior consent of the growers. Other agents are granted blanket authority by the growers to market and distribute the produce, using their discretion as to the best methods, depending on market conditions and the quality of the produce available. They can sell, consign or ship on joint account, use the services of brokers or sell through terminal market auctions. They are authorized to grant credits, make adjustments in the invoice price, handle claims with the carriers, or even abandon shipments, when circumstances justify such action, without consulting the growers. Some agents have an agreement with the growers to pool the produce and render accountings on the basis of the average or prorated selling prices after deducting the prorated expenses incurred for the various operations performed and the agents' selling fees. Some agents's contracts require an accounting on the basis of actual selling prices after deducting the actual expenses incurred for services performed and the selling fees. Some agents' contracts specify a fixed charge for harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing the container or other services, plus a selling fee, and thereby substantially reduce the record requirements necessary to prove the cost of the various operations.</p>  <a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.246.31"><h5>&#167;&nbsp;46.31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties of shippers.</h5></a>
<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  (a) <I>General. </I>The responsibilities of shippers vary with their contracts with growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint account. Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend upon their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They shall fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint account transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or implied duty is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of his transactions.</p>  <p>  (b) <I>Receiving records. </I>Each shipper shall prepare and maintain a record of all produce handled including his own production. This record shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book), with numbered pages or comparable business records. This receiving record shall show for each lot the date received, whether purchased or received on joint account, the quantity, quality, and kind of produce, the purchase price or joint account cost, and the name and address of the supplier. Shippers shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received.</p>  <p>  (c) <I>Disposition records. </I>When a shipper purchases produce from growers or others, his records shall also show the disposition of the produce, whether sold or consigned, date of shipment, car number, or if shipped by truck, the license number, name and address of the carrier, name and address of the buyer, commission merchant or auction, and other pertinent details of the transaction, such as the terms of sale, selling price, and date of payment.</p>  <p>  (d) <I>Joint accounts with growers. </I>When a shipper enters into a joint account transaction with growers or others, the agreement between the parties should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the shipper's authority in distributing the produce. The shipper shall prepare and maintain records to show in detail the actual expenses incurred for the services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading, packing and selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by the parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is at the same time handling similar produce not involved in the joint account transaction, a lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in order to segregate and identify the various lots of produce. If a shipper consigns all or part of the produce or employs the services of brokers or terminal market auctions, his records shall show the results of these transactions, including the expenses involved and the names and addresses of the commission merchants, brokers, and the auctions. The shipper shall render a detailed and accurate accounting and pay promptly the net proceeds due the joint partner, in accordance with &sect;46.2(y), (z), and (aa). The accounting shall disclose the status of all claims collected or filed with the carriers.</p>  <p>  (e) <I>Joint accounts with receivers. </I>When a shipper enters into a joint account agreement with a terminal market dealer, the agreement should be reduced to writing clearly defining the terms of the agreement. The shipper's records shall show the expenses which may be properly charged in accordance with the joint agreement, purchase price or joint account cost of the produce, and cost of harvesting, packing, grading, or other expenses. His records shall show the quantity and quality of the produce packed and shipped, the dates and methods of shipment, and all other pertinent details of his operation. At the conclusion of the transaction, a detailed and accurate accounting shall be furnished promptly to the joint partner, in accordance with &sect;46.2(z). If a deficit results, the shipper shall pay promptly his share of the deficit.</p>  <a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.246.32"><h5>&#167;&nbsp;46.32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties of growers' agents.</h5></a>
<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  (a) <I>General. </I>The duties, responsibilities, and extent of the authority of a growers' agent depend on the type of contract made with the growers. Agreements between growers and agents should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the agent's authority in distributing the produce. When such agreements between the parties are not reduced to written contracts, the agent shall have available a written statement describing the terms and conditions under which he will handle the produce of the grower during the current season and shall mail or deliver this statement to the grower on or before receipt of the first lot. A grower will be considered to have agreed to these terms if, after receiving such statement, he delivers his produce to the agent for handling in the usual manner. In the event an unsolicited lot of produce is accepted by an agent for handling in his usual manner, he shall promptly deliver or mail a copy of such statement to the grower. A copy of this statement, showing the name of the grower and the date the statement was delivered to the grower, shall be retained in the agent's files. An agent who does not have in his files either written contracts or a written statement as required herein is failing to prepare and maintain full and complete records as required by the Act. <I>Provided, </I>That regulations or bylaws of cooperative marketing associations may be used in lieu of individual agreements or contracts to determine the methods of accounting and settlement with their grower members. An agent who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom and for other penalties provided under the Act for such failure.</p>  <p>  (b) <I>Accounting for charges. </I>A growers' agent whose operations include such services as the planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing of containers or other supplies, storing, selling or distributing produce for or on behalf of growers shall prepare and maintain complete records on all transactions in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. Agents must be in a position to render to the growers accurate and detailed accountings covering all aspects of their handling of the produce. Agents shall maintain a record of all produce received in the form of a book (preferably a bound book) with numbered pages or comparable business records, showing for each lot the date received, quantity, the kind of produce and the name and address of the grower. Agents shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received. A lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot in order to segregate the various lots of produce received from different growers from similar produce being handled at the same time. Each lot shall be so identified and segregated throughout all operations conducted by the agent, including the sale or other disposition of the produce. The records shall show the result of all packing and grading operations, including the quantity lost through packing and grading and the quantity and quality packed out. If the culls are sold, they shall be included in the accounting. Unless there is a specific agreement with the growers to pool all various growers' produce, the accounting to each of the growers shall itemize the actual expenses incurred for the various operations conducted by the agent and all the details of the disposition of the produce received from each grower including all sales, adjustments, rejections, details of consigned or jointed shipments and sales through brokers, auctions, and status of all claims filed with or collected from the carriers. The agent shall prepare and maintain full and complete records on all details of such distribution to provide supporting evidence for the accounting. If an agent is working under a pool agreement with growers, the accounting shall show how the pool cost and pool sales prices are computed. If the agent and the growers have agreed on a fixed charge to cover the various operations conducted by the agent, actual expenses incurred for these services covered by the agreement are not required to be shown in the accounting. The failure of the agent to render prompt, accurate and detailed accountings in accordance with &sect;46.2 (z) and (aa), is a violation of the Act.</p>  <p>  (c) <I>Sales through brokers or auctions. </I>Unless a growers' agent is specifically authorized in his contract with the growers to use the services of brokers, commission merchants, joint partners, or auctions, he is not entitled to use these methods of marketing the growers' produce. Any expense incurred for such services, without the growers' permission, cannot be charged to the growers.</p>  <p>  (d) <I>Filing of carrier claims. </I>Without the prior consent of the growers, an agent has no authority to file claims with the carriers in his own name or any other name. An agent has no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for growers in the absence of a specific agreement to perform these duties. All information which an agent has received in handling the shipment which is essential for the growers to file such claims shall be made available to the growers. If an agent has an agreement with the growers to file and handle carrier claims, he shall exercise reasonable care in handling the claims with the carriers by filing the claim promptly in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and take any necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion.</p>  <p>  (e) <I>Purchases and sales by growers' agents. </I>A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a growers' agent and as a shipper, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as an agent, when he is acting as a shipper selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. A growers' agent shall not charge or receive a fee from the seller or the buyer when he purchases or sells produce as a shipper. A growers' agent shall not negotiate a transaction where he is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to such transactions, other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the agent's direct or indirect control, without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.</p>  <p>  (f) <I>Negligence of agent. </I>A growers' agent may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting to the growers due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any undertaking in connection with transactions subject to the Act.</p>  <p>  (g) <I>Responsibility for payment. </I>An agent is not responsible for the payment by the buyer who has purchased the growers' produce on credit, unless he guarantees payment or is negligent in extending credit. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to his principal is not a guarantee by the agent that the agent will pay if the buyer does not pay.</p>  <p>  (h) <I>Responsibility for payment of selling fees and expenses to the growers' agent. </I>In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, the agent does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and he is entitled to the payment of his selling fees and expenses incurred in handling the produce of growers or others, providing he fully performs his duties as agent.</p>  <p>  (i) <I>Agent's financial responsibility to buyers for failure to comply with contracts. </I>If a growers' agent contracts in his own name to deliver produce to a buyer and subsequently cannot deliver produce complying with the contract because the growers cannot or will not deliver such produce to him, he may be liable to the buyer for damages resulting from the breach of the contract.</p>  <a name="7:2.1.1.2.16.0.247"><h5>Conversion of Funds</h5></a>

If a good delivery standard for a commodity is set forth in &sect;46.44, and that commodity at the contract destination contains deterioration in excess of any tolerance provided therein, it will be considered abnormally deteriorated. The seller has no responsibility for any deterioration in transit if there is no contract destination agreed upon between the parties.</p>  <p>  (k) <I>Suitable shipping condition, </I>in connection with reconsigned rolling or tramp cars, means that the commodity, at time of sale, meets the requirements of this phrase as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, relating to direct shipments.</p>  <p>  (l) <I>F.o.b. acceptance </I>or <I>Shipping point acceptance </I>means that the buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has no right of rejection.

Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a roller, rolling car, or a car in transit is sold f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to have assumed only the lowest all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination: <I>Provided, </I>That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.</p>  <p>  (r) <I>Tramp car </I>or <I>tramp car sale </I>means that the produce has left the shipping point under a bill of lading issued prior to the day on which the quotation is made and has moved or is moving over a route out of line of haul with the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, or has been moving over a route in line of haul between the point of origin and the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, but has been delayed in transit by the seller, or has been held by the transportation company at diversion or other points en route awaiting instructions from the shipper and by such holding or delay has missed scheduled movement between points of shipment and the market in which it is to be delivered as the result of the transaction in question. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a &ldquo;tramp car&rdquo; is sold f.o.b. shipping point or a &ldquo;tramp car sale&rdquo; is made f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to assume only the lowest authorized all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties, together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination: <I>Provided, </I>That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.</p>  <p>  (s) <I>Rolling acceptance </I>means that the buyer accepts at time of purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of acceptance of the commodity.</p>  <p>  (t) <I>Rolling acceptance final </I>means the same as <I>Rolling acceptance </I>except that the buyer has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition of the produce in transit.

(For example, the U.S. No. 1 grade provides a 12 percent tolerance for damage at destination. If a lot contains 5 percent damage by permanent grade factors, 7 percent of the tolerance can be applied to damage by condition factors. The additional 3 percent Good Delivery tolerance would then allow a total of 10 percent damage by condition factors in this shipment at destination.)</p>  <p>  (2) If the contract does not specify a U.S. grade or percentage of condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain a maximum of 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. Sales made on a percentage of a U.S. grade, without specifying the percentage of condition defects separately from the permanent defects, fall under this provision, and the lettuce may not contain more than a total of 15 percent condition defects at destination. However, if the condition defects are specified, provision No. 3 will apply.</p>  <p>  (3) If the contract specifies a percentage of individual or combined condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain either of the following, whichever is greater:</p>  <p>  (i) One and one-half times the specified percentage of damage or serious damage by condition defects: <I>Provided, </I>That, if serious damage is not specified, one-half of the allowance at destination may be serious damage, including therein not more than one-quarter of the total allowance may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. (For example, a lot sold as &ldquo;16 percent tipburn&rdquo; could have a total of 24 percent damage by tipburn at destination, including not more than 12 percent serious damage of which not more than 6 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.) or</p>  <p>  (ii) Up to 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.</p>  <p>Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, condition defects will be considered to be damage as defined in the U.S. Standards for Lettuce.</p><p>  (4) If the contract clearly indicates by descriptive terms that the lettuce is of inferior quality, larger allowances for damage by condition defects than those specified above will be applied.</p>  <p>  (5) If the buyer and the seller agree to percentages for defects at destination, higher or lower than those specified above, such percentages will determine whether good delivery is made.</p>  <p>[26 FR 12209, Dec. 21, 1961.

<a href="#PartTop"><img src="/e/ecfr/graphics/ret-arrow-generic-grey.gif" alt="" > top</a><p>  It is a violation of section 2(5) for a commission merchant, dealer, or broker to misrepresent by word, act, mark, stencil, label, statement, or deed, the character, kind, grade, quality, quantity, size, pack, weight, condition, degree, or maturity, or State, country, region of origin of any perishable agricultural commodity received, shipped, sold, or offered to be sold in interstate or foreign commerce. However, a person other than the first licensee handling misbranded perishable agricultural commodities shall not be held liable for a violation of section 2(5) of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the person did not have knowledge of the violation or lacked the ability to correct the violation.</p>  <p>  (a) <I>Violations. </I>Violations are considered to be serious, very serious, or repeated and/or flagrant, depending upon the circumstances of the misrepresentation.</p>  <p>  (1) <I>Serious violations. </I>Include the following:</p>  <p>  (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, exceeding the tolerance(s) in an amount up to and including double the tolerance provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;</p>  <p>  (ii) Any lot of perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as failing to meet the declared weight;</p>  <p>  (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity in which the State, country, or region of origin of the produce is misrepresentated because the lot is made up of containers with various labels or markings that reflect more than one incorrect State, country or region of origin. Example: A lot with containers individually marked to show the origin as Idaho or Maine or Colorado when the produce was grown in Wisconsin; or</p>  <p>  (iv) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.</p>  <p>  (2) <I>Very serious violations. </I>Include the following:</p>  <p>  (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, in excess of double the tolerance(s) provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;</p>  <p>  (ii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity packed in containers showing a single point of origin, which is other than that in which the produce was grown, such as containers marked &ldquo;California&rdquo; when the produce was grown in Arizona;</p>  <p>  (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as having an average net weight more than four percent below the declared weight;</p>  <p>  (iv) Multiple sales or shipments of a misrepresented perishable agricultural commodity within a seven day period that can be attributed to one cause; or</p>  <p>  (v) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.</p>  <p>  (3) <I>Flagrant violations. </I>Include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following examples:</p>  <p>  (i) Shipment or sale of a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity from shipping point after notification by official inspection that the inspected commodity fails to comply with any marking on the container without first correcting the misbranding;</p>  <p>  (ii) To offer for resale or consignment, a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity that has been officially inspected at destination and found to be misbranded without advising a prospective receiver that the lot is misbranded and that the misbranding must be corrected before resale. When a resale or consignment is finalized, <I>written </I>notice must be given that the lot is misbranded and must be corrected before resale; or</p>  <p>  (iii) To withhold or fail to disclose known material facts with respect to a misrepresentation or misbranding.</p>  <p>  (b) <I>Evidence. </I>(1) Evidence concerning a misrepresentation or misbranding includes official certificates of an inspection made by any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables or other public certifiers, and includes investigations and audit findings and any business records, testimony or other evidence bearing on the subject.</p>  <p>  (2) When a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity has been officially inspected, and certification is made that the descriptive container markings are correct, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original findings, both inspection certificates will be accepted as evidence to show that the shipper/seller has <I>not </I>misrepresented the lot.

However, it may be cited as a part of the pattern of violations if formal proceedings are instituted and will be used in determining the level of monetary penalty for informal settlements.</p>  <p>  (2) The record of violations <I>not </I>involved in formal proceedings will be expunged if there are no violations during a twenty-four (24) month period from the date of the most recent violation, or after thirty-six (36) months from the date of said violation, unless it was made a part of a formal disciplinary complaint.</p>  <p>  (e) <I>Summary of procedure </I>&mdash;(1) <I>Compilation of authority. </I>The rules defining misrepresentation, including misbranding, and for determining liability and disposition of violations are contained in the Act (7 U.S.C. 499 <I>et seq.), </I>in particular sections 2(5) and 8 (7 U.S.C. 449b(5) and 499h), &sect;46.45 of the Regulations (7 CFR 46.45), the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings Instituted By the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 <I>et seq. </I>), and in the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <I>et seq. </I>).</p>  <p>  (2) <I>Evidence of misrepresentation. </I>Evidence of misrepresentation or misbranding violations includes results of official inspections, audit findings, business records, or other documentation or testimony bearing on the subject. When a lot of fruits and vegetables has been officially inspected, and certification made that the descriptive markings on the container do not misrepresent the produce, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original finding (such as to grade, size, weight, etc.), the shipper/seller will <I>not </I>be charged with violation of the Act. However, the misrepresentation must be corrected before the lot is shipped, sold, or offered for resale.</p>  <p>  (3) <I>Warning letters. </I>When informal settlement of liability is appropriate, violators are given two written warnings and an opportunity to take preventive action before formal action is considered. Warning letters include an explanation of the requirements of the Act and recommendations of actions which the violator can take to avoid future violations.</p>  <p>  (4) <I>Informal sanctions. </I>Violations subsquent to the sending of the warning letters referred to above, other than flagrant violations, may be settled informally pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This procedure permits the violator to resolve the matter by payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to a schedule set out in lieu of a formal proceeding.</p>  <p>  (5) <I>Formal sanctions. </I>In cases involving repeated or flagrant violations of the Act, formal proceedings seeking the suspension or revocation of the violator's license may be instituted pursuant to the Rules of Practice governing such matters (7 CFR 1.130 <I>et seq. </I>). Except in cases of willfulness or where the public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, a violator must be given written warning and opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act before its license can be suspended or revoked (5 U.S.C. 551 <I>et seq. </I>). The warning letters referred to above serve this purpose. If formal proceedings are instituted, the violator is afforded an oral hearing, if requested, before an Administrative Law Judge, an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision to the Department's Judicial Officer, and a further opportunity to appeal an adverse final decision to the appropriate United States Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>  <p>  (6) <I>Use of record of misrepresentation. </I>A cumulative record of misrepresentation is maintained. It is used as a basis for determining whether a warning letter should be considered, and, if so, the amount of monetary penalty which is appropriate, or whether there is cause for instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or revocation of the violator's license. But after payment of a monetary penalty or after two years from the date of the last violation, no formal disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation.

Trust assets are to be preserved as a nonsegregated &ldquo;floating&rdquo; trust. Commingling of trust assets is contemplated.</p>  <p>  (c) <I>Trust benefits. </I>(1) When a seller, supplier or agent who has met the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, transfers ownership, possession, or control of goods to a commission merchant, dealer, or broker, it automatically becomes eligible to participate in the trust. Participants who preserve their rights to benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.</p>  <p>  (2) Any licensee, or person subject to license, who has a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce, and remit such funds to its principal, also has the duty to preserve its principal's rights to trust benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The responsibility for filing the notice to preserve the principal's rights is obligatory and cannot be avoided by the agent by means of a contract provision. Persons acting as agents also have the responsibility to negotiate contracts which entitle their principals to the protection of the trust provisions: <I>Provided, </I>That a principal may elect to waive its right to trust protection. To be effective, the waiver must be in writing and separate and distinct from any agency contract, must be signed by the principal prior to the time affected transactions occur, must clearly state the principal's intent to waive its right to become a trust beneficiary on a given transaction, or a series of transactions, and must include the date the agent's authority to act on the principal's behalf expires. In the event an agent having a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce and remit such funds to its principal fails to perform the duty of preserving its principal's rights to trust benefits, it may be held liable to the principal for damages. A principal employing a collect and remit agent must preserve its rights to trust benefits against such agent by filing appropriate notices with the agent.</p>  <p>  (d) <I>Trust maintenance. </I>(1) Commission merchants, dealers and brokers are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including dissipation of trust assets, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act, (7 U.S.C. 499b).</p>  <p>  (2) Agents who sell perishable agricultural commodities on behalf of a principal are required to preserve the principal's rights as a trust beneficiary as set forth in &sect;46.2(z), (aa) and paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including failure to give timely notice of intent to preserve trust benefits, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act, (7 U.S.C. 499b).</p>  <p>  (e) <I>Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits. </I>(1) The times for prompt accounting and prompt payment are set out in &sect;46.2(z) and (aa). Parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement in their records, and the times of payment must be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to the transaction.</p>  <p>  (2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to which a seller, supplier, or agent can agree and still qualify for coverage under the trust is 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined in &sect;46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p>  <p>  (3) The trust provisions do not apply to transactions between a cooperative association (as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), and its members.</p>  <p>  (4) The amount claimable against the trust by a beneficiary or grower will be the net amount due after allowable deductions of contemplated expenses or advances made in connection with the transaction by the commission merchant, dealer, or broker.</p>  <p>  (f) <I>Filing notice of intent to preserve trust benefits. </I>(1) Notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust must be in writing, must include the statement that it is a notice of intent to preserve trust benefits and must include information which establishes for each shipment:</p>  <p>  (i) The names and addresses of the trust beneficiary, seller-supplier, commission merchant, or agent and the debtor, as applicable,</p>  <p>  (ii) The date of the transaction, commodity, invoice price, and terms of payment (if appropriate),</p>  <p>  (iii) The date of receipt of notice that a payment instrument has been dishonored (if appropriate), and</p>  <p>  (iv) The amount past due and unpaid.</p>  <p>  (2) Timely filing of a notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust will be considered to have been made if written notice is given to the debtor within 30 calendar days:</p>  <p>  (i) After expiration of the time prescribed by which payment must be made pursuant to regulation,</p>  <p>  (ii) After expiration of such other time by which payment must be made as the parties have expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction, but not longer than the time prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or</p>  <p>  (iii) After the time the supplier, seller or agent has received notice that a payment instrument promptly presented for payment has been dishonored. Failures to pay within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section constitute defaults.</p>  <p>  (3) Licensees may choose an alternate method of preserving trust benefits from the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. Licensees may use their invoice or other billing statement as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, whether in documentary or electronic form, to preserve trust benefits. Alternately, the licensee's invoice or other billing statement, given to the buyer, must contain:</p>  <p>  (i) The statement: &ldquo;The perishable agricultural commodities listed on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of these commodities until full payment is received.&rdquo;; and</p>  <p>  (ii) The terms of payment if they differ from prompt payment set out in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and the parties have expressly agreed to such terms in writing before the affected transactions occur.</p>  <p>  (4) If the invoice or other billing statement is in electronic form, the licensee has met its requirement of giving the buyer notice of intent to preserve trust benefits on the face of the invoice or other billing statement if the electronic invoice or other billing statement containing the statement set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) is sent to the buyer and the electronic transmission can be verified. The licensee will be deemed to have given notice to the buyer of its intent to preserve trust benefits if the licensee can verify that the electronic invoice or other billing statement was sent to a third party electronic transaction vendor designated by the buyer. The licensee will have met the requirement of giving the buyer written notice of intent to preserve trust benefits using electronic means if it can verify that the electronic data invoice or other billing statement was transmitted to the buyer, or its designated electronic transaction vendor, irrespective of whether or not the buyer or third party vendor downloads or accepts the trust statement.</p>  <p>  (5) If a buyer conducts its transactions in perishable agricultural commodities using an electronic system, the buyer or its third party electronic vendor must allow sufficient space for the seller to include the required trust statement of intent to preserve trust benefits in the buyer's electronic invoices or other billing statement forms. A buyer or its designated third party electronic vendor must accept a seller's notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust using the required trust statement, whether in documentary or electronic form, as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
