<abstract>
This dataset represents soils of Wyoming at 1:100,000-
scale.  The layer contains 350 separate soils descriptions
across 23 Wyoming counties.  The layer was compiled
based on the five-factor soil forming model using
digital surficial geology, bedrock geology, and elevation.
This dataset will be more fully documented in 23 AES publications
scheduled for completion in winter of 99/00.  These publications
will use the designation AES Bulletin B-1071 followed by a two
letter abreviation for each county.
</abstract>
<purpose>
This layer was originally created specifically for use
in the Wyoming Ground-Water Vulnerability Mapping
Project being conducted at the Wyoming Water Resources
Center, a statewide study of aquifer vulnerability to
contamination from pesticides.  In that context, it was
to be used to assist in the generation of a rating map
of how soils affect aquifer sensitivity to surface
contaminants.
The Soils of Wyoming layers can be used, however, for many
other purposes.  It is intended to supplement other existing
1:100,000 scale digital natural resource layers of the
state.  Please see Use-Constraints for more details.

This data is currently in draft form and should not be used for
any purpose without first contacting the authors.  A final, usable
version will be produced in Summer99 and will include a full hardcopy
AES publication.  This dataset may not be redistributed or
repackaged in any form without the express written
consent of the University of Wyoming Spatial Data and
Visualization Center and the Department of Renewable Resources.
This map provides a generalized description of soils within
each county of Wyoming.  Soils are highly variable, both on a
regional basis (plains, mountains, basins) and locally with
changes in topography (north versus south slopes, side slopes
versus ridge crest or foot slope positions), vegetation, climate,
and geology.  This map should be used for broad scale planning
and general assessment of large areas of land.  It should not be
used for site specific interpretations such as site selection
for an underground fuel storage tank or the development of
management plans for individual farm fields.  Such site
intensive land uses require much more detailed soils information
than is provided by this map.

The Soils Map of Wyoming and the generalized soils maps of the
counties in Wyoming are derived maps based on the five soil
forming factors model first proposed in its entirety by the
Russian soil scientist Doukachev, in the 1880's. This model was
introduced broadly to American soil scientists by Hans Jenny
(Jenny 1941).  The five factors of soil formation are soil parent
material, climate, biota, topography, and time.  As Hudson (1992)
pointed out, soil surveying is an activity that conforms well to the
theories of paradigm-based science.  During detailed soil surveys,
field mapping is based on the projection of soil map unit concepts
onto the landscape, after which map unit composition and boundary
pLaement are subject to immediate field checking in the form of
soil pit excavation(s).  Generalized soils maps are often based on
either a process of consolidation of detailed soils maps, or on
projection of limited data from direct observation across a broad
area through use of soil-landscape models.  In the United States, the
model used to describe soil-landscape relationships is most commonly
the soil forming factor model.  The maps prepared for this project
were
prepared using current understanding of soil-landscape models and
available data in the form of published soil surveys, maps, and
reports
of the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the Forest Service, the
Bureau of Land Management, and numerous theses and scientific papers
published by the Wyoming Agricultural Experiment Station and the
University of Wyoming.
The soil map presented here differs from the STATSGO map developed by
the Natural Resource Conservation Service (National Cartographic and
GIS Center, 1998) in several ways.  The STATSGO maps were developed
by generalizing existing detailed soil surveys and were prepared on a
1:250,000-scale topographic map base.  The mapping units in the STATSGO
map contain from one to 21 components, and the soils components are
represented at the series level.  The STATSGO map provides a somewhat
more detailed description of the soils in the state, with consequent
complexity in interpretations.  The detailed maps from which the
STATSGO map was generalized were produced by numerous scientists over
a thirty year time span.  The surficial geology map of the state and
the state bedrock geology map were not available in electronic form
when these maps were produced and the original mapping was done on
aerial photographs.
The scale of 1:100,000 used for this map was specified by the larger
Wyoming Ground-Water Vulnerability Mapping Project (Hamerlinck and
Arneson 1998).  The maps are based on a simplification of the five soil
forming factor model.  Climate is proxied by elevation.  This was derived
from the 3-arc-second USGS Digital Elevation Model for the state.
There is a strong correspondence between elevation and precipitation in the
state, and temperature regimes can also generally be characterized by
elevation.  Vegetation is also closely tied to elevation, through its
effect on precipitation and temperature.   Three temperature regimes
are mapped in Wyoming: cryic in the higher mountains; frigid in the
foothills, the high plains along the Rocky Mountain front, low mountains
and high intermountain basins; and mesic in lower elevation basins and
the Great Plains See Appendix in the report for definitions of temperature
regimes). There are small areas of a fourth temperature regime (pergelic) at
elevations above 10,000 feet in the highest mountains in the state.
Soil parent material is derived from the digital version of the state
geology map (Green and Drouillard 1994) and the state surficial geology
map by Case, Arneson, and Hallberg (1998).  Vegetation is inferred from
climate, slope, and parent material.  Time, or soil age, is inferred
from elevation and surficial geology.  The topographic factor is inferred
from elevation, surficial geology and bedrock geology.  All the analysis
of these layers was conducted using conducted using ARC/INFO Geographic
Information System software on a Silicon Graphics UNIX workstation.

Big Horn County:  Mountains and high plateau.  Glaciated, Pre-
Cambraian Rocks.  Mountains.  Cryic, udic and aquic.
BHO1: Typic Dystrocryepts, loamy- skeletal, mixe- Typic
Haplocryalfs, loamy-skeletal, mixed-   Histic Cryaquepts, fine-
loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed.  Under continuous
coniferous forest (Lodgepole Pine, Englemann Spruce, Subalpine Fir,
and Douglas Fir) soils on geologic parent materials and surfaces
that are older than Pinedale are typically Haplocryalfs.  The
mountains were heavily glaciated during the Pinedale (Wisconsin)
glaciation and most surfaces are of Late Pinedale or Holocene age.
On these younger parent materials and/or surfaces, the dominant soils
are Dystrocrepts.  Cryaquepts occur in riparian areas.  Inclusions may
include Cryofluvents along small channels and Cryofibrists in
depressions in Pinedale moraines and along low gradient segments of
streams.  Cryoborolls and Cryumbrepts may occur in small openings in
the forest.
BHO2: Fluventic Haplocryolls, fine-loamy, mixed and Histic Cryaquepts,
fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed.  Haplocryolls occur
in mountain meadows which are predominately on south and west facing
slopes, and are often on finer textured parent materials than
surrounding forest soils.  Cryaquepts occur along riparian areas.
BHO3: Rock Outcrop, Lithic Cryorthents and Histic Dystrocryepts,
loamy-skeletal, mixed and Histic  Cryaquepts, fine-loamy over sandy
or sandy-skeletal, mixed.  Topography for this high elevation unit
is irregular, with Histic Dystrocryepts occurring under grass or grass
with scattered trees on small benches and low gradient segments of the
slope.  The Cryorthents are on very steep slopes and around the base of
rock outcrops.  The Cryaquepts occur along small riparian areas.
BHO4: Lithic Cryorthents, loamy-skeletal; Rock Outcrop; and Typic
Cryaquepts, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Thin Cryorthents
and bedrock outcrops dominate this landscape.  In narrow riparian areas
between steep slopes, Cryaquepts have developed in accumulations of fine
materials weathered from the surrounding uplands.
BHO5: Typic Haplocryalfs, Typic Haplocryolls, and Typic Dystrocryepts,
loamy-skeletal, mixed  and Histic Cryaquepts, fine-loamy over sandy or
sandy-skeletal, mixed.  On stable slopes which are older than Pinedale
(Late Wisconsin), the predominate soils are Haplocryalfs. Haplocryolls
occur under mountain meadow vegetation and are most common on south
facing slopes and on convex interfluves.  Dystrocryepts occur on slopes
greater than 40%, and on Pinedale and younger surfaces (Pinedale tills
and Holocene surfaces). Cryaquepts are found along narrow riparian areas.
BHO7: Rock outcrop, Typic Lithic Dystrocryepts and Lithic Cryorthents,
loamy-skeletal, mixed.  These residual landscapes present a rugged
appearance with 50 to 60% of the area covered by rock outcrop.  The
thin Dystrocryepts and Cryorthents occur intermingled with the bedrock.
BH10: HisticCryaquepts fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed
and Histic  Dystrocryepts, loamy-skeletal, mixed.  Like BH03 except
less rock outcrop.
Big Horn County: Bighorn Basin.  Intermountain Basin.  Mesic, aridic.
BHO8: Typic Haplargids and Typic Haplocalcids, fine-loamy over sandy
or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic and Torriorthents, fine-loamy and
coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic.
BH09: Typic Torripsaments, mesic.  These soils are on stabilized dunes.
They show little horizon development; thin A horizons are the most
apparent change from the parent material (stabilized dune sand).
BH11: Typic Torriorthents, loamy, mixed, mesic and Rock Outcrop.  These
soils form in a variety of sedimentary parent materials which are
exposed along the perimeter of the basin.  Soils are shallow or
moderately deep.
BH12: Typic Torriorthents, fine, smectitic, mesic and Rock Outcrop.
These soils form over fine textured Cretaceous bedrock.  Outcrops of
shale occur as small badlands; outcrops of coarser textured rock
support long, narrow ridges with finer textured soils along the flanks.
BH13: Typic Haplargids and Typic Natrargids, fine-loamy or coarse-
loamy, mixed, mesic.  These soils occur on low gradient colluvial
slopes (less than 15%) and reflect the texture of the underlying
bedrock as well as the effects of slope processes.
BH14: Typic Torrifluvents, sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic and Typic
Haplocambids, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic.
These soils occur on Holocene age terraces and slopes along small
streams.  The Torrifluvents occupy the first and second terraces
above the modern channel.
Big Horn County: Foothills. Frigid, ustic.
BH15: Typic Haplustolls and Typic Haplustalfs, loamy-skeletal, mixed,
frigid.  These soils occur in the foothills along the flank of the
higher mountains and represent a transition from the basins to the
higher mountains.  Haploborolls are common on south and west facing
slopes; Haploboralfs predominate on north facing slopes and on both
canyon walls of narrow canyons.
BH16: Aridic Argiustolls, fine-loamy and fine-loamy over sandy or
sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid and Ustic Haplocambids, fine-loamy,
mixed, frigid.  These soils have developed along strean channels and
on local alluvium in lower slope positions.  The Haplocambids are
are on younger or less stable landscape segments.
BH17: Aridic Argiustolls, fine-loamy, mixed and Ustic Haplocambids,
fine, smectitic, frigid.  These soils have developed on shales,
claystones or fine textured alluvium.
BH18: Ustic Haplocalcids,  Lithic Ustorthents and Typic Calciustolls,
loamy-skeletal, frigid.  These soils occur along dissected canyons
on clacareous parent materials.  The Calciustolls are on landscape
segments where available soil water is enhanced; the Ustorthents are
on steep slopes.
BH06: Fluventic Haplaquolls and Torrifluvents, fine-loamy over sandy
or sandy-skeletal, frigid.  These soils occur along small alluvial
channels.
