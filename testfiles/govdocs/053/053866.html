      <p><strong><u><a name="summary" id="summary"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</u></strong> </p>
      <p>The Waterfront Regeneration Trust (the Trust) illustrates the innovative 
        partnerships that not-for-profit organizations can create in the cleanup 
        and reuse of contaminated properties. Established in 1988 as an outgrowth 
        of the Royal Commission on the Future of the Toronto Waterfront, the Trust 
        has completed over 80 projects along the shore of Lake Ontario by &quot;applying 
        an &#145;ecosystem&#146; approach and by bringing people, ideas and resources 
        together to invest in waterfront revitalization(1).&quot; Several of the 
        Trust&#146;s successful brownfields projects are presented in more depth 
        as part of this case study; see the discussions of Cobourg Harbor, Toronto 
        Hydro, and the West Don Lands(2). </p>
      <p><strong>The Trust as a Broker</strong></p>
      <p>Depending on the project, the Trust can act as facilitator, mediator, 
        or technical consultant as it helps the property owner, developer, community, 
        provincial and local governments, and regulators bridge their different 
        perspectives. Their role as a broker was instrumental in the creation 
        of the Waterfront Trail, a 325 kilometer greenway/bike trail that stretches 
        nearly the entire northern shore of Lake Ontario. The Trust worked with 
        the 28 municipalities on the segments of the trail that passed through 
        their communities. Many of the segments involved properties with various 
        levels of environmental contamination. Through the trail&#146;s frequent 
        intersections with contaminated sites, the Trust developed an expertise 
        in the intricacies of brownfields redevelopment. </p>
      <p><strong>The Ecosystem Planning Approach </strong></p>
      <p>Another unique characteristic of the Trust is its commitment to ecosystem 
        planning -- the integration of community, ecological, and economic goals. 
        Its ecosystem planning approach permeates virtually all Trust activities 
        and projects. Adopted as part of the Royal Commission&#146;s original 
        mission, the Trust&#146;s projects aim to integrate the management and 
        conservation of natural resources with the redevelopment of contaminated 
        properties. Recently the Trust published a major report, Greening the 
        Toronto Port Lands, that creates a design template for building green 
        infrastructure throughout Toronto&#146;s former industrial waterfront. 
        It provides a model that can easily be applied to large urban areas well 
        beyond the shores of Lake Ontario. Moreover, the Trust&#146;s efforts 
        in creating the Waterfront Trail provide it with prime opportunities to 
        promote its themes of regeneration and ecosystem planning. </p>
      <p><strong>The Local Land Use Process </strong></p>
      <p>The Trust uses the municipal land use planning and development processes 
        as its focal point for brownfield redevelopment. The intended future use 
        for a contaminated property is now the bridge between cleanup requirements 
        and redevelopment potential in this new era of risk-based cleanups. Since 
        land use is the primary domain of local governments, nearly all of the 
        Trust&#146;s brownfields projects involve creating strong partnerships 
        with municipal officials. </p>
      <p>For example, the local Waterfront Trail projects, were spearheaded by 
        municipalities. Although no provincial or state legislation required these 
        local governments to adopt or formally incorporate the Trust&#146;s greenway 
        strategy into local law, many of the municipalities have revised their 
        official land use plans to include the strategy and its ecosystem planning 
        principles. From the municipal government perspective, it makes both environmental 
        and economic sense to follow a local land use plan that seeks to revitalize 
        contaminated land through the integration of the community, ecological, 
        and economic goals. </p>
      <p><strong>Recent Projects and Future Directions</strong> </p>
      <p>The Trust and its staff continue their involvement in a number of community 
        redevelopment efforts.(3) For example, the Trust is helping build consensus 
        around Toronto&#146;s bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics that could include 
        the redevelopment of waterfront properties for Olympic venues. </p>
      <p>In April 1998, the Trust convened over 100 experts from Canada, the US, 
        and Europe to discuss brownfields redevelopment issues and compare the 
        Ontario and Toronto experiences with other best practices(4).</p>
      <p>The Trust is also working on an international waterfront gateway strategy 
        for Buffalo, NY and Fort Erie, Ontario. This work has been commissioned 
        by the two cities and marks a new era in international cooperation that 
        will benefit the economy and the environment. </p>
      <p>Over the next two or three years, the Trust plans to continue its work 
        with national and provincial environmental regulators to improve the certainty 
        of regulations and rules in the cleanup and redevelopment process. Moreover, 
        the Trust will focus further activities on improving the climate for private 
        investment as the best means to dispel the &quot;fence and guard dog&quot; 
        mentality of handling contaminated properties. </p>

        <u><b><a name="stage" id="stage"></a>SETTING THE STAGE: HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</b></u> 
    </p>
      <p>The Waterfront Regeneration Trust (the Trust) is a leader in the redevelopment 
        of brownfields in the Toronto region. Established in 1992 as a quasi-public 
        &quot;agency at arms length,&quot; the Trust is currently evolving into 
        an independent, entrepreneurial not-for-profit organization. </p>
      <p><strong>The Royal Commission - Creation of the Ecosystem Planning Approach 
        </strong></p>
      <p>The Trust was borne out of recommendations made by the Royal Commission 
        on the Future of the Toronto Waterfront in 1991. (5) In 1988 the Royal 
        Commission was given a three year mandate to make recommendations regarding 
        federal lands and environmental issues related to the waterfront, and 
        possible use of federal lands and facilities for Olympic purposes. (6)</p>
      <p>In 1992 the Royal Commission completed its analysis of the environmental 
        and economic issues facing the entire North Shore of Lake Ontario. The 
        commission adopted an ecosystem planning approach which included both 
        local government planning authorities and conservation authorities.(7) 
        The goal of an ecosystem approach is to integrate community, ecology, 
        and economy, rather than isolate these issues. The Royal Commission emphasized 
        collaborative approaches to decision making, and put forward nine guiding 
        principles for the Toronto Waterfront: Clean, Green, Accessible, Connected, 
        Open, Useable, Diverse, Affordable and Attractive. These principles were 
        meant to &quot;capture the public's expectations and hopes for the waterfront, 
        and guide the work of the Trust and its partners.&quot; (8)</p>
      <p>The creation of a waterfront regeneration trust was a specific recommendation 
        of the Royal Commission to which the Canadian government quickly responded 
        (9). The Trust was officially established in 1992 to implement the recommendations 
        of the Royal Commission. Given the history of jurisdictional battles over 
        Toronto&#146;s waterfront, the Trust was seen as the ideal vehicle to 
        overcome the waterfront&#146;s past controversies. The Trust&#146;s chief 
        objective was to develop a greenway along the entire northern shore of 
        Ontario, a distance of 325 Kilometers. </p>
      <p><strong>Executive Leadership and Vision </strong></p>
      <p>At the helm of the Trust is David Crombie, former mayor of Toronto and 
        federal cabinet minister of Indian and Northern Affairs. Given his previous 
        local government experience as Mayor of Toronto, Crombie is familiar with 
        the issues and the players surrounding Toronto&#146;s waterfront. He not 
        only brings experience to the Trust, but dynamic leadership and vision 
        about the waterfront&#146;s future. Crombie and his staff possess the 
        talent to bring diverse parties together to seek collaborative solutions 
        -- a critical skill in the redevelopment of brownfields. </p>
      <p><strong>The Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail - A Link to Brownfields Redevelopment 
        </strong></p>
      <p>The Waterfront Trail, opened in 1995, stretches a total of 325 kilometers 
        along Lake Ontario&#146;s northern shore. The trail was the Trust&#146;s 
        first major project, as they assisted 28 municipalities with the portions 
        of the trail owned within each locality. Because the overarching goal 
        of the trail is to connect communities, the Trust has been careful to 
        avoid activities that could be construed by local governments as undue 
        interference or a &quot;land grab&quot;. Parts of the trail pass through 
        private industrial land, yet none traverse through private residential 
        properties. It is intersections with these frequently contaminated industrial 
        properties that forms the confluence between the trail and brownfields 
        development. </p>
      <p>The trail is not just a bike and walking path, but a band of interconnected 
        communities that embodies the vision of the Royal Commission to develop 
        a &quot;continuous trail system [that] guarantees public access to these 
        natural and open spaces&quot;.(10) The ecosystem approach incorporates 
        the natural environment and watershed planning with traditional economic 
        development strategies, zoning, and land use planning. As a result, one 
        of the Trust&#146;s main challenges in implementing the trail was confronting 
        the gridlock that can result from this approach of crossing traditional 
        local government boundaries and jurisdiction. </p>
      <p>The Trust also uses the Waterfront Trail to spearhead its multi-faceted 
        activities and projects. Some of the Trust&#146;s outreach activities 
        have included investors roundtables, ecological literacy, speaking engagements, 
        technical work planning reports, and a well-stocked resource center. In 
        addition, the Trust publishes a newsletter with a circulation of 12,000. 
        They have also established a programmatic connection with the University 
        of Toronto and several other universities in Ontario. </p>
      <p><strong>Trust as Broker </strong></p>
      <p>The Trust serves as a catalyst for action as well as a coordinator of 
        ideas and resources to ignite economic and environmental renewal. The 
        Trust brings extra value to brownfields redevelopment efforts by developing 
        partnerships among all of the stakeholders. As a result of the Trust&#146;s 
        involvement, the development process is more collaborative, and both the 
        economic and environmental benefits of regeneration are better articulated. 
      </p>
      <p>The Trust performs well in these capacities for several reasons. First, 
        the staff at the Trust have backgrounds in municipal governmen; they know 
        the local land use planning and development process. Second, they have 
        strong relationships with and understand the different perspectives of 
        the various stakeholders, whether they are municipal officials, provincial 
        regulators, community groups, or private developers. Third, the Trust&#146;s 
        successful track record gives it credibility when it acts as an independent 
        third-party mediator or convenor. &quot;Before we embarked on this process 
        with the Waterfront Regeneration Trust, there was nothing but conflict 
        and anger between the community and the company, with the municipality 
        caught in the middle.&quot; (11)</p>
      <p><b><u><a name="framework" id="framework"></a>REGULATORY AND PROGRAMMATIC FRAMEWORK</u></b> 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Local Land Use Planning and Zoning</strong> </p>
      <p>Compared with other brownfields redevelopment programs, the Trust emphasizes 
        the local land use process as the framework for its projects and activities. 
        Instead of focusing just upon national or provincial cleanup guidelines 
        and legislation, the Trust astutely understands that decisions about a 
        property&#146;s intended use are at the crux of successful brownfields 
        cleanup and redevelopment. Under Ontario&#146;s new site-specific risk-based 
        cleanup policies, the amount and type of residual contamination depends 
        on the intended uses for the site. Future land use also drives a site&#146;s 
        redevelopment potential (i.e., the rate of return on housing is generally 
        less than a downtown retail business or entertainment center).</p>
      <p>The Trust understands its strategic role as a convenor or facilitator 
        in the local land use process. It recognizes that decisions about cleanup 
        and redevelopment must include meaningful participation of all of stakeholders 
        in the community. For example, participating municipalities are highly 
        involved in creating the greenway strategy for their segment of the Waterfront 
        trail (12). As a result of this high level of participation, municipalities 
        develop a strong commitment to follow the principles of ecosystem planning. 
        Despite the absence of formal legislation demanding that municipalities 
        adopt the greenway strategy, many municipalities have revised their Official 
        Plans (13) to include these ecosystem principles.</p>
      <p><strong>The Cleanup Process - The Role of the Trust and Provincial Government</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>Compared with the U.S. EPA and state environmental departments, the Canadian 
        national and provincial environmental agencies do not play a high-profile 
        regulatory role in the cleanup of brownfields. Unlike its American counterparts, 
        Ontario&#146;s Ministry of the Environment does not establish formal cleanup 
        standards by promulgating regulations. Instead, administrative guidelines 
        are issued that establish cleanup levels or criteria for over 117 chemicals 
        that might pollute the soil or infiltrate below the surface soil or the 
        groundwater. (15) Issued by the Ministry in the summer of 1996, these 
        guidelines set forth three general classifications for the cleanup of 
        contaminated properties: [1] Background Levels; [2] Generic Criteria; 
        and [3] Risk-Based Site-Specific Criteria (e.g. that requires Ministry 
        review and approval). While these classifications give landowners and 
        other stakeholders direction and flexibility, they must still adequately 
        protect human health and the environment, similar to their counterparts 
        in the United States. Brownfields remediation, therefore, is not driven 
        by strict adherence to federal or state cleanup statutes and regulations, 
        rather it is set by administrative policies. (16) </p>
      <p>Ontario&#146;s Ministry of the Environment largely relies on the private 
        sector and market place to perform the cleanups as an integral part of 
        the development process. With increased scientific knowledge and a buoyant 
        market place, Ontario&#146;s provincial government has delegated responsibilities 
        for overseeing brownfields restoration and reuse to municipalities. As 
        a result of this move toward decentralization, the provincial government 
        is not directly involved with brownfields cleanup today (unless legal 
        compliance is an issue). In fact, Canadian financial institutions actually 
        now play a greater role in cleanup, given their required review for loan 
        approval. </p>
      <p>Because this jurisdictional shift is still in progress, confusion may 
        occur on the respective roles and responsibilities of the environmental 
        regulator.(17) Given the potential for confusion, the Trust focuses its 
        efforts within a particular project to ensure that all parties are clear 
        about each other&#146;s roles and responsibilities. </p>
      <p>The Trust also continues with its prominent policy role of advising the 
        provincial government regarding necessary guidance for the environmental 
        cleanup of contaminated properties.(18) They are currently working closely 
        with the Environment Ministry and other stakeholders to develop guidance 
        for municipalities to integrate the cleanup criteria into their local 
        land use planning and zoning processes. </p>
      <p><b><u><a name="examples" id="examples"></a>PROJECT EXAMPLES</u></b> </p>
      <p>The Trust has facilitated the implementation of approximately 80 projects 
        on the Waterfront Trail over a five year period. Of the $37 million invested 
        in these sites, $12 million was contributed by the Provincial government 
        and $25 million was contributed by municipalities, conservation authorities, 
        service clubs and the private sector.(19) The following are several samples 
        from the Trust&#146;s portfolio of projects. </p>
      <p><strong>Cobourg Harbor</strong> </p>
      <p>Located one hour east of Toronto, along the shores of Lake Ontario, the 
        Town of Cobourg today is a flourishing community and quaint tourist destination.(20) 
        With the help of the Trust and the collaboration among local governments 
        and a local private developer, the regeneration of Cobourg illustrates 
        how small communities can overcome the industrial legacy of contaminated 
        waterfront land.(21) Similar to many communities on both shores of the 
        Great Lakes, Cobourg&#146;s waterfront is now the center of new economic 
        opportunities in the form of both residential and commercial development. 
      </p>
      <p>Originally constructed in the 1840s, Cobourg harbor, like many mid-size 
        ports along the Great Lakes&#146; transportation network, prospered from 
        the heavy industrial uses along its waterfront. Immediately following 
        World War II, however, industrial activity significantly declined throughout 
        the 1950s.(22) According to local developer James Hoffman, &quot;Cobourg 
        prospered because of its natural harbor and marine commerce, but as the 
        economy changed, people turned their backs on the water&quot;.(23) Many 
        of these industries turned their backs on Cobourg as they left the waterfront 
        strewn with abandoned warehouses, oil storage tanks, coal fields, railway 
        tracks, and contaminated lands. Local developer and engineer James Hoffman, 
        howwever, did not turn his back, but rather chose to seize this development 
        opportunity. (24)</p>
      <p>In 1989, the Town approved a Harbor Area Secondary Plan to guide redevelopment 
        of the waterfront. The plan emphasized support of economic development 
        activities in the downtown while maintaining Cobourg&#146;s character. 
        Early on, Hoffman realized the Waterfront Trail was an amenity that would 
        bring value to the overall waterfront and his concepts for its redevelopment. 
        Within this context, Hoffman began his brownfields redevelopment efforts 
        to acquire the former McAsphalt Oil Company property, a two-acre parcel 
        adjacent to three other abandoned properties (25).</p>
      <p>Since contamination problems existed across several parcels, Hoffman 
        and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment approached the Trust in the 
        early 1990s to help facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment. The Ministry&#146;s 
        thoughts were straightforward -- they needed an outside facilitator to 
        help address the cross-boundary contamination, and thus sought an objective, 
        informed third party, rather than a regulator or property owner. From 
        Hoffman&#146;s perspective, it was critical to assemble all of the stakeholders 
        from the outset to generate initial interest and momentum for the cleanup 
        and redevelopment of the site. Yet, it would be difficult for him alone, 
        as the developer, to get buy-in from all of the stakeholders without the 
        assistance of a credible support group. In this case, the Trust fit the 
        needs of both the environmental regulator and the developer. </p>
      <p>The initial meetings focused upon the environmental condition of the 
        site and possible cleanup strategies. The Trust brought Hoffman together 
        with the existing landowners, the Town of Cobourg, the Ministry of the 
        Environment, and local residents. As part of the cleanup negotiations, 
        the community voiced an important concern of mitigating odors from the 
        old tank farms. During the preliminary discussions two of the property 
        owners near the McAsphalt site, Imperial Oil and Ultramar, initially resisted 
        the cleanup option. Given the high cost of remediation relative to the 
        market value of the land and the general perception of possible legal 
        liability, they thought warehousing their properties might minimize their 
        overall risks. Eventually, the Trust&#146;s mediation skills and Hoffman&#146;s 
        persistence paid off. The two oil companies agreed to take care of the 
        contamination caused by their facilities by using air sparging (26).</p>
      <p>The Trust&#146;s role as mediator was successful, preventing possible 
        litigation and maintaining Trail connectivity. Today Cobourg residents 
        live in 40 condominiums on the former McAsphalt Oil site. &quot;The Waterfront 
        Regeneration Trust has done a lot to unlock Cobourg&#146;s potential, 
        both for economic and environmental improvement.&amp;quot(27); Hoffman continues 
        with his brownfields redevelopment efforts by acquiring a total of 14 
        acres along Cobourg&#146;s Harbor with plans to remediate and develop 
        additional sites nearby. (28)</p>

      <p>Complete regeneration of a community, such as Cobourg, cannot happen 
        without the leadership of local government and the creation of partnerships. 
        As part of its effort to redevelop these contaminated properties, the 
        town of Cobourg commenced an aggressive program to build new public infrastructure 
        and amenities along the waterfront(33). A landscape architect designed 
        beach structures to encourage people to use the beach. The town hired 
        staff and equipment to clean the beach daily during prime tourist season. 
        Cobourg also built a brand new marina, twice the size of its predecessor, 
        in addition to a campground (34). Plans were made to construct extensive 
        walkways that would connect Cobourg&#146;s historic downtown with the 
        waterfront and the Trust&#146;s Waterfront Trail. Thanks to further help 
        from the Trust, renovations of the area behind the old town hall are now 
        in place to include a pedestrian square with space for shops and restaurants. 
        Wayne Deveau, Director of Community Services for the Town of Cobourg, 
        aptly remarked, &quot;next to our citizens, our waterfront is our greatest 
        asset.&quot; </p>
      <p><strong>The Area-wide Soil and Ground Water Management Plan for Toronto&#146;s 
        Port Lands</strong> </p>
      <p>For over eighty years, Toronto&#146;s central waterfront served as the 
        home to many of its heavy industries. Like many ports on the Great Lakes, 
        this area is going through an economic and environmental transition. Once 
        a bustling manufacturing, bulk storage, and shipping center, changes in 
        the global market place have caused a dramatic shift in Toronto&#146;s 
        waterfront activities. New high-tech industries, recycling centers, and 
        entertainment enterprises are starting to emerge on the abandoned sites 
        of former oil storage, scrap metal yards, and manufacturing plants(35). 
      </p>
      <p>The Port Land&#146;s history of intense industrial usage has, unfortunately, 
        left behind a legacy of environmental contamination in both the soil and 
        groundwater. Many of these companies adopted a common practice of filling 
        in the lake to provide more land for these industrial uses(36). While 
        chemical contamination that exceeds the MOE&#146;s criteria is the exception, 
        the Port Lands commonly include excessive levels of lead, constituents 
        of gasoline, pesticides, and PCBs. </p>
      <p>Given its close proximity from the heart of downtown Toronto, with access 
        to major transportation routes and adjacent to some of the area&#146;s 
        best parklands and beaches, &quot;Toronto&#146;s Port Lands are strategically 
        located for investment.&quot;(37) Four hundred twenty acres of the Port 
        Lands is publicly owned by the Toronto Economic Development Corporation 
        (TEDCO)(38). TEDCO is the City of Toronto&#146;s primary agency for bringing 
        economic activity back to the port area through new development and strategic 
        environmental restoration (39).</p>
      <p /></p>
         
      <p><strong>The Port Land&#146;s Area-wide Soil and Ground Water Management 
        Plan</strong></p>
      <p>In preparing a cleanup plan for its first brownfields redevelopment project 
        in 1992, TEDCO soon recognized that it needed a different approach because 
        of two major problems in this area: (1) groundwater existing close to 
        the surface; and (2) the migration of contamination from adjacent sites. 
        These challenges made it difficult for TEDCO to move forward with its 
        cleanup and redevelopment plans on a site-by-site basis. Progress on this 
        initial brownfields project for Toronto Hydro initially stalled. Instead 
        of proceeding with lengthy and complex individual cleanup plans, TEDCO 
        was able to convince the City of Toronto and the Ministry of Environment 
        that preparation of an area-wide soil and ground water management plan 
        would be sufficient for individual projects within this area. </p>
      <p>The management plan establishes an &quot;environmental road map for the 
        assessment and restoration of soil and ground water conditions based on 
        the specific biophysical conditions of the area and intended land use.&quot;(40) 
        This innovative area-wide approach has two main components: an area-wide 
        monitoring program and the Individual Site Initiative.(41) The plan now 
        provides TEDCO and its tenants with a &quot;decision-making framework 
        that is based on risk management, information sharing, and cooperation 
        between interested parties.&quot;(42)</p>
      <p>In October 1997, the area-wide plan was formally endorsed by TEDCO, the 
        City of Toronto, and the Ministry of Environment through an official memorandum 
        of understanding (MOU). The MOU establishes a greater level of regulatory 
        certainty for all parties by setting forth a clear process for development 
        approvals and minimizing the confusion of overlapping municipal and provincial 
        rules. Under the MOU, developers would no longer have to negotiate with 
        two levels of government, but can deal directly with the municipality. 
        TEDCO now uses this soil and ground water management plan as an integral 
        part of its overall redevelopment strategy for the Port Lands.(43)</p>
      <p><strong>The Trust&#146;s Role in Building Consensus Around the Area-Wide 
        Plan</strong></p>
      <p>Development of the area-wide soil and ground water plan and the public 
        participation process was managed for TEDCO by the Waterfront Trust.(44) 
        The Trust built consensus by designing a collaborative process headed 
        by a steering committee that included representatives from the banks and 
        financial sector, private developers, tenants, and landowners, municipal 
        authorities, and provincial regulators. At critical stages in the planning 
        process, the Trust held two public workshops to broaden the level of public 
        involvement and participation.(45)</p>
      <p>Compared with some of its other projects, the Trust adopted more of a 
        leadership role in this area, educating the mayor&#146;s office on both 
        the need for public discussion and private-sector influence on the cleanup 
        strategy. Each week the Trust would contact the mayor&#146;s office to 
        monitor the issues and evaluate the community&#146;s stance. Because of 
        the Trust&#146;s involvement and its efforts towards community participation, 
        the public&#146;s level of trust and confidence increased. Subsequently, 
        elected officials were able to push the provincial government more than 
        they might have otherwise, and cleanup proceeded despite the absence of 
        official guidelines.</p>
      <p>Given the Ministry&#146;s negotiations over the new cleanup guidelines, 
        the Trust knew that industries would be closely watching the outcome of 
        this project for its practical applications to other cleanups. Although 
        these groups may have traditionally been wary of sharing information with 
        each other, the consensus building process helped facilitate open communication 
        and was critical to ensuring success. The Trust&#146;s involvement also 
        helped investors understand the dynamics of the project and lend their 
        financial support. Through a Trust-sponsored &quot;investors roundtable&quot;, 
        TEDCO was able to attract financial participation for its brownfields 
        projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Toronto Hydro Service Center -- Risk-Based Remediation Works</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>For sixty years Shell Canada operated a 12 acre blending plant, fuel 
        storage facility, and distribution center in Toronto&#146;s Port Lands.(46) 
        As industrial restructuring occurred in the region, Shell found that it 
        no longer needed this facility. By 1992 Shell&#146;s lease on the land 
        with TEDCO was about to expire. About the same time, Toronto Hydro, a 
        municipal utility corporation, was looking for a site to consolidate its 
        metro-wide training and customer service operations. With a potential 
        tenant and site on the horizon, TEDCO, Shell, and Toronto Hydro were motivated 
        to expedite the site remediation and redevelopment.</p>
      <p>Initial site assessments, however, indicated that remediation would be 
        complex and costly. The site was contaminated with fuels, lube oils, pesticides, 
        and traces of arsenic, lead and other heavy metals. Preliminary plans 
        would require the removal of an estimated 63,000 cubic meters of soil 
        to meet provincial cleanup standards for industrial and commercial use. 
        The costs for such a comprehensive cleanup were estimated at more than 
        $10 million.(47)</p>
      <p>Following consultation with Ontario&#146;s Ministry of the Environment 
        (MOE), TEDCO agreed to allow Shell to undertake a site-specific risk assessment 
        approach for cleaning the site, with Shell retaining ultimate legal and 
        financial responsibility for any future cleanup.(48) In order to avail 
        themselves of the risk-based cleanup criteria, the Ministry required the 
        parties to perform a series of epidemiological studies to determine the 
        potential human health risks.</p>
      <p>Shell took the lead in paying for the removal and treatment of almost 
        55,000 tons of contaminated soils.(49) About twenty percent of the soil 
        was treated using low temperature thermal desorption and then returned 
        to the site. The soil containing arsenic and pesticides was disposed of 
        at a licensed landfill. A Waterloo Barrier was also installed along the 
        boundaries of the property to prevent contaminants from other sites from 
        entering the property and recontaminating the soils. Another concern was 
        the potential build up of combustible gases underneath the property. Toronto 
        Hydro installed a system to collect and dissipate the gas, however, the 
        monitor for this system has never been activated so far.(50)</p>
      <p>The cleanup, which included treatment and recycling of contaminated soils, 
        cost a little more than $5 million. This represents a savings of almost 
        fifty percent (50%) from the original estimates while also ensuring the 
        protection of human health and the environment.(51) Furthermore, the roles 
        and responsibilities for long-term monitoring and the use and design of 
        the facilities cannot change without prior approval of TEDCO, the municipality 
        and the Ministry of the Environment. Today a service center and employee 
        training facility exists on the site, employing over 1000 people.(52)</p>
      <p>Over the past six years, TEDCO has completed five major redevelopment 
        projects that have generated the following environmental and economic 
        benefits:</p>
      <p><br />
        Area restored to productive use: 61.5 acres <br />
        Sq. Footage of new space built: 710,000 <br />
        New jobs on former brownfields sites: 1,377 <br />
        Construction jobs created: 720 <br />
        Value of construction: $60 million <br />
        New Property Tax Assessments (1997): $2.71 million(53)<br />
    A &quot;Green&quot; Redevelopment Plan for the Port Lands </p>
      <p>Beyond its initial success with the area-wide approach and the successful 
        redevelopment of Toronto Hydro&#146;s site, the Trust realized that other 
        redevelopment projects in the port area would confront many of the same 
        issues. A redevelopment plan based on sound ecosystem planning principles 
        might provide the port lands and TEDCO, as its primary property owner, 
        with a comprehensive approach.(54) The Trust noted several outstanding 
        issues and goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preserving 4,500 existing jobs </li>
        <li>Determining jurisdictional authority following the change in ownership 
          from the port to TEDCO </li>
        <li>Creating a vision for the area</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At this preliminary stage, the Trust is working with neighborhoods to 
        identify their unique characteristics in order to distinguish them from 
        other communities in the city. One of the early outcomes of this envisioning 
        process is the community&#146;s decision to use green infrastructure as 
        a key part of the redevelopment framework. </p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics of Green Infrastructure</strong> </p>
      <p>Green infrastructure includes both traditional recreational opportunities 
        and habitat and natural resource protection. It blends urban ecological 
        functions with green alternatives. Examples of green infrastructure employed 
        by the Waterfront Regeneration Trust include utilizing wetlands and other 
        non-structural methods as a means of flood control and creating networks 
        of green corridors that give wildlife freedom of movement and recreational 
        benefits to citizens. The Trust&#146;s work in this area of infrastructure 
        is on the cutting edge of municipal infrastructure development. </p>
      <p>The Trust&#146;s new publication, Greening Toronto&#146;s Port Lands, 
        provides municipalities with the framework of how green infrastructure 
        would look and function within the city&#146;s public domain. Key principles 
        include providing a multi-functional framework for development, protecting 
        biodiversity, creating biological linkages, recognizing watershed contexts, 
        reinforcing sense of place, and involving the community.(55) The following 
        functions provide the basis for recognizing these principles: </p>
      <p>Improve Environmental Quality <br />
        Resotre Natural Habitat <br />
        Enhance Recreational Opportunities <br />
    Enhance Urban Design(56)</p>
      <p>Providing a framework for green infrastructure is only the beginning, 
        however. The next step is designing a process to bring this green vision 
        into reality. The Trust&#146;s strategy is to approach the municipal planners 
        to obtain their conceptual approval. Subsequently, the public consultation 
        process is used as the vehicle for building consensus and support for 
        green infrastructure projects. The Trust assists municipalities in adopting 
        green infrastructure elements into their official land use plans, rather 
        than lament the lack of green infrastructure on an individual project 
        basis. </p>
      <p><strong>West Don Lands</strong> </p>
      <p>At one time the West Don area was a thriving community with a compatible 
        mix of industries and residential uses. As these businesses declined, 
        they left a familiar legacy of contamination and polluted soils that impeded 
        possible efforts to revitalize the community. </p>
      <p>In the late 1980s, preliminary ideas for redeveloping this industrial 
        area which is located inland from the port on the Don River, included 
        building affordable &quot;social&quot; housing as well as a mix of market-rate 
        housing. The Province of Ontario offered the City of Toronto funding guarantees 
        to create a residential community if the city would act as their agent 
        in appropriating the land. Even though the land market hit bottom in 1989-1990, 
        lowering land acquisition costs, the removal of the contaminated soils 
        for this site would cost $140 million or more. The cleanup was further 
        complicated by the property&#146;s location in the flood plain. Given 
        these market, environment, and other obstacles, initial redevelopment 
        efforts stalled.</p>
      <p>In June 1990, the Provincial government resumed discussions with Toronto, 
        offering the city two guarantees: (1) the city&#146;s liability would 
        not exceed $20 million under any circumstance; and (2) the city would 
        not accrue any costs if the province canceled the project. After further 
        negotiations in 1992, the provincial government did indeed cancel the 
        project, having spent $350 million dollars to extinguish a declining industrial 
        community. The site remained abandoned and derelict, surrounded on all 
        sides by older residential neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, the Trust agreed to facilitate a redevelopment plan 
        for the West Don Lands. The Trust&#146;s action plan sought to create 
        critical links between the residential neighborhoods and the waterfront 
        through a grid of green infrastructure. Given this rather innovative concept, 
        it was necessary to educate the developers and investors about the tenets 
        of green infrastructure. The Trust&#146;s outreach efforts also coincided 
        with Toronto&#146;s need to update its Official Plan, a process which 
        takes place every five years. By using the municipal planning process 
        as the vehicle, the Trust was able to generate sufficient support for 
        the West Don plan. The City Council adopted the West Don plan and included 
        it in the Official Plan for Toronto.</p>
      <p>In practice, this means that all development in the West Dons must comply 
        with the goals of green infrastructure, and any party that disagrees with 
        these requirements must prove why they are unable to use green infrastructure. 
        Adoption of this green redevelopment plan was possible because of the 
        consensus created among the community, political and financial players, 
        industry, and local government.</p>

        the role of the Canadian government in Toronto's overall redevelopment 
        scheme</p>
      <p>6. The report also looked at several of the municipal entities with formal

        in handling the integration of land use planning and environmental cleanup 
        for three reasons: they receive provincial-level funds, they own significant 
        land holdings, and they possess expertise in ecosystem protection and 
        management, including flood controls and storm water management. As watershed-based 
        regional entities, conservation authorities are key players in the conservation 
        movement in Ontario.</p>

        United States. The Trust essentially uses the municipal consultation process 
        for amending a city's official plan to get the parties to share their 
        ideas about redeveloping a specific contaminated site.</p>

        than a strict focus on adherence to environmental protection laws, a more 
        straightforward question is posed: Given the particular land use, what 
        remediation is necessary to avoid demonstrable environmental and human 
        health effects? Ontario's cleanup philosophy is similar to many of the 
        new state Voluntary Cleanup Programs in the USA.</p>
      <p>17. As part of his presentation at the WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium, 
        Keith West from Ontario's Ministry of the Environment, did acknowledge 
        that overall the new guidelines were working &quot;by-n-large,&quot; but 
        that consistency among staff implementing the provincial MOU is still 
        a sticking point.</p>
      <p>18. The Trust, along with other key stakeholders, worked closely with 
        the Ministry to develop and review the guidelines for risk-based site-specific 
        cleanups. See the discussion of the Toronto Hydro project.</p>
      <p>19. One of the major private funders is the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
        Commerce. In 1996, the bank announced its partnership with the Waterfront 
        Regeneration Trust as part of its commitment to community development 
        and will provide $1 million over a five year period. http://www.waterfronttrail.org/

      <p>20. Cobourg has a population of 15,000 that is expected to increase by 
        20% in the next decade.</p>
      <p>21. According to Hoffman, with 99% of Cobourg's waterfront lands now 
        remediated, the redevelopment of these brownfields represents $200 million 
        dollars (Canadian) worth of construction projects and &quot;countless 
        dollars of renewed economic opportunities.&quot; Waterfront Regeneration 
        Trust's 1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>

      <p>23. Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail Newsletter, Waterfront Regeneration 
        Trust, Vol. 2, No. 1, p. 2. Cobourg's City Hall, built in the late 1800s, 
        is only 300 meters away from the harbor, but it does not face the waterfront; 
        thus, leaving the impression that even the city fathers who commissioned 
        the building turned their backs on the heavy industrial uses that occupied 
        Cobourg's waterfront.</p>
      <p>24. One cannot under score the important role that Hoffman played as 
        a catalyst in Cobourg's waterfront redevelopment. Many private developers 
        would not have persevered during the nearly ten years it took him from 
        his first phone call in 1989 to officially acquiring the Canadian National 
        Railways lands in 1997. &quot;I sincerely believe that my most effective 
        personal tool in expediting a resolution to the acquisition and remediation 
        of these lands was my constant badgering of the industrial landowners 
        over a period of years.&quot; WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>
      <p>25. Hoffman purchased and redeveloped a total of 9.2 acres, including 
        other sites adjacent and nearby the former McAsphalt Oil property. WRT's 
        1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>
      <p>26. Air sparging is an in situ remedial technology that reduces concentrations 
        of volatile constituents in groundwater through the injection of contaminant-free 
        air into the subsurface saturated zone.</p>
      <p>27. Quote from James Hoffman. He estimates that because of the Trust's 
        intervention his company saved two years in completing the clean-up and 
        development.</p>
      <p>28. WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>
      <p>29. During a panel discussion at WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium, Hoffman 
        claimed that steps one, two and three were the most difficult, time consuming 
        and expensive. The least difficult was the actual environmental cleanup 
        itself.</p>
      <p>30. Given that Hoffman intended to build condominiums, public education 
        was extremely important to avoid a potential marketing disaster for residential 
        development of these brownfields.</p>
      <p>31. The Oil companies used a variety of cleanup technologies and approaches, 
        including biopiles, air sparging, and dig and haul. Hoffman claims the 
        most effective and cost efficient method was a &quot;farming&quot; technique 
        his company refined over the past several years. At one site, Hoffman 
        remediated two acres of land with hydrocarbon contamination exceeding 
        16,000 parts per million and reduced it to 100 parts per million within 
        sixty days. WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>
      <p>32. Over the past four years (1994-1998), the Bank of Montreal has supported 
        Hoffman's development projects.</p>
      <p>33. Cobourg's regeneration efforts included contributions of over $200,000 
        by local private service organizations (i.e., Lions, Rotary, etc.), with 
        $400,000 of assistance from the WRT. Presentation by Wayne Deveau at the 
        WRT's 1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>
      <p>34. According to Wayne Deveau, Director of Community Development for 
        Cobourg, the marina and campground now accommodates about 4600 boats per 
        season compared with 1200 a few years ago. Presentation made at the WRT's 
        1998 Brownfields Symposium.</p>

        two levels of government, Imperial Oil, TEDCO, the area tenant, and the 
        Bank of Commerce. The Trust initially devised the frame of reference for 
        the stakeholders, blending the politics, communication, and technical 
        cleanup issues into one package.</p>

      <p>48. Ibid. This project was the first use of a site-specific risk assessment 
        in a redevelopment project on Toronto's waterfront. Such a flexible approach 
        allows the parties to manage their overall costs as long as the level 
        of cleanup remains consistent with the next land use and does not compromise 
        public health. Interesting enough, MOE did allow the use of a site-specific 
        risk-based cleanup plan at this site, even though it was still working 
        on its new provincial cleanup guidelines.</p>
