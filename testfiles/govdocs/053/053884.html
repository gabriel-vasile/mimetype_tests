<a  name ="sect2173.02" class = "section2"></a></p><h3 CLASS = "TITLE">2173.02   Clarity and Precision [R-3]</h3><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">The examiner's focus during examination of claims for compliance with the requirement for definiteness of  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 35&nbsp;U.S.C. 112</a>, second paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and precision, not whether more suitable language or modes of expression are available. When the examiner is satisfied that patentable subject matter is disclosed, and it is apparent to the examiner that the claims are directed to such patentable subject matter, he or she should allow claims which define the patentable subject matter with a <u>reasonable</u> degree of particularity and distinctness. Some latitude in the manner of expression and the aptness of terms should be permitted even though the claim language is not as precise as the examiner might desire. Examiners are encouraged to suggest claim language to applicants to improve the clarity or precision of the language
used, but should not reject claims or insist on their own preferences if other modes of expression selected by applicants satisfy the statutory requirement.</p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">The essential inquiry pertaining to this requirement is whether the claims set out and circumscribe a particular subject matter with a reasonable degree of clarity and particularity. Definiteness of claim language must be analyzed, not in a vacuum, but in light of:</p><p CLASS = "LIST"> </p><p CLASS = "LIST1">(A)   The content of the particular application disclosure; </p>
<p CLASS = "LIST1">(B)   The teachings of the prior art; and</p>
<p CLASS = "LIST1">(C)   The claim interpretation that would be given 	by one possessing the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent art at the time the invention was made. </p>
<p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">In reviewing a claim for compliance with 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, the examiner must consider the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves the notice function required by 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, by providing clear warning to others as to what constitutes infringement of the patent. See, e.g., <i>Solomon v. Kimberly-Clark Corp.</i>, 216 F.3d 1372, 1379, 55&nbsp;USPQ2d 1279, 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2000). See also <i>In re Larsen</i>, No. 01-1092 (Fed. Cir. May 9, 2001) (unpublished) (The preamble of the <i>Larsen</i> claim recited only a hanger and a loop but the body of the claim positively recited a linear member. The court observed that the totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction with each other must be considered
to ascertain the inventor's contribution to the art. Upon review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at issue apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves the notice function required by 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a> paragraph 2.). &gt;See also <i>Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings</i>, 370 F.3d 1354, 1366, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("The requirement to 'distinctly' claim means that the claim must have a meaning discernible to one of ordinary skill in the art when construed according to correct principles..Only when a claim remains insolubly ambiguous without a discernible meaning after all reasonable attempts at construction must a court declare it indefinite.").</p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">Accordingly, a claim term that is not used or defined in the specification is not indefinite if the meaning of the claim term is discernible. <i>Bancorp Services, L.L.C. v. Hartford Life Ins. Co.</i>, 359 F.3d 1367, 1372, 69 USPQ2d 1996, 1999-2000 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that the disputed claim term "surrender value protected investment credits" which was not defined or used in the specification was discernible and hence not indefinite because "the components of the term have well recognized meanings, which allow the reader to infer the meaning of the entire phrase with reasonable confidence").&lt;</p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">If the language of the claim is such that a person of ordinary skill in the art could not interpret the metes and bounds of the claim so as to understand how to avoid infringement, a rejection of the claim under 35&nbsp;U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, would be appropriate. See <i>Morton Int'l, Inc. v. Cardinal Chem. Co.</i>, 5&nbsp;F.3d 1464, 1470, 28 USPQ2d 1190, 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However, if the language used by applicant satisfies the statutory requirements of 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, but the examiner merely wants the applicant to improve the clarity or precision of the language used, the claim must <u>not</u> be rejected under 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, rather, the examiner should suggest improved language to the applicant. </p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">For example, a claim recites "a suitable liquid <u>such as</u> the filtrate of the contaminated liquid to be filtered and solids of a filtering agent <u>such as</u> perlite, cellulose powder, etc." The mere use of the phrase "such as" in the claim does not by itself render the claim indefinite. Office policy is not to employ <i>per se</i> rules to make technical rejections. Examples of claim language which have been held to be indefinite set forth in MPEP &sect;  <a class = "sectref" href = "2100_2173_05_d.htm#sect2173.05d"> 2173.05(d)</a> are fact specific and should <u> not</u> be applied as <i>per se</i> rules. The test for definiteness under 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, is whether "those skilled in the art would understand what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification." <i>Orthokinetics,
Inc. v. Safety Travel Chairs, Inc</i>., 806 F.2d 1565, 1576, 1 USPQ2d 1081, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1986). If one skilled in the art is able to ascertain in the example above, the meaning of the terms "suitable liquid" and "solids of a filtering agent" in light of the specification, 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, is satisfied. If upon review of the claim as a whole in light of the specification, the examiner determines that a rejection under 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, is not appropriate in the above-noted example, but is of the opinion that the clarity and the precision of the language can be improved by the deletion of the phrase "such as" in the claim, the examiner may make such a suggestion to the applicant. If applicant does not accept the examiner's suggestion, the examiner should not pursue the issue. </p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">If upon review of a claim in its entirety, the examiner concludes that a rejection under 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, is appropriate, such a rejection should be made and an analysis as to why the phrase(s) used in the claim is "vague and indefinite" should be included in the Office action. If applicants traverse the rejection, with or without the submission of an amendment, and the examiner considers applicant's arguments to be persuasive, the examiner should indicate in the next Office communication that the previous rejection under 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph, has been withdrawn and provide an explanation as to what prompted the change in the examiner's position (e.g., examiners may make specific reference to portions of applicant's remarks that were considered to be the basis as to why the previous rejection was withdrawn). </p><p CLASS = "PARA" CONTINUE="NO">By providing an explanation as to the action taken, the examiner will enhance the clarity of the prosecution history record. As noted by the Supreme Court in <i>Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co</i>., 535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 1838, 62 USPQ2d 1705, 1710 (2002), a clear and complete prosecution file record is important in that "[p]rosecution history estoppel requires that the claims of a patent be interpreted in light of the proceedings in the PTO during the application process." In <i>Festo</i>, the court held that "a narrowing amendment made to satisfy any requirement of the Patent Act may give rise to an estoppel." With respect to amendments made to comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, the court stated that "[i]f a &sect;  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a> amendment
is truly cosmetic, then it would not narrow the patent's scope or raise an estoppel. On the other hand, if a &sect;  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a> amendment is necessary and narrows the patent's scope-even if only for the purpose of better description-estoppel may apply." <i>Id</i>., at 1840, 62 USPQ2d at 1712. The court further stated that "when the court is unable to determine the purpose underlying a narrowing amendment-and hence a rationale for limiting the estoppel to the surrender of particular equivalents-the court should presume that the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader and the narrower language.the patentee should bear the burden of showing that the amendment does not surrender the particular equivalent in question." <i>Id</i>., at 1842, 62 USPQ2d at 1713. Thus, whenever possible, the examiner should
make the record clear by providing explicit reasoning for making or withdrawing any rejection related to 35 U.S.C.  <a class = "uscref" href = "appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112"> 112</a>, second paragraph.</p>
