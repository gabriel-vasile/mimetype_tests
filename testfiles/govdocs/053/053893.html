      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p class="content">We studied the role of technical clarity in successful multi-party negotiations. 
        Our investigations involved in-depth interviews with individuals who were 
        the principal participants in six consultations conducted under the Federal 
        Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) hydroelectric power project licensing 
        process. Technical clarity was especially important in the cases we studied 
        because they concerned questions that were science-based. The principal 
        issues in the six cases were fish passage, instream flow for fish habitat, 
        and entrainment of fish in hydropower turbines. We concluded that technical 
        clarity was one of the most critical elements in these conflicts. The 
        most successful negotiations were marked by a shared understanding of 
        technical issues among the parties.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3><a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p class="content">Technical clarity in negotiations over environmental issues involves 
        understanding the science-based aspects of a project, including the professional 
        value judgments that must be made and the technical facts. Technical clarity 
        is achieved when there is agreement on values and facts. Technical values 
        include issues such as the resources influenced by the project and the 
        geographic extent of project effects. Resolving these value questions 
        requires defining the nature and extent of benefits that may be gained 
        from the negotiation. Technical facts include issues such as the level 
        of flow that will provide fish habitat and the timing of flow releases 
        to maximize power production. Resolving the technical fact questions determines 
        distribution of these benefits to each party.</p>
      <p class="content">To determine the relation between technical clarity and successful negotiations, 
        we studied six consultations conducted under the Federal Energy Regulatory 
        Commission's (FERC) hydropower licensing process. These consultations 
        were undertaken between 1980 and 1989. Although the procedures for FERC 
        consultation became more formal after passage of the Electric Consumers 
        Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA; 16 U.S.C 791 et seq.), the negotiations 
        we studied were typical of most environmental conflicts in that the parties 
        were expected to work out acceptable means to protect fisheries and recreation 
        values without benefit of explicit rules to guide the process or evaluate 
        the solution they reached. The consultation procedures for all the cases 
        we studied required the applicant for a license to consult with state 
        and federal fish and wildlife agencies and to report the results of those 
        consultations to the FERC. The FERC issued licenses for the projects with 
        terms and conditions that usually reflected the results of the consultation 
        (Kerwin 1990). The principal issues in the six cases were fish passage, 
        instream flow releases for fish habitat, and entrainment of fish in hydropower 
        turbines.</p>
      <p class="content">These issues are very common in FERC hydropower licensing consultations 
        because hydroelectric projects almost always involve damming a stream, 
        bypassing the stream through a pipe (called a penstock), and dropping 
        the water back into the stream through a turbine that generates electrical 
        power. A hypothetical project is shown in Figure 1 to illustrate that 
        a hydropower facility could completely block the upstream migration of 
        fish unless suitable facilities for fish passage are included in the project. 
        Figure 1 also illustrates that the flow in a bypassed reach of stream 
        could be significantly reduced when water is routed through the penstock 
        to the powerhouse. In some projects, the turbines are incorporated into 
        the dam itself (resulting in no bypassed reach) and in others the bypassed 
        reach can extend for several miles. In addition, when water is directed 
        through the turbines, flow is increased below the powerhouse. This fluctuation 
        in flow can be dramatic, causing damage to the fishery and altering the 
        bed and banks of the stream. Finally, fish that pass through the penstock 
        and turbines can be injured or killed.</p>
      <p class="content">How to construct and operate a project so that these effects are minimized 
        is the question at the heart of most FERC hydroelectric license consultations. 
        For example, from 1980 through March of 1983, 59% of hydropower licenses 
        contained special articles governing instream flows (Kerwin 1990). Instream 
        flow conditions were included in 80% of the licenses issued during 1985 
        (Kerwin and Robinson 1985). Answering the question of how to minimize 
        environmental damage is a technical problem amenable to scientific analysis. 
        Although scientists can analyze the problem, the best course of action 
        is not beyond dispute. As Patterson observed about management of California's 
        Central Valley Project, &quot;This will not be just a technical decision. 
        Any program has to be workable politically&quot; (quoted in Burby 1994:44) 
        Ozawa and Susskind (1985) found that even if specific points are agreed 
        upon in environmental negotiations, it is common to disagree on how to 
        study the problem and how to interpret the results of studies. The findings 
        of our study support those of Ozawa and Susskind (1985). We concluded 
        that technical clarity was one critical element in the successful resolution 
        of these conflicts.</p>

      <h3><a name="methods"></a>METHODS</h3>
      <p class="content">We obtained records of 26 hydroelectric power licensing negotiations 
        from field offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). We asked 
        the field office supervisors to select cases they believed to have been 
        successfully resolved. Representatives from these offices were participants 
        in each negotiation and were required to maintain a record of the consultations. 
        Our objective was to follow a most similar system research design (Przeworski 
        and Teune 1970) by selecting the six most similar negotiations for which 
        documentation was available. The cases we chose included one new license 
        and five relicense consultations. The new license case was chosen because 
        of its strong similarity to other cases in terms of applicable licensing 
        regulations (Lamb 1992) and similar parties and issues. The five relicense 
        cases are approximately 25% of all FERC relicenses granted to utilities 
        during the period 1984-1989 (Richard Hunt Associates 1991). All the cases 
        involved at least the utility applicant, FWS, and state fish and game 
        agency; were conducted under the same regulatory regime (Kerwin 1990, 
        Bearzi and Wilkerson 1990, Bearzi 1991); and at least dealt with the environmental 
        issues of streamflow, fish passage, and fish entrainment. These environmental 
        concerns were the most common and time consuming issues faced by parties 
        to FERC licensing consultations during the period 1984-1989 (Richard Hunt 
        Associates 1991).</p>
      <p class="content">We tape-recorded structured interviews with 48 key individuals who participated 
        in the negotiations. Data were always collected from representatives of 
        the major parties in each dispute, including the FWS, state fish and game 
        agency, and applicant. Respondents were those assigned by their organizations 
        to actually conduct the negotiations. The interviews took place at the 
        respondent's place of business (two were conducted via telephone) and 
        ranged in duration from 1.5 to 3 hours. All but one of the 7-member study 
        team conducted interviews. Our interview questions were referenced directly 
        to criteria for finding technical clarity and success. We used two stages 
        of analysis to categorize responses according to these criteria: (1) evaluation 
        of transcribed responses by the 2-person interview team; and (2) review 
        of transcripts and interview team evaluations by the entire study team. 
        For each criterion we selected example statements that typified respondent 
        answers.</p>
      <p class="content">During the interviews, we asked respondents a series of questions to 
        determine how clearly technical issues were defined during the negotiation 
        process (Table 1). The answers varied from specific examples of how clearly 
        respondents understood the definition and scope of the issues and the 
        required research, to how clearly they understood the resulting data. 
        We also asked respondents to rate technical clarity on a scale from 1 
        to 10, with 1 meaning the issues were not at all clear and 10 meaning 
        the issues were perfectly clear. During the interviews we traced the history 
        of each case so that changes in technical clarity over the course of the 
        negotiation could be measured. Criteria for determining the clarity of 
        technical issues included: (1) All parties agreed to the definition of 
        the technical issues throughout the process but especially during the 
        stage when final agreement was being forged; and (2) the definition of 
        the technical issues was rated from high to very high (between 7 and 10) 
        by all respondents.</p>
      <p class="content">Interviewees were also asked to evaluate the success of each negotiation 
        (Table 2; Fulton 1992; Burkardt et. al 1995). Our criteria to evaluate 
        success included: the parties recognized that an agreement was reached, 
        the agreement included a plan of implementation and post- construction 
        monitoring, there was a willingness to enter into future negotiations 
        with the same parties, and respondents rated success at more than seven 
        on a ten-point scale (where 1 meant no success and 10 meant fully successful). 
        The cases we studied varied from fully successful to minimally successful 
        and in how well the technical clarity criteria were met.</p>

      <h3><a name="findings"></a>FINDINGS</h3>
      <h4>Eastman Falls Project</h4>
      <p class="content">Located on the Merrimack River in New Hampshire, this project is distinctive 
        in that it was one negotiation within the larger framework of the Merrimack 
        River Comprehensive Fish Passage Plan. The major issue was up- and downstream 
        fish passage. As part of negotiations on the Comprehensive Plan a requirement 
        for the project operator to install fish passage facilities had been discussed 
        and agreed upon before the application for a renewal license on the Eastman 
        Falls project was filed. As a result of these earlier discussions, there 
        was a great deal of clarity on technical issues before the license consultation 
        began. Through the Comprehensive Plan, the parties had developed a clear 
        understanding of the scope and scale of the issues, as well as the appropriate 
        methods to resolve those issues. Comments from two respondents illustrate 
        the clarity of technical issues:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="content"><em>Yeah, I think there was agreement on the technical issues, both 
            with respect to instream flow and fish passage. As I said, there was 
            agreement on the method to be used.</em></p>
          <p class="content"><em>Technical issues [were] very clear, just from the things that 
            I've cited in the application, that they agreed before they even met 
            with us...when I read this, I was pleased... Basically, my little 
            notes in the margin here were `concur, concur.'</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">The respondents' rating of a high level of technical clarity is illustrated 
        further by the numerical scores. The average score for technical clarity 
        in the consultation was 8.5. This does not mean there were no technical 
        controversies.</p>
      <p class="content">For example, controversy surrounded the technical responsibilities of 
        the parties, specifically in terms of jurisdiction. Members of the Technical 
        Committee for the Comprehensive Plan formulated recommendations which 
        they passed on to the Policy Committee. The Policy Committee, in turn, 
        constructed the Comprehensive Plan. In the Eastman Falls consultations 
        that followed, the negotiators were bound to adhere to the terms of the 
        Comprehensive Plan. However, some Eastman Falls negotiators believed that 
        they should have been part of the Technical Committee because they were 
        the appropriate parties to provide input on technical issues and boundaries. 
        In fact, the usual practice was for these negotiators to take the lead 
        in formulating technical recommendations, and the reversal in roles was 
        a stumbling block in completing the consultation.</p>
      <p class="content">We judged this negotiation to be successful. There was complete agreement 
        on resolution of the issues and a strong commitment to implement. All 
        parties were willing to negotiate again and respondents reported that 
        relationships improved. Success scores range from 7-10.</p>
      <h4>Koma Kulshan Project</h4>
      <p class="content">Like the Eastman Falls project, Koma Kulshan had a distinctive characteristic. 
        This characteristic was that the consultations' main issues-- streamflow 
        (i.e., How much water should remain in the bypassed reach?), sedimentation 
        (i.e., How much sediment would be washed into a downstream lake?), and 
        public access to the small reservoir created by the project--were fully 
        resolved. The respondents credited this to the fact that the physical 
        and biological impacts of the project were expected to be minimal. Once 
        the parties realized the straightforward nature of the environmental effects 
        little conflict ensued. Developing that realization was not easy. Agreeing 
        on a resolution required numerous meetings over several years in which 
        the participants learned to work together, developed a shared technical 
        understanding of project operations (including the difference between 
        pre- and post-project conditions), and constructed a solution. One respondent 
        summarized technical clarity well when he said:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="content"><em>[I]t [cumulative impact assessment] is a valid issue. What I 
            did have trouble with is that no one could really define what they 
            meant by `cumulative impact.' I'd say `O.K., what do you want us to 
            do?; What is it that you're really concerned about?' When we finally 
            did get things pinned down, it came down to sediment, that was the 
            major thing; that was something that was tractable.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">Located in a remote area on the Sandy and Sulphur Creeks in the State 
        of Washington, the project consisted of a water diversion structure and 
        a penstock transferring water to a power generating station. The technical 
        problems in this project proved amenable to resolution. For example, the 
        proposed site for the penstock was occupied by a plant on the State of 
        Washington's list of threatened species. Because an alternative site was 
        available the penstock could be built at a second location. Another problem 
        entailed the effects on trout of altered streamflow in the two streams. 
        Although the parties differed regarding the methods to investigate these 
        impacts, the problem was tractable because so few fish were found in the 
        streams. Finally, the major technical sticking point proved to be sediment 
        transport. As a result of the effective working relationship that had 
        developed over several years of negotiation, the parties were able to 
        develop a means to resolve this issue. Numerical ratings indicated that 
        by the time the consultation ended, all the respondents considered the 
        issues to be clear.</p>
      <p class="content">We found that the negotiations over Koma Kulshan were successful. All 
        parties believed that a successful agreement was reached. Eight of the 
        ten parties stated that the final agreement contained provisions for monitoring, 
        other parties did not recall. Each interviewee reported a willingness 
        to negotiate again. Success scores range from 5-10 with 8 of the 10 respondents 
        rating success at 7 or higher.</p>
      <h4>Oswegatchie Project</h4>
      <p class="content">The Oswegatchie River Project in New York encompasses six dams located 
        on a seventy mile stretch of river. The project consists of a series of 
        power stations and penstocks that bypass the natural river channel. The 
        principal issue in this negotiation was streamflow in the bypassed reaches. 
        An understanding of the scope and effect of this issue was shared by the 
        parties and was believed to be the only important technical issue. The 
        parties were able to reach agreement on all but one of the bypassed reaches. 
        On this one reach they submitted differing recommendations to the FERC, 
        and FERC made the final decision. One respondent recalled:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="content"><em>I think [the technical issue] was pretty well defined. The issue 
            was flows in selected riverine reaches. And there's no question, we 
            all knew what the issue was; I think it stayed focused. It didn't 
            waiver, which was unique. But, of course, this was intended to be 
            sort of a one issue consultation.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">Although the question of appropriate flows in the contested bypass reach 
        was clear in the sense that everyone knew that flows in that reach were 
        a stumbling block to agreement, the parties struggled over the conduct 
        and interpretation of studies to assess the effects of altered flows. 
        The struggles among the parties reflected strongly held differences in 
        goals for operation of the project; some parties sought to maximize generation 
        efficiencies while others attempted to maximize instream benefits. Conflicts 
        that manifested as technical differences were actually a reluctance to 
        compromise closely held values. The question of flows in the last stream 
        reach remained intractable because there were no identifiable physical 
        alternatives. Moreover, each party believed it would prevail when the 
        issue was elevated to the FERC. In an effort to bolster its position late 
        in the consultation, the state sought another mechanism to impose its 
        instream flow requirement on the other parties. One mechanism available 
        to the state was section 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act. Under that 
        section, the state is required to issue a water quality certificate indicating 
        whether the project as planned would violate state water quality standards. 
        If a state finds that water quality standards would be violated, it may 
        include provisions in the certificate to protect water quality. The FERC 
        must follow the requirements in a state's section 401 certificate. In 
        this case, the state included an instream flow requirement in its certification 
        and the utility protested that action. Numerical scores for technical 
        clarity were high with a mean overall score of 8. This high score reflects 
        the parties' understanding of the nature of the impasse.</p>
      <p class="content">We judged the negotiation to be minimally successful. Agreement was not 
        reached on all points: The state section 401 water quality certification 
        and instream flows were unresolved and the FERC order was contested. Implementation 
        was not a major issue in the negotiation but monitoring was included in 
        FERC order.</p>
      <p class="content">All parties reported a willingness to negotiate again. Success scores 
        range from 7-8.</p>
      <h4>Cataract Project</h4>
      <p class="content">Ratings for technical clarity in the Cataract Project changed dramatically 
        at different times during the negotiation. Cataract is the downstream-most 
        impoundment on the Saco River in Southern Maine. Water released from the 
        project travels a short distance before emptying into the estuary of the 
        Saco. In the early stages of the consultation, the parties shared an understanding 
        that the issues included instream flow for Cataract and seven upstream 
        impoundments, the need for a comprehensive river plan, and fish passage. 
        Understanding these issues did not preclude disagreement. For example, 
        the exact details of a comprehensive river plan were contentious because 
        the parties could not resolve the question of how far upstream fish passage 
        facilities needed to be constructed.</p>
      <p class="content">After the project proponent completed the license application, additional 
        conflicts arose while some existing issues became clearer. For example, 
        the fish passage issue became clearer through a mutual agreement setting 
        an approach to resolving the problem. In this phase, one party introduced 
        the issue of flow releases for waste assimilation downstream of the dam 
        in the form of a state Section 401 water quality certification. This new 
        issue surprised other parties because it was introduced late in the consultation 
        process. Uncertainty about state Section 401 certification was manifested 
        in discussions about whether the state agencies had the authority to include 
        streamflow as a part of their Section 401 certification and whether FERC 
        was bound to include the Section 401 certificate in the license. Because 
        the answers to these questions were unclear the parties responded with 
        low ratings in our quantitative measure of technical clarity. In the final 
        phase--after a license was issued-- technical clarity was reported as 
        high even though the Section 401 flow issue remained unresolved.</p>
      <p class="content">As time passed in the Cataract negotiations, some issues were clarified, 
        some muddied, and some discarded. Most disagreements about technical issues 
        revolved around how to make decisions, resolve problems, choose methodologies, 
        and interpret results. The parties understood the issues but could not 
        agree on how to resolve them. One reason for this was that the applicant 
        and some of the parties to the Cataract consultation were simultaneously 
        involved in a very contentious general stream negotiation on the Kennebec 
        River and that process led to skepticism about the Cataract process. The 
        following exchange characterizes the respondents' conclusions about this 
        negotiation:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <ul>
          <li><em>Q: Once established, during that first phase, was the understanding 
            of what the technical issues were, ever lost?</em></li>
          <li><em>A: I think what the consultation does, and certainly what it 
            did in Cataract, is, it better defines [issues]. As we went through 
            this process, we better defined maintenance drawdown as a potential 
            habitat concern. Better defined certain fish passage issues. So I 
            don't think anything was lost, just better defined, which is the goal 
            of that process.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">We rated the Cataract project as minimally successful. Not all parties 
        believed that a satisfactory agreement was reached. The state Section 
        401 water quality certification, fish passage, and instream flow were 
        unresolved issues. Procedures to implement agreements were included for 
        those issues on which there was agreement. All parties reported a willingness 
        to negotiate again. Success scores range from 2-9.</p>
      <h4>Ashton-St. Anthony Project</h4>
      <p class="content">Located on the Henry's Fork River in southeastern Idaho, the Ashton-St. 
        Anthony Project consists of two developments; a dam, reservoir, and powerhouse 
        near the town of Ashton and a diversion dam, canal, and powerhouse within 
        the city limits of St. Anthony. The project was constructed in the mid- 
        1910's, later acquired by a large regional utility, and scheduled for 
        relicense in 1984. Under FERC rules of that period the relicensing presented 
        an opportunity for a municipality to obtain the new license, to the detriment 
        of the utility.</p>
      <p class="content">Because of this competition, the utility sought to streamline the relicensing 
        process by simplifying many technical issues. As the consultation progressed 
        it became obvious that the utility's application would prevail over any 
        competitor and the negotiations over technical issues became more intense. 
        In the early stages, studies were agreed to without discussion on the 
        eventual interpretation of the resulting data; in some cases there seems 
        to have been no mutual understanding of the purpose of the studies.</p>
      <p class="content">The license was issued on the condition that further studies would be 
        undertaken. During this second phase there was a lack of agreement on 
        the use of scientific techniques. Although the parties agreed that fish 
        entrainment and turbine mortality of native fishes was an issue and they 
        agreed to conduct studies of those phenomena, they failed to agree on 
        how to quantify losses of native fish due to those causes and they did 
        not discuss how data were to be interpreted. It was during this second 
        phase, too, that the parties realized some of their earlier assumptions 
        about other technical matters had not been accurate. For example, one 
        party was asked to study the reservoir fishery. After the study was completed 
        there was disagreement on study scope, results, and reporting procedures. 
        One respondent reported skepticism about negotiations over technical issues:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="content"><em>That's why I say that technically it appeared that a lot of these 
            issues were not based on any type of real studies or a management 
            objective. They appeared more like a biologist or some manager's hunch 
            that, I think this is what happened, and at this point in time, we 
            really need more wetlands, or that our focus is on improving deer 
            winter range, so we need more of this or more of that, and so that's 
            what we ought to call for as far as mitigation, when it comes to hydro 
            projects.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">Another important factor in this consultation was that the statute guiding 
        the FERC's licensing activities was amended by ECPA in the middle stages 
        of this negotiation, causing all parties to be unsure of the process.</p>
      <p class="content">The negotiations were judged to be minimally successful. Only parts of 
        an agreement were finalized. Fish passage, entrainment, and wetlands protection 
        were unresolved issues. Agreements that were reached did include some 
        implementation and monitoring. All parties reported a willingness to negotiate 
        again. Success scores range from 3-10.</p>
      <h4>Pit 3,4,5</h4>
      <p class="content">The Pit River of northern California empties into Shasta reservoir on 
        the Sacramento River and is marked by a series of hydroelectric projects. 
        Each project consists of a dam with a downstream reach bypassed by a penstock. 
        Pit 3, 4, 5 is a series of three diversion structures, bypass reaches, 
        and power stations. The project directly affects more than 62 kilometers 
        of river.</p>
      <p class="content">Respondents in the pre-license phase reported three phenomena: confusion 
        on what they were trying to accomplish with the consultation, agreement 
        on some issues to study, and disagreement on where studies would lead 
        the parties. One exchange with a respondent illustrates the confusion:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <ul>
          <li><em>Q. But during this time ... was there a lack of clarity among 
            the parties with regard to the issues themselves, what the issues 
            were?</em></li>
          <li><em>A. You bet. And I think a lot of it was confusing because you 
            had archaeological concerns. You had that whole can of worms, ... 
            going on at the same time, and Exhibit R tying to Exhibit S. A lot 
            of people didn't understand where we were in the process, and sometimes 
            ... there was confusion. ...<br>
            </em></li>
          <li><em>Q. Was there a time ... up until the issuance of the license, 
            where the parties did come together and agree, then, what were the 
            issues?</em></li>
          <li><em>A. No, I don't think anybody ever said `These are the 20 issues 
            we've got.'... You had this meeting for this reason, this meeting 
            for that reason ...and nobody was ever sitting down and tying them 
            all together.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">This confusion was due to uncertainty over how to handle the resolution 
        of technical questions and how to move forward. The parties looked to 
        the FERC for leadership but found little, and the direction provided by 
        the applicant did not seem to lead to timely results. Confusion did not 
        arise from disputes over which studies to conduct. Rather, after completing 
        the studies the parties still did not agree on how to interpret the results.</p>
      <p class="content">The post-license phase was marked by studies designed to meet license 
        requirements and agreements on several outstanding issues. But the issue 
        of flow release in the Pit 3 bypass reach had not been resolved. After 
        the flow studies were completed the parties could not agree whether the 
        flows were established to promote trout habitat or eagle foraging on Sacramento 
        Sucker. Even within the internal deliberations of one of the parties there 
        was no agreement about this question. Moreover, although the parties did 
        agree that eagle foraging was one important factor, they could not agree 
        how much use by eagles constituted foraging: Did one eagle taking one 
        fish constitute foraging or did foraging require a group of eagles making 
        regular use of the reach?</p>
      <p class="content">We rated the negotiation as minimally successful. Agreement was not reached 
        on flows and the FERC order was contested. Implementation was included 
        on those issues agreed to; monitoring was a part of FERC license. All 
        parties reported a willingness to negotiate again. Success scores range 
        from 1-7.</p>
      <h6 align="right"><a href="#top">TOP OF PAGE</a></h6>
      <h3><a name="discussion"></a>DISCUSSION</h3>
      <p class="content">Of the six projects, we evaluated two as fully successful (Eastman Falls 
        and Koma Kulshan), and four as minimally successful (Oswegatchie, Cataract, 
        Ashton-St. Anthony, and Pit 3, 4, 5). The two successful cases were the 
        ones in which technical clarity was most evident (Table 3). Although two 
        consultations were judged to be successful each displayed unique distinguishing 
        features. In Eastman Falls the key feature was the earlier negotiation 
        of a comprehensive plan covering fish passage requirements for the entire 
        river. Mitigation steps required of the Eastman Falls project proponent 
        were understood in advance and the consultation was a matter of conforming 
        to the plan. Questions did arise about the responsibilities of individuals 
        representing some of the parties to the consultation because those representatives 
        had not been a part of the negotiations over the comprehensive plan. However, 
        these questions did not impinge upon the technical clarity of the issues 
        under negotiation.</p>
      <p class="content">In Koma Kulshan the issues were streamflow, sedimentation, and public 
        access. Unlike Eastman Falls, there was no previous agreement on these 
        issues. The parties had to decide what the problems were, determine appropriate 
        studies to evaluate alternatives, and design a solution. All of this required 
        considerable time. This was the one case we studied for which no license 
        had yet been issued. Because the project was not in place the parties 
        had the luxury of time to develop a solution. Although the parties were 
        interested in completing the consultation, several non-technical issues 
        delayed the process. The delay allowed time to develop trust-based working 
        relationships. Finally, the parties agreed that the environmental effects 
        of the project would be minor.</p>
      <p class="content">The feature that sets these negotiations apart from those that were less 
        successful is that the parties shared an understanding of the technical 
        issues. In both cases this shared understanding arose from a long negotiation; 
        albeit in the Eastman Falls instance that negotiation occurred in a separate 
        forum. In each case the technical issues were straightforward and there 
        was no real question about whether or not the project should be licensed 
        (although this was not clear at the beginning of the Koma Kulshan consultation).</p>
      <p class="content">The parties in both consultations were able to resolve (Koma Kulshan) 
        or already had resolved (Eastman Falls) the technical questions related 
        to the heart of the negotiation: What is the extent of adverse environmental 
        effects? That is to say, they resolved the value or ethical questions 
        about the project. Simon (1976) observed that every decision contains 
        both fact and value elements. Factual propositions are those things that 
        can be objectively tested, while values are statements of what ought to 
        be. Values are ethical propositions that &quot;cannot be described as 
        correct or incorrect&quot; (Simon 1976:50). One of the most difficult 
        tasks in the consultations we studied was for the parties to arrive at 
        some ethical premise that would guide their negotiations. In the successful 
        negotiations the parties were either given or developed the premise that 
        it was suitable that the license be granted. Reaching this conclusion 
        was made easier by the fact that the technical issues were straightforward 
        and the environmental effects seemed minor.</p>
      <p class="content">The unsuccessful negotiations in our study can be characterized as follows: 
        In two, the technical issues--and to some extent the consultation process--were 
        clear but value considerations intervened. In the other two, the technical 
        issues were never clear, the process was fuzzy, and value considerations 
        were not resolved. Of the minimally successful consultations Oswegatchie 
        and Cataract provide examples of clear technical facts but conflicts over 
        goals. In Oswegatchie flows in one bypass reach were the key to the conflict. 
        The parties differed on the effects of these flows, with the utility believing 
        that releasing the flows significantly reduced the profitability of the 
        project while the agencies believed that their recommended flows in the 
        bypassed reach were essential for fisheries and recreation. Moreover, 
        each party believed that the FERC process favored their position and that 
        if the decision were left to the FERC, their own positions would be upheld.</p>

      <p class="content">In Cataract the issues were a comprehensive plan for fish passage on 
        the entire river, fish passage at the Cataract site, and bypass flows. 
        Resolution of this dispute hinged on developing a common objective for 
        all projects on the river. Because it was the most downstream project 
        some parties wanted to use the Cataract licensing process to leverage 
        an agreement that fish passage facilities would be built on all upstream 
        dams. On the other hand, the utility wanted to decide the fish passage 
        question on a project-by-project basis, arguing that when fish migrated 
        up to the next dam, passage facilities could be designed for that project. 
        The parties in Cataract and Oswegatchie understood the facts but disagreed 
        on the values.</p>
      <p class="content">Ashton-St. Anthony and Pit 3, 4, 5 provide examples of unclear technical 
        issues, opposing values, and an unclear consultation process. In Ashton-St. 
        Anthony none of the parties was able to articulate clear management objectives--other 
        than the utility's aim to relicense the project. All the parties expressed 
        confusion about how to conduct the consultation. Studies were conducted 
        without agreement on purpose or method. Steps were taken to conduct studies, 
        acquire lands, or perform other mitigation activities without a clear 
        connection to goals beyond meeting milestones in an uncertain process. 
        In Pit 3, 4, 5 instream flow studies were undertaken because it was understood 
        that such studies had been required in other cases. But there was no agreement 
        on the management objective of the studies- -i.e., eagle forage or trout 
        fishery. The parties believed the FERC licensing process was fuzzy. Although 
        the rules governing the FERC process changed during the course of all 
        our cases, Ashton-St. Anthony and Pit 3, 4, 5 negotiations were not near 
        conclusion at the time of the change and respondents cited the changed 
        rules as factors in resolving the conflicts.</p>
      <p class="content">Several factors promote technical clarity during negotiations. For example, 
        we found that having a sense of urgency in the negotiation motivated participants 
        to work hard at defining the appropriate technical issues. Conversely, 
        a consultation process that is at once formally required and uncertain 
        in its procedural requirements reduces the sense of urgency. The combination 
        of the right people in the right places was also extremely important. 
        Knowledgeable individuals with well planned objectives and experience 
        in group decision-making are valuable to all sides.</p>
      <p class="content">The most successful negotiations we studied focused on two technical 
        elements: First, coming to agreement on desirable conditions (values) 
        and, second, determining how to operate a project to achieve those conditions 
        (facts). In the least successful negotiations, parties attempted to answer 
        the project operation question without resolving their differences over 
        goals. Thus, disagreement over technical issues was a manifestation of 
        underlying differences in approach and philosophy. Achieving technical 
        clarity is difficult. Negotiators often plunged into their task without 
        clearly defining the problem, hoping that a series of studies would illuminate 
        the best course of action (Burkardt et al. 1995). Defining and discussing 
        technical issues and their implications at an early stage may be critical 
        to the ultimate success of a negotiation.</p>
