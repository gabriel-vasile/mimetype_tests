<h2><a href="video.shtml">Moving Images</a> &gt;&gt; Video Streams as Sources for Files</h2>

</div>



<p>

The clarity of a digital moving image file is strongly influenced by the clarity of the source used to produce the file, when the content is derived from a video signal sent via an appropriate interface from a camera or a pre-existing video recording on tape or disk.  If the original source for the content is motion picture film, and the context is an end-user application (in contrast to a specialized professional application), current-day production technology generally requires that the film be transferred to video prior to digital file making.</p>
      <p> There are exceptions to the preceding, mentioned but not explored on 
        this page. First, in some professional settings, film may be scanned on 
        a frame by frame basis to produce a digital representation in a format 
        like <a href="../fdd/fdd000052.shtml">DPX_2</A>, OpenEXR, or <a href="../fdd/fdd000013.shtml">MXF</a>, 
        which may in turn encode the frames using JPEG 2000 or some other still-frame 
        compression algorithm. Such an approach is part of the digital cinema 
        <a href="../fdd/fdd000177.shtml">DCDM</a> specification. The image content 
        in these formats may then be output to end-user digital video files in 
        a manner different from that described below. Second, certain kinds of 
        Computer Aided Design or Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) renderings 
        include motion capabilities and CAD-CAM software often permits creators 
        to "save as" video. This capability is especially likely to be employed 
        for three-dimensional drawings that may be rotated to simulate viewing 
        from various points of view. Third (and this is very like the preceding 
        exception), animated content created in a computer authoring format like 
        <a href="../fdd/fdd000132.shtml">FLA</a> (Macromedia Flash Project File 
        Format) can be saved as <a href="../fdd/fdd000130.shtml">SWF</a> (Macromedia 
        Flash SWF File Format) files and played in Macromedia's proprietary software, 
        or saved in other digital video formats like <a href="../fdd/fdd000052.shtml">QuickTime</a> 
        or the <a href="../fdd/fdd000155.shtml">MPEG-4</a> file format. Quality 
        for these types of content will have different dependencies than that 
        of typical camera-generated video. </p>

 <p>

Table 1 lists a few examples of source video.  Generally speaking, "all other things being equal," larger picture sizes offer greater clarity.  Video-stream picture sizes are often expressed as horizontal lines and samples per line.  These measures are comparable to pixels, but the values will change if the digital-file production process (a) rescales the image, e.g., to quarter-screen size,<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> (b) if some lines are dropped, e.g., 483 becomes 480, in order to have a value divisible by 16, helpful in computation, or (c) if the rendering produces square pixels, in which case 720x480 becomes 640x480.

The selected Table 1 examples are from United States standards, i.e., the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) analog broadcast standard or the new Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) digital standard.  Thus they have a nominal frame rate of 30 fps (frames per second).  In the course of producing video files, analog signals like the ones in the top two rows are converted to digital component signals; if compressed bitstreams are being produced, this step precedes compression encoding.

</p>

      <p> It is worth noting that the ATSC digital standard permits other frame 
        rates, e.g., 24 fps for video content derived from American motion picture 
        films. In coming years, the Library of Congress is almost certain to receive 
        24 fps material, and may receive video at other frame rates as well, e.g., 
        25 fps non-NTSC, ATSC, and non-ATSC content from European and other nations. 
      </p>

      <p> Beyond picture size, the clarity of a source signal is influenced by 
        other factors, e.g., the type of sampling (e.g., 4:4:4, 4:2:2, or 4:2:0, 
        etc., representing the relative representation of luminance [first number] 
        and chrominance information [second and third numbers]) and the bit depth 
        per sampled channel (e.g., 10 or 8). Older material reformatted from composite 
        video (the first row in Table 1) was often produced using an older generation 
        of camera, and image artifacts may result from the processes used to transcode 
        from composite to component. Source video streams may also be derived 
        from compressed recordings and the type and degree of previously applied 
        compression will also affect clarity. </p>

      <p>Clarity is also adversely affected by interlacing and enhanced by progressive 
        image display. An interlaced image consists of two video fields, captured 
        a few milliseconds apart. When the subject of scene is moving, the time 
        difference between the two fields means that interlaced images will contain 
        a small amount of blur within a single video frame. The particular methods 
        used to transfer film to video will also influence clarity. New footage 
        will have improved clarity if progressive rather than interlaced frames 
        are produced by new camera models or new datacine or film-scanning devices. 
      </p>

      <p>Although experts agree that, at the same picture size, the clarity of 
        a progressive image surpasses that of an interlaced image, they are divided 
        when asked to choose between progressive scan and more scan lines (greater 
        picture size). Supporters of 1080i video argue that greater clarity results 
        from having more pixels, even if interlaced, while supporters of 720p 
        argue that progressive scan produces superior results.</p>

<p>Variation in source content for compression is partly represented in the MPEG-2 and -4 standards (and possibly others) via what are called <em>levels</em>.  Table 2 illustrates the relation between MPEG-2 levels and quality in terms of the standard's conformance points.  The standard permits the placement of signals at intermediate points, e.g., picture sizes like 1280x720, and at data rates below the maxima listed here.</p>
