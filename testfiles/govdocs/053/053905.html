</div>
  <p><span class="startletter">W</span>hen buying a house near the shore, do people pay more for  environmental amenities such as water clarity and quality? Residents living  around Lake Erie do, according to researchers in Ohio.</p>
  <p> The study on the value people place on water clarity and quality  is part of the broader research question being pursued by Ohio State University faculty of "How do people  interact with the lake?"</p>
<p> "In almost any management 
  area, understanding human 
  behavior and how humans respond to the lake or ecosystem being managed is as  important as understanding the ecosystem itself," says Elena Irwin, associate  professor in the Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics  Department at Ohio State University.</p>
<p> Irwin and fellow university researcher Tim Haab hope the answers  to their broad research question will help coastal 
  resource managers better 
  balance environmental economics with ecology.</p>
<h3>Building  Boom</h3>
<p>  There are many different ways that people interact with the  coastal environment, Irwin says.</p>
<p> One of the ways, she says, is that Lake Erie and the rest of the  nation's coastline "provide amenities to people, and people value amenities.  That can affect people's behavior in a variety of ways. It influences recreational  choices, which can lead to economic development, an increase in commercial  services, and can impact housing values."</p>
<p> Like coastal property around most of the country, Irwin points  out that the development of and prices paid for homes on Lake Erie's shoreline have "grown  tremendously" in recent years. </p>
<p> "We've seen an increase not just in second homes, but an  increase in permanent residences and lake recreation, as well." She notes a  small island off the shoreline of Ottawa County that has gone from being  "mainly the location of a Civil War graveyard and modest second homes to  year-round or second homes for very wealthy people, selling for $1 to $1.5  million."</p>
<p> The conundrum for coastal managers is balancing people's  attraction to the amenities of the coast and the resulting economic growth with  the ecosystem impacts that result from that influx of people and development. </p>
<p> "Our question," Irwin says, "was if people value the lake's  amenities such as water clarity and water quality strongly enough, will it show  up in terms of the capital value of homes around the lake?"</p>
<h3>Finding  the Answer</h3>
<p>  With funding from Ohio Sea Grant and the help of graduate  student Shihomi Ara, Irwin and Haab worked for two years to answer that  question.</p>
<p> Most of the data they used in the study was  secondary data, Irwin says. Information on housing values—and the homes  themselves—was collected from each coastal county's tax assessor office. They  were able to plug in the housing costs and corresponding information, such as  number of bedrooms and bathrooms, size of the house and lot, and location, into  a geographic information system (GIS). </p>
<p> They were then able to use the GIS to find out general  information, such as how far the homes were from lake access points, major  centers of employment, and any polluting activities, and even the home's school  district.</p>
<p> Data on water clarity from secchi disk depth readings and on  water quality, including fecal coliform bacteria data, were  also  plugged into the GIS. </p>
<p> A statistical model was used to compare  bacteria and water clarity averages for the beach nearest each house with the  sales price and information about the homes. This enabled the researchers to  determine how changes in water clarity or quality impacted property values. </p>
<h3>Capital  Returns</h3>
<p>  The researchers found that both water clarity and quality  correlated with increased property values, but "water clarity seems to have the  biggest bang for the buck in terms of housing price," Irwin says.</p>
<p> "If you increased the depth of water  clarity by two meters, it was found to increase the average housing value by  $4,300," she explains. This is an increase of between four and five percent of  the average home value in the study region. </p>
<p> "Looking at water quality in terms of bacterial counts, when  there were no beach closings, had a slightly positive effect" of increasing the  price of an average home by 0.1 percent, or a little more than $100.</p>
<p> The finding also showed that proximity to the beach and beach  access points also increased the value of a home.</p>
<h3>Quantitative  Evidence</h3>
<p>What the study didn't pick up, she says, is the amenity value of  having waterfront property. Their study also only looked at home value and did  not take into account visitors' use of the lake. The researchers plan to  continue their study and hope to tease out additional information on the  relationship between Lake Erie's environment and  economy.</p>
<p> "We measured one aspect of that," Irwin says, "but there are  many other ways that improvement or decline of lake functioning impacts the economy.</p>
<p> "Our numbers are upper-end estimates of what the home value  could be, because they assume no market changes, but this does provide  quantitative evidence that people value the lake's amenities and that there is  an economic impact from having a healthy lake."  </p>
<p> This information can give policy makers some idea of the  magnitude of the impact a functioning coastal ecosystem can have on the  economy. </p>
"The take-home  message," Irwin says, "is that improved water clarity is a benefit. Lake managers should have the  lake water quality in mind as they prioritize and make decisions and goals  related to a healthy ecosystem."
