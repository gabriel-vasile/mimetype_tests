subchapter A, parts 1 through 11, of title 39 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations. These amendments implement changes in the authority, 
responsibilities, and procedures of the Board made necessary by the 
Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Public Law 
109-435. The Postal Service hereby publishes this final rule revising 
subchapter A to reflect the changes in the Board's Bylaws.

DATES: Effective Date: December 24, 2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document revises subchapter A,

to the Bylaws of the Postal Service's Board of Governors necessitated

editorial or technical in nature, and do not alter the authority, 
responsibilities, or procedures of the Board. Others reflect 
substantive changes in these matters, particularly with reference to

    The U.S. Postal Service is established under the provisions of the 
Postal Reorganization Act (the Reorganization Act) of 1970, Public Law 
91-375, 84 Stat. 719, as amended by the Postal Accountability and 
Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Public Law 109-435, 120 Stat. 3198, as 
an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government 
of the United States, under the direction of a Board of Governors, with 
the Postmaster General as its chief executive officer. The Board of 
Governors of the Postal Service (the

[[Page 78984]]

Board) directs the exercise of its powers through management that is 
expected to be honest, efficient, economical, and mindful of the 
competitive business environment in which the Postal Service operates. 
The Board consists of nine Governors appointed by the President, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to represent the public 
interest generally, together with the Postmaster General and Deputy 
Postmaster General.


Sec.  1.2  Delegation of authority.

    Except for powers, duties, or obligations specifically vested in 
the Governors by law, the Board may delegate its authority to the 
Postmaster General under such terms, conditions, and limitations, 
including the power of redelegation, as it finds desirable. The bylaws 
of the Board are the framework of the system through which the Board 
monitors the exercise of the authority it has delegated, measures 
progress toward the goals it has set, and shapes the policies to guide 
the future development of the Postal Service. Delegations of authority 
do not relieve the Board of full responsibility for carrying out its 
duties and functions, and are revocable by the Governors in their 
exclusive judgment.

compliance with the provisions of these bylaws concerning public 
observation of meetings. Attendance at a meeting by this method

subdivision or committee of the Board authorized to take action on 
behalf of the Board.
    (b) The term meeting means the deliberations of at least the number 
of individual members required to take action on behalf of the Board 
under Sec.  5.2 or Sec.  6.6 of these bylaws, where such deliberations 
determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of the official 
business of the Board. The term ``meeting'' does not include any 
procedural deliberations required or permitted by Sec. Sec.  6.1, 6.2, 
7.4, or 7.5 of these bylaws.


Sec.  7.2  Open meetings.

    (a) It is the policy of the United States, established in section 2 
of the

[[Page 78989]]

Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, that 
the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding 
the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government. The Postal 
Service is charged to provide the public with this information while 
protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Government 
to carry out its responsibilities. Accordingly, except as specifically 
permitted by statute, every portion of every meeting of the Board of 
Governors is open to public observation.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec.  7.3 of these bylaws, every portion 
of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation. Members of 
the Board may not jointly conduct or dispose of business of the Board 
without complying with Sec. Sec.  7.2 through 7.8 of these bylaws. 
Members of the public may obtain access to documents considered at 
meetings to the extent provided in the regulations of the Postal 
Service concerning the release of information.
    (c) Without the permission of a majority of the Board, no person 
may participate in, film, televise, or broadcast any portion of any 
meeting of the Board. Any person may electronically record or 
photograph a meeting, as long as that action does not tend to impede or 
disturb the members of the Board in the performance of their duties, or 
members of the public while attempting to attend or observe a meeting 
of the Board. The rules and penalties of 39 CFR Part 232, concerning 
conduct on postal property, apply with regard to meetings of the Board.


Sec.  7.3  Exceptions.

    Section 7.2 of these bylaws does not apply to a portion of a 
meeting, and Sec. Sec.  7.4 and 7.5 do not apply to information 
concerning the meeting which otherwise would be required to be 
disclosed to the public, if the Board properly determines that the 
public interest does not require otherwise, and that such portion of 
the meeting or the disclosure of such information is likely to:
    (a) Disclose matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense 
or foreign policy, and
    (2) In fact properly classified under that Executive order;
    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Postal Service, including the Postal Service position in 
negotiations or consultations with employee organizations.
    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552), 
provided that the statute:
    (1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (2) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, such as market 
information pertinent to Postal Service borrowing or investments, 
technical or patent information related to postal mechanization, or 
commercial information related to purchases of real estate;
    (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (f) Disclose information of a personal nature, such as personal or 
medical data regarding any individual if disclosure would constitute a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in those 
records, but only to the extent that the production of those records or 
information would:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source,
    (5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely significantly to frustrate implementation of a proposed action 
of the Board, such as information relating to the negotiation of a 
labor contract or proposed Postal Service procurement activity, except 
that this provision does not apply in any instance where:
    (1) The Postal Service has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of the proposed action, or
    (2) The Postal Service is required by law to make such disclosure 
on its own initiative before taking final action on the proposal; or
    (j) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena by the Postal 
Service, or the participation of the Postal Service in a civil action 
or proceeding, such as a postal rate or classification proceeding, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Postal Service of a 
particular case of formal adjudication under the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 
554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after 
opportunity for a hearing.


Sec.  7.4  Procedure for closing a meeting.

    (a) A majority of the entire membership of the Board may vote to 
close a portion of a meeting or to withhold information concerning a 
meeting under the provisions of Sec.  7.3 of these bylaws. The members 
shall take a separate vote with respect to each meeting a portion of 
which is proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any 
information which is proposed to be withheld, and shall make every 
reasonable effort to take any such vote at least 8 days before the date 
of the meeting involved. The members may take a single vote with 
respect to a series of meetings, portions of which are proposed to be 
closed to the public, or with respect to information concerning the 
series, so long as each portion of a meeting in the series involves the 
same particular matters, and no portion of any meeting is scheduled to 
be held more than 30 days after the initial portion of the first 
meeting in the series.
    (b) Whenever any person whose interest may be directly affected by 
a portion of a meeting requests that the Board close that portion to 
the public for any of the reasons referred to in Sec.  7.3(e), (f), or 
(g) of these bylaws, upon request of any one of its members the Board 
shall vote by recorded vote whether to close that portion of the 
meeting.
    (c) The Secretary shall record the vote of each member 
participating in a vote under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

PART 8--[RESERVED]

PART 9--[RESERVED]

PART 10--RULES OF CONDUCT FOR POSTAL SERVICE GOVERNORS (ARTICLE X)

Sec.
10.1 Applicability.
10.2 Advisory service.
10.3 Post-employment activities.
10.4 Financial disclosure reports.

    Authority: 39 U.S.C. 401(2), (10).


Sec.  10.1  Applicability.

    This part contains rules of conduct for the members of the Board of 
Governors of the United States Postal Service. As special employees 
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 202(a), the members of the Board are 
also subject to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch, 5 CFR part 2635, and Postal Service regulations 
supplemental thereto, 5 CFR part 7001.


Sec.  10.2  Advisory service.

    (a) The General Counsel is the Ethical Conduct Officer of the 
Postal Service and the Designated Agency Ethics Official for purposes 
of the Ethics in Government Act, as amended, and the implementing 
regulations of the Office of Government Ethics, including 5 CFR part 
2638.
    (b) A Governor may obtain advice and guidance on questions of 
conflicts of interest, and may request any ruling provided for by 
either the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the

[[Page 78991]]

Executive Branch, or the Postal Service regulations supplemental 
thereto, from the General Counsel or a designated assistant.
    (c) If the General Counsel determines that a Governor is engaged in 
activity which involves a violation of federal statute or regulation, 
including the ethical conduct regulations contained in 5 CFR parts 2635 
and 7001, or conduct which creates the appearance of such a violation, 
he or she shall bring this to the attention of the Governor or shall 
notify the Chairman of the Board of Governors, or the Vice Chairman, as 
appropriate.


Sec.  10.3  Post-employment activities.

    Governors are subject to the restrictions on the post-employment 
activities of special Government employees imposed by 18 U.S.C. 207. 
Guidance concerning post-employment restrictions applicable to 
Governors may be obtained in accordance with section 10.2(b).


Sec.  10.4  Financial disclosure reports.

    (a) Requirement of submission of reports. At the time of their 
nomination, Governors complete a financial disclosure report which, 
under the practice of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, is 
kept confidential. Because the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics has ruled that Governors who do not perform the duties of their 
office for more than 60 days in any calendar year are not required to 
file financial disclosure reports that are open to the public, 
Governors file non-public reports annually, in accordance with this 
section. A Governor who performs the duties of his or her office for 
more than 60 days in a particular calendar year is required to file a 
public report in accordance with 5 CFR 2634.204(c).
    (b) Person with whom reports should be filed and time for filing. 
(1) A Governor shall file a financial disclosure report with the 
General Counsel on or before May 15 of each year when the Governor has 
been in office for more than 60 consecutive calendar days during the 
previous year.
    (2) The General Counsel may, for good cause shown, grant to a 
Governor an extension of up to 45 days. An additional extension of up 
to 45 days may be granted by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics for good cause shown.
    (c) Information required to be reported. Each report shall be a 
full and complete statement, on the form prescribed by the General 
Counsel and the Office of Government Ethics and in accordance with 
instructions issued by him or her. The form currently in use is 
Standard Form 278.
    (d) Reviewing reports. (1) Financial disclosure reports filed in 
accordance with the provisions of this section shall, within 60 days 
after the date of filing, be reviewed by the General Counsel who shall 
either approve the report, or make an initial determination that a 
conflict or appearance thereof exists. If the General Counsel 
determines initially that a conflict or the appearance of a conflict 
exists, he or she shall inform the Governor of his determination.
    (2) If the General Counsel considers that additional information is 
needed to complete the report or to allow an adequate review to be 
conducted, he or she shall request the reporting Governor to furnish 
that information by a specified date.
    (3) The General Counsel shall refer to the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors or the Vice Chairman the name of any Governor he or she has 
reasonable cause to believe has wrongfully failed to file a report or 
has falsified or wrongfully failed to report required information.
    (e) Custody of and public access to reports. (1) Retention of 
reports. Each report filed with the General Counsel shall be retained 
by him or her for a period of six years. After the six-year period, the 
report shall be destroyed unless needed in connection with an 
investigation then pending.
    (2) Confidentiality of reports. Unless a public report is required 
by this section, the financial disclosure reports filed by Governors 
shall not be made public.

PART 11--ADVISORY BOARDS (ARTICLE XI)

    Authority: 39 U.S.C. 202, 205, 401(2), (10), 402, 403.


Sec.  11.1  Establishment.

    The Board of Governors may create such advisory boards as it may 
deem appropriate and may appoint persons to serve thereon or may 
delegate such latter authority to the Postmaster General.

Stanley F. Mires,
Chief Counsel, Legislative.
