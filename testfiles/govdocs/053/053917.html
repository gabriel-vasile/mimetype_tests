<p class="Paragraph">Due to nearly non-stop coverage of a historic inauguration held amid major foreign and domestic crises, the new Obama administration dominated the news agenda last week, overwhelming every other story. Coverage of Obama&rsquo;s transformation from president-elect to president filled 45% of the time on TV and radio and space in print and online the week of Jan. 19-25. In the weeks following the election, the media&rsquo;s attention had been fairly evenly divided among a number of top stories, including the Obama transition, the financial crisis, the Rod Blagojevich scandal and the fighting in Gaza.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The decline of the U.S. newspaper industry has been so dramatic that rather than using terms like &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; or &ldquo;&rdquo;rightsizing,&rdquo; Doctor coins the term &ldquo;frightsizing.&rdquo;  The news remains glum for those inside the industry, with shrinking advertising revenue and share prices and increased job losses.  The transition online has been difficult and newspapers are finding that despite their declining audience, it takes an average of 20 online readers to generate the ad revenue of one print reader.  Yet, online news sources are easily stepping in to take their place and newsreaders today spend the same amount of time taking in news as they did a decade ago from print sources.  In the current confusing phase of transition, questions of journalistic trustworthiness and credibility have arisen, but so has a newfound energy.  &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see this new world in great clarity,&rdquo; Doctor concludes, &ldquo;but we can see its contours.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="Paragraph">Quart, CJR contributing editor, notes that the most successful journalists have learned a few lessons from rock music stars; for example, prominent journalists and musicians must both devote a great deal of time and effort maintaining a &ldquo;cross-media relationship with their fan base.&rdquo;&nbsp; Musicians build fan bases by using on-line and CD giveaways; journalists have taken to blogs, which give away information.  These activities create an online community spawned by the &ldquo;personal authenticity&rdquo; of the musician or journalist who makes himself accessible to his fans/readers.   The goal is to build a personal brand by giving away just enough of the product to motivate audiences to buy the product. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Under pressure to cut costs, more newspapers are cutting their Washington bureaus.&nbsp; And while the reporters experienced at covering the nation&rsquo;s capital go on to find jobs with niche markets, they are not informing the general public any longer.&nbsp; The sad outcome endangers American democracy, experts say, because only those in power are informed about what is happening and how to control it.&nbsp; Others say that those most interested in politics can get all the information they need from issue-oriented organizations, Internet sources and the contributions of online &ldquo;citizen journalists.&rdquo; </p>

<p class="Paragraph">For the sixth consecutive year, Iraq was the deadliest country in the world for the press, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists&rsquo; end-of-year analysis. The 11 deaths recorded in Iraq in 2008, while a sharp drop from prior years, remained among the highest annual tolls in CPJ history. Worldwide, CPJ found that 41 journalists were killed in direct connection to their work in 2008, down from 65 last year. It is investigating another 22 deaths to determine whether they were work-related. The decline in the worldwide death toll was largely attributable to Iraq, where deaths dropped from a record 32 in both 2007 and 2006. The decline in media deaths is consistent with an overall improvement in security conditions in Iraq, journalists told CPJ. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">As mainstream media retrenches from international news coverage, a new breed of citizen journalist is stepping in to fill parts of the void. Armed with cell phones, text messages, small digital cameras and blogs, citizen journalists can broadcast information from places the mainstream media simply isn&rsquo;t any more. These new voices present a variety of challenges and opportunities to the free flow of information. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Reporting on cultural events is a tough sell for overseas media outlets unless the topic directly relates to a bilateral relationship or a &ldquo;hard news&rdquo; interest, such as Japanese reporters in Washington covering the annual Cherry Blossom festival or American reporters writing about Middle Eastern culture due to some connection with the war on terror.  But cultural reporting is important as a means of understanding &ldquo;how people in other countries work, think, dream and worry,&rdquo; and language barriers and other obstacles should be overcome in order to improve this aspect of two-way communication offered by journalism.  In doing so, universal themes and truths can be discovered and encouraged which would increase mutual understanding.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">As the financial disaster unfolded on Wall Street, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson pressed Congress to pass the bailout plan but provided sparse justification for how he would spend the money.  The author notes that a disparate range of experts in economics and finance, including some well-known individuals, starting picking apart Paulson&rsquo;s plan live, on the Internet, in public blogs.  Many bloggers provided historical context and offered counterproposals; their readers began badgering their Congressional representatives to oppose the plan.  Whether the blogs influenced Washington&rsquo;s response to the crisis, notes Mihm, it&rsquo;s clear that policymakers &ldquo;are no longer operating alone.&rdquo;  The blogs are essentially a crash course in economics and finance, a &ldquo;conversation that's simultaneously esoteric and irreverent, combining technical discussions of liquidity traps and yield curves with profane putdowns and heckling headlines.&rdquo;  Many journalists used the blogs to fill in gaps in their knowledge of esoteric aspects of mortgage finance. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Although the intensity of the war in Afghanistan has surpassed that of Iraq, media coverage is failing to give it its due, says Ricchiardi, senior AJR contributing writer.  The number of Western journalists covering the war in Afghanistan is &ldquo;barely in double digits.&rdquo;  Lack of an interested audience is part of the problem, as is the high cost of putting reporters into a country with challenging topography and lack of infrastructure. Ricchiardi notes that journalists face the threat of kidnapping, robbery and murder whenever they move outside safe zones, and there is a growing risk of suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices.  Even so, given the importance of events in Afghanistan, the lack of information is a serious detriment to an informed citizenry. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">A fast-growing trend in newspapers is the charticle -- a bite-size combination of words, images and graphics.  Some newsrooms call them blurbs.  No matter what the name, these easy-to-digest forms for relaying information are becoming all the rage among newspapers eager to attract young readers away from the Internet and appeal to busy readers short on time.  Detractors say charticles contain too much personal opinion and lack detail.  Supporters say charticles are readable ways to present mundane information. </p>

<a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/overload_1.php?page=all">Full Text [HTML format]</a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">The vast amount of information available on the Internet, and the limited ability of human beings to consume it, is affecting news production, distribution and design.  It may also have a long-term negative effect on readers subjected to the overload, studies find.  Some news organizations, such as the Associated Press, have taken heed and altered their formats; nonetheless, interruptive clutter abounds.  Seemingly limitless freedom of choice becomes a burden which may change the roles of news agencies and journalists from being gatekeepers to guides through the information glut.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The question of &ldquo;who is a journalist&rdquo; is a thing of the past, with bloggers, amateur videographers, and others now widely recognized as falling within the &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; of mainstream journalism.  The author says barriers will continue to erode, and while more traditional journalists are adopting the less formal blogs along with news aggregates, the bloggers are also doing some original reporting, along with disseminating news and opinion.  The better question now is &ldquo;what is journalism&rdquo;; the author says the best of both worlds can be combined for the good of the public.  &ldquo;Old media will have to let go of some attitudes and assumptions that are no longer relevant, and new media will need to recognize standards that can infuse credibility and trust into this new journalism,&rdquo; she says.  The goal of the fourth estate to hold power accountable, inform the citizenry and strengthen democracy still remains intact in this new age of journalism, she argues.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The study argues that the U.S. media have hindered effective policy making on immigration for decades, and their impact has been increasing in recent years as a result of an ongoing evolution in the media industry. Deeply ingrained practices in American journalism have produced a narrative that conditions the public to associate immigration with illegality, crisis, controversy, and government failure. The objective is to understand how the media conditioned public opinion and the policy landscape, and the results show that the media, both traditional journalism and new forms of expression, need to be considered among the factors that contribute to polarization and distrust.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The media has played a significant role in convincing Americans that offshore drilling for oil in the United States could significantly lower the price of gasoline, according to the analysis. Even though the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Energy Information Agency has stated that the benefits from such drilling would be too small to have any significant effect on oil prices, the media has overwhelmingly conveyed the impression that it could. Media coverage of the issue may have influenced public opinion, with a majority now favoring expanded drilling, as proposed by presidential candidate John McCain.</p>

<a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/climate_change_now_what.php">Full Text [HTML format]</a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">Mounting scientific evidence demonstrates the reality of global warming and attendant climate change, so media coverage must move from simply covering the science to broader areas, including what governments, NGOs, businesses and ordinary citizens are doing about it. &ldquo;Climate change will require thoughtful leadership and coordination at news organizations,&rdquo; the author writes, while discussing coverage and its pitfalls. The science story is ongoing, but journalists unfamiliar with the subject must beware of oversimplifying or missing important scientific subtleties. Russell cautions that we need to be alert for &ldquo;techno-optimism&rdquo; -&ndash; renewable-energy proponents promoting the benefits without examining the potential downside. Climate change issues now touch politics, international relations, and commerce -- &ldquo;virtually all aspects of contemporary life;&rdquo; the author suggests coverage in science, technology, land use and transportation, economics and international cooperation. Monitoring what is done to slow deforestation in the tropics, estimated to account for one-fifth of man-made global carbon emissions, is one of &ldquo;countless questions&rdquo; about &ldquo;a story that is only going to get bigger&rdquo; over decades. &ldquo;The job of a professional journalist is to give the audience information that is good for them to know,&rdquo; said ABC News correspondent Bill Blakemore, adding &ldquo;The unprecedented nature of this story is quite grave.&rdquo;</p>

<a href="http://www.cjr.org/essay/boiler_room.php?page=all">Full Text [HTML format]</a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">The author, head of the business and finance desk at CJR, writes that while there have been many good articles about the subprime mortgage fiasco that has resulted in the widespread crisis in the credit markets, most have treated it as a &ldquo;kind of natural disaster or nasty turn in the business cycle.&rdquo; There is acknowledgement that abusive practices did occur, but Starkman writes that few have reported about how extensive they were. He says that the most comprehensive and insightful reporting on the system that produced the credit crisis was a story aired in May 2008 on (U.S.) National Public Radio, called &ldquo;The Giant Pool of Money&rdquo;. This narrative describes the global pool of savings, which had doubled to USD 70 trillion, was searching for higher returns, and the U.S. financial system, from the investment banks at the top, down to the mortgage brokers and salesmen across the country, was under tremendous pressure to create financial &ldquo;products&rdquo; for this money to invest in. Traditional underwriting procedures were abandoned in favor of aggressively selling loans to marginal borrowers. Some former loan company agents reported that the movie BOILER ROOM, about unethical stockbrokers, was used as a &ldquo;training tape&rdquo;. Starkman notes that systemic corruption and fraud has been revealed at lenders across the board. &ldquo;Yet to be explored fully&rdquo;, he writes, &ldquo;is the extent of Wall Street&rsquo;s role, and the size of the transfer of wealth from millions of civilians&rdquo; to the financial professional class.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">Repetition and prominence, not the ability to break news, give cable news television an enormous amount of clout, says Washington Post reporter Farhi. Using the example of the story of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama&rsquo;s responses to stories about his controversial minister, Farhi argues that &ldquo;few campaign stories have much impact or become an important part of the campaign narrative until they get heavy play on cable.&rdquo; The ability to function as &ldquo;an engine of reaction and response&rdquo; is cable television&rsquo;s greatest means for influence. &ldquo;Cable's intense and often immediate coverage of the day's big controversy forces candidates to fire back, which then compels the rest of the media to cover the response,&rdquo; Farhi says. Whether they like to admit it or not, print media reporters are forced to consider addressing stories of whatever degree of merit if, thanks to cable television, enough people are talking about it.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The Supreme Court holds that the First Amendment did not provide even a qualified privilege for journalists to refuse &ldquo;to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries.&rdquo; However, 49 states have adopted a journalists&rsquo; privilege in various types of proceedings. Journalists have no privilege in federal proceedings. On July 6, 2005, a federal district court in Washington, DC, found Judith Miller of the New York Times in contempt of court for refusing to cooperate in a grand jury investigation relating to the leak of the identity of an undercover CIA agent. The court ordered Ms. Miller to serve time in jail. Ms. Miller spent 85 days in jail. She secured her release only after her informant gave her permission to reveal his identity. Congress has considered creating a journalists&rsquo; privilege for federal proceedings, and bills to adopt a journalists&rsquo; privilege have been introduced in the 109th and 110th Congresses, in both the House and the Senate.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">In all aspects, ranging from staffing to content, American newspapers are changing at a dizzying rate.  In a survey of more than 250 local and national papers, the Project for Excellence in Journalism details developments such as the decline of independent foreign and national news coverage and the rise of mobile journalists deployed to send in video footage for the paper&rsquo;s Web site.  The analysis of its survey results gives a comprehensive look at the state of U.S. newspapers today and a glimpse into their uncertain future. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Debates about the state of the media marketplace continue to garner interest in Washington. Many policymakers, regulators, and consumer groups bemoan the supposed lack of &ldquo;localism,&rdquo; ownership concentration and an absence of quality programming as a rationale to further regulate in the media sector. The report shows that, contrary to what some media critics believe, there are more media choice, competition, and diversity than ever before. The report offers a comprehensive look at a variety of media sectors such as audio, video and print, providing policymakers with a snapshot of the media sector. </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Michael Happy, a Detroit News sports reporter, is blurring the lines between &ldquo;objective&rdquo; reporting and advocacy &ndash; and he doesn&rsquo;t care.  A former resident of Fletcher Field, a five-acre neighborhood near Detroit&rsquo;s City Airport, Happy launched last year a blog on the newspaper&rsquo;s Web site called &ldquo;Going Home: A Journal on Detroit&rsquo;s Neighborhoods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Working with community leaders, the blog has served as a voice to the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; poor and a tool for coalition building and advocacy.&nbsp; Current residents, many of whom do not have access to computers, funnel their personal stories to community leaders, who then communicate them to Happy.  Fletcher Field is still poor, rundown and extremely dangerous, but changes have been impressive.&nbsp; Thanks to the blog, the neighborhood has gotten attention and help from former residents and city officials who have mobilized to improve the park and overall living conditions.  Happy acknowledges that some observers feel the blog &ldquo;teeters on the line between ethical and unethical journalism,&rdquo; but he adds: &ldquo;I got into this business to try to help people&nbsp;-- I think the park project, its aftermath and this blog are doing just that.&rdquo; </p>

In a recent survey of Los Angeles-area TV stations, the Spanish-language stations had many more longer and deeply reported pieces, such as an explanation of the ongoing mortgage crisis, local politics and key policy issues in the presidential campaign.  While some critics complain that Spanish TV is more advocacy than journalism, the author notes that the &ldquo;upside of the advocacy approach is serious reporting and newscasts with broader perspectives; viewers are engaged more as citizens than consumers.&rdquo; </p>

<p class="Paragraph">Americans and the American press have lost
interest in the Iraq war, says Ricchiardi; coverage has dropped
dramatically, both on television and in print. Iraq has been shoved out
of the headlines in part because of the U.S. economic downturn and the
contentious presidential primaries. In addition &ldquo;war fatigue&rdquo; has set
in: the accounts of suicide bombings and brutal sectarian violence are
repetitive and hard to translate to U.S audiences. In addition, keeping
correspondents on the ground in Baghdad is getting to be too expensive
for many news agencies. But all this may change after the U.S.
presidential elections, when a new administration will have to grapple
with a controversial conflict that is costing U.S. taxpayers an
estimated $12.5 billion per month. </p>

media coverage of the presidential election in today&rsquo;s accelerated news
cycle, with round-the-clock cable television coverage and newspaper
journalists having to write for the Web as well as work on print
stories, has resulted in a barrage of superficial reporting, analysis
and forecasting, much of which has turned out to be inaccurate. As
established news media are offering buyouts to expensive, seasoned
reporters, younger reporters with less experience are covering the
campaign without the context of having covered several campaigns and
without the long view. Farhi writes that reporters should look beyond
the &ldquo;groupthink&rdquo; of the political insiders and pose hard questions to
the candidates. </p>

Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again, a serious work of
non-fiction. Both are books, but are very different texts. One would
probably want to read World War Z in a comfortable armchair or in the
bath, while Frum&rsquo;s work is better tackled at the desk, with pencil and
notepaper at hand &ndash; or even better, on one&rsquo;s computer screen, enabling
one to search the text, cut and paste key passages for future

<p>According to the study, global press freedom underwent a decline in 2007, with journalists struggling to work in increasingly hostile environments in almost every region in the world. The decline continues a six-year negative trend. However, there was some improvement in the regions with the least amount of press freedom: the Middle East and North Africa. The study attributes the improvement to a growing number of journalists who were willing to challenge government restraints. </p>

<p>Much has been written about the impact blogs and the Web in general have had on traditional print media.  Alterman, who teaches journalism at Brooklyn College, doesn't have much doubt that newspapers are dying; what is less clear, he argues, is what this portends for the future.  His prognosis is rather gloomy: "And so we are about to enter a fractured, chaotic world of news, characterized by superior community conversation but a decidedly diminished level of first-rate journalism."  His concluding remarks are even darker: "Just how an Internet-based news culture can spread the kind of &ldquo;light&rdquo; that is necessary to prevent terrible things, without the armies of reporters and photographers that newspapers have traditionally employed, is a question that even the most ardent democrat in John Dewey&rsquo;s tradition may not wish to see answered."</p>

<p>The state of the American news media is troubled and the problems seem different than those many experts have predicted. Some have tended to see technology &ldquo;democratizing&rdquo; the media and pushing traditional journalism into decline. But more and more it appears that the biggest problem is the decoupling of news and advertising as the latter has not fully migrated with the consumer to the online sites.</p>

<p>With traditional news organizations continuing to trim their budgets and reduce their staffs, long-term, labor-intensive investigative and enterprise journalism are more frequently made possible by funding from foundations and nonprofits, writes Guensburg, herself a former newspaper reporter who now writes for a nonprofit organization. The foundations are interested in compensating for what they see as diminished coverage of civic issues. And as paid advertising abandons print journalism for the Internet, news organizations are eager for new revenue. In 2005, U.S. foundations granted $158 million for media and communications. Journalism&rsquo;s funders include Carnegie, Ford and Pew Charitable Trusts. Knight, the leading journalism funder overall, announced more than $21 million in journalism grants in 2006 and more than $50 million in 2007. &ldquo;Done right, the journalism-funder relationship benefits both the parties as well as the public they aim to serve,&rdquo; Guensburg writes. But done wrong, it raises concerns about editorial objectivity. Some editors will accept grant money for training, but decline grant support for newsroom projects, fearing the merest hint of outside influence. Others see little difference between advertiser influence and donor influence on editorial sanctity.</p>

<p>Mainstream news outlets have embraced the Web log, making political blogs key features of campaign coverage.  The author interviews political bloggers from the Los Angeles Times, Reno Gazette-Journal, The Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune and The Washington Post.  They say blogs provide more information sooner, but it&rsquo;s demanding work and the results are unpredictable.  &ldquo;It is an online newsreel,&rdquo; says Michael Tackett of the Chicago Tribune&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Swamp,&rdquo; adding that anything goes: serious reporting comes alongside gossip, trivia and campaign ad videos.  Blogs allow greater freedom and can give a local flavor.  &ldquo;It is like a conversation, and it does not take as much context as a story because it is for people who know the context,&rdquo; says the Reno Gazette Journal&rsquo;s Anjeanette Damon.  But writing at a fever pitch opens the doors to more editorial slips and errors.  Cross-referencing competitors is new.  It is part of Internet culture to feature a &ldquo;blogroll,&rdquo; links to other similar blogs.  Blogs also invite readers to post comments.

<p>The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is launching the network&rsquo;s largest overseas expansion in over 20 years with new one-person foreign bureaus.  Technology makes the expansion affordable.  According to David Westin, ABC News president, &ldquo;We can do several of these (one-person bureaus) for the price of one traditional bureau.&rdquo;  A stand-alone multimedia reporter&rsquo;s equipment costs a mere $10,000.  The costs of running a traditional full-size bureau can run $500,000 per year.  The journalists who take on the new posts must be &ldquo;Jacks-of-all-trades&rdquo; who can handle digital video cameras, satellite dishes and laptops.  They will be expected to record, edit and transmit their own audio and video reports from places like Nairobi, Jakarta, Mumbai, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Dubai as well as neighboring countries.  Although most of their reporting will be for ABC&rsquo;s Internet outlets, the reporters will be expected to be first on the scene when a story breaks in their regions.  &ldquo;The correspondents aren&rsquo;t completely alone,&rdquo; Dorroh writes.  &ldquo;Each reports either to the London bureau or to the network&rsquo;s foreign desk in New York.  Colleagues at ABC&rsquo;s various platforms edit their work, and they get logistical and technical support locally from stringers and from ABC News partners like the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stampede is on among newspapers to put video on their Web sites; many see it at the key to their survival.  Video consumers are younger than the general population, have higher incomes and more education -&ndash; exactly the demographic newspapers as well as advertisers covet, writes Layton.  But not all stories lend themselves well to video treatment, however, and the quality of current video varies dramatically.  Training personnel is all-important.  And while an Internet audience might tolerate less than stellar visuals, they demand top-quality audio -- a new criteria for still photographers and writers who normally don&rsquo;t focus on background noise.  Video is labor-intensive, even for experienced still photographers.  A two- to three-minute video currently requires a minimum of two to four hours of production time.  The right equipment is crucial for photographers expected to bring back both still and video.  High-definition camcorders make it possible to extract or &ldquo;grab&rdquo; individual frames from the video.  But for writers working on short deadlines, producing a printable story as well as a video is nearly impossible.  Some writers, however, are making a clean break from print, finding that many stories can be better told visually.  Twenty-five-year-old Evelio Contreras, now a video producer at the Roanoke Times of Virginia, a daily newspaper with a 97,000 circulation, made the switch.  &ldquo;I saw it as a way to develop my storytelling skills,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>The foreign correspondent assigned to a country for a prolonged period with expertise in the local language, culture, history and customs is now a vanishing breed, Ricchiardi writes.  But as many U.S. news organizations have backed away from foreign news coverage, the Associated Press (AP) has made worldwide expansion part of its master plan for future growth.  Although newspapers around the United States are focusing on local news, buying AP products if and when they see the need, AP is pinning its hopes on new markets opening beyond North America&rsquo;s borders.  AP has recently doubled its reporting power in China, opened an office in Pyongyang, North Korea and will soon open a bureau in Saudi Arabia.  &ldquo;The AP family tree branches out to 243 bureaus in 97 countries, serving news outlets with a potential to reach 1 billion people each day,&rdquo; Ricchiardi writes.  AP is investing millions of dollars to upgrade communications among the bureaus worldwide, with an emphasis on high-speed data links and faster portable satellite phones.  More work is also being done to develop a more online-oriented international news product with emphasis on &ldquo;convergence journalism&rdquo; &ndash; a multiplatform approach to presenting information.</p>

<p>Teaching Khmer journalists investigative reporting is hard, even if the instructor is Cambodian and understands the culture and speaks the language, Putsata Reang discovered. Reang&rsquo;s family fled the Khmer Rouge 32 years earlier and was living in Corvallis, Oregon, when she decided to take an Alicia Patterson Fellowship to spend a year researching Cambodia&rsquo;s land-grabbing problems in 2005. She then took a job with a non-governmental agency to instruct Cambodian journalists in Western-style journalistic ethics. A former journalist for the San Jose Mercury News, Reang thought she was a perfect fit. But she soon discovered she wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the &ldquo;more nuanced challenges&rdquo; that working in media development in her homeland would present. First among these was forging trust and respect. Being a woman, an American citizen and drawing a relatively high salary from her NGO employer lowered her credibility among her peers. Reang also discovered that the poorly paid Cambodian journalists couldn&rsquo;t turn down the money they routinely were paid to attend press conferences. In addition to lacking writing and reporting experience, Cambodian journalists operate in a country with no freedom of information law &ndash; &ldquo;a place where telling the truth meant risking their lives,&rdquo; she writes. Although the program she was supporting did make significant headway and Reang was asked to stay on, she returned to the United States feeling confused and guilty over her &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; status.</p>

<p>This study considers the question of &ldquo;whether citizens define the news differently than professionals. . .&rdquo;  The report compared news from mainstream media for one week with the news found on user-news sites for the same period.  During this period, the mainstream press focused on Iraq and immigration while user-news sites (Reddit, Digg and Del.icio.us) centered on stories like Apple&rsquo;s new iphone and Nintendo passing Sony.  The data also revealed other subtle differences in user-driven content.</p>

<p><b>AA07378<br />  Lisheron, Mark   LYING TO GET THE TRUTH  (American Journalism Review, vol. 29, no. 5, October/November 2007, pp. 29-35)</b><br />
		<a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4403">Full Text</a></p>
<p>Should reporters use deception to get a story?  Lisheron, AJR contributing writer and a reporter at the Austin American-Statesman, examines this question in a lengthy article revolving around a story written by Ken Silverstein and published in Harper&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo;s July edition.  To get the story -- &ldquo;Their Men in Washington:  Undercover with D.C.&rsquo;s Lobbyists for Hire&rdquo; -- Silverstein posed as a consultant for a firm needing help in enticing investments to Turkmenistan, a country with a dismal human rights record but rich in oil.  The companies he targeted were APCO Associates, and Cassidy &amp; Associates, one of the most powerful lobbying firms in Washington.  Although Silverstein was able to extract interesting information about the sleazy lobbying culture and its impact on domestic and foreign policy, his undercover techniques aroused debate in the journalism establishment -- most especially Howard Kurtz, Washington Post media writer, who feels the companies targeted should have had at least an opportunity to Silverstein&rsquo;s allegations.  Is there room in the modern world for the &ldquo;muckraking&rdquo; tradition in journalism?  Lisheron seems to think not, writing that &ldquo;without at least some standard, the 230,000 subscribers to Harper&rsquo;s are on their own, trusting that liars and deceivers are telling them the truth.&rdquo; </p>

<p><b>AA07375<br />  Winston, Diane H.   BACK TO THE FUTURE: RELIGION, POLITICS, AND THE MEDIA  (American Quarterly, vol. 59, no. 3, September 2007, pp. 969-989)</b><br />
		Full text available from your nearest American Library</p>
<p>The author, who holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Southern California, believes that since 2000, many American journalists have had a &ldquo;come to Jesus&rdquo; experience.  Spurred by the rise of increasingly politicized religion and religious politics, they have rediscovered the role of religion in public life.  But is this current fascination only the latest two-step in a longstanding dance?  When New England&rsquo;s earliest colonists began circulating news of important events, they framed their stories with a religious perspective: divine providence played a decisive role in covering and interpreting everyday occurrences.  Since then, religion has continued to play an important role in the both the news media and in the news narratives that helped shape Americans&rsquo; self-understanding.  The author examines the religious tropes of the &ldquo;beloved community&rdquo; (left) and the &ldquo;promised land&rdquo; (right) that continue to dominate media coverage of American politics.  Focusing on the twentieth century, she explores how the mainstream media&rsquo;s hostility to religious conservatism has changed, and why progressive religious politics are rarely covered. </p>

<p>This study examined the daily news consumption of young people. The report is based on a nationwide, randomly-selected survey of 1,800 teens, young adults, and older adults. The findings show that young Americans rely more on television and the Internet for their news. This is a change from a few decades ago when there was not a significant difference between the daily news habits of younger and older Americans. Today, however, many young Americans find news here and there and do not make getting news part of their daily routine.</p>

<p>While American newspapers have reduced the resources and page space for book reviews, the decline is not altogether recent and there was no &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of book reviewing in the American broadsheet. While many attribute the decline to book sections&rsquo; failure to generate sufficient advertising revenue, sports and other newspaper sections are not expected to serve as profit centers. Newspapers have in any case failed to exploit the commercial possibilities of reaching their most affluent, educated subscribers through book coverage. The real problem is &ldquo;the anti-intellectual ethos in the nation&rsquo;s newsrooms.&rdquo; </p>

<p>U.S. federal judges have been rejecting reporters&rsquo; promises to keep silent about conversations with confidential sources, leading news organizations to warn sources that pledges of anonymity aren&rsquo;t absolute.  &ldquo;The law as it exists today does not provide the kind of absolute protection for sources that reporters traditionally thought they had the right to offer,&rdquo; says Kevin Baine of Williams &amp; Connolly, the law firm representing the Washington Post. But media lawyers are seeing growing support for protecting journalists, including at the state level, the author says.  Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia have shield laws, and seven additional states have introduced shield law legislation. </p>

<p>&ldquo;At least three journalists a month flee their home countries to escape threats of violence, imprisonment, or harassment.&rdquo;  This is one of the findings from a survey completed by the Committee to Protect Journalism (CPJ).  The survey was limited to journalists who fled persecution due to their work.  The survey did not include journalists and media workers who left for professional or financial reasons and those who fled prior to July 2001. </p>

<p>Traditional radio is the most widely used media in America--90 percent of Americans age 12 or older listen to radio each week.  The combined news/talk format leads in total number of stations per format, but trails country music in terms of national audience. </p>
<p>This report maintains that conservative talk radio dominates the news/talk format.  The analysis shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 257 news/talk stations owned by the top five commercial stations, 91 percent of the total weekday talk programming is conservative; </li>
<li>Each weekday, more than 2,570 hours of conservative talk are broadcast; and </li>
<li>In the top 10 markets, 76 percent of the programming is conservative. </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors assert that no matter how the data is analyzed, conservative talk programs have a greater number of hours than progressive shows.</p>

<p>Sunni insurgents in Iraq, their supporters, and sympathizers are pursuing a massive and far-reaching media campaign that shapes perceptions in Iraq and the Arab world.  This report surveys the products, producers, and the delivery methods.  The report shows that these media outlets undermine the authority of the Iraqi government, demonize coalition forces, promote sectarian strife, glorify terrorism, and perpetrate falsehoods. </p>
<p>The insurgent media also has vulnerabilities.  A lack of central coordination and message control and cultivating a rift between nationalists groups and global jihadists are serious challenges to their messages.</p>

<p>Media Matters analyzed the race/ethnicity and gender of the hosts and guests on major prime-time cable news programs during and after the Imus controversy (Monday, April 2 through Friday, April 27).  This study demonstrates that during this brief period &ldquo;cable news remains an overwhelmingly white and male preserve.&rdquo;  When an issue involves gender and/or race/ethnicity, the three major cable networks (CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC) bring a more diverse lineup of guests, but the rest of time the guest list are overwhelmingly white and male.</p>
<p>The conclusion reached is that &ldquo;if the cable-news networks want their guests to represent the full spectrum of Americans, they have a long way to go.&rdquo;</p>

		<a href="http://www.cjr.org/dispatch/style_over_substance_1.php">Full Text</a></p>
<p>The author, a fellow at Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Journalism where he is working on a memoir of the Kashmir conflict, critiques the Indian media.  Basharat writes that, at a time when India is gaining global clout, there are &ldquo;complicated stories that demand detailed reporting and space&rdquo; that are not getting sufficient air or print space in the Indian media.  With a few exceptions, there is an &ldquo;unwillingness to allocate resources and time&rdquo; for in-depth reporting.  Consequently, he says, foreign journalists produce some of the best journalism about India, and serious Indian writers often look to foreign publications to publish their work.  Although the American media was criticized domestically for not examining U.S. policies on torture earlier, he still credits the coverage, contrasting it with the Indian media where detailed newspaper reports on torture are rarely seen.</p>

		<a href="http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=4301">Full Text</a></p>
<p>From the news media&rsquo;s perspective, the Iraq war is different from previous conflicts -- journalists themselves frequently are the targets of the enemy, writes Ricchiardi.  For the fourth consecutive year, Iraq ranked as the world's deadliest spot for journalists in 2006, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  Since the invasion, 133 journalists and media support workers have been killed; 83 percent were locals, many with ties to Western media outlets.  CPJ reports that for the first time, murder has overtaken crossfire as the leading cause of deaths.  Ricchiardi writes that escalating threats to foreigners and astronomical security costs have led media companies to scale back their staffs.  As a result, she says, the numbers of correspondents in Iraq has dropped and coverage of what may be the most important story in the world today has been seriously compromised.  &ldquo;Though journalists struggle mightily to cut through the fog and spin,&rdquo; Ricchiardi writes, &ldquo;Americans are left without a complete account of a prolonged, bloody war that is devouring billions of taxpayers' dollars.  Correspondents are hamstrung when it comes to independently verifying information from military press briefings or rhetoric from the Pentagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Americans use distant sources of news and entertainment rather than local sources.  Critics of this globalization of information and entertainment &ldquo;claim that transnational media undermine civic engagement, transforming locally engaged citizens into viewers . . .&rdquo;  This paper utilizes &ldquo;the rapid growth of Hispanic communities in the United States to test whether the presence of local television news affects local civic behavior.  Spanish-language local television news programming was available in 25 US metro areas in 2002, up from only 14 areas in 1994.  Our estimates indicate that Hispanic voter turnout increased by  5 to 10 percentage points, relative to non-Hispanic voter turnout, in markets where local Spanish-language television news became available.  We conclude that the tradeoff between integrated media markets and civic engagement is real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verified facts versus commentary and opinion: the former is much more expensive, but while generation Y and Z prefer the blogosphere to "old fashioned" print, a case can still be made for turning to newspapers for professional journalistic values.  Wall Street might not agree however, and there seems little doubt that digital will prevail.  Kuttner argues that the way forward is for newspapers to become hybrids, embracing the Web but not abandoning the current generation of readers who still want to pick up a daily paper.  As an aside, Kuttner coins a new term for Web sites that mix blog-style comment with original analysis and serious research: crogs, for "Carefully-Researched Weblogs".</p>

<p>Many U.S. newspapers are cutting their editorial staffs and closing their international bureaus.  Most major metropolitan areas are dominated by only one newspaper, where there was once a competitive market.  Dietrich, with the Seattle Times and a 1988 Nieman Fellow, speculates that journalism as a profession is becoming obsolete.  The journalist&rsquo;s advantage in the past was the capability to gain access to information not readily available to the public, but that advantage is diminishing in an era when the Internet and simplified recording and video technologies allow any amateur to become a reporter. Dietrich notes that emerging amateur journalists today rarely purport to maintain the balance and objectivity that has always been a point of professional pride.  He also wonders whether this evolution of technology has devalued the role that the journalist has played in a democracy -- to not merely disseminate information, but help the public understand its importance.  Dietrich raises the possibility that newspapers may yet reinvent themselves to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace if they draw on their vast informational and archival resources.  This article is in a special issue of Neiman Reports, entitled &ldquo;Goodbye Gutenberg&rdquo;, examining the changing media landscape.</p>

<p>Blogs are meant to be fun and freewheeling; opinionated, "snarky", and in your face.  Newspaper reporting is meant to be balanced and well-researched.  Yet American newspapers have fallen in love with blogs, running anything from bowling to fly-fishing blogs.  Ideally, newspaper blogs should drive more traffic to their web sites, but will this current infatuation cause a dilution of traditional journalistic standards? "There's an inevitable clash of values between a newspaper, which has a journalistic reputation and brand name to protect, and a swiftly changing medium that has grown in power and prestige precisely because it has flouted many of journalism's traditional rules." </p>

<p>If one thought that YouTube.com was a lot of video doodling from online extroverts who want to put themselves in front of a camcorder, then think again, writes Garfield. Rather, the online video-sharing site represents the first ripples of a media tsunami that will crush the business model that sustains television as a profit-making enterprise.  The fast-growing popularity of YouTube means that the 21st century audience has lost interest in the type of programming traditionally produced by the big U.S. television networks, the article argues. Without an audience, television won&rsquo;t attract the advertisers who provide the revenue stream for big media.  Advertisers, known to be shy of controversy, venture with caution into an online world where the weird, wacky, vulgar and sarcastic are prevailing cultural values.  Further, the freewheeling world of make-it-yourself content defies the conventional legal structures for copyright protection and creators&rsquo; rights.  These uncertainties make the future of YouTube unclear, but Garfield argues its 100 million streams a day guarantee its longevity.</p>

<p>CJR&rsquo;s forty-fifth anniversary issue features the voices (saved as MP3 files) of over 45 journalists who have covered the war in Iraq. Their personal stories about the challenges of reporting from Iraq provide a rare insight into the complexities and the dangers of the war in a way that straight news reporting can&rsquo;t often capture.  They speak about their brushes with death; their attempts to blend into Iraqi culture and go undetected; their empathy with the civilians, the soldiers, the insurgents; and the competing political pressures to report the &ldquo;good news&rdquo;, and the sensitive news, such as friendly fire incidents.  The journalists include correspondents and photographers from major U.S. and British newspapers, television, wire, and radio networks, freelancer writers, as well as their Iraqi translators. Of these journalists, the Editors of CJR note: &ldquo;Many of these people have been in Iraq longer than some of our soldiers and diplomats. We need to hear them. They know things.&rdquo; </p>

<p>This is the fifth annual World Press Freedom Index issued by Reporters Without Borders.  The organization compiled a questionnaire with 50 criteria for assessing the state of press freedom in each country.  It includes every kind of violation directly affecting journalists (such as murders, imprisonment, physical attacks and threats) and news media (censorship, confiscation of issues, searches and harassment). The index also registers the degree of impunity enjoyed by those responsible for such violations.  It also takes account of the legal situation affecting the news media (such as penalties for press offenses, the existence of a state monopoly in certain areas and the existence of a regulatory body), and the behavior of the authorities towards the state-owned news media and the foreign press.  It also incorporates reviews of the main obstacles to the free flow of information on the Internet. </p>
<p>According to the index, Northern European countries once again come out on top, with no recorded censorship, threats, intimidation or physical reprisals in Finland, Ireland, Iceland and the Netherlands, which all share first place.  The countries with the tightest controls over media, according to the report, are China, Burma, Cuba, Eritrea, Turkmenistan and, in last place, North Korea. </p>

<p>The research for this report, which focused on six countries in Africa and Asia, indicates that HIV/AIDS reporting in affected regions is improving, but that there is still significant work to be done.  The research, including media monitoring which examined 356 articles that mentioned HIV/AIDS over the two-week monitoring periods in Africa and Asia, uncovered sensational reportage and terminology such as "deadly disease," "HIV holocaust," "scourge," and "deepest wound in society".   Images were more likely to be seen as sensational.  The researchers also noted that the complicated issue of confidentiality when identifying people living with HIV/AIDS, was a problem for media. </p>
<p>A significant proportion of journalists and NGOs surveyed said that HIV/AIDS reporting in their country could be sensational and derogatory, although coverage of HIV/AIDS orphans tended to be sympathetic, and coverage of medical breakthroughs tended to be neutral.  Despite low levels of literacy among the populations most at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, the research found greater coverage of HIV/AIDS stories in print media rather than in broadcast media.  Of the 356 stories sampled over the two-week monitoring periods, 281 (79%) were from the print media and 75 (21%) from the broadcast media. </p>
<p>The authors of the report call on media and journalist organizations to institute wide-ranging, regular and sustained training programs for journalists and editors on reporting HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Country reports included in the report are from Cambodia, India, Nigeria, Philippines, South Africa, and Zambia.</p>

<p>According to this report, eight percent of Internet users, or about 12 million American adults, keep a blog. Thirty-nine percent of Internet users, or about 57 million American adults, read blogs - a significant increase since the fall of 2005. Fifty-four percent of bloggers say that they have never published their writing or media creations anywhere else; 44 percent say they have published elsewhere. </p>
<p>While generally youthful, these writers otherwise represent a broad demographic spectrum of people who cite a variety of topics and motives for their blogging. The American blogosphere is dominated by those who use their blogs as personal journals. The survey that serves as the basis for the report, reveals that bloggers do not think of what they do as journalism. </p>
<p>Most bloggers say they cover a lot of different topics, but when asked to choose one main topic, 37 percent of bloggers cite "my life and experiences" as a primary topic of their blog. Politics and government ran a very distant second with 11 percent of bloggers citing those issues as their blog's main subject. Entertainment-related topics were the next most popular blog-type, with 7 percent of bloggers, followed by sports (6 percent), general news and current events (5 percent), business (5 percent), technology (4 percent), religion, spirituality or faith (2 percent), a specific hobby or a health problem or illness (each comprising 1 percent of bloggers). Other topics mentioned include opinions, volunteering, education, photography, causes and passions, and organizations.</p>

<p>In commenting on the development of media outlets in post-conflict situations, the report stresses that "in countries emerging out of war, both the character of private media in the absence of the development of civil society and a professional ethos of journalistic integrity, and the very real disintegrative pressures that may arise with an 'excess' of free speech, need to be considered when passing judgment on political authorities that are wary of giving free reign to media organisations."</p>
<p>The underlying tensions between the media and governments are described, as is the growing tendency of some politicians and journalists to aspire to become "media stars," with the provision of more air time and more influence. The authors provide examples of countries that are now undergoing some of the struggles described in the report. </p>

<p>Since 2003 the media world has seen the share of executive positions held by women increase only slightly, by two percentage points, to 29 percent. And the number of women publishers has remained the same, at 18 percent in the 137 newspapers surveyed. Women have some qualities that fit well with a constructive culture, say the authors of this report. Overall, women's leadership style tends to be inclusive and collaborative, rather than hierarchical, and they are often more attuned to the changing needs of the marketplace. </p>
<p>What women in the news field need to focus on now, according to Arnold and Nesbitt, is developing the leadership skills that they will need to develop a business. The report stresses that leaders must be willing to constantly step outside their comfort zone, take risks and tolerate some failures. As leaders, they also need to encourage others to do the same. </p>

<p><b>Callahan, Robert J. A VIEW FROM THE EMBASSY (American Journalism Review, April/May 2006, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 32-37)</b><br />

<p>Callahan, who served as press attach&eacute; at the US Embassy in Baghdad from June 2004 until May 2005, argues that criticism of media coverage of Iraq has come mainly from outside observers, not "from those of us who have been there and have seen these journalists at work".  He discusses the factors which make accurate and comprehensive reporting difficult, if not impossible.  These include danger  (in particular, the fear of being kidnapped and beheaded), lack of Arabic language skills, and the lack of reliable statistical data such as unemployment and economic growth.</p>
<p>On June 28, 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority was dissolved and sovereignty returned to an interim Iraqi government.  The American Embassy decided that it would no longer speak daily on the record but rather encourage Iraqis to speak for themselves.  The problem, however, was that, despite training, Iraqi spokesmen "couldn't manage the most basic public affairs work", including writing press releases.  Callahan then goes on to describe how journalists increasingly turned to the US Embassy, which had far greater resources than the press corps.  A key factor was the mutual trust that quickly developed between the diplomats and the media.</p>

<p>The author, an expert on Middle East media and co-author of AL-JAZEERA: THE STORY OF THE NETWORK THAT IS RATTLING GOVERNMENTS AND REDEFINING MODERN JOURNALISM, sees cautious optimism in Egypt, the most populous Arab country, because of recent electoral reforms.  He observes, however, "Although changes to Egypt's press appear substantial in recent years, a vibrant media system that encourages civil society, civic participation, and political empowerment remains a distant mirage."  He describes many of the changes as symbolic, pointing out that most national television coverage is strictly controlled by the government and that the publicized use of the Internet in the recent campaign was "ineffectual at best, and mere publicity stunts for foreign observers at worst." Although there has been incremental progress in the development of a free press, as shown by the reporting of historically ignored issues, such as electoral irregularities, rising unemployment, and widespread economic corruption, what is needed is "an unhindered, unadulterated free press enshrined in the constitution and supported by an independent judiciary."  This is one of the Forum series of articles entitled MOBILIZING MEDIA.</p>

<p>The author, editor of the United Press International Intelligence Desk, points out the symbiotic nature of the relationship between the media and politicians and stresses the influence of the media in humanitarian crises.  He contrasts the success in reporting on the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 with the so-called "March Incident" also in Kosovo in 2004.  Salhani notes that the media played a major role in shaping American perceptions of the 1999 Kosovo campaign as a "just war," unlike the U.S. intervention in Iraq.  But in 2004, following an incident in which some ethnic Albanian boys drowned while crossing a river after playing in a predominately Serbian area, the Albanian-language media, "instead of reporting the story as the sad accident that it was, blew it out of proportion."  This led to riots in which nineteen people were killed, about 600 wounded, thousands were evicted from their homes, and 35 Serbian Orthodox churches burned.  After a review of the role of the media in the situation, the author was brought to the region to conduct a 10-day crash course on journalistic ethics.</p>

<p>The author, who served in Iraq with the Marine Corps Reserve, asserts that many armed-forces personnel who have served in Iraq believe that we are winning the war, and are confident that the mission will result in self-rule by the Iraqis.  What they are not so confident of, he tells, is the resolve and commitment of America's media and political establishments.  Guardiano believes that the media portrayal of our military's efforts in Iraq has been "relentlessly negative and very misleading," and the "gloominess and pessimism is pronounced among the media elites of Washington and New York."  He asserts that "imbalances are everywhere," citing various examples of the media's focus on the negatives; notes that the latest "scandal," the U.S. military's alleged insertion of favorable articles in the Iraqi press as nothing more than a choice it made to "work within Iraq's nascent and fledgling civil society to try to ensure that Iraqis hear truthful and balanced accounts of what is happening."  Guardiano believes that Iraq is "a war of information and ideas ... we can win in Iraq, but not if we surrender in the media war."</p>

<p>Bloggers are constantly questioning, proofreading and second-guessing the mainstream media (MSM) in America, and Americans can't seem to get enough of it. Blogging has become such a staple attached to MSM, that it can be easily assumed to be fact-based reporting, rather that what is truly is, opinion-based ranting. The author sees fault in many of the large online news wires, such as The Washington Post and the New York Times, directly linking stories to blogs, pulling readers away from the stories, before they can even finish reading them, and analyze the information reported. He writes, "does the MSM really want to hasten its demise by making criticism of it -- often based on inaccurate information or purely partisan beliefs -- quite so accessible?" The instant analysis, counter-argument, and often-poor judgments that come with MSM support of blogging only undermines reporters and editors and their ethics and dedication to journalism.</p>

<p>During the gubernatorial elections in Virginia last year, "blogs became important enough that some campaign managers neglected their daily duties to obsess over the latest blogospheric gossip, state regulators began watching the blogs for compliance with campaign finance laws, lawmakers started grumbling about how to regulate speech on the blogs, and bloggers themselves began talking about setting standards and figuring out just how much coordination makes sense in a fraternity of extreme individualists".  Asked whether bloggers are journalists, Bob Gibson, political reporter at the Daily Progress in Charlottesville, commented, "I view them the way I do TV news &mdash; it's a headline service, a tip sheet.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, this report provides a comprehensive look at the state of American journalism, and the pressing issues facing the news media in 2005. The authors' goal is to put in one place as much original and aggregated data as possible about each of the major journalism sectors -- newspapers, magazines, network television, cable television, local television, the Internet, radio, ethnic and alternative media.  For each of the media sectors, they examine six different areas - content, audience trends, economics, ownership, newsroom investment, and public attitudes. </p>
<p>Their methodology of looking at a set of questions across various media, differs from the conventional way in which American journalism is analyzed -- one medium at a time.  This enabled the authors to make comparisons and identify cross-media trends.</p>
<p>From their research, the authors' drew five main conclusions about the nature of the media landscape:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are now several models of journalism, and the trajectory increasingly is toward those that are faster, looser, and cheaper.</li>
<li>The rise in partisanship of news consumption and the notion that people have retreated to their ideological corners for news has been widely exaggerated.</li>
<li>To adapt, journalism may have to move in the direction of making its work more transparent and more expert, and of widening the scope of its searchlight.</li>
<li>Despite the new demands, there is more evidence than ever that the mainstream media are investing only cautiously in building new audiences.</li>
<li>The three broadcast network news divisions face their most important moment of transition in decades.</li>

<p>The New York Times last year created a controversy when it began charging a fee for readers' online access to some of its top opinion columnists as well as to the Times' article archives. The paper was bucking the widespread presumption that web information should be free. At the same time, a number of big media companies are busily acquiring popular Internet sites, some of which the companies offer at no cost. Driving the fee controversy is a not-so-simple question: can newspaper stay in business if they give their work away? In this article, media publishers, marketing managers, and advertisers weigh in on the pros and cons of fee-based content and where it's headed. Although policies on paid content are in flux, the question inevitably will assume growing importance to media owners and readers in the future. </p>

<p>Publisher John Harold Johnson built a legacy celebrating the achievements and beauty of Black Americans.  According to media broadcaster Travis Smiley, Johnson took a $500 loan to launch his first magazine, and "built a media empire that 60 years later is still no. 1 and still 100 percent Black-owned."  Johnson, whose business empire included <i>Jet</i> magazine, <i>Ebony</i>, <i>Fashion Fair</i> and <i>Fashion Fair Cosmetics</i>, died of heart failure in Chicago on August 8, 2005.  In this tribute to Johnson, the author features the tributes paid to Johnson by such luminaries as President Clinton, who presented Johnson the Medal of Freedom in 1996, and the Reverend Jesse L.

<p>In a year in which journalists have taken as many hits as plugs, the author notes, the journalism field in Washington is as cutthroat as ever.  An increase in the number of news outlets means an increase in journalists, and quantity does not necessarily translate into quality.  This article outlines, in the opinion of journalists, who the fifty best and most influential reporters and writers are; the author notes that journalists who may be popular are not necessarily the most influential in Washington.  Some names have been on the list since 1973, including Robert Novak (Chicago-Sun Times) and Bob Woodward (Washington Post).  Many are newcomers, including Steve Coll (New Yorker), who recently won the Pulitzer for his book on terrorism, and Judy Miller (New York Times), for her commitment to ethical reporting and influence on the media.  A companion section looks at the "up-and-comers", who are reporting through the Internet, blogs, and other non-traditional media, and ruffling lots of government feathers in the process. </p>

<p>With only 295 self-identified Native-American journalists working at U.S. daily newspapers, American Indian viewpoints in the mainstream media have been limited. The sovereignty and diversity of 560 Indian tribal groups add to the difficulty--and potential rewards--of covering the stories of Indians off and on the reservation. Giago, who started the Lakota Times, the first independently owned Indian weekly publication in America, more than 20 years ago, writes about how he confronted challenges to freedom of the press from the local tribal council, as well as struggles to stay financially independent. Today, the newspaper can be found in all 50 states and 17 foreign countries. In a companion article, THE HEALING POWER OF WELL-REPORTED WORDS, Star Tribune reporter Larry Oakes describes how a community tragedy brought him back to the Cass Lake Indian reservation where he was raised. His subsequent reporting of the event provoked powerful and complex reactions from Indians and non-Indians alike. These articles are part of a special section, COVERING INDIAN COUNTRY, in the current issue of Nieman Reports, to commemorate American Indian Heritage Month in November.</p>

<p>Reporters not only covered the story, but became the story in this first-hand account by reporter Brian Thevenot, of Hurricane Katrina, one of the greatest natural disasters in U.S. history.  The author describes the struggles and horrors of a team of New Orleans Times-Picayune writers and photographers, who lived through the carnage and suffering in the days following the hurricane, in the heart of their hometown.  The team was determined to continue reporting from anywhere and by any means necessary.  Living in abandoned houses and cars, scrounging for food and communications to get the story to Baton Rouge for print, these reporters influenced and demanded action by all levels of government.  Thevenot writes that "in a repeat of the experience all of us had across the city, Russell [a reporter] never felt threatened.  By contrast, people cheered the sight of him -- the hometown Picayune reporter -- and grilled him about where they might get a paper."  In a time of unprecedented crisis, these reporters became the voice of the people.  </p>

<p>The case of Judith Miller, a New York Times reporter who was jailed for refusing to reveal a confidential source, has put the issues of confidentiality and the use of anonymous sources in the limelight.  But how can this happen in a country where the First Amendment to the Constitution is designed to prevent government interference with a free press?   The author delves into the use of confidential sources.  Strupp notes that some newsrooms now have policies against the use of confidential sources, and believes that these policies could limit a newspaper's ability to investigate instances of wrongdoing.  In other newsrooms, these policies could open up opportunities for better and more in-depth reporting; the author cites Eric Nalder, an investigative reporter for Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who believes that "there is a difference between using anonymous sources as the meat of the story, and tracking down the meat of the story." The Judith Miller case has yet to be resolved, but Judith Miller argues that "if journalists cannot be trusted to guarantee confidentiality, then journalists cannot function and there cannot be a free press." </p>

<p>Morning news shows have long been a tradition in American news broadcasting companies.  What began as a more relaxed version of traditional evening news programs is now the most profitable program for two of the three major networks.  While they do provide some coverage of hard news, the morning shows focus on celebrity and family programming, knowing that almost three quarters of their viewers are women in their 30s to their 50s.

<p>Independent media development led by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports the national security goal of developing sustainable democracies around the world. Independent media institutions play a role in supporting commerce, improving public health efforts, reducing corruption, and providing civic education. GAO was asked to examine:</p>
<ol>
<li>U.S. government funding for independent media development overseas;</li>
<li>The extent to which U.S. agencies measure performance toward achieving results; and</li>
<li>The challenges the United States faces in achieving results.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GAO found that the State Department and USAID obligated at least $40 million in fiscal year 2004 for the development of independent media, including activities such as journalism and business management training, and support for legal and regulatory frameworks. The GAO determined that State and USAID face challenges in designing performance indicators and accurately measuring and reporting results directly tied to the performance of U.S. independent media efforts. The performance indicators most frequently used by State and USAID are useful for determining the status of the media in selected countries, but are of limited utility in measuring the specific contributions of U.S.-sponsored programs and activities toward developing independent media in countries, when used alone.</p>
<p>GAO identified several country-specific and programmatic challenges that can impede the implementation of media development efforts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A changing political condition, or a lack of adequate civic and legal institutions; </li>
<li>The sustainability of local media outlets, and; </li>
<li>The unstructured or informal coordination of activities between donors and providers.</li>

<p>Johnson, a reporter for the Herald-Leader in Lexington, Kentucky, was given the assignment to check out the list of Kentucky's "Most Wanted".  She came across the story of Ralph Annis, convicted of first-degree murder in 1978 for the strangulation of his then girlfriend's infant daughter.  He served 10 years in a Kentucky Federal Prison, but then escaped in 1990 while on furlough.  Linda set out to dig up the story on Annis, and why he has eluded police for fifteen years.  Using basic Internet search engines, as well as reference databases such as Lexis-Nexus, Linda Johnston found Annis, living under an assumed name in Corpus Christi, Texas.  She worked with police, not wanting to jeopardize their case, but still wanting to keep the exclusive story.  Linda's probing and questions to ex-family members in Texas led a relative of Annis' to turn him in.  The police, however, released a statement taking most of the credit for the recapture of Annis.  The author wants all journalists to know that reference database knowledge and Internet searches can result in ground-breaking stories.</p>

<p>This annual survey, first published in 1980, assesses the degree of print, broadcast, and Internet freedom in countries around the world.  It assigns each country a numerical score from 0 to 100 that renders a category rating of "Free", "Partly Free", or "Not Free".  Ratings are determined by examining three broad categories: the legal environment in which media operate, political influences on reporting and access to information, and economic pressures on content and the dissemination of news.  The survey analyzes events during the 2004 calendar year.  Out of the 194 countries and territories examined, 75 (39 percent) were rated Free, while 50 (26 percent) were rated Partly Free and 69 (35 percent) were rated Not Free.</p>
<p>According to the survey, five countries improved in category while two declined.  In addition to Ukraine and Lebanon, Guatemala and Guinea-Bissau moved from Not Free to Partly Free, while Namibia moved from Partly Free to Free.  Only two countries -- Pakistan and Kenya -- registered a negative category shift in 2004, moving from Partly Free to Not Free.  The five worst rated countries in 2004 were Burma, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, and Turkmenistan.  In these states, independent media are either nonexistent or barely able to operate, the role of the press is reduced to serving as a mouthpiece for the ruling regime, and citizens' access to unbiased information is severely limited.  Press freedom conditions also remained dire in Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Sudan, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe, where authoritarian governments used legal pressure, imprisonment, and other forms of harassment to severely curtail the ability of independent media to report freely.</p>
<p>In terms of population, according to the report, 17 percent of the world's inhabitants live in countries that enjoy a Free press, while 38 percent have a Partly Free press and 45 percent have a Not Free press.  This situation represents a decline over the past year, as the percentage of people who live in countries with a Not Free media environment has increased by 2 percent.</p>

<p>Over the years Jerry Mitchell, a prize-winning investigative journalist for the Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, has helped bring many civil-rights crimes from 40-50 years ago to light, and his investigations has helped put many murderers behind bars.  Mitchell's most famous case was the work he did to track down the killer of NAACP field secretary Medgar Evers.  Mitchell's persistence and determination brought Ku Klux Klan member Byron de la Beckwith to trial in 1989, where he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.  Mitchell has dug through thousands of files, and brought many more unsolved civil rights murders to justice.</p>
