    and Stone Laboratory</p></td>

    <td>
      <p class="text">You may not think water clarity could be something to list
        as a home asset, but if you&rsquo;re a Lake Erie shoreline property owner,
        you may want to think again. New Ohio Sea Grant research by Drs. Elena
        Irwin and Tim Haab of Ohio State University finds that cleaner shoreline
        water can bring higher returns when selling a waterfront property on
      Lake Erie.</p>
      <div class="breakout">Cleaner, clearer water is a long-term managerial
        goal but we hope this data will show policymakers that there is a large
        dollar benefit (to their waterfront property owners) to make it a priority.<img src="/spotlite/images/quote-rt.gif" alt=" " width="18" height="13" border="0" /></div>
      <p class="text"> Like much of the waterfront property around the country,
        the demand for shoreline property bordering Lake Erie&rsquo;s eight Ohio
        counties has skyrocketed over the past 20 years. Residential development
        across the 312-mile stretch of shoreline has grown considerably, with
        amenity-packed counties like the Port Clinton area&rsquo;s Ottawa County
      increasing its urban shoreline areas even more. </p>
     <div class="border-left" style="width:195px;">
        <img src="/spotlite/2007/images/hotcommodity_kelleys.jpg" alt="Waves break on the shore at Kelley's Island" width="195" height="288" border="0" />
        <p class="caption"> New Sea Grant research finds cleaner water can bring
        higher returns for Lake Erie waterfront property.</p>
      </div>      <p class="text">As with most things,
        a growing demand sparks higher prices, and waterfront properties around
        Lake Erie are no exception, with average home prices in many areas starting
      at $500,000. </p>
      <p class="text">But could environmental amenities like clear lake water
        and nearby beaches have contributed to those housing prices being higher?
      Irwin&rsquo;s research finds they do.</p>
      <p class="text"> &ldquo;We knew from previous work
        that lake amenities like clean beaches, recreational amenities, and clear
        water are valued by individuals, however, we wanted to see if such amenities
        could actually influence housing prices around the Lake and if so, by
      how much,&rdquo; states Irwin.</p>
      <p class="text"> To do this, Irwin and Haab worked with
        graduate student Shihomi Ara to collect historical housing information
        from four predominantly-residential Lake counties, as well as data on
      the water quality associated with Lake Erie beaches.</p>
      <p class="text"> &ldquo;People view
        houses not as one good, but as a bundle of goods&mdash;house size, number
        of bathrooms, school district, and proximity to retail are a few of the
        factors that potential buyers evaluate when purchasing a home,&rdquo; explains
        Irwin. &ldquo;We wanted to add an environmental variable like water quality
      as one of those goods and compare it with the more traditional home amenities.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="text">Using
        two variables to define water quality, Irwin, Haab and Ara examined (1)
        fecal coliform bacteria data to average water quality over time and (2)
        secchi disk depth readings to average water clarity. They compared the
        bacteria and water clarity averages associated with the closest beach
        for each house and tested whether changes in these environmental variables
      had any impact on property values. </p>
      <div class="border-right" style="width:324px;">
        <img src="/spotlite/2007/images/hotcommodity_house.jpg" alt="This home on the Lake Erie shore increased in property value when water clarity improved." width="324" height="243" border="0" />
        <p class="caption"> Increased water clarity by 2 meters increased average
        property values by $4,308.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="text">What they found was when water clarity
        and quality increased, so did property values. But the amount changed
        drastically depending on which&mdash;water quality or water clarity&mdash;you
      were evaluating. </p>
      <p class="text">&ldquo;When bacterial counts in the water decreased to
        below beach advisory levels (200 bacteria counts per 100 milliliters)
        in one of our hypothetical scenarios, the price of an average home increased
      by 0.1 percent,&rdquo; explains Irwin.</p>
      <p class="text">&ldquo;However, when water clarity
        (how far you can see into the water) increased to two meters, the price
      of that home increased considerably more, to between four to five percent.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="text"> These
        increases in property values, Irwin points out, tell us that homeowners
        value both clear and clean Lake Erie water. &ldquo;But that five percent
      gain shows us that water clarity matters more,&rdquo; says Irwin.</p>
      <p class="text">Just
        how much more? Irwin compared increased water clarity to other home amenities
        such as home square footage, number of bathrooms, and school district
        ranking. What she discovered was that increasing the water clarity to
        two meters was the dollar equivalent to having that house in a better
      school district (see figure 1).</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/spotlite/2007/images/hotcommodity_chart.gif" alt="This chart shows that home values incresed with improved lakefront amenities." width="432" height="213" border="0" /></p>
      <p class="text">Proximity to a beach also added value
        to waterfront property. A house that is 10 miles closer to a beach would
        sell for an average of $7,470 more than the identical house located farther
        away. That $7,000+ gain is equivalent to the resale value of adding a
      bedroom.</p>
      <div class="border-left" style="width:288px;">
        <img src="/spotlite/2007/images/hotcommodity_picnic.jpg" alt="Picknickers would enjoy this beachfront spot on Lake Erie's shore." width="288" height="191" border="0" />
        <p class="caption"> Irwin and Haab&rsquo;s research determined that average
          property values increased by nearly $7,500 (or the same benefit as
          adding a bedroom) when the waterfront home was within 10 miles of a
        Lake Erie beach.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="text"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that these numbers
        are higher-end estimates because they assume no market changes. However,
        this research does show that there is a direct link to environmental
        amenities and increased economic value&mdash;if we increase the Lake&rsquo;s
        water quality or if a house is close to a beach, property owners can
      profit by a specific dollar amount,&rdquo; says Irwin.</p>
      <p class="text"> The hope is for
        policy makers and elected officials to try to strike a balance between
        economic growth and conservation management. &ldquo;Cleaner, clearer
        water is a long-term managerial goal but we hope this data will show
        policymakers that there is a large dollar benefit (to their waterfront
      property owners) to make it a priority,&rdquo; concludes Irwin. </p>
      <p class="text">Irwin,
        Haab, and Ara plan to expand on their research later this year by establishing
        exact benefits to water quality changes and estimating how other variables
        like beach advisories may affect housing values. </p>
