1. On May, 3, 2007, the Media Bureau released an Order denying Clarity Media’s
(Clarity) request for waiver of the CARS rules to operate CARS stations at Flying J travel 
Plazas.1
2. On June 4, 2007, Clarity and the KlaasKids Foundation both filed Applications 
for Review of the Bureau’s Order.2 Clarity filed a Motion for Extension of Time to extend the 
date for which replies to the opposition are due by 45 days based on a permit-but-disclose  
ex parte meeting in which Commission representatives suggested that Clarity further explore 
other options for their proposed distributed video service.3  Clarity requests the 45 day extension 
to allow time to further explore the suggested frequency band. Clarity states that they have 
received the consent for the extension of time from all interested parties.4
3. It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time are not routinely 
granted.5 Such extensions may be warranted when, among other things, new technological 
developments occur, or when it will promote resolution of the issues in contention.  In the instant 
proceeding, we note that it is beneficial to all interested parties and the public for Clarity to 
explore alternate methods for delivering its proposed service.
