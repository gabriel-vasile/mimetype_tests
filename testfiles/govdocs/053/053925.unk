                   DECLARATORY RULING AND ORDER
                                 

   Adopted:  March 19, 1999             Released:  March 19, 1999


By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau: 

                          INTRODUCTION
                                
     1.  The Commission, by the Chief, Mass Media Bureau, acting pursuant to delegated
authority, has before it a request for declaratory ruling filed by Clarity Wireless, Inc. ("Clarity")
pursuant to Section 1.2 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.2.  Clarity seeks approval for the
regular use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Modulation ("OFDM") at stations
operating in the Multipoint Distribution Service ("MDS") and the Instructional Television Fixed
Service ("ITFS").  For the reasons set out below, we are granting Clarity's request and adding OFDM
to the list of approved digital emissions for stations in these services. 

                          BACKGROUND  
                                
     2.  On July 9, 1996, the Commission adopted a declaratory ruling which permits stations
operating in the MDS and ITFS services to utilize certain digital emissions on a regular basis, so long
as those emissions meet certain requirements for power spectral uniformity and out-of-band emissions
("spectral mask").  Based on comprehensive laboratory test data submitted by the petitioners
requesting the Digital Declaratory Ruling, the Commission determined that the interference
potentials of Vestigial Sideband Modulation ("VSB") and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
("QAM") were no greater than that of NTSC analog video modulation, and these modulation formats
were adopted to be routinely authorized up to densities of 8-VSB and 64-QAM.  With respect to the
spectral mask, petitioners sought, and the Commission granted on an interim basis, an amendment
to the emission mask for MDS and ITFS stations using VSB and QAM to account for the significant
difference between the spectral occupancy pattern of these emissions and the spectral occupancy of
the NTSC analog video emission.  Additionally, with respect to the spectral occupancy of these
digital emissions, the Commission set out a requirement in the Digital Declaratory Ruling that the
power spectral density be "substantially uniform" across the occupied bandwidth, including at times
when no data (input signal) is applied to the transmitter.

     3.  In the MDS & ITFS Two-Way Order, the Commission, inter alia, amended its Rules for
the MDS and ITFS services to permit the regular use of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying ("QPSK")
modulation and Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA") modulation.  This action was based on
data and information submitted by ADC Telecommunications Corp. et al. ("ADC") in a petition for
declaratory ruling requesting the addition of these digital modulation formats for use at MDS and
ITFS stations.  Those petitioners argued, and the Commission agreed, that QPSK was essentially an
alternative designation for the already-permissible 4-QAM.  With respect to CDMA, petitioners
submitted the results of extensive laboratory testing which showed that CDMA presented essentially
the same potential for interference to NTSC signals as do VSB and QAM, and therefore could be
approved subject to the same technical restrictions applying to VSB and QAM.  The Commission
noted that it would "continue our policy of authorizing the use of other digital modulation formats
where such use can be demonstrated to be within the confines of the interference protection standards
for the MDS and ITFS services"; i.e., desired-to-undesired signal strength ratios of 45 dB for
cochannel stations and 0 dB for adjacent channel stations.

                  CLARITY PETITION & COMMENTS
                                
     4.  In its petition, Clarity submits that OFDM offers performance features not available in
other digital modulations, specifically, the means for "achieving very high data rates in severe
multipath conditions."  OFDM is generated by the creation of multiple signals (carriers) within an
authorized MDS or ITFS channel, each of which carrier is modulated with a portion of the
information being transmitted.  The signal modulating each of the carriers is typically a form of QAM,
e.g. QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM.  The amplitudes and spacings of the carriers are configured such
that the spectral energy of each carrier is significantly attenuated at the frequencies of each of the two
adjacent carriers.  The modulating QAM signals can be coded in order to be more robust in the
presence of multipath propagation and/or interference, and Clarity proposes the use of its proprietary
coding schema, designated Vector OFDM ("VOFDM").  Clarity retained the engineering firm of
Hardin & Associates ("Hardin") to evaluate OFDM and determine its compatibility with, and potential
for interference to, NTSC analog television signals.  In an attachment ("Hardin Study") to the Clarity
Petition, Hardin found, using laboratory tests, that OFDM "easily complies" with the interference
protection requirements of the Commission's Rules.  Hardin's laboratory tests were designed to
insure that the OFDM emissions complied with the mask required for digital MDS/ITFS emissions. 
Hardin's conclusions were based on evaluations of two different OFDM waveforms, one with 256
carriers modulated by 4-QAM and the other with 4096 carriers modulated by 64-QAM.

     5.  Comments on the Clarity Petition were submitted by PetroCom License Corp.,
UltimateCom Wireless, LLC and ADC, and reply comments were submitted by Cisco.   All were
supportive of the Clarity Petition.  Cisco urged the Commission to act expeditiously, arguing that,
in the near future, MDS and ITFS operators "will make decisions about digital equipment
procurement and deployment" and that "uncertainty may unnecessarily disadvantage OFDM
technology competing in the market with other digital modulation standards that the Commission has
already approved."

                    DISCUSSION             
                                
     6.  We agree with Cisco that prompt action on the Clarity Petition is warranted.  The
Commission's actions in the MDS & ITFS Two-Way Order enhanced significantly the ability of MDS
and ITFS licensees to offer a broad range of communications services to the public.  Many of these
services, such as high speed wireless Internet access, will depend on the availability and use of
sophisticated digital transmission facilities configured with differing modulation formats, depending
on the service being offered, the bandwidth used, path lengths, line-of-sight conditions and many
other factors.  For this reason, we believe it is in the public interest to authorize the use of additional
types of modulation when it can be demonstrated that the potential for interference will not exceed
that provided by the existing protection standards in the Rules.  We conclude that Clarity has met this
requirement, and we therefore are granting its petition to add OFDM to the list of approved emissions
for MDS and ITFS stations.  

     7.  Specifically, based upon the Hardin laboratory test results, we will permit the use of
OFDM modulation, coded or uncoded, so long as a minimum of 256 QAM-modulated carriers are
used and the transmitted signal complies with the spectral mask and power limitations set out in our
MDS and ITFS rules for digital emissions.  It should be understood clearly that this action is an
interim step in our overall consideration of the issue of digital modulation in the MDS and ITFS
spectrum, as were our actions in granting approval for VSB, QAM, QPSK and CDMA, pending the
establishment of permanent technical standards for MDS and ITFS digital operations.  We also
emphasize at this time that this Declaratory Ruling and Order and our actions with respect to digital
modulation in the Digital Declaratory Ruling and in the MDS & ITFS Two-Way Order apply only
to the MDS and ITFS services, and have no implications with respect to other services regulated by
the Commission.
