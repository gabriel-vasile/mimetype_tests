    counterclaim, set-off, and suit in equity" are omitted as
    unnecessary. The words " 'Bill' means bill of lading, governed by
    this chapter" are omitted because of section 80102 of the revised
    title. In clauses (1), (2), and (4), the words " 'Person' includes
    a corporation or partnership, or two or more persons having a joint
    or common interest" are omitted because of 1:1. In clause (3), the

    Sec. 80103. Negotiable and nonnegotiable bills

-STATUTE-
      (a) Negotiable Bills. - (1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the
    bill - 
        (A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a
      consignee; and
        (B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper
      that the bill is not negotiable.

      (2) Inserting in a negotiable bill of lading the name of a person
    to be notified of the arrival of the goods - 
        (A) does not limit its negotiability; and
        (B) is not notice to the purchaser of the goods of a right the
      named person has to the goods.

      (b) Nonnegotiable Bills. - (1) A bill of lading is nonnegotiable
    if the bill states that the goods are to be delivered to a
    consignee. The indorsement of a nonnegotiable bill does not - 
        (A) make the bill negotiable; or
        (B) give the transferee any additional right.

      (2) A common carrier issuing a nonnegotiable bill of lading must
    put "nonnegotiable" or "not negotiable" on the bill. This paragraph
    does not apply to an informal memorandum or acknowledgment.

    CHAPTER 801 - BILLS OF LADING

-HEAD-
    Sec. 80104. Form and requirements for negotiation

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Rules. - (1) A negotiable bill of lading may be
    negotiated by indorsement. An indorsement may be made in blank or
    to a specified person. If the goods are deliverable to the order of
    a specified person, then the bill must be indorsed by that person.
      (2) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by delivery
    when the common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes to
    deliver the goods to the order of a specified person and that
    person or a subsequent indorsee has indorsed the bill in blank.
      (3) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by a person
    possessing the bill, regardless of the way in which the person got
    possession, if - 
        (A) a common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes
      to deliver the goods to that person; or
        (B) when the bill is negotiated, it is in a form that allows it
      to be negotiated by delivery.

      (b) Validity Not Affected. - The validity of a negotiation of a
    bill of lading is not affected by the negotiation having been a
    breach of duty by the person making the negotiation, or by the
    owner of the bill having been deprived of possession by fraud,
    accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion, if the
    person to whom the bill is negotiated, or a person to whom the bill
    is subsequently negotiated, gives value for the bill in good faith
    and without notice of the breach of duty, fraud, accident, mistake,
    duress, loss, theft, or conversion.
      (c) Negotiation by Seller, Mortgagor, or Pledgor to Person
    Without Notice. - When goods for which a negotiable bill of lading
    has been issued are in a common carrier's possession, and the
    person to whom the bill has been issued retains possession of the
    bill after selling, mortgaging, or pledging the goods or bill, the
    subsequent negotiation of the bill by that person to another person
    receiving the bill for value, in good faith, and without notice of
    the prior sale, mortgage, or pledge has the same effect as if the
    first purchaser of the goods or bill had expressly authorized the
    subsequent negotiation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 80105. Title and rights affected by negotiation

-STATUTE-
      (a) Title. - When a negotiable bill of lading is negotiated - 
        (1) the person to whom it is negotiated acquires the title to
      the goods that - 
          (A) the person negotiating the bill had the ability to convey
        to a purchaser in good faith for value; and
          (B) the consignor and consignee had the ability to convey to
        such a purchaser; and

        (2) the common carrier issuing the bill becomes obligated
      directly to the person to whom the bill is negotiated to hold
      possession of the goods under the terms of the bill the same as
      if the carrier had issued the bill to that person.

      (b) Superiority of Rights. - When a negotiable bill of lading is
    negotiated to a person for value in good faith, that person's right
    to the goods for which the bill was issued is superior to a
    seller's lien or to a right to stop the transportation of the
    goods. This subsection applies whether the negotiation is made
    before or after the common carrier issuing the bill receives notice
    of the seller's claim. The carrier may deliver the goods to an
    unpaid seller only if the bill first is surrendered for
    cancellation.
      (c) Mortgagee and Lien Holder Rights Not Affected. - Except as
    provided in subsection (b) of this section, this chapter does not
    limit a right of a mortgagee or lien holder having a mortgage or
    lien on goods against a person that purchased for value in good
    faith from the owner, and got possession of the goods immediately
    before delivery to the common carrier.

    Sec. 80106. Transfer without negotiation

-STATUTE-
      (a) Delivery and Agreement. - The holder of a bill of lading may
    transfer the bill without negotiating it by delivery and agreement
    to transfer title to the bill or to the goods represented by it.
    Subject to the agreement, the person to whom the bill is
    transferred has title to the goods against the transferor.
      (b) Compelling Indorsement. - When a negotiable bill of lading is
    transferred for value by delivery without being negotiated and
    indorsement of the transferor is essential for negotiation, the
    transferee may compel the transferor to indorse the bill unless a
    contrary intention appears. The negotiation is effective when the
    indorsement is made.
      (c) Effect of Notification. - (1) When a transferee notifies the
    common carrier that a nonnegotiable bill of lading has been
    transferred under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier is
    obligated directly to the transferee for any obligations the
    carrier owed to the transferor immediately before the notification.
    However, before the carrier is notified, the transferee's title to
    the goods and right to acquire the obligations of the carrier may
    be defeated by - 
        (A) garnishment, attachment, or execution on the goods by a
      creditor of the transferor; or
        (B) notice to the carrier by the transferor or a purchaser from
      the transferor of a later purchase of the goods from the
      transferor.

      (2) A common carrier has been notified under this subsection only
    if - 
        (A) an officer or agent of the carrier, whose actual or
      apparent authority includes acting on the notification, has been
      notified; and
        (B) the officer or agent has had time, exercising reasonable
      diligence, to communicate with the agent having possession or
      control of the goods.

    Sec. 80107. Warranties and liability

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Rule. - Unless a contrary intention appears, a person
    negotiating or transferring a bill of lading for value warrants
    that - 
        (1) the bill is genuine;
        (2) the person has the right to transfer the bill and the title
      to the goods described in the bill;
        (3) the person does not know of a fact that would affect the
      validity or worth of the bill; and
        (4) the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular purpose
      when merchantability or fitness would have been implied if the
      agreement of the parties had been to transfer the goods without a
      bill of lading.

      (b) Security for Debt. - A person holding a bill of lading as
    security for a debt and in good faith demanding or receiving
    payment of the debt from another person does not warrant by the
    demand or receipt - 
        (1) the genuineness of the bill; or
        (2) the quantity or quality of the goods described in the bill.

      (c) Duplicates. - A common carrier issuing a bill of lading, on
    the face of which is the word "duplicate" or another word
    indicating that the bill is not an original bill, is liable the
    same as a person that represents and warrants that the bill is an
    accurate copy of an original bill properly issued. The carrier is
    not otherwise liable under the bill.
      (d) Indorser Liability. - Indorsement of a bill of lading does
    not make the indorser liable for failure of the common carrier or a
    previous indorser to fulfill its obligations.

    Sec. 80110. Duty to deliver goods

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Rules. - Except to the extent a common carrier
    establishes an excuse provided by law, the carrier must deliver
    goods covered by a bill of lading on demand of the consignee named
    in a nonnegotiable bill or the holder of a negotiable bill for the
    goods when the consignee or holder - 
        (1) offers in good faith to satisfy the lien of the carrier on
      the goods;
        (2) has possession of the bill and, if a negotiable bill,
      offers to indorse and give the bill to the carrier; and
        (3) agrees to sign, on delivery of the goods, a receipt for
      delivery if requested by the carrier.

      (b) Persons to Whom Goods May Be Delivered. - Subject to section
    80111 of this title, a common carrier may deliver the goods covered
    by a bill of lading to - 
        (1) a person entitled to their possession;
        (2) the consignee named in a nonnegotiable bill; or
        (3) a person in possession of a negotiable bill if - 
          (A) the goods are deliverable to the order of that person; or
          (B) the bill has been indorsed to that person or in blank by
        the consignee or another indorsee.

      (c) Common Carrier Claims of Title and Possession. - A claim by a
    common carrier that the carrier has title to goods or right to
    their possession is an excuse for nondelivery of the goods only if
    the title or right is derived from - 
        (1) a transfer made by the consignor or consignee after the
      shipment; or
        (2) the carrier's lien.

      (d) Adverse Claims. - If a person other than the consignee or the
    person in possession of a bill of lading claims title to or
    possession of goods and the common carrier knows of the claim, the
    carrier is not required to deliver the goods to any claimant until
    the carrier has had a reasonable time to decide the validity of the
    adverse claim or to bring a civil action to require all claimants
    to interplead.
      (e) Interpleader. - If at least 2 persons claim title to or
    possession of the goods, the common carrier may - 
        (1) bring a civil action to interplead all known claimants to
      the goods; or
        (2) require those claimants to interplead as a defense in an
      action brought against the carrier for nondelivery.

      (f) Third Person Claims Not a Defense. - Except as provided in
    subsections (b), (d), and (e) of this section, title or a right of
    a third person is not a defense to an action brought by the
    consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading or by the holder of a
    negotiable bill against the common carrier for failure to deliver
    the goods on demand unless enforced by legal process.

    (1), the words "civil action" are substituted for "an original
    suit" for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words "whichever is appropriate"

    Sec. 80111. Liability for delivery of goods

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Rules. - A common carrier is liable for damages to a
    person having title to, or right to possession of, goods when - 
        (1) the carrier delivers the goods to a person not entitled to
      their possession unless the delivery is authorized under section
      80110(b)(2) or (3) of this title;
        (2) the carrier makes a delivery under section 80110(b)(2) or
      (3) of this title after being requested by or for a person having
      title to, or right to possession of, the goods not to make the
      delivery; or
        (3) at the time of delivery under section 80110(b)(2) or (3) of
      this title, the carrier has information it is delivering the
      goods to a person not entitled to their possession.

      (b) Effectiveness of Request or Information. - A request or
    information is effective under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this
    section only if - 
        (1) an officer or agent of the carrier, whose actual or
      apparent authority includes acting on the request or information,
      has been given the request or information; and
        (2) the officer or agent has had time, exercising reasonable
      diligence, to stop delivery of the goods.

      (c) Failure To Take and Cancel Bills. - Except as provided in
    subsection (d) of this section, if a common carrier delivers goods
    for which a negotiable bill of lading has been issued without
    taking and canceling the bill, the carrier is liable for damages
    for failure to deliver the goods to a person purchasing the bill
    for value in good faith whether the purchase was before or after
    delivery and even when delivery was made to the person entitled to
    the goods. The carrier also is liable under this paragraph if part
    of the goods are delivered without taking and canceling the bill or
    plainly noting on the bill that a partial delivery was made and
    generally describing the goods or the remaining goods kept by the
    carrier.
      (d) Exceptions to Liability. - A common carrier is not liable for
    failure to deliver goods to the consignee or owner of the goods or
    a holder of the bill if - 
        (1) a delivery described in subsection (c) of this section was
      compelled by legal process;
        (2) the goods have been sold lawfully to satisfy the carrier's
      lien;
        (3) the goods have not been claimed; or
        (4) the goods are perishable or hazardous.

    Sec. 80112. Liability under negotiable bills issued in parts, sets,
      or duplicates

-STATUTE-
      (a) Parts and Sets. - A negotiable bill of lading issued in a
    State for the transportation of goods to a place in the 48
    contiguous States or the District of Columbia may not be issued in
    parts or sets. A common carrier issuing a bill in violation of this
    subsection is liable for damages for failure to deliver the goods
    to a purchaser of one part for value in good faith even though the
    purchase occurred after the carrier delivered the goods to a holder
    of one of the other parts.
      (b) Duplicates. - When at least 2 negotiable bills of lading are
    issued in a State for the same goods to be transported to a place
    in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, the word
    "duplicate" or another word indicating that the bill is not an
    original must be put plainly on the face of each bill except the
    original. A common carrier violating this subsection is liable for
    damages caused by the violation to a purchaser of the bill for
    value in good faith as an original bill even though the purchase
    occurred after the carrier delivered the goods to the holder of the
    original bill.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 80113. Liability for nonreceipt, misdescription, and improper
      loading

-STATUTE-
      (a) Liability for Nonreceipt and Misdescription. - Except as
    provided in this section, a common carrier issuing a bill of lading
    is liable for damages caused by nonreceipt by the carrier of any
    part of the goods by the date shown in the bill or by failure of
    the goods to correspond with the description contained in the bill.
    The carrier is liable to the owner of goods transported under a
    nonnegotiable bill (subject to the right of stoppage in transit) or
    to the holder of a negotiable bill if the owner or holder gave
    value in good faith relying on the description of the goods in the
    bill or on the shipment being made on the date shown in the bill.
      (b) Nonliability of Carriers. - A common carrier issuing a bill
    of lading is not liable under subsection (a) of this section - 
        (1) when the goods are loaded by the shipper;
        (2) when the bill - 
          (A) describes the goods in terms of marks or labels, or in a
        statement about kind, quantity, or condition; or
          (B) is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of
        packages unknown", "said to contain", "shipper's weight, load,
        and count", or words of the same meaning; and

        (3) to the extent the carrier does not know whether any part of
      the goods were received or conform to the description.

      (c) Liability for Improper Loading. - A common carrier issuing a
    bill of lading is not liable for damages caused by improper loading
    if - 
        (1) the shipper loads the goods; and
        (2) the bill contains the words "shipper's weight, load, and
      count", or words of the same meaning indicating the shipper
      loaded the goods.

      (d) Carrier's Duty To Determine Kind, Quantity, and Number. - (1)
    When bulk freight is loaded by a shipper that makes available to
    the common carrier adequate facilities for weighing the freight,
    the carrier must determine the kind and quantity of the freight
    within a reasonable time after receiving the written request of the
    shipper to make the determination. In that situation, inserting the
    words "shipper's weight" or words of the same meaning in the bill
    of lading has no effect.
      (2) When goods are loaded by a common carrier, the carrier must
    count the packages of goods, if package freight, and determine the
    kind and quantity, if bulk freight. In that situation, inserting in
    the bill of lading or in a notice, receipt, contract, rule, or
    tariff, the words "shipper's weight, load, and count" or words
    indicating that the shipper described and loaded the goods, has no
    effect except for freight concealed by packages.

      In subsection (a), the words "a common carrier issuing a bill of
    lading" are substituted for "If a bill of lading has been issued by
    a carrier or on his behalf by an agent or employee the scope of
    whose actual or apparent authority includes the receiving of goods
    and issuing bills of lading therefor for transportation in commerce
    among the several States and with foreign nations" to eliminate
    unnecessary words and for consistency with section 80102 of the
    revised title. The words "at the time of its issue" are omitted as
    surplus.
      In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "A common carrier
    issuing a bill of lading is not liable under subsection (a) of this
    section" are substituted for "such statements, if true, shall not
    make liable the carrier issuing the bill of lading" for clarity. In
    clause (1), the word "goods" is substituted for "package freight or
    bulk freight" for consistency in this chapter. In clause (2)(B),
    the quoted words are placed in quotation marks for consistency and
    to conform to section 7-301 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The
    words " 'shipper's weight, load, and count' " are added for
    consistency in this section.
      In subsection (d)(1), the words "makes available to the common
    carrier adequate facilities for weighing the freight" are
    substituted for "installs and maintains adequate facilities for
    weighing such freight, and the same are available to the carrier .
    . . when given a reasonable opportunity so to do" to eliminate
    unnecessary words. The words "In that situation, inserting the
    words 'shipper's weight' or other words of the same meaning in the
    bill of lading has no effect" are substituted for "and the carriers
    shall not in such cases insert in the bill of lading the words
    'Shipper's weight', or other words of like purport, and if so
    inserted contrary to the provisions of this section, said words
    shall be treated as null and void and as if not inserted therein"
    for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d)(2), the words "and such carrier shall not, in
    such cases" are omitted as surplus. The words "In that situation .
    . . has no effect" are substituted for 49 App.:100 (last sentence)
    for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "except
    for freight concealed by packages" are substituted for "or in case
    of bulk freight and freight not concealed by packages the
    description made by him" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary
    words.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Delivery on Court Order and Surety Bond. - If a negotiable
    bill of lading is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court of competent
    jurisdiction may order the common carrier to deliver the goods if
    the person claiming the goods gives a surety bond, in an amount
    approved by the court, to indemnify the carrier or a person injured
    by delivery against liability under the outstanding original bill.
    The court also may order payment of reasonable costs and attorney's
    fees to the carrier. A voluntary surety bond, without court order,
    is binding on the parties to the bond.
      (b) Liability to Holder. - Delivery of goods under a court order
    under subsection (a) of this section does not relieve a common
    carrier from liability to a person to whom the negotiable bill has
    been or is negotiated for value without notice of the court
    proceeding or of the delivery of the goods.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Attachment and Levy. - Except when a negotiable bill of
    lading was issued originally on delivery of goods by a person that
    did not have the power to dispose of the goods, goods in the
    possession of a common carrier for which a negotiable bill has been
    issued may be attached through judicial process or levied on in
    execution of a judgment only if the bill is surrendered to the
    carrier or its negotiation is enjoined.
      (b) Delivery. - A common carrier may be compelled by judicial
    process to deliver goods under subsection (a) of this section only
    when the bill is surrendered to the carrier or impounded by the
    court.

      In subsection (a), the words "Except when a negotiable bill of
    lading was issued originally on delivery of goods by a person that
    did not have the power to dispose of the goods, goods . . . may be
    attached . . . only if" are substituted for "If goods are delivered
    to a carrier by the owner or by a person whose act in conveying the
    title to them to a purchaser for value in good faith would bind the
    owner . . . they can not thereafter . . . be attached . . . unless"
    to restate the source provision as an exception to conform to
    section 7-602 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The words "through
    judicial process" are substituted for "by garnishment or
    otherwise", and the words "levied on in execution of a judgment"
    are substituted for "levied upon under an execution", for clarity.

      In this section, before clause (1), the words "fined under title
    18" are substituted for "a fine not exceeding $5,000", and the
    words "shall be guilty of a misdemeanor" are omitted, for
    consistency with title 18. The words "upon conviction . . .
    punished for each offense" are omitted as unnecessary because of
    the restatement. Clause (1) is substituted for "or who, with intent
    to defraud, violates, or fails to comply with, or aids in any
    violation of, or failure to comply with any provision of this
    chapter" for clarity and because of 18:2. In clause (2)(A), the
    words "forges, counterfeits" are omitted as being included in
    "makes". The word "copies" is substituted for "prints or
    photographs" for clarity. The words "bill of lading subject to this
    chapter" are substituted for "bill of lading purporting to
    represent goods received for shipment among the several States or
    with foreign nations" for clarity and for consistency with section
    80102 of the revised title. Clause (2)(B) is substituted for
    "utters or publishes as true and genuine any such falsely altered,
    forged, counterfeited, falsely printed or photographed bill of
    lading . . . or issues" to eliminate unnecessary words and for
    consistency in this section. The words "knowing it to be falsely
    altered, forged, counterfeited, falsely printed or photographed"
    are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the intent
    required to commit the crime. The words "or aids in making,
    altering, forging, counterfeiting, printing or photographing, or
    uttering or publishing the same . . . or aids in issuing or
    procuring the issue of" are omitted as surplus because of 18:2. The
    words "as to the receipt of the goods, or as to any other matter"
    are omitted as unnecessary.
