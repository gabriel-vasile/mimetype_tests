-HEAD-
    Sec. 30502. National Motor Vehicle Title Information System

-STATUTE-
      (a) Establishment or Designation. - (1) In cooperation with the
    States and not later than December 31, 1997, the Attorney General
    shall establish a National Motor Vehicle Title Information System
    that will provide individuals and entities referred to in
    subsection (e) of this section with instant and reliable access to
    information maintained by the States related to automobile titling
    described in subsection (d) of this section. However, if the
    Attorney General decides that the existing information system meets
    the requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of this section and
    will permit the Attorney General to carry out this chapter as early
    as possible, the Attorney General, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Transportation, may designate an existing information
    system as the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System.
      (2) In cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation and the
    States, the Attorney General shall ascertain the extent to which
    title and related information to be included in the system
    established under paragraph (1) of this subsection will be
    adequate, timely, reliable, uniform, and capable of assisting in
    efforts to prevent the introduction or reintroduction of stolen
    vehicles and parts into interstate commerce.
      (b) Operation. - The Attorney General may authorize the operation
    of the System established or designated under subsection (a)(1) of
    this section by agreement with one or more States, or by
    designating, after consulting with the States, a third party that
    represents the interests of the States.
      (c) User Fees. - Operation of the System established or
    designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be paid
    for by user fees and should be self-sufficient and not be dependent
    on amounts from the United States Government. The amount of fees
    the operator collects and keeps under this subsection subject to
    annual appropriation laws, excluding fees the operator collects and
    pays to an entity providing information to the operator, may be not
    more than the costs of operating the System.
      (d) Information Requirements. - The System established or
    designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall permit a
    user of the System at least to establish instantly and reliably - 
        (1) the validity and status of a document purporting to be a
      certificate of title;
        (2) whether an automobile bearing a known vehicle
      identification number is titled in a particular State;
        (3) whether an automobile known to be titled in a particular
      State is or has been a junk automobile or a salvage automobile;
        (4) for an automobile known to be titled in a particular State,
      the odometer mileage disclosure required under section 32705 of
      this title for that automobile on the date the certificate of
      title for that automobile was issued and any later mileage
      information, if noted by the State; and
        (5) whether an automobile bearing a known vehicle
      identification number has been reported as a junk automobile or a
      salvage automobile under section 30504 of this title.

      (e) Availability of Information. - (1) The operator shall make
    available - 
        (A) to a participating State on request of that State,
      information in the System about any automobile;
        (B) to a Government, State, or local law enforcement official
      on request of that official, information in the System about a
      particular automobile, junk yard, or salvage yard;
        (C) to a prospective purchaser of an automobile on request of
      that purchaser, including an auction company or entity engaged in
      the business of purchasing used automobiles, information in the
      System about that automobile; and
        (D) to a prospective or current insurer of an automobile on
      request of that insurer, information in the System about that
      automobile.

      (2) The operator may release only the information reasonably
    necessary to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1) of this
    subsection. The operator may not collect an individual's social
    security account number or permit users of the System to obtain an
    individual's address or social security account number.
      (f) Immunity. - Any person performing any activity under this
    section or sections 30503 or 30504 in good faith and with the
    reasonable belief that such activity was in accordance with this
    section or section 30503 or 30504, as the case may be, shall be
    immune from any civil action respecting such activity which is
    seeking money damages or equitable relief in any court of the
    United States or a State.
