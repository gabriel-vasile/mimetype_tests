SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) administers
regulations published in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations. These
regulations are updated April 1 of each year to incorporate new or
revised regulations that were published by ATF in the Federal Register
during the preceding year. ATF identified several amendments that are
needed to provide clarity and uniformity to the regulations in 27 CFR.
    These amendments do not make any substantive changes and are only
intended to improve the clarity of title 27.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law
104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR
part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because there are no
recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et
seq.) do not apply to this rule because no notice of proposed
rulemaking is required.

Executive Order 12866

    This final rule is not subject to the requirements of Executive
Order 12866 because the regulations make nonsubstantive technical
corrections to previously published regulations.

Administrative Procedure Act

    Because this final rule merely makes technical corrections to
improve the clarity of the regulations, it is unnecessary to issue this
final rule with notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or
subject to the effective date limitation in section 553(d).
