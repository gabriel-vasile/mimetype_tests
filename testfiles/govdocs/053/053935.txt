                  DECLARATORY RULING AND ORDER

  Adopted:  September 25, 2001          Released: September 26, 2001

By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau:

                        I.  INTRODUCTION

1.   The Commission, by the Chief, Mass Media Bureau, acting pursuant to delegated
authority, has before it a request for declaratory ruling filed by Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco")
pursuant to Section 1.2 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.2. Cisco requests that the
Commission amend its rules to eliminate the requirement that a minimum of 256 QAM-modulated
carriers be used with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing ("OFDM") modulation in the
Multipoint Distribution Service ("MDS") and the Instructional Television Fixed Service ("ITFS"). 
For the reasons set out below, we are granting Cisco's petition.

                        II.  BACKGROUND

2.   On July 9, 1996, the Commission adopted a declaratory ruling which permits MDS
and ITFS stations to use Vestigial Sideband Modulation ("VSB") and Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation ("QAM") on a regular basis so long as they meet certain technical requirements.  In a
subsequent rulemaking, the Commission expanded the list of permissible MDS and ITFS
modulations to include Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA") and Quadrature Phase Shift
Keying ("QPSK").  On August 31, 1998, Clarity Wireless, Inc. ("Clarity") filed a Petition for
Declaratory Ruling requesting that the Commission further expand the list of permissible MDS and
ITFS emissions to include OFDM.  In support of its petition, Clarity submitted the results of
laboratory tests evaluating the technical characteristics of two different OFDM waveforms, one with
256 carriers, each modulated by a 4-QAM signal, and one with 4096 carriers, each modulated by a
64-QAM signal.  These tests demonstrated that both of the OFDM emissions complied with the
Commission's spectral mask requirements and would present no greater interference potential than
other, previously authorized, digital emissions. On March 19, 1999, the Commission granted the
Clarity petition and authorized the use of OFDM, with the condition that a minimum of 256 QAM-
modulated carriers must be utilized.

3.   In its petition, Cisco requests that the Commission remove the condition that a
minimum of 256 QAM-modulated carriers must be used for OFDM.  Cisco states that its earlier use
in laboratory tests of  a lower limit of 256 carriers was meant to generate "worst case OFDM signals
whose power spectral density completely filled the spectral mask in the Commission's rules."  Cisco
argues that the use of fewer than 256 carriers should be permitted because the potential for
interference from such OFDM signals will be no greater than the interference from OFDM signals
using 256 or more carriers. The ability to use fewer than 256 carriers, Cisco argues, would "allow
MDS/ITFS network designers to make important bandwidth and design trade-offs to meet customer
bandwidth and cost requirements."  This would occur because of the direct linkage between the
number of carriers and the bandwidth occupied by those carriers, i.e., as fewer carriers are utilized,
less bandwidth is needed.  

4.   In response to the Commission's Public Notice requesting comment on Cisco's
request for a declaratory ruling, comments were filed by Wireless Communications Association
International ("WCAI"), Wi-LAN, Inc. ("Wi-LAN"), and the Catholic Television Network ("CTN"). 
Reply comments were filed by Cisco Systems.  WCAI and Wi-LAN fully supported the Cisco
request, citing advantages to the removal of the limitation in the number of carriers permitted for
OFDM and urging the Commission to remove this limitation. Wi-LAN also urged the Commission
to permit, in addition to QAM modulation of OFDM carriers, Binary Phase Shift Keying ("BPSK")
and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying ("QPSK") modulation of the OFDM carriers.  CTN, while also
supporting removal of the carrier limitation, expressed concerns about the interference potential of
OFDM emissions with fewer than 256 carriers, and asked that the removal of the limitation be
accompanied by an amendment to the Commission's rules which would, in their view, prevent such
interference from occurring.  

5.   Specifically, CTN is concerned that "lower level QAM spectral energy may
concentrate in certain portions of a 6 MHz channel," and that "unless there is a randomizer . . . in
the digital encoder, then it is possible in a steady state for the spectral energy to concentrate and
increase in amplitude."  CTN argues that even if "a lower level QAM signal met the 45 dB D/U co-
channel interference ratio in its spread out state, the D/U ratio may degrade to an interference-
causing sub-45 dB during steady state video modulation conditions."  To remedy this concern, CTN
suggests that the Commission adopt one of two requirements for sub-256 carrier OFDM, either: (a)
"the proposed transmission meets the 45 dB D/U interference ratio as to all relevant co-channel
stations for the worst case digital spectral energy signature;" or (b) "the digital encoder include a
randomizer that ensures the spectral energy is spread over the entire channel bandwidth."  In reply
comments addressing CTN's proposed new requirements for OFDM, Cisco disputes CTN's
contention that any new rules are needed, arguing that existing Commission rules already fully
address the issues raised by CTN.  

                        III.  DISCUSSION

6.   We agree with Cisco that no purpose is served by continuing the limitation on the
minimum number of carriers which can be utilized for OFDM.  The channelization rules for MDS
and ITFS permit the use of a very wide range of bandwidths, from tens of kHz to tens of MHz, and
it is important that licensees have available to them the flexibility to use the particular digital
emissions and bandwidths that meet their operational needs.  Removal of the 256 carrier limitation
from OFDM would enable licensees to choose from a significantly wider range of bandwidths and
data rates than is now permissible with OFDM, e.g., for bandwidths on the order of 50-100 kHz, as
few as 4 to 8 carriers may be optimum, whereas for bandwidths on the order of 750 kHz to 1.5 MHz,
64 to 128 carriers may be optimum.

7.   With respect to CTN's interference concerns, while we concur that "symbol patterns"
may occur with the use of OFDM emissions having fewer than 256 carriers, it is also true that this
phenomenon occurs when more than 256 carriers are used and that such a concentration of power
in a segment of a wider channel is simply a transient form of  the more general occurrence of power
spectral non-uniformity commonly associated with some digital emissions.  However, we believe
that Cisco has adequately demonstrated that this non-uniformity, if and when it occurs, will not have
any adverse impact on the potential for harmful interference in MDS and the ITFS systems, in that
the range of OFDM emissions which will now be permitted are already fully addressed by the
interference protection and power spectral density provisions of our rules.  Specifically, all forms
of OFDM are subject to the existing rule requirements for interference protection of MDS and ITFS
stations, such as Section 21.902, as well as subject to the existing rule requirements governing
emissions with respect to power spectral density, both uniform and non-uniform, such as Section
21.904(e).  We therefore are granting Cisco's request to remove the 256 carrier restriction from
OFDM and we reject CTN's request that additional requirements be placed on OFDM emissions
with fewer than 256 carriers.  

                     IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES

8.   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that under the authority contained in Section 4(i) of
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), and Section 554(e) of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554(e), the Petition for Declaratory Ruling submitted by
Cisco Systems, Inc. IS GRANTED to the extent specified above.  This Declaratory Ruling and Order
shall be effective upon its release and shall remain effective pending adoption of rules specifically
governing the use of digital emissions in MDS and ITFS in a future rulemaking proceeding.  See 47
C.F.R. 1.4(b)(2) and 1.103.  Nothing in this Declaratory Ruling and Order shall prejudice the
outcome of such a rulemaking proceeding.

9.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the staff of the Mass Media Bureau shall send
copies of this Declaratory Ruling and Order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the parties
who filed formal comments and reply comments in response to the Commission's June 5, 2001
Public Notice.
