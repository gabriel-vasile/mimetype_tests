      Title:
        Remote Sensing of Water Turbidity and Sedimentation and Their
        Relationship to Algal Blooms

  Description:
    Abstract:
      A decline in water clarity in Florida Bay has been observed following
      the seagrass dieoffs starting in the late 1980's. Algal blooms and
      discolored water have been reported in Florida Bay over the last
      several years and factors such as resuspension of material and
      nutrients from the bottom have been suggested as a cause. Monthly
      monitoring programs by Florida International University (FIU) and
      Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have provided
      documentation of blooms through chlorophyll measurements. This study
      is using remote sensing to examine resuspension events, the
      distribution of turbid water and changes in the patterns of water
      clarity in the Bay.
    Purpose:
      The project is conducting comparisons between chlorophyll values
      collected from the shipboard monitoring programs and pre-cruise
      reflectances to assess whether there is a link between resuspension
      events and algal blooms. The next stage in the project is to expand
      the AVHRR data set backward to before the seagrass dieoffs and to
      incorporate Landsat data for limited high resolution analysis.

      Process_Description:
        The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA 600
        usable scenes are available from some 1500 covering a period from
        December 1989 to the present. AVHRR has a pixel size of about 1.1
        km.  The data sets are processed for water reflectance, which is
        related to water turbidity variables such as attenuation, Secchi
        depths, total particulate matter, and nephelometric turbidity. 
        Tentative relationships with these variables have been made. (Sea
        surface temperature is also determined.)  High reflectance
        corresponds to high attenuation or particulate loads or shallow
        Secchi depth. The individual scenes are also processed to obtain
        monthly and seasonal means, with winter corresponding to the period
        of December to March and summer to June through September. Initial
        analyses include the points corresponding to fixed stations occupied
        at a monthly interval by FIU or FDEP.  In examining the average
        reflectance of the entire Bay, the satellite imagery does not show a
        trend between December 1989 and September 1996. The seasonal pattern
        of high turbidity in winter and low in summer is evident. Trends
        over the time period appear in subsections of the Bay.  A
        substantial increase in water reflectance is evident in the
        north-central Bay (which has been documented in field studies, this
        region includes Rankin Lake and Johnson Key.  However these appear
        to have different phasing, with Johnson Key showing an increase in
        turbidity about two years earlier than Rankin Lake. Both sites show
        the decline in both winter and summer. Twin Key, which has the
        clearest water in the Bay, has shown a slight increase. The
        southwest portion of the Bay, west of Sprigger Bank, has shown a
        decrease in reflectance, indicating clearer water.
