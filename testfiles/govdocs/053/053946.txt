Dear Sir,

  In response to the enclosed article from USA Today, I believe that companies should be held
to the EXACT meaning of their words.  For example:
  Made in U.S.A. MEANS that all materials and parts are made in, and assembled in the United
  States.

  Anything else should have to read - Assembled in
  U.S.A. from imported materials (or parts).  OR
  Assembled in East.  Jabip from American parts,
  OR Made in Japan from American steel,
  OR exactly whatever is necessary to give the consumer the clarity we deserve.  And we do
  deserve that clarity.
  We have the right. to support - or not to support any country's economy for personal
reasons.  The only way for citizen-consumers to do this is by having direct and easy access to
information which is now being withheld.  If companies want the marketing tool of being able to
say "Made in the U.S.A.", let them earn it by supporting the manufacturing base.
  Thanks for hearing me!
                           Yours truly,
                          Leslie Eberman
