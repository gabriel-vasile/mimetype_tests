SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 I. Background

     Under section 406(b) of FDAMA, the agency is required to consult
with its external stakeholders, specifically ``appropriate scientific
and academic experts, health care professionals, representatives of
patient and consumer advocacy groups, and the regulated industry.''
Following these consultations, FDA is to develop and publish a plan for
achieving compliance with each of its obligations under the act.
    Under section 406(b) of FDAMA, the plan, which must be published in
the Federal Register by November 21, 1998, should address, but may not
be confined to, the following six objectives: (1) Maximizing the
availability and clarity of information about the agency application
and submission review processes; (2) maximizing the availability and
clarity of information for consumers and patients concerning new
products; (3) implementing inspection and postmarket monitoring
provisions of the act; (4) assuring access to the scientific and
technical expertise needed to carry out FDA's obligations; (5)
establishing mechanisms, by July 1, 1999, for meeting specified time
periods for the review of applications and submissions; and (6)
eliminating backlogs in the review of applications and submissions.

[[Page 39878]]

    To help focus comments, FDA requests that oral and/or written views
regarding how the agency can best meet these six objectives of its
modernization plan address seven questions. An information packet,
available on the FDA webpage or from the designated contact persons
listed in section III of this document, provides substantive background
information; it is highly recommended that those individuals or groups
who wish to make a presentation or submit written comments obtain this
packet. Specific questions relate to each objective as follows:
    1. What can FDA do to improve its explanation of the agency's
submission review processes, and make explanations more available to
product sponsors and other interested parties?
    2. How can the agency maximize the availability and clarity of
information concerning new products?
    3. How can FDA work with its partners to ensure that products--both
domestic and foreign--produced and marketed by the regulated industry
are of high quality and provide necessary consumer protection; and how
can FDA best establish and sustain an effective, timely, and science-
based postmarketing surveillance system for reporting, monitoring,
evaluating, and correcting problems associated with use/consumption of
FDA-regulated products?
    4. What approach should FDA use to assure an appropriate scientific
infrastructure, with continued access to the scientific and technical
expertise needed to meet its statutory obligations and strengthen its
science-based decisionmaking process?
    5. What do you believe FDA should do to adequately meet the demands
that are beginning to burden the application review process, especially
for non-user fee products, so that it can meet its statutory
obligations to achieve timely product reviews?
    6. What suggestions do you have for the agency to eliminate
backlogs in the review process?
    7. What other objectives related to the agency's statutory
obligations or public expectations--beyond the six objectives--should
be included in the FDA plan?

II. Comments

    Written comments should be identified with the docket number found
in brackets in the heading of this document and should be submitted by
September 11, 1998, to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food
and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD
20852. Comments can be sent to the Dockets Management Branch at the
