This message is resent to clarify that the AFEP houses the ingestors not
the preprocessors. This is for clarity only and of little or no concern
to 1B data users.



Topic:
    Testing 1B data generated from the new Advanced Front End
Preprocessor

Date/Time(UTC) Message Issued:
    15 October 2004, 1450 UTC

Satellite(s) Involved:
     NOAA-14, NOAA-16, and NOAA-17

Instrument(s) Involved:
     All instruments

Product(s) Involved/Affected:
    No impact to operational data

Date/Time(UTC) of Initial Implementation:
      TBA

Details/Specifics of Change:

1B test data will be made available on 18 October 2004 via website. This
data is to be used to evaluate the data generated from the Advanced
Front End Preprocessor (AFEP). The current preprocessor will be replaced
by the AFEP as the operational preprocessor. This is scheduled to occur
on/or shortly after 17 November 2004. We would appreciate any feedback
concerning the test data. The test data will be made available during
the period between 18 October and November 17 2004. I will send out an
announcement of the first orbit for the test data, and the website
location on 18 October 2004. Please let this serve as notification of
this testing and be advised that a new preprocessor is scheduled to go
into operations on/or shortly after
17 November 2004. Your evaluation of this data is essential in that the
AFEP will become the operational preprocessor. We have evaluated the
AFEP inhouse for an extended period and do not anticipate any problems,
nevertheless your feedback is important to us. The data will be
generated in parallel with operational data.
