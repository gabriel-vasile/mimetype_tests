Description
     Abstract: 
	  These data consist of retrospective ocean turbidity images from the
	  period around the landfall of hurricane Andrew.  This imagery was derived
	  from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) aboard the NOAA
	  series polar-orbiting satellites and covers the coastal areas of the Gulf
	  of Mexico and Florida.  4 unique turbidity images are included on the
	  CD-ROM during the time period surrounding Andrew's landfall from July 31 
	  to August 31, 1992. Image resolution is 1.3 km.
     Purpose: 
	  The purpose of these data is to provide simplified, rapid access to 
	  images depicting the conditions of turbidity before and after hurricane
	  Andrew.  These images can assist and inform marine scientists and coastal
	  resource managers of hurricane induced changes in the overall water
	  clarity.
     Supplemental_Information: 
	  The original hurricane turbidity imagery was cropped, georeferenced,
	  navigated and registered to a continental outline (vector).  Subsequently
	  it was processed to add a landmask, reflectance scale, and annotation. 
	  The data imagery is contained in a GEOTIFF image graphics file format.  
	  The "before", "after" and "difference" views are available as JPEG image 
	  graphics files as well. The "difference" images show the change in 
	  turbidity derived from the "before" and "after" images. Also available on 
	  the CD-ROM is a freeware version of PCI Handler (one compiled and one 
	  compressed) for viewing the GEOTIFF images.  The inclusion of any 
	  software does not imply endorsement.

Data_Quality_Information
     Attribute_Accuracy
          Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
	       The accuracy of the reflectance data is currently unknown.
     Logical_Consistency_Report:  
	  Post processing analysis indicated all image files contained turbidity 
	  data and were consistently geo-located through hand navigation and 
	  registration to within one pixel (~ 1 km).
     Completeness_Report:  
	  Images in this data set were chosen based on being relatively cloud free 
	  and having good registration accuracy.  A total of 23 images were
	  processed with 4 selected for inclusion on the CD-ROM based on the above 
	  criteria.  Also included is a "difference" image derived from the 
	  "before" and "after" images, highlighting changes in turbidity which 
	  resulted from hurricane Andrew.
     Positional_Accuracy
	  Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
	       The grid size for all the images is 1000x650 pixels.

	       Process_Description:  
		    The USGS program AVHRRMAP7 was used to produce turbidity maps 
		    from the AVHRR data in level 1b format.  The image data were 
		    scaled into a turbidity range of 0 to 12.7 percent water
		    reflectance (8 bit).  Each image was cropped for the specific
		    viewing area and then hand navigated to a continental outline 
		    of the coast.  A raster landmask, the hurricane ground track, 
		    text annotation and the turbidity scale (color bar) were 
	  	    "burned" into each image.  Images were converted to JPEG and 
		    TIFF format.  The raster cell (pixel) values in the JPEG image
		    are radiometrically meaningless.  The colors in the image are
		    representative of turbidity only as they relate to the 
		    turbidity scale values.  The pixel values in the TIFF images 
		    are radiometrically correct.  As one byte integers they 
		    represent turbidity counts from 0-255 that encompass a 
	 	    turbidity range of 0 to 12.7 percent (i.e.,
		    %refdiff = (DN-1)/20 ).  Land is always represented as value 
		    254 (gray) and coastline and state boundaries as 0 (black). 
		    Areas of no data are also represented as value 0 while clouds
		    are represented by value 255 (white). In the "difference" 
		    images the coastline is represented as 255.
