LOWER AND UPPER PAGING BANDS AUCTION
CORRECTION OF LABELING FOR LICENSES IN THE 152 MHz AND 158 
MHz LOWER BANDS UNPAIRED PAGING CHANNELS 

Report No. AUC-01-40-D (Auction No. 40)

This Public Notice corrects the heading on a table listing licenses available in Auction No. 
40.  The Auction No.40 Procedures Public Notice  includes tables listing the various licenses 
available in Auction No. 40.  The table on page 3 labeled "152 MHz Lower Bands Unpaired 
Paging Channels" includes licenses for blocks EA (152.230 - 152.250 MHz), EB (152.830 - 
152.850 MHz), EC (158.090 - 158.110 MHz), and ED (158.690 - 158.710 MHz).  The heading 
on that table is corrected to read "152 MHz and 158 MHz Lower Bands Unpaired Paging 
Channels."  A revised copy of the 152 MHz and 158MHz Lower Bands Unpaired Paging 
Channels table is provided in Attachment A.

This Public Notice also announces changes in the computer interface applicants use when 
selecting licenses in connection with their FCC Form 175.  For Auction No. 40, Form 175 
includes a mechanism for applicants to search for licenses by "Service Area."  Originally, licenses 
included in the 152 MHz and 158 MHz Lower Bands Unpaired Paging Channels table could be 
found by searching under "152 MHz Unpaired."  For clarity, effective immediately, the Bureau 
will change the "Service Area" designation for licenses in the 152 MHz and 158 MHz Lower 
Bands Unpaired Paging Channels from "152 MHz Unpaired" to "152 MHz and 158 MHz 
Unpaired."

After an applicant searches for licenses, individual licenses are listed with a "bandwidth" 
designation.  Originally, all licenses in the 152 MHz and 158 MHz Lower Bands Unpaired Paging 
Channels were listed with a "bandwidth" designation of "152.00 MHz."  For clarity, effective 
immediately, the Bureau will change the "bandwidth" designation for individual licenses in 
blocks EC and ED from "152.00 MHz" to "158.00 MHz."  The "bandwidth" designation for 
blocks EA and EB will remain "152.00 MHz."

The above changes do not change in any manner the licenses available in Auction No. 40 
or listed in the Auction No. 40 Procedures Public Notice.
