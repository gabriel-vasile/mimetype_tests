Dear U.S.  TTB,

Today, more than ever, I have information readily available to me about the contents of what I eat and drink. Every can of soup, box of cereal and carton of milk has the nutritional information that helps me make healthy and informed decisions about what I consume.

That is, everything except beverage alcohol. Why is that?

This information is important to me, and I am writing today to request that you allow alcohol companies to include basic information like serving size, alcohol per serving, protein and calories on their packages. 

I urge you to help make that information more readily available to consumers. There is no valid reason not to.

If consumers want this information and the companies that make the products want to provide it, simple common sense says it should happen - now. Please allow beverage alcohol companies to put basic nutritional information on their packages.

Thank you very much for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Mark Sprinkle
