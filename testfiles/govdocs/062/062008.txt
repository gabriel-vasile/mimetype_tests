A COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE TRI-STATE BY MID                  
EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FROM THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH              
TUESDAY EVENING...THEN MOVES TO THE WATERS OFF THE MID ATLANTIC                 
COAST WEDNESDAY. A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE                   
NORTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND PUSH THROUGH THE REGION THURSDAY. THE               
FRONT WILL STALL OUT TO OUR SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN LIFT BACK               
NORTH THROUGH THE TRI-STATE AS A WARM FRONT ON FRIDAY. THE FRONT                
WILL THEN STALL OUT TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA...AS HIGH                 
PRESSURE REMAINS OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH                   
SUNDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY PUSH THROUGH THE TRI- STATE FROM               
THE WEST SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...                                      
OTHER THAN A TRACE FROM SPRINKLES THIS MORNING...THE COLD FRONT                 
THAT CURRENTLY STRETCHES FROM N CENTRAL CT TO ROCKLAND COUNTY...BACK            
INTO CENTRAL PA AT 19Z...WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION DRY BY MID                
EVENING. 18Z RUC SHOWS THETA-E RIDGE RETREATING RAPIDLY TO THE SW               
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AS DRY AIR WORKS ITS WAY DOWN FROM ALOFT AS                
THE 850 COLD FRONT WAS ALREADY S OF LONG ISLAND BY 18Z...ALSO                   
EFFECTIVELY MINIMIZE THE EXTENT OF ANY LIFT GENERATED BY THE                    
SURFACE FRONT TO AROUND 5000 FT...NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT ANY                 
MEANINGFUL CONVECTION. WHILE A STRAY SPRINKLE WITH ITS PASSAGE                  
CANNOT COMPLETELY BE RULED OUT...THE PROBABILITY OF A SPRINKLE AT               
ANY ONE PLACE IS AT BEST 10 PCT...AND THE CHANCE OF MEASURABLE                  
PRECIPITATION EVEN LESS THAN THAT.                                              
SKY CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE FAIRLY RAPIDLY AFTER FRONTAL                      
PASSAGE. WITH CLEAR SKY CONDITIONS BY AROUND MIDNIGHT (AT THE                   
LATEST) AND LIGHT WINDS AFTER MIDNIGHT...WILL END UP WITH GOOD                  
RADIATIONAL COOLING FOR THE LATTER 1/2 OF THE NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR              
LOWS TO FALL TO NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL READINGS (EXCEPT IN               
THE NYC HEAT ISLAND WHERE LOWS WILL STILL BE 4-5 DEGREES ABOVE                  
NORMAL)...AND FOR DEWPOINTS TO FALL INTO THE 40S...MAKING TONIGHT               
MUCH LESS HUMID THAN LAST NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY/...                          
NAM AND GFS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR IN THE SHORT TERM...FOLLOWED A                   
BLEND THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...THEN FOLLOWED THE NAM WITH THE                
BACKDOOR FRONT (NAM HISTORICALLY HANDLES BACK DOOR FRONTS BETTER                
THAN THE GFS).                                                                  
RIDGING BUILDS IN AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT THROUGH WEDNESDAY                    
MORNING...THEN ALL RIDGE AXES MOVE OFFSHORE BY WEDNESDAY EVENING.               
THIS ALLOWS FOR CONFLUENT FLOW TO SET UP OVER THE NORTHERN NEW                  
ENGLAND/SOUTHERN CANADA IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS...SUPPORTING                 
THE BUILDING OF HIGH PRESSURE INTO THAT REGION THURSDAY...PUSHING               
A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT THROUGH US TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST BY                      
THURSDAY EVENING.                                                               
THE RESULT WILL BE DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH                  
HIGH TEMPERATURES INCREASING FROM AROUND 5 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ON              
TUESDAY TO AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL WEDNESDAY (AWAY FROM THE              
COAST/LONG ISLAND WHERE A SEA BREEZE WILL LIMIT HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY              
TO NEAR TUESDAYS LEVELS). LOWS WILL GENERALLY RUN 2-5 DEGREES                   
ABOVE NORMAL TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.                                       
TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY ARE TRICKY...TOTALLY DEPENDANT ON THE                  
TIMING OF THE PASSAGE OF THE BACK DOOR FRONT. IF IT DOES NOT PUSH               
THROUGH UNTIL MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...INLAND/NYC HEAT ISLAND                    
LOCATIONS COULD SEE HIGHS WELL INTO THE 80S...WITH COASTAL/LONG                 
ISLAND LOCATIONS GENERALLY 75 TO 80. IF THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH                
DURING THE MORNING...COASTAL/LONG ISLAND LOCATIONS WILL STRUGGLE                
TO GET OUT OF THE MID 60S (WATER TEMPERATURES RUNNING MID 50S TO                
LOWER 60S)...WHILE INLAND LOCATIONS WON/T GET MUCH PAST THE MID                 
70S. FOR NOW HAVE PLAYED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES WITH                
AREAS N/W OF NYC GETTING INTO THE LOWER 80S...METRO NYC/INTERIOR                
PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN 1/2 OF OUR CWA GETTING TO AROUND 80...MOST              
OF WESTERN/CENTRAL LONG ISLAND AND COASTAL WESTERN AND INTERIOR                 
EASTERN CT GETTING TO THE MID 70S...AND EASTERN CT/LONG ISLAND                  
GETTING TO 65-70. HAVE PLACED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NE PORTIONS THU                
MORNING FOR SHOWERS...THEN CHC POPS ALL BUT FAR SW THU AFTERNOON                
FOR SHRA/TSRA. CLOUD COVER SHOULD RAPIDLY INCREASE AND                          
TEMPERATURES FAIRLY RAPIDLY FALL BEHIND THE FRONT...ESPECIALLY                  
WITH AN AFTERNOON FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...                                   
BACK DOOR FRONT STALLS OUT TO OUR SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT (LIKELY                  
WITH LOW CLOUDS AND LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE) THEN LIFTS TO THE NORTH                 
BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON (FOR NOW USED GFS TIMING TO CLEAR FRONT TO THE              
NORTH). QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE EXTENDED WITH NO REAL                 
CLEAR SIGNAL FROM ANY ONE MODEL OR ENSEMBLE OF MODELS. FOR NOW IT               
APPEARS THE BACKDOOR FRONT WILL STALL OUT TO THE NORTH AND EAST                 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...THOUGH THERE IS SOME INDICATIONS THE                 
FRONT COULD SINK BACK TO OUR SOUTH COME LATE SATURDAY. ANOTHER                  
UNCERTAINTY IS HOW QUICKLY THE MIDWEST CUTOFF MOVES                             
EASTWARD...BRINGING ITS COLD FRONT EASTWARD WITH IT...AND FINALLY               
THE EVOLUTION OF ANY TROPICAL MOISTURE/SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY/SUNDAY.              
FOR NOW HAVE LEANED TOWARDS THE 0Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN...WHICH                    
KEEPS THE BACK DOOR FRONT TO THE NORTH AND BRINGS THE COLD FRONT                
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY...AND DOES NOT REFLECT ANY DEVELOPMENT              
IN THE GULF (NO CLEAR SIGNAL FROM ALL ITS MEMBERS).

VFR. COULD SEE AN ISOLATED SHOWER AHEAD OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT               
BEFORE 00Z...ONLY WORTH MENTION OF TEMPO BROKEN VFR CIGS ATTM.                  
WINDS HAVE SHIFTED W-NW 10-15 KT AT KHPN/KSWF...BUT ARE STILL VARYING           
ROUGHLY BETWEEN 240-290 AT KTEB/KEWR...WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS A                  
LITTLE OVER 15 KT. THIS MAY CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE FOR AT LEAST A              
COUPLE MORE HOURS UNTIL THE FRONT GETS CLOSER TO THE TERMINALS.                 
SEA BREEZE REGIME IS IN PLACE AT COASTAL TERMINALS...INCLUDING KLGA             
WHICH WAS JUST ON THE EDGE PER JFK TERMINAL DOPPLER RADAR...WITH SW             
FLOW 10-15 KT. WINDS AT ALL TERMINALS SHOULD SHIFT NW THIS EVENING              
WITH COLD FROPA...ABOUT 23Z AT COASTAL CT TERMINALS AND 00Z NYC AREA

GIVE US A VALUE OF 3.3 WHICH IS CONSIDERED IN THE MINOR EVENT RANGE             
SHOULD CONVECTION DEVELOP.                                                      
HOWEVER...THE OVERALL WIND FIELD IS NOT REALLY FAVORABLE FOR ANY                
SEVERE DEVELOPMENT...AS THE NOSE OF THE H850 (ONLY ABOUT 30 KTS)                
DOES NOT LINE UP WITH ANY DIVERGENCE ALOFT AS THE LF QUAD OF THE                
UPPER JET REMAINS WELL NORTH. THERE IS ONLY VERY LIMITED SPEED SHEAR            
IN THE COLUMN. EITHER WAY...THE THREAT FROM SEVERE IS WAY TOO LOW TO            
INCLUDE IN OUTLOOK. ONE THING OF NOTE IS THAT THE WET-BULB ZERO                 
LOOKS TO FALL TO ABOUT 8KFT AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. THIS VALUE IS A              
BIT LOW FOR FOR THE FORMATION OF LARGE HAIL STONES...BUT COULD REAP             
SMALL ONES. HOWEVER...AGAIN SINCE THE THREAT OF STORMS IS SO LOW TO             
BEGIN WITH...AT THIS POINT FEEL NO NEED TO PLACE ANY MENTION OF                 
ENHANCED WORDING OF ANY KIND IN ANY OF THE SOUTHEASTERN ZONES.                  
BY TONIGHT...DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR WILL HAVE INFILTRATED THE            
SCENE AS THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS BUILDING IN. THE               
SKY WILL CLEAR AND FINE LATE SPRING WEATHER WILL SETTLE INTO THE

INTO THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK INTO NEXT WEEKEND...BUT THE OVERALL            
AGREEMENT IS FOR UNSETTLED WEATHER WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES.              
STRONG RIDGING WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE WEST COAST BY MID WEEK WITH A             
TROUGH DIGGING ACROSS THE PLAINS AND HEADING EASTWARD. THE EASTERN              
UNITED STATES WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DEEP MID LEVEL TROUGH

IS WELL EAST OF THE CWA...STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SHOWERS TO               
DEVELOP UNTIL FROPA THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.  SO THIS WILL KEEP THE

07Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS CONTINUE TO SHOW UPPER RIDGING              
FROM THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. THE            
NORTHERN STREAM FLOW IS RATHER ZONAL IN NATURE AT THIS TIME RUNNING             
ALONG THE NORTHER TIER OF STATES. TWO FAIRLY POTENT SHORTWAVES ARE              
SEEN EMBEDDED WITH THE FLOW OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND ANOTHER              
EXITING THE GREAT LAKES TOWARD THE NORTHEAST U.S AND CANADIAN                   
MARITIMES. FURTHER SOUTH IN THE UPSTREAM FLOW FROM OUR FORECAST AREA            
WE SEE A BROAD UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...THIS TROUGH            
WILL SLOWLY PUSH EAST THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND MAY FINALLY             
BRING THE CHANCE FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS TO OUR DROUGHT                      
STRICKEN REGION BY THE MID/LATE WEEK PERIOD.                                    
LITTLE CHANGE IS SEEN AT THE SURFACE WITH HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING              
TO NOSE BACK OFF THE ATLANTIC INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. OUR                 
FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN EASTERLY FLOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THIS                
RIDGE. 28/00Z KTLH SOUNDING FROM LAST EVENING ONCE AGAIN SHOWED VERY            
IMPRESSIVE DIURNAL MIXING UP TO 8KFT+. THE SUPPRESSING EFFECTS OF               
THE UPPER RIDGE ARE ALSO STILL SEEN WITH A HEALTHY WARM LAYER CAP IN            
THE MID LEVELS AND NO LACK OF DRY AIR THROUGH ALMOST THE ENTIRE                 
COLUMN.                                                                         
AREAS ACROSS SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH-CENTRAL GEORGIA ENDURED ANOTHER DAY            
OF SMOKE ON SUNDAY WITH THE PLUME MIGRATING WEST AND NORTHWEST WITH             
THE FLOW. GENERALLY THIS PLUME STAYED TO THE NORTH OF OUR FLORIDA               
ZONES YESTERDAY AND A SIMILAR SCENARIO IS ANTICIPATED ON MONDAY.                
&&                                                                              
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WED.                                                
ONE MORE DAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER RIDGE FOR THE FORECAST            
AREA. SURFACE RIDGING CENTERED OFF THE CAROLINA COAST WILL ALSO                 
CONTINUE TO DOMINATE WITH REGION WITH A DRY EASTERLY FLOW. THE TIGHT            
GRADIENT ALONG THE SOUTH EDGE OF THIS RIDGE CURRENTLY WILL RELAX A              
BIT BY AFTERNOON WHICH SHOULD ALLOW HEALTHY SEA-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS             
TO DEVELOP. AREAS DOWNWIND OF THE GEORGIA WILDFIRES (MAINLY                     
SOUTH-CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST GEORGIA) SHOULD PREPARE FOR ANOTHER DAY             
OF SMOKE/HAZE WITH THE THICKEST SMOKE AND LOWEST VISIBILITIES STILL             
AROUND AND TO THE NORTH OF VALDOSTA IN CLOSEST PROXIMITY TO THE                 
FIRES. TODAY SHOULD SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE RETURN OF SOME                     
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. THIS WILL ESPECIALLY BE TRUE IN THE WEST WITH               
AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS A BIT HIGHER THAN OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND MAKING             
IT FEEL MORE LIKE LATE MAY OUTSIDE. THE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL            
STILL HAVE ENOUGH INFLUENCE TO KEEP CONVECTION SUPPRESSED. CAN NOT              
RULE OUT AN ISOLATED SHOWER LATE THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FLORIDA              
PANHANDLE ALONG THE SEA-BREEZE...HOWEVER FEEL ANY COVERAGE WILL BE              
VERY ISOLATED IN NATURE KEEPING POPS IN THE SILENT 5-10% RANGE. AS              
HAS BEEN THE SITUATION DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL EXPECT A RATHER            
HEALTHY CU FIELD TO DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING              
WITH SCT-BKN CLOUDS AROUND 6-7KFT. MIXING FORECAST SOUNDINGS DOWN               
FROM AROUND 7KFT THIS AFTERNOON GIVES AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES               
GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 80S ACROSS INLAND AREAS. CLOSER TO THE COAST             
WILL SEE TEMPS REACH THE MIDDLE 80S BEFORE SEA-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS              
DEVELOP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON KEEPING TEMPERATURES IN CHECK.                   
UPPER TROUGH MENTIONED ABOVE BEGINS TO SLIDE ALONG THE GULF COAST               
TONIGHT. GFS/NAM BOTH SHOWING WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY EMBEDDED WITHIN             
THE TROUGH OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL GOMEX WITH SHOWER COVERAGE                    
INCREASING TO OUR WEST. FEEL THAT THE MOISTURE SHOWN BY THE MODELS              
IS A BIT OVERDONE AND QUICK TO COME EAST...BUT WILL INTRODUCE A                 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP OVER THE WESTERN COASTAL WATERS LATE TONIGHT AND              
TUESDAY MORNING. KEEPING POPS OFFSHORE FOR NOW...BUT WILL BE A CLOSE            
CALL FOR PLACES LIKE WALTON AND BAY COUNTIES AND POPS MAY NEED TO BE            
EXPANDED INTO THESE AREAS LATER TODAY. EITHER WAY MID/HIGH LEVEL                
CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST HELPING KEEP                   
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY IN THE MIDDLE 60S ACROSS THE REGION.                     
BROAD UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO SIT ACROSS THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL              
GULF COAST TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. ALTHOUGH THE TROUGH AXIS DOES NOT            
MOVE MUCH...THE GFS SHOWS SEVERAL PIECES OF SHORTWAVE ENERGY                    
EJECTING EASTWARD INTO OUR GENERAL VICINITY. THESE PIECES OF ENERGY             
ARE LIKELY OVERDONE. HOWEVER...THE SHEAR FACT THAT THE UPPER RIDGE              
IS CONTINUING TO BREAK DOWN AND LOW/MID LEVEL MOISTURE IS ON THE                
RISE AS THE SURFACE RIDGE RETREATS SLOWLY NORTHEAST IS ENOUGH TO                
FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT RE-INTRODUCE POPS...MAINLY TO SOUTHERN AND                 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE COUNTY WARNING AREA.  WILL GENERALLY KEEP               
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW END CHANCE POPS (20-30%) BOTH DAYS WITH                    
CONVECTION STILL WIDELY SCATTERED IN NATURE. BEST CHANCES AS                    
MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BE ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA...                  
ESPECIALLY THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...WHERE SEA-BREEZE CONVERGENCE WILL            
HAVE EVEN LESS SUPPRESSION FROM ABOVE. FURTHER NORTH AND EAST ACROSS            
A GOOD CHUNK OF OUR GEORGIA ZONES AND DOWN INTO PORTIONS OF THE                 
EASTERN BIG BEND WILL KEEP POPS STILL IN THE SILENT 5-10% RANGE AS              
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY BE BE LACKING AND THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL              
STILL BE IN FAIRLY CLOSE PROXIMITY.                                             
.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SUN.                                              
STILL SOME QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE EXACT PATTERN EVOLUTION INTO             
THE LATER PART OF THE WORKWEEK AND NEXT WEEKEND...ESPECIALLY IN                 
TERMS OF SURFACE PATTERN. BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST. THURSDAY WILL                 
STILL SEE THE BROAD UPPER TROUGH AXIS TO OUR WEST BUT TRYING TO MAKE            
ITS WAY TOWARD THE CENTRAL GULF COAST. A MORE SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW                
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE MOISTURE TO THE REGION AND WITH THE HELP              
OF THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS HAVE AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALMOST             
REGIONWIDE FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON. ONLY PLACE THAT STILL LOOKS                  
UNLIKELY TO SEE ANY CONVECTION IS ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL GA WHERE                 
MOISTURE MAY STILL BE LACKING. BY LATE FRIDAY THE UPPER PATTERN                 
ACROSS THE CONUS IS BECOMING VERY AMPLIFIED FOR EARLY JUNE WITH A               
LARGE RIDGE ALONG THE WEST COAST AND A DEEPENING TROUGH ACROSS THE              
NATIONS MID-SECTION. THE PATTERN ONLY CONTINUES TO AMPLIFY THROUGH              
THE WEEKEND WITH A VERY DEEP TROUGH FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE                 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES BY SUNDAY. LARGE SCALE CYCLONIC FLOW OVERHEAD               
WILL AID CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND HAVE WIDESPREAD CHANCE              
POPS FOR ALL ZONES SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY.                                        
TEMPERATURES WILL BE RATHER TRICKY THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THE             
COLUMNS POTENTIAL WILL BE RATHER WARM BUT WITH THE UNSETTLED UPPER              
LEVELS THERE MAY BE TIMES OF SUBSTANTIAL CLOUD COVER. WITH THIS IN              
MIND RAN TEMPERATURES NEAR CLIMO. HOWEVER...TEMPERATURES SEVERAL                
DEGREES WARMER ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE ANY DAY IF SIGNIFICANT                    
SUNSHINE OCCURS.                                                                
WAS HOPING THAT THE GLOBAL MODELS WOULD COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT              
WITH REGARDS TO A POSSIBLE SYSTEM COMING OUT OF THE WESTERN                     
CARRIBEAN INTO THE EASTERN GOMEX DURING THE END OF THE WEEK AND                 
FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. UNFORTUNATELY THE GUIDANCE REMAINS SPLIT.            
THE GFS IS SHOWING A RATHER WEAK WAVE MOVING UP WITH JUST AN                    
INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WHILE THE ECMWF AND UKMET DEVELOP THE            
SYSTEM A BIT MORE BRINGING A CLOSED LOW INTO THE SOUTHEAST                      
GULF ON SATURDAY...THEN CROSSING THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THE CANADIAN            
WHICH HAS BEEN BULLISH WITH THIS SYSTEM ALL ALONG IS SHOWING THE                
CLOSED LOW MOVING NORTH THROUGH THE EASTERN GOMEX INTO OUR AREA.                
WITH AS MUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THERE IS AT THIS TIME...HAVE RAN THE                
FORECAST CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION AS IS SUGGESTED BY HPC WHILE                
WAITING FOR BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IT APPEARS             
AS THOUGH THERE WILL FINALLY BE A CHANCE FOR SOME LOCALLY BENEFICIAL            
RAIN BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

COASTAL WATERS WILL REMAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF SURFACE HIGH                    
PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR THE CAROLINA COAST THROUGH MUCH OF THE                   
FORECAST PERIOD. THIS WILL KEEP THE FLOW FROM THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST            
THROUGH AT LEAST MIDWEEK. EXPECT WINDS TO COME UP TO CAUTION LEVELS             
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE OFFSHORE WATERS EACH NIGHT THROUGH MIDWEEK                
THEN DROP BELOW CAUTION EACH MORNING. AS AN UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM                  
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD THE CHANCE FOR              
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO INCREASE ACROSS THE

UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO DEFLECT MOISTURE IN THE WESTERLIES AWAY                
FROM GEORGIA. BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...IT LOOKS LIKE BANDS OF               
HIGH CIRRUS WILL AFFECT NORTHERN AND WESTERN COUNTIES MORE THAN                 
CENTRAL AND EAST OVERNIGHT. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES            
ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL GEORGIA. OVERNIGHT MIN TEMPERATURES LOOK TO              
BE ON TRACK BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND 00Z SOUNDING. THE SOUNDING               
AND VAD WINDS AT 00Z SHOW THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW PERSISTING. A              
SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE SOUTHERLY COMPONENT IS FORECAST BY THE RUC               
TOWARD MORNING. THIS SHOULD BRING AREAS OF SMOKE FARTHER NORTH                  
WEDNESDAY...PROBABLY AFFECTING COLUMBUS ALONG WITH AMERICUS AND                 
VIDALIA.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...                                 
LARGE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES ITS HOLD OVER THE SOUTHEAST. ENOUGH                 
MOISTURE IS WORKING ITS WAY IN THE SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE                      
ATLANTIC TO PROVIDE FOR SOME AFTERNOON CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT...BUT                
SAVE FOR OROGRAPHIC LIFT ALONG THE MOUNTAINS...THE SUBSIDENT HIGH               
PRESSURE IS NOT ALLOWING FOR ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THIS                   
SHOULD CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS ANY SIGNIFICANT                  
MOISTURE FEED FROM THE GULF CONTINUES TO MOVE INTO THE PLAINS AND               
BE SHUNTED OVER THE RIDGE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES.                 
THE WAVE CURRENTLY OVER THE TEXAS/OKLAHOMA AREA WILL ALSO BE                    
LOFTED OVER THE RIDGE AND EVENTUALLY SWALLOWED BY THE LARGER UPPER              
LOW WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE NORTHWESTERN STATES CURRENTLY AS                
PER THIS MORNING`S 12Z UA ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE GFS STILL HAS ITS              
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK ISSUES...IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN YESTERDAY AND               
GIVEN TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IT AND THE NAM...THE GFS IS THE                
MODEL OF CHOICE FOR THE SHORT TERM (ALTHOUGH GIVEN HOW LITTLE IS                
HAPPENING OVER THIS AREA IT REALLY DOESN`T MATTER ALL THAT MUCH).               
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT A WEAKNESS WILL DEVELOP IN THE UPPER                 
FIELD LATE THURSDAY AND BOTH THE NAM AND GFS ARE BRINGING PRECIP                
TO THE GEORGIA MOUNTAINS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AND                   
INCONSISTENCY OF LATE...HAVE OPTED NOT TO ADD POPS AND WILL WAIT                
FOR MORE CONFIDENCE BEFORE PUTTING PRECIP IN THE FORECAST.                      
.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...                                          
ECMWF/GFS/UKMET/DGEX ALL INDICATE A PATTERN CHANGE IN THE WORKS                 
TOWARD THE WEEKEND AND INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...                       
TRANSITIONING INTO GENERAL TROUGHINESS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE             
COUNTRY...BEGINNING WITH THIS UPPER LOW THAT IS MOVING INTO THE                 
NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE COUNTRY NOW. IT IS SUPPOSED TO WRAP UP                 
AND KICK THIS UPPER HIGH OUT...AND IN DOING SO SHOULD BRING MORE                
MOISTURE WITH IT AND COOLER TEMPERATURES FOR NEXT WEEK.                         
HOWEVER...TIMING IS THE QUESTION BECAUSE YET AGAIN THE WEAK                     
FRONTAL PASSAGE HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK ON THE GFS...BUT WITH THE                  
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS THERE MAY STILL BE PRECIP LATE IN                
THE WEEKEND VERSUS EARLY NEXT WEEK.                                             
THE OTHER INTERESTING FEATURE IS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING               
IN THE EASTERN GULF THAT CROSSES THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND DEEPENS              
IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...THIS IS INDICATED ON BOTH THE GFS AND                 
THE ECMWF FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. WILL MONITOR TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS                 
WITH IT...COULD JUST BE AN OUTLIER BUT SINCE BOTH MODELS HAVE                   
IT...IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINING STATIONARY OVER THE NEXT 24 HRS...FROM THE              
CAROLINAS EASTWARD INTO THE ATLANTIC. SUBSIDENCE CONTINUES TO BE                
STRONG OVER GEORGIA WITH SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THIS SURFACE HIGH              
ALONG WITH RIDGING ALOFT. VERY DRY AIRMASS WILL LEAD TO DIURNALLY               
INDUCED SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON CUMULUS AGAIN TOMORROW...THOUGH              
CEILINGS WILL REMAIN WELL INTO THE VFR RANGE. WINDS GENERALLY OUT OF            
AN E/SE DIRECTION THROUGH THE PERIOD AS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE            
LARGE SCALE WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED. SMOKE IS REMAINING WELL

OF OUR TAF AIRPORTS IN THE LAST 48HRS...BUT WILL STILL NEED TO KEEP

MAIN FORECAST ISSUES WILL CONTINUE TO CENTER ON WARM TEMPERATURES               
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...AND INCREASING CHANCES FOR                             
CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY BY LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY.                        
SURFACE WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT NORTHEAST THROUGH FAR                  
NORTHEAST ILLINOIS EARLY THIS MORNING. LATEST SFC OBS INDICATING                
THIS TREND WITH SFC DEW PTS AT MDW HAVING INCREASED BY AROUND 10                
DEGREES OVER THE LAST 2 HOURS. FURTHER SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT WITH             
SFC DEW PTS IN THE MID 60S...LIGHT WINDS...AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES               
HAVE HAD SOME PATCHY FOG WITH VSBYS GENERALLY IN THE 2-4 MILE RANGE             
ACROSS MANY LOCATIONS. MAY HAVE SOME LOCALIZED DENSER FOG PATCHES               
THIS MORNING...BUT THIS SHOULD BURN OFF QUICKLY EARLY THIS MORNING.             
ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE FIRMLY IN THE WARM SECTOR THIS                 
AFTERNOON WITH 850 HPA TEMPS AROUND +15 TO +16 DEG C. MIXING DOWN               
THESE TEMPS SHOULD ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO REACH THE MID TO UPPER 80S                
WITHOUT MUCH PROBLEM TODAY. WITH SOUTH/SOUTHEAST FLOW NEAR THE LAKE             
TODAY...MAJORITY OF LAKE COOLING WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE LAKE COUNTY              
ILLINOIS SHORELINE BUT EVEN ACROSS THESE LOCATIONS HIGH TEMPS SHOULD            
REACH AROUND 80 GIVEN WARM AIRMASS OVER THE AREA.                               
FORECAST AREA REMAINS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING            
THIS MORNING...HOWEVER A FEW SHORT WAVES NOTED IN UPSTREAM PROFILER             
DATA AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WILL BE LIFTING NORTHWARD THROUGH THIS             
UPPER RIDGE AXIS TODAY. OTHER THAN THESE WEAK SHORT WAVES...NOT MUCH            
ELSE TO FOCUS CONVECTIVE CHANCES TODAY WITH MODEL TIME HEIGHT                   
SECTIONS FROM THE WRF/GFS INDICATING SYNOPTIC SCALE DOWNWARD MOTION             
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MAX TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S AND              
SFC DEW PTS MIXING BACK DOWN TO AROUND 60 THIS AFTERNOON...FORECAST             
SOUNDINGS YIELD AROUND 200-400 J/KG OF MLCAPE TODAY. CANNOT                     
COMPLETELY RULE OUT ISOLD SHOWER OR TSTORM TODAY BUT GIVEN WEAK                 
SUPPORT AND PASSAGE OF ONLY WEAK SHORT WAVES THROUGH THE                        
RIDGE...WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY. ONE THING THAT MAY NEED TO BE                   
WATCHED IS IF WEAK MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AXIS WEST OF THE LAKE                   
MICHIGAN SHORELINE MAY BE ENOUGH TO FOCUS ISOLD SHOWERS/TSTORMS BUT             
AGAIN CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE A MENTION.                          
FOR TONIGHT MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL SLOWLY SHIFT                        
EASTWARD ALLOWING FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL MOISTURE TRANSPORT ESPECIALLY            
ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. SEVERAL WEAK SHORT                
WAVES ALSO ARE EXPECTED TO LIFT NORTHWARD AND FROM UPPER LEVEL SHORT            
WAVE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TEXAS...BUT THIS FORCING WILL NOT LIKELY                  
ARRIVE INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY SO WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP TUESDAY NIGHT              
DRY. ON WEDNESDAY...WEAK UPPER JET STREAK ASSOCIATED WITH EASTERN TX            
WAVE WILL LIFT INTO THE MID/UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...AND WITH MORE               
IMPRESSIVE MOISTURE PROFILES ACROSS THE WEST WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE               
POPS FOR TSRA ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL ILLINOIS ON WEDNESDAY                        
AFTERNOON...AND SPREAD THIS CHANCE POPS ACROSS REMAINDER OF CWA                 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS FAR ENOUGH EASTWARD.                       
FOCUS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND WILL BE ON EVOLUTION OF LARGE            
SCALE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CONUS. 00Z RUNS HAVE                    
CONTINUED TREND OF SLOWING PROGRESSION OF THIS FEATURE WITH CANADIAN            
SOLUTION THE SLOWEST OF THESE SOLUTIONS...AND LATTER PERIODS OF THE             
WRF LOOKING ON THE MORE PROGRESSIVE SIDE. WILL CONTINUE WITH MIDDLE

NCEP ENSEMBLE MEANS ALTHOUGH ENSEMBLE MEANS EVEN A BIT SLOWER THAN              
OPERATIONAL GFS. PERHAPS BEST CHANCE OF THUNDER REMAINDER OF WEEK               
WILL OCCUR ON THURSDAY AS UPPER JET MAX CUTTING THROUGH BASE OF THIS            
AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW APPROACHES EASTERN IOWA/NORTHERN ILLINOIS.             
HAVE KEPT HIGH END CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME BUT MAY NEED TO NUDGE TO            
LIKELY POPS OVER NEXT FEW FORECASTS. GIVEN SLOWER TIMING TO UPPER               
LOW...HAVE EXPANDED CHANCE OF TSRA INTO SATURDAY AND NUDGED TEMPS UP            
TO NEAR 80 ON FRIDAY. REMAINDER OF EXTENDED LEFT AS IS.

WARM FRONT CONTINUES TO LIFT TO THE NORTH. 06Z MODEL GUIDANCE

SHORE WHICH WILL LIKELY ALLOW LAKE BREEZE INTO AREAS NORTH/EAST OF

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN LAKES WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE            
MID ATLANTIC REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AND OFF THE EAST COAST BY               
THURSDAY. MEANWHILE...A LOW PRESSURE TROUGH OVER THE HIGH PLAINS

MIDWEST RESULTING IN A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SOUTHERLY WINDS ACROSS               
LAKE MICHIGAN. THIS WILL ALSO PULL RELATIVELY WARM AIR NORTHWARD                
OVER THE LAKE...WHICH WILL TEND TO PRODUCE STABLE CONDITIONS OVER               
THE COLDER LAKE WATER AND LIMIT WIND SPEEDS TO THE 10 TO 15 KNOT

MIDWEST RESULTING IN A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SOUTHERLY WINDS ACROSS               
LAKE MICHIGAN. THIS WILL ALSO PULL RELATIVELY WARM AIR NORTHWARD

AT 0245Z THUNDERSTORMS INITIALLY CONFINED TO AREAS JUST NORTH OF                
OUR FORECAST AREA HAVE BEGUN TO SPREAD SOUTHWARD ALONG AN OUTFLOW               
BOUNDARY. 02Z RUC HAS A BULLSEYE OF 700 THETA-E CONVERGENCE OVER                
THE SMALL CONVECTIVE BLOB JUST TO OUR NORTH WHICH HAS PRODUCED                  
WIDESPREAD FLOODING.                                                            
FOR THE EVENING UPDATE HAVE USED THE DISTANCE SPEED TOOL WHICH                  
SHOWS A 15 MPH EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS. AS               
A RESULT HAVE UPPED THE POPS ACROSS THE NEBRASKA COUNTIES TO                    
CATEGORICAL...TAPERING TO CHANCE AS ONE MOVES SOUTH ALONG THE                   
BOUNDARY. THIS MATCHES BEAUTIFULLY WITH LBF GRIDS.                              
OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WERE TO INCREASE THE CLOUDS ACROSS THE EASTERN                
1/2 OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT TO CLOUDY AS BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE                  
INCREASES ON SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS. RUC FORECASTS SHOW NO FOG                     
FORMATION AT PRESENT TIME SO HAVE LEFT IT OUT.                                  
WILL WATCH FOR TRENDS ALONG THE LINE OF STORMS AND ADJUST AS NEED

TSRA SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE KGLD AIRPORT AND REACH THE KMCK

WATERSPOUTS OCCURRED EARLIER TODAY ACROSS OUR COASTAL WATERS                    
AND ANALYSIS INDICATES ADDITIONAL WATERSPOUTS REMAIN POSSIBLE

RADAR ESTIMATING WELL OVER 10 INCHES FALLING IN THE NORTHERN GULF.              
HOWEVER WITH CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL RAINFALL EXPECTED NEXT FEW

THEME FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS APPEARS TO BE RAIN...ESPECIALLY               
TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AREA OF RAIN/TRW ROTATING OVER THE NWRN GULF

THINKING WITH HGX THAT HOPEFULLY SUNSET WILL BRING AN END TO SOME               
OF THIS ACTIVITY...HOWEVER THE COVERAGE IS SO HIGH ATTM THAT I                  
WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS FOR TONIGHT OVER THE WRN 1/2 OF THE

HAVE GONE LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY               
AS LO/SHORTWAVE MOVES FARTHER EAST AND CENTERS ITSELF OVER THE

MOISTURE VALUES (MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW NEAR SATURATION AND PWAT VALUES           
NEAR 2 INCHES) SHOULD PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR NUMEROUS RW/TRW.                  
GFS/NAM PROG THESE FEATURES TO EITHER STALL OVER OR MOVE JUST EAST              
OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY AND HAVE RAISED POPS TO HIGH CHANCE FOR                
THEN. IF THIS TREND PLAYS OUT LATER SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO GIVE SOME               
THOUGHT TO GOING WITH A FLOOD WATCH...HAVE ELECTED TO HOLD OFF ON               
SUCH A CALL ATTM AS ANTECEDENT SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS APPEAR TO

ROCKIES WITH DOWNSTREAM RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE SE STATES N TO MI.             
A VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS OVER ERN UPPER MI. THIS WAVE PRODUCED A               
FEW SHRA/ISOLD TSRA OVER THE DOOR PENINSULA AND ACROSS NRN LAKE

OVER WRN UPPER MI WHERE MLCAPES ARE NEARING 1000J/KG. VIS SATELLITE             
IMAGERY INDICATES ERN FCST AREA REMAINS MORE STABLE DUE TO FLOW OFF             
LAKE MICHIGAN AS CU FIELD HAS SET UP W OF A LINE FROM SHOT POINT TO             
MENOMINEE. DEEP SRLY FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING MOISTURE N INTO THE

FLOW JUST W OF THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE AXIS. PINNING DOWN WHEN AND WHERE             
PCPN WILL OCCUR IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN...DEPENDING ON TIMING/LOCATION

IMAGERY...THERE DOESN`T APPEAR TO BE ANY SHORTWAVES UPSTREAM HEADED             
FOR UPPER MI TONIGHT...AND WITH NO WAA OCCURRING...THERE WILL BE NO             
ISENTROPIC ASCENT TO AID PCPN DEVELOPMENT (WAA/ISENTROPIC ZONE WILL             
BE WELL N OF LAKE SUPERIOR) SO...ONCE INSTABILITY DIMINISHES THIS               
EVENING...THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE/NO POTENTIAL FOR PCPN OVERNIGHT.               
WILL THUS CARRY CHC POPS THIS EVENING OVER THE W HALF OF UPPER MI               
AND THEN GO DRY OVERNIGHT. IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT AS MOIST AIRMASS             
LIMITS TEMP FALL. MOST LOCATIONS AWAY FROM LAKE MICHIGAN SHOULD FALL            
NO LWR THAN THE LWR 60S.                                                        
WED SHOULD BE A SIMILAR SETUP TO TODAY. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT A            
WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL PASS ACROSS OR NEAR WRN UPPER MI. OTHERWISE...              
BUILDING INSTABILITY DURING THE DAY WILL BE THE MAIN FACTOR FOR ANY             
SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT. GFS LOWERS MIXED LAYER DWPTS WED COMPARED TO             
TODAY WITH READINGS FALLING INTO THE LOW/MID 50S. AS RESULT...MLCAPE            
RISES NO HIGHER THAN 300-400J/KG. IF DWPTS FALL TOWARD WHAT THE GFS             
MOS GUIDANCE INDICATES FOR SFC DWPTS...SBCAPE WILL BE EVEN LOWER.               
NAM IS MORE MOIST AS IT USUALLY IS...BUT ITS MIXED LAYER DWPTS                  
GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 50S MAY BE MORE REASONABLE BASED ON READINGS             
UPSTREAM TODAY. THIS RESULTS IN MLCAPE RISING POTENTIALLY TO NEAR               
1000J/KG. WITH DEEP LAYER SHEAR OF NO MORE THAN 20-25KT...DO NOT                
ANTICIPATE ANY SVR STORMS. WILL CARRY CHC POPS DURING THE AFTN HRS              
AGAIN ONLY OVER THE W HALF OF UPPER MI WHERE THERE WON`T BE ANY                 
MODIFICATION OF AIRMASS BY MARINE LAYER OFF LAKE MICHIGAN. SPEAKING

ROCKIES WITH DOWNSTREAM RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE SE STATES N TO MI.             
A VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS OVER ERN UPPER MI. THIS WAVE PRODUCED A               
FEW SHRA/ISOLD TSRA OVER THE DOOR PENINSULA AND ACROSS NRN LAKE                 
MICHIGAN TODAY. TO THE W...ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFTING NE THRU MN            
HAS PROBABLY PROVIDED SOME ASSISTANCE TO SHRA/ISOLD TSRA DEVELOPING             
OVER WRN UPPER MI WHERE MLCAPES ARE NEARING 1000J/KG. VIS SATELLITE             
IMAGERY INDICATES ERN FCST AREA REMAINS MORE STABLE DUE TO FLOW OFF             
LAKE MICHIGAN AS CU FIELD HAS SET UP W OF A LINE FROM SHOT POINT TO             
MENOMINEE. DEEP SRLY FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING MOISTURE N INTO THE                
UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/WRN GREAT LAKES. PRECIPITABLE WATER AT

GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 50S MAY BE MORE REASONABLE BASED ON READINGS             
UPSTREAM TODAY. THIS RESULTS IN MLCAPE RISING POTENTIALLY TO NEAR               
1000J/KG. WITH DEEP LAYER SHEAR OF NO MORE THAN 20-25KT...DO NOT

ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING OVER NORTHERN WI AND WESTERN UPPER

CHANCE OF THUNDER. LEFT THUNDER OUT OF FCST FOR THIS AFTERNOON DUE              
TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE THUNDER OCCURRING AT THE TAF SITES...BUT

REFLECT THE SCATTERED TYPE OF PCPN. EXPECT PCPN TO DISSIPATE WITH

.UPDATE (ISSUED AT 1105 AM)...                                                  
MAIN FCST ISSUE THIS AFTN IS SHRA/TSRA POTENTIAL.                               
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A TROF OVER THE ROCKIES               
WITH DOWNSTREAM RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE SE STATES N TO MI. A VERY              
WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS OVER NE WI/CNTRL UPPER MI. SO FAR...WAVE HAS ONLY            
PRODUCED SOME -SHRA/ISOLD TSRA OVER THE DOOR PENINSULA AND JUST E OF            
THERE. TO THE W...ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFTING NE THRU MN WAS                 
PRODUCING A FEW -SHRA/ISOLD TSRA...MAINLY W OF KDLH...BUT SOME SHRA             
HAVE DEVELOPED EWD TOWARD THE KEWEENAW RECENTLY.                                
VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE OVER NE WI IS HEADED MORE ERLY AROUND RIDGE AXIS            
WHILE SHORTWAVE IN MN IS HEADING MORE NRLY. SO...IT DOES NOT APPEAR             
ANY SHORTWAVES WILL DIRECTLY AFFECT THE FCST AREA THIS AFTN TO                  
PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR WIDESPREAD SHRA/TSRA. SHORTWAVES WILL BE CLOSE              
ENOUGH THOUGH TO AID SHRA DEVELOPMENT OVER THE FAR W THIS AFTN AND              
POSSIBLY OVER THE SE FCST AREA FOR THE NEXT FEW HRS. OTHERWISE...               
INSTABILITY WILL BUILD AS HEATING CONTINUES...LEADING TO THE                    
POTENTIAL OF SCT SHRA/TSRA...BUT THERE ARE NO WELL-DEFINED                      
BOUNDARIES TO PROVIDE A STRONG FOCUS. MODIFIED KGRB SOUNDING FOR SFC            
T/TD OF 80/58F YIELDS SBCAPE OF ABOUT 400J/KG WHILE 80/60F YIELDS               
NEARLY 800J/KG. WITH LIMITED SBCAPE AND DEEP LAYER SHEAR ON THE                 
ORDER OF 20-25KT...DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY SVR STORMS THIS AFTN.                  
DECENT SRLY FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN SHOULD KEEP THE ERN FCST AREA                
STABILIZED SUFFICIENTLY TO PRECLUDE ANY SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT AFTER             
THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLD SHRA WITH SHORTWAVE BRUSHING THE SE OVER               
THE NEXT FEW HRS. 12Z RUC FCST SOUNDINGS SUPPORT A DRY FCST THERE.

.PREV DISCUSSION (ISSUED AT 344 AM EDT)...                                      
THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS THE                              
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.             
WATER VAPOR AND RUC/NAM SHOWING A BROAD RIDGE FROM EASTERN MANITOBA             
TO WESTERN QUEBEC...INCLUDING OVER MUCH OF THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. TO            
THE WEST A CLOSED LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN WITH AN                     
ACCOMPANYING TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO WESTERN MONTANA. WEAK              
SHORTWAVES ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE RIDGE AND ARE OVER SOUTHERN                
MINNESOTA... CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA AND IN SASKATCHEWAN. SURFACE                  
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A 1026MB HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND A DEEP            
LOW OVER MIDDLE HIGH PLAINS. ANOTHER LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA.             
A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM STRETCHES EAST TO WEST ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA             
THROUGH THIS LOW...WHILE A WARM FRONT EXTENDS EAST THROUGH NORTHEAST            
WISCONSIN AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. ALSO A COLD FRONT LINKS THE                
MANITOBA LOW WITH THE EASTERN COLORADO LOW. A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER              
IS BUILDING OVER THE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS              
ARE FIRING NORTH OF THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD IN WESTERN ONTARIO...AND            
OVER CENTRAL DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA IN ASSOCIATE WITH THE FRONTAL.                
NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE UPPER            
GREAT LAKES RIDGE WILL BECOME MORE FOCUSED...WHILE THE LOW OVER                 
SASKATCHEWAN DIGS INTO EASTERN MONTANA. ONE OF THE WEAK SHORTWAVES              
OVER SOUTH DAKOTA WILL SWEEP INTO THE WESTERN U.P. WHILE THE REST               
MOVES INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA. 850-500MB Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST               
AND INCREASE IN CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THE            
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST                  
COAST....WHILE THE WEST END OF THE WARM FRONT WASHES OUT. THE                   
SURFACE LOW OVER MANITOBA WILL MOVE INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA                    
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW              
AROUND THE EAST COAST HIGH WILL DRAW WARM GULF MOISTURE INTO THE THE            
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. MUCAPE                
WILL INCREASE TO OVER 1000J/KG OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THEREFORE...               
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS            
AND SHOWERS OVER WISCONSIN AND WESTERN U.P. IN THE AREA OF GREATEST             
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE MAINLY WEST OF US-41 FROM            
MARQUETTE TO ESCANABA.                                                          
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER THE MONTANA WILL STAY MAINLY OVER THE                    
NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS TONIGHT. THE BROAD HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO                   
BLANKET THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME             
STAGNANT OVER WESTERN MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. A STATIONARY              
FRONT REMAINS OVER CENTRAL ONTARIO JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR...AND            
OVER MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. MORE WARM MOIST GULF AIR WILL              
CONTINUE TO BE DRAWN INTO WISCONSIN AND INTO CENTRAL ONTARIO. MODELS            
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT OVER THE AREA. MOST OF THE Q-VECTOR                 
CONVERGENCE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR. MUCAPE VALUES SHOULD            
DROP OFF TO NEAR ZERO OVERNIGHT. THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK DIVERGENCE             
ALOFT. THUS INSTABILITY WILL BECOME MARGINAL OVERNIGHT...AND                    
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM             
TO TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SO WILL KEEP A                      
MENTION GOING...HOWEVER...MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE             
WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.                                            
ON WEDNESDAY...THE GFS STARTS TO HOLD THE SURFACE LOW WEST OVER                 
NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA WHILE THE NAM/GEM/WRF FAVOR A CENTRAL                    
MINNESOTA POSITION. THE UKMET IS A COMPROMISED SOLUTION. MODELS                 
FAVOR THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT...SO WILL FAVOR THE MORE PROGRESS                  
SOLUTIONS. THE MID LEVEL HIGH CONTINUES TO SLIDE DOWN THE ATLANTIC              
COAST WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS STRETCHES ACROSS THE THE FORECAST                 
AREA. MEANWHILE...THE MONTANA LOW WILL SPIN INTO SOUTHEAST MONTANA.             
SHORTWAVE SWEEPING THROUGH THE BASE OF THIS LOW WILL SAIL ACROSS THE            
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME FOCUSED OVER CENTRAL                 
MINNESOTA WITH THE CANADIAN COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS NORTHERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR...AND THE PLAINS COLD FRONT DRAPED SOUTHWEST INTO THE             
EASTERN KANSAS. DEEP MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE DRAWN INTO THE                    
FORECAST AREA FEEDING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON                  
WEDNESDAY.                                                                      
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER MONTANA WILL SLIP INTO NORTH CENTRAL SOUTH               
DAKOTA WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY                 
NIGHT. WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL TRACK THROUGH THE RIDGE OVER THE                    
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LIFT INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA               
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. THE CANADIAN                    
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN STATIONARY OVER NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR.              
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE A              
CHANCE OF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST             
THAT THE MOST UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE ALONG THE CANADIAN FRONTAL                   
SYSTEM.                                                                         
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR KBIS...WITH A              
NUMBER OF WEAK SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW ON THURSDAY AND              
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW WILL ALSO BE PULLED NORTHWEST TO THE            
NORTH SIDE OF THE MID LEVEL LOW AND MOVE INTO NORTH CENTRAL NORTH               
DAKOTA. THE CANADIAN FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER CENTRAL                    
ONTARIO. A WEAK SHORTWAVE BEING EJECTED OUT AHEAD OF THE OF MID                 
LEVEL LOW WILL ATTEMPT TO TRAVERSE THE FORECAST AREA GENERATING A               
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS THE LOW BACKS WEST...THE                
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL ALSO WEAKEN...BUT STILL APPEARS TO BE STRONG             
ENOUGH TO KEEP A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS GOING ESPECIALLY COUPLED               
WITH AFTERNOON HEATING. GUIDANCE SHOWING SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL BE             
HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE FOG OVER THE COOL WATERS OF LAKE SUPERIOR.               
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY ALLOWING THE             
MID LEVEL LOW TO TREK EAST TO NEAR KJMS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LINE              
UP WITH THE MID LEVEL LOW ALLOWING THE PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM TO MOVE            
INTO WESTERN IOWA. THE CANADIAN FRONT SYSTEM WILL LIKEWISE REMAIN               
WEAK AND OVER THE NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS             
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REAL POSSIBILITY. CURRENT GRIDS LOOK OK FOR               
NOW.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 337 AM EDT TUE MAY 29 2007/                         
DISCUSSION...A SEEMINGLY BROKEN RECORD FORECAST APPEARS ON TAP FOR              
MUCH IF NOT ALL OF THE WORK WEEK...AND POTENTIALLY HEADING INTO THE             
WEEKEND...WITH WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS IN PLACE ALONG WITH                    
OCCASIONAL CHANCES FOR CONVECTION. THE MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGES                 
THROUGH THE NEXT 5 DAYS ARE JUST HOW WARM THINGS WILL GET EACH                  
AFTERNOON...ALONG WITH TIMING/COVERAGE OF ALMOST DAILY CHANCES FOR              
CONVECTION. EARLY MORNING SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS PLACES AN ELONGATED               
BUT FAIRLY WEAK (1024MB) SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES             
AND INTO THE NORTHEAST...WITH A STATIONARY FRONT DRAPED OVER THE                
NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY BEFORE BECOMING A WARM FRONT OVER THE MID                  
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN DEVELOPING RETURN FLOW/WARM ADVECTION REGIME.             
ALOFT...RATHER IMPRESSIVE SHORTWAVE PER EVENING WATER VAPOR PICS                
NOTED DIVING INTO EASTERN IDAHO...WITH HEIGHT FALLS EMERGING ONTO               
THE WESTERN HIGH PLAINS DRIVING SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THIS                  
REGION...BUT AIDING IN DOWNSTREAM HEIGHT RISES OVER MUCH OF THE                 
EASTERN CONUS AS UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD. IT IS THESE TWO                   
FEATURES (THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS            
THE REGION) THAT WILL DRIVE THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE UPPER GREAT            
LAKES FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK.                                                     
FOR TODAY...ONGOING WARM ADVECTION THIS MORNING (H85 TEMPS ALREADY              
AT +10C PER 00Z APX SOUNDING) WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY AS LOW              
LEVEL RIDGE AXIS REMAINS PARKED OFF TO THE EAST...AND BROAD                     
SOUTHWEST FLOW OVERSPREAD THE AREA. INITIAL SHOT OF 850-700 MB                  
THERMAL/MOISTURE ADVECTION THIS MORNING SHOULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE                
AN EXPANDING LOW/MID CLOUD DECK ACROSS THE AREA...BUT THIS LIKELY               
TO BE SHORT LIVED (BEFORE BEING REPLACED BY CU FIELD THIS                       
AFTERNOON)...SO PARTLY CLOUDY SHOULD DO IT. H85 TEMPS PROGGED TO                
JUMP TO +14C BY 00Z TONIGHT...AND THIS APPEARS LIKELY GIVEN                     
UPSTREAM SOUNDINGS THIS PAST EVENING. SURFACE WARM FRONT LIFTING                
TOWARD THE AREA THIS MORNING WILL LIKELY BECOME QUITE DIFFUSE BY                
AFTERNOON AS IT SIMPLY MIXES NORTH TO REFOCUS ACROSS ONTARIO IN                 
ASSOCIATION WITH DEVELOPING LEE CYCLONE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS.               
THIS WILL ESSENTIALLY LEAVE THE AREA IN WHAT WILL BECOME A VERY                 
BROAD WARM SECTOR ACROSS MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CONUS.                 
GOOD INSOLATION AND HEATING THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD RESULT IN DECENT              
CONVECTIVE MIXING TO YIELD HIGHS WELL INTO THE 70S TO LOWER 80S.                
WITH AN INCREASE IN DEW POINTS ALSO OCCURRING...WILL HAVE TO BEGIN              
TO PONDER CHANCES FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTION. NAM/GFS APPEAR TO                   
STILL BE OVERDOING SURFACE DEW POINTS...AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRODUCING              
SPURIOUSLY HIGH VALUES OF CAPE (1500+ J/KG). A MORE LIKELY                      
SCENARIO FOR TODAY GIVEN EXPECTED MIXING OUT OF HIGHER THETA-E AIR              
YIELDS DEW POINTS INTO THE LOW AND MID 50S...WHICH STILL DOES                   
YIELD SOME MLCAPE (300-500 J/KG OR SO). WITH REGION FALLING ON THE              
WESTERN FRINGE OF STILL BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE AND CAPPING                    
INVERSION NOT OVERLY STRONG...APPEARS EXPECTED CAPE MAY STILL BE                
SUFFICIENT TO POP A FEW STORMS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE THE                 
LACK OF A FORCING MECHANISM...AS LAKE BREEZES LOOK TO REMAIN                    
MOSTLY SUPPRESSED WITH SUFFICIENT BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW (15-20 KNOTS              
OR SO)...THOUGH ANY WEAK TURNING OF THE WINDS OFF THE LAKES OR                  
LOCALIZED CONVERGENCE (SUCH AS THAT WHICH OFTEN OCCURS OVER THE                 
HIGHER TERRAIN) MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE AS A FOCUS. GIVEN                    
OVERALL LACK OF FORCING MECHANISM AND INSTABILITY...GOING 20 POP                
LOOKS VERY GOOD AND WILL SIMPLY CHANGE WORDING TO `ISOLATED`.                   
TONIGHT WILL BE THE FIRST OF A FEW WARM AND RATHER HUMID NIGHTS                 
WITH DEW POINTS CREEPING UP AND NOT ALLOWING TEMPS TO FALL VERY                 
MUCH. WITH LOW LEVEL RIDGE AXIS STILL ATTEMPTING TO HANG ON...                  
SHOULD SEE WINDS SLACKEN AFTER SUNSET...AND COULD EVEN SEE A BIT                
OF LIGHT FOG WITH AREA FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN LOW LEVEL THETA-E                   
RIDGE. HAVE ALSO HELD ONTO EARLY ISOLATED TSRA MENTION WITH                     
POTENTIAL FOR ANYTHING WHICH DEVELOPS TODAY TO HANG ON FOR A FEW                
HOURS AFTER SUNSET PER ELEVATED INSTABILITY IN PLACE. LOWS TONIGHT              
MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S.                                                 
FOR TOMORROW INTO TOMORROW NIGHT...A SIMILAR SCENARIO WITH REGARD TO            
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL WILL REPEAT ITSELF...THOUGH WITH SUBTLE CHANGES            
TO THE OVERALL SETUP. BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE OVERHEAD WITH H5                 
HEIGHTS PROGGED BETTER THAN 582 DM WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A MORE                 
PRONOUNCED MID LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION. HOWEVER...WITH H85 TEMPS                
CLIMBING EVEN A BIT HIGHER (+15C ON THE GFS/+16C ON THE ECMWF) AND              
SLIGHTLY BETTER MIXING EXPECTED...HIGHS WILL ALSO BE A FEW DEGREES              
WARMER...MAINLY IN THE MIDDLE AND EVEN UPPER 80S PER NOMOGRAMS. THIS            
COUPLED WITH A TOUCH HIGHER DEW POINTS (PERHAPS NEAR 60) SHOULD                 
YIELD MLCAPES PERHAPS APPROACHING 800 J/KG...THOUGH AGAIN THE                   
PROBLEM WILL BE A FORCING/FOCUSING MECHANISM AS FLOW APPEARS JUST A             
BIT TOO FAST TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT LAKE BREEZE COMPONENT. SO IT                
WILL BE A BALANCING AT AS INCREASED INSTABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN A              
BIT MORE WIDESPREAD DEVELOPMENT...THOUGH DEGREE OF CAPPING INVERSION            
SOMETHING TO BE WATCHED. WILL ALSO AGAIN HOLD OVER MENTION INTO THE             
LATE EVENING HOURS OF TOMORROW TO CATCH ANYTHING THAT MAY LINGER.               
WILL AGAIN BE ANOTHER WARM NIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT WITH LOWS MAINLY                
UPPER 50S.                                                                      
LATER PERIODS (THURSDAY INTO SATURDAY)...VERY LITTLE APPEARS LIKELY             
TO CHANGE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AS BROAD LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE AXIS              
SLIPS JUST A TAD FARTHER BUT IT STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF THE                  
WEATHER. SUBTLE HEIGHTS FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EASTWARD                      
DISPLACEMENT OF THIS FEATURE APPEAR SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE A LESS                
CAPPED ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION...FLOW WILL BE ATTEMPTING TO BECOME             
SLIGHTLY DIVERGENT ALOFT AS UPPER GYRE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS                 
SLOWLY PUSHES EAST. THIS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED RICH BOUNDARY LAYER             
MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENT HEATING IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY GOING CHANCE               
POPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. HIGHS A BIT MORE TRICKY ON THURSDAY                   
PENDING POTENTIAL FOR UPSTREAM CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUD TO SPILL                 
ACROSS THE REGION...BUT WITH GOOD MIXING AND H85 TEMPS HOLDING                  
STRONG AROUND +14C...COULD EASILY BE ANOTHER DAY IN THE 80S.                    
THE FORECAST BEYOND THURSDAY NIGHT REMAINS QUITE MURKY WITH REGARDS             
TO TIMING OF SYSTEM WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH OUT OF THE PLAINS AND            
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. MODELS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR SLOWING TREND               
OWING TO A MORE AMPLIFIED EASTERN CONUS RIDGE AND ALSO A DEEPER                 
CYCLONE. BEST GUESS AT THIS POINT IS FOR THE BETTER CHANCES OF MORE             
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS TO COME LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.                
THIS IS IN LINE WITH GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN DEPICTION OF BEST HEIGHT                 
FALLS/SYNOPTIC SUPPORT...WHICH AGREES WITH THE MORE CONSISTENT                  
ECMWF. TEMPS WILL TAKE A GRADUAL DOWNWARD TURN HEADING INTO THE                 
WEEKEND AS WELL.

MAIN FCST ISSUE THIS AFTN IS SHRA/TSRA POTENTIAL.                               
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A TROF OVER THE ROCKIES               
WITH DOWNSTREAM RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE SE STATES N TO MI. A VERY              
WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS OVER NE WI/CNTRL UPPER MI. SO FAR...WAVE HAS ONLY            
PRODUCED SOME -SHRA/ISOLD TSRA OVER THE DOOR PENINSULA AND JUST E OF            
THERE. TO THE W...ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFTING NE THRU MN WAS                 
PRODUCING A FEW -SHRA/ISOLD TSRA...MAINLY W OF KDLH...BUT SOME SHRA             
HAVE DEVELOPED EWD TOWARD THE KEWEENAW RECENTLY.                                
VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE OVER NE WI IS HEADED MORE ERLY AROUND RIDGE AXIS            
WHILE SHORTWAVE IN MN IS HEADING MORE NRLY. SO...IT DOES NOT APPEAR             
ANY SHORTWAVES WILL DIRECTLY AFFECT THE FCST AREA THIS AFTN TO                  
PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR WIDESPREAD SHRA/TSRA. SHORTWAVES WILL BE CLOSE              
ENOUGH THOUGH TO AID SHRA DEVELOPMENT OVER THE FAR W THIS AFTN AND              
POSSIBLY OVER THE SE FCST AREA FOR THE NEXT FEW HRS. OTHERWISE...               
INSTABILITY WILL BUILD AS HEATING CONTINUES...LEADING TO THE                    
POTENTIAL OF SCT SHRA/TSRA...BUT THERE ARE NO WELL-DEFINED                      
BOUNDARIES TO PROVIDE A STRONG FOCUS. MODIFIED KGRB SOUNDING FOR SFC            
T/TD OF 80/58F YIELDS SBCAPE OF ABOUT 400J/KG WHILE 80/60F YIELDS               
NEARLY 800J/KG. WITH LIMITED SBCAPE AND DEEP LAYER SHEAR ON THE                 
ORDER OF 20-25KT...DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY SVR STORMS THIS AFTN.                  
DECENT SRLY FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN SHOULD KEEP THE ERN FCST AREA                
STABILIZED SUFFICIENTLY TO PRECLUDE ANY SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT AFTER             
THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLD SHRA WITH SHORTWAVE BRUSHING THE SE OVER               
THE NEXT FEW HRS. 12Z RUC FCST SOUNDINGS SUPPORT A DRY FCST THERE.

.PREV DISCUSSION (ISSUED AT 344 AM EDT)...                                      
THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS THE                              
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.             
WATER VAPOR AND RUC/NAM SHOWING A BROAD RIDGE FROM EASTERN MANITOBA             
TO WESTERN QUEBEC...INCLUDING OVER MUCH OF THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. TO            
THE WEST A CLOSED LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN WITH AN                     
ACCOMPANYING TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO WESTERN MONTANA. WEAK              
SHORTWAVES ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE RIDGE AND ARE OVER SOUTHERN                
MINNESOTA... CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA AND IN SASKATCHEWAN. SURFACE                  
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A 1026MB HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND A DEEP            
LOW OVER MIDDLE HIGH PLAINS. ANOTHER LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA.             
A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM STRETCHES EAST TO WEST ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA             
THROUGH THIS LOW...WHILE A WARM FRONT EXTENDS EAST THROUGH NORTHEAST            
WISCONSIN AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. ALSO A COLD FRONT LINKS THE                
MANITOBA LOW WITH THE EASTERN COLORADO LOW. A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER              
IS BUILDING OVER THE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS              
ARE FIRING NORTH OF THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD IN WESTERN ONTARIO...AND            
OVER CENTRAL DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA IN ASSOCIATE WITH THE FRONTAL.                
NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE UPPER            
GREAT LAKES RIDGE WILL BECOME MORE FOCUSED...WHILE THE LOW OVER                 
SASKATCHEWAN DIGS INTO EASTERN MONTANA. ONE OF THE WEAK SHORTWAVES              
OVER SOUTH DAKOTA WILL SWEEP INTO THE WESTERN U.P. WHILE THE REST               
MOVES INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA. 850-500MB Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST               
AND INCREASE IN CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THE            
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST                  
COAST....WHILE THE WEST END OF THE WARM FRONT WASHES OUT. THE                   
SURFACE LOW OVER MANITOBA WILL MOVE INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA                    
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW              
AROUND THE EAST COAST HIGH WILL DRAW WARM GULF MOISTURE INTO THE THE            
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. MUCAPE                
WILL INCREASE TO OVER 1000J/KG OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THEREFORE...               
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS            
AND SHOWERS OVER WISCONSIN AND WESTERN U.P. IN THE AREA OF GREATEST             
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE MAINLY WEST OF US-41 FROM            
MARQUETTE TO ESCANABA.                                                          
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER THE MONTANA WILL STAY MAINLY OVER THE                    
NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS TONIGHT. THE BROAD HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO                   
BLANKET THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME             
STAGNANT OVER WESTERN MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. A STATIONARY              
FRONT REMAINS OVER CENTRAL ONTARIO JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR...AND            
OVER MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. MORE WARM MOIST GULF AIR WILL              
CONTINUE TO BE DRAWN INTO WISCONSIN AND INTO CENTRAL ONTARIO. MODELS            
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT OVER THE AREA. MOST OF THE Q-VECTOR                 
CONVERGENCE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR. MUCAPE VALUES SHOULD            
DROP OFF TO NEAR ZERO OVERNIGHT. THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK DIVERGENCE             
ALOFT. THUS INSTABILITY WILL BECOME MARGINAL OVERNIGHT...AND                    
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM             
TO TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SO WILL KEEP A                      
MENTION GOING...HOWEVER...MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE             
WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.                                            
ON WEDNESDAY...THE GFS STARTS TO HOLD THE SURFACE LOW WEST OVER                 
NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA WHILE THE NAM/GEM/WRF FAVOR A CENTRAL                    
MINNESOTA POSITION. THE UKMET IS A COMPROMISED SOLUTION. MODELS                 
FAVOR THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT...SO WILL FAVOR THE MORE PROGRESS

COAST WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS STRETCHES ACROSS THE THE FORECAST                 
AREA. MEANWHILE...THE MONTANA LOW WILL SPIN INTO SOUTHEAST MONTANA.             
SHORTWAVE SWEEPING THROUGH THE BASE OF THIS LOW WILL SAIL ACROSS THE            
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME FOCUSED OVER CENTRAL                 
MINNESOTA WITH THE CANADIAN COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS NORTHERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR...AND THE PLAINS COLD FRONT DRAPED SOUTHWEST INTO THE             
EASTERN KANSAS. DEEP MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE DRAWN INTO THE                    
FORECAST AREA FEEDING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON

THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER MONTANA WILL SLIP INTO NORTH CENTRAL SOUTH               
DAKOTA WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY                 
NIGHT. WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL TRACK THROUGH THE RIDGE OVER THE                    
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LIFT INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA               
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. THE CANADIAN                    
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN STATIONARY OVER NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR.              
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE A              
CHANCE OF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST             
THAT THE MOST UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE ALONG THE CANADIAN FRONTAL                   
SYSTEM.                                                                         
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR KBIS...WITH A              
NUMBER OF WEAK SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW ON THURSDAY AND              
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW WILL ALSO BE PULLED NORTHWEST TO THE            
NORTH SIDE OF THE MID LEVEL LOW AND MOVE INTO NORTH CENTRAL NORTH               
DAKOTA. THE CANADIAN FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER CENTRAL                    
ONTARIO. A WEAK SHORTWAVE BEING EJECTED OUT AHEAD OF THE OF MID                 
LEVEL LOW WILL ATTEMPT TO TRAVERSE THE FORECAST AREA GENERATING A               
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS THE LOW BACKS WEST...THE                
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL ALSO WEAKEN...BUT STILL APPEARS TO BE STRONG             
ENOUGH TO KEEP A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS GOING ESPECIALLY COUPLED               
WITH AFTERNOON HEATING. GUIDANCE SHOWING SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL BE             
HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE FOG OVER THE COOL WATERS OF LAKE SUPERIOR.               
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY ALLOWING THE             
MID LEVEL LOW TO TREK EAST TO NEAR KJMS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LINE              
UP WITH THE MID LEVEL LOW ALLOWING THE PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM TO MOVE            
INTO WESTERN IOWA. THE CANADIAN FRONT SYSTEM WILL LIKEWISE REMAIN               
WEAK AND OVER THE NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS             
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REAL POSSIBILITY. CURRENT GRIDS LOOK OK FOR

MUCH IF NOT ALL OF THE WORK WEEK...AND POTENTIALLY HEADING INTO THE             
WEEKEND...WITH WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS IN PLACE ALONG WITH                    
OCCASIONAL CHANCES FOR CONVECTION. THE MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGES                 
THROUGH THE NEXT 5 DAYS ARE JUST HOW WARM THINGS WILL GET EACH                  
AFTERNOON...ALONG WITH TIMING/COVERAGE OF ALMOST DAILY CHANCES FOR              
CONVECTION. EARLY MORNING SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS PLACES AN ELONGATED               
BUT FAIRLY WEAK (1024MB) SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES             
AND INTO THE NORTHEAST...WITH A STATIONARY FRONT DRAPED OVER THE                
NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY BEFORE BECOMING A WARM FRONT OVER THE MID                  
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN DEVELOPING RETURN FLOW/WARM ADVECTION REGIME.             
ALOFT...RATHER IMPRESSIVE SHORTWAVE PER EVENING WATER VAPOR PICS                
NOTED DIVING INTO EASTERN IDAHO...WITH HEIGHT FALLS EMERGING ONTO               
THE WESTERN HIGH PLAINS DRIVING SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THIS                  
REGION...BUT AIDING IN DOWNSTREAM HEIGHT RISES OVER MUCH OF THE                 
EASTERN CONUS AS UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD. IT IS THESE TWO                   
FEATURES (THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS            
THE REGION) THAT WILL DRIVE THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE UPPER GREAT            
LAKES FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK.                                                     
FOR TODAY...ONGOING WARM ADVECTION THIS MORNING (H85 TEMPS ALREADY              
AT +10C PER 00Z APX SOUNDING) WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY AS LOW              
LEVEL RIDGE AXIS REMAINS PARKED OFF TO THE EAST...AND BROAD                     
SOUTHWEST FLOW OVERSPREAD THE AREA. INITIAL SHOT OF 850-700 MB                  
THERMAL/MOISTURE ADVECTION THIS MORNING SHOULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE                
AN EXPANDING LOW/MID CLOUD DECK ACROSS THE AREA...BUT THIS LIKELY               
TO BE SHORT LIVED (BEFORE BEING REPLACED BY CU FIELD THIS                       
AFTERNOON)...SO PARTLY CLOUDY SHOULD DO IT. H85 TEMPS PROGGED TO                
JUMP TO +14C BY 00Z TONIGHT...AND THIS APPEARS LIKELY GIVEN                     
UPSTREAM SOUNDINGS THIS PAST EVENING. SURFACE WARM FRONT LIFTING                
TOWARD THE AREA THIS MORNING WILL LIKELY BECOME QUITE DIFFUSE BY                
AFTERNOON AS IT SIMPLY MIXES NORTH TO REFOCUS ACROSS ONTARIO IN                 
ASSOCIATION WITH DEVELOPING LEE CYCLONE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS.               
THIS WILL ESSENTIALLY LEAVE THE AREA IN WHAT WILL BECOME A VERY                 
BROAD WARM SECTOR ACROSS MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CONUS.                 
GOOD INSOLATION AND HEATING THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD RESULT IN DECENT              
CONVECTIVE MIXING TO YIELD HIGHS WELL INTO THE 70S TO LOWER 80S.                
WITH AN INCREASE IN DEW POINTS ALSO OCCURRING...WILL HAVE TO BEGIN              
TO PONDER CHANCES FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTION. NAM/GFS APPEAR TO                   
STILL BE OVERDOING SURFACE DEW POINTS...AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRODUCING              
SPURIOUSLY HIGH VALUES OF CAPE (1500+ J/KG). A MORE LIKELY                      
SCENARIO FOR TODAY GIVEN EXPECTED MIXING OUT OF HIGHER THETA-E AIR              
YIELDS DEW POINTS INTO THE LOW AND MID 50S...WHICH STILL DOES                   
YIELD SOME MLCAPE (300-500 J/KG OR SO). WITH REGION FALLING ON THE              
WESTERN FRINGE OF STILL BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE AND CAPPING                    
INVERSION NOT OVERLY STRONG...APPEARS EXPECTED CAPE MAY STILL BE                
SUFFICIENT TO POP A FEW STORMS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE THE                 
LACK OF A FORCING MECHANISM...AS LAKE BREEZES LOOK TO REMAIN                    
MOSTLY SUPPRESSED WITH SUFFICIENT BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW (15-20 KNOTS              
OR SO)...THOUGH ANY WEAK TURNING OF THE WINDS OFF THE LAKES OR                  
LOCALIZED CONVERGENCE (SUCH AS THAT WHICH OFTEN OCCURS OVER THE                 
HIGHER TERRAIN) MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE AS A FOCUS. GIVEN                    
OVERALL LACK OF FORCING MECHANISM AND INSTABILITY...GOING 20 POP                
LOOKS VERY GOOD AND WILL SIMPLY CHANGE WORDING TO `ISOLATED`.                   
TONIGHT WILL BE THE FIRST OF A FEW WARM AND RATHER HUMID NIGHTS                 
WITH DEW POINTS CREEPING UP AND NOT ALLOWING TEMPS TO FALL VERY                 
MUCH. WITH LOW LEVEL RIDGE AXIS STILL ATTEMPTING TO HANG ON...                  
SHOULD SEE WINDS SLACKEN AFTER SUNSET...AND COULD EVEN SEE A BIT                
OF LIGHT FOG WITH AREA FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN LOW LEVEL THETA-E                   
RIDGE. HAVE ALSO HELD ONTO EARLY ISOLATED TSRA MENTION WITH                     
POTENTIAL FOR ANYTHING WHICH DEVELOPS TODAY TO HANG ON FOR A FEW                
HOURS AFTER SUNSET PER ELEVATED INSTABILITY IN PLACE. LOWS TONIGHT              
MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S.                                                 
FOR TOMORROW INTO TOMORROW NIGHT...A SIMILAR SCENARIO WITH REGARD TO            
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL WILL REPEAT ITSELF...THOUGH WITH SUBTLE CHANGES            
TO THE OVERALL SETUP. BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE OVERHEAD WITH H5                 
HEIGHTS PROGGED BETTER THAN 582 DM WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A MORE                 
PRONOUNCED MID LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION. HOWEVER...WITH H85 TEMPS                
CLIMBING EVEN A BIT HIGHER (+15C ON THE GFS/+16C ON THE ECMWF) AND              
SLIGHTLY BETTER MIXING EXPECTED...HIGHS WILL ALSO BE A FEW DEGREES              
WARMER...MAINLY IN THE MIDDLE AND EVEN UPPER 80S PER NOMOGRAMS. THIS            
COUPLED WITH A TOUCH HIGHER DEW POINTS (PERHAPS NEAR 60) SHOULD                 
YIELD MLCAPES PERHAPS APPROACHING 800 J/KG...THOUGH AGAIN THE                   
PROBLEM WILL BE A FORCING/FOCUSING MECHANISM AS FLOW APPEARS JUST A             
BIT TOO FAST TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT LAKE BREEZE COMPONENT. SO IT                
WILL BE A BALANCING AT AS INCREASED INSTABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN A              
BIT MORE WIDESPREAD DEVELOPMENT...THOUGH DEGREE OF CAPPING INVERSION            
SOMETHING TO BE WATCHED. WILL ALSO AGAIN HOLD OVER MENTION INTO THE             
LATE EVENING HOURS OF TOMORROW TO CATCH ANYTHING THAT MAY LINGER.               
WILL AGAIN BE ANOTHER WARM NIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT WITH LOWS MAINLY                
UPPER 50S.                                                                      
LATER PERIODS (THURSDAY INTO SATURDAY)...VERY LITTLE APPEARS LIKELY             
TO CHANGE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AS BROAD LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE AXIS              
SLIPS JUST A TAD FARTHER BUT IT STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF THE                  
WEATHER. SUBTLE HEIGHTS FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EASTWARD                      
DISPLACEMENT OF THIS FEATURE APPEAR SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE A LESS                
CAPPED ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION...FLOW WILL BE ATTEMPTING TO BECOME             
SLIGHTLY DIVERGENT ALOFT AS UPPER GYRE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS                 
SLOWLY PUSHES EAST. THIS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED RICH BOUNDARY LAYER             
MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENT HEATING IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY GOING CHANCE               
POPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. HIGHS A BIT MORE TRICKY ON THURSDAY                   
PENDING POTENTIAL FOR UPSTREAM CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUD TO SPILL                 
ACROSS THE REGION...BUT WITH GOOD MIXING AND H85 TEMPS HOLDING                  
STRONG AROUND +14C...COULD EASILY BE ANOTHER DAY IN THE 80S.                    
THE FORECAST BEYOND THURSDAY NIGHT REMAINS QUITE MURKY WITH REGARDS             
TO TIMING OF SYSTEM WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH OUT OF THE PLAINS AND            
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. MODELS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR SLOWING TREND               
OWING TO A MORE AMPLIFIED EASTERN CONUS RIDGE AND ALSO A DEEPER                 
CYCLONE. BEST GUESS AT THIS POINT IS FOR THE BETTER CHANCES OF MORE             
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS TO COME LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.                
THIS IS IN LINE WITH GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN DEPICTION OF BEST HEIGHT                 
FALLS/SYNOPTIC SUPPORT...WHICH AGREES WITH THE MORE CONSISTENT

735 AM EDT TUE MAY 29 2007                                                      
.DISCUSSION (ISSUED AT 344 AM EDT)...                                           
THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS THE                              
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.             
WATER VAPOR AND RUC/NAM SHOWING A BROAD RIDGE FROM EASTERN MANITOBA             
TO WESTERN QUEBEC...INCLUDING OVER MUCH OF THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. TO            
THE WEST A CLOSED LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN WITH AN                     
ACCOMPANYING TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO WESTERN MONTANA. WEAK              
SHORTWAVES ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE RIDGE AND ARE OVER SOUTHERN                
MINNESOTA... CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA AND IN SASKATCHEWAN. SURFACE                  
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A 1026MB HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND A DEEP            
LOW OVER MIDDLE HIGH PLAINS. ANOTHER LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA.             
A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM STRETCHES EAST TO WEST ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA             
THROUGH THIS LOW...WHILE A WARM FRONT EXTENDS EAST THROUGH NORTHEAST            
WISCONSIN AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. ALSO A COLD FRONT LINKS THE                
MANITOBA LOW WITH THE EASTERN COLORADO LOW. A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER              
IS BUILDING OVER THE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS              
ARE FIRING NORTH OF THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD IN WESTERN ONTARIO...AND            
OVER CENTRAL DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA IN ASSOCIATE WITH THE FRONTAL.                
NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE UPPER            
GREAT LAKES RIDGE WILL BECOME MORE FOCUSED...WHILE THE LOW OVER                 
SASKATCHEWAN DIGS INTO EASTERN MONTANA. ONE OF THE WEAK SHORTWAVES              
OVER SOUTH DAKOTA WILL SWEEP INTO THE WESTERN U.P. WHILE THE REST               
MOVES INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA. 850-500MB Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST               
AND INCREASE IN CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THE            
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST                  
COAST....WHILE THE WEST END OF THE WARM FRONT WASHES OUT. THE                   
SURFACE LOW OVER MANITOBA WILL MOVE INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA                    
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW              
AROUND THE EAST COAST HIGH WILL DRAW WARM GULF MOISTURE INTO THE THE            
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. MUCAPE                
WILL INCREASE TO OVER 1000J/KG OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THEREFORE...               
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS            
AND SHOWERS OVER WISCONSIN AND WESTERN U.P. IN THE AREA OF GREATEST             
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE MAINLY WEST OF US-41 FROM            
MARQUETTE TO ESCANABA.                                                          
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER THE MONTANA WILL STAY MAINLY OVER THE                    
NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS TONIGHT. THE BROAD HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO                   
BLANKET THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME             
STAGNANT OVER WESTERN MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. A STATIONARY              
FRONT REMAINS OVER CENTRAL ONTARIO JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR...AND            
OVER MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. MORE WARM MOIST GULF AIR WILL              
CONTINUE TO BE DRAWN INTO WISCONSIN AND INTO CENTRAL ONTARIO. MODELS            
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT OVER THE AREA. MOST OF THE Q-VECTOR                 
CONVERGENCE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR. MUCAPE VALUES SHOULD            
DROP OFF TO NEAR ZERO OVERNIGHT. THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK DIVERGENCE             
ALOFT. THUS INSTABILITY WILL BECOME MARGINAL OVERNIGHT...AND                    
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM             
TO TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SO WILL KEEP A                      
MENTION GOING...HOWEVER...MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE             
WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.                                            
ON WEDNESDAY...THE GFS STARTS TO HOLD THE SURFACE LOW WEST OVER                 
NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA WHILE THE NAM/GEM/WRF FAVOR A CENTRAL                    
MINNESOTA POSITION. THE UKMET IS A COMPROMISED SOLUTION. MODELS                 
FAVOR THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT...SO WILL FAVOR THE MORE PROGRESS                  
SOLUTIONS. THE MID LEVEL HIGH CONTINUES TO SLIDE DOWN THE ATLANTIC              
COAST WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS STRETCHES ACROSS THE THE FORECAST                 
AREA. MEANWHILE...THE MONTANA LOW WILL SPIN INTO SOUTHEAST MONTANA.             
SHORTWAVE SWEEPING THROUGH THE BASE OF THIS LOW WILL SAIL ACROSS THE            
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME FOCUSED OVER CENTRAL                 
MINNESOTA WITH THE CANADIAN COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS NORTHERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR...AND THE PLAINS COLD FRONT DRAPED SOUTHWEST INTO THE             
EASTERN KANSAS. DEEP MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE DRAWN INTO THE                    
FORECAST AREA FEEDING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON                  
WEDNESDAY.                                                                      
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER MONTANA WILL SLIP INTO NORTH CENTRAL SOUTH               
DAKOTA WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY                 
NIGHT. WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL TRACK THROUGH THE RIDGE OVER THE                    
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LIFT INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA               
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. THE CANADIAN                    
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN STATIONARY OVER NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR.              
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE A              
CHANCE OF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST             
THAT THE MOST UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE ALONG THE CANADIAN FRONTAL                   
SYSTEM.                                                                         
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR KBIS...WITH A              
NUMBER OF WEAK SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW ON THURSDAY AND              
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW WILL ALSO BE PULLED NORTHWEST TO THE            
NORTH SIDE OF THE MID LEVEL LOW AND MOVE INTO NORTH CENTRAL NORTH               
DAKOTA. THE CANADIAN FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER CENTRAL                    
ONTARIO. A WEAK SHORTWAVE BEING EJECTED OUT AHEAD OF THE OF MID                 
LEVEL LOW WILL ATTEMPT TO TRAVERSE THE FORECAST AREA GENERATING A               
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS THE LOW BACKS WEST...THE                
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL ALSO WEAKEN...BUT STILL APPEARS TO BE STRONG             
ENOUGH TO KEEP A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS GOING ESPECIALLY COUPLED               
WITH AFTERNOON HEATING. GUIDANCE SHOWING SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL BE             
HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE FOG OVER THE COOL WATERS OF LAKE SUPERIOR.               
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY ALLOWING THE             
MID LEVEL LOW TO TREK EAST TO NEAR KJMS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LINE              
UP WITH THE MID LEVEL LOW ALLOWING THE PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM TO MOVE            
INTO WESTERN IOWA. THE CANADIAN FRONT SYSTEM WILL LIKEWISE REMAIN               
WEAK AND OVER THE NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS             
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REAL POSSIBILITY. CURRENT GRIDS LOOK OK FOR               
NOW.

WISCONSIN AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. ALSO A COLD FRONT LINKS THE                
MANITOBA LOW WITH THE EASTERN COLORADO LOW. A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER              
IS BUILDING OVER THE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS              
ARE FIRING NORTH OF THE MINNESOTA ARROWHEAD IN WESTERN ONTARIO...AND            
OVER CENTRAL DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA IN ASSOCIATE WITH THE FRONTAL.                
NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE UPPER            
GREAT LAKES RIDGE WILL BECOME MORE FOCUSED...WHILE THE LOW OVER                 
SASKATCHEWAN DIGS INTO EASTERN MONTANA. ONE OF THE WEAK SHORTWAVES              
OVER SOUTH DAKOTA WILL SWEEP INTO THE WESTERN U.P. WHILE THE REST               
MOVES INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA. 850-500MB Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST               
AND INCREASE IN CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THE            
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST                  
COAST....WHILE THE WEST END OF THE WARM FRONT WASHES OUT. THE                   
SURFACE LOW OVER MANITOBA WILL MOVE INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA                    
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW              
AROUND THE EAST COAST HIGH WILL DRAW WARM GULF MOISTURE INTO THE THE            
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. MUCAPE                
WILL INCREASE TO OVER 1000J/KG OVER THE WESTERN U.P. THEREFORE...               
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS            
AND SHOWERS OVER WISCONSIN AND WESTERN U.P. IN THE AREA OF GREATEST             
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL BE MAINLY WEST OF US-41 FROM            
MARQUETTE TO ESCANABA.                                                          
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER THE MONTANA WILL STAY MAINLY OVER THE                    
NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS TONIGHT. THE BROAD HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO                   
BLANKET THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME             
STAGNANT OVER WESTERN MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. A STATIONARY              
FRONT REMAINS OVER CENTRAL ONTARIO JUST NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR...AND            
OVER MINNESOTA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA. MORE WARM MOIST GULF AIR WILL              
CONTINUE TO BE DRAWN INTO WISCONSIN AND INTO CENTRAL ONTARIO. MODELS            
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT OVER THE AREA. MOST OF THE Q-VECTOR                 
CONVERGENCE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR. MUCAPE VALUES SHOULD            
DROP OFF TO NEAR ZERO OVERNIGHT. THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK DIVERGENCE             
ALOFT. THUS INSTABILITY WILL BECOME MARGINAL OVERNIGHT...AND                    
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM             
TO TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SO WILL KEEP A                      
MENTION GOING...HOWEVER...MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE             
WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.                                            
ON WEDNESDAY...THE GFS STARTS TO HOLD THE SURFACE LOW WEST OVER                 
NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA WHILE THE NAM/GEM/WRF FAVOR A CENTRAL                    
MINNESOTA POSITION. THE UKMET IS A COMPROMISED SOLUTION. MODELS                 
FAVOR THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT...SO WILL FAVOR THE MORE PROGRESS                  
SOLUTIONS. THE MID LEVEL HIGH CONTINUES TO SLIDE DOWN THE ATLANTIC              
COAST WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS STRETCHES ACROSS THE THE FORECAST                 
AREA. MEANWHILE...THE MONTANA LOW WILL SPIN INTO SOUTHEAST MONTANA.             
SHORTWAVE SWEEPING THROUGH THE BASE OF THIS LOW WILL SAIL ACROSS THE            
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BECOME FOCUSED OVER CENTRAL                 
MINNESOTA WITH THE CANADIAN COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS NORTHERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR...AND THE PLAINS COLD FRONT DRAPED SOUTHWEST INTO THE             
EASTERN KANSAS. DEEP MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE DRAWN INTO THE                    
FORECAST AREA FEEDING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON                  
WEDNESDAY.                                                                      
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER MONTANA WILL SLIP INTO NORTH CENTRAL SOUTH               
DAKOTA WHILE THE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY                 
NIGHT. WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL TRACK THROUGH THE RIDGE OVER THE                    
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LIFT INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA               
DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. THE CANADIAN                    
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN STATIONARY OVER NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR.              
ISENTROPIC ASCENT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE A              
CHANCE OF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS SUGGEST             
THAT THE MOST UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE ALONG THE CANADIAN FRONTAL                   
SYSTEM.                                                                         
THE MID LEVEL LOW WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR KBIS...WITH A              
NUMBER OF WEAK SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW ON THURSDAY AND              
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW WILL ALSO BE PULLED NORTHWEST TO THE            
NORTH SIDE OF THE MID LEVEL LOW AND MOVE INTO NORTH CENTRAL NORTH               
DAKOTA. THE CANADIAN FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER CENTRAL                    
ONTARIO. A WEAK SHORTWAVE BEING EJECTED OUT AHEAD OF THE OF MID                 
LEVEL LOW WILL ATTEMPT TO TRAVERSE THE FORECAST AREA GENERATING A               
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS THE LOW BACKS WEST...THE                
ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL ALSO WEAKEN...BUT STILL APPEARS TO BE STRONG             
ENOUGH TO KEEP A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS GOING ESPECIALLY COUPLED               
WITH AFTERNOON HEATING. GUIDANCE SHOWING SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL BE             
HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE FOG OVER THE COOL WATERS OF LAKE SUPERIOR.               
THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY ALLOWING THE             
MID LEVEL LOW TO TREK EAST TO NEAR KJMS. THE SURFACE LOW WILL LINE              
UP WITH THE MID LEVEL LOW ALLOWING THE PLAINS FRONTAL SYSTEM TO MOVE            
INTO WESTERN IOWA. THE CANADIAN FRONT SYSTEM WILL LIKEWISE REMAIN               
WEAK AND OVER THE NORTHERN LAKE SUPERIOR. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS             
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REAL POSSIBILITY. CURRENT GRIDS LOOK OK FOR               
NOW.

MAIN FCST CONCERN IS POTENTIAL OF CONVECTION...MAINLY TUE AFTN.                 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A MIDLEVEL RIDGE                      
PROGRESSING E ACROSS THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND ONTARIO BTWN A            
COUPLE OF STRONG SHORTWAVES...ONE OVER THE NRN ROCKIES AND THE OTHER            
OVER QUEBEC. AT THE SFC...THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE IS SUPPORTING SFC HIGH             
PRES OVER THE CNTRL GREAT LAKES. RETURN FLOW ON BACKSIDE OF HIGH                
HAS RESULTED IN A BAND OF MID CLOUDS FROM NE MN ACROSS WRN UPPER MI             
INTO NRN WI. SHRA AND EVEN A FEW TSRA OVER CNTRL MN EARLIER TODAY               
HAVE LIFTED INTO THE ARROWHEAD OF MN AND HAVE WEAKENED. PCPN WAS                
OCCURRING ALONG A TIGHT GRADIENT OF 850MB THETA-E WHERE FAIRLY SHARP            
THETA-E ADVECTION WAS BEING MAXIMIZED. LOW-MID LEVEL FRONTOGENESIS              
WAS ALSO PLAYING A ROLE.                                                        
MIDLEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL DRIFT OVER UPPER MI TONIGHT WITH 500MB                 
HEIGHT RISES AROUND 30M. WITH HEIGHT RISES...NO SHORTWAVES MOVING               
ACROSS THE AREA AND NOSE OF LOW-LEVEL JET FOCUSING TO THE NW AND N              
OF FCST AREA...SEE LITTLE REASON TO INCLUDE POPS TONIGHT. AXIS OF               
LOW-LEVEL JET DOES SHIFT INTO WRN UPPER MI LATE WITH ELEVATED CAPE              
UPWARDS OF A COUPLE HUNDRED J/KG...WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISOLATED               
SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPING. FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE MENTION OUT AS GFS FCST              
SOUNDINGS INDICATE CIN WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT CONVECTION. AS             
FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE FOR SRLY FLOW...BEING                 
WARMEST W AROUND 60F AND COOLEST SE AROUND 50F.                                 
ON TUE...NAM/GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING MLCAPE INCREASING TO             
500 TO POSSIBLY UPWARDS OF 1000J/KG OVER ROUGHLY THE W HALF OF UPPER            
MI TO THE W OF THE AREA STABILIZED BY LAKE MICHIGAN MARINE LAYER IN             
SRLY FLOW. MODIFYING A FEW FCST SOUNDINGS OVER THE W FOR EXPECTED               
SFC T/TD AROUND 80/UPPER 50S YIELDS A LITTLE LESS SBCAPE THAN                   
MODEL MLCAPE. IN ANYCASE...LOOKS LIKE CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE              
FOR SOME AFTN CONVECTION. ATTM...COVERAGE LOOKS LIMITED BY LACK OF              
ANY SHORTWAVES OR OTHER FOCUSING MECHANISMS. SO...WILL RETAIN MID TO            
LOW RANGE CHC POPS MAINLY IN THE AFTN...ROUGHLY W OF A MENOMINEE TO             
MUNISING LINE. AREAS TO THE E SHOULD BE STABILIZED BY MARINE LAYER.             
WITH DEEP LAYER SHEAR IN THE 15-20KT RANGE...DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY              
SVR STORMS ATTM.                                                                
LONG TERM (TUE NIGHT THROUGH NEXT MON)...                                       
UNFORTUNATELY NOT MUCH TO TIE CHANCES OF PCPN THROUGH MUCH OF THIS              
PERIOD. SO...THE DREADED LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS                
EACH DAY IS THE WAY WE HAVE TO GO AT THIS POINT. IMAGINE WE WILL                
FIND SOME TIME FRAMES THAT WILL END UP MOSTLY DRY...BUT JUST TOO                
UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW TO TRY AND PIN THAT DOWN.                                   
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AND WEAKLY CAPPED ENVIRONMENT WILL PERSIST AT               
TIMES OVER CWA TUE NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST THU. UTILIZED CHANCE POPS             
WITH NO ATTEMPT AT TIMING AS SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE SHOWERS OR               
THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNTIL FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH            
THURSDAY. SW FLOW ALOFT AHEAD OF TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS WILL KEEP               
DEEP MOISTURE IN PLAY WITH PWATS RISING TO 150-200 PCT OF NORMAL.               
DID CONSIDER LOWERING POPS FOR WED AS INSTABILITY MINIMIZES DUE TO              
RATHER LARGE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS IN THE MID LEVELS. WARM FRONT WELL            
TO NORTH SHOULD BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR PCPN...BUT AS WINDS BECOME                
LIGHTER THROUGH THE DAY...STILL MAY SEE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION TO             
FORM ON LOCAL LK BREEZES. RAISED TEMPS TO AROUND 80 FOR MOST AREAS              
SINCE THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH CLOUD COVER. WED COULD BE QUITE A                
WARM AND HUMID DAY. DECENT AGREEMENT THAT FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP            
ACROSS NW CWA THU AFTN THEN THROUGH REST OF AREA THU NIGHT. UPPER               
FLOW IS MORE PARALLEL TO FRONT SO CANNOT SAY THE TIMING IS SOLID AT             
THIS POINT. ONCE FRONT MOVES THROUGH DRIER AIR BEGINS TO ADVECT IN              
FM ONTARIO WITH DEWPOINTS LOWERING BACK BLO 50F INSTEAD OF THE UPR              
50S TO AROUND 60 READINGS THAT WILL BE COMMON THROUGH THU OUT AHEAD             
OF THE FRONT.                                                                   
HAD TO KEEP PCPN IN GRIDS FRI/FRI NIGHT AS FRONT IS STILL CLOSE                 
ENOUGH TO THE EAST TO JUSTIFY. ALSO...GOOD AGREEMENT THAT WAVE OF               
LOW PRES DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT AND LIFTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF CWA FRI             
INTO SAT AND STALLS OUT INTO SAT NIGHT. THIS SLOWER TREND WITH RAIN             
CHANCES EXITING CWA...FIRST ONLY SHOWN BY GFS AND UKMET A COUPLE                
DAYS AGO...IS NOW APPEARING IN MAJORITY OF GUIDANCE AND ENSEMBLES               
...AND IS PREFERRED BY HPC. SO... KEPT POPS INTO SAT NIGHT FOR ALL              
CWA...THEN LINGERED A SLIGHT CHANCE OVR THE EAST CWA NEXT SUN.                  
EXPECT MON TO BE DRY AND A BIT COOLER IN WAKE OF TROUGH PASSAGE YET             
GFS INDICATES WARM AIR ADVECTION RAMPS UP AGAIN JUST SW OF HERE WITH            
SOME QPF GENERATED OVR MN INTO NORTHERN WI. SINCE MAIN BOUNDARY IS              
WELL TO THE SOUTH AT THAT POINT WILL KEEP IT DRY.                               
&&                                                                              
.MARINE (FOR 4 PM ISSUANCE OF LAKE SUPERIOR FCST)...                            
HIGH PRES OVER THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES WILL REACH THE MID ATLANTIC              
COAST BY TUE EVENING WHILE A LOW PRES TROF DRIFTS TO NW MN.                     
NOCTURNAL STRENGTHENING OF LOW-LEVEL JET BTWN THESE 2 SYSTEMS                   
TONIGHT WILL CAUSE A MODEST INCREASE IN SRLY WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF LAKE SUPERIOR...GENERALLY IN THE 15-20KT RANGE WITH 20-25KT AT               
TIMES ON HIGHER OBS PLATFORMS. OVER THE W HALF...SRLY WINDS ARE                 
ALWAYS LIGHTER THAN THE E HALF IN HIGHLY STABLE ENVIRONMENTS WITH               
WINDS TENDING TO REMAIN MORE BACKED TO AN ERLY DIRECTION...                     
ESPECIALLY NEAR THE MN SHORE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FCST. MORE               
THAN LIKELY...THESE CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST OVER THE W PORTION OF               
THE LAKE THRU TUE. ALTHOUGH WINDS MAY DIMINISH SLIGHTLY OVER ERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR TUE...WILL NEED TO WATCH AREAS CLOSE TO SHORE FROM                
PICTURED ROCKS EWD (ESPECIALLY GRAND MARAIS AREA) FOR HIGHER WINDS              
AS SRLY FLOW IS OFTEN ENHANCED BY THE TERRAIN THERE. WINDS WILL                 
TREND LIGHTER WED THRU THE END OF THE WEEK AS FRONTAL SYSTEM AND                
WEAK PRES GRADIENT SETTLE OVER THE AREA. FOG SHOULD BECOME AN ISSUE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT/TUE)...                                                    
MAIN FCST CONCERN IS POTENTIAL OF CONVECTION...MAINLY TUE AFTN.                 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A MIDLEVEL RIDGE                      
PROGRESSING E ACROSS THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND ONTARIO BTWN A            
COUPLE OF STRONG SHORTWAVES...ONE OVER THE NRN ROCKIES AND THE OTHER            
OVER QUEBEC. AT THE SFC...THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE IS SUPPORTING SFC HIGH             
PRES OVER THE CNTRL GREAT LAKES. RETURN FLOW ON BACKSIDE OF HIGH                
HAS RESULTED IN A BAND OF MID CLOUDS FROM NE MN ACROSS WRN UPPER MI             
INTO NRN WI. SHRA AND EVEN A FEW TSRA OVER CNTRL MN EARLIER TODAY               
HAVE LIFTED INTO THE ARROWHEAD OF MN AND HAVE WEAKENED. PCPN WAS                
OCCURRING ALONG A TIGHT GRADIENT OF 850MB THETA-E WHERE FAIRLY SHARP            
THETA-E ADVECTION WAS BEING MAXIMIZED. LOW-MID LEVEL FRONTOGENESIS              
WAS ALSO PLAYING A ROLE.                                                        
MIDLEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL DRIFT OVER UPPER MI TONIGHT WITH 500MB                 
HEIGHT RISES AROUND 30M. WITH HEIGHT RISES...NO SHORTWAVES MOVING               
ACROSS THE AREA AND NOSE OF LOW-LEVEL JET FOCUSING TO THE NW AND N              
OF FCST AREA...SEE LITTLE REASON TO INCLUDE POPS TONIGHT. AXIS OF               
LOW-LEVEL JET DOES SHIFT INTO WRN UPPER MI LATE WITH ELEVATED CAPE              
UPWARDS OF A COUPLE HUNDRED J/KG...WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISOLATED               
SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPING. FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE MENTION OUT AS GFS FCST              
SOUNDINGS INDICATE CIN WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT CONVECTION. AS             
FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE FOR SRLY FLOW...BEING                 
WARMEST W AROUND 60F AND COOLEST SE AROUND 50F.                                 
ON TUE...NAM/GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING MLCAPE INCREASING TO             
500 TO POSSIBLY UPWARDS OF 1000J/KG OVER ROUGHLY THE W HALF OF UPPER            
MI TO THE W OF THE AREA STABILIZED BY LAKE MICHIGAN MARINE LAYER IN             
SRLY FLOW. MODIFYING A FEW FCST SOUNDINGS OVER THE W FOR EXPECTED               
SFC T/TD AROUND 80/UPPER 50S YIELDS A LITTLE LESS SBCAPE THAN                   
MODEL MLCAPE. IN ANYCASE...LOOKS LIKE CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE              
FOR SOME AFTN CONVECTION. ATTM...COVERAGE LOOKS LIMITED BY LACK OF              
ANY SHORTWAVES OR OTHER FOCUSING MECHANISMS. SO...WILL RETAIN MID TO            
LOW RANGE CHC POPS MAINLY IN THE AFTN...ROUGHLY W OF A MENOMINEE TO             
MUNISING LINE. AREAS TO THE E SHOULD BE STABILIZED BY MARINE LAYER.             
WITH DEEP LAYER SHEAR IN THE 15-20KT RANGE...DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY              
SVR STORMS ATTM.                                                                
LONG TERM (TUE NIGHT THROUGH NEXT MON)...                                       
UNFORTUNATELY NOT MUCH TO TIE CHANCES OF PCPN THROUGH MUCH OF THIS              
PERIOD. SO...THE DREADED LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS                
EACH DAY IS THE WAY WE HAVE TO GO AT THIS POINT. IMAGINE WE WILL                
FIND SOME TIME FRAMES THAT WILL END UP MOSTLY DRY...BUT JUST TOO                
UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW TO TRY AND PIN THAT DOWN.                                   
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AND WEAKLY CAPPED ENVIRONMENT WILL PERSIST AT               
TIMES OVER CWA TUE NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST THU. UTILIZED CHANCE POPS             
WITH NO ATTEMPT AT TIMING AS SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE SHOWERS OR               
THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNTIL FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH            
THURSDAY. SW FLOW ALOFT AHEAD OF TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS WILL KEEP               
DEEP MOISTURE IN PLAY WITH PWATS RISING TO 150-200 PCT OF NORMAL.               
DID CONSIDER LOWERING POPS FOR WED AS INSTABILITY MINIMIZES DUE TO              
RATHER LARGE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS IN THE MID LEVELS. WARM FRONT WELL            
TO NORTH SHOULD BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR PCPN...BUT AS WINDS BECOME                
LIGHTER THROUGH THE DAY...STILL MAY SEE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION TO             
FORM ON LOCAL LK BREEZES. RAISED TEMPS TO AROUND 80 FOR MOST AREAS              
SINCE THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH CLOUD COVER. WED COULD BE QUITE A                
WARM AND HUMID DAY. DECENT AGREEMENT THAT FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP            
ACROSS NW CWA THU AFTN THEN THROUGH REST OF AREA THU NIGHT. UPPER               
FLOW IS MORE PARALLEL TO FRONT SO CANNOT SAY THE TIMING IS SOLID AT             
THIS POINT. ONCE FRONT MOVES THROUGH DRIER AIR BEGINS TO ADVECT IN              
FM ONTARIO WITH DEWPOINTS LOWERING BACK BLO 50F INSTEAD OF THE UPR              
50S TO AROUND 60 READINGS THAT WILL BE COMMON THROUGH THU OUT AHEAD             
OF THE FRONT.                                                                   
HAD TO KEEP PCPN IN GRIDS FRI/FRI NIGHT AS FRONT IS STILL CLOSE                 
ENOUGH TO THE EAST TO JUSTIFY. ALSO...GOOD AGREEMENT THAT WAVE OF               
LOW PRES DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT AND LIFTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF CWA FRI             
INTO SAT AND STALLS OUT INTO SAT NIGHT. THIS SLOWER TREND WITH RAIN             
CHANCES EXITING CWA...FIRST ONLY SHOWN BY GFS AND UKMET A COUPLE                
DAYS AGO...IS NOW APPEARING IN MAJORITY OF GUIDANCE AND ENSEMBLES               
...AND IS PREFERRED BY HPC. SO... KEPT POPS INTO SAT NIGHT FOR ALL              
CWA...THEN LINGERED A SLIGHT CHANCE OVR THE EAST CWA NEXT SUN.                  
EXPECT MON TO BE DRY AND A BIT COOLER IN WAKE OF TROUGH PASSAGE YET             
GFS INDICATES WARM AIR ADVECTION RAMPS UP AGAIN JUST SW OF HERE WITH            
SOME QPF GENERATED OVR MN INTO NORTHERN WI. SINCE MAIN BOUNDARY IS              
WELL TO THE SOUTH AT THAT POINT WILL KEEP IT DRY.                               
&&

HIGH PRES OVER THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES WILL REACH THE MID ATLANTIC              
COAST BY TUE EVENING WHILE A LOW PRES TROF DRIFTS TO NW MN.                     
NOCTURNAL STRENGTHENING OF LOW-LEVEL JET BTWN THESE 2 SYSTEMS                   
TONIGHT WILL CAUSE A MODEST INCREASE IN SRLY WINDS OVER THE E HALF              
OF LAKE SUPERIOR...GENERALLY IN THE 15-20KT RANGE WITH 20-25KT AT               
TIMES ON HIGHER OBS PLATFORMS. OVER THE W HALF...SRLY WINDS ARE                 
ALWAYS LIGHTER THAN THE E HALF IN HIGHLY STABLE ENVIRONMENTS WITH               
WINDS TENDING TO REMAIN MORE BACKED TO AN ERLY DIRECTION...                     
ESPECIALLY NEAR THE MN SHORE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FCST. MORE               
THAN LIKELY...THESE CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST OVER THE W PORTION OF               
THE LAKE THRU TUE. ALTHOUGH WINDS MAY DIMINISH SLIGHTLY OVER ERN

PICTURED ROCKS EWD (ESPECIALLY GRAND MARAIS AREA) FOR HIGHER WINDS              
AS SRLY FLOW IS OFTEN ENHANCED BY THE TERRAIN THERE. WINDS WILL                 
TREND LIGHTER WED THRU THE END OF THE WEEK AS FRONTAL SYSTEM AND

THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS THE POTENTIAL                    
THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY.                                                       
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC SHOW A CLOSED LOW JUST SOUTHEAST OF                 
JAMES BAY...A BROAD RIDGE OVER MANITOBA...AND ANOTHER CLOSED LOW                
OVER SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON STATE. WEAK SHORTWAVES ARE WORKING THROUGH            
THE RIDGE AND ARE OVER EASTERN U.P...THE LAKE OF THE WOOD AREA OF               
MINNESOTA...AND OVER SOUTHWEST MANITOBA. SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A             
LOW OVER CENTRAL QUEBEC...WITH A FRONTAL SYSTEM STRETCHING FROM IT              
THROUGH THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO A LOW OVER NORTHEAST WYOMING.                  
ANOTHER LOW IS OVER CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN. A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE IS               
OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES AND WESTERN ONTARIO.                                 
THE MID LEVEL LOW OVER WESTERN QUEBEC WILL MOVE TO EAST CENTRAL                 
QUEBEC...THE RIDGE OVER MANITOBA WILL MOVE TO WESTERN ONTARIO...AND             
THE LOW OVER WASHINGTON WILL CLIMB INTO THE SASKATCHEWAN TODAY. THE             
SHORTWAVE OVER EASTERN U.P. WILL RACE THROUGH THE LOWER GREAT LAKES             
WHILE THE LAKE OF THE WOODS SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE WESTERN U.P.               
MEANWHILE...THE SURFACE HIGH OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT              
OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES. THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY FRONTAL SYSTEM

CONDITIONS EXIST. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS LARGE UPPER LOW CENTERED               
ACROSS SOUTHERN ONTARIO. THE MAIN SHORT TERM FORECAST CONCERN IS                
CLOUD COVER TONIGHT.                                                            
LARGE UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MEANDER OFF TO THE EAST NORTHEAST              
TONIGHT. WRAP AROUND CLOUDS ARE FINALLY FILTERING INTO THE REGION               
FROM THE NORTHWEST (A LITTLE BEHIND SCHEDULE). MODELS CONTINUE THIS             
PROCESS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON INTO EARLY THIS EVENING              
BEFORE DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN OVERNIGHT. THEREFORE...CONTINUED MOSTLY             
CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS EASTERN UPPER (MEAN 900-700 MB RH ABOUT 90                  
PERCENT) AND BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY NORTH OF M-72 IN NORTHERN LOWER             
(MEAN 900-700 MB RH 70 TO 80 PERCENT) AND PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTHERN                
ZONES (MEAN 900-700 MB RH ONLY 50 TO 60 PERCENT). OVERNIGHT...MEAN              
900-700 MB RH DROPS OFF BY ABOUT 20 PERCENT OR SO...WHICH SHOULD BE             
ENOUGH TO SCATTER OUT CLOUDS IN THE NORTH AND LEAD TO MOSTLY CLEAR              
CONDITIONS SOUTH. WINDS WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH TONIGHT BUT NOT TOTALLY            
DECOUPLE (REMAIN BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MPH) WHICH SHOULD LIMIT FROST                 
POTENTIAL. STILL PRETTY CHILLY WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER              
40S EXPECTED.                                                                   
MEMORIAL DAY...IT LOOKS LIKE A GLORIOUS MEMORIAL DAY IS ON TAP.                 
RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST. VERY DRY              
AIR ADVECTS IN FROM THE WEST WITH MEAN 900-700 MB RH FALLING FROM               
BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT IN THE MORNING TO BETWEEN 20 AND 30                   
PERCENT IN THE AFTERNOON. THEREFORE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN THE                  
MORNING SHOULD GIVE WAY TO A MAINLY SUNNY AFTERNOON. HIGHS TOPPING              
OUT IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S. WESTERLY WINDS WILL BE IN THE 5             
TO 10 MPH RANGE.

LATER PERIODS...AMPLIFYING TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS...AND                
RIDGE ALONG THE EAST COAST WILL ALLOW MUCH WARMER CONDITIONS THROUGH            
MIDWEEK WITH PRECIPITATION ALSO RETURNING FOR MID WEEK AS NORTHERN              
PLAINS TROUGH SLOWLY TRAVERSES EASTWARD INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES            
REGION.                                                                         
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...AMPLIFYING TROUGH ACROSS THE HIGH                    
PLAINS...AND RIDGE ACROSS THE EAST WILL ALLOW RETURN FLOW TO DEVELOP            
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR MILDER                   
TEMPERATURES FOR THIS PERIOD. AS IS TYPICALLY THE CASE IN NORTHERN              
MICHIGAN...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN WILL BE VERY SLOW. THIS SLOW               
MOISTURE RETURN WILL HOLD OFF ANY PRECIPITATION UNTIL AT LEAST                  
TUESDAY AFTERNOON. MOISTURE MAY BE SUFFICIENT SOUTH OF M-72 BY LATE             
AFTERNOON TO GENERATE SOME PRECIPITATION. ALSO...PARTLY SUNNY SKIES             
EXPECTED TUESDAY AFTERNOON...WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE SOME SURFACE              
INSTABILITY. THUS...WILL THROW IN A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH OF            
M-72 FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT WILL REMAIN IN THE                
40S...AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS UP AND MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS BEGIN TO             
SPREAD INTO THE AREA. HIGHS TUESDAY AFTERNOON WILL REACH WELL INTO              
THE 70S...APPROACHING 80 IN A FEW LOCATIONS.                                    
TUESDAY NIGHT...EXPECT A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO PERSIST               
INTO THE EVENING HOURS WITH THE SURFACE INSTABILITY.  HOWEVER...ONCE            
WE LOSE THE SUN...PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TO DIMINISH. WILL KEEP A            
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN FOR ALL LOCATIONS UNTIL                  
MIDNIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ACTIVITY. AFTER MIDNIGHT...MAY SEE SOME            
ACTIVITY MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST...SO WILL KEEP A CHANCE               
ACROSS THE WEST.  WITH CLOUD COVER AND STRONGER WINDS...TEMPERATURES            
WILL ONLY FALL INTO THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 50S.                                    
EXTENDED (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WITH AMPLIFIED TROUGH TAKING            
UP RESIDENCE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WILL HAVE A FAIRLY ACTIVE              
PERIOD OF WEATHER THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE            
INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES ON BY LATE WEDNESDAY...WITH A TRAILING             
FRONT BACK INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...KEEPING THE SURGE OF WARMTH AND            
MOISTURE ONGOING. HIGHS FOR WEDNESDAY WILL AGAIN REACH INTO THE                 
MIDDLE TO UPPER 70S WITH SOME 80S POSSIBLE. BY WEDNESDAY                        
AFTERNOON...SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE IN PLACE TO GENERATE SOME               
SHOWERS AND STORMS. HOWEVER...WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOME CLOUD              
COVER FROM CONVECTION OUT WEST THAT MAY POTENTIALLY LIMIT LOW LEVEL             
INSTABILITY TO POP SOME ACTIVITY. THEN AGAIN...WE WILL GET SOME                 
SHOWER/STORMS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM WISCONSIN DURING THE                   
DAY...TO WARRANT GOING WITH LIKELY POPS. ANY SFC HEATING WOULD BE A             
BONUS. WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS FRONT IS STILL             
IN THE AREA AND WILL HAVE PRECIP LINGERING INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.            
PRECIP CHANCES CONTINUE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS MID/UPPER LEVEL                  
TROUGH REMAINS OVER THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES...SO SCATTERED SHOWERS              
AND THUNDERSTORMS SEEM REASONABLE. GFS/ECMWF VARY QUITE A BIT FOR               
THE WEEKEND...WITH THE GFS KEEPING THE TROUGH AROUND THE GREAT                  
LAKES...AND ECMWF HAS THE TROUGH LIFTING AND RIDGING ENTERING THE

MODEL RUNS HANDLE THIS TROUGH. TEMPERATURES FOR THURSDAY ONWARD WILL            
BE ON THE COOLER SIDE WITH 60S TO LOWER 70S FOR HIGHS WITH THE

SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE THIS                     
AFTERNOON...AS MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE VORTEX LIFTS FROM EASTERN                   
NEBRASKA/SOUTH DAKOTA INTO CENTRAL MINNESOTA. HIGHEST THREAT                    
LOCALLY FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING APPEARS TO              
BE ACROSS WEST CENTRAL MN...ROUGHLY FROM ALEXANDRIA TO MONTEVIDEO

AND MCV...WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO SNEAK INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA AT                
20Z. WILL NEED TO MONITOR THE EXTREME NORTHWESTERN CWA CLOSELY FOR              
NON-SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS...AS 20Z RUC/LAPS BOTH HIGHLIGHTED                 
THAT AREA WITH A CORRELATED POCKET OF ENHANCED 0-3KM MLCAPE AND

OF SURFACE THETA E CONVERGENCE...PER 20Z LAPS DATA. MID LEVEL                   
LAPSE RATES ARE MARGINAL /AROUND 6.5 C/KM/ SO EXPECT ANY HAIL TO                
HAVE A HARD TIME REACHING SEVERE CRITERIA. THE SEVERE THREAT                    
DIMINISHES WITH EASTWARD PROGRESSION ACROSS THE CWA...WHERE LOWER

ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIAL DIVERGENCE COUPLET IS PROGGED TO SET UP                 
OVER THE CENTRAL/EASTERN DAKOTAS...SO ANTICIPATE THE EXCESSIVE RAINFALL         
TO OCCUR WEST OF THE CWA. STILL EXPECT IT TO BE A GOOD

MN /WHERE PWATS ARE AROUND 1.5 INCHES/.                                         
THE BLOCKING INFLUENCE OF THE STRONG EASTERN CONUS RIDGE WILL                   
CAUSE THE UPPER LOW TO MAKE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EASTWARD

.SYNOPSIS...HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WILL CONTINUE            
TO RIDGE INTO THE CAROLINAS THROUGH TONIGHT. A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT             
WILL APPROACH NORTHEASTERN NC ON TUESDAY.

RIDGING ALOFT AND AT THE SURFACE WILL RESULT IN ANOTHER HOT AND                 
DRY DAY ACROSS CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA. THE 1000-850 MB THICKNESS FROM           
GSO THIS MORNING OF 1392M IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PAST TWO                   
MORNINGS. THEREFORE...TEMPS SHOULD BE VERY CLOSE TO THOSE OF THE                
PAST TWO DAYS. A DEGREE OR TWO MORE COULD BE SEEN IN SOME LOCATIONS             
AS THE LATEST RUC AND NAM GUIDANCE SUGGEST A FEW METERS RISE IN                 
LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES THIS AFTERNOON AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.             
THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS AND NO CHANGES ARE               
NEEDED.                                                                         
PERIODS OF HIGH CIRRUS WILL PASS THROUGH THE AREA TODAY...VARYING               
THE SKY BETWEEN MOSTLY SUNNY AND PARTLY SUNNY. SOME DIURNAL CUMULUS             
ARE POSSIBLE...BUT THE ATMOSPHERE HAS NOT MOISTENED UP MUCH IN THE              
PAST FEW DAYS...SO WE ARE NOT EXPECTING AN EXPANSIVE CU FIELD TODAY.            
NO UPDATE TO THE ZONE FORECAST WILL BE NEEDED. THE GRIDS WILL BE                
UPDATED SLIGHTLY TO REFLECT CURRENT TEMP AND DEWPOINT TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...                                
RIDGE WEAKENS A BIT AND SHIFTS WESTWARD TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. THIS               
ALLOWS A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT TO SLIP SOUTH ACROSS THE MID ATLANTIC AND         
THEN STALL ACROSS NE NC ON TUESDAY. ORIENTATION OF THE FRONT                    
SHIFTS FROM WEST TO EAST TO MORE NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST AS THE                  
MAIN PUSH BEHIND THE FRONT DRIVES S JUST OFF THE COAST.                         
MOS NUMBERS INDICATE LITTLE CHANCE OF PRECIP ACROSS NE AND E ZONES              
ON TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 21Z SREF SUGGEST CHANCE POPS MAY BE               
WARRANTED FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS              
OF INSTABILITY AND CONVERGENCE...WILL ADD SLIGHT CHC POPS TO NE                 
ZONES ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MAX TEMPS SHOULD BE A                   
DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN PREVIOUS DAYS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NE                  
ZONES.                                                                          
FRONT WASHES OUT A BIT ON WEDNESDAY AND SUPPORT FOR CONVECTION                  
DIMINISHES. INCREASING MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER RESULT IN MAX TEMPS             
IN THE UPPER 80S ON WEDNESDAY.

.AVIATION /14Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...                                        
VFR CONDITIONS FOR THE TAF PERIOD. HIGH PRESSURE OFFSHORE WILL                  
PROVIDE A LIGHT SOUTHERLY WIND. AFTERNOON CUMULUS WITH BASES AROUND             
6000 FEET WILL QUICKLY DISSIPATE BY SUNSET WITH SKIES MAINLY

.SYNOPSIS...A SFC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM HAS NOW SHIFTED OFFSHORE                 
OF THE SC WATERS WITH WEAK ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUING. AS MENTIONED                
IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...LOW LEVELS ARE DRIER AS EVIDENT FROM 00Z               
SOUNDING WITH PWAT NEAR 0.92. LARGE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AT 500 MB            
IS NOTED IN RUC ANALYSIS AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY FROM FL TO THE                 
OHIO VALLEY. AREAS OF FOG EXPECTED MAINLY OVER GA ZONES THROUGH                 
EARLY MORNING.                                                                  
.SHORT TERM...MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN SHOWING LOW PWATS TODAY MAINLY              
AROUND 0.75 INCHES ACROSS THE AREA WITH MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY                  
SUNNY SKIES WITH SOME CU DEVELOPMENT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS PREVIOUS                
DAYS. SCT-BKN HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE AS UPPER TROUGH OVER THE              
NRN GULF OF MEXICO MOVES EWD. HIGHS REBOUND FROM MORNING LOWS IN                
THE 60S TO AROUND 90 INLAND AND LOWER 80S AT THE COAST. LOWS                    
TONIGHT EXPECTED TO BE MAINLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S WITH PATCHY               
FOG POSSIBLE OVER NE ZONES. THURSDAY...MODELS IN AGREEMENT                      
INDICATING A SWATH OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER MOISTURE MOVING INTO THE                  
REGION FROM THE ATLANTIC BY THURSDAY MORNING WITH THE POSSIBILITY               
AGAIN OF ISOLD SMALL SHOWERS DURING THE DAY. LITTLE CHANGE TO HIGH              
TEMPS FROM WED. EYES SHIFT SWD AS NWP MODELS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A              
TROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE SRN GULF OF MEXICO NEAR THE YUCATAN. GFS                 
SEEMS TOO AGGRESSIVE AND IS PLAGUED WITH CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK AS IT              
MOVES THE SYSTEM NNE TOWARD THE FL PANHANDLE LATE SAT. NAM IS MORE              
REASONABLE BUT PROBABLY TOO DEEP WITH PRESSURES. ONLY MINOR                     
CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE CURRENT FORECAST ON FRIDAY WITH ONLY 20%               
FOR THE FL ZONES WITH ONLY SHOWER ACTIVITY AS INSTABILITY SEEMS A               
WEAK FOR THUNDERSTORMS.

TROUGH OVER THE ERN GULF AND SFC LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING OUT OF              
THE YUCATAN STRAIT. BASED ON THIS SCENARIO N-S POP GRADIENT IS                  
PLANNED WITH AROUND 30-40% S ZONES AND 20-30% N. GENERALLY USED A               
BLEND OF PREVIOUS FORECAST AND LATEST GFS RUN FOR THE POPS AND                  
TEMPS. CONFIDENCE IS LOW SAT-SUN DUE TO MODEL DISAGREEMENT AND A                
NUMBER OF CHANGES WILL OCCUR WITH THE FORECAST. HOWEVER...BY EARLY              
MON MOST NWP GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THE LOW MOVING INTO THE WRN ATLC

THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY HIGHLIGHT THE FORECAST CONCERNS.                     
TODAY AND TONIGHT...CURRENT RADAR TRENDS INDICATE SQUALL LINE IS                
DYING OUT ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL KS WITH WEAK CELLULAR CONVECTION                 
MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN CWA AT FORECAST TIME.  UPPER LEVEL TROUGH             
AND JET STREAM IN ITS AXIS REMAIN OVER EASTERN CO AT FORECAST TIME.             
NAM AND RUC INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY FOR SOME CONVECTION TO                     
REDEVELOP BEHIND THE DYING SQUALL LINE THIS MORNING SO WILL LEAVE               
FLASH FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FOR NOW.  DAY SHIFT CAN REEVALUATE THE              
LIKELIHOOD OF THIS REDEVELOPMENT BASED ON RADAR TRENDS AND MAKE A               
DECISION ON THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES              
NEAR 1.5 INCHES IT REMAINS POSSIBLE FOR CONVECTION TO DUMP RAINFALL             
RATES UP TO AN INCH PER HOUR...WHICH WOULD QUICKLY APPROACH OR                  
EXCEED FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH CENTRAL KS.  AS THE            
UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS THIS ENERGY WILL PUSH A COLD                 
FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING THROUGH THE EVENING                
HOURS SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR REDEVELOPING PRECIPITATION.  WITH A                
STRATUS DECK AHEAD OF THIS FRONT SURFACE HEATING WILL BE                        
LIMITED...MAKING SEVERE WEATHER LESS LIKELY ALONG THE FRONT.  THE               
MAIN HAZARD ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN THE FORM OF            
HEAVY RAIN WITH THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATING A TROPICAL SIGNAL             
TO THE AIRMASS.  DUE TO HIGHER FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES EAST OF              
THE CURRENT WATCH AREA...WIDESPREAD FLASH FLOODING DOES NOT SEEM                
LIKELY...HOWEVER LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL PRODUCING FLOODING CANNOT BE            
RULED OUT.  THE MODELS ARE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT IN BRINGING THE                
FRONT SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 06Z...AND THIS                  
SHOULD AT LEAST TEMPORARILY END PRECIPITATION.  TRIED TO MATCH POPS             
WHERE THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE TODAY THROUGH THIS EVENING.  HAVE             
CATEGORICAL POPS GOING ALONG THE FRONT.  BROUGHT POPS TO AN END                 
AFTER 12Z.                                                                      
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...JET STREAM LOOKS TO REMAIN OVER THE                   
CENTRAL ROCKIES BRINGING GOOD CYCLOGENESIS TO THE TX/OK PANHANDLES              
AGAIN.  THIS WILL BEGIN TO LIFT THE COLD FRONT FROM WEST TO EAST                
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.  BECAUSE OF THIS THERE IS A CHANCE THAT               
BETWEEN ISENTROPIC LIFT AND ANY EMBEDDED SPEED MAX IN THE UPPER                 
LEVEL FLOW THAT A THUNDERSTORM WILL DEVELOP OVER NORTH CENTRAL KS               
THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  FOR THE REST OF THE CWA A RELATIVELY STABLE                
AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD ALLOW FOR AT LEAST PARTY             
CLOUDY SKIES AND THEREFORE SOME SUNSHINE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  AS THE            
FRONT LIFTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT THE                  
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL INCREASE AS THE RETURN                
FLOW RIDING OVER THE BOUNDARY IS MORE LIKELY TO OVERCOME THE CAP AND            
ALLOW SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.              
NAM AND GFS HAVE ALSO DISPLAYED SOME RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IN                  
BRINGING A VORT MAX AROUND THE UPPER LOW FRIDAY MORNING...ENHANCING             
CONFIDENCE IN PRECIPITATION WITH THE RETREATING FRONT.  WITH THE                
FRONT RETREATING THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THEN THE POTENTIAL VORT MAX               
MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL PLAINS FRIDAY MORNING INTO FRIDAY                    
AFTERNOON HAVE GONE WITH MID TO UPPER CHANCE POPS (40-50 PERCENT)               
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE CWA.  THE MODELS             
HAVE BEEN HINTING AT AN MCS DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL KS THURSDAY                 
NIGHT AND MOVING EAST ALONG THE RETREATING FRONT FRIDAY MORNING.                
WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW AT THE LOW LEVELS AND AN EXITING JET STREAK                 
BRINGING FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT OVER CENTRAL KS THURSDAY                 
NIGHT THIS IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.  ANY ORGANIZED CONVECTION                
WILL BRING ABOUT THE CHANCE FOR SOME SEVERE WEATHER AND MORE LIKELY             
HEAVY RAINFALL.  AT THIS TIME THE DETAILS ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET            
WITHOUT KNOWING FOR SURE HOW FAR SOUTHEAST THE FRONT WILL SLIDE.                
ONCE THIS IS DETERMINED IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO PLACE AN AREA MORE               
FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE WEATHER.  THE PLACEMENT OF THE SECONDARY UPPER             
LEVEL JET STREAK/VORT MAX WILL ALSO LARGELY DETERMINE AREAS OF                  
FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZED CONVECTION.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ONCE AGAIN.  NOT                
REAL CONFIDENT IN THIS SOLUTION AT THIS TIME AS THERE IS NO OBVIOUS             
FEATURE UPSTREAM THAT FAVORS MOVING THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OFF TO THE              
EAST AS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE SITS OVER THE ROCKIES.  AT THIS

.UPDATED DISCUSSION...                                                          
UPPER LEVEL ENERGY ENTERING THE CENTRAL PLAINS HAS NOT KEPT MUCH                
PRECIPITATION GOING AS WAS ANTICIPATED WITH THE INITIAL FORECAST                
PACKAGE.  THE MAIN COLD FRONT REMAINS WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA SO              
HAVE NOT DOWNPLAYED POPS TOO MUCH YET AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS              
MAY DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  THE CHANCES FOR                        
THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING LOOK SMALL HOWEVER AND HAVE GONE WITH                
RAIN SHOWER WORDING WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONVEY THIS.                 
WITH LITTLE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING THERE IS NOT MUCH              
OF A FLASH FLOOD THREAT LEFT ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL KANSAS...SO HAVE              
ALSO GONE AHEAD AND CANCELLED THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH THIS MORNING.               
IF PRECIPITATION DOES NOT DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT AT ALL TODAY                  
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL HAVE TO BE MADE TO THE GOING                           
FORECAST...HOWEVER RUC/NAM/GFS ALL INDICATE THAT PRECIPITATION WILL             
REDEVELOP ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...SO HAVE NOT MADE SWEEPING                
CHANGES REDUCING POPS AT THIS TIME.

SHORT TERM PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND AMOUNTS TODAY...AND THEN AGAIN             
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY HIGHLIGHT THE FORECAST CONCERNS.                     
TODAY AND TONIGHT...CURRENT RADAR TRENDS INDICATE SQUALL LINE IS                
DYING OUT ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL KS WITH WEAK CELLULAR CONVECTION                 
MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN CWA AT FORECAST TIME.  UPPER LEVEL TROUGH             
AND JET STREAM IN ITS AXIS REMAIN OVER EASTERN CO AT FORECAST TIME.             
NAM AND RUC INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY FOR SOME CONVECTION TO                     
REDEVELOP BEHIND THE DYING SQUALL LINE THIS MORNING SO WILL LEAVE               
FLASH FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FOR NOW.  DAY SHIFT CAN REEVALUATE THE              
LIKELIHOOD OF THIS REDEVELOPMENT BASED ON RADAR TRENDS AND MAKE A               
DECISION ON THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES              
NEAR 1.5 INCHES IT REMAINS POSSIBLE FOR CONVECTION TO DUMP RAINFALL             
RATES UP TO AN INCH PER HOUR...WHICH WOULD QUICKLY APPROACH OR                  
EXCEED FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH CENTRAL KS.  AS THE            
UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS THIS ENERGY WILL PUSH A COLD                 
FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING THROUGH THE EVENING                
HOURS SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR REDEVELOPING PRECIPITATION.  WITH A                
STRATUS DECK AHEAD OF THIS FRONT SURFACE HEATING WILL BE                        
LIMITED...MAKING SEVERE WEATHER LESS LIKELY ALONG THE FRONT.  THE               
MAIN HAZARD ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN THE FORM OF            
HEAVY RAIN WITH THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATING A TROPICAL SIGNAL             
TO THE AIRMASS.  DUE TO HIGHER FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES EAST OF              
THE CURRENT WATCH AREA...WIDESPREAD FLASH FLOODING DOES NOT SEEM                
LIKELY...HOWEVER LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL PRODUCING FLOODING CANNOT BE            
RULED OUT.  THE MODELS ARE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT IN BRINGING THE                
FRONT SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 06Z...AND THIS                  
SHOULD AT LEAST TEMPORARILY END PRECIPITATION.  TRIED TO MATCH POPS             
WHERE THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE TODAY THROUGH THIS EVENING.  HAVE             
CATEGORICAL POPS GOING ALONG THE FRONT.  BROUGHT POPS TO AN END                 
AFTER 12Z.                                                                      
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...JET STREAM LOOKS TO REMAIN OVER THE                   
CENTRAL ROCKIES BRINGING GOOD CYCLOGENESIS TO THE TX/OK PANHANDLES              
AGAIN.  THIS WILL BEGIN TO LIFT THE COLD FRONT FROM WEST TO EAST                
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.  BECAUSE OF THIS THERE IS A CHANCE THAT               
BETWEEN ISENTROPIC LIFT AND ANY EMBEDDED SPEED MAX IN THE UPPER                 
LEVEL FLOW THAT A THUNDERSTORM WILL DEVELOP OVER NORTH CENTRAL KS               
THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  FOR THE REST OF THE CWA A RELATIVELY STABLE                
AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD ALLOW FOR AT LEAST PARTY             
CLOUDY SKIES AND THEREFORE SOME SUNSHINE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  AS THE            
FRONT LIFTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT THE                  
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL INCREASE AS THE RETURN                
FLOW RIDING OVER THE BOUNDARY IS MORE LIKELY TO OVERCOME THE CAP AND            
ALLOW SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.              
NAM AND GFS HAVE ALSO DISPLAYED SOME RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IN                  
BRINGING A VORT MAX AROUND THE UPPER LOW FRIDAY MORNING...ENHANCING             
CONFIDENCE IN PRECIPITATION WITH THE RETREATING FRONT.  WITH THE                
FRONT RETREATING THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THEN THE POTENTIAL VORT MAX               
MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL PLAINS FRIDAY MORNING INTO FRIDAY                    
AFTERNOON HAVE GONE WITH MID TO UPPER CHANCE POPS (40-50 PERCENT)               
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE CWA.  THE MODELS             
HAVE BEEN HINTING AT AN MCS DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL KS THURSDAY                 
NIGHT AND MOVING EAST ALONG THE RETREATING FRONT FRIDAY MORNING.                
WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW AT THE LOW LEVELS AND AN EXITING JET STREAK                 
BRINGING FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT OVER CENTRAL KS THURSDAY                 
NIGHT THIS IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.  ANY ORGANIZED CONVECTION                
WILL BRING ABOUT THE CHANCE FOR SOME SEVERE WEATHER AND MORE LIKELY             
HEAVY RAINFALL.  AT THIS TIME THE DETAILS ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET            
WITHOUT KNOWING FOR SURE HOW FAR SOUTHEAST THE FRONT WILL SLIDE.                
ONCE THIS IS DETERMINED IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO PLACE AN AREA MORE               
FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE WEATHER.  THE PLACEMENT OF THE SECONDARY UPPER             
LEVEL JET STREAK/VORT MAX WILL ALSO LARGELY DETERMINE AREAS OF                  
FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZED CONVECTION.                         
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...UKMET AND GFS INDICATE THE UPPER LEVEL              
LOW TRACKING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE PERIOD...SENDING THE               
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ONCE AGAIN.  NOT                
REAL CONFIDENT IN THIS SOLUTION AT THIS TIME AS THERE IS NO OBVIOUS             
FEATURE UPSTREAM THAT FAVORS MOVING THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OFF TO THE              
EAST AS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE SITS OVER THE ROCKIES.  AT THIS                
TIME HAVE MATCHED UP WITH NEIGHBORS AND PLACED CHANCE POPS IN THIS              
PERIOD WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

WITH LACK OF CONVECTION MOVING INTO THE AREA ATTM...LOWER CIGS                  
AROUND A THOUSAND FEET LOOK MORE LIKELY IN THE SHORTER TERM. BETTER             
CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WOULD APPEAR TO HOLD OFF UNTIL ARRIVAL OF                
BETTER UPPER AIR SUPPORT...I.E. LATER THIS AFTERNOON. SFC BOUNDARY              
THEN MOVES THROUGH DURING AFTN AND EVENING LIFTING CIGS AND BRINGING            
END TO TSTMS. BY EARLY THURSDAY, WE MAY BE PRONE TO SOME FOG WITH               
GOOD RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND VERY LIGHT LOW LEVEL WINDS. LATER

.UPDATE...MODELS ARE NOT HANDLING THE EVOLUTION OF DERECHO MOVING               
SOUTHEAST AROUND 35 MPH THROUGH NORTH TEXAS ATTM VERY WELL. 12Z GFS             
DOES NOT SHOW THE ORGANIZED COMPLEX NEAR DALLAS WHILE THE 12Z NAM               
DEVELOPS AN AREA OF CONVECTION NEAR COLLEGE STATION AROUND 18Z                  
AND MOVES IT RAPIDLY SOUTH-SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA                  
THIS AFTERNOON. THE RUC/NGM SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THE                
CURRENT PRECIP AREAS WHICH IS A BIT UNSETTLING BECAUSE THESE MODELS             
TYPICALLY OVER OVERDONE WITH RESPECT TO QPF IN SOUTH TEXAS. THE                 
CURRENT MOVEMENT WOULD BRING COMPLEX INTO SOUTHEAST TEXAS AROUND                
21Z. MOST OF SOUTH TEXAS SHOULD BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF                       
STRENGTHENING INVERSION. BUT VICTORIA CROSSROADS REGION MAY SEE                 
A CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT AS LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE                  
INCREASES WITH THE APPROACH OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM COMPLEX TO                 
THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND THE DEVELOPING SEABREEZE. WILL PUT IN A

END WITHIN THE NEXT 1-2 HOURS ACROSS WEBB COUNTY.  OTHERWISE...A                
CONTINUED DRY FCST IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE FCST PD AS WIDESPREAD                
SUBSIDENCE CONTINUES WITH A DRY NWLY FLOW ALOFT.  VERY MARGINAL

.UPDATE...HAVE UPDATED FORECAST TO REMOVE POPS TO THE SOUTHWEST                 
FOR THE DAY AS THIS AREA IS IN THE MUCH STRONGER CAP AND DOUBT                  
ANYTHING WILL DEVELOP SOUTHWEST OF A STERLING CITY TO SAN ANGELO                
TO SAN SABA LINE. ALSO PUSHED BACK TIMING OF THUNDERSTORM                       
DEVELOPMENT TO THE NORTHWEST OF THAT LINE TIL AFTER 21Z AS WE HAVE              
TO WEAKEN THE CAP AND GET THE FRONT A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE SOUTH               
FOR BETTER CONVERGENCE. IF THUNDERSTORMS DO GET GOING THIS                      
AFTERNOON...RUC FORECAST CAPES TO BE 4 TO 6 THOUSAND J/KG AND                   
STORMS WILL LIKELY BE SEVERE. SO WENT AHEAD AND MENTIONED SEVERE                
FOR THIS AFTERNOON WHERE WE THINK STORMS WILL DEVELOP. ALSO                     
COOLED TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE BIG COUNTRY...WHERE CLOUDS AND                   
OUTFLOWS AND SOME FRONTAL EFFECTS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A LITTLE               
COOLER. FURTHER TO THE SOUTH WHERE THE STRONG CAP IS IN PLACE AND               
LESS EFFECTS FROM CLOUDS...OUTFLOWS AND FRONT...HAVE INCREASED                  
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE. UPDATES TO FLY SOON.

COLD FRONT SOUTH OF AMARILLO AT 3 AM LIKELY TO MOVE SOUTH                       
INTO THE BIG COUNTRY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE...WITH A EXTRA              
PUSH FROM OUTFLOW FROM STRONG/SEVERE STORMS MOVING INTO WESTERN                 
OKLAHOMA. WITH WRF SB CAPES OF 4000 J/KG BY MID AFTERNOON IN THE

SEVERE IN BIG COUNTRY ZONES TONIGHT. WRF MODEL HANGS UP FRONT                   
ALONG I-20 TONIGHT...BEFORE LIFTING NORTH FRIDAY...BUT ACTUAL                   
POSITION DEPENDS ON CONVECTION AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT MAY

THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING IN CROCKETT COUNTY AND THE WESTERN CONCHO               
VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON...THEN MOVE EAST IN THE EVENING. THIS A

300-250MB JET ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS TROUGH 10-

NAM/GFS RUNS VERIFIED QUITE WELL ACROSS NOAM...WHILE THE 28/00Z RUNS            
WERE TOO WEAK/PROGRESSIVE WITH THE NORTHERN PLAINS TROUGH. THRU                 
36HRS MODELS HAVE CONVERGED ON A COMPROMISE OF THEIR PREVIOUS RUNS.             
GFS SHOWS THE BETTER RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY WITH ITS 29/00Z RUN. FOR            
36-60HRS MODELS CONTINUE TO CONVERGE ON A COMPROMISE OF THEIR                   
EARLIER RUNS. FOR 60-84HRS THE TREND IS A BIT SLOWER...MORE CLOSED              
500MB LOW THAN THE EARLIER GFS RUNS...BUT GFS OTHERWISE OFFERS                  
REASONABLE RUN-TO-RUN CONTINUITY. CHECK OF OBS VS. MODEL DATA AT 06Z            
SHOWED BOTH NAM/GFS WITH GOOD DEPICTIONS OF THE SFC MASS FIELDS...              
WITH EDGE TO NAM ON SFC DEW POINTS ACROSS THE CENTRAL CONUS. PER WV             
IMAGERY...GFS LOOKED BETTER WITH ITS STRONGER SHORTWAVE OVER UT/                
WESTERN CO...BUT APPEARED TO SUFFER CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK WITH A                  
SHORTWAVE OVER WESTERN NEB. NAM LOOKED BETTER HERE INTO EASTERN MT/             
SOUTHERN SASKAT. A NAM/GFS COMPROMISE LOOKED BEST WITH THE 00Z-06Z              
PRECIP ACROSS THE CONUS...AS WAS THE CASE FOR 18Z-00Z. WITH BETTER

INITIALIZATION/HANDLING OF JET/SHORTWAVE ENERGY OVER THE CENTRAL                
ROCKIES...LEANED TOWARD GFS SOLUTION THIS CYCLE. HOWEVER...FAVORING             
NAM OR GFS OVER THE OTHER LOOKS TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE                    
SENSIBLE WEATHER THRU FRI NIGHT. SHORT TERM FORECAST CONFIDENCE

IN THE SHORT TERM...ONE BETTER CHANCE /LIKELY-HOOD/ OF SHRA/TSRA

DAKOTAS LOW AND INTO THE AREA TONIGHT WITH WEAK/MODERATE THETA-E                
CONVERGENCE AND SOME SFC-700MB FN CONVERGENCE. 925-850MB MOISTURE               
TRANSPORT INTO THE AREA INCREASES AHEAD OF THE TROUGH/FRONT AS WELL.            
WITH DEEP MOISTURE AND PW/S IN THE 1.5 INCH RANGE...EVEN THE                    
WEAK/MDT FORCING SHOULD GENERATE NUMEROUS SHRA/TSRA AS THE                      
TROUGH/FRONT MOVE THRU THE AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE STEEP SFC-            
850MB LAPSE RATES AND MDT MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WITH MINIMAL CIN                
AGAIN TODAY...THUS DIURNAL WARMING SHOULD AGAIN HELP INITIATE SOME              
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. LOWERED POPS A BIT THIS MORNING...THEN               
RAISED THEM TOWARD CATEGORICAL MOST AREAS TONIGHT INTO THU MORNING.             
DRIER AIR/SUBSIDENCE...AT LEAST IN THE MID LEVELS...SPREAD ACROSS

THU NIGHT. THIS BLENDS WELL WITH NEIGHBORING GRIDS FOR NOW...BUT IF             
TIMING AND STRENGTH OF DRYING/SUBSIDENCE CONTINUE TO HOLD LATER                 
SHIFTS MAY BE ABLE TO CARRY A DRY FORECAST THU NIGHT. WITH LIGHT

TIMING/CONSENSUS CONTINUES FRI NIGHT POPS WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE

WATER VAPOR AND PROFILER DATA SHOW RATHER SHARP MID LEVEL TROUGH                
MOVING ACROSS EASTERN KS THIS AFTERNOON.  CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED              
JUST AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH...ALONG/JUST BEHIND SURFACE WIND SHIFT                
LINE.  REAL SURFACE FRONT TRAILS THIS AND CAN BE SEEN APPROACHING               
MHK WITH GUSTIER NWLY WINDS BEHIND IT.  ANOTHER VORT MAX CAN BE SEEN            
IN RUC ANALYSIS OVER SW KS AT MID AFTERNOON AND WILL TRANSLATE EWD              
THIS EVENING.  WOULD APPEAR THAT WITH SUBSIDENCE IN WAKE OF INITIAL             
UPPER TROUGH...AND DEEPER MOISTURE ALONG/AHEAD OF INITIAL SURFACE               
WIND SHIFT...SIGNIFICANT PRECIP CHANCES THIS EVENING WILL BE                    
CONFINED TO FAR EASTERN KS...AND HAVE LOWERED POPS CONSIDERABLY                 
FARTHER WEST.  AS PRECIP CLEARS OUT OF EASTERN KS THIS EVENING...A              
WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN WITH LIGHT WINDS AFTER                    
MIDNIGHT.  THAT COMBINED WITH AT LEAST PARTIAL CLEARING OF THE SKIES            
AND RESIDUAL LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE SUGGESTS FOG WILL BE A POSSIBILITY              
LATE TONIGHT.                                                                   
RIDGE MOVES EWD ON THURSDAY AND RETURN FLOW AND WARM AIR ADVECTION              
BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON INDICATES AT LEAST SMALL CHANCE OF PRECIP                 
DURING THAT TIME.  BOTH NAM AND NGM RATHER AGGRESSIVE IN BRINGING               
PRECIP INTO CENTRAL/EASTERN KS DURING THE AFTERNOON...WHILE GFS MUCH            
SLOWER.  THIS IS REFLECTED IN POP CHANCES FROM GFS AND NAM MOS                  
GUIDANCE WITH 40 TO 50% DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO.  HAVE TENDED TO            
GO TOWARD LOWER POPS FROM GFS AS MAIN LIFT WOULD AT MOST AFFECT NC              
KS DURING THE AFTERNOON.                                                        
GUIDANCE TEMPS FROM VARIOUS MODELS FOR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY ARE                 
SIMILAR...AND CONSISTENT WITH GOING FORECAST...SO LITTLE CHANGE                 
THERE.                                                                          
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THE CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL                 
SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST. A            
SECONDARY 5H TROUGH WILL PIVOT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND                 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...AROUND THE BASE              
OF THE CLOSED UPPER LOW. DEEP GULF MOISTURE OVER OK AND NORTH TX                
WILL SURGE NORTH ACROSS KS THURSDAY NIGHT. LIFT AHEAD OF THE                    
APPROACHING 5H TROUGH AND A SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL CAUSE A LINE OR             
COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS WESTERN KS THURSDAY                  
NIGHT. THIS LINE OR COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS              
THE CWA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THE GFS MODEL SHOWS THE                 
FRONT STALLING OUT ACROSS THE CWA FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO EARLY                   
SATURDAY...WHILE THE NAM IS A BIT FASTER MOVING THE FRONT EAST OF               
THE CWA BY FRIDAY EVENING. ATTM I LEANED A BIT MORE TOWARDS THE GFS             
AND KEPT CHANCE POPS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE ON             
SATURDAY ACROSS THE EASTERN COUNTIES OF THE CWA. ANY HEAVY RAINFALL             
THREAT ACROSS THE CWA WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE INTENSITY AND TRACK              
OF THE MCS OR COMPLEX THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP THURSDAY NIGHT AND             
THE EXACT TRACK OF ANY DEVELOPING MCS. HIGHS ON FRIDAY WILL BE                  
DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL. ATTM I WENT MID TO UPPER                 
70S...THOUGH IF WE SEE MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER DURING THE                
AFTERNOON HOURS HIGH TEMPS COULD BE UP NEAR 80 DEGREES.                         
SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...THE 5H LOW WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST               
ACROSS THE MIDWEST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. A 5H RIDGE WILL                
AMPLIFY ACROSS THE WESTERN CONUS. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE EAST KS WITH              
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. EXPECT MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS WITH HIGH                    
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S. THOUGH ANY MINOR DISTURBANCE EMENDED             
IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT COULD PROVIDE AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR                 
THUNDERSTORM THREAT.                                                            
WEDNESDAY...THE 5H RIDGE ACROSS THE WESTERN CONUS WILL MOVE EAST                
INTO THE HIGH PLAINS AS WINDS ALOFT BEGIN TO BACK FROM THE NORTHWEST            
TO THE WEST. HIGH TEMPERATURES MAY BE A BIT WARMER THAN THE                     
FORECASTED MID 80S...POSSIBLY UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90. THOUGH IF WE                
BEGIN TO GET DEEPER MOISTURE RETURN ACROSS EASTERN KS MIXING DEPTHS             
COULD BE LOWER AND HIGHS WILL BE IN THE MID 80S.                                
&&

WHILE SHOWERS/TSTORMS STILL POSSIBLE THIS EVENING ACROSS FAR EASTERN            
KS...HAVE OPTED NOT TO GO MORE THAN VCTS IN TAF FOR FOE AND TOP FOR             
LATE THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY THIS EVENING.  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED                   
FACTORS FAVORABLE FOR FOG HAVE LEAD ME TO A TEMPO 1 TO 2 SM VSBY                
FROM ABOUT 8 TO 12Z.  WHILE CONSIDERABLE DRYING ALOFT IS FORECAST               
FROM GFS AND NAM TONIGHT...LOWEST LEVEL MIXING RATIOS INCREASE OFF              
THE SURFACE OR STAY STEADY OVER THE LOWEST 25 MB OR SO...SO DENSE               
FOG NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  PRECIP CHANCES MENTIONED FOR THURSDAY             
AFTERNOON BEYOND 18Z TAF ISSUANCE PERIOD BUT BEST CHANCE WOULD BE NC            
KS ANYWAY.

17Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED COLD FRONT WAS WELL TO THE EST OF THE CWA            
WITH HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE BUILDING IN ACROSS EASTERN COLORADO. 17Z               
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY/RUC ANALYSIS INDICATES CUT OFF LOW TO THE NORTH             
OF THE CWA OVER NORTHERN NEBRASKA.                                              
NAM HAD A FEW INITIALIZATION PROBLEMS...AS IT WAS TO WEAK WITH JET              
STREAK AT KGJT AND WAS ALSO SEVERAL DEGREES TO WARM WITH H85 COLD               
AIR MASS AT KGGW. THE GFS ERRORS WERE OVERALL SMALLER. MODEL                    
DIFFERENCES SMALL EARLY...BUT NAM AND GFS DIVERGE WITH HANDLING OF              
H5 LOW...WITH SREF SUPPORTING THE GFS AND INITIALIZATION PROBLEMS               
WILL LEAN IN THIS DIRECTION.                                                    
TONIGHT...PRIMARY CONCERN WILL BE ANY PRECIP CHANCES AS AFTERNOON               
HEATING WILL RESULT IN A WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH LITTLE                    
INHIBITION. WILL KEEP GOING LOW POP FORECAST GOING THROUGH THE                  
EVENING. ALTHOUGH PRECIPITATION WILL BE STRONGLY DIURNALLY                      
DRIVEN...SOME INDICATION OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY OVERNIGHT IN                   
PRESENCE OF WEAK H7 WAA. AM GOING TO KEEP SOME LOW POPS IN THE                  
NORTH OVERNIGHT...IN CASE EARLY EVENING CONVECTION SATURATES THE MID            
LEVELS ENOUGH TO REALIZE ELEVATED INSTABILITY LATER.                            
THURSDAY-THURSDAY NIGHT...CWA WILL REMAIN ON THE PERIPHERY OF H5                
LOW THROUGH THE DAY. SFC TROUGH WILL DEVELOP OVER THE                           
AREA...PROVIDING A WEAK AREA OF CONVERGENCE AND POTENTIAL                       
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE MOISTURE RETURN AFTER            
TODAYS FROPA...BUT WITH TD`S STILL IN THE 50S...AND RELATIVELY COLD             
AIR ALOFT DO THINK THAT MOISTURE RETURN WILL NOT BE THAT BIG OF AN              
ISSUE. H5 WINDS INCREASE TO NEAR 60KTS DURING THE AFTERNOON...AND               
GFS BUFR SOUNDINGS SHOWING VERY LONG...FAIRLY STRAIGHT HODOGRAPHS.              
NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO SLIDE ACROSS THE CWA AFTER 00Z              
AS LOW LVL JET BEGINS TO INTENSIFY. GFS HAS STRONGEST FORCING ON NOSE           
OF LLJ ACROSS NORTHERN CWA...WITH FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE (11-13 G/KG)                
MIXING RATIOS FEEDING INTO THIS AREA. SREF NOT QUITE AS AGGRESSIVE AS           
OPER GFS...BUT STILL SHOWS H85 FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS NORTHERN CWA             
AS LATE AS 06Z. INITIAL THOUGHTS WERE TSRA WOULD FORM ALONG THE                 
TROUGH AND RAPIDLY MOVE EAST...BUT NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH...AND                  
POTENTIAL NOSE OF LLJ BEING ACROSS THE NORTHERN CWA THINK THAT                  
PRECIP POTENTIAL MAY LAST THROUGH THE NIGHT AND UPPED POPS TO HIGH              
CHANCE CATEGORY. IF LLJ/FRONT INTERACTION DOES BEGIN ACROSS THE                 
NORTH...MAY HAVE HYDRO ISSUES ONCE AGAIN. HOWEVER...WITH STRONG MID             
LEVEL FLOW STORMS WILL LIKELY BE MOVING FASTER THAN THE LAST FEW                
DAYS...THIS COMBINED WITH OVERALL UNCERTAINTY WILL KEEP ME FROM                 
ISSUING ANY FLOOD WATCHES...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.             
FRIDAY-FRIDAY NIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY  OUT OF THE AREA       
BY FRIDAY MORNING...PUSHING MOST OF THE INSTABILITY TO THE SOUTH                
ALONG WITH IT. H5 TROUGH WILL STILL BE LIFTING ACROSS THE AREA IN               
THE MORNING...SO PRECIP MAY LINGER IN THE MORNING PERIODS BUT SHOULD            
QUICKLY COME TO AN END AFTER FROPA.                                             
EXTENDED...GFS/ECMWF IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH H5 FIELDS THROUGH             
MUCH OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH MODELS DO BEGIN TO DIVERGE LATE. GFS              
ENSEMBLE MEANS TEND TO SUPPORT ECMWF IN THE LATER PERIODS AND WILL              
LEAN IN THIS DIRECTION.  MAIN CONCERN FOR PERIOD WILL BE                        
TEMPERATURES WITH A FEW SMALL PRECIP CHANCES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.             
THINK WARM UP MAY BE A BIT SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT AS MODEL              
CONSENSUS SUPPORTS IDEA OF  MORE AMPLIFIED FLOW SETTING UP IN THE               
AREA DURING THE PERIOD...RESULTING IN A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION             
OF H5 RIDGE AND RESULTING WARMING TEMPS. WHILE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES             
SUPPORT THE FLATTENING RIDGE BY TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY WHILE THE LATEST              
GFS KEEPS FLOW VERY MUCH AMPLIFIED. AM NOT GOING TO FOLLOW LATEST               
GFS SOLUTION...BUT WILL WARM UP TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES FOR TUE-WED.              
.AVIATION...STRATOCUMULUS AT KGLD/KMCK BASED AROUND 3500 FEET WILL              
DISSPIATE AFTER SUNSET. CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN NORTHEAST                   
COLORADO. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT TSRA COULD CONTINUE PAST SUNSET                
THERE...BUT WILL NOT INDICATE ANY IN THE TERMINAL FORECASTS.                    
OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON

A -18 TO -20C 5H COLD POOL WHICH WILL BE CROSSING THE CWA EARLY

BASED ON SAT AND RADAR TRENDS APPEARS THE THE BETTER                            
DEVELOPMENT OF CU IS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE NAM/RUC 5H VORT LOBE                
WHICH WAS MOVING EAST ACROSS THE CWA AT THIS TIME. WILL CONTINUE                
TO MONITOR THIS BUT AT THIS TIME PLAN IS TO INSERT ONLY SMALL                   
10-15 POPS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS VORT LOBE AS IT CROSSES THE                  
CWA. AFTER THIS ALL MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OUR UPPER              
LOW OVER THE NRN PLAINS MOVING VERY LITTLE THROUGH THE END OF THE               
WORK WEEK. SEVERAL IMPULSES AND JET STREAKS PROGGED TO MOVE AROUND              
THIS SYSTEM WITH ONE OF WHICH PLACES SOUTHWEST KANSAS IN THE RIGHT              
ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET BY THURSDAY NIGHT. ALSO SEEING                 
NICE 85-7H WA AND MOISTURE ADV ACROSS SW LATE IN THE DAY WITH PROB              
OF CAPES GREATER THAN 1000J/KG PROGGED BY SREF IS GREATER THAN 70               
PERCENT BY 00Z FRIDAY. AS A RESULT LOOKS LIKE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST             
IS STILL LOOKING REASONABLE WITH PCP SPREADING INTO THE AREA LATE               
THURSDAY WITH THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF TSRA THURSDAY NIGHT.                    
ON FRIDAY WILL STILL HAVE A FRONT IN OR NEAR OUR CWA AS YET ANOTHER             
S/W TROF MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN HIGH PLAINS TOWARDS                 
WESTERN KANSAS. LOCATION OF THE SFC FRONT REMAINS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN            
WITH MODELS DISAGREEING ON TIMING AND LOCATION AT 00Z SAT. AS A                 
RESULT WILL FOLLOW GENERAL CONSENSUS AT SMALL POPS ACROSS THE                   
ENTIRE AREA EARL FRIDAY WITH HIGH CHC POPS BY FRIDAY NIGHT.                     
DAYS 3-7...                                                                     
GLOBAL MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF                 
QUASI-STATIONARY UPPER LOW CURRENTLY SITUATED OVER THE NORTHERN                 
GREAT PLAINS.  AS LONG AS THIS UPPER FEATURE REMAINS OVER THE                   
MIDWEST STATES...THEN THIS WILL KEEP WESTERN KANSAS IN A NORTHWEST              
FLOW PATTERN WITH EFFECTIVE SURFACE BOUNDARY JUST SOUTH OF SOUTHWEST            
KANSAS THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY AND PROBABLY INTO MONDAY AS WELL.                
THE MAIN CHALLENGE GOING INTO EARLY NEXT WILL BE THE TRANSITION FROM            
NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN FROM THE WEAKENING/DEPARTING MIDWEST                     
LOW/TROUGH...TO A MORE WESTERLY FLOW AS VERY STRONG PACIFIC JET                 
BEGINS TO APPROACH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION.                                
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS PATTERN NEXT WEEK WILL              
EVOLVE.  THE ECMWF AND GFS SHOW AN INCREASINGLY BLOCKY LOOKING                  
PATTERN NOW EARLY NEXT WEEK...AN OMEGA BLOCK TYPE PATTERN IN                    
FACT...WITH RIDGING CENTERED OVER THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE ROCKIES              
WELL INTO CANADA.  THE DAY 6-7 ECMWF MODEL FROM THE 30/00Z RUN                  
SUGGESTS THAT THIS BLOCKING WILL NOT BE THAT STRONG AND SUFFICIENT              
FLOW WILL LIKELY CUT THROUGH THE OMEGA BLOCK SUPPORTING FAVORABLE               
LOWER TROPOSPHERIC SETTING FOR ORGANIZED SEVERE THUNDERSTORM

NO MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR AVIATION CONCERNS THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS                  
VFR CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL. EXPECT WINDS TO CONTINUE TO SLOWLY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT/THU)...                                                    
MAIN FCST ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE SHRA/TSRA POTENTIAL.                            
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A BROAD MIDLEVEL LOW OVER             
THE WRN DAKOTAS/ERN MT. A NUMBER OF SHORTWAVES ARE ROTATING AROUND              
THE LOW THRU THE CNTRL ROCKIES/WRN PLAINS. TO THE E...THE WRN GREAT             
LAKES REGION IS WITHIN DEEP LAYERED SW FLOW BTWN THE MIDLEVEL LOW               
AND THE DOWNSTREAM RIDGE COVERING THE SE STATES TO THE GREAT LAKES.             
WITHIN THE FLOW...THERE ARE NO DISCERNIBLE SHORTWAVES UPSTREAM THAT             
WILL AFFECT UPPER MI THRU AT LEAST THIS EVENING. SHRA/TSRA HAVE ONCE            
AGAIN DEVELOPED DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY OVER THE W THIRD OF THE              
FCST AREA...SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY. RECENT ANALYSIS                 
SHOWS MLCAPE NEAR 1000J/KG IN THAT AREA.                                        
SINCE THERE ARE NO APPARENT SHORTWAVES MOVING TOWARD THE AREA THIS              
EVENING...EXPECT ONGOING SCT SHRA/TSRA TO DISSIPATE GRADUALLY WITH              
LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING/DIMINISHING INSTABILITY. SO...WILL AGAIN                
TRANSITION TO A DRY FCST FOR THE OVERNIGHT HRS...SIMILAR TO LAST                
NIGHT. ONLY EXCEPTION IS OVER THE FAR W. STRONGER SHORTWAVE ROTATING            
THRU NEBRASKA WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH LATE TONIGHT TO WARRANT CHC POPS             
AGAIN OVER THE FAR W LATE IN THE NIGHT. CONSIDERED ADDING A MENTION             
OF FOG...BUT WITH 15-20KT WINDS JUST ABOVE THE SFC...SEEMS UNLIKELY             
FOG WILL BECOME DENSE ENOUGH TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VSBY. SHOULD BE            
MORE OF AN AVIATION ISSUE WITH 3-5SM TYPE VSBY. ONLY EXCEPTION IS ON            
THE KEWEENAW WHERE SFC WIND FIELD MAY HAVE A LIGHT UPSLOPE ESE                  
COMPONENT AND NEAR LAKE MICHIGAN WHERE LIGHT ONSHORE WIND WILL ALSO             
BE OCCURRING. WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THOSE AREAS. SHOULD BE                 
ANOTHER MILD NIGHT WITH MINS IN MOST LOCATIONS NOT LWR THAN THE LWR             
60S.                                                                            
STRONGER SHORTWAVE WILL PINWHEEL TOWARD UPPER MI THU EVEN THOUGH                
MIDLEVEL LOW WILL REMAIN OVER THE CNTRL/WRN DAKOTAS. ALONG WITH THE             
SHORTWAVE...AN ASSOCIATED SFC TROF WILL ALSO PUSH W INTO UPPER MI.              
SHORTWAVE/SFC TROF SHOULD PROVIDE A NICE FOCUSING FOR GREATER                   
COVERAGE OF SHRA/TSRA. GFS/NAM TIMING IS SIMILAR...SUGGESTING PCPN              
THREAT WILL REACH THE W IN THE MORNING AND THE CNTRL BY AFTN. ONCE              
AGAIN...STABILIZATION OFF LAKE MICHIGAN IN SRLY FLOW MAY LIMIT SHRA             
POTENTIAL E OF MARQUETTE/ESCANABA LINE. ALSO...SINCE SHORTWAVE WILL             
BE LIFTING MORE N THAN E...FORCING FARTHER E WILL BE WEAKER. INITIAL            
THOUGHT WAS TO LEAVE THE ERN FCST AREA DRY THRU THU AFTN...BUT WILL             
JUST KEEP LWR CHC POPS THERE FOR NOW. MODIFIED GFS FCST SOUNDING FOR            
A SFC T/TD OF 77/60F YIELDS SBCAPE AROUND 700J/KG. HOWEVER...IT IS A            
BIT UNCERTAIN HOW WARM IT WILL GET BEFORE SHRA/TSRA ARRIVE SINCE                
THERE SHOULD BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER AHEAD OF PCPN. BEST                
DEEP LAYER SHEAR UPWARDS OF 40KT (SUFFICIENT FOR ORGANIZED SVR                  
CONVECTION) LAGS JUST BEHIND SFC TROF AND EXPECTED AREA OF                      
SHRA/TSRA. NONETHELESS...IT IS CLOSE AND SUGGESTS A POTENTIAL THAT A            
FEW STORMS MAY APPROACH SVR CRITERIA IF ENOUGH INSTABILITY DEVELOPS.            
LATER FCSTS WILL NEED TO REEXAMINE POTENTIAL OF SVR STORMS.                     
.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...

PENINSULA THURSDAY EVENING...MAKING IT INTO THE EASTERN ZONES                   
SHORTLY AFTER 06Z.  WITH A MORE PROLONGED PERIOD OF FEW                         
CLOUDS...HAVE KEPT THE LOWER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF            
THE AREA.                                                                       
OUR MEANDERING SURFACE LOW TO THE WEST WILL CONTINUE ON THE SAME                
COURSE UNTIL SATURDAY.  AS A RESULT...WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE MAINLY            
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  SOME                    
DISCREPANCIES SHOW UP IN THE PRECIPITATION FIELDS COME SATURDAY                 
MORNING AND AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARING THE GFS AND NAM.              
THE NAM HAS CONTINUED TO BE QUICKER THAN A MAJORITY OF THE OTHER                
MODELS AND AS A RESULT...HAVE THROWN IT OUT AFTER 00Z SATURDAY.                 
HOWEVER...PRIOR TO 00Z SATURDAY THERE ARE FEW LARGE SCALE

.UPDATE (ISSUED AT 1100 AM EDT)...                                              
MAIN FCST ISSUE THIS AFTN IS SHRA/TSRA POTENTIAL.                               
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A MIDLEVEL LOW CLOSING OFF            
OVER THE WRN DAKOTAS/ERN MT. THE WRN GREAT LAKES REGION IS WITHIN               
DEEP LAYERED SW FLOW BTWN THE MIDLEVEL LOW AND THE DOWNSTREAM RIDGE             
COVERING THE SE STATES TO THE GREAT LAKES. THERE ARE NO DISCERNIBLE             
SHORTWAVES UPSTREAM THAT WILL AFFECT UPPER MI THIS AFTN. IT HAS BEEN            
A DRY MORNING ACROSS THE FCST AREA...AND THERE ARE ONLY SOME                    
MID/HIGH CLOUDS PASSING ACROSS UPPER MI.                                        
SINCE THERE ARE NO APPARENT SHORTWAVES MOVING TOWARD THE AREA THIS              
AFTN...WILL NEED TO RELY ON AFTN INSTABILITY FOR SHRA/TSRA                      
DEVELOPMENT. MODIFIED 12Z KGRB SOUNDING FOR AN EXPECTED SFC T/TD OF

CLOUDS THINNED OUT ACROSS THE AREA. SATELLITE SHOWS A DRY SLOT                  
PIVOTING THROUGH THE REGION. THE LARGE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX WAS                   
STEADILY MOVING SOUTH AND EAST...WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY FOR                   
IMPACTS TO THE CWA. THE LINE OF STORMS WERE MOVING QUICKLY. BREAKS IN           
THE CLOUDS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB IN A FEW SPOTS...SO RAISED             
TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO...IN AREAS ORIENTED ALONG THE NATCHEZ TRACE.              
THE SYSTEM TO THE SOUTH HAD NOT PROGRESSED NORTH MUCH...SO BEST RAIN            
WAS STILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CWA. ACTIVITY TO THE NORTH CONTINUES TO              
DISSIPATE AS IT MOVES OUT OF THE AREA...SO ONLY A SMALL AREA OF LIGHT           
RAIN LINGERING OVER THE SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA AT THIS POINT.            
RUC SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY OVER THE SOUTHEAST...BUT OF               
COURSE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING IS STILL WEST. COULD NOT JUSTIFY ANY              
CHANGES TO THE POPS...ALTHOUGH THE VALUES WERE HIGH. SHOWERS CONTINUE           
TO POP UP AROUND THE CWA...SO WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VALUES FOR              
NOW. ADJUSTED WORDING FOR COVERAGE. MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS AROUND               
1.5IN PW...BUT A DECENT DRY LAYER IN THE LOWER LEVELS. HOWEVER                  
SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND 30-40KTS IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS WILL HELP               
BRING MORE OF THE GULF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION. MAY ADD A FEW LINES            
TO THE HWO ABOUT STRONG STORMS...COULD SEE SOME GOOD WINDS IF THE               
SQUALL LINE SWINGS THROUGH THE AREA. LAPSE RATES WERE NOT TOO

ITS INTENSITY IF IT REACHES THE AREA...WILL MAINTAIN SHRA AND VCTS              
FOR GLH/GWO/JAN AT THIS POINT. WILL KEEP SIMILAR TIMING AROUND 21Z.             
STORMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTH LOUISIANA...SO WILL MAINTAIN              
VCTS FOR HBG ALSO. RAIN ACTIVITY WILL BE MOSTLY SCATTERED IN NATURE             
FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON...SO WILL KEEP SHRA IN AT ALL SITES THROUGH           
THE EVENING. SHOULD SEE THE ACTIVITY TAPER OFF OVERNIGHT...BUT                  
ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE. WILL LIKELY CONTINUE FOG                 
TONIGHT ALSO. WINDS PICKED UP IN A FEW SPOTS...NOT EXPECTING                    
CONDITIONS TO REACH ADVISORY CONDITIONS...BUT WINDS 10-15KTS WITH               
OCCASIONAL GUSTS AROUND 20 CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGH THE

EARLY AGAIN ON THURSDAY AND CONTINUE OFF AND ON THROUGH THE                     
PERIOD...SO WILL BRING SHRA BACK INTO ALL SITES AROUND 13Z.                     
OCCASIONAL THUNDERSTORMS MAY BRING SOME HIGHER GUSTS...HEAVY RAIN MAY           
ALSO REDUCE VISIBILITIES BRIEFLY...BUT OVERALL VFR/MVFR CONDITIONS              
ARE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE PERIOD. CEILINGS REMAIN ABOVE

.SHORT TERM...THROUGH 12Z FRIDAY. MAIN FOCUS IS ON THUNDERSTORM                 
CHANCES THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT AND ATTENDANT SEVERE POTENTIAL.             
AFTERNOON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE LARGE CUTOFF UPPER LOW                  
CONTINUING TO SPIN OVER THE NORTHERN ROCKIES AND PLAINS WITH SEVERAL            
VORT MAXES ROTATING AROUND THE PARENT CIRCULATION. THE SURFACE COLD             
FRONT HAS SHIFTED WELL EAST OF THE AREA...NOW RUNNING ROUGHLY                   
NORTH/SOUTH FROM EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA INTO EASTERN OKLAHOMA. LOW                
CLOUDS AND SHOWERS HAVE MAINLY PUSHED EAST OF THE CWA AS A VORT LOBE            
CONTINUES TO PUSH NORTHEAST ACROSS CENTRAL NEBRASKA. SUBSIDENCE                 
BEHIND THE WAVE HAS RESULTED IN PERIODS OF BRIEF CLEARING OVER THE              
CWA...WITH STRATOCU FILLING IN QUICKLY BEHIND.                                  
THE CUTOFF UPPER LOW MOVES LITTLE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE                          
DAYS...CONTINUING TO SPIN OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE MAIN                    
QUESTION FOR TONIGHT IS WHETHER ANY SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS CURRENTLY             
DEVELOPING OVER THE HIGH PLAINS WILL MAKE IT EAST INTO THE CWA. THE             
NAM/GFS/RUC ALL INDICATE THAT SOME WEAK SHOWERS MAY MAKE IT INTO THE            
NORTHWEST THIS EVENING BEFORE DISSIPATING BEFORE MIDNIGHT...AND WITH            
SUPPORT FROM CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND SOUTHEAST                           
MOVEMENT...HAVE INSERTED SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING                
HOURS. WITH FAIRLY STABLE CONDITIONS IN PLACE AND SHOWERS/STORMS                
EXPECTED TO BE ON THE DECLINE BEFORE MAKING IT THIS FAR                         
EAST...DECIDED TO JUST GO WITH SHOWERS VERSUS THUNDERSTORMS.                    
BETTER PRECIPITATION CHANCES RETURN THURSDAY AS ANOTHER MID-LEVEL               
SHORTWAVE ROUNDS THE UPPER LOW AND SLIDES ACROSS THE AREA. THIS                 
SHOULD PROVIDE AMPLE FORCING TO TRIGGER CONVECTION...SOME OF WHICH              
MAY REACH STRONG TO SEVERE LIMITS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY                
EVENING. MOISTURE RETURN WILL BE LIMITED WITH SFC DEWPOINTS ONLY                
EXPECTED TO REACH THE LOWER 50S...BUT COLD MID-LEVEL TEMPS                      
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW AND RESULTANT STEEP LAPSE RATES WILL              
COMPENSATE FOR THIS TO PRODUCE CAPES AROUND 1000 J/KG. DEEP-LAYER               
SHEAR OF 40-50 KTS WILL BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT SEVERE                 
CONVECTION. MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE LARGE HAIL GIVEN COLD TEMPS                 
ALOFT ALTHOUGH STRONG WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE AS WELL. A SURFACE                 
BOUNDARY GETS SHOVED SOUTH THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH               
BETTER PRECIP CHANCES SHIFTING SOUTH THROUGH THE NIGHT IN RESPONSE.             
TEMPERATURES REBOUND SOMEWHAT TOMORROW AS H85 TEMPS CLIMB INTO THE              
LOWER TO MID TEENS BUT CLOUD COVER WILL TEMPER HEATING SOMEWHAT.                
.LONG TERM...FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH NEXT WEDNESDAY THE MODELS                   
CONTINUE TO SHOW THE LARGE CUT OFF UPPER CYCLONE OVER THE NORTHERN              
PLAINS...SLOWLY SHIFTING EAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY MONDAY.                   
INITIALLY THIS WAVE WILL BRING AN ADDITIONAL CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND              
THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT IS SHOWN TO PUSH THROUGH THE            
REGION.  SOME POSSIBILITY WITH THIS FRONT FOR SEVERE                            
CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH MOST OF THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO EARLY ON                
FRIDAY.  MAIN QUESTION FOR THIS PERIOD INVOLVES NEXT TUESDAY AND                
WEDNESDAY AS THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE VARYING THE PATTERN OVER               
THE CENTRAL CONUS FROM A FAIRLY ZONAL REGIME PER 12Z GFS...TO A                 
LARGE NORTHERN STREAM WAVE RIDING ACROSS THE PLAINS.  THE DIFFERENCE            
IN THE UPPER PATTERN IS HUGE FOR THE PLAINS AS THE FIRST SOLUTION               
WOULD BE LITTLE CHANCE OF PRECIP AND HOT...WHILE THE SECOND SOLUTION            
WOULD BE WET AND COOLER.  AT THIS POINT...CONFIDENCE IN EITHER                  
SOLUTION IS LOW AND WILL INSERT A LOW CHANCE OF PRECIP BUT KEEP                 
TEMPERATURES NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL.                                              
&&                                                                              
.AVIATION...SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND MEAN UPPER LOW OVER THE                   
NORTHERN ROCKIES/PLAINS CONTINUES TO PUSH NORTHEAST ACROSS CENTRAL              
NEBRASKA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL PUSH THE SHOWER ACTIVITY TO THE              
NORTHEAST AS WELL...AND BELIEVE SHOWERS WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE                
KGRI TERMINAL AS A RESULT...ALTHOUGH SOME WILL BE IN THE VICINITY               
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. LOWER CEILINGS WILL CONTINUE TO CLEAR FROM                
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AS INDICATED BY LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH          
SCATTERED VFR CLOUDS FILLING IN BEHIND. MAY SEE PERIODS OF BROKEN               
CEILINGS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS STRATOCU FILLS IN...BUT THEY                  
LOOK TO REMAIN VFR. BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN                
THIS AFTERNOON AS THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WEAKENS. NEXT                   
IMPACT WILL BE SOME POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS LATE IN THE TAF PERIOD               
THURSDAY MORNING...AND HAVE COVERED WITH A PROB GROUP FOR NOW AS

AN ALL OR NOTHING TYPE OF EVENT FOR WEST CENTRAL TEXAS UPCOMING...              
AND PLAYING THE WAITING GAME RIGHT NOW.                                         
SURFACE BASED CAPES HAVE CLIMBED ABOVE 3500 ALREADY...WITH THE 18Z              
RUC SHOWING EVEN BETTER INSTABILITY LATER THIS AFTERNOON. CAP HAS               
HELD SO FAR...BUT CU HAS STARTED TO DEVELOP. MAY BE A FEW MORE                  
HOURS...BUT THINK AT LEAST SCATTERED STORMS WILL DEVELOP THIS                   
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AND GIVEN THE INSTABILITY...MAY QUICKLY                 
REACH SEVERE LEVELS. NEXT QUESTION IS WHERE? FRONTAL BOUNDARY                   
DRAPED BETWEEN SWEETWATER AND ABILENE...WITH SOMEWHAT ILL DEFINED               
DRYLINE EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE CONCHO VALLEY AND NORTHERN                   
EDWARDS PLATEAU. ALSO WATCHED THE VERY BACK EDGE OF AN OUTFLOW                  
BOUNDARY CREEP INTO THE EASTERN COUNTIES EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.                
COULD SEE THE STORMS DEVELOP ANYWHERE ALONG ANY OF THESE                        
BOUNDARIES...BUT AREAS ACROSS THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE BIG                     
COUNTRY PROBABLY THE MOST LIKELY. THEN WE WILL SEE IF A MORE                    
WIDESPREAD COMPLEX CAN END UP FORMING.                                          
WILL CONTINUE THE SMALL POPS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...AS               
FRONTAL BOUNDARY BEGINS TO WASH OUT. CAP SHOULD BE A LITTLE WEAKER              
AND SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF INSTABILITY...BUT GETTING SOME SORT OF                
SURFACE CONVERGENCE TO BREAK THROUGH THE REMAINING CAP MAY STILL                
BE TOUGH. WILL NEED TO SEE WHATS LEFT OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND               
WHERE ANY OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL END UP.

NORTHWEST FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN                          
PLAINS...WITH A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES DROPPING THROUGH. HARD TO                  
RULE OUT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHWEST FLOW...WITH EITHER                 
STUFF DEVELOPING WELL TO THE NORTHWEST ROLLING IN                               
SATURDAY... SUNDAY...OR EVEN MONDAY NIGHT...OR AT LEAST SHOVING                 
BOUNDARIES DOWN OUR DIRECTION. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SLIGHT

.AVIATION...OVERALL REDUCED POSSIBILITIES IN THE TAFS OF                        
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. STILL CAN NOT RULE OUT THUNDERSTORM                   
DEVELOPMENT NORTHEAST OF A LINE FROM KSJT TO KJCT. WILL CONTINUE                
TO MENTION ONLY A PROB30 AFTER 03Z FOR KABI AND KBBD AS THESE                   
LOCATIONS IN THE BEST LOCATION FOR TSRA DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE                  
WILL NOT MENTION IN THE OTHER TAFS AS WE ARE NOT THAT CONFIDENT.                
MAY NEED TO AMEND AS WE SEE HOW THINGS DEVELOP. OTHERWISE...WINDS               
WILL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MOVING THROUGH               
THE AREA. COLD FRONT CURRENTLY BETWEEN KSWW AND KABI WILL BE SLOW               
TO MOVE THROUGH THE DAY UNTIL NEW THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLY DEVELOP                
ALONG IT THIS AFTERNOON. UNTIL FROPA...WINDS WILL BE RATHER

UPDATE...HAVE UPDATED FORECAST TO REMOVE POPS TO THE SOUTHWEST                  
FOR THE DAY AS THIS AREA IS IN THE MUCH STRONGER CAP AND DOUBT                  
ANYTHING WILL DEVELOP SOUTHWEST OF A STERLING CITY TO SAN ANGELO                
TO SAN SABA LINE. ALSO PUSHED BACK TIMING OF THUNDERSTORM                       
DEVELOPMENT TO THE NORTHWEST OF THAT LINE TIL AFTER 21Z AS WE HAVE              
TO WEAKEN THE CAP AND GET THE FRONT A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE SOUTH               
FOR BETTER CONVERGENCE. IF THUNDERSTORMS DO GET GOING THIS                      
AFTERNOON...RUC FORECAST CAPES TO BE 4 TO 6 THOUSAND J/KG AND                   
STORMS WILL LIKELY BE SEVERE. SO WENT AHEAD AND MENTIONED SEVERE                
FOR THIS AFTERNOON WHERE WE THINK STORMS WILL DEVELOP. ALSO                     
COOLED TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE BIG COUNTRY...WHERE CLOUDS AND                   
OUTFLOWS AND SOME FRONTAL EFFECTS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A LITTLE               
COOLER. FURTHER TO THE SOUTH WHERE THE STRONG CAP IS IN PLACE AND               
LESS EFFECTS FROM CLOUDS...OUTFLOWS AND FRONT...HAVE INCREASED

DEVELOP ACROSS BIG COUNTRY NEAR THE BOUNDARY AFTER 30/20Z. ISOLD

COLD FRONT SOUTH OF AMARILLO AT 3 AM LIKELY TO MOVE SOUTH                       
INTO THE BIG COUNTRY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE...WITH A EXTRA              
PUSH FROM OUTFLOW FROM STRONG/SEVERE STORMS MOVING INTO WESTERN                 
OKLAHOMA. WITH WRF SB CAPES OF 4000 J/KG BY MID AFTERNOON IN THE                
BIG COUNTRY...MAY SEE A FEW SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. WILL MENTION                  
SEVERE IN BIG COUNTRY ZONES TONIGHT. WRF MODEL HANGS UP FRONT                   
ALONG I-20 TONIGHT...BEFORE LIFTING NORTH FRIDAY...BUT ACTUAL                   
POSITION DEPENDS ON CONVECTION AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT MAY                  
DRIVE IT SOUTHWARD. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ALSO POSSIBLE ON DRYLINE                
THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING IN CROCKETT COUNTY AND THE WESTERN CONCHO               
VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON...THEN MOVE EAST IN THE EVENING. THIS A                 
LESS LIKELY...BUT STILL POSSIBLE. CAP HAS BEEN HARD TO ERODE THE                
LAST COUPLE DAYS...EVEN THOUGH MODELS INDICATE LITTLE/NO CAP BY                 
AFTERNOON.
