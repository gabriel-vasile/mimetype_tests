QUICK UPDATE THIS EVENING TO FRESHEN ZFP WORDING BY REMOVING EARLY              
EVENING POPS. DECIDED TO LEAVE SOME SPRINKLES IN SOUTHERN COUNTIES              
UNTIL FRONT COMPLETELY CLEARS THAT AREA. STILL SOME CLOUDS SEEN ON              
SATELLITE WITH THIS FRONT AND RUC40 GENERATING SOME DECENT 850MB                
OMEGA BEFORE 06Z. HOWEVER...LOWER LEVELS QUITE DRY AND WITHOUT                  
SIGNIFICANT FORCING JUST DO NOT SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF MEASURABLE               
PCPN OCCURING. DECIDED TO RAISE MAX TEMPS FOR WED BASED ON OBJECTIVE            
GUIDANCE TRENDS LAST SEVERAL RUNS AND UPSTREAM TEMPERATURES BEHIND              
COLD FRONT TODAY. EXPERIMENTAL WAM NUMBERS ALSO SUPPORTING WARMER               
TEMPERATURES. BIGGEST CHANGE WAS TO CONFINE LAKE EFFECTS ON                     
TEMPERATURE CLOSER TO LAKE MICHIGAN. LOW LEVEL WINDS SHOULD BE MORE             
NORTHEAST AND LIGHT BUT STILL EXPECT A LAKE BREEZE TO DEVELOP...JUST            
NOT MOVE INLAND AS MUCH AS PREVIOUS GRIDS INDICATED. THUS SBN

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA LATE THIS                     
AFTERNOON/EVENING. A FEW RAIN SHOWERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT             
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH OUR MICHIGAN                   
COUNTIES. NOT EXPECTING MUCH RAIN FROM THIS FRONT. NOT VERY MANY                
CLOUDS CURRENTLY IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS...MOST OF THE CLOUDS ARE OVER             
LAKE MICHIGAN AND SOUTHERN MICHIGAN. JUST KEPT THE LOW CHANCE POPS              
WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...THE RAIN CHANCES              
WILL END AS DRIER AIR IS BEHIND THE FRONT. ALSO WINDS TONIGHT WILL              
TURN TO THE NORTH AND THEN TO THE NORTHEAST TOMORROW MORNING. 12Z               
TOMORROW MORNING THE MODELS HAVE THE FRONT OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA AND            
THEN DURING THE DAY MOVE IT SOUTH OF THE STATE AS HIGH PRESSURE                 
MOVES IN. TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO AROUND 40 ACROSS OUR CWA AND                
THEN RISE TO AROUND 60 TOMORROW...EXCEPT AREAS NEAR LAKE MICHIGAN               
WILL BE COOLER.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY...OVERALL...EXPECT A COOL AND              
GENERALLY DRY PATTERN TO DOMINATE THE PERIOD. WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR            
SHOWERS IN LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS ANOTHER COOL FRONT              
PASSES...BUT ONCE AGAIN WITH MOISTURE LIMITED AND A WEAK FRONT...DO             
NOT EXPECT MUCH RAIN. AFTER THURSDAY...HAVE KEPT THE FORECAST DRY               
AND COOL WITH TEMPS BELOW NORMAL. GFS OF RECENT HAS HAD POOR RUN TO             
RUN CONSISTENCY WHICH IS APPARENT IN MEX MOS FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH               
TEMPS AND POPS. BUT BASIC UPPER AIR PATTERN OF A DEVELOPING TROF                
OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS BY EARLY NEXT WEEK ALONG WITH A STRONG SFC               
RIDGE OVER CENTRAL CANADA IS PREEMINENT. EARLIER RUNS OF THE GFS WAS            
SUGGESTING A SURFACE WAVE WOULD SPREAD AT LEAST SOME PRECIPITATION              
OVER THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA THIS WEEKEND...BUT GIVEN DOMINANT            
NORTH TO NORTHEAST SFC FLOW AND RUN TO RUN INCONSISTENCIES OF THE               
GFS AND ALSO TREND OF THE GFS TO OVER FORECAST PRECIPITATION IN THE             
NORTHERN PART OF STORM SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF DRY AIR                    
ADVECTING IN THE LOWER LAYERS...HAVE KEEP THE FORECAST DRY. 12Z GFS             
SHOWED VERY COOL TEMPS SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY OF -4C OR COLDER AT             
850 MB. HAVE HIGH BASICALLY 45 TO 50 THROUGH THE PERIOD TO MATCH                
THESE COOL TEMPS. 12Z GFS EXTENDED WAS EVEN SLOWER WITH MAJOR TROF              
EJECTING OUT OF THE PLAINS EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS RUN FROM LAST NIGHT             
WAS BRINGING PRECIPITATION IN MONDAY...BUT NEW 12Z RUN WAS DRY                  
THROUGH TUESDAY. GIVEN TENDENCY FOR GFS TO BE TOO FAST WITH HIGHLY              
AMPLIFIED SYSTEMS HAVE OPTED TO KEEP TUESDAY DRY AS THIS REASONING              
SUGGESTS BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WOULD BE AFTER TUESDAY.

FORECAST ON TARGET TONIGHT. MAIN CONCERN IS THE THREAT OF LOWER                 
CLOUDS. 18Z ETA LIKE THE 12Z RUN WITH PLENTY OF 925 MOISTURE ACROSS             
THE CWA. HOWEVER...CURRENT OBS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS...AND 21Z RUC                
MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH CURRENT SITUATION WITH ONLY APN AND SSM                  
REPORTING THE LOWER CLOUDS. THEREFORE...THE CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH              
THE WEAK SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF SOUTHEAST LOWER             
MICHIGAN BY AROUND 03Z. WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE                
THUMB AS THIS WILL BE THE MOSTLY LIKELY SPOT FOR THE LOWER CLOUDS TO            
RETURN. PLUS WINDS WILL TURN TO THE NORTH NORTHWEST WHICH SHOULD AID            
SC DEVELOPMENT.                                                                 
WINDS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SLOW TO TURN TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST...SO            
WILL HAVE TO TIME THE WINDS IN THE FORECAST A LITTLE SLOWER TOO.                
TEMPS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A BIT WARMER. BUT WITH PARTLY CLOUDY                    
SKIES...WINDS BECOMING LIGHTER AND DEW POINTS GENERALLY IN THE MID              
AND UPPER 30S...EXPECT TEMPS TO REACH FORECAST LOW TEMPS...SO NO                
CHANGES THERE.

A COUPLE OF ISSUES HERE TO RESOLVE...JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM MINOR.              
DESPITE SOME IMPRESSIVE RETURNS ON KGRR RADAR...CEILINGS AT 7K FEET             
TELL THE STORY WITH ONLY SPRINKLES HITTING THE GROUND TO OUR WEST.              
THIS ACTIVITY OCCURRING IN AREA OF ENHANCED THETA-E ADVECTION. BEST             
ADVECTION WILL BE CONFINED TO THE SOUTH HALF OF THE CWA THROUGH                 
ABOUT 00Z THEN SLIDE EAST TAKING PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA. WILL CARRY             
SCT -SHRA THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING...MAINLY SOUTH...OTHERWISE DRY.             
OTHER ISSUE WILL BE WITH CLOUDS. MESOETA IS FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE IN                
BRINGING LOW CLOUDS DOWN ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWA AS LOW PASSES TO OUR            
EAST AND COLD FRONT DROPS IN BEHIND THE LOW. CURRENTLY MESOETA IS               
OVERDONE ON RH FIELD...PARTICULARLY ACROSS NW LOWER MICHIGAN. NGM               
AND RUC SUGGEST BULK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL PASS TO OUR EAST.               
WILL CARRY MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THUMB TONIGHT AND PARTLY CLOUDY                    
ELSEWHERE.                                                                      
EXPECT WHATEVER CLOUDS ARE AROUND WEDNESDAY MORNING TO GIVE WAY TO              
PARTLY/MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR AFTERNOON. MAX TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY.             
TEMPERATURES IN WI WARMING NICELY THIS AFTERNOON WITH READINGS INTO             
THE 60S...AND LIKELY TO HIT 70 BEFORE THE DAY IS DONE. HOWEVER...A              
COUPLE OF FACTORS TO CONSPIRE TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN HERE                           
TOMORROW...850MB TEMPS SOME 3-5C LOWER THAN WI...HIGH OVERHEAD                  
LIKELY TO LIMIT MIXING...AND FINALLY LIGHT 950MB WINDS SHOULD                   
PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF AT LEAST A WEAK LAKE BREEZE.                             
NEXT ISSUE WILL BE PRECIP CHANCES ON THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE SLOWED               
SYSTEM SOME...ENOUGH TO REMOVE LIGHT PRECIP CHANCES FOR NW CWA                  
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ETA LOOKS TO BE THE MORE CONSISTENT OF THE MODELS              
IN TERMS OF STORM TRACK AND LIFT. WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MIND...WILL              
LEAN TOWARD ETA SOLUTION. LIMITING FACTOR AS FAR AS PRECIP IS                   
CONCERNED PER ETA...IS LIMITED MOISTURE WITH LOW PUSHING THROUGH                
CWA. PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS. WILL CARRY CHANCE OF                    
SHRA-BOTH ETA AND GFS THICKNESSES WOULD SUPPORT RAIN. AS LOW PULLS              
OUT...ETA WANTS TO SWING UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF ACROSS THE                          
REGION...WHILE GFS STREAMS A RIBBON OF CHANNELED VORTICITY ACROSS               
CWA. WILL LINGER THURSDAY PRECIP INTO THURSDAY EVENING...THEN HOLD              
DRY.

WILL THERE BE SNOWFLAKES ON YOUR EASTER BONNET. THAT AMONG OTHER                
ITEMS CONFRONTS US HERE. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN EVOLVING LONG              
WAVE TROUGH TO THE WEST OF US DURING THE PERIOD...WITH GFS CUTTING              
OFF SYSTEM INTO UPPER LOW ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST LATE IN THE

DOMINATING FEATURE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WILL BE STRONG ARCTIC HIGH              
PRESSURE THAT WILL CROSS CANADA...PROVIDING CWA WITH DRY NORTHEAST              
FLOW. COLD AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE CWA AS THE HIGH SWINGS THROUGH              
CANADA...WITH 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO -8C SUNDAY /EASTER/ MORNING.              
CLIMO IS AROUND 1C. GFS HAS HAD DIFFICULTY RESOLVING PRECIP CHANCES             
ACROSS CWA...WITH CURRENT GFS/CANADIAN PRECIP ENSEMBLES OFFERING                
LITTLE SUPPORT FOR PRECIP ON SUNDAY. WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY...BUT                 
NOTE...THAT IF GFS WERE TO VERIFY...SOME SNOWFLAKES COULD FLY ON                
EASTER. MOVING INTO MONDAY-TUESDAY PERIOD...STILL DIFFERENCES IN                
MODELS...AND AMONG MODELS. GFS PUSHES POTENT SURFACE LOW RIGHT

A COUPLE OF ISSUES HERE TO RESOLVE...JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM MINOR.              
DESPITE SOME IMPRESSIVE RETURNS ON KGRR RADAR...CEILINGS AT 7K FEET             
TELL THE STORY WITH ONLY SPRINKLES HITTING THE GROUND TO OUR WEST.              
THIS ACTIVITY OCCURRING IN AREA OF ENHANCED THETA-E ADVECTION. BEST             
ADVECTION WILL BE CONFINED TO THE SOUTH HALF OF THE CWA THROUGH                 
ABOUT 00Z THEN SLIDE EAST TAKING PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA. WILL CARRY             
SCT -SHRA THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING...MAINLY SOUTH...OTHERWISE DRY.             
OTHER ISSUE WILL BE WITH CLOUDS. MESOETA IS FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE IN                
BRINGING LOW CLOUDS DOWN ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWA AS LOW PASSES TO OUR            
EAST AND COLD FRONT DROPS IN BEHIND THE LOW. CURRENTLY MESOETA IS               
OVERDONE ON RH FIELD...PARTICULARLY ACROSS NW LOWER MICHIGAN. NGM               
AND RUC SUGGEST BULK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL PASS TO OUR EAST.               
WILL CARRY MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THUMB TONIGHT AND PARTLY CLOUDY                    
ELSEWHERE.                                                                      
EXPECT WHATEVER CLOUDS ARE AROUND WEDNESDAY MORNING TO GIVE WAY TO              
PARTLY/MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR AFTERNOON. MAX TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY.             
TEMPERATURES IN WI WARMING NICELY THIS AFTERNOON WITH READINGS INTO             
THE 60S...AND LIKELY TO HIT 70 BEFORE THE DAY IS DONE. HOWEVER...A              
COUPLE OF FACTORS TO CONSPIRE TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN HERE                           
TOMORROW...850MB TEMPS SOME 3-5C LOWER THAN WI...HIGH OVERHEAD                  
LIKELY TO LIMIT MIXING...AND FINALLY LIGHT 950MB WINDS SHOULD                   
PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF AT LEAST A WEAK LAKE BREEZE.                             
NEXT ISSUE WILL BE PRECIP CHANCES ON THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE SLOWED               
SYSTEM SOME...ENOUGH TO REMOVE LIGHT PRECIP CHANCES FOR NW CWA                  
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ETA LOOKS TO BE THE MORE CONSISTENT OF THE MODELS              
IN TERMS OF STORM TRACK AND LIFT. WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MIND...WILL              
LEAN TOWARD ETA SOLUTION. LIMITING FACTOR AS FAR AS PRECIP IS                   
CONCERNED PER ETA...IS LIMITED MOISTURE WITH LOW PUSHING THROUGH                
CWA. PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS. WILL CARRY CHANCE OF                    
SHRA-BOTH ETA AND GFS THICKNESSES WOULD SUPPORT RAIN. AS LOW PULLS              
OUT...ETA WANTS TO SWING UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF ACROSS THE                          
REGION...WHILE GFS STREAMS A RIBBON OF CHANNELED VORTICITY ACROSS               
CWA. WILL LINGER THURSDAY PRECIP INTO THURSDAY EVENING...THEN HOLD              
DRY.

WILL THERE BE SNOWFLAKES ON YOUR EASTER BONNET. THAT AMONG OTHER                
ITEMS CONFRONTS US HERE. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN EVOLVING LONG              
WAVE TROUGH TO THE WEST OF US DURING THE PERIOD...WITH GFS CUTTING              
OFF SYSTEM INTO UPPER LOW ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST LATE IN THE                  
PERIOD.                                                                         
DOMINATING FEATURE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WILL BE STRONG ARCTIC HIGH              
PRESSURE THAT WILL CROSS CANADA...PROVIDING CWA WITH DRY NORTHEAST              
FLOW. COLD AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE CWA AS THE HIGH SWINGS THROUGH              
CANADA...WITH 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO -8C SUNDAY /EASTER/ MORNING.              
CLIMO IS AROUND 1C. GFS HAS HAD DIFFICULTY RESOLVING PRECIP CHANCES             
ACROSS CWA...WITH CURRENT GFS/CANADIAN PRECIP ENSEMBLES OFFERING                
LITTLE SUPPORT FOR PRECIP ON SUNDAY. WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY...BUT                 
NOTE...THAT IF GFS WERE TO VERIFY...SOME SNOWFLAKES COULD FLY ON                
EASTER. MOVING INTO MONDAY-TUESDAY PERIOD...STILL DIFFERENCES IN                
MODELS...AND AMONG MODELS. GFS PUSHES POTENT SURFACE LOW RIGHT

EXTRAPOLATION ARGUES FOR A SOLUTION MORE IN LINE WITH YESTERDAY/S               
GFS. GFS PRECIP ENSEMBLES DO POINT TO AT LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR                  
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. WITH THIS IN MIND WILL CALL FOR CHANCE                     
RAIN/SNOW MONDAY...THEN ALL RAIN MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. WITH

CANADIAN MARITIMES. SHRTWV THAT BROUGHT RAIN TO LOWER MI THIS                   
MORNING INTO EARLY THIS AFTERNOON NOW OVER LAKE MICHIGAN. VISIBLE

THE SHRTWV MOVES CLOSER. ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHRTWV WAS A 1008             
MB SURFACE LOW WHICH AT 18Z WAS LOCATED NEAR SAGINAW BAY. BEHIND THE

DOMINATING FEATURE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WILL BE STRONG ARCTIC HIGH

CANADA...WITH 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO -8C SUNDAY /EASTER/ MORNING.              
CLIMO IS AROUND 1C. GFS HAS HAD DIFFICULTY RESOLVING PRECIP CHANCES

UPDATE SENT OUT...MAINLY TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING. FORECAST LOOKS              
TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE. TWEAKED TEMPS DOWN ACROSS THE MIDDLE PART OF               
THE CWA...AS CLOUDS AND SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS PERSIST THOUGH MOST             
OF THE AFTERNOON. CLEARING NOW BEGINNING TO WORK INTO WESTERN                   
NORTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN...AS TEMPERATURES HAVE CLIMBED WELL INTO THE            
50S WITH SUNSHINE ACROSS WISCONSIN. GOOD DRYING INDICATED ON THE                
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WORKING INTO THE U.P.                                       
TEMPERATURES HAVE ALSO CLIMBED INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S ACROSS                 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST LOWER MICHIGAN WITH SOME SUNSHINE. TEMPERATURES               
SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH THE UPPER 50S ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF              
THE CWA BEFORE THE WEAKENING LINE OF LIGHT SHOWERS SAGS SOUTH.                  
ACROSS THE TRI-CITIES REGION...BANKING ON SOME SUNSHINE LATE                    
IN THE DAY...WHICH WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE MID 50S.  THE              
TOUGHEST CALL FOR TEMPS REMAINS ALONG THE M-59 CORRIDOR AND THUMB               
REGION WHERE CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THE LONGEST. EVEN WITH              
CLOUDS...EXPECT TEMPS TO MAKE AT LEAST 50 DEGREES LATE TODAY AS THE             
LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION CONTINUES.                                             
SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS WILL LIKELY BE OVER IN THE TRI-CITIES REGION

.DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 315 AM...                                                 
SHORT WAVE TROF WAS APPROACHING THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND                     
APPEARANCE ON THE H2O VAPOR LOOP THIS MORNING IS LESS THAN                      
IMPRESSIVE.  NOT MUCH UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WITH SATELLITE DERIVED                
WINDS ON THE ORDER OF 50KTS OR LESS.  RADAR MOSAICS SHOW AN                     
INCREASING AREA OF PRECIPITATION FROM THE DOOR PENINSULA INTO THE               
U.P. THANKS TO AN AXIS OF LLJ/THETA-E ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT             
295-300K SURFACES PER THE LATEST ANALYSIS FROM THE RUC.  THIS WILL              
BE OUR FIRST FORECAST CHALLENGE TO BE FOLLOWED BY ADDITIONAL SHORT              
WAVES IN OUR NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME TOWARD THE LATTER HALF OF THIS               
WEEK.                                                                           
PWAT/S ACROSS THE STATE ARE QUITE LOW PER 00Z RAOBS, ON THE ORDER OF            
A QUARTER OF AN INCH.  AS UPSTREAM PRECIP APPROACHES THE DRY AIR                
MASS, CEILINGS ARE DROPPING BUT NOT MUCH LESS THAN 4500 FEET WITH               
VISIBILITIES GENERALLY AT THE 10SM.  SOUTH OF THE MAIN AREA OF                  
PRECIP IT APPEARS PLENTY OF VIRGA AS GRB 00Z SOUNDING IS QUITE                  
DRY... EVEN DRIER ACROSS ILLINOIS.  MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE              
APPROACH OF THIS TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUT PRECIP CHANCES              
APPEAR TO BE ON THE DECREASE.  CASE AND POINT, THETA-E ADVECTION                
FIELDS BECOME DIS-ORIENTED LATER THIS MORNING AS DOES OMEGA PATTERN             
WEAKENING.  HOURLY BUFKIT PROFILES VIA THE ETA SHOW DRY AIR HANGING             
ON BELOW 5K FEET THROUGH THE DAY DESPITE ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS                    
INDICATING GOOD UPGLIDE AND CPD/S LESS THAN 10MBS.  FOR CONSISTENCY,            
AND AFTER COLLABORATION, WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SCATTERED SHOWERS            
NORTH OF I69 WHERE EXPECTED MOISTURE PROFILES REMAINS DEEP ENOUGH               
AND DROP OFF THE POPS FURTHER SOUTH TOWARD THE BORDER WHERE ISOLATED            
SHOWERS WILL BE IN THE GRIDS.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE ANOTHER ISSUE AS            
UPSTREAM HIGHS IN ADVANCE OF THIS FRONT WERE INTO THE 70S (THEY DID             
HAVE MORE SUNSHINE AND THERMAL FIELDS WERE WARMER).  WHILE WE WILL              
NOT REACH THOSE VALUES, THINKING WAS TO RAISE OUR GRIDS CLOSER THE              
MET GUIDANCE NUMBERS WHICH SUPPORTS AROUND 60F.                                 
SUBSIDENCE AND DRY AIR WORK INTO THE STATE TONIGHT AS FRONT CLEARS              
THE SOUTHERN MICHIGAN BORDER EARLY THIS EVENING.  SOUNDINGS SUPPORT             
PLENTY OF DRY AIR ALOFT BUT, ONCE AGAIN, THEY HINT AT LOW LEVEL                 
STRATUS DEVELOPING/ADVECTING ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA.  ETA40 BOUNDARY            
LAYER AND 30AGL CPD/S DROP BELOW 10MBS TOWARD 06Z WITH NORTHWEST                
FLOW AT THE SURFACE AROUND 10 KNOTS.  SO IT SEEMS FOG SHOULD NOT BE             
THE ISSUE, BUT LOW CLOUDS WHERE WE MIGHT ON THE BORDERLINE OF                   
MVFR/IFR CEILINGS.  WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THIS WITH A MOCLOUDY SKY                
EVOLVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN 2/3RDS OF THE CWA OVERNIGHT.                       
ILL-DEFINED HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE STATE ON                  
WEDNESDAY WHERE ANY LOW CLOUDS BURNING OFF LEAVING BY SOME                      
SUNSHINE.  MIXING LAYER HEIGHTS SUPPORT HIGHS CLIMBING INTO THE 50S             
AND WITH SOME SUNSHINE, THIS SHOULD BE ATTAINABLE WHICH WOULD AGREE             
CLOSER THE MAV/S AND SOME BLEND OF THE MET/S.                                   
HOW TO HANDLE THE NEXT SYSTEM IN OUR NORTHWEST FLOW IS ANYONE/S                 
GUESS WITH MODELS CONSENSUS SHOWING CLOUDS INCREASING WEDNESDAY                 
NIGHT.  THE GFS POINTS TOWARD TWO DISTINCT AREAS OF LIFT THURSDAY               
WHICH BISECTS THE CWA.  THE ETA IS MORE CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE                 
NORTHERN WAVE WHICH MAKES MORE SENSE GIVEN LOCATION OF UPPER JET.               
THEN THERE IS THE ETA-XX, WHICH HAS DONE WELL OF LATE, WEAKENS THE              
NORTHERN WAVE IN FAVOR OF SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS ACROSS THE OHIO                  
VALLEY.  GIVEN A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS AND EXPECTED TEMPERATURE                  
PROFILES, WE WILL LEAVE CURRENTS GRIDS INTACT WITH RAIN/SNOW LINE               
NORTH OF M59.                                                                   
LOOKING AHEAD...PLENTY TO WATCH FOR AS WE AWAIT TO SEE HOW PATTERN              
EVOLVES WITH UPPER LOW CLOSING OFF SOMEWHERE OVER THE PLAINS AND

THIRDS OF THE CWA ALLOWING FOR RELATIVELY WARM TEMPS TO BE                      
REALIZED, BUT NOT AS WARM AS YESTERDAY. THE PROGGED MOTION                      
APPEARS REASONABLE BASED ON CURRENT ISALLOBARIC TRENDS. A                       
STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST TONIGHT                    
ASSOCIATED WITH A MID-LVL S/WV TROUGH THAT WILL PASS NORTH OF NRN               
IL. THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE LOW- AND MID-LVL KINEMATIC AND                     
THERMO FIELDS SUPPORT THE INHERITED HIGHER SHRA POPS ACROSS THE                 
NRN PORTION OF THE CWA. THE SHRA SHOULD BE EAST OF THE CWA AROUND

HAVE FOLLOWED THE ETA AND EC FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED

PHASING OF THE UPR-LVL LOW CURRENTLY PARKED OVER THE TX PHNDL/WRN               
OK, WITH THE SRN BRANCH OF THE POLAR JET. HOWEVER, FOR THE LATER

AMPLIFYING L/WV TROUGH COMPOUNDED BY AN UPR-LVL LOW THAT WILL                   
LIFT OUT OF THE CNTRL ROCKIES/CNTRL PLAINS AND ACROSS THE OH                    
VALLEY EARLY IN THE WEEKEND. THE INHERITED POPS AND PRECIP                      
TYPES APPEAR REASONABLE BASED ON THE RECENT 00Z GUIDANCE...SOME                 
QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH PRECIP WILL BE REALIZED GIVEN THE AMOUNT                
OF DRY AIR THAT WILL BE IN PLACE...THE SRN PORTION OF THE CWA                   
WOULD BE FAVORED FOR PRECIP BASED ON THE PROGGED TRACK OF THE                   
CNTRL PLAINS LOW. HAVE LOWERED MIN/MAX TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND                    
INTO MONDAY BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED AIRMASS. THE LATEST MEX                    
HAS MOVED TOWARD A COLDER SOLUTION AS WELL. RELATIVELY COLD AND                 
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD PERSIST INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT                  
WEEK AS THE L/WV TROUGH IS MAINTAINED OVER THE REGION. TEMPS

QUICK UPDATE THIS EVENING TO FRESHEN ZFP WORDING BY REMOVING EARLY              
EVENING POPS. DECIDED TO LEAVE SOME SPRINKLES IN SOUTHERN COUNTIES              
UNTIL FRONT COMPLETELY CLEARS THAT AREA. STILL SOME CLOUDS SEEN ON              
SATELLITE WITH THIS FRONT AND RUC40 GENERATING SOME DECENT 850MB                
OMEGA BEFORE 06Z. HOWEVER...LOWER LEVELS QUITE DRY AND WITHOUT                  
SIGNIFICANT FORCING JUST DO NOT SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF MEASURABLE               
PCPN OCCURING. DECIDED TO RAISE MAX TEMPS FOR WED BASED ON OBJECTIVE            
GUIDANCE TRENDS LAST SEVERAL RUNS AND UPSTREAM TEMPERATURES BEHIND              
COLD FRONT TODAY. EXPERIMENTAL WAM NUMBERS ALSO SUPPORTING WARMER               
TEMPERATURES. BIGGEST CHANGE WAS TO CONFINE LAKE EFFECTS ON                     
TEMPERATURE CLOSER TO LAKE MICHIGAN. LOW LEVEL WINDS SHOULD BE MORE             
NORTHEAST AND LIGHT BUT STILL EXPECT A LAKE BREEZE TO DEVELOP...JUST            
NOT MOVE INLAND AS MUCH AS PREVIOUS GRIDS INDICATED. THUS SBN                   
TEMPERATURE WILL BE WARMER.                                                     
&&

SHORT TERM...                                                                   
A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA LATE THIS                     
AFTERNOON/EVENING. A FEW RAIN SHOWERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT             
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH OUR MICHIGAN                   
COUNTIES. NOT EXPECTING MUCH RAIN FROM THIS FRONT. NOT VERY MANY                
CLOUDS CURRENTLY IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS...MOST OF THE CLOUDS ARE OVER             
LAKE MICHIGAN AND SOUTHERN MICHIGAN. JUST KEPT THE LOW CHANCE POPS              
WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...THE RAIN CHANCES              
WILL END AS DRIER AIR IS BEHIND THE FRONT. ALSO WINDS TONIGHT WILL              
TURN TO THE NORTH AND THEN TO THE NORTHEAST TOMORROW MORNING. 12Z               
TOMORROW MORNING THE MODELS HAVE THE FRONT OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA AND            
THEN DURING THE DAY MOVE IT SOUTH OF THE STATE AS HIGH PRESSURE                 
MOVES IN. TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO AROUND 40 ACROSS OUR CWA AND                
THEN RISE TO AROUND 60 TOMORROW...EXCEPT AREAS NEAR LAKE MICHIGAN               
WILL BE COOLER.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY...OVERALL...EXPECT A COOL AND              
GENERALLY DRY PATTERN TO DOMINATE THE PERIOD. WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR            
SHOWERS IN LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS ANOTHER COOL FRONT              
PASSES...BUT ONCE AGAIN WITH MOISTURE LIMITED AND A WEAK FRONT...DO             
NOT EXPECT MUCH RAIN. AFTER THURSDAY...HAVE KEPT THE FORECAST DRY               
AND COOL WITH TEMPS BELOW NORMAL. GFS OF RECENT HAS HAD POOR RUN TO             
RUN CONSISTENCY WHICH IS APPARENT IN MEX MOS FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH               
TEMPS AND POPS. BUT BASIC UPPER AIR PATTERN OF A DEVELOPING TROF                
OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS BY EARLY NEXT WEEK ALONG WITH A STRONG SFC               
RIDGE OVER CENTRAL CANADA IS PREEMINENT. EARLIER RUNS OF THE GFS WAS            
SUGGESTING A SURFACE WAVE WOULD SPREAD AT LEAST SOME PRECIPITATION              
OVER THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA THIS WEEKEND...BUT GIVEN DOMINANT            
NORTH TO NORTHEAST SFC FLOW AND RUN TO RUN INCONSISTENCIES OF THE               
GFS AND ALSO TREND OF THE GFS TO OVER FORECAST PRECIPITATION IN THE             
NORTHERN PART OF STORM SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF DRY AIR                    
ADVECTING IN THE LOWER LAYERS...HAVE KEEP THE FORECAST DRY. 12Z GFS             
SHOWED VERY COOL TEMPS SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY OF -4C OR COLDER AT             
850 MB. HAVE HIGH BASICALLY 45 TO 50 THROUGH THE PERIOD TO MATCH                
THESE COOL TEMPS. 12Z GFS EXTENDED WAS EVEN SLOWER WITH MAJOR TROF              
EJECTING OUT OF THE PLAINS EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS RUN FROM LAST NIGHT             
WAS BRINGING PRECIPITATION IN MONDAY...BUT NEW 12Z RUN WAS DRY                  
THROUGH TUESDAY. GIVEN TENDENCY FOR GFS TO BE TOO FAST WITH HIGHLY              
AMPLIFIED SYSTEMS HAVE OPTED TO KEEP TUESDAY DRY AS THIS REASONING              
SUGGESTS BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WOULD BE AFTER TUESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST PROBLEMS WILL BE TIMING OF PRECIPITATION AND             
THE HIGH TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD. SATELLITE SHOWING A BROAD             
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PACIFIC WHICH IS BEING                
ACHORED BY LOW IN THE GULF OF ALASKA. RIDGING TO THE EAST OF THIS               
TROUGH IS SHOVING NEXT SYSTEM TOWARD THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. UPPER                
SYSTEM OVER TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA IS MAKING SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD THE               
EAST. ONE SHORTWAVE MOVING TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES WILL PUSH ANOTHER             
WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS OUR AREA TODAY.                                          
DUE TO MODEL GRAPHIC DATA PROBLEMS WILL BE USING THE UKMET AND RUC              
FOR THIS PACKAGE.                                                               
FOR TODAY/TONIGHT...PRECIPITATION HAS ENDED OVER THE AREA.                      
PRECIPITATION FORMED IN DEFORMATION ZONE TO THE NORTH OF SOUTHERN               
PLAINS LOW. ALREADY RECEIVED A REPORT OF 1.3 INCHES OF RAINFALL                 
FROM THE NORTHEAST PORTION OF FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE AND UPPER AIR            
ANALYSIS INDICATE DRIER AIR UPSTREAM AS RIDGING PUSHES IN BEHIND                
EXITING SYSTEM. SHORTWAVE SEEN UPSTREAM IS PRODUCING MID CLOUDS                 
WITH A LITTLE LIGHT PRECIP/SPRINKLES. THE RUC CATCHES THIS                      
AREA NICELY AND WEAKENS IT AS IT GETS CLOSER. FRONTAL PUSH DOES NOT             
LOOK TO BE THAT STRONG AS WELL. WILL GET DOWNSLOPING WIND IN ADVANCE            
OF BOUNDARY PLUS LOWER DEWPOINTS WILL BE BROUGHT IN BEHIND FRONT.               
THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION LOOKS TO BE OVER COLORADO WHERE               
THE UPSLOPE AND DYNAMICS ARE THE BEST. WILL ONLY HAVE ISOLATED                  
SHOWERS FOR TODAY WITH LINGERING PRECIPITATION EARLY THIS EVENING               
OVER SOUTHERN AND SOUTHWEST SECTIONS. THEN SHOULD HAVE SOME PATCHY              
FOG DUE TO SOME UPSLOPE AND POSSIBLY WET GROUND. FOR TODAY WILL HAVE            
PATCHY FOG EARLY. CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR OUT EARLY AND WILL HAVE                   
DOWNSLOPE AND ENOUGH SUN TO ALLOW MAXES TO BE THE WARMEST THEY WILL             
BE FOR A FEW DAYS. DOES NOT LOOK TO BE A LOT OF COOLING WITH THIS               
FRONT WITH 850 MB ANALYSIS SHOWING LITTLE DROP OFF ON TEMPS BEHIND              
IT. TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO WARMER IN MONTANA THAN PORTIONS OF THE                
SOUTHERN PLAINS AT THIS TIME. PLAN ON GOING CLOSE TO THE WARMER                 
GUIDANCE.                                                                       
FOR THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...NEXT SHORTAVE STARTS MOVING INTO AREA                
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. WILL ALSO HAVE DECENT EASTERLY UPSLOPE WINDS                
FEEDING MOISTURE INTO THIS SYSTEM. SHORTWAVE LOOKS TO TAKE ON A                 
LITTLE NEGATIVE TILT. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BECOME WIDESPREAD                    
THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY. ALSO LOOK TO HAVE DECENT               
WARM AIR ADVECTION/UPGLIDE OVER THE TOP OF THE COLD DOME THROUGH                
THIS ENTIRE TIME. THEN NEXT SHORTWAVE MOVES IN LATE FRIDAY. WILL                
START OUT WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE WEST ON THURSDAY. THEN WILL               
HAVE HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WITH                      
EVERYTHING POINTING TO NOT MUCH WARMING OCCURING DURING BOTH DAYS...            
WILL GO NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW THE GUIDANCE. MINS THURSDAY NIGHT                
WILL BE MILD WITH CLOUDS...UPSLOPE...AND PRECIPITATION.                         
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH DAY 7...WITH MODEL DATA PROBLEMS WILL NOT              
BE UPDATING THIS PERIOD. CURRENT ZONES DO HAVE BOTH RAIN AND SNOW               
MENTIONED AND THAT LOOKS GOOD FOR NOW. DAY CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE A

WEAK GRADIENT FLOW ACROSS EASTERN 2/3RDS OF THE CONUS PER LATEST                
SURFACE ANALYSIS.  YESTERDAYS WEAK WAVE RESULTED WITH LITTLE IN THE             
RAIN ADDING IN THE BUCKET AS THIS WAVE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND PUSH             
OFFSHORE.  FURTHER UPSTREAM, YET ANOTHER WAVE NOW MOVING INTO NORTH             
DAKOTA.  THIS WAVE APPEARS TO BE PACKING A LITTLE MORE OF A PUNCH               
WITH H2O VAPOR REPRESENTATION INDICATING A SMALL COMMA HEAD AND                 
SATELLITE DERIVED WINDS INDICATING JET COUPLING WITH 70-80 KNTS.                
THIS HAS RESULTED IN CONVECTION WITH LIGHTNING STRIKES JUST NORTH OF            
THE BORDER AS OF 06Z.  INBETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS, HIGH PRESSURE WHICH             
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE STATE TODAY.  INITIALIZATION WAS FAIRLY GOOD,

BORDERLINE MVFR/IFR CEILINGS.  LATEST OPERATIONAL MESOSCALE MODELS              
ARE NOT HANDLING THIS WELL BUT TAQ RUC (EXPERIMENTAL) IS DOING                  
BETTER WHICH BRINGS THE STRATUS DECK SOUTH ACROSS BAY, TUSCOLA,                 
HURON, SANILAC AND PORTIONS OF ST CLAIR COUNTY BEFORE MIXING OUT                
AROUND 15Z.  OUTSIDE OF THIS, SKIES TODAY SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.               
SOME HIGH/MID LEVEL MOISTURE FROM UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS            
AND APPROACH OF UPSTREAM WAVE MAY BRING MORE CLOUDS THIS                        
AFTERNOON...BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT SHOULD A MORE SUN THAN CLOUDS                
DAY.  BASED ON UPSTREAM TEMPS WHICH WERE IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER             
70S...FOLLOWING THOSE THICKNESSES WOULD TAKE MOST OF THIS SPRINGLIKE            
AIR SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  WITH SURFACE HIGH MOVING ACROSS,               
GRADIENT WILL BE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE MIXING WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MID               
50S AWAY FROM THE WATER.  IT WILL BE A BIT COOLER NEAR THE LAKES AS             
LOCAL CHARTS SHOW LAKE BREEZES SETTING UP EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WITH             
LIGHT 925/950MB WINDS.                                                          
TONIGHT...                                                                      
LAKE BREEZE ACTIVITY WILL ABATE THIS EVENING AS UPSTREAM WAVE BEGINS            
IT APPROACH ON THE GREAT LAKES REGION.  AT THIS POINT, MODELS DO                
DIVERGE WITH RESPECT TO PLACEMENT OF LIFT, MOISTURE AND UPPER LEVEL             
SUPPORT.  GIVEN UPSTREAM SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM, WE WOULD HAVE TO                 
FAVOR THE GFS TIMING.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ              
RUC WHICH BRINGS US TO ADD PRECIP TO THE GRIDS LATE TONIGHT.                    
Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE IS IMPRESSIVE AND COINCIDES WITH OMEGA PATTERN             
LATE TONIGHT FOR SCATTERED POPS IN THE GRIDS.  WITH THE INCREASE IN             
THE CLOUD COVER, TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD UP A BIT INTO THE MID-UPPER             
30S.                                                                            
THURSDAY...                                                                     
WE SHOULD START THE DAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AS Q-VECTOR                      
CONVERGENCE/OMEGA AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT SLIDE TO THE EAST BY LATE                
MORNING.  SURFACE FEATURES WILL BE TOUGH TO PIN DOWN WITH WEAK LOW              
PASSING ACROSS THE LOWER HALF OF THE STATE LEAVING BEHIND SURFACE               
TROF/COLD FRONT ACROSS THE REGION.  HERE IS WHERE SOME MAJOR                    
DIFFERENCES OCCUR AS THE ETA SWINGS A DRY SLOT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN              
COUNTIES WHILE THE GFS IS FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS             
WOULD AGREE WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ RUC TO KEEP THE CLOUDS AND THE               
CHANCE FOR LIGHT SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.  WITH            
THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP, WE WILL NEED TO BRING DOWN OUR             
EXPECTED MAX TEMPS A BIT WITH THE HIGHER VALUES POSSIBLE FROM                   
ARB-DTW SOUTHWARD.                                                              
THURSDAY NIGHT...                                                               
THIS CAN PROVE TO BE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THE FORECAST AND            
WILL LIKELY CHANGE.  LATEST GUIDANCE NOW POINTS TOWARD SHORT WAVE               
TROF TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CWA PUSHING SURFACE COLD FRONT                
SOUTH.  MOISTURE COLUMN IS MORE MOIST THIS RUN WITH GFS OMEGA FIELDS            
FOCUSING ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA.  WITH SOME SURFACE                
CONVERGENCE AND THE CHANCE FOR SOME MID LEVEL WAVE AFFECTING THE                
NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME, WE WILL BRING IN A CHANCE FOR A RAIN/SNOW MIX            
NORTH WHERE THICKNESSES AND SOUNDINGS ARE BORDERLINE...AND A BIT                
WARMER SOUTH FOR PRIMARILY RAIN.  AGAIN, CONFIDENCE IN THIS SOLUTION            
IS POOR AND WILL LIKELY BE MODIFIED.                                            
FRIDAY...                                                                       
WE FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE IN                 
PLACE.  WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DRY FORECAST BUT KEEP THE CLOUD               
FESTIVAL GOING.  TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN 45 AND 50            
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.                                                            
LOOKING AHEAD OFFERS TOO MANY CHALLENGES TO MENTION.  HOWEVER, IN               
SUMMARY THE 00Z GUIDANCE TAKES GULF LOW AND TRACKS THIS SYSTEM                  
SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION AND AFFECT THE EAST COAST.  THIS IS                     
SUPPORTED BY THE 00Z CANADIAN WHICH KEEPS THE CWA UNDER HIGHER                  
SURFACE PRESSURES BUT TROFINESS ALOFT.

355 AM EDT WED APR 7 2004                                                       
.DISCUSSION...                                                                  
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS PRECIPITATION TONIGHT.                                 
CURRENT WEATHER...07Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS            
SHOWED NW FLOW ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF NORTH AMERICA...WITH A RIDGE            
IN WESTERN CANADA AND A TROUGH OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. THE MAIN            
FEATURE WITHIN THE NW FLOW THAT WILL AFFECT UPPER MICHIGAN WAS A                
SHRTWV LOCATED NEAR MINOT NORTH DAKOTA. THIS SHRTWV...WITH 500MB                
TEMPS OF -26 TO -28C AND 700-500MB LAPSE RATES OF 7.5C/KM WITH IT               
PER DERIVED DATA FROM THE RUC...HAS AIDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME            
-TSRA OVER SE SASKATCHEWAN. 00Z RAOBS SHOWED A DEVELOPING BAROCLINIC            
ZONE AT 850MB WITH THE NORTH DAKOTA SHRTWV...WITH TEMPS OF +2C AT               
CALGARY ALBERTA AND +12C AT GLASGOW MONTANA. ASSOCIATED WITH THE                
BAROCLINIC ZONE WAS AN 80 KT WESTERLY JET AT 250MB NEAR MINOT (AGAIN            
OBSERVED AT 00Z) WITH A 90 KT NORTHWEST JET MOVING THROUGH CALGARY.             
UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION REFLECTED AT THE                  
SURFACE WITH PRESSURE FALLS OVER NORTH DAKOTA. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH            
PRESSURE WAS LOCATED OVER NORTHERN WISCONSIN. 11-3.9 UM SATELLITE               
IMAGERY SHOWED CLEAR SKIES WITH THE HIGH...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO             
FALL INTO THE 30S. THE EXCEPTION IS ALONG THE KEWEENAW PENINSULA                
WHERE TEMPS REMAIN IN THE MID 40S BECAUSE OF WINDS STAYING UP THERE.            
LIGHT WINDS OVER THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND CLEAR SKEIS HAS              
ALLOWED SOME PATCHY FOG TO FORM. THE EXCEPTION TO THE CLEAR SKIES IS            
OVER EASTERN UPPER MICHIGAN WHERE LAKE STRATUS CLOUDS THAT FORMED               
YESTERDAY REMAIN.                                                               
TODAY...DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER THE DAKOTAS IS PROGGED TO HEAD              
TO THE EAST...REACHING NW WISCONSIN BY 00Z. AHEAD OF THE LOW...HIGH             
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS UPPER MICHIGAN...WHICH CAN ALREADY BE               
SEEN MOVING THROUGH NORTH DAKOTA AND NORTHERN MN. SOLAR INSOLATION              
WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED BY THE HIGH CLOUDS...BUT SHOULD STILL BE               
STRONG ENOUGH TO MIX OUT ANY PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING. ANY                       
PRECIPIATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHRTWV APPEARS TO HOLD OFF AT LEAST            
UNTIL EVENING...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DRY AIR MASS SEEN ON THE 00Z               
GRB AND MPX SOUNDINGS. TEMPS A LITTLE MORE TRICKY NOW THAT THE                  
SUNLIGHT IS MUCH STRONGER. THIS IS REFLECTED IN MAV GUIDANCE ALONG              
THE WISCONSIN BORDER SHOWING TEMPS IN THE LOW 50S. LOOKING AT 850MB             
TEMPS...ETA NEVER SHOWS THEM DROPPING BELOW +2C OVER THE CWA.                   
THEREFORE...WILL UP TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO. WITH A WEAK PRESSURE                 
GRADIENT...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE LAKE BREEZES SET UP AGAIN.             
TONIGHT...SFC LOW AND SHRTWV PASSES ACROSS THE CITY OF GREEN BAY                
INTO WESTERN LOWER MI BY 12Z THU PER ETA/GFS. BY THIS TIME ENOUGH               
MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL HAVE OCCURRED TO BRING A BAND OF                        
PRECIPITATION INTO THE CWA AHEAD OF THE SFC LOW. HAVE ALSO ADDED THE            
MENTION OF TS AFTER NOTICING THE POCKET OF STEEP 700-500MB LAPSE                
RATES AND SHOWALTER INDICES AROUND 0C MOVE OVER THE WEST HALF OF                
UPPER MI ACCORDING TO THE ETA. BOTH THE GFS AND ETA INDICATE AN                 
INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING BACK INTO WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR AS THE SFC            
LOW MOVES INTO LOWER MI...WHICH WILL BE USED AS A FORCING MECHANISM             
FOR MORE PRECIPITATION. ANOTHER AID TO THE FORCING WILL BE UPPER                
DIVERGENCE IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF A 100 KT JET OVER WISCONSIN               
(THE JET CURRENTLY OVER CALGARY). AS FOR TYPE...IT APPEARS THAT                 
THERE WILL BE ENOUGH WARM AIR TO KEEP THINGS AS RAIN IN THE                     
EVENING...BUT AS COLDER AIR IS ADVECTED IN FROM THE WEST AND                    
NORTH...THE PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. WILL MODIFY THE             
WX GRIDS TO REFLECT TIMING AND ORIENTATION OF THE PRECIPTATION. AS              
FOR LOWS...CLOUD COVER WILL HELP KEEP TEMPS UP HOWEVER COLD AIR                 
ADVECTION AS MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BRING TEMPS DOWN WITH THE PASSING             
OF THE LOW. WILL USE MAV GUIDANCE FOR LOWS.                                     
THURSDAY...INVERTED TROUGH SAGS SOUTHWARD ACROSS UPPER MICHIGAN AS              
500MB AND 850MB FLOW BECOMES MORE NORTHERLY AND THE SFC LOW MOVES               
TOWARDS NEW YORK. THE NORTHERLY FLOW WILL DROP 850MB TEMPS TO -4 TO             
-6C BY 21Z. SO TEMPS WILL DEFINITELY BE COOLER THAN TODAY...IN THE              
MID 30S. ALONG WITH THE COLD ADVECTION...SNOW WILL BE OCCURRING IN              
THE MORNING ALONG THE INVERTED TROUGH. EXPECTING THE SNOW TO                    
DIMINISH DURING THE AFTERNOON AS MUCH OF THE DYNAMICS HEAD OFF TO               
THE EAST AND DRY AIR GETS ADVECTED IN FROM THE NORTH.                           
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...AS A BROAD 500MB TROUGH FORMES OVER NEW             
ENGLAND...COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES UNDER NORTHERLY FLOW...WITH              
850MB TEMPS FALLING TO -10 TO -12C BY 12Z FRI AND THEN REMAINING                
STEADY THROUGH 00Z SAT. GFS IS A FEW DEGREES COLDER...BUT WITH ITS              
LOW BIAS...TEND TO BELIEVE THE ETA MORE. LACK OF ANY FORCING IN THE             
COLD ADVECTION REGIME PRECLUDES ANY MENTIONING OF PRECIPITATION.                
DESPITE THE COOLING IN 850MB TEMPS...LAKE EFFECT POTENTIAL SEEMS                
MINIMAL TOO WITH DELTA-T/S AROUND 13C AND INVERSION HEIGHTS SITTING             
BETWEEN 3000 AND 4000 FT. BEST LOCATION OF SEEING ANY FLURRIES OR               
SNOW SHOWERS WOULD OCCUR OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL U.P. WHERE THE                  
NORTHERLY SURFACE WINDS UPSLOPE. ONLY ADJUSTMENT WILL BE TO LOWER               
POPS ON FRIDAY AS OVERALL SETUP DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLE FOR SNOW.

WEAK GRADIENT FLOW ACROSS EASTERN 2/3RDS OF THE CONUS PER LATEST                
SURFACE ANALYSIS.  YESTERDAYS WEAK WAVE RESULTED WITH LITTLE IN THE

OFFSHORE.  FURTHER UPSTREAM, YET ANOTHER WAVE NOW MOVING INTO NORTH             
DAKOTA.  THIS WAVE APPEARS TO BE PACKING A LITTLE MORE OF A PUNCH               
WITH H2O VAPOR REPRESENTATION INDICATING A SMALL COMMA HEAD AND                 
SATELLITE DERIVED WINDS INDICATING JET COUPLING WITH 70-80 KNTS.                
THIS HAS RESULTED IN CONVECTION WITH LIGHTNING STRIKES JUST NORTH OF            
THE BORDER AS OF 06Z.  INBETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS, HIGH PRESSURE WHICH             
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE STATE TODAY.  INITIALIZATION WAS FAIRLY GOOD,              
ALTHOUGH, THE GFS APPEARS TO BE THE MODEL OF CHOICE AS WE LOOK                  
FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE.

IN A NUTSHELL, AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE HIGH SLIDES ACROSS THE STATE

ARE NOT HANDLING THIS WELL BUT TAQ RUC (EXPERIMENTAL) IS DOING                  
BETTER WHICH BRINGS THE STRATUS DECK SOUTH ACROSS BAY, TUSCOLA,                 
HURON, SANILAC AND PORTIONS OF ST CLAIR COUNTY BEFORE MIXING OUT                
AROUND 15Z.  OUTSIDE OF THIS, SKIES TODAY SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.               
SOME HIGH/MID LEVEL MOISTURE FROM UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS            
AND APPROACH OF UPSTREAM WAVE MAY BRING MORE CLOUDS THIS                        
AFTERNOON...BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT SHOULD A MORE SUN THAN CLOUDS                
DAY.  BASED ON UPSTREAM TEMPS WHICH WERE IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER             
70S...FOLLOWING THOSE THICKNESSES WOULD TAKE MOST OF THIS SPRINGLIKE            
AIR SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  WITH SURFACE HIGH MOVING ACROSS,               
GRADIENT WILL BE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE MIXING WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MID               
50S AWAY FROM THE WATER.  IT WILL BE A BIT COOLER NEAR THE LAKES AS             
LOCAL CHARTS SHOW LAKE BREEZES SETTING UP EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WITH

LAKE BREEZE ACTIVITY WILL ABATE THIS EVENING AS UPSTREAM WAVE BEGINS            
IT APPROACH ON THE GREAT LAKES REGION.  AT THIS POINT, MODELS DO                
DIVERGE WITH RESPECT TO PLACEMENT OF LIFT, MOISTURE AND UPPER LEVEL             
SUPPORT.  GIVEN UPSTREAM SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM, WE WOULD HAVE TO                 
FAVOR THE GFS TIMING.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ              
RUC WHICH BRINGS US TO ADD PRECIP TO THE GRIDS LATE TONIGHT.                    
Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE IS IMPRESSIVE AND COINCIDES WITH OMEGA PATTERN             
LATE TONIGHT FOR SCATTERED POPS IN THE GRIDS.  WITH THE INCREASE IN             
THE CLOUD COVER, TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD UP A BIT INTO THE MID-UPPER             
30S.

WE SHOULD START THE DAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AS Q-VECTOR                      
CONVERGENCE/OMEGA AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT SLIDE TO THE EAST BY LATE                
MORNING.  SURFACE FEATURES WILL BE TOUGH TO PIN DOWN WITH WEAK LOW              
PASSING ACROSS THE LOWER HALF OF THE STATE LEAVING BEHIND SURFACE               
TROF/COLD FRONT ACROSS THE REGION.  HERE IS WHERE SOME MAJOR                    
DIFFERENCES OCCUR AS THE ETA SWINGS A DRY SLOT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN              
COUNTIES WHILE THE GFS IS FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS             
WOULD AGREE WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ RUC TO KEEP THE CLOUDS AND THE               
CHANCE FOR LIGHT SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.  WITH            
THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP, WE WILL NEED TO BRING DOWN OUR             
EXPECTED MAX TEMPS A BIT WITH THE HIGHER VALUES POSSIBLE FROM                   
ARB-DTW SOUTHWARD.

THIS CAN PROVE TO BE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THE FORECAST AND            
WILL LIKELY CHANGE.  LATEST GUIDANCE NOW POINTS TOWARD SHORT WAVE               
TROF TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CWA PUSHING SURFACE COLD FRONT                
SOUTH.  MOISTURE COLUMN IS MORE MOIST THIS RUN WITH GFS OMEGA FIELDS            
FOCUSING ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA.  WITH SOME SURFACE                
CONVERGENCE AND THE CHANCE FOR SOME MID LEVEL WAVE AFFECTING THE                
NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME, WE WILL BRING IN A CHANCE FOR A RAIN/SNOW MIX            
NORTH WHERE THICKNESSES AND SOUNDINGS ARE BORDERLINE...AND A BIT                
WARMER SOUTH FOR PRIMARILY RAIN.  AGAIN, CONFIDENCE IN THIS SOLUTION            
IS POOR AND WILL LIKELY BE MODIFIED.                                            
FRIDAY...                                                                       
WE FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE IN                 
PLACE.  WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DRY FORECAST BUT KEEP THE CLOUD               
FESTIVAL GOING.  TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN 45 AND 50            
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.                                                            
LOOKING AHEAD OFFERS TOO MANY CHALLENGES TO MENTION.  HOWEVER, IN               
SUMMARY THE 00Z GUIDANCE TAKES GULF LOW AND TRACKS THIS SYSTEM                  
SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION AND AFFECT THE EAST COAST.  THIS IS                     
SUPPORTED BY THE 00Z CANADIAN WHICH KEEPS THE CWA UNDER HIGHER                  
SURFACE PRESSURES BUT TROFINESS ALOFT.

ANALYSIS INDICATE DRIER AIR UPSTREAM AS RIDGING PUSHES IN BEHIND                
EXITING SYSTEM. SHORTWAVE SEEN UPSTREAM IS PRODUCING MID CLOUDS                 
WITH A LITTLE LIGHT PRECIP/SPRINKLES. THE RUC CATCHES THIS

LOOK TO BE THAT STRONG AS WELL. WILL GET DOWNSLOPING WIND IN ADVANCE            
OF BOUNDARY PLUS LOWER DEWPOINTS WILL BE BROUGHT IN BEHIND FRONT.               
THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION LOOKS TO BE OVER COLORADO WHERE               
THE UPSLOPE AND DYNAMICS ARE THE BEST. WILL ONLY HAVE ISOLATED                  
SHOWERS FOR TODAY WITH LINGERING PRECIPITATION EARLY THIS EVENING

FOG DUE TO SOME UPSLOPE AND POSSIBLY WET GROUND. FOR TODAY WILL HAVE            
PATCHY FOG EARLY. CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR OUT EARLY AND WILL HAVE                   
DOWNSLOPE AND ENOUGH SUN TO ALLOW MAXES TO BE THE WARMEST THEY WILL

FEEDING MOISTURE INTO THIS SYSTEM. SHORTWAVE LOOKS TO TAKE ON A                 
LITTLE NEGATIVE TILT. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BECOME WIDESPREAD                    
THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY. ALSO LOOK TO HAVE DECENT               
WARM AIR ADVECTION/UPGLIDE OVER THE TOP OF THE COLD DOME THROUGH                
THIS ENTIRE TIME. THEN NEXT SHORTWAVE MOVES IN LATE FRIDAY. WILL                
START OUT WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE WEST ON THURSDAY. THEN WILL               
HAVE HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WITH                      
EVERYTHING POINTING TO NOT MUCH WARMING OCCURING DURING BOTH DAYS...            
WILL GO NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW THE GUIDANCE. MINS THURSDAY NIGHT                
WILL BE MILD WITH CLOUDS...UPSLOPE...AND PRECIPITATION.                         
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH DAY 7...WITH MODEL DATA PROBLEMS WILL NOT              
BE UPDATING THIS PERIOD. CURRENT ZONES DO HAVE BOTH RAIN AND SNOW               
MENTIONED AND THAT LOOKS GOOD FOR NOW. DAY CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE A             
CLOSER LOOK AT THIS.

THE PRIMARY CHANGE WITH THE MORNING UPDATE WAS TO HOLD ONTO                     
THE CLOUDS A LITTLE LONGER...MAINLY FOR THE NORTHEAST                           
COUNTIES.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CLOUDS WILL IMPACT                            
THE HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY AS STRONG APRIL SUNSHINE SHOULD                     
WARM THINGS UP INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S FOR MOST AREAS.                          
AREAS NEAR LAKE HURON WILL CERTAINLY BE COOLER WITH AN                          
EASTERLY COMPONENT TO THE THE WIND.                                             
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION...ISSUED AT 315 AM EDT                                              
WEAK GRADIENT FLOW ACROSS EASTERN 2/3RDS OF THE CONUS PER LATEST                
SURFACE ANALYSIS.  YESTERDAYS WEAK WAVE RESULTED WITH LITTLE IN THE             
RAIN ADDING IN THE BUCKET AS THIS WAVE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND PUSH             
OFFSHORE.  FURTHER UPSTREAM, YET ANOTHER WAVE NOW MOVING INTO NORTH             
DAKOTA.  THIS WAVE APPEARS TO BE PACKING A LITTLE MORE OF A PUNCH               
WITH H2O VAPOR REPRESENTATION INDICATING A SMALL COMMA HEAD AND                 
SATELLITE DERIVED WINDS INDICATING JET COUPLING WITH 70-80 KNTS.                
THIS HAS RESULTED IN CONVECTION WITH LIGHTNING STRIKES JUST NORTH OF            
THE BORDER AS OF 06Z.  INBETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS, HIGH PRESSURE WHICH             
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE STATE TODAY.  INITIALIZATION WAS FAIRLY GOOD,              
ALTHOUGH, THE GFS APPEARS TO BE THE MODEL OF CHOICE AS WE LOOK                  
FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE.                                                        
TODAY...                                                                        
IN A NUTSHELL, AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE HIGH SLIDES ACROSS THE STATE              
TODAY WITH TRANQUIL CONDITIONS.  BUT WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR STRATUS            
DECK WHICH IS PROGRESSING SOUTHEAST ACROSS SAGINAW BAY/THUMB WITH               
BORDERLINE MVFR/IFR CEILINGS.  LATEST OPERATIONAL MESOSCALE MODELS              
ARE NOT HANDLING THIS WELL BUT TAQ RUC (EXPERIMENTAL) IS DOING                  
BETTER WHICH BRINGS THE STRATUS DECK SOUTH ACROSS BAY, TUSCOLA,                 
HURON, SANILAC AND PORTIONS OF ST CLAIR COUNTY BEFORE MIXING OUT                
AROUND 15Z.  OUTSIDE OF THIS, SKIES TODAY SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.               
SOME HIGH/MID LEVEL MOISTURE FROM UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS            
AND APPROACH OF UPSTREAM WAVE MAY BRING MORE CLOUDS THIS                        
AFTERNOON...BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT SHOULD A MORE SUN THAN CLOUDS                
DAY.  BASED ON UPSTREAM TEMPS WHICH WERE IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER             
70S...FOLLOWING THOSE THICKNESSES WOULD TAKE MOST OF THIS SPRINGLIKE            
AIR SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  WITH SURFACE HIGH MOVING ACROSS,               
GRADIENT WILL BE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE MIXING WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MID               
50S AWAY FROM THE WATER.  IT WILL BE A BIT COOLER NEAR THE LAKES AS             
LOCAL CHARTS SHOW LAKE BREEZES SETTING UP EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WITH             
LIGHT 925/950MB WINDS.                                                          
TONIGHT...                                                                      
LAKE BREEZE ACTIVITY WILL ABATE THIS EVENING AS UPSTREAM WAVE BEGINS            
IT APPROACH ON THE GREAT LAKES REGION.  AT THIS POINT, MODELS DO                
DIVERGE WITH RESPECT TO PLACEMENT OF LIFT, MOISTURE AND UPPER LEVEL             
SUPPORT.  GIVEN UPSTREAM SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM, WE WOULD HAVE TO                 
FAVOR THE GFS TIMING.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ              
RUC WHICH BRINGS US TO ADD PRECIP TO THE GRIDS LATE TONIGHT.                    
Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE IS IMPRESSIVE AND COINCIDES WITH OMEGA PATTERN             
LATE TONIGHT FOR SCATTERED POPS IN THE GRIDS.  WITH THE INCREASE IN             
THE CLOUD COVER, TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD UP A BIT INTO THE MID-UPPER             
30S.                                                                            
THURSDAY...                                                                     
WE SHOULD START THE DAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AS Q-VECTOR                      
CONVERGENCE/OMEGA AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT SLIDE TO THE EAST BY LATE                
MORNING.  SURFACE FEATURES WILL BE TOUGH TO PIN DOWN WITH WEAK LOW              
PASSING ACROSS THE LOWER HALF OF THE STATE LEAVING BEHIND SURFACE               
TROF/COLD FRONT ACROSS THE REGION.  HERE IS WHERE SOME MAJOR                    
DIFFERENCES OCCUR AS THE ETA SWINGS A DRY SLOT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN              
COUNTIES WHILE THE GFS IS FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS             
WOULD AGREE WITH THE UKMET AND TAQ RUC TO KEEP THE CLOUDS AND THE               
CHANCE FOR LIGHT SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.  WITH            
THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP, WE WILL NEED TO BRING DOWN OUR             
EXPECTED MAX TEMPS A BIT WITH THE HIGHER VALUES POSSIBLE FROM                   
ARB-DTW SOUTHWARD.                                                              
THURSDAY NIGHT...                                                               
THIS CAN PROVE TO BE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THE FORECAST AND            
WILL LIKELY CHANGE.  LATEST GUIDANCE NOW POINTS TOWARD SHORT WAVE               
TROF TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CWA PUSHING SURFACE COLD FRONT                
SOUTH.  MOISTURE COLUMN IS MORE MOIST THIS RUN WITH GFS OMEGA FIELDS            
FOCUSING ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA.  WITH SOME SURFACE                
CONVERGENCE AND THE CHANCE FOR SOME MID LEVEL WAVE AFFECTING THE                
NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME, WE WILL BRING IN A CHANCE FOR A RAIN/SNOW MIX            
NORTH WHERE THICKNESSES AND SOUNDINGS ARE BORDERLINE...AND A BIT                
WARMER SOUTH FOR PRIMARILY RAIN.  AGAIN, CONFIDENCE IN THIS SOLUTION            
IS POOR AND WILL LIKELY BE MODIFIED.                                            
FRIDAY...                                                                       
WE FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDGE IN                 
PLACE.  WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DRY FORECAST BUT KEEP THE CLOUD               
FESTIVAL GOING.  TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN 45 AND 50            
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.                                                            
LOOKING AHEAD OFFERS TOO MANY CHALLENGES TO MENTION.  HOWEVER, IN               
SUMMARY THE 00Z GUIDANCE TAKES GULF LOW AND TRACKS THIS SYSTEM                  
SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION AND AFFECT THE EAST COAST.  THIS IS                     
SUPPORTED BY THE 00Z CANADIAN WHICH KEEPS THE CWA UNDER HIGHER                  
SURFACE PRESSURES BUT TROFINESS ALOFT.
