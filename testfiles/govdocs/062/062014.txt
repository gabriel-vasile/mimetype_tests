 Week of: May 31 - June 6, 2004          Number: 14 Released: June 7, 2004

                 CROP SUMMARY FOR WEEK ENDING JUNE 6, 2004

It was a wet week for Virginia, as scattered showers drifted across the
Commonwealth. The average accumulative precipitation for the week was just
over 2 inches. However, some areas experienced only a light sprinkle, while
other regions of the State experienced over 3 inches. The average
temperature decreased 5 degrees, to approximately 68 degrees, which was
slightly below normal. Day's suitable for fieldwork were 4.3. Excessive
rain has lowered the hay quality, delayed soybean planting, and raised
concerns about nitrogen depletion. Despite this, good progess has been made
harvesting barley. The barley crop has progressed well with the warmer than
normal temperatures and timely showers. Some farmers reported good barley
yield, ranging from 60 to 100 bushels per acre. Other farming activities
included harvesting hay, tending to tobacco fields, and fixing erosion
problems.
