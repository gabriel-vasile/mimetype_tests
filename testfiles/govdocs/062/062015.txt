                  CROP SUMMARY FOR WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 5, 2004



  The remnants of Hurricane Gaston passed through the State this
  week. Central and eastern Virginia experienced the heaviest rain from this
  storm. However, counties within these regions experienced a wide variety of
  rainfall from flooding conditions with several inches to just barely a
  sprinkle. The western regions of the State received little to no rainfall;
  this combined with hot temperatures has created extremely dry conditions.
  Days suitable for fieldwork were 5.7. The dry areas of the State have made
  good progress with harvesting corn and tobacco, applying chemicals, and
  making hay. Farmers in the flooded regions have suffered; road closures
  have delayed milk pick-ups, hay bales have been washed away or ruined, and
  low lying crops were damaged. Nevertheless, despite the harsh weather
  conditions the State has experienced, the majority of all of Virginia's
  crops, except for apples, are in good or excellent condition. Other farming
  activities included marketing lambs and cattle, attending County Fairs, and
  repairing flood damage.
