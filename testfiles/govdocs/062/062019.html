Today's Recipe: Cranberry Pork Roast
Submitted by: Shelagh S.

I love nothing more than coming home from a long day at the
office to find dinner waiting. Until I can afford a maid, I
have come to depend on my trusty old crockpot. What a great
creation! It's only fitting to have a great recipe to cook
in it, so here's one.

Ingredients:

3 to 4 lb. pork roast*
1 cup ground or finely chopped cranberries
1/4 cup honey
1 tsp. grated orange peel
1/8 tsp. ground cloves
1/8 tspl. ground nutmeg
salt and pepper

*Boneless or pork loin roast may be used

Directions:

Sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper. Place in a
slow-cooking pot (crock pot).

Combine the remaining ingredients; pour over the roast.

Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
