Environmental Fact Sheet: Yard Waste Composting

Across the nation, composting is gaining increased attention as
an environmentally sound way to manage yard wastes. Yard wastes
are such materials as leaves, grass clippings, brush, and tree
prunings. Many communities and 12 states have banned yard wastes
from Iandfills. composting diverts yard wastes from landfills and
combustors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
recommends composting yard wastes. Not only is composting
sensible from an environmental perspective, it also effectively
converts yard wastes into a useful soil additive or mulch.

What Are the Facts About Yard Wastes?

Yard wastes account for nearly a fifth (over 31 million tons) of
all garbage generated in the U.S. each year, making yard wastes
the second largest component [by weight) of the municipal solid
waste stream. The amount of yard waste generated varies
considerably from region to region, during different seasons, and
from one year to the next. In fact, during peak months (primarily
summer and fall), yard wastes can represent as much as 25 to 50
percent of municipal solid waste.

Why Not Put Yard Wastes in Landfills? 

Since these materials are relatively clean and biodegradable,
disposal in landfills may be unnecessary and wastes space. In
addition, as yard wastes decompose in landfills, they generate
methane gas and acidic leachate. Methane is a colorless,
explosive gas that is released as bacteria decompose organic
materials in landfills. If methane is not controlled at a
landfill, it can seep underground and into nearby buildings,
where it has the potential to explode. Yard wastes also
contribute acidity that can make other waste constituents more
mobile and therefore more toxic.

Yard wastes also are generally unsuitable for combustion in
incinerators due to their high moisture content, which can
inhibit complete burning. When burned, yard wastes emit certain
gases which contribute to the formation of smog-causing nitrogen
oxides.


Why Not Burn Leaves And Other Yard Wastes?

Burning leaves and other yard wastes pollutes the air and can
lead to uncontrolled fires. Leaf smoke can make breathing
difficult for people who suffer from asthma, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, or allergies. A number of states currently ban leaf
burning, and some communities either ban leaf burning or restrict
when it can take place.

What Is Composting?

Composting is the controlled decomposition of organic matter by
micro-organisms (mainly bacteria and fungi) into a humus-like
product. Many home gardeners have created compost piles in their
backyards. Towns and cities have set up community-wide composting
facilities that furnish the finished compost to a variety of
users.


How Can Compost Be Used?

Compost can be used for a variety of gardening projects. It can
enrich gardens, improve the soil around trees and shrubs, and be
used as a soil additive for house-plants and planter boxes.
Compost can enhance soil texture, increase the ability of the
soil to absorb air and water, suppress weed growth, decrease
erosion, and reduce the need to apply chemical fertilizers and
peat moss. Following are some other successful uses of compost:

  - Farmers use compost for enhancing crops and for sod farms.

  - Landscapers use compost as a soil amendment and for
    decorative purposes at properties, golf courses, and athletic
    fields. Landscapers also use compost to cover landfills and   
     carry out reclamation projects.

  - Nurseries use compost for enhancing plant and forest seedling 
    crops in reforestation projects.

  - Public agencies use compost for landscaping high way median   
    strips, parks, recreational areas, and other public property.


What Materials Can Be Composted?

Yard wastes such as leaves, grass, prunings, weeds, and remains
of garden plants all make excellent compost. To speed the
composting process, woody yard wastes should be clipped and sawed
down, or run through a shredder. Vacuum cleaner lint, wool and
cotton rags, sawdust, shredded newspaper, and fireplace ashes
also can be composted. Although many foods can be composted, you
should check with your local Board of Health to see if any
sanitary code restrictions apply to food composting in your area.
Do not compost meats dairy foods, fats, oil, or grease.


How Can I Set Up A Compost Pile?

Composting is easy. You can set up a compost pile in a corner of
your yard with few supplies. Choose a level spot about three-feet
square near a water source and preferably out of direct sunlight.
Clear the area of sod and grass. If you build a composting bin,
be sure to leave enough space for air to reach the pile.
Materials such as chicken wire, scrap wood, or cinder blocks can
be used to build the bin. One removable side makes it easier to
tend to the pile. 

Place coarse brush at the bottom of the pile to allow air to
circulate. Then add leaves, grass, weeds, etc. You may layer the
yard wastes with soil, if you want. Keeping the pile moist and
turning it every few weeks will help speed up the natural
decomposition process. In dry weather, sprinkle water on the
pile, but donþt let it get too soggy. Don't be surprised by the
heat of the pile or if you see worms, both of which are just part
of the process. In most climates, the compost is done in three to
six months, or when it becomes a dark crumbly material that is
uniform in texture.


Can Christmas Trees Be Used?

Many communities have begun programs to reuse the more than 30
million trees discarded each year after the holiday season. The
trees are picked up at the curb or collected at dropoff centers
through the second week of January. Then they are ground into
small pieces by chippers, and used as mulch in landscaping. To
prepare your tree for reuse, carefully remove the ornaments,
especially strands of tinsel, and any plastic wrapping or other
materials used to transport the tree. You can also chip the tree
yourself and use the mulch in your own yard.


How Can I Learn More About composting?

EPA has developed several publications related to composting. EPA
recently issued a booklet entitled "The Environmental Consumer's
Handbook that describes how to set up a backyard compost pile.
The Handbook also contains over 75 practical tips for reducing
and recycling solid waste. Another publication, the "Decision-
Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management," devotes an entire
chapter to compost. This Guide is targeted at local government
decision-makers, and contains solutions to many solid waste
management problems. Both of these publications are available at
no cost.

Contact the RCRA Hotline. Call Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m.
to 7:30 p.m. EST. The national toll-free number is (800) 424-
9346. For the hearing impaired, the number is TDD (800) 553-7672.
Copies of these publications can also be obtained by writing:

Agency, Office of Solid Waste (5305W), 401 M Street SW,

Another report for decision-makers, "Yard Waste Composting: A
Study of Eight Programs," is available for a fee from the
National Technical Information Services (NTIS). Call (703) 487-
4650 and ask for publication number PB90-163 114. EPA is also
developing a "Guide to Composting" that will assist policy-makers
in determining what type of composting they should promote in
their community and in planning and operating compost facilities.

In addition, EPA has drafted a report entitled "Markets for
Compost,"  which provides information on markets and uses for
compost.  These two publications should be available in early
1991 from the Hotline.
