       I. INTRODUCTION:
            A. Definition:
               The diagnosis of head lice or pediculosis is made when
               there is an active infestation of the hair and scalp by
               the parasitic insect Pediculosis humanus capitis. The
               condition is contagious as the insect is spread by
               direct head to head contact and less commonly by fomite
               transmission via brushes, hats, and pillowcases, etc.
               The insect feeds on the host’s blood by biting the
               scalp and the common symptom of scalp pruritis is
               caused by an immune response to the insect’s saliva.
               Though of no danger to the host, head lice can cause
               considerable discomfort and present the possibility of
               cutaneous infection secondary to itching. [1]
            B. Incidence and Prevalence:
               Head lice are found in all human populations, with a
               higher prevalence in developing countries. In the
               United States, there is a higher prevalence in children
               than adults, having peak prevalence at 4-11 years,
               though this distribution is less apparent in developing
               countries. There is a higher incidence of infestation
               in long and medium length hair as compared to short
               hair and the male to female incidence ratio is 1:2 [2].
               There is a decreased prevalence in ethnic groups with
               coarse hair, as African Americans. [3] There is no
               causal relationship between hygiene practices,
               socioeconomic status, level of education or nutritional
               status and pediculosis.

      II. PATHOGENESIS:
            A. Natural History of Pediculus humanus var. capitis,
               human head lice:
                 1. Eternal parasites of humans with obligatory
                    blood-feeding habits
                 2. Saliva is vasodilator, may have anticoagulant
                    properties
                 3. Must eat blood meal every 4–6 hours
                 4. Off the scalp, viable for no more than 2 – 3 days
                    [4]
                 5. Lifecycle:
                      a. Stage 1: The egg
                            * Attached to hair shaft by gel secreted
                              by the female louse
                            * Lies 1–3 mm from the scalp
                            * Must have warmth of scalp to hatch
                            * Embryonic egg is small, translucent,
                              hard to see
                            * After 6-10 days, the fertilized eggs
                              hatch
                            * Once hatched, the empty shell, a nit, is
                              easier to see
                            * Eggs are not infectious [5]
                      b. Stage 2 the nymph
                            * Smaller than an adult, hard to see
                            * Not able to reproduce
                            * Molts 3 times, matures in 9-15 days [5]
                            * Not easily transmitted to others
                            * First and second instar nymphs are not
                              transmitted to others [5]
                            * Only third instar nymphs are capable of
                              transmission to others [5]
                      c. Stage 3: The adult
                            * Size of sesame seed, brownish red
                            * Moves quickly but does not hop or fly
                              [1]
                            * Mate as soon as mature, lays eggs 1-2
                              days later
                            * Lives 30 days producing more than 100
                              eggs at up to 6 eggs per day
                            * Takes at least 30 seconds to transmit
                              from head to head [5]
                 6. Spiracles (holes in body serving as breathing
                    apparatus) close when in water; can be dormant for
                    as long as 4 hours in that state
            B. Transmission and infestation in humans:
                 1. Almost exclusively transmitted by prolonged
                    head-to-head contact [5]
                 2. Usually found on scalp but can occur in eyebrows
                 3. Transmission increased in crowded living
                    conditions
                 4. May be transmitted by frequent hugging
                 5. Sharing comb/brushes/hats may or may not transmit
                    lice [1]
                 6. Lice are not responsible for spread of any disease
                 7. There is no evidence that poor personal hygiene
                    causes head lice
                 8. Once infection with head lice occurs, it develops
                    steadily if left unchecked
                 9. Most cases of head lice infection are symptomless
                10. Pruritus from sensitization to parasites saliva
                    usually lead to detection
                11. Pruritus can take up to 3 months to develop [5]
                12. Scratching can cause secondary bacterial
                    infections (impetigo, pyoderma)
                13. Some infected bites lead to lymphadenopathy
                14. Severe louse infections of 12-18 months can cause
                    general systemic reactions of malaise and
                    generally feeling "lousy" [5]

     III. SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT:
            A. History of present illness:
                 1. Confirmed case of active head louse infestation
                    among family members, classmates or anyone else
                    who is in close personal contact
                 2. Recent use of comb/brush or hat that belonged to
                    someone with a confirmed case of head lice
                 3. Recent case of active head louse infestation
                 4. Visualization of a nit found within a 1/4 inch of
                    the scalp visualization of an adult louse or nymph
                    [6]
                 5. Generalized Itching of scalp and nape of neck
                 6. Generalized intense itching of scalp
                 7. Itching at the nape of the neck
                 8. Intense itching at night
                 9. Presence of pruritic papules at nape of neck or
                    around ears
            B. Past Medical History
                 1. Head lice infestation, either treated or untreated
                 2. History of hypersensitivity reaction to any
                    pediculicides treatment
                 3. History of seizure disorder
            C. Medication History
                 1. Current prescription medications
                 2. Over-the-counter medications to include herbal
                    treatments
                 3. History of hypersensitivity reaction to any
                    pediculicides treatment
            D. Family History
                 1. Any active or recent louse infestation within
                    immediate family [7]
            E. Psychosocial History
                 1. Evaluate availability of support systems
                 2. Evaluate for history of compliance with medication
                    regimen
                 3. Evaluate coping mechanisms related to dealing with
                    social stigmas
            F. Dietary History
               Not applicable to this condition

      IV. OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT:
            A. Physical Exam
                 1. Examination of the scalp and hair for:
                      a. Nits (ova) within 0.25 inches of scalp [6]
                      b. Crawling lice (adults or nymphs)
                      c. Examine scalp for excoriation infection
                         secondary to scratching
                 2. Examination of cervical lymph glands; cervical
                    adenopathy is common with secondary infections
                 3. Exam of eyelashes and eyebrows for infestation and
                    prevention of reoccurrence of hair and scalp
                    infestation. Rare but can occur.
            B. Diagnostic Tests
                 1. Identification of eggs, nymphs and lice with naked
                    eye or magnifying glass under bright artificial
                    light or direct sunlight
                 2. Microscopic exam usually unnecessary.

       V. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY:
             * Best choice will depend on local resistance patterns
               [5]
             * FDA approved pediculicides (over the counter):
               Permethrin 1%, Pyrethrins 0.33% synergised with 4%
               piperonyl butoxide
             * FDA approved pediculicides (prescription only): Lindane
               1%, Malathion 0.5%
            A. Pharmacologic options:
                 1. Pyrethroid pediculicides: Permethrin and
                    synergized pyrethrin both kill non-resistant
                    crawling lice, but synergized pyrethrin is
                    significantly more ovicidal than permethrin [5].
                    Treatment failures are common with the pyrethroids
                    due to emergence of resistant strains [8].
                    Resistant infestations have been treated with
                    prescription-strength permethrins (Elimite 5%)
                    normally meant for treating scabies infestations.
                    Higher doses of permethrins generally are not more
                    effective and it is better to consider a different
                    drug. Although permethrin and pyrethrins differ in
                    chemical structure, their mode of action is quite
                    similar. We would anticipate that pyrethrins would
                    also be ineffective in killing
                    permethrin-resistant lice [1]. Permethrin is
                    neurotoxic to lice with low risk to humans due to
                    very low absorption rates, less than 2% absorbed.
                    Consider risk/benefit in pregnancy before using
                    pyrethrin plus piperonyl butoxide, as danger of
                    absorption is higher than in permethrin. Neither
                    preparation should be left on the scalp for longer
                    than the indicated treatment time of 10 minutes.
                    Contraindications to both pyrethroids include
                    sensitivity to drug, allergy to chrysanthemums or
                    ragweed or acutely inflamed or raw scalp. Side
                    effects to skin; pruritis, erythma, burning,
                    stinging, tingling, numbness, edema and rash.
                    Pyrethroids are eliminated in the urine.
                    Contraindicated in children under 2 months of age;
                    Category B in pregnancy and untested in nursing
                    mothers [9,10].

                                   longer, rinse
                                 * A second treatment must be done
                                   7-10 days after the initial
                                   treatment to kill newly hatched
                                   lice
                      b. Applications of Mousse: [10] Pyrethrin 0.33%
                         synergized with 4% piperonyl butoxide (RID)
                            * Apply to dry hair only
                            * Massage until hair and scalp are
                              thoroughly wet with product
                            * Leave on hair for 10 minutes, but no
                              longer
                            * Add sufficient warm water to form a
                              lather and shampoo as usual, rinse
                              thoroughly
                            * Comb with fine toothed comb to remove
                              dead lice, eggs and nits from hair
                            * A second treatment must be done 7-10
                              days after initial treatment to kill any
                              newly hatched lice
                      c. Applications of Cream Rinse: [3,10]
                            * Permethrin 1% Cream Rinse (NIX)
                                 * Shampoo with Prell or other
                                   non-cream rinse containing shampoo,
                                   rinse hair; towel dry
                                 * Saturate hair and scalp especially
                                   behind ears and on nape of neck
                                 * Leave on hair for 10 minutes, but
                                   no longer
                                 * Rinse with water
                                 * Comb with fine toothed comb to
                                   remove dead lice, eggs and nits
                                   from hair
                                 * A single application is usually
                                   sufficient
                                 * If lice are observed 7 days or more
                                   after first application, a second
                                   treatment should be given
                 2. Lindane 1% Shampoo (generic only):
                    Lindane is the least effective pediculicide and is
                    not ovicidal [8] It is neurotoxic to lice and
                    people and is absorbed slowly through skin,
                    especially face, neck, scalp, scrotum, axillae and
                    damaged skin. It collects in body fat, is
                    metabolized by the liver and excreted in feces and
                    urine. It is secreted in human milk [9,10] It has
                    low toxicity in humans with indicated application
                    time of 4 minutes [8], Problems with resistance
                    have lead to increased application times in effort
                    to increase efficacy. This results in increased
                    percutaneous absorption and toxic effects on the
                    central nervous system [8]. Contraindicated in
                    children less than 2 years of age, pregnant and
                    nursing mothers and people with known seizure
                    disorders [10]. Lindane 1% shampoo is banned in
                    California due to environmental problems with
                    lindane in sewage effluent [8].
                      a. Application of Shampoo: [3,10]
                            * Do not prescribe for pregnant women or
                              children < 2 years old
                            * Apply to dry hair: 1 oz for short, 1 1/2
                              oz for medium, 2 oz for long hair
                            * Work thoroughly into hair and allow to
                              remain in place for 4 minutes
                            * Add small amount of water until good
                              lather forms, rinse hair thoroughly
                            * Towel briskly
                            * Comb with a fine toothed comb to remove
                              dead lice and eggs
                            * Repeat application in 7 days to destroy
                              lice hatched from nits not previously
                              removed or affected by treatment
                 3. Combination Therapy with Permethrin and
                    Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, Bactrim):
                    TMP/SMX kills the bacteria within the nymph and
                    adult forms of the head louse, which digests human
                    blood [17] In cases of multiple treatment failures
                    or suspected cases of lice-related resistance to
                    therapy, treatment with 1% permethrin and oral
                    TMP/SMX is recommended [11]. Dual therapy is not
                    the first treatment of choice, it is essential to
                    assess whether initial treatment failure is
                    related to motivational non-compliance,
                    misunderstood directions or resistant lice [11].
                    There are potential side effects from TMP/SMX and
                    children should be monitored for allergic or toxic
                    reactions. Also, treating a louse infestation with
                    TMP/SMX may accelerate the emergence or spread of
                    bacterial resistance, thereby diminishing the
                    usefulness of these antibiotics [1].
                    Contraindicated with sulfa allergy.
                       * Instructions for dual therapy [11] include:
                            * Permethrin 1% cream rinse (NIX) use as
                              above and repeat in 1 week plus
                            * TPM/SMX 10mg/kg/day based on TMP for 10
                              days BID; or
                            * TMP/SMX 1 tablet BID or 1 double
                              strength tablet BID depending on weight
                 4. Malathion 0.5% (Ovide Lotion, prescription only):
                    Malathion has a very slow chemical reaction time.
                    Unlike agricultural grade malathion with "toxic"
                    impurities, the pharmaceutical grade malathion
                    used in Ovide has a high level of purity, is safe
                    and effective [9]. Withdrawn from the US market in
                    1995 because of commercial failure, due to its
                    odor, long application time (8 to 12 hours) and
                    flammability of its alcohol base, it was
                    re-approved by the FDA in April 1999 as a
                    pediculicide for head lice. [8,12] Ovide contains
                    dipentene, terpineol, and 78% isopropanol to
                    increase the pediculicidal and ovacidal activity
                    of the malathion [8] Category B in pregnancy,
                    caution with breast-feeding mothers, not studied
                    in children under 2 years old. Malathion kills
                    both lice and head lice eggs [8]
                       * Instructions for Lotion: [10]
                            * Sprinkle on dry hair; rub gently until
                              scalp is thoroughly moistened. Pay
                              special attention to back of head &
                              neck.
                            * Allow to dry naturally, use no heat,
                              leave uncovered
                            * After 8 – 12 hours wash hair in
                              non-medicated shampoo
                            * Rinse and use a fine toothed comb to
                              remove dead lice & eggs
                            * Repeat application 7 days later if live
                              lice detected. Repeat application rarely
                              needed.

      VI. NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY:
            A. Mechanical Removal
               The use of a mechanical nit comb daily for two weeks is
               often recommended. Shampoo the hair with an olive oil
               or coconut oil based shampoo; scrub then rinse
               thoroughly. Repeat shampooing but do not rinse. Wrap a
               towel around the head for approximately 15-20 minutes
               after which you will begin mechanical removal. Bar soap
               with a coconut or olive oil base, or pure coconut or
               olive oil can also be used [7].
               Separate hair into small sections and comb each strand
               with a fine-tooth comb angled at 45 degrees. The curved
               side of the teeth should be toward the head. There are
               several types of combing tools on the market without
               prescription, including the LiceMeister and the Magi
               Comb. [13] Repeat. Continue this regimen weekly while
               lice are still present in your environment, i.e., at
               home, at school. If reinfestation occurs, combing will
               have to be repeated more frequently [7].
            B. Wet combing (Bug-busting) [13]
               Soak hair with a 50/50 concentration of white vinegar
               and water for approximately 30-60 minutes prior to
               mechanical removal. The acidic environment reportedly
               assists with ungluing the nits [14].
            C. Manual Removal
               Separate hair into small sections and remove the nits
               (eggs) manually by hand. Nits should also be removed by
               hand if they are still present after combing [15].
            D. Coating Agents (Vaseline/ Petroleum jelly, Mayonnaise)
               This method reportedly inhibits louse mobility, causes
               inability for louse to feed and interferes with their
               respiratory efforts causing asphyxiation. A heavy layer
               of the agent is applied to the scalp and covered
               overnight with a shower cap. Vaseline is often avoided
               because of the difficulty washing it out; however, the
               use of Dawn dishwashing liquid as a crème rinse has
               reportedly helped [7]. Caution should be taken when
               using a plastic shower cap on children due to the risk
               of suffocation from the plastic.
            E. Cut hair
               Shaving the head is an approach that, while effective,
               is more readily accepted for male children but is not
               socially acceptable for the female population. Cutting
               the hair may make it easier for mechanical and manual
               removal of nits.

     VII. FOLLOW-UP:
               Follow-up in one to two weeks after treatment is
               recommended to assure adequate treatment [3].

    VIII. REFERRAL:
               Not necessary.

      IX. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE:
               Grading of resources
               The evidence used for this guideline was one
               meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Dodd).
               There are five randomized controlled trials (Bingham,
               Hipolito, Meinking, Mumcuoglu and Roberts). Two
               articles were obtained from well-designed
               non-experimental descriptive studies (De Maeseneer and
               Juranek). All other evidence was obtained from expert
               committee reports or opinions and/or clinical
               experience of respected authorities.
               Categories:
                  * Ia   Evidence obtained from meta-analysis of
                    randomized controlled trials
                  * Ib   Evidence obtained from at least one
                    randomized controlled trial
                  * IIa   Evidence obtained from at least one well
                    designed controlled study Without randomization

                    type of well designed quasi-experimental study
                  * III   Evidence obtained from well-designed
                    non-experimental descriptive studies such as
                    comparative studies, correlation studies, and case
                    control studies.
                  * IV   Evidence obtained from expert committee
                    reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of
