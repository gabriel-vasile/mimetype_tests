Federal marshals were directed to track down and bring           to court any men who were suspected of practicing polygamy. Those sentenced           were handed stiff jail terms, and a number of church members did spend           time in Utah and Arizona prisons.<br>          <br>          <img src="graphics/small_stove.jpg" width="100" height="130" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" alt="Picture of room stove.">           It didn't take the Mormons very long to realize that, if the polygamist           couldn't be found, he couldn't be convicted and sent to prison. Furthermore,           it was difficult to convict a man of polygamy if the plural wife or           wives could not be located.<br>          <br>          </font></p>      </td>      <td width="50%" valign="top" height="249">         <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">A           series of safe houses were established to shelter polygamists or their           wives as they stayed ahead of the federal marshals.<br>          </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Those           using the Pipe Spring safe house were often pregnant women with children           in tow. Another safe house in the system was reportedly in Fredonia,           20 miles to the east. Some say that the name of that town is a mixture           of the word &quot;free&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; in Spanish, and refers           directly to this period of polygamist persecution.<br>          <br>          The bed in the photo above shows another example of the process of faux           graining we discussed in the middle bedroom. Note that the headboard           and footboard of this pine bed have been painted to look like an expensive           birds-eye maple, and the side rails mimic quarter-sawn oak. A time consuming           process for a group of people who already seemed to have plenty to occupy           their time. <br>          </font></p>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td colspan="2" height="46">         <center>          <!--<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Tour             the Grounds at Pipe Spring<br>            Meet some of the animals at Pipe Spring<br>            </b> </font> </p>-->        </center>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="50%" height="47"></td>      <td width="50%" align="right" height="47">         <div align="right"> <a href="wc_middlebedroom.htm" title="Winsor Castle middle bedroom"><img src="graphics/btn-bck2.jpg" width="38" height="40" border="0" alt="Previous room button"></a><a href="winsor_castle_tour.htm" title="Winsor Castle main page"><img src="graphics/btn_hm2.jpg" width="56" height="50" border="0" alt="Floor plan page button"></a><a href="wc_springroom.htm" title="Winsor Castle spring room"><img src="graphics/btn-nxt2.jpg" width="38" height="40" border="0" alt="Next room button."></a></div>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td colspan="2" height="51">         <div align="center">           <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.nps.gov"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NPS             Home</b></font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>             | <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pisp/index.htm">Pipe Spring Home</a>             | <a href="../home.htm">Expanded Home</a> | <a href="../contents.htm">Website             Contents</a> | <a href="trindex.htm">Virtual Tours</a> | <a href="../visit/visitpisp.htm"><br>            Visit Info</a> | <a href="../kids/notjustkids.htm">Educational Resources</a>             | <b><a href="http://www.nps.gov/pisp/pphtml/nature.html">Natural             Resources</a> | <a href="../mngmnt/pkmngmnt.htm">Park Management</a></b></b></font>             <!--|&nbsp;Natural Resources | Cultural Resources |&nbsp; Park Management-->            </font></b></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Updated:             <!-- #BeginDate format:Am1 -->June 7, 2004<!-- #EndDate -->            </i></font></p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div>		<center>			<h5></h5>		</center>	</body></html>
