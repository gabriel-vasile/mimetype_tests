    <p align="center"><br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">(House of Representatives -July 12, 1996)</h3>
    <div align="center"><center><pre>[Page: H7482]      <font size="+1"></pre>
    </center></div><p>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I
    may consume. </p>
    <p>Mr. Chairman, first a word on this amendment. What this amendment aims at is the
    anti-States'rights portion of this bill. This bill has been grossly misadvertised in
    several ways. One, it saysthat it is a defense of marriage, and I will return to that. But
    it is a defense against a nonattack. </p>
    <p>Nothing in what Hawaii is about to say, namely probably sometime late next year or
    early in1998 allowing same-sex marriages, nothing in that by any rational explanation
    would impinge onmarriages between men and women. Nothing whatsoever. </p>
    <p>The factors that erode marriages, the factors that lead to divorce, the factors that
    lead toabandonment and spousal abuse, none of them have ever been attributed to, in any
    significantdegree, same-sex marriage. </p>
    <p>But there is another misadvertisement. Proponents of the bill say it is necessary to
    keep otherStates from having to do what Hawaii does. Now we should make clear that none of
    themthink that is true. None of them believe that, absent this bill, any other State would
    becompelled to do what Hawaii does. I stress that again. Every single sponsor of this bill
    believesas I do that the States already have the right that this bill gives them. </p>
    <p>Mr. Chairman, this is a bill which conveys on the press the right to write articles.
    This is a billwhich conveys on individuals the right to go to synagogues on Saturday,
    church on Sunday,mosques on Friday. This is a bill to do what the people in charge of the
    bill think is alreadythere. That is why we understand it to be purely political. That is
    why a Supreme Courtdecision in Hawaii from 1993 which will not be made final probably
    until 1998 comes up in1996. It is a declaration that the States have the rights that they
    already have coming a fewmonths before the Presidential election. </p>
    <p>But there is another place of it. They say this is a States' rights bill and it is to
    prevent anotherState from having to do what Hawaii does. It has a second and only
    operative section, and thatsection says if Hawaii or any other State decides to allow
    same-sex marriage by whatevermeans, whether they do it by court decision or by popular
    referendum or whether they do it bylegislation, the Federal Government will say to the
    State: Wrong, you cannot do that as far as </p>
    <p>we are concerned. We, the Federal Government, will disallow that. While you can make
    adecision for your State's processes to allow same-sex marriage, we, the Federal
    Government,will substantially overrule that because we will say that is not a marriage as
    far as Federal law isconcerned. </p>
    <p>As people understand, given today's rule, Federal law has a lot to do with their lives,
    so as faras Federal income tax is concerned and Social Security and pensions and other
    things, they willnot be covered. </p>
    <p>Now, let me talk a little bit personally. We have had some personal talks. I would
    feeluncomfortable if I thought I was up here advocating something that I thought would be
    directlybenefitting me. </p>
    <p>I should say that Herb Moses, the man I live with, already has my pension rights. He
    hasexactly the same pension rights I have. Zero. I do not pay into the pension. I am not a
    memberof the congressional pension system, so Herb already has those pension rights. </p>
    <p>That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about people less well favored in
    society than Iand other Members. I am talking about working people, people who are working
    together,pooling their incomes as many Americans do that today in difficult situations and
    economiccircumstances, trying to get back, and feeling a strong emotional bond to each
    other, decidingthey would like to pool their resources in a binding legal way. Hawaii
    says: We allow you to dothat. This bill says: We overrule Hawaii. This bill says there
    will be no States' rights here. </p>
    <p>Mr. Chairman, what the other side of the aisle believes on the whole is the right of
    the States tofollow what they think is correct. There is nothing new about this. When it
    comes to tort reform,they will tell the States what to do. When it comes to a whole range
    of areas, they will tell theStates what to do. </p>
    <p>I do not think there is any principle I have ever seen more frequently enunciated and
    lessfrequently followed than States' rights from the Republicans. What they mean is that
    the Stateswill do whatever they tell them to do. </p>
    <p>Mr. Chairman, I do not claim to be a States' rights advocate. I think there are times,
    given anational economy, when a national uniform solution is the only sensible one, but
    this is not oneof them. I want to be particularly clear now. People talk about </p>
    <p>their marriages being threatened. I find it implausible that two men deciding to
    committhemselves to each other threatens the marriage of people a couple of blocks away. I
    find itbizarre, even by the standards that my Republican colleagues are using for this
    politicalargument here, to tell me that two women falling in love in Hawaii, as far away
    as you can getand still be within the United States, threatens the marriage of people in
    other States. </p>
    <p>That is what this bill says: Do not worry, you people in Massachusetts and Nebraska
    andWyoming and Texas and California. The Federal Government is running to the rescue. You
    sayyour marriage is in trouble? You say there are problems with divorce? </p>
    <p>It would seem to be clear that divorce does more to dissolve marriages than gay
    marriages. It isextraordinary to have people talking about how marriage is in peril. When
    the gentlewomanfrom Colorado [Mrs. Schroeder] wanted to offer amendments dealing with
    divorce, she wasruled out of order. </p>
    <p>The gentleman from Oklahoma said the Bible speaks ill of homosexuality, and it does.
    Thereare also strong passages in the Bible that say if couples get a divorce and remarry,
    they haveviolated the rules. There are religions that do not allow people who have been
    divorced toremarry. There are religions that make divorce very, very difficult: Roman
    Catholics, OrthodoxJews, and others. </p>
    <p>I believe that those religions have every right to say if couples get divorced, if they
    take this oathand say it is a lifetime solemn oath and then they dissolve, for whatever
    reason, they findsomeone else more attractive, they get tired of each other, we will make
    it difficult for them todissolve those bonds as we put them on and we will not allow them
    to remarry. </p>
    <p>That is a right we should fight for every religion to have, but there are clearly
    Members in thisChamber, supporters of this bill, who do not think that biblical injunction
    should be civil law.There are people who believe that that biblical injunction that says
    if couples divorce, they shallnot remarry, should be disregarded by those who wish to
    disregard it; that the religion shouldnot have the right to enforce them, but individuals
    should have the right under civil law to makealternate choices. That is all we are talking
    about here. </p>
    <p>People say, well, we do not want to have State sanctions. Let me talk about that. I am
    verypuzzled by the antilimited Government notion that brings out. </p>
    <p align="center">[Page H7483]</p>
    <p align="center">[TIME: 1130] </p>
    <p>I have not had people come to me and say, I am in love with another woman, I want to
    getmarried because I really want to have State sanction. I want to know that the gentleman
    fromFlorida, the gentleman from Georgia, that they really like me. No one has come forward
    andsaid, can you please arrange so that the Republican Party and the House of
    Representatives willexpress their approval of my lifestyle. That is not a request I have
    ever gotten nor expect to get.</p>
    <p>What people have said is, can I regularize this relationship so we are legally
    responsible foreach other. Can I get to the point where if one of us gets very ill we will
    be protected in ourability to undertake financial responsibilities? Can we buy property
    jointly? Can we do the otherthings that people do? Can we decide that one will work and
    one might be in child rearing,there are people who have children in t hese relationships.
    That is what they are asking for. </p>
    <p>What kind of an almost totalitarian notion is it to say that whatever the Government
    permits, itsanctions and approves? That is what is clear. Yes, there is a role for
    morality in Government.Of course there is. The Government has an absolute overriding duty
    to enforce morality ininterpersonal relations. We have a moral duty to protect innocent
    people from those who wouldimpose on them. That is a very important moral duty. </p>
    <p>But is it the Government's duty to say, divorce is wrong and there are strong biblical
    argumentsthat say if you are divorced, you should not remarry. And should the Government
    then putobstacles in the way? No. What we say in this society is, religion has its place.
    If you want areligious ceremony, if you want to be married as Roman Catholic, if you want
    to be married byorthodox Jewish rabbis, if you want to be married by other groups, you
    better abide by theirrules. But if you as an individual say, I do not love that person
    anymore, I am walking out, I amtired, I want a new husband, I want a new wife and,
    therefore, I dissolve it, no fault divorce,leave me out, and I want to remarry, civil law
    allows you to do that. </p>
    <p>Does civil law say that is a good thing? Does civil law, by allowing you to divorce and
    remarry,say, good, we approve of that, we sanction your walking out on that marriage and
    starting anew one? No, what civil law says is, in a free society that is a choice you can
    make. We willrequire, I hope, that you pay up any obligation you have to the children who
    were the productof the first marriage. We do not do that well enough. </p>
    <p>But beyond that we leave that choice. And that is all we are talking about. No one is
    asking forsanctioning. In particular, what we are saying is, if the State of Hawaii and,
    by the way, if youwere going to pick a State less likely to infect others, I am still
    trying to understand, I said, whatis it about two men living together that threatens
    marriage? The people who denigrate marriageare the people who argue that marital bonds are
    so fragile between man and woman thatknowing that two men can marry each other will
    somehow erode them. How could that be? </p>
    <p>We heard one argument about it yesterday. He said, well, it might lead to polygamy. I
    am astudent of legislative debate. Let me make one very clear point. When people get off
    thesubject, allowing Hawaii to have gay marriages without penalizing them federally, and
    on tosomething wholly unrelated, polygamy, and attack the unrelated one, it is because
    they cannotthink of any arguments to attack the first one. </p>
    <p>Yes, it is true polygamy as an option for heterosexuals would weaken the current option
    ofmonogamous heterosexual marriage. That is why I do not know anyone who is
    advocatingpolygamy. Why are they then debating polygamy? Because they are cannot argue
    over here. </p>
    <p>There is a story about a guy who is on his hands and knees under the streetlight, and
    he iswalking around, looking around. Somebody stops to help him, says, what is the matter.
    Hesaid, I lost my watch. He said, I will help you. After 5 minutes, he said, gee, I do not
    think yourwatch is here. He said, I know, I did not lose it over here. </p>
    <p>He said, why are we looking here under the streetlight. He said, well, the light is
    better. Theywant to debate polygamy because the argument is better. But there are no
    arguments aboutsame-sex marriage. </p>
    <p>I have asked Member after Member who is an advocate of this bill, how does the fact
    that twomen live together in a loving relationship and commit themselves in Hawaii
    threaten yourmarriage in Florida or Georgia or wherever? And the answer is always, well,
    it does notthreaten my marriage, it threatens the institution of marriage. That, of
    course, baffles me some. Institutions do not marry. They may merge, but they do not marry.
    People marry,human beings. Men and women who love each other marry. And no one who
    understandshuman nature thinks that allowing two other people who love each other
    interferes. </p>
    <p>Is there some emanation that is given off that ruins it for you? Gee, Hawaii is pretty
    far away.Will not the ocean stop it? Are those waves that undercut your marriages? People
    who aredivorced, I had one of my colleagues say to me, I have been divorced a couple of
    times. I wasfeeling guilty about it, but now I know it was your fault, he told me. He
    said, the Republicanshave explained it to me. That is why I have been married three times.
    You did it to me. </p>
    <p>He said, the next time I have an argument with my wife, I am going to blame you. And I
    guessthat is what we do because it has got to be some mysterious emanation. And apparently
    it issuch a powerful emanation that it crosses oceans. </p>
    <p>Hawaii, let me ask my friend, how many miles, 3,000? How many miles is Hawaii from
    here? Itis 5,000 from here, 5,000 miles away. My friend, the gentleman from Hawaii, my
    friend, thegentlewoman from Hawaii, what power they have. They allow same sex marriage in
    Hawaii and5,000 miles away, marital bonds will crumble. That seems pretty silly, but that
    is what the billsays. </p>
    <p>All I am saying here is, and by the way, I agree each State ought to be able to decide
    for itself.That is not what this amendment is about. I believe the States already have
    that right. I am noteven touching in this amendment the part of the bill that does it. </p>
    <p>This amendment says, if the State of Hawaii by any reason whatsoever decides to allow
    gaymarriage, we, the Federal Government, will treat marriages that Hawaii validates the
    same aswe treat others. The answer is, that will be sanctioning gay marriage, as if the
    FederalGovernment sanctions, what, many divorces and remarriages. We have no-fault
    divorces.People walk out for no good reason. That is an unfortunate trend. We ought to try
    and changeit. But scapegoating gay men and lesbians for the failure of marriages in this
    society is very goodpolitics but very terrible social analysis. That is what we are
    talking about. </p>
    <p>I am simply saying here, I do not know of another State that is even close to Hawaii in
    doingthis. Hawaii will probably do it in about a year. No other State is doing it. Are you
    thatdesperate for a political issue that you reach out this far? We have in the law
    something calledlong-arm statutes. This is a real long-arm statute. This reaches from the
    politics of Washington,DC, 5,000 miles out to Hawaii, and says, how dare you let two women
    express the love theyfeel for each other in a legally binding way because that is all we
    are talking about. We aretalking about nothing that undercuts heterosexual marriage. We
    are talking about nothing thatpromotes divorce, nothing that would encourage spousal
    abuse, nothing that would encourageneglect of children. None of that. </p>
    <p>We are talking about an entirely unrelated subject. The arguments are, therefore, so
    weak that,as I said, we get into polygamy and other unrelated issues. </p>
    <p>If Members are really telling me they do not understand the difference between a
    polygamousheterosexual relationship and a monogamous homosexual relationship, then they
    are confessinga degree of confusion that I guess I would be embarrassed to confess. </p>
    <p>All this amendment says is, and let us be clear on this amendment, no argument
    aboutprotecting one State from another State is relevant. To the extent that this bill has
    any role inprotecting one State from another State, this amendment leaves it detached. </p>
    <p>What this says is simply, if Hawaii does it, we will recognize what Hawaii does. And we
    will notfalsely claim that multiple divorces and remarriages, spousal abuse, child
    neglect, all of thoseproblems, and economic stress and others things that cause stress in
    marriages, nobody willargue that letting two women love each other in Hawaii in any way,
    shape, or form threatensthat. That is the vote I will be asking Members to take. </p>
