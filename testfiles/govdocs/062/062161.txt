<desc2> Description:
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, passenger 
vehicles?


<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain information on the 
crashworthiness of a given vehicle or vehicles that 
can be used to draw a comparison with other vehicles.  
The document will have to describe/compare vehicles, 
not drivers.  For instance, it should be expected 
that vehicles preferred by 16-25 year-olds would be 
involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of
crashes per 100,000 miles, for example.

<desc2> Description:
Evidence that radio waves from radio towers or car phones affect brain 
cancer occurrence.


<narr> Narrative: 
Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using
car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument 
rages regarding the direct association of one with the other.
The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by
some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A 
relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical 
study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain 
cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a 
radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the 
general population.

in the world today.

<desc2> Description:
I chose any mention that shed any information on the existence of 
polygamy Find evidence of polygamy, historic or current,in today's 
world.


<narr> Narrative: 
Polygamy is a form of marriage which permits a
person to have more than one husband or wife.
Polyandry refers to one woman sharing two or 
more husbands at the same time.  Polygyny refers
to one man sharing two or more wives at the 
same time.  Primary focus of the search will be
the prevalence of these practices in the world
today and societal attitudes towards these
practices.  Also relevant would be discussions
of the roots and practical sources of these
customs.  A modern development in this area is
serial polygamy, a phrase coined to label the
practice of men who take a series of wives in
sequence as a solution to practical welfare,
considerations of child care, housing, etc.
Documents discussing serial polygamy will not
be considered relevant.
