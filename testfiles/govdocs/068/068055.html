<BR>
<B>Class Definition:</B><BR><DIV>
This class accommodates certain products of manufacture which
are not provided for in classes devoted primarily to
manufacturing methods and apparatus. The bulk of the
documents are directed to stock material composites, that is,
materials having two or more distinct components which are
more ordered than a mere random mixture of ingredients.
<BR>
Certain finished articles, generally of an ornamental or
readily disposable nature, are placed herein when this class
specifically provides for them.  Unfinished articles, e.g.,
blanks requiring further significant shaping to be suitable
for ultimate use, and stock materials from which an
indefinite number of usable portions may be cut, are placed
herein unless specifically provided for elsewhere. The
determination whether a product is a finished article or a
stock material is made on the basis of the amount of
structure included in the body of the claims.
<BR>
A patent for this class is placed herein generally without
regard to the process by which it is made, for example,
without regard to whether the plural layer product was formed
by extrusion, coating, or assembly of preformed layers.
<BR>
Therefore, unless otherwise clearly stated, the term
"coating" or "layer" will include a preform as well as a
layer formed by covering a base with a fluent material which
<BR>
then solidifies. A comprehensive search for processes of
making the products of this class will be found in the
manufacturing classes listed below.
<BR>
An asterisk has been applied to certain terms throughout this
bulletin to indicate that these terms have specific
definitions in the Glossary, which should be consulted.
<BR>
The asterisk has been applied to identify the term in the
first appearing definition which must be considered for the
desired subclass title.
<BR>
It should be noted that there are two sections for the
glossary.  The first one applies generally to the structural
areas of the schedule; the second applies to materials (e.g.,
compound, composition, etc.).  It should further be noted,
however, that the structural areas of the class also include
some subclasses directed to materials.
<BR>
Both sections of the glossary should be consulted.
<BR>
This is the residual class for:
<BR>
A. Stock material in the form of a structurally defined web*,
sheet*, rod*, strand*, fiber*, filament*, cell*, flake*,
particle* not provided elsewhere.
<BR>
B.   Stock material in the form of a web*, sheet*, mass* or
layer* which consists of or contains a structurally defined
constituent* or element* not provided elsewhere.
<BR>
C.   A nonstructural laminate defined merely in terms of the
composition of one or more layers* not provided elsewhere.
<BR>
D.   An article* of manufacture not provided for elsewhere.
<BR>
E.   An intermediate-article* which is not provided for
elsewhere and from which a final article is to be made.
<BR>
F.   A process for applying an impregnating material to a
naturally solid product such as a wood beam, a sheet of
leather or a stone, or for applying a coating to a base, and
which process includes no significant method step.  Such a
patent is placed in the schedule on the disclosed product
produced, whether structural or nonstructural.  See section
VI, C, 6, below, reference to Class 427, Coating Processes,
for guide lines which are to be followed in determining
whether or not a process step is significant, for
classification in Class 427, or not significant for placement
in Class 428.
<BR>
FRAMEWORK OF THE CLASS
<BR>
This class comprises several major subclass groups which can
be identified by reading down the first-line indent
subclasses, and a special category for metallic* materials
which parallels the arrangement provided for nonmetallic*
<BR>
materials, insofar as this arrangement is applicable.  These
major groups and parallel metallic* groups are:
<BR>
A. Subclasses 1 through 39 and 576 provide for special
articles* generally defined in all three dimensions, for
which there is no provision elsewhere, and subclasses 542 and
577+ provide for intermediate-articles*.
<BR>
B. Subclasses 40 through 84, 571 through 575 and 586 through
591 provide for a special web* or sheet*.
<BR>
C. Subclasses 85+ for special surface characteristics of the
pile or nap type.
<BR>
D. Subclasses 98+, 357+, 544-570, 592-604, 606-614, and 687
provide for stock material either in the form of a web* or
sheet*, or an element* (e.g., rod*, fiber*, filament*,
particle*, flake*, etc.), respectively, which of and by
itself is structurally defined as claimed.
<BR>
Some examples of a structurally defined web* or sheet* are:
(1) particular shape, particular size, or other physical
configuration. (2) including an external mechanical fastener
so as to be attached to another object. (3) components* or
elements* arranged relative to each other or to a surface.
(4) components* having same characteristic but in different
degree. (5) a discontinuous coating, impregnation or bond.
(6) variation in thickness or in planarity. (7) attachment of
components* by stitching and bond or coating. (8) apertures.
(9) surface finish. (10) any recitation of a measurable
extent, no matter how wide, (e.g., "up to .075 mil", "between
10 and 25 microns", etc.).
<BR>
Some examples of structurally defined elements* are:
<BR>
(1) particular size or shape or other physical configuration
(see above). (2)  nonlinearity of a fiber or filament (e.g.,
crimped or coiled, etc.). (3) specific depth of impregnation
of a fiber or filament.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  As a special case, even though not structure, a
coated or bonded fiber, filament, rod, strand is placed in
subclasses 357+.
<BR>
E. Subclasses 221+ provides for a web* or sheet* in which one
component* or element* (e.g., fiber, filament, strand,
particle, etc.) is structurally defined as claimed.
<BR>
Some examples of defined structure are: (1) size or
particular configuration or shape, either absolute or
relative (e.g., weight* per unit area). (2)  interengagement
of strands* or filaments* which means mechanically arranging
one strand* or filament* alternately over and under other
strands*, perpendicularly or angularly related thereto.  If
all strands* in one direction are on only one side of the
strands in the other direction, this is not interengagement.
Looping, intertwining, interweaving, intertangling are also
<BR>
included in the term interengaged.
<BR>
(3) a composite* web* or sheet*, at least one component*
being porous or cellular. (4) a composite*, web* or sheet*
having the outermost layer of adhesive characteristics so as
to be adhered to another surface.
<BR>
F Subclasses 411+ and 615+ provide for a composite* web* or
sheet* which is characterized solely by the composition of
the layers*.
<BR>
G. Subclasses 539.5 and 540+ provide for stock-material*
having a continuous phase of one material interengaged with a
continuous phase of a different material, usually made by
permeation or saturation.  See the definitions and notes of
these subclasses.
<BR>
In addition there are provided in subclasses 900-941
cross-reference art collections of product patents based on
use or particular characteristics indicated in the titles and
definitions thereof.  These collections of disclosures are
not exhaustive but are intended as aids to a search based on
ultimate function or use, as a supplement to a search in this
class, or as an indication of further related fields of
search inside or outside this class.
<BR>
SCOPE OF CLASS
<BR>
The scope of this class is defined by the residual state
thereof as set forth in above.
<BR>
It must be clearly understood that all patents to stock
material products have not been removed from all those
classes which provide for such products on the basis of their
ultimate function, See below for an exemplary listing of such
classes.
<BR>
As to composites (subclasses 411+ and 615+), the disclosures
of this collection of art (i.e., adhered bodies defined in
terms of their respective compositions or compounds) are
subdivided generally on the basis of pairs of contiguous
bodies (conveniently referred to as "layer"*).  Thus, for
instance, a laminate composed of layers* A, B, C, in that
order, is visualized as comprising the pairs A-B and B-C, the
laminated, A, B, C, D as comprising pairs A-B, B-C, and C-D--
and so on.  This arrangement is conceived of as facilitating
the search for any multi- layered product, particularly for
patent examination purposes.  Whereas a search for substance
A joined to substance C by an intervening layer* of B, in a
system based on paired layers*, may produce a disclosure of
A-B in one document and of B-C in another, or may retrieve a
disclosure of A-B-C in one document, it is thought that all
such disclosures should be available to the examiner for his
consideration, whether in a single document or a combination
of documents.  The utility of such as approach is apparent in
the search for products including five, six, seven, or more
layer* pairs or interfaces.
<BR>
Additionally, it is believed that this concept of laminates
as consisting of pairs of layers* may be incorporated readily
into a machine retrieval system.  Having in mind the ubiquity
of layer* interfaces in modern technology--appearing in both
laminated and molded plastics, protective and decorative
finishes, wood and paper products, metal stock--the technique
of subdividing into layer* pairs all disclosures in the
voluminous literature of interfacial bonding, is seen to
offer an effectual starting point for the development of a
schedule of descriptors or a dictionary of terms for
mechanical search.
<BR>
It is an essential part of the considerations on which this
paired-layer* schedule is based, that no weight is given to
the alleged nature of any particular layer* as adherent or
base.  The disclosure of two particular layers* in mutual
contact will be available for the searcher's consideration
regardless of whether either, both, or neither is taught as
being adhesive, bonding material, glue, impregnant, etc.
<BR>
CRITERIA FOR PATENT PLACEMENT WITHIN THIS CLASS
<BR>
The general procedure for placement of a patent in a class is
set forth on in the Manual of Classification (note the
exception set forth in the last paragraph of this section).
Briefly, the basic principles which determine placement of
the original copy of a patent in this class are:
<BR>
A. Only claimed subject matter is relied upon, when comparing
coordinate "first-line indent" subclasses (e.g., subclasses
98 and 221), for placement of a patent.
<BR>
B. In subclass 1 through 223, 292.1 - 301.4, and 304.4 -
410,
<BR>
1. the original copy of said patent will be placed in the
first-occurring "first-line indent" subclass (of this class)
which provides for the claimed subject matter:  However,
where said "first-line indent" subclass has a further
indented subclass which specifically provides for either the
claimed or disclosed more specific subject matter, the
"original" copy will be placed in said further indented
subclass;
<BR>
2. as between coordinate subclasses (e.g., subclasses 156 and
174) which are indented under a "first-line indent" subclass,
the original copy of a patent will be placed in the
first-occurring of the coordinate subclasses which provides
for (a) the claimed subject matter, or (b) the disclosed
subject matter (in the absence of a claim drawn to the more
specific subject matter as provided for in such coordinate
subclasses);
<BR>
3. further, the original copy of a patent will be placed in
an indented subclass where the unclaimed but disclosed more
specific subject matter is provided for in said indented
<BR>
subclass.
<BR>
C. In the subclasses relating to specified physical dimension
(e.g., 215+, 220, 332+, etc.), a range thereof qualifies even
though the work "absolute" may be used.
<BR>
Further, in a subclass which specifies the upper limit of a
dimension, for example, subclass 334, in which the upper
limit is specified as 5 mils (or equivalent), a range which
transcends this limit is excluded therefrom and is placed in
the appropriate higher subclass.  Thus, for example, a
composite* sheet* in which the coated layer* is recited as
being in the range of 3 mils to 7 mils, is excluded from
subclass 334 and is placed in subclass 332, unless reason
exists for placement in subclass 339.
<BR>
D. In subclasses 544+, the original is placed strictly on the
basis of the claims.  Where an indented subclass is provided,
the original is placed in the indented subclass only when all
of the claims have the limitations of that indented
subclass.
<BR>
E. The procedure for placement of a patent directed to a
nonstructural laminate or composite will be that procedure
now employed in the classification of classes of chemistry
and is set forth under the definitions of subclasses 411 and
615 of this class (428). Procedures applicable to patent
placement in the experimental "Markush"-type subclasses 643,
656, 661, 664, 669, 671, and 678 are given in the definition
of subclass 643.
<BR>
Once placement of the original copy of a patent has been
determined, a cross-reference copy of the patent is mandatory
in every subclass in this class or any other which provides
for other claimed subject matter, except in instances where
the subclass which would normally receive such
cross-reference copy contains a search class note to the
subclass in which the original copy has been placed, in which
case only exemplary cross-references are provided.
Cross-reference copies may be placed in any subclass where
the disclosed subject matter is considered to render the
document as useful reference.
<BR>
When the original of the patent is placed in the article* or
structural subclasses, a cross-reference copy will be placed
in subclass 411, or subclasses 615+, where the disclosed
subject matter is considered to render the document as useful
reference. Similarly, when the original copy of a patent is
placed in subclasses 323+, a cross-reference thereof will be
placed in a superior subclass where the disclosure warrants.
<BR>
CLASSES HAVING A DEFINED RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS CLASS
<BR>
Completed articles* of manufacture, except for those
expressly provided for in the schedule, are excluded from
this class. However, in many cases the claims of a patent are
directed only to "nominal" articles, that is, articles
<BR>
claimed only in terms of the composition or stock-material*
from which they are made.  It is the present policy of the
Patent and Trademark Office to classify article patents,
wherein the claims mention the article by name only and
define it only in terms of the composition or material of
which it is composed, in the appropriate composition or
material class.  The collection of these patents and
reclassification thereof into the composition or material
classes is under way, and as a corollary thereto, patents
claiming a composition or material for an art use heretofore
classified in the art classes are also being transferred to
the appropriate composition or material class.  For articles*
provided for in other classes, attention is directed to the
"Index to Classification", and to LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES,
below.
<BR>

<BR>
In section II, the symbol # is used at the end of the
definition to designate a class or part of a class which
provides for certain stock-material*.  Here follows the
number and full title of classes which have been discovered
as having a defined relationship with this class, as
explained below in Subsection INTERMEDIATE-ARTICLES*, and in
the subclass definitions:
<BR>
A. INTERMEDIATE-ARTICLES*
<BR>
1. Packages, Class 206, provides, in general, for mercantile
units in which a plurality of articles* are held together by
an extraneous element which is discarded before the article
is used.  A plurality of articles which are not yet detached
from each other, being held together by material intrinsic to
the material of which the articles are made, generally is
classified in this class (428); however, Class 59, subclass
77 provides for a series of staple blanks which are partially
shaped and integrally connected.  Class 229, subclass 75
provides for a plurality of envelope blanks integrally
connected in strip form.  A package designed to be used or
disposed of in toto is generally classified herein; see
subclasses 2 and 576.  See also the references to Class 252
in part B, below.
<BR>
Stock material in roll or coil form, or wound in the form of
a coil, will be classified in Class 428; however, any further
limitations as to the roll, or coil or package, as for
example, an overlapping roll edge, an edge or convolution
taped or secured to an under layer*, or a detail as to the
mandrel, etc., is considered to be significant structure for
the roll and placement in Class 206, subclasses 389+ is
indicated.
<BR>
A separate and distinct interliner or sheet* wound into the
convolutions and which is not ordinarily part of the stock
material is considered to be significant roll structure for
Class 206.  A liner sheet adhered to a portion of a
composite* sheet* or web* and rolled together therewith and
removable is considered to be part of the stock material and
proper for Class 428.
<BR>
Generally, a product or stock material falling within the
definition of this class (428) and further modified by the
bare recital that such product or material (a) is in the form
of a roll, reel, drum, coil, stack, pile, bale, etc., or (b)
is within a container or in the form of a package is
classified in this class (428).
<BR>
For purposes of classification in Class 428, the coil,
packaged or wound form is disregarded and placement is on the
basis of the web*, sheet*, or other form of product or stock
material.
<BR>
See Class 206, subclasses 45.31+ for a pouch adapted to
receive an identification card (unless of the paper envelope
type, see Class 229, Paper Receptacles).
<BR>
In regard to wall structure of Class 206-type receptacles,
see part C,3, a, below.
<BR>
A wound strand package is in Class 242, subclasses 159+,
which also has a search note setting out its line with Class
206.
<BR>
An intermediate-article* so shaped as to be suitable for
handling is in this class (428); however, a claim to a pile
or stack of such articles, when it does not form a
work-piece* which is subsequently worked as a unit, is in
Class 214, subclass 10.5.
<BR>
2. Blanks, etc.
<BR>
A claim, even though stated to be a "blank" which describes
or is readable on the structure of a completed article* is
classified with the article*, for such a claim is either
generic to both the blank and the article, and, therefore,
considered to be best classified with the completed article,
or is to a subcombination which is best classifiable within
an appropriate subcombination class, or, if none, in the
article class.
<BR>
Class 2, subclass 143 provides for blanks which are to be
used in making collars for garments.
<BR>
Class 10, subclasses 11+ provide for bolt blanks, and
subclass 62 provides for spike blanks.
<BR>
Class 24, subclasses 20+ provide for a package tie which is a
metal band which is to be bent, cut, or formed up to make a
connection.
<BR>
Class 36, subclasses 47+ provide for blanks used in the
production of shoe uppers.
<BR>
Class 59, subclasses 8, 12 and 35 provide for chain blanks,
subclass 62 provides for horseshoe blanks, and subclass 77
provides for staple blanks which are partially shaped and
integrally connected.
<BR>
Class 63, subclasses 15+ provide for a finger-ring blank
which already is a ring.
<BR>
Class 76, subclasses 101.1+ provide for a metal tool or
implement blank.
<BR>
Class 101, subclasses 404.1+ provide for blanks for printing
plates and printing members.
<BR>
Class 138 provides for tube and ring blanks which are tubes
which can hold fluid.
<BR>
Class 150, subclasses 127+ provides for blanks used in making
pocketbooks.
<BR>
Class 220, subclasses 62+ provides for a can or other
metallic receptacle blank.
<BR>
Class 229, Envelopes, Wrappers, and Paperboard Boxes,
subclasses 100+ for a blank for forming a paperboard box.
<BR>
Class 248, subclass 248 provides for a blank from which a
sheet-material supporting bracket can be made.
<BR>
B. Compounds and Compositions
<BR>
A patent claiming a single layer*, film, filament*, or
fiber*, or a mass*, with a limitation to the material(s) of
which it is comprised, but with no recitation of significant
structure, will be placed in the appropriate compound or
composition class.  The following are considered to be
significant structure:
<BR>
1. An external configuration which is not planar or
cylindrical, e.g., aperture, fold, varying thickness, etc.
<BR>
2. The recitation of a numerical dimension or designation of
metal as a foil or leaf
<BR>
3. A product composed of at least three layers*.
<BR>
4. A coated strand, wire, fiber, filament, rod or strand.
<BR>
5. An interconnected void structure.
<BR>
6. Porosity in a nonparticulate metal.
<BR>
The following are not considered to be significant
structure:
<BR>
1. Random distribution of elements* such as fillers or
reinforcements (e.g., fibers*) within a product or randomly
disposed pores or cells (i.e., no particular pattern or
arrangement) in a porous, cellular or foamed product, wherein
the overall structure is neither limited nor influenced by
these elements*, even though the elements* or pores
themselves may have structural limitations.
<BR>
2. Internal characteristics, such as crystalline form,
molecular orientations, etc., when such characteristics have
no relation to the shape of the product.
<BR>
3. The presence of the composition as a coating on an unnamed
substrate.
<BR>
A product described by a functional or chemical name only
(e.g., table, wood, etc.) is not considered to have
significant structure; however, limitations such as plywood
<BR>
(indicating layers*), tables with legs, etc., are considered
to define structural limitations.
<BR>
Also, a patent for a product where the presence of structure
(e.g., cellular) or the degree thereof is a mere
manifestation of the material or composition will likewise be
placed in the appropriate material or composition class.
Further, a product defined in terms of its properties (e.g.,
tensile strength, elongation) is not considered a
"structurally defined" product, as provided for in this
class.
<BR>
In regard to a patent which has a claim to a product which is
classifiable in this class (428), subclasses 411+, but which
recites no significant structural limitations, and a claim to
a coating material compound or composition which is included
in at least a part of the claimed product, and claim to a
significant process of coating, the patent is classified
according to the coating material.
<BR>
The rules for determining Class placement of the Original
Reference (OR) for claimed chemical compositions are set
forth in the Class Definition of Class 252 in the section
LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES AND WITHIN THIS CLASS, subsection
COMPOSITION CLASS SUPERIORITY, which includes a hierarchical
ORDER OF SUPERIORITY FOR COMPOSITION CLASSES.
<BR>
The enumeration of classes below, in general, follows the
priority list of Class 252 and covers some additional
classes.  Thus, this enumeration is not authoritative insofar
as priority of classes is concerned.  The definitions of
these classes should be studied to determine the proper
placement of patents therein.
<BR>
Class 504, subclasses 116+ provide for plant growth
regulating compositions and subclasses 101+ provide for a
fertilizer containing an insecticide, fungicide, or
deodorant.
<BR>
Class 424 provides for drug, bio-affecting and body-treating
compositions.  Subclasses 1.21, 1.25, 1.29+, and 400+ provide
for some articles* and stock-materials* which contain a
composition of that class.  A stock-material* suitable for
this class (428), containing a Class 424 composition to
preserve the stock material itself from biological attack, is
in this class (428).  Residual methods for preserving,
disinfecting or sterilizing stock-materials are in Class
422.
<BR>
Class 426 provides for food, beverages and other edible
compositions, and certain edible articles* and
stock-materials*.
<BR>
Class 71, provides for fertilizers.
<BR>
Class 208, subclasses 14+ provide for compositions made up
exclusively of mineral oil components.
<BR>
Class 585, subclasses 1+ provides for compositions made up
exclusively of hydrocarbons or a hydrocarbon with a
preservative, etc.
<BR>
Class 149 provides for explosive and thermic compositions and
charges, subclasses 2+ providing for one in which at least
one ingredient has a particular shape or structure, and
subclasses 14+ for one having at least two separate and
distinct superimposed or contiguous layers or forms of
different components or of components having different
properties.  The layers must be in direct contact and not be
separated by a space or by a nonexplosive or nonthermic
body.
<BR>
Class 508, subclasses 100+ provide for shaped lubricants and
massive rigid solid bodies, including bearings, which carry a
fluent lubricant, and subclasses 110+ provide for lubricant
compositions generally.
<BR>
Class 44 provides for fuel compositions and some combustible
fuel articles* and stock-materials*.
<BR>
Class 148, subclasses 240+ and 22+ provide for certain
compositions for treating solid metal, and subclass 400.1 for
certain stock-materials* and compositions produced by a
process of that class (148).  See the references to this
class in parts 4 and 6, below.
<BR>
Class 75, subclasses 228+ provide for consolidated metal
powder compositions, in subclasses 251+ for loose metal
powder compositions, and in subclasses 95, 256 and 257 for
certain additives for molten metal.
<BR>
This class (428), subclass 576 provides for a shaped article*
to be melted in a metallurgical furnace.
<BR>
Class 252, in subclasses other than those listed above or
below, provides for special utility compositions.  In most
cases, Class 252 provides for compositions having a random
mixture of components, while stock-materials* are classified
in this or another stock-material class.  However, it is
noted that some subclasses in Class 252 provide for more than
mere compositions; for example, subclass 176 provides for
packages and heterogeneous arrangements of water-softening
and related-function compositions.
<BR>
Class 510 provides for cleaning compositions and auxiliary or
perfecting compositions therefor, while certain subclasses
therein, such as subclasses 404, 438+, etc., provide for
packages or heterogeneous arrangements, while subclasses
445+, etc., provide for solid, shaped macroscopic articles or
structures.
<BR>
Class 106 provides for a composition which is in fluent or
solid noncoherent form which is adapted for coating or
impregnating and for change to a less fluent form, or solid
<BR>
coherent form, by setting (e.g., concrete, plastic, etc.), by
chemical reaction, by removal of solvent, by solidification
from a molten state, etc.  In a patent directed to a filler
or pigment for a coating composition, the recitation of size
or structure of the constituent* particles or fibers is not
sufficient to exclude said patent from Class 106. See
especially subclasses 36, 117, 235, 241, 251, 253+, 266, 272,
275, 276, 280, 281+, 288+, 636, 784, and 816.
<BR>
Class 51 provides for abrading composition or some stock
material; see especially subclasses 294, 295, and 297 for
other abrasive stock material, or for a method of making
abrasive material such as "sandpaper."
<BR>
Class 451 provides for abrading materials in usable form, as
a "tool" under that class definition.  For example,
subclasses 526+ provide for "sandpaper."
<BR>
Class 260, subclasses 2+ and 520 Classes provide for a
synthetic resin or Natural Rubbers (spinnable, film-forming,
etc.), and Class 260, subclasses 709+ provide for a
vulcanizable natural gum (e.g., rubber).
<BR>
Under certain circumstances, the relation between Class 260,
520 Classes and Class 428 shifts between combination and
subcombination.  For example, the subcombination of a resin
composition is in Class 260 and 520 Classes; a layered
product structurally defined and containing the resin
composition as a layer is now a combination which is
classified in Class 428.  However, the combination of the
layered product and a resin, when the layered product is used
as filler for the resin is again classified in Class 260 and
520 Classes as a resin composition.
<BR>
Class 252, subclasses 299.01+, 625+, 363.5, 367.1, 372+, 378,
182.11+, and 183.11+ provide for compositions on a
nonfunctional basis.
<BR>
Class 423 provides for inorganic compounds, and in subclasses
265+ provides for compositions having an inorganic compound
and an agent which improves the general utility of the
compound.
<BR>
Class 430, Radiation Imagery Chemistry: Process, Composition,
or Product Thereof, appropriate subclasses for stock material
and products which are radiation sensitive and limited to use
in imagery and a finished imaged article chemically defined.
A claim to a finished picture or photograph is classified in
Class 428.
<BR>
Class 520 provides for synthetic resins, natural rubbers,
compositions and modifications thereof.
<BR>
C. Articles* and Stock-materials*
<BR>
1.  Life-sciences related materials.
<BR>
Classes 3, 47, 433, and 449 take articles*, but not
stock-materials*.  A cut, natural plant, treated to prolong
the characteristics of life, is in class 47, and that class
(47) provides for the combination of a receptacle and a cut
plant either treated or with means to prolong the
characteristics of life.
<BR>
Class 128 is the locus for a patent directed to a
stock-material* product when (1) solely disclosed to be worn
by, or   attached to, the body (e.g., sanitary napkin,
diaper, etc.) and to be a receptor for a body discharge (2)
solely disclosed as a shield or protective device to be worn
on, or attached to, a body member or part (e.g., bandage,
dressing, etc.) and having a therapeutic use or (3) a patent
to a stock-material* product whose disclosure includes a
Class 128 utility as set out above or in the class definition
thereof, and a general utility for Class 428, but in which
one claim is specific to the Class 128 disclosed use.
<BR>
2. Textiles and related materials
<BR>
Certain textile manufacturing classes provide for their own
products, and Classes 2, 5 and 245 provide for products only,
while some other textile products are provided for in this
class.
<BR>
a.  Fibers, strands, rods, etc..
<BR>
Class 19, subclasses 144+ provide for a process of, or means
for, assembling fibers* together into a lap, sliver or web*,
with some other material. Stock-material* products of a Class
19 process are classified in this class (428).
<BR>
Class 52, subclasses 720.1+ provide for a miscellaneous
article* which is an elongated, rigid structure.  See also
the reference to Class 52 in part 3d, below.
<BR>
Class 57, subclasses 200+ provide for a stock-material*
strand* consisting of, or comprising, a claimed twisted or
twined constituent*; or for a stock-material* product (e.g.,
web*, sheet*, etc.) distinguished only by such twisted or
twined strands* (as claimed) employed in the manufacture
thereof, or a stock-material* product comprising coated or
impregnated strands* in which the coating or impregnation
took place prior to assembly of said strands* to form the
product, no matter how the twist was made, whether by a Class
57 process or apparatus or otherwise.
<BR>
The "twist" or its equivalent term is applicable either to
plural fibers* or filaments* which are twisted about each
other, or to a monofilament which is turned or twisted about
its longitudinal axis.  A crimped fiber is classifiable in
Class 428, the crimp being out of the plane of the fiber.
<BR>
This class (428) does not exclude a yarn, strand*, or other
constituent* unless the claim recites at least a "twist" or
its equivalent; or a property due to, or resulting from,
<BR>
twisting a fiber* or filament*.  There are certain terms
which have been accepted as denoting a twisting fiber* or
filament*, and, if used in a claim, classification in Class
57 is indicated, provided all other requirements therefor are
met.  Some of these terms are:
<BR>
i. plying, doubling, twining, twisting (all such terms are
considered to be synonymous) and indicate turning about the
longitudinal axes of the fiber* filament or yarn or bundles
of yarns;
<BR>
ii. filament looped upon itself;
<BR>
iii. turns of twist per inch;
<BR>
iv. false twist;
<BR>
v. twist to treat, followed by untwisting;
<BR>
vi. spun staple fiber yarn e.g., wool, cotton, etc.;
<BR>
vii. "Z" or "S" twists or piles;
<BR>
viii. roving.
<BR>
In the event of a disclosure which includes (1) "twisted"
strands, fibers, filaments for Class 57, and (2) nontwisted
elements proper for Class 428, the following guidelines are
to be followed in accordance with the claims:
<BR>
1. A claim generic to both modifications will be classified
in Class 428 as an original with a cross-reference, if
needed, to Class 57.
<BR>
2. A claim specific to either the twisted or nontwisted
fibers will be classified in Class 428 or Class 57,
respectively, with a proper cross-reference to the other
class as needed.
<BR>
3. A claim to the twisted Class 57 modification and a claim
to the nontwisted product will be classified as an original
in Class 428 with the proper cross-referencing.
<BR>
Class 84, subclasses 199 and 297+ provide for strings for
musical instruments.
<BR>
Class 256, subclasses 6+ provide for barbed-strand fence
stock-material*, and in subclass 46 for analogous nonbarbed
stock-material*.
<BR>
Class 464, Rotary Shafts, Gudgeons, Housings, and Flexible
Couplings for Rotary Shafts, subclasses 51+ provides for
flexible shafting; and subclasses 179+ provides for rigid
shafting.
<BR>
b. Interengaged fibers or strands
<BR>
Class 59, subclasses 78+ provide for a chain formed of linked
elements.
<BR>
Class 66, subclasses 69+ provide for a knitted article or
stock-material*, and especially subclasses 190+ for
stock-material* including knitted material with nonknitted
material held in its loops.
<BR>
Class 87, subclasses 1 through 13, provide for (1)
stock-material* which consists of, or includes, a braid, net,
or lace component, or (2) a product resulting from an
operation(s) within the scope of that class (87), which
product is either coated or combined with a material which is
the product of an operation beyond the scope of Class 87
(e.g., lamination, etc.).
<BR>
Class 131, subclasses 321+ provide for stock-material*
specified as being a filter and of indeterminate shape (e.g.,
mass), or approximating the shape (e.g., coil, tube,
cylinder, rod*, etc.), of the article or appliance with which
it is intended to be used, requiring no further treatment
than tearing or cutting to proper size* stock-material* of
any other shape, recited so that some shape modification is
required, is classified in Class 428.
<BR>
Class 139, subclasses 383+ provide for a single or plural
layer* woven stock-material* product made only by a Class 139
process and no other operation.  A patent directed to a woven
product possessing deformed, coated or impregnated strands
will be placed in Class 139 where the sole disclosure is that
a coating, impregnation or deformation of the constituent
strands took place prior to the weaving.
<BR>
Two layers woven together are classified in Class 139.  Two
woven layers adhered together are classified in Class 428,
one layer of woven material next to a layer of nonwoven
material is classified in Class 428.
<BR>
Class 162 provides for a nonstructural (1) single-layer*
waterlaid fibrous product, (2) plural-layer* product
including a layer* of fibers* applied to a second layer* by a
process provided for in that class (162), or (3) paper
homogeneously impregnated throughout, even after the web* is
formed, and note particularly subclasses 141-181.1+, which
include any nonstructural fiber* (or fiber-containing)
product (e.g., particular blend of fibers*), whether
waterlaid or not.  Also, see notes in Class 162, referring to
Class 428, e.g., Class 162, subclasses 141 and 150 for
examples of structural fibers.  This class (428), subclass
596, provides for metallic wire cloth formed by welding
plural all-metal wires at their points of intersection; in
subclass 605 for a mass of metal fibers, including plural
layers of wire cloths joined by mechanical compression and
sinter bonded into a fibrous mass, and in subclass 608 for a
mass which includes metal wires, strands or strand portions
mechanically intertangled, interwoven or interlooped, coated
with a metal or a layer of metal or nonmetal fibers located
<BR>
between two metal layers.
<BR>
Class 245 provides for a wire fabric* which is the product of
a bending or analogous wire-working operation.
<BR>
Class 256, subclass 5 provides for barbed-fence fabric*, and
in subclass 45 for analogous nonbarbed material.

(e.g., strand, rope) forming a tie or fastening and including
any bend or hitch.
<BR>
c. Belts, etc.
<BR>
Class 198, appropriate subclasses provide for an endless
conveyor belt or a stock material* disclosed solely for use
as a conveyor belt.
<BR>
Class 474, appropriate subclasses provide for an endless
power transmission belt or a stock material* disclosed solely
for use as a power-transmission belt.
<BR>
Class 162, subclasses 348+ provide for a flexible endless
band-type paper-making mold of the Fourdrinier variety.
<BR>
Class 400, subclasses 237+ provides for an inked typewriter
ribbon.
<BR>
d. Associated fabrics
<BR>
Class 2 provides for a stock-material* product of that class,
and especially subclasses 244 and 274, respectively, for an
apparel trimming or binding, and 260 for coated stays or
stiffeners.
<BR>
Class 5, subclass 500 provides for a stock-material* product
solely disclosed for use as an underpad or cover pad for a
mattress, and which protects the mattress by receiving
discharges of the body, for example, infants or hospital
patients.  Those cover pads are usually made of absorbent
material.
<BR>
Class 112, subclasses 400+ provides for sewn stock-material*,
except for sewn stock-material* which includes a discrete
mechanical fastener(s), a coating, or an adhesive bond, for
which see subclasses 102+ of this class (428).
<BR>
e. Textiles and manufacture thereof in general
<BR>
Class 8 provides for a process of (1) dyeing or bleaching
stock-material*; (2) treating hides, skins, feathers, or
animal tissue with chemicals or fluids; (3) improving the
felting properties of fibers*; (4) treating textile* fabrics*
or fibers with fluids, with or without chemical modification
of the treated material; or (5) a product resulting from any
of the processes above, where not specifically provided for
<BR>
elsewhere.  Structured stock is classified in Class 428,
Stock Material or Miscellaneous Articles, or other
appropriate class.
<BR>
Class 26 provides for mechanical, nonliquid treatment of
textile* fabrics* (e.g., napping), subsequent to fabrication,
which is not provided for elsewhere. Stock-material* products
of a Class 26 process are provided for in this class (428).
<BR>
Class 28, subclasses 72+ provide for a mechanical textile*
process not elsewhere provided for, a combination of such a
process with another textile* operation or with a nontextile*
operation provided for in some other textile* class with a
nontextile* operation where such combination is not
specifically provided for in the other textile* class.
Stock-material* products of a Class 28 process are provided
for in this class (428).
<BR>
Class 140 provides for processes of wire-working, e.g.,
uniting, shaping or deforming, but generally not for the
products thereof.  For the line between Class 140 and the
other textile classes, see the main class definition of Class
140.
<BR>
3. Static objects and materials.
<BR>
a. Receptacles, chambers, etc. Articles* in the form of
receptacles or chambers are provided for in a number of
classes and portions of classes, the most important of which
are listed below.  Those which also provide for sheet* or
web* material, claimed in terms of significant wall
structure, are indicated by the symbol "#".  Significant wall
structure includes seam structure (not merely the composition
of the seam and adjacent portions), spaced wall components,
etc.  Also significant for placement in the classes marked
"#" is specified wall structure in relation to the container
(e.g., inside or outside). Thus, a coated or laminated wall
in which the composition of a layer is recited as being on
the inside (or outside) of a container is considered to be
significant wall structure and placement in classes marked
"#" is indicated.
<BR>
See reference to Class 138 in this section for examples of
wall structure which would also be considered to be
significant for placement in such classes, and for example
which would not be so considered.
<BR>
Class 123 provides for certain chambers in an internal
combustion engine.
<BR>
Class 126, subclasses 19+ provide for ovens.
<BR>
Class 164, subclasses 349+ provide for sand molds, and
subclass 374 for a flask section to be used in a
metal-casting operation.
<BR>
Class 206 provides for a special receptacle.
<BR>
Class 215 provides for bottles and jars.
<BR>
Class 217 provides for wooden receptacles.
<BR>
Class 220 provides for receptacles in general, and for
metallic receptacles in particular.  See subclasses 23.9,
62.21, 574.3, 495.01+, and 908.1+ for a receptacle having a
liner.
<BR>
Class 229 provides for paper receptacles.  See especially
subclass 71 for a paper-like display envelope for receiving
an identification card, and other appropriate subclasses for
receptacle structure as provided for therein; a coated wall
structure, where the coating is specifically defined to be
either on the inside or outside of the bag or receptacle will
be considered receptacle structure and will indicate
placement in Class 229.  This coating may be for the purpose
of acting as a vapor barrier, waterproofing layer, or
antislide means, etc., and is especially related to the
contents of the bag or receptacle.
<BR>
Class 249 provides for articles* which are static molds.
<BR>
Class 266, subclass 39 provides for articles* which are
receptacles for treating molten metal.

shield or gun mount.
<BR>
Class 138 provides for an article* which is a tube and for
tubular stock-material* in which the claims include a
limitation regarding wall structure.  A claim which recites a
particular composition as being the inside or outside wall of
a tube is considered to be significant wall structure and
placement in Class 138 is indicated. However, a claim which
recites a tube or conduit having two or more layers* and then
recites the compositions of the layers*, but does not specify
which layer is inside or outside, is not considered to
include significant wall structure and will be placed in
Class 428.  Examples of significantly recited coated wall
structure for classification are:
<BR>
1. A tube having a wall comprising a layer of metal and on
the outer (or inner) surface thereof a layer of polypropy
lens.
<BR>
2. A tube having a laminated wall of three layers, in order
from the inside to the outside, comprising polyethylene,
epoxy, and polypropylene.
<BR>
Examples of coated or laminated wall structure which are not
<BR>
significantly claimed and which indicate classification in
Class 428.

changing the shape or size of an optically reflecting or
transmitting medium, surface or interface, or (2) changing
the composition, internal structure, or the physical or
chemical properties of such a medium, surface or interface,
and in subclasses 838+ for a mirror having claimed optically
significant structure, e.g., concave, convex, polarizing,
selectively absorbing, optically critical thickness, etc. A
plural layer product, one layer of which merely acts as a
support or base for a coating which affects the transmission
of light therethrough, which one layer is uniformly opaque or
transparent or translucent, is excluded from Class 359, and
<BR>
will be found in the appropriate subclasses of Class 428, see
especially subclass 426.
<BR>
Class 369 provides for a record of information which is to be
reconstructed dynamically by other than magnetic means. See,
in particular, subclasses 272+.  A disc with/without grooves
which does not include recorded information is classified in
Class 428, subclasses 64.1; and see especially subclass 908
for a collection of stock materials having an impression
retention layer.  Class 430 provides for a finished

sheet* generally employed as a portion of a building
structure and including (1) a stiffener or edging extending
along a face thereof, or (2) means facilitating securement of
the web or sheet to a support, e.g., a flange at the edge of
a panel for receiving a nail, or fastener apertures at the
edge of a panel.  Class 52 also provides for:  a composite
panel formed of separate sheets which are secured together by
a mechanical fastener; a composite panel having spaced facing
sheets with inturned, opposed flanges that form an edge of
the panel; and a panel which interfits with a support such as

4. Electric and magnetic elements. The classes listed below,
with the exception of those marked with the symbol "#", do
not provide for electric or magnetic stock-materials*.  The
marked classes or portions of classes provide for
stock-material* only when such material has a claimed
internal or external structure which makes the material of
utility only in a single class.  In general, an electrode is
either an article* for the classes listed, a stock-material*
for this class (428), or a composition for a composition
<BR>
class, notably Class 75, or Class 252, subclasses 500+.
<BR>
Class 136, subclasses 236+ provide for thermocouple junction
stock-material*.
<BR>
Class 148, subclasses 33+ provide for P-N junction
stock-material* made by a process of that class.
<BR>
Class 174 provides for stock-material* in the form of an
electrical conductor with a covering of dielectric material
wherein the conductor includes structure disclosed to be
specially designed to conduct electricity, or the dielectric
includes structure disclosed to be specifically designed to
space the conductor from ground or from a device of otherwise
different potential.
<BR>
Class 191, subclass 22 provides for conductive articles*
specifically designed to transmit electricity to vehicles.
<BR>

Class 219, subclasses 145+ and 552+ provide for articles*
which are electric heating elements.
<BR>
Class 257, Active Solid-State Devices (e.g., Transistors,
Solid-State Diodes), provides for electronic devices or
components that are made up primarily of semiconductor
materials which operate by the movement of charge carriers -
electrons or holes - which undergo energy level changes
within the material and can modify an electrical input to
achieve rectification, amplification or switching action.  A
mere named combination of doped semiconductor materials where
the sole use of the device is disclosed as an active solid
state device results in classification in Class 257.
Recitation of electrical contacts or leads is not necessary
to classification in Class 257.
<BR>
Class 310, subclasses 248+ provide for articles* which are
electric generator or motor brushes.
<BR>
Class 313, appropriate subclasses, especially subclass 326,
provide for electrode structure for electric lamps and other
discharge devices which are defined by their structure for in
such devices.  A mere recitation of a wire, rod, strip,
cylinder, etc., is not considered to be structure for Class
313, nor is a recitation only of the electrode composition or
of a base and/or coating. Nonmetallic* rods, strands, fibers,
etc., which are structurally defined, but do not include
structure for use as electrodes for lamps, are found in Class
428, subclasses 357+; note especially subclasses 375+ for
coated rods, strands, fibers, etc.  A plurality of
electrodes, unless specifically related structurally to each
<BR>
other or to other structure, for use in a lamp or discharge
device will be found in Class 428, appropriate subclasses.
<BR>
Class 317 provides for articles* of use in electrical
applications not provided for elsewhere.
<BR>
Class 318 provides for articles* used in electric-motive
power systems.
<BR>
Class 335, subclasses 296+ provide for a magnet or magnetic
material (including structure, e.g., lamination of work at
least two magnetic layers disclosed for use as a source of
magnetic flux for performing external work).
<BR>
Class 336, subclasses 233+ provide for a core or magnetic
body comprising superimposed bundles or layers of magnetic
material in the form of sheets, rods, or wires, and for
single sheets, punchings, rods, or wire which have such
configuration that they have no utility except in building up
of a core or coil for use in an inductor device within the
class definition (e.g., transformer, etc.).
<BR>
Class 337, subclass 379 provides for an article* which is a
bimetallic element of a thermally actuated switch.  This
class (428), subclasses 616+ provide for bimetal thermostat
stock-materials*.
<BR>
Class 338 provides for electrical resistor stock-material*
which is claimed in terms of its resistance characteristics.
<BR>
Class 340 provides for articles* used in electrical
communications.
<BR>
Class 360 provides, especially in subclass 131 for a product,
which may be layered or otherwise structured, which is
particularly or uniquely designed or arranged to store or
record information by a change or variation in the magnetic
state of the device.  The line between Classes 360 and 428 is
as follows:
<BR>
Class 379 provides for article* used in telephony.
<BR>
1. A product recited as magnetic tape or storage will not
suffice to place a patent in Class 360 in the absence of
recitation of structure of the overall product or internal
structure of the material, or function, unique to magnetic
memory or recording.
<BR>
2. Layered products of general utility or otherwise not
provided for utility are classified in Class 428.  A patent
disclosing both a Class 360 and a Class 428 function, and in
which the claims are generic to both disclosures on which has
a claim specific to the Class 428 disclosure will be placed
in Class 428 as an original.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  The following examples are set out to serve as
guidelines in determining placement of patents:
<BR>
(a)  improved adhesion of magnetic layer to base, greater
tensile strength of the layer (s) abrasion lubricated
surface, improved flexibility, etc., are not considered to be
be structure or properties peculiar to information recording
or structure;
<BR>
(b)  structure which is directed to improved signal-to-noise
ratio, signal stability, nondestructive readout (N.D.R.O.),
nonprint through of signal, signal identity, hysteresis loop,
orientation or packing density of magnetic signal is
significant for Class 360, and patents claiming such
structure or function will be so classified.
<BR>
Class 429, subclasses 40+ provide for a catalytic fuel cell
electrode structure, subclasses 129+ and 247+ for a battery
separator or retainer, subclasses 209+ for a battery
electrode and subclasses 233+ for a battery grid.
<BR>
Class 439 provides for articles* which are electrical
connectors. See the introduction to part 5 a, below.
<BR>
5. Mechanical elements
<BR>
a. Joints.  Those classes or portions of classes which
provide for joints and connections, viz, Class 160, subclass
42, Classes 277, 285, 403, and 439 take a connection or seal
between two or more members at substantially a single locus
where the structure or shape (e.g., ring, flange, angular
relationship, etc.) of at least one of the members is
specifically recited.  For a mere joint or connection between
two members defined merely by the compositions of the
members, see this class, appropriate subclasses, particularly
subclasses 630+ and 426+ where glass is one of the members.
<BR>
Class 15 provides, in appropriate subclasses, especially
subclasses 208+ for stock-material* product disclosed solely
for use as a wiper, dauber or polisher for brushing,
scrubbing and general cleaning.
<BR>
Class 29, subclasses 76.1+ provide for an article* which is a
file or rasp, and subclasses 95+ provide for an article*
which is a cutter.
<BR>
Class 30 and Class 83 provide for articles* which are cutting
implements appropriate to each class.
<BR>
Class 51 is referred to in part B, above.
<BR>
Class 55 and 210 provide for filters, especially subclasses
522+ of the former and 500+ of the latter for such filter
product manufactured of or including a specific material
(e.g., fiber*, coating, etc.), or possessing specific
structure (e.g., weave, knit, etc.).  Class 55 takes its own
stock-material* when it specifies that a gas separation takes
place or is about to take place.  In Class 210 there must be
claimed structure, internal or external, restricting the
<BR>
stock-material* to filter use. A filter generic to Classes 55
and 210 is placed in Class 210.
<BR>
Class 131 is discussed in part C, 2, b, above.
<BR>
Class 241, subclass 95 provides for a stationary comminuting
surface having openings.
<BR>
c. Friction elements
<BR>
Class 188, subclasses 250+, and Class 192, subclasses 107+
provide for a product with a frictional property, where said
property is enhanced by claimed structure (external, such as
disc surface configuration, or internal, such as discrete
zones of friction material, particular arrangements of
strands, fibers or layers), where the sole use disclosure is
as a brake for Class 188, or as a clutch or brake for Class
192.  Where the use of the product goes beyond these classes,
or there is no claim to brake or clutch/brake features,
placement in Class 428 is indicated.  See also the reference
to Class 52 in part C, 3, d, above.
<BR>
d. Other machine elements
<BR>
Class 101 provides for a product which is disclosed as a
printing plate and has significant structure for printing
(see subclass 395), or a nonuniform (e.g.,
hydrophylic-hydrophobic) coating only for printing purposes
(see subclasses 453+), or a hectos:graphic surface (see
subclass 473).
<BR>
Class 152, subclasses 151+ provides for a resilient tire,
subclasses 548+ for such tire formed of a particular
material(s), and subclass 367 for a tire patch.
<BR>
Class 346, subclasses 134+ provide for a single or plural
layer web or sheet which is disclosed as a record receiver
solely for use with apparatus provided for in (1) and (2) of
the definition of that class.
<BR>
(1) Note.  A web or sheet disclosed as a record receiver of
general utility, or for multiple uses, at least one of which
is other than for a recorder apparatus provided for in Class
346, is classified in the appropriate subclass in Class 428,
with a cross-reference to Class 346, if appropriate.
<BR>
(2) Note.  A web or sheet which has chart graduations thereon
will be assigned to Class 346, subclass 135.1, regardless of
its disclosure.
<BR>
Class 411 provides for expanded, threaded, headed, or driven
fasteners.
<BR>
Class 416, subclasses 223+ provides for an article* which is
an impeller or turbine blade.
<BR>
Class 492, Roll or Roller, provide for rolls and rollers
<BR>
which claim enough of the surface and support structure to
rotatably mount the roller. Hollow cylindrical rollers follow
the line specified with regard to Class 138 in part C, 3, b,
above.
<BR>
6. Coating and coated products.
<BR>
Class 148, Metal Treatment, subclasses 206-238 provide for
processes of carburizing, nitriding, or both (e.g.,
carbonitriding, etc.) of solid metal, and subclasses 316-319
for the resulting stock.
<BR>
Class 204, Chemistry:  Electrical and Wave Energy, provides
for the manufacture of stock-material* products by chemical
processes involving electrical or wave energy, and except for
products classifiable in this class (428), subclasses 544+,
for a stock-material* product disclosed solely as made by a
process which, per se, would be classified in Class 204.  A
multiple disclosure that the product can be manufactured by
either a Class 204 process or another process (e.g., spray
coating, electroless-depositing, etc.) indicates original
classification in another class (e.g., 428, etc.), with a
cross-reference, as needed, to Class 204.
<BR>
Class 420 provides for alloys and compositions having a
ontinuous phase of metal.
<BR>
Class 427 provides for the method of applying a coating or
impregnation to a substrate.
<BR>
In relation above, the following guidelines are to be
followed in determining whether a process step is significant
for determining the classification of a patent containing
only process claims in either Class 427 or Class 428:
<BR>
(a) Any pretreatment or post treatment of a base or applied
coating is significant, e.g., curing, drying or smoothing of
the coating, or cleaning, drying or heating of the base, etc.
 General statements such as applying, impregnating, coating,
covering, etc., or allowing to cure, allowing to dry, etc.,
are not considered to be significant method steps.
<BR>
(b) Any specific recitation of the manner in which the
coating material is applied, e.g., brushing, dipping,
padding, spraying, immersing, is significant.
<BR>
(c) Any limitations regarding the thickness of a coating or
nonuniformity of a coating resulting from a process is
considered to be significant.
<BR>
(d) Specific recitations as to the condition of the coating
material being applied are significant, except for the
following: (1) Any condition also included in an independent
composition or material claim, such as p4 concentration,
etc.; (2) A general reference to the state of the coating
material as molten, in solution, in an organic or inorganic
solvent, etc., unless accompanied by specific limiting
<BR>
conditions such as time or temperature (even though recited
as ordinary temperature or room temperature, etc.). However,
specifically recited solvents such as benzene, carbon
tetrachloride, sulfuric acid, etc., are considered to be
significant.
<BR>
Any patent having only process claims in which at least one
significant limitation is recited, examples of which are
given above, is placed in Class 427.  All process claims
having no significant limitation recited will be placed in
Class 428.
<BR>
Special Note in relation to Class 427:
<BR>
As a general rule, specific subclasses in Class 427 are not
pointed out as pertinent fields of search. Class 427 should
be considered, in all instances, for the disclosure of a
product made by the process in the appropriately titled
subclass.
<BR>
7. Assembling and/or shaping.  In general, the products of
the following classes which provide for assembling and/or
shaping methods are not classified in these classes, but in
this class (428), or other appropriate product class: Classes
29, 65, 72, 76, 79, 82, 125, 156, 164, 219, 228, 264, and
413.
<BR>
8. Other manufacturing or treating.
<BR>
Class 261, subclasses 94+ and 100+ provide for apparatus
under the class definition, including a porous mass* or
porous sheet*, respectively, for providing intimate contact
between a gas and a liquid.

condition of the devices or structures, and subclasses 205+
provide for articles* combined with additional structure to
form an arrangement which provides an indication produced
from motion resulting from changes in the thermal condition
of the articles*.
<BR>
Class 376 provides for an article* which is a nuclear element
and for stock-material* of such element having a unique
adaptation for such use.  For example, a jacketed material
having passages for the escape of fission products is a
unique adaptation, but a merely sheathed material is not.
<BR>
Class 446, Amusement Devices:  Toys, subclasses 217+ for
spinning type toys which are similar in construction to
special occasion ornaments for Class 428, subclasses 7+.
<BR>
Classs 473, Amusement Devices: Games, subclasses 316+ for an
article* which is a golf club shaft.

ART TERM INDEX TO THE CLASS
<BR>
The following Search This Class, Subclass references are
provided for convenience in locating the principal subclasses
containing patents related to certain terms generally
employed in the art.
<BR>
D. CLATHRATES AND INTERCALATES
<BR>
Clathrates and intercalates (inclusion compounds), per se,
are classified hierarchically and subject to the limitations
set forth in the compound (element) classes based both on the
encapsulant and encapsulate. For example, a clathrate of urea
and hydrogen peroxide is classified in Class 564, subclass
32, urea and an organic compound in Class 564, subclass 1.5,
dextran and iodine in Class 536, subclass 112, etc. Where a
patent does not state that a material is either a clathrate
or an intercalate, the assumption is made that the material
is either a coated or encapsulated product classified in
Class 428, subclasses 402+.

<BR><B>GLOSSARY:</B>
<BR>
A. Structural
<BR>
Glossary terms below are characterized as either A.
Structural or B. Nonstructural or Composition. The terms are
identified as such.
<BR>
Terms or phrases used in titles and definitions either
repeatedly or in a special and limited sense are set forth
below with the meaning each is to have in this class.  For
economy of space, an asterisk (*) following a word indicates
that reference should be had to this glossary for the
specific meaning thereof while an asterisk following an
hyphenated phrase, (e.g., strand-portion*, etc.) indicates
that the entire hyphenated term, as such, has been defined in
this glossary.
<BR>
Note.  Where appropriate throughout the definition, the
alternatively singular or plural forms of a noun have been
indicated by the addition of (s) immediately following the
noun, (e.g., layer(s) to mean a layer or layers, etc.).
<BR>
ADDITION POLYMER FROM UNSATURATED MONOMERS
<BR>
Any multiunit chain which is the product of the reaction of
unsaturated bonds in the units. The product may be the result
of interaction of molecules of the same compound (as
polyethylene) or of different compounds (as
acryronitrile-styrene).  Vinyl acetate and methyl
methacrylate are included within the scope of the term
because the monomeric units are linked through the reacted
unsaturated bonds and the ester groups are pendant - i.e.,
the units are not linked through the ester groups.
(Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
ALDEHYDE OR KETONE CONDENSATION PRODUCT
<BR>
A resin resulting from the reaction of an aldehyde or a
ketone and a polyfunctional active hydrogen containing
compound, which, with the elimination of water, produces a
chain of alkylidene units alternating with the residue of the
hydrogen supplying compound. Phenol formaldehyde, urea
formaldehyde and polyamino (e.g., melamine) aldehyde or
furfural resins are within the scope of the term.
(Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
ANIMAL MEMBRANE
<BR>

definition.   (Structural)
<BR>
FIBER
<BR>
A relatively short, slender, flexible element of macroscopic
size and finite length and having a width and thickness of
the same order of magnitude.  A fiber is generally of staple
length to facilitate its being spun, twisted or otherwise
secured together into a composite strand but may be of
shorter length requiring bonding, felting or matting to form
a strand or layer.  It may be of animal (e.g., wool, rabbit
hair), vegetable (e.g., cotton, jute, hemp), or mineral
(e.g., asbestos, glass, metal) origin and may be either
natural, modified or synthetic.  See also Filament.
<BR>

(Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
GRAPHITE
<BR>
Inorganic material as is carbon. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>

<BR>
See natural oil, gum, rosin or lac below. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
INTERMEDIATE-ARTICLE
<BR>
A fully shaped article, all three dimensions of which are
definite, even though one or more of these dimensions may be
negligible. The article is not suitable for functional use in
the claimed condition, but must be subjected to one or more
further significant shaping steps to do more than merely
occupy space. The following operations have been regarded as
not involving a further significant shaping: (a) Assembling
or uniting the article with other parts. (b) Distorting the
article during an assembly operation to cause the article to
conform to discrepancies in the size or shape of a coacting
part. (c) Bonding or distorting those portions of the article
which are to function as means for fastening the article to a
coacting part, as, for example, the bending of ears or tabs.
(Structural)
<BR>
LAC
<BR>
See natural oil, gum, rosin or lac below. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
LAYER
<BR>
A single thickness of material(s) in the form of web* or
sheet*, or a plurality of any of these in side-by-side
coplanar relation; or particulate material arranged in
continuity to constitute a distinct stratum.  A layer may
include a plurality of components* as in Figure 2.  See also
(2) Note under A, above.  (Structural) [figure]
<BR>

METAL
<BR>
A material having a continuous phase of any element of the
periodic table except hydrogen, a noble gas, a halogen, a
chalcogen (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium), nitrogen,
phosphorus, carbon and boron. Elemental silicon is considered
to be a metal, but a silicon compound is not considered to be
a metal compound on the basis of silicon content.  The term
"metal compound" in a subclass title does not include glass
or asbestos, unless specifically included by title or
definition.  The metal may be a pure metal or an alloy as
defined in Class 75, Specialized Metallurgical Processes,
Compositions for Use Therein, Consolidated Metal Powder
Compositions, and Loose Metal Particulate Mixtures, subclass
122, (1) Note. An intermetallic compound of two or more
metals, e.g., a metal silicide, aluminide, etc., is
considered to be an alloy. (Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
METALLIC
<BR>
Composed entirely of metal* or having adjacent metal
components. Since autogenous bonding of two metallic parts is
thought to involve inherently either a diffusion or alloying
between constituents of the two parts, this diffusion or
alloy layer, even though of appreciable thickness, does not
prevent the undiffused or unalloyed regions from being
considered.  (Structural)
<BR>
NATURAL OIL OR GUM, ROSIN OR LAC
<BR>
Any oil, gum or resin that occurs in nature, as cottonseed,
linseed and castor oils, rosin, mineral oil and the exudation
of insects known as lac. These three classes of oil; drying,
semidrying and nondrying oil are included within the scope of
the term. (Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
NATURAL RUBBER
<BR>
Containing the natural gum, know as caoutchouc, gutta percha,
or balata obtained from the latex or sap of "rubber" trees.
The word "rubber" standing alone is considered to denote
natural rubber. (Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
NOBLE METALS
<BR>

Composition)
<BR>
PAPER
<BR>
Unless otherwise specified, is a sheet or web of waterlaid
felted cellulosic fibers.  May also be made of asbestos,
mineral or synthetic fibers or blends of fibers, but must be

subclass other than cellulosic or paper. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
PARTICLE
<BR>

without magnitude although possessing inertia and the force
of attraction.  (Structural)
<BR>
POLYAMIDE
<BR>
A polymeric compound containing amide groups through which
the monomers are linearly linked, except urea-aldehyde (for
which see alddhyde or ketone condensation product). The term
includes 1, the reaction products of polyamines and polybasic
acids or 2, the polymer of amino acids (e.g., nylon, peptides
and proteins). The manner in which the amide groups linearly
link the monomers or moieties, of which the chain is built is
s:graphically indicated by the below: (Nonstructural or
Composition) [figure]
<BR>
(1)  Note.  Wheat paste, which contains gluten, is considered
to be a polyamide.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  Polyamide also includes polyimide.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  Urea-aldehyde condensation product is not
included within the definition of polyamide since the product
is significantly different from other polyamide resins and
are similar to phenol-aldehyde resins. Hence, urea-aldehyde
products are placed in the subclass providing for
aldehyde-ketone condensation products.
<BR>
POLY(AMIDO-ESTER)
<BR>
A compound which is a polymer of linearly recurring amide and
<BR>
ester linkages. The monomers do not have to have an
equivalent number of amide and ester groups and they do not
have to occur in a regular pattern.  The products of (1) a)
polybasic acids b) polyhydric alcohols and c) polyamines or,
(2) a mixture of hydroxy acids and amino acids or (3)
polybasic acids and hydroxy amines are within the scope of
the term.  (Polyurethane is exemplary): The manner in which
the ester and amide groups linearly link the monomers or
moieties, of which the chain is built, is s:graphically
indicated by the below structure. The ester groups need not
be carboxylic esters but may be, e.g., sulfate ester groups.
(Nonstructural or Composition) [figure]
<BR>
POLYESTER
<BR>
A polymeric compound containing ester groups through which
the monomers are linearly linked to each other. The manner in
which the ester groups linearly link the monomers or
moieties, of which the chain is built, is s:graphically
indicated by the below structure. The ester groups need not
be carboxylic esters but may also be, e.g., sulfate ester
groups. (Nonstructural or Composition) [figure]
<BR>
POLYIMICAL
<BR>
Included within the term polyamide. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
PORE
<BR>
A tiny opening, usually microscopic, through which certain
fluids may pass.  Generally, the pore opening is of such
irregular direction that light will not pass through it.
(Structural)
<BR>
POWDER
<BR>
A mass of particles, that is, portions of matter so small
that they are not ordinarily handled as individual units.
According to Metals Handbook, 8th Edition, 1961, volume 1,
page 28, powders currently used in powder metallurgy had a
particle size within the range of 0.1 to 1000 microns in
their largest dimension, as determined by screens or other
suitable instruments.  Powder particles generally are
distinguished from filamentary particles in that their shape
and length-to-diameter ratio are such that in the dry state
the particles will not hold together as a massive article
without the application of pressure or heat.  (Structural)
<BR>
QUARTZ
<BR>
A fused silicon dioxide (silica). (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
REFRACTORY

A portion of web* material of finite length, whose width is
greater than its thickness, and which may be of any
perimetric shape (e.g., triangle, circle, etc.).
(Structural)
<BR>
STOCK-MATERIAL

A sheet*, web*, rod*, strand*, tube or block, mass or layer.
(Structural)
<BR>
STRAND
<BR>
A relatively slender and flexible element* having a width and
thickness of the same order of magnitude and a length which
is either (a) indeterminate or (b) coextensive with the
length or width of a sheet* or layer* with which it may be
associated.  A strand may be a monofilament or it may include
either a plurality of filaments* or fibers* disposed in
parallelism (e.g., tow) or constituent fibers* and/or
filaments* knitted, plaited, braided, twisted, interlaced,
interlocked or otherwise secured together to form a unit such
as roving, thread, yarn, cord, rope or cable.  (Structural)
<BR>
STRAND-PORTION
<BR>
A strand* of finite length; or an unsevered but determinate
length of a strand.  (Structural)
<BR>
STRIP
<BR>
A web* or sheet* or relatively narrow ribbon-like material.
A strip which is interwoven or intertangled with other strips
or with strands, in the same manner as a strand, will be
termed a "strand-like strip".  (Structural)
<BR>
SUBSTRATE
<BR>
See Base*.  (Structural)
<BR>
TEXTILE
<BR>

physical characteristics of a wax or is a recognized wax (as
carnauba). (Nonstructural or Composition)
<BR>
WEB
<BR>
A portion of material having length and width each greater
than its thickness and with at least its longitudinal
dimension indeterminate. A web may comprise (a) a single
thickness of material or (b) a plurality of portions of a
single piece of material folded on each other longitudinally
or transversely, or (c) a plurality of individual web
components* joined together in longitudinally coextensive
face or edge contact to form a composite web.  (Structural)
<BR>
(1)  Note.  Unless clearly disclosed or claimed otherwise
(e.g., as a rod*, mass*, filament*, etc.) a product will be
placed in the appropriate web* or sheet* subclass.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  Included under the definition of component* or
layer are the following: (a) The skin formed on a porous
layer* by curing (e.g., a foam, etc.). (b)  The "layer*"
formed by impregnating a substrate to a defined depth which
must be recited either relatively to the entire thickness or
as an absolute dimension. (c) Either of a pair of layers* of
the same material cohered or adhered together by their own
forces, if disclosed as plural separate layers*.
<BR>

a waterlaid web* of interfelted cellulose* (natural) fibers*.
 A waterlaid web* of resin, polymer or modified cellulose*
(e.g., cellulose acetate) fibers is excluded from the paper*
subclasses and will be classified on other features (e.g.,
composition, etc.).
<BR>
(4)  Note.  Where a subclass title includes a "coating" or
"coat" or "coated layer*", a bonded or adhered component or
layer* is intended to be included within the scope thereof.
Thus, a product formed by laminating or adhering two separate
and distinct layers* is considered to be the equivalent of a
product made by applying a coating of a material onto a base*
or substrate*.
<BR>
WOOD
<BR>
The material of trunks and branches of trees or bushes,
excluding bark. This term includes lumber and finely divided
wood chips, fibers or flour. "Fiber board" from wood fibers
or pulp will be considered wood or paper depending on the
<BR>
disclosure of the document in which this expression occurs.
Fiber board formed by compression of wood fibers with or
without a binder (and utilized as wood) is considered wood.
Fiber board which is water laid (and, used as cardboard or
paste board) is considered paper. (Nonstructural or
Composition)
<BR>
WORKPIECE
<BR>
A stock-material* not suitable for functional use in the
claimed condition, but requiring one or more further
significant shaping steps to do more than occupy space.
Usually it is the cross-sectional configuration which is to

This subclass is indented under subclass 221.  Subject matter
which consists of at least two components, at least one of
which has internal spaces either containing at least a gas

<BR>
(1)  Note.  This subclass and its indented subclasses have
<BR>
been established to provide a search field for those
inventions in stock material in which the void-containing
nature of a component is the essence of the invention; thus,
to be classified in this group of subclasses, the
void-containing nature of the component must either (a) be
expressed explicitly in a claim, (b) be necessary for a
claimed utility of the product or (c) be disclosed in the
specification and be incorporatable into the claims to
resolve an ambiguity in the claims.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  The designation of a component as porous,
cellular or permeable will be construed as void-containing.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  A porous layer or component having an impervious
skin thereon will be considered to have two components for
purposes of this subclass, the skin being one of the
components or layers.
<BR>
(4)  Note. An impregnated material is assumed not to contain
voids and must be disclosed or claimed as still containing
porosity in order to warrant placement in this or indented
subclasses.  Thus, paper is not considered to be a
void-containing component unless it is specified as being
porous or permeable.
<BR>
(5)  Note.  The inclusion in a component of hollow or porous
fibers or particles will be assumed to make the component a
void-containing component only when it is clearly disclosed
that the fibers or particles maintain their hollowness or
porosity after being compounded into the component.

This subclass is indented under subclass 357.  Product
comprising a rod, strand, fiber or filament*.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  A solid rod, fiber or strand product of uniform
circular cross-section and extending in a straight line
without deviation will not be considered for placement in
this or an indented subclass.  However, such a product, when
coated will be considered as sufficient for subclass 375 even
in the absence of structure.  An impregnated fiber, strand,
strand-portion, etc., unless qualified by structure (e.g.,
<BR>
size, shape, etc.) will be considered as composition for the
appropriate class (e.g., 106, 520, etc.; see (4) Note in
subclass 357 and (2) Note below.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  A patent to a rod, strand or fiber distinguished
solely by its composition will be placed in the appropriate
composition class.  See particularly Class 106, Compositions:
 Coating or Plastic; see also; Class 520, Synthetic Resins or
Natural Rubbers, for a synthetic resin or natural rubbers
filament.  For the purpose of patent placement in this
subclass, the recitation of molecular orientation or
crystalline structure in a fiber is not regarded as a
structural limitation and patents claiming such fibers with
no additional structure will be placed in the appropriate
composition class. Also, a patent for a fiber where the
presence of structure or the degree thereof is a mere
manifestation of the composition will be placed in the
appropriate composition class.  A fiber defined in terms of
its properties or other descriptors (e.g., tensile strength,
per cent elongation) is not considered a structurally defined
fiber.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  A patent directed to a rod, wire or filament of
indeterminate length will be placed in Class 204, Chemistry:
Electrical and Wave Energy, where a process under the
definition of Class 204 appears to be a necessary limitation
to the product. A product of a 157.15+ process will be
classified as in the (2) Note above.
<BR>
(4)  Note.  A patent for a strand consisting of woven
constituents is provided for in subclasses 383+ of Class 139,
Textiles: Weaving and a patent claiming a strand consisting
of knitted constituents is provided for in subclasses 169+ of
Class 66, Textiles:  Knitting; however, a patent for a
composite strand including either of such strands in
combination with another unlike constituent (e.g., knit core
with woven sheath) will be placed in this subclass 364 where
not provided for elsewhere.
<BR>
(5)  Note.  A patent for a composite rod or strand reciting
or claiming at least one twisted or twined constituent will
be placed in Class 57, Textiles:  Spinning, Twisting, or
Twining, but where said constituent is a preformed coiled
spring element, the patent will be placed in subclasses 369+
below.  See section VI Relation to Certain Other Classes, in
the main class definition, reference to Class 57 for guide
lines relating to placement of "yarns", "cords", etc.

formed when two pieces of metal are joined by heating or
melting the substrate and permitting it to flow into the
joint between the metals (i.e., fusion welding).
<BR>
(1)  Note.  When welding is performed, the molten metal tends
to oxidize and therefore the seam or joint is weakened.  The
<BR>
coating composition around the weld rod metal tends to
prevent this oxidation by (1) generating a gaseous atmosphere
around the fusion bond, (2) producing a slag which will not
oxidize, etc.  It is in this manner that the coating
"affects" the weld to form a better joint or seam.

This subclass is indented under subclass 357.  Product
comprising structurally defined or coated small grains or
bits of matter.
<BR>
(1)  Note.   A patent reciting a coated or encapsulated
material with claimed utility (ies) or solely disclosed
utility is classified with the composition classes.  A
similar patent with (a) multiply disclosed utilities or (b)
undisclosed utility is classified in this Class 428,
subclasses 402.2+.  However, in the latter two cases (a) and
(b) above, when the coating or encapsulating material
stabilizes a compound against physical or chemical
degradation, classification is appropriate for and subject to
the limitations set forth in one of the compound (element)
classes.  The order of superiority of the composition classes
are listed below under SEARCH CLASS.  Those classes with an
asterisk after the description are not composition classes
but deemed appropriate for further search.
<BR>
(2)  Note.   The recitation of any term, e.g., encapsulation,
microencapsulation, sphere, microsphere, capsule,
microcapsule, etc. which describes or gives evidence for a
microencapsulated product is adequate for placement herein.
Lacking such description or evidence the particle will be
considered a "coated" particle and therefore appropriate in
this class, subclass 403.  For example, a patent reciting the
encapsulated product of eugenol with dextrinized corn starch
is sufficient for placement in this subclass.  However, a
"clathrate" of the some product would be classified in Class
536, subclass 103.  (See (3) Note, below on clathrates and
intercalates).
<BR>
(3)  Note. Clathrates and intercalates (inclusion compounds),
per se, are classified hierarchically and subject to the
limitations set forth in the compound (element) classes based
both on the encapsulant and encapsulate.  See the section,

This subclass is indented under the class definition.  Stock
material comprising plural layers* or surfaces, adhered or
cohered to each other, identified by the composition of the
layers*, and not elsewhere provided for.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  Each and every layer disclosed, whether
considered in the document as a base* layer* or an adhesive
layer, is construed to be a separate layer for purposes of
placement in this or indented subclasses.  No distinction is
made in consideration of whether a layer is an adhesive,
prime coat, thin film or base*; each is considered to be an
individual layer.  For a detailed explanation of the
principles used as the basis of classification of the group,
i.e., the "layer-pair" concept see section IV of this
definition of this class (428).
<BR>
(2)  Note.  A claimed pair of layers is read in the light of
the disclosure.  A patent claiming merely metal* adhered to
glass*, and disclosing that the metal* and glass* are
actually bonded by an epoxy* resin, is placed on the basis of
the two pairs, glass* -epoxy* and metal* -epoxy*.    Thus,
the "original" copy of this patent is placed in subclass 415
and a copy is cross-referenced in subclass 416.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  In each of the indented subclasses, the layer is
identified by an ingredient, sole or otherwise; i.e., such
layer includes, but need not be solely composed of, the
material by which the layer is identified.
<BR>
(4)  Note.  A disclosure of a layer* which is comprised of
copolymerized material is placed in the first appearing
subclass in the schedule which provides for the polymer,
e.g., a patent claiming a laminate of a copolymer of styrene
(addition polymer from unsaturated monomers*) and alkyd*
(polyester*) is placed under polyester*.  A patent to a
laminate including a layer containing mixtures is placed as
an original on the basis of the ingredient provided for in
the first appearing subclass and cross-referenced in all
other subclasses which provide for the other ingredients.
<BR>
(5)  Note.  In this group of subclasses, the "original" copy
of a patent claiming several pairs will be placed in the
first appearing subclass providing for a claimed pair and
other copies cross-referenced to all other subclasses
providing for other claimed pairs.  In the case of disclosed
but not claimed pairs, only those disclosures which add to
the broad general concept of a particular subclass will be
cross-referenced to that subclass.  As an example of this
discretionary use of cross-references, a disclosure of
phenol-formaldehyde* next to paper* (admittedly old) would
not be cross-referenced in subclass 531, but a disclosure of
<BR>
a resin comprising 83% phenol-formaldehyde and 17%
cresol-formaldehyde next to paper would be cross-referenced
in subclass 531 (provided it was not known that a disclosure
of the specific layer* pair already existed therein).
<BR>
Briefly, the basic principles which determine placement of
the original copy of a patent in this or an indented subclass
are:  (1) only claimed subject matter is relied upon when
comparing coordinate "first-line indent" subclasses (e.g.,
subclasses 98 and 411) of this class; (2) such original copy
will be placed in the first-occurring "first-line indent"
subclass which provides for the claimed subject matter;
however, where such "first-line indent" subclass has a
further indented subclass which specifically provides for
more specific claimed subject matter, the original copy will
be placed in the further indented subclass; (3) an original
copy containing, for example, two claims where one such claim
is provided for in a subclass which is indented under a
superior subclass which provides for the other claim, will be
placed in such superior and generic subclass (since it is
first occurring) and crossed into the indented subclass; (4)
as between coordinate subclasses (e.g., subclasses 435 and
436) which are indented under the same "first-line indent"
subclass, the original copy of a patent will be placed in the
first-occurring of the coordinate subclasses which provides
for the claimed subject matter.  Once placement of the
original copy of a patent has been determined, a
cross-reference copy of the patent is mandatory in every
subclass in this group (411+) (or in any other class) which
provides for other separately claimed subject matter.
Cross-reference copies may be placed in any subclass where
the disclosed subject matter is considered to render the
patent a useful reference, for example in subclasses superior
to subclass 411 in this class.
<BR>
(6)  Note.  To be considered a "laminate" for inclusion in
this class at least two layers of surfaces must be indicated
by name or composition.  The laminate may include surfaces
which are bonded solely by molecular attraction as e.g.,
vinylidene chloride to another material or to a second layer
of vinylidene chloride, provided an interface can be
detected.    Where a particular "layer" of the composite is
identified in the claims in only functional terms, e.g., only
as a "substrate", the patent is classified as an original in
the first appearing subclass provided for a material named in
the claims, and may be cross-referenced to those subclasses
providing for materials only disclosed and not claimed; see
the rule of thumb elaborated on in (5) Note.  above.
<BR>
(7)  Note.  Exceptions to the general scheme of the
nonstructural schedule are: (a) urea-aldehyde is not
classified with polyamide* but with aldehyde or ketone
condensation product*.  See notes to subclasses 474+ and 524.
(b) a patent directed to a laminate of pyroxylin* (which
usually is plasticized with camphor and/or castor oil) is
placed as a cellulosic* or broadly carbohydrate* layer rather
than natural oil or natural gum*.  See notes to subclasses
<BR>
497 and 532. (c) an acetal of polyvinyl alcohol is both an
addition polymer from unsaturated monomers* and an aldehyde
condensation product* and consequently is classified in the
subclass which appears first in the schedule.  A patent to a
laminate including a layer of an acetal of polyvinyl alcohol
will be placed in the appropriate first appearing subclass
directed to an addition polymer from unsaturated monomers* or
to an aldehyde or ketone condensation* product as explained
in (4) Note above.
<BR>
(8)  Note.  All layers or surfaces as claimed in the patents
of these subclasses (411+), are coextensive.  If a layer is
claimed in terms of sized relative to another layer, such
limitation is regarded as structural, so that the patent will
be placed in the appropriate subclass above; (see especially
subclasses 44+, 77+, 189+, 195+, and 212+).
<BR>
(9)  Note.  In the subclasses directed to papers, indented
under this subclass (411 nonstructural laminates), the
product is a laminate which incorporates as the paper* layer
a finished paper* product.  For purposes of placement in the
indented subclasses, the term paper*, standing alone and
without further elaboration, in a patent will be construed to
mean a self-sustaining layer of cellulosic* fibers*, as
exemplified by paper, per se, cardboard, pasteboard or water
laid wood pulp.  This class (428) has the same residual
relation to Class 162, Paper Making and Fiber Liberation, as
it has to other stock material classes.   Thus, a patent to a
paper-including laminate, produced by a process provided for
in Class 162, will be placed in that class.
<BR>
(10)  Note.  A patent to a web, sheet or single-layer
product, of material described in nonstructural terms, is
placed in the appropriate material or composition class.
This rule holds even where a single layer of one material is
completely impregnated with a second material, with only a
few exceptions.  (See subclass 539.5, 540 and 541 of this
class 428).  Relative thereto, alloys and other compositions
of free metal are found in Classes 75 and 420; Inorganic
chemical compounds and nonmetal elements such as carbon
fabric are found in Class 423; hydrocarbon products are found
in Class 585; Synthetic Resins are found in Classes 520-529;
other organic (carbon) compounds are found in Class 260 and
its daughter Classes 530-570; other coating and plasted
compositions are in Classes 106 and 501; medicinal or
biocidal or hair or skin treating compostions are found in
Class 424; compositions of general use are found in Class
252.  The superiority of these and other material or
composition classes is set forth in (2) Note under the class
definition of Class 106.

This subclass is indented under the class definition.
Subject matter drawn to stock-material* or an
intermediate-article* which is metallic* or to a shaped metal
configuration designed for melting.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  The article or stock-material* may also contain
nonmetal material when it meets the requirements of this
subclass for containing spatially distinct portions of
different metals or distinct forms of a metal, contiguous to
each other.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  Metallic* products made up of a mere random
mixture of ingredients, whether or not such ingredients are
structurally defined, are generally considered to be
compositions, and are classified in the appropriate
composition class (including Class 148 "stock").  However,
where the product is characterized by its dimensions, as in
subclasses 606+ or by a particular internal structure, due to
a particular interrelationship among its elements, or in
subclasses 566 and 605 it is considered to be a

<BR>
(3)  Note.  A manufacture which comprises an indefinite
series of articles, whether intermediate or finished, still
joined to each other, as their precursor material was joined

This subclass is indented under subclass 544.  Subject matter
which contains free (elemental) metal particles.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  This and its indented subclasses include
stock-material* made by sintering, that is, a process in
which a portion of a metal particle is alloyed, bonded,
brazed, coalesced, partly fused or welded to a portion of an
adjacent metal particle due to the application of heat, or
heat and pressure.  Reference:  Everhart, J. L., et al,
"Mechanical Properties of Metals and Alloys", Circular of the
National Bureau of Standards, C447, 1943, p, 16.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  The particulate metal component may contain
particles of nonmetal material and a component is deemed to
contain metal particles if made from a starting mixture of
metal and nonmetal particles, even though all of the metal
may have melted in the process.  Thus, "cemented" carbides
are assumed to contain metal particles.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  In this and its indented subclasses, the
particulate nature of the metal in the product may not always
be explicit.  When the product is manufactured from metal
powder, it is presumed that some of the particulate nature of
the starting material is preserved, at least in the grain
structure of the product.  This presumption holds even where
the shape of the particles is changed, e.g., from rounded to
flattened.  Where the particles are disclosed as being fully
molten during the process, and solidified in a mass, e.g., as
in conventional metal spray coating, this presumption does
not hold.
<BR>
(4)  Note.  Mere mention of the grain structure or
crystalline configuration or a metal component does not
justify placement in these subclasses (544+).
<BR>
(5)  Note.  Mere porosity, even when a percentage figure is
claimed, or reference to an ingredient as a metal powder, is
not sufficient for classification as stock-material*,
recitation of an interconnected void structure in an article
is sufficient. See subclass 566.
<BR>
(6)  Note.  The metal particles need not be joined, or even
adjacent, to one another; rather, when a product is defined
as having a portion or component which has a metal matrix,
that is, continuous phase of free (elemental) metal, next to
a portion or component which contains metal particles, even
in a matrix of a nonmetal, it is assumed that metal-to-metal
contiguousness exists, and the patent is properly placed here
(subclasses 546+).

This subclass is indented under subclass 544.  Subject matter
which comprises at least two different, contiguous* layers or
portions, each having a matrix or continuous phase of free
metal.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  Neither a disclosure of, nor a product claim
containing a lamination to a particular process for producing
or uniting two or more metallic layers or portions will
exclude an invention from this subclass; however, see the
search notes to Classes 148 and 427, below.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  This and the indented subclasses provide for wire
and filaments, greater than 6 mils in diameter, or of
unspecified diameter, made by joining two or more different
metals. Metal wire coated with a different metal is also
classified in this and the indented subclasses.
<BR>
(3)  Note.  Included in this and indented subclasses are
soldered, brazed or welded joints, claimed as joints, which
are characterized only by the composition of the metal parts
joined and/or of the filler metal. Where merely a "weld
deposit" is claimed, the claimed subject matter is considered
to be merely a composition for a composition class, e.g.,
Class 420, subclasses 122.1+.
<BR>
(4)  Note.  The term "base-metal", as used in the subclass
titles indented hereunder, means a content of a particular
metal or group of metals of more than 40 percent.
<BR>
(5)  Note.  The term "alternative", as used in the subclass
<BR>
titles indented hereunder, means that the base metal of a
component may be either one of the metals or metal groups of
the title, or may be a combination of such metals. Further,
the alternativeness need not be expressed in a single claim
or "Markush" group, but may be based upon different claims;
thus, a patent having one claim to a lead-coated iron
composite and another claim to a tin-coated iron composite is
proper for classification in subclass 644 and need not be
cross-referenced elsewhere on the basis of these two claims.
<BR>
(6)  Note.  Where a "diffusion" layer or portion is claimed,
made by interdiffusion during heat treatment of materials
from two adjacent metal layers or portions, the diffusion
layer or portion is ignored in classifying the patent.
<BR>
(7)  Note.  Placing of original and cross-reference patents.
<BR>
I.  It is necessary to provide an original or cross-reference
copy of a patent in this or the subclasses indented
hereunder, for, at most, only each interface of the composite
material; thus, a two-layer composite is provided for
completely in the first-appearing subclass which provides for
either layer.Where a three-layer material is claimed (e.g.,
two pieces of aluminum alloy soldered together with a
tin-lead solder) and the composition of the central layer is
provided for in the schedule ahead of the subclasses provided
for the composition of either outer layer, placement of the
patent original or cross-reference in the first-appearing
subclass (e.g., 643) will suffice.
<BR>
II. Where a composite not suitable for placement in
subclasses 616+, 620 or 621+ is described in the claims only
on the basis of the functional characteristics of the
components, e.g., "solder", "hard metal", etc., it is placed
as an original in subclass 686 and may be cross-referenced
elsewhere, when desired, on the basis of the disclosed
composition of its components.
<BR>
III. Where the entire composite is claimed as being
deflectable by a temperature change, it is classified as an
original in subclasses 616+ and cross-referenced below only
when the subclasses indented under subclass 616 do not
specifically provide for the interfaces claimed or otherwise
of interest.
<BR>
IV. Where the metal composite, in addition, has a layer or
portion composed of a nonmetal composition, that is, a
composition having a continuous nonmetal phase, it is placed
as an original in subclasses 621+ and cross-referenced below
on the basis of the metal-to-metal interface(s).
<BR>
V. Where only one component of a composite is claimed in
terms of its composition, or a name which is equivalent to a
composition, e.g., "stainless steel", the patent is placed as
an original in the first-appearing subclass which provides
for that composition and may be cross-referenced elsewhere on
the basis of the disclosed composition of the other
<BR>
components.
<BR>
(8)  Note.  This subclass (615) is the locus for composite*
stock-material* in which one of the components* has an
alkali-metal base, that is, lithium, sodium, potassium,
rubidium, cesium or francium, or in which only a minor
ingredient of a component is identified.

<BR>
(1)  Note.  This is an experimental "Markush"- type subclass
designed to provide, for classification and search purposes,
the kind of convenience and compactness offered by "Markush"
claiming in patents, primarily by reducing the amount of
cross-referencing which is required. So far as patent
placement is concerned, a patent placed in a "Markush"
subclass is not cross-referenced to subclasses which provide
for species covered by the generic "Markush" subclass,
although it may be desirable to cross-reference the patent to
indented subclass on the basis of the combination of layers.
Thus, a patent placed in this subclass (643) is not placed
also in subclasses 645 or 646, although placement in
subclasses 647 and/or 648 may be desirable for subject matter
not covered by subclass 644.
<BR>
As concerns search purposes, a search for an invention
restricted to a species has its primary search field in the
subclass devoted to the species, while the "Markush" subclass
is a secondary search field; a search of which is mandatory
when the primary field does not provide satisfactory
documentation. Conversely, an invention involving a "Markush"
group comprising two or more members, all of which are
provided for in a "Markush" subclass, has its primary search
field in that subclass and subordinate search fields in the
subclasses providing for the species.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  The alternativeness of the species must be
according to the claims, but not be stated in a single claim;
that is, a patent having one claim to a composite with a
component having a base of one species, and a substantially
identical claim to a composite with a component having a base
of a second species, both species being provided for in the
same "Markush" subclass, is classified in the "Markush"
<BR>
subclass.
<BR>
(3)  Note.   The designation of a component* as a
"type-metal" or "tin-led solder" is sufficient for
classification in this subclass (643), however, a designation
merely as "solder" is not. Subclasses 686 and 927-933 have
been provided as collection places for components designated
in such merely functional terminology.

This subclass is indented under subclass 615.  Subject matter
having a component which contains 40 percent or more of a
transition metal or a combination of transition metals.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  The transition elements, as defined in the
"Condensed Chemical Dictionary", 7th Edition, Reinhold
Publishing Company, 1966, page 958, are:
<BR>
"Elements in which an inner electron shell, rather than an
outer shell, is partially filled. In the periodic table they
include elements 21 through 30 (scandium through zinc), 39
through 48 (yttrium through cadmium), 57 through 80
(lanthanum through mercury), and 89 through 103 (actinium
through lawrencium). They are all metals and most possess
colored ions, variable valency, have a tendency to form
complexes, and have large magnetic moments."
<BR>
Thus, the transition elements include the metals of the
periodic table groups listed in the subclasses indented
hereunder, as well as those covered in (2) Note below.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  This subclass (655) is the locus for composite
materials having a component which is 40 percent or more of
the Group IIIB metals (Sc, Y, the lanthanides and the
actinides) and/or the Group VIIB metals (Mn, Tc, and Re).
<BR>

alloy.

This subclass is indented under subclass 655.  Subject matter
in which a component of a composite comprises 40 percent or
more of a metal which is permitted by the claims to be
selected from more than one of the following diverse
categories: Category A:  Group IIB metals Category B:  Group
IIIB metals Category C:  Refractory (Groups IVB, VB, VIB
metals) Category D:  Group VIIB metals Category E:  Group
VIII or IB metals.
<BR>
(1)  Note.  Where the selection of the base transition metal
is restricted to one of the above categories, the patent is
not placed here.
<BR>
(2)  Note.  Where the composite has a component made of at
least three metals, none of which is present as more than 40
percent by weight of the component, and no combination of
metals provided for in a single category above is present as
more than 40 percent by weight, but in which the total of
transition metals is 40 percent or more, by weight, it is
classified in this subclass (656).
<BR>
(3)  Note.  This subclass follows the classification and
search rules for "Markush"- type subclasses set forth in the
definition of subclass 643, (1) Note and (2) Note.
<BR>
(4)  Note.  When a patent is proper for classification in
this subclass, such classification provides fully for all
interfaces between transition-metal-base components; however,
it may be desirable, when a particular metal, alloy, or
combination of components, specifically provided for in a
subclass below, is emphasized, to place a copy of the patent
in such subclass. Exemplary of such emphasis is the
restriction of a nonalternative component to a specific alloy
or grain structure, a claim to only one preferred species of
the alternative component, etc.
