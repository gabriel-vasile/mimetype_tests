of wood products (as defined above) that are not otherwise 
specifically named in this scope (i.e., wooden headboards for beds, 
wooden footboards for beds, wooden side rails for beds, and wooden 
canopies for beds) and that do not possess the essential character 
of wooden bedroom furniture in an unassembled, incomplete, or 
unfinished form. Such parts are usually classified under the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS'') 
subheading 9403.90.7000.
    \18\ Upholstered beds that are completely upholstered, i.e., 
containing filling material and completely covered in sewn genuine

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Imports of subject merchandise are classified under subheading 
9403.50.9040 of the HTSUS as ``wooden * * * beds'' and under subheading 
9403.50.9080 of the HTSUS as ``other * * * wooden furniture of a kind 
used in the bedroom.'' In addition, wooden headboards for beds, wooden 
footboards for beds, wooden side rails for beds, and wooden canopies 
for beds may also be entered under subheading 9403.50.9040 of the HTSUS 
as ``parts of wood'' and framed glass mirrors may also be entered under 
subheading 7009.92.5000 of the HTSUS as ``glass mirrors * * * framed.'' 
This order covers all wooden bedroom furniture meeting the above 
description, regardless of tariff classification. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our 
written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.

Ministerial Errors

    A ministerial error is defined in section 751(h) of the Act and 
further clarified in 19 CFR 351.224(f) as ``an error in addition, 
subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting 
from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other 
similar type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers 
ministerial.''
    After analyzing all interested parties' comments, we have 
determined, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(e), that ministerial 
errors existed in certain calculations for Dare Group and Teamway in 
the Final Results. Correction of these errors results in a change to 
Dare Group's and Teamway's final antidumping duty margins. 
Additionally, the rate change for Dare Group and Teamway also affects 
the dumping margins for the other companies subject to the 
administrative review that receive a separate rate. The dumping margin 
for the PRC-wide entity remains unchanged. For a detailed discussion of 
these ministerial errors, as well as the Department's analysis, see the 
Memorandum titled: Ministerial Error Memorandum for the Final Results 
of Reviews of Wooden Bedroom Furniture from the People's Republic of 
China, dated January 23, 2009, (``Ministerial Error Allegation 
Memorandum''). The Ministerial Error Allegation Memorandum is on file 
in the Central Records Unit, room 1117 in the main Department building. 
The index for this memorandum is attached as Appendix 1.
    Therefore, in accordance with section 751(h) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.224(e), we are amending the Final Results of the administrative 
review of wooden bedroom furniture from the PRC. The revised weighted-
average dumping margins are detailed below. For company-specific 
calculations, see ``Analysis Memorandum for the Amended Final Results 
for Dare Group,'' dated January 23, 2009, and ``Analysis Memorandum for 
the Amended Final Results for Teamway'' dated January 23, 2009. Listed 
below are the weighted average dumping margins resulting from this 
administrative review and new shipper review including the revised 
margins resulting from these amended final results:

Notification of Interested Parties

    This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their 
responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate 
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation 
of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply 
with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that 
reimbursement of the antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent 
assessment of double antidumping duties.
    This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to 
administrative protective orders (``APOs'') of their responsibility 
concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under the APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3), which 
continues to govern business proprietary information in this segment of 
the proceeding. Timely written notification the return/destruction of 
APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby 
requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of an APO 
is a violation which is subject to sanction.

Disclosure

    We will disclose the calculations performed for these final results 
within five days of the date of publication of this notice to 
interested parties in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b).

Assessment Rate

    The Department will determine, and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (``CBP'') shall assess, antidumping duties on all 
appropriate entries based on the amended final results. For details on 
the assessment of antidumping duties on all appropriate entries, see 
Final Results.
    The Department intends to issue appropriate assessment instructions 
directly to CBP 15 days after the date of publication of the amended 
final results of the administrative review.

Cash Deposit Requirements

    The following cash deposit requirements will be effective 
retroactively on any entries made on or after August 8, 2008, the date 
of publication of the Final Results, for all shipments of the subject 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(2)(C) of 
the Act: (1) For the exporters listed above, the cash deposit rate will 
be the rates shown for those companies (except if the rate is de 
minimis, i.e., less than 0.5 percent, a zero cash deposit will be 
required for that company); (2) for previously investigated or reviewed 
PRC and non-PRC exporters not listed above that have separate rates, 
the cash deposit rate will continue to be the exporter-specific rate 
published for the most recent period; (3) for all PRC exporters of 
subject merchandise which have not been found to be entitled to a 
separate rate, the cash deposit rate will be the PRC-wide rate of 
216.01 percent; and (4) for all non-PRC exporters of subject 
merchandise which have not received their own rate, the cash deposit 
rate will be the rate applicable to the PRC exporters that supplied 
that non-PRC exporter. These deposit requirements shall remain in 
effect until further notice.
    These amended final results are published in accordance with 
sections 751(h) and 777(i)(1) of the Act.
