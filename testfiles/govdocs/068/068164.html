<br>
<font  size=2 color=#000000 face="Helv">[Tax return verifies most untaxed income]]<br>
The term "untaxed income" means any income excluded from<br>
federal income taxation under the IRS code.  For an application<br>
selected for verification, you must verify up to six types of untaxed<br>
income and benefits.  Except for Social Security benefits and child<br>
support, the required items can be verified using the tax return or<br>
alternative tax documents (see the previous section).*8* In addition<br>
to these types of untaxed income and benefits, you must verify all<br>
other untaxed income reported on the U.S. income tax return<br>
(excluding schedules).<br>
 <br>
    Verifying Untaxed Income<br>
      Social Security Benefits*<br>
      Child Support*<br>
      IRA/Keogh Deductions<br>
      Foreign Income Exclusion<br>
      Earned Income Credit<br>
      Interest on Tax-Free Bonds<br>
    *only required in certain cases&#151;see the text for details.<br>
 <br>
You are not required to verify any untaxed income and benefits<br>
received from a federal, state, or local government agency on the<br>
basis of a financial need assessment.  Further, in addition to the<br>
income discussed earlier regarding Native American applicants,<br>
certain types of income are considered "in-kind" income and should<br>
not be reported for student aid purposes or verified by the school.<br>
 <br>
    Examples of In-Kind Income<br>
    (not to be reported as income for SFA purposes)<br>
      - Food Stamp Program<br>
      - Food Distribution Program<br>
      - National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs<br>
      - Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)<br>
      - Special Milk Program for Children<br>
      - Daycare provided by the Social Services Block Grant Programs<br>
      - Rollover Pensions<br>
      - JTPA Benefits (up to $2,000; excess must be reported)<br>
      - Payments and services received from states for foster care or<br>
        adoption assistance, under Part A or Part E of Title IV of the<br>
        Social Security Act<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Untaxed Social Security Benefits<br>
 <br>
You are not required to verify Social Security benefits unless you<br>
have reason to believe that benefits were received and either were<br>
not reported or were reported incorrectly.  If you believe verification<br>
is necessary, the following documentation is acceptable:<br>
 <br>
  - documentation from the Social Security Administration showing<br>
    the total amount of benefits received by the applicant and/or the<br>
    applicant's spouse (if applicable) and/or the dependent applicant's<br>
    parents<br>
 <br>
  - a statement signed by the applicant (and/or spouse and/or parents)<br>
    certifying that the amount of Social Security benefits reported on<br>
    the application is correct<br>
 <br>
    A Tip for Verifying SS Benefits<br>
    Be sure the student reports the total amount (not the monthly<br>
    amount) of benefits received in the base year&#151;including<br>
    Supplemental Security Income and benefits received on behalf of<br>
    dependent children. Also, be sure the benefits were not included in<br>
    the AGI. Lastly, if the Social Security statement shows an amount<br>
    deducted for Medicare, make sure that amount is included in the<br>
    total benefits reported.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Child Support Received<br>
 <br>
[[34 CFR 668.56(a)]]<br>
[[Signed statement in lieu of completed worksheet]]<br>
You must verify child support if the applicant and/or  spouse and/or<br>
parents report receiving it, or if you have reason to believe it was<br>
received.  This requirement does not apply if the applicant and/or<br>
spouse and/or parents report the same amount for child support that<br>
you verified in the previous award year. If you must verify this item,<br>
a completed verification worksheet is sufficient documentation.  In<br>
lieu of a worksheet, you must require a statement confirming the<br>
amount of child support received for all children in the household.<br>
The applicant--and, for dependent students, the applicant's parent--<br>
must sign this statement. If child support is paid through a<br>
government agency, a statement from that agency would be<br>
acceptable. If you have reason to doubt the statement provided, you<br>
SHOULD request at least one of the following documentation items:<br>
 <br>
[[34 CFR 668.57]]<br>
  - a copy of the divorce decree or separation agreement showing the<br>
    amount of child support to be provided<br>
 <br>
  - a signed statement from the parent who provided the support,<br>
    showing the amount of child support provided<br>
 <br>
  - copies of the canceled checks or money order receipts<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Deductions for IRA and/or Keogh Plans<br>
 <br>
Payments to IRA and/or Keogh plans can be verified using the tax<br>
return.  The deducted amounts are reported on lines 23a, 23b, and 27<br>
of IRS Form 1040, or line 15c of IRS Form 1040A.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Foreign Income Excluded from U.S. Taxation<br>
 <br>
Under the IRS code, certain U.S. citizens and residents living in<br>
foreign countries are allowed to deduct some excessive foreign living<br>
expenses or to exclude a limited amount of income received for<br>
personal services rendered abroad.  Though deducted for tax<br>
purposes, this amount is considered untaxed income for federal<br>
student aid purposes, and you must verify it. Excluded foreign<br>
income can be verified by using IRS Forms 2555 (line 43) or<br>
2555EZ (line 18).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Earned Income Credit (EIC)<br>
 <br>
[[Low-income workers]]<br>
Earned income credit is available to eligible low-income workers and<br>
must be reported and verified.  The amount can be verified from<br>
line 54 of the 1040, line 29c of the 1040A, or line 8 of the 1040EZ.<br>
Note that if parents file a joint tax return and qualify for EIC but then<br>
separate or divorce before the student files the FAFSA, the parent<br>
with whom the student lived most in the last 12 months would<br>
determine his or her portion of the EIC by using the tax rate schedule<br>
or proportional distribution calculations (see page 27).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Verifying Interest on Tax-Free Bonds<br>
 <br>
Interest on tax-free bonds can be verified using the tax return.  Refer<br>
to line 8b of IRS Form 1040 or to line 8b of IRS Form 1040A.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
*3* If a sibling would be considered dependent for the purposes of<br>
applying for federal student aid, he or she can be included in<br>
household size whether or not the applicant's parents provide more<br>
than half of that sibling's support. (The sibling does not actually have<br>
to be a student or actually apply for federal student aid to meet this<br>
exception.)<br>
 <br>
*4*  Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothing,<br>
car payments or expenses, medical and dental care, and payment of<br>
college costs.<br>
 <br>
*5* One of the following income tax forms is considered an<br>
alternative to a U.S. Form 1040A or 1040EZ: the income tax return<br>
required by the tax code of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,<br>
Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Republic of the<br>
Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau.<br>
Information from these tax returns would be reported on the FAFSA<br>
in the same manner as U.S. tax information. Amounts are already<br>
reported in U.S. dollars and must be compared to the U.S. tax return<br>
line items in order to be verified.<br>
 <br>
*6* If the IRS cannot provide a copy of the return, a Letter 1722, or<br>
an RTFTP, you may accept a copy of the IRS Form W-2 for each<br>
person whose income is listed on the application. (If a filer is self-<br>
employed or if a W-2 is otherwise unavailable, you may accept a<br>
signed statement from the filer certifying that his or her income and<br>
other appropriate information is correct.)<br>
 <br>
*7* Again, if the IRS cannot provide a copy of the return, a Letter<br>
1722, or an RTFTP, you may accept a copy of the IRS Form W-2 for<br>
each person whose income is listed on the application. (If a filer is<br>
self-employed or if a W-2 is otherwise unavailable, you may accept a<br>
signed statement from the filer certifying that his or her income and<br>
other appropriate information is correct.)<br>
 <br>
*8* In addition to alternative tax documents, nonfilers should also<br>
submit a signed statement, as mentioned previously, that certifies<br>
their nonfiler status and lists the amounts and specific sources (by<br>
name) of untaxed income and benefits.</font><font  face="Helv"></font>
