Edition: PostSecondary<br>
Part: 3 - - Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid<br>
SectionNumber: <br>
SectionTitle: Section F "1995 Income, Earnings, and Benefits"<br>
<!--Posted_Date=06/29/1998--><br>
PageNumbers: 72-78</b></font><br>
<br>
<font  size=2 color=#000000 face="Helv">PURPOSE: The EFC calculation compares a family's income from<br>
this section to the family's household size and other expenses to<br>
determine if the family has any discretionary income. If the family<br>
has discretionary income, a portion, and only a portion, of that<br>
income is included in the EFC as available for the student's<br>
educational costs.<br>
 <br>
Section F collects information on the BASE-YEAR INCOME of the<br>
parents (if the student is dependent) and of the student and spouse<br>
(if applicable), as well as income tax paid, tax-filing status, and the<br>
number of exemptions claimed. The base year for applicants for<br>
1996-97 is the 1995 tax year. Each question gives the line reference<br>
to the 1995 IRS tax form. Estimated base-year income for the tax<br>
year may be used if the family has not yet filed its 1995 tax return.<br>
However, if it turns out that the estimated information is incorrect,<br>
the student must make corrections when the tax return is filed.<br>
 <br>
When completing Questions 53 or 65, a student and/or parent must<br>
indicate from which tax form they are getting the information for this<br>
section of the FAFSA. Sometimes a 1995 IRS Form 1040 is filed<br>
even though a 1040A or 1040EZ could have been filed. In such an<br>
instance, a student or parent should indicate eligibility to file a<br>
1040A or 1040EZ by checking Box A if a tax return has been filed<br>
or Box C if a tax return has not been filed at the time the FAFSA is<br>
completed.<br>
 <br>
If a student and his or her parents or spouse, as applicable, don't file<br>
a tax return, or have not yet filed it, they still must report their<br>
earnings. In this case, W-2 forms and other such records should be<br>
used to answer the questions. Worksheet #1 on page 11 of the<br>
FAFSA instructions will help students calculate income.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
PUERTO RICO TAX RETURN<br>
 <br>
For the purpose of completing the FAFSA, a Puerto Rico tax return<br>
is considered to be an IRS Form 1040A or 1040EZ. The information<br>
from the Puerto Rico tax return should be used to complete the<br>
FAFSA.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
FOREIGN INCOME<br>
 <br>
Income earned in a foreign country is treated in the same way as<br>
income earned in the United States--that is, as if taxes were paid to<br>
the central government of that country. A foreign tax return is<br>
considered to be an IRS Form 1040 for the purpose of completing<br>
the FAFSA. A student should report the value of the foreign income<br>
in U.S. dollars (using the exchange rate at the time of application) as<br>
the "adjusted gross income" line item and as the "income earned<br>
from work" line item.<br>
 <br>
A student should also include the value of taxes paid to the foreign<br>
government on the "U.S. income tax paid" line item. (If the income<br>
earned in the foreign country was not taxed by that country, it should<br>
be reported as untaxed income.)<br>
 <br>
     FORM 2555. In many cases, if a student or parent files a return<br>
     with the Internal Revenue Service for a year in which foreign<br>
     income was earned, a portion of the foreign income can be<br>
     excluded on a Form 2555 for U.S. tax purposes. The figure<br>
     reported on line 43 of Form 2555 (or line 18 of Form 2555EZ)<br>
     should be reported as "untaxed income" on the FAFSA. The final<br>
     total for the Form 2555 must not be reported as untaxed income<br>
     because it contains other exclusions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
INCOME EARNED FROM WORK<br>
 <br>
The line items for income earned from work (including Federal<br>
Work-Study) are used to calculate the Social Security tax allowances<br>
and the employment expense allowance. The income earned from<br>
work will also be used in the EFC calculation as an income factor<br>
when no adjusted gross income is reported on the application.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
UNTAXED INCOME AND BENEFITS<br>
 <br>
Questions 59-63 and Questions 71-75 include separate line items to<br>
collect information about "Untaxed income and benefits." Line items<br>
include Earned Income Credit, Social Security benefits, Aid to<br>
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC or ADC) payments, and<br>
child support because these are the most common forms of untaxed<br>
income and benefits. Note that if Social Security benefits are paid<br>
to parents on behalf of a student (because the student was under<br>
18 years old at the time), those benefits are reported as the parent's<br>
income, not the student's income. If the Social Security check was<br>
made payable to the student, it would be reported as the student's<br>
income.<br>
 <br>
Students must be sure that Question 63 or 75, "Other untaxed income<br>
and benefits," does not include any of the benefits already reported<br>
in previous line items. The line items for "other untaxed income and<br>
benefits" are used to report any benefits received by the student and<br>
parents that are not reported elsewhere on the form. Worksheet #2 on<br>
page 11 of the FAFSA instructions will help students calculate their<br>
untaxed income and benefits.<br>
 <br>
Any cash support received from a family member or third party<br>
should also be reported here as untaxed income. In some cases, the<br>
value of housing or payments on behalf of a student must be<br>
reported. Other items to report here include:<br>
 <br>
     INCOME EXCLUSIONS ON IRS FORM. Two examples are the<br>
     untaxed portion of capital gains and the interest and dividend<br>
     exclusion. Even though they are not taxed by the federal<br>
     government, both must be reported on the application for<br>
     financial aid purposes, as they represent additional financial<br>
     resources available to the family.<br>
 <br>
     IRA/KEOGH, PENSIONS, AND INSURANCE<br>
     SETTLEMENTS. If the family is eligible to exclude its payments<br>
     to an IRA/Keogh from taxation, those payments are reported as<br>
     untaxed income. If payments to other pension funds are not<br>
     excluded for tax purposes, they would already be included in<br>
     adjusted gross income. A student should report money paid into<br>
     tax-sheltered or deferred annuities (whether paid directly or<br>
     withheld from earnings). In addition, any payments from a<br>
     pension, annuity, or insurance settlement must be reported on the<br>
     application, either as taxable income or untaxed income, as<br>
     appropriate. The full amount of the distribution must be reported,<br>
     whether it was a lump-sum or an annual distribution. The only<br>
     exception to reporting pension distributions as income is when the<br>
     pension distribution is "rolled over" to another retirement plan in<br>
     the same tax year.<br>
 <br>
     BENEFITS RECEIVED ON BEHALF OF DEPENDENTS. Any<br>
     benefits received by the head of household on behalf of persons<br>
     included in household size (Section E) must be reported as income<br>
     to the head of the household. However, if members of the household,<br>
     such as an uncle or grandmother, receive benefits in their own<br>
     names, those benefits are not reported as income of the head of<br>
     household. Remember that the student's siblings and "other persons"<br>
     may not be included in household size if they receive in their own<br>
     names more than half of their support through such benefits. Note<br>
     that because student financial aid is not counted as income, tuition<br>
     benefits a parent receives for a dependent (for example, from the<br>
     parent's employer) are not included as untaxed income but as a<br>
     resource and as estimated financial assistance.<br>
 <br>
     UNDERPAYMENTS AND OVERPAYMENTS OF BENEFITS.<br>
     The actual amount of benefits received for the year in question must<br>
     be reported, even if that amount represents an underpayment or an<br>
     overpayment that may be compensated for in the next year. This<br>
     parallels the IRS treatment of overpayments of taxable income (such<br>
     as salary) that must be reported and are taxed as any other income.<br>
     However, if the underpayment or overpayment was adjusted in the<br>
     same year, only the net amount received during that year would be<br>
     reported.<br>
 <br>
     CASH SUPPORT TO STUDENT. Any cash support that the student<br>
     receives from a friend or a relative (other than the parent, if the<br>
     student is dependent) must be reported as untaxed income. Cash<br>
     support includes payments made on behalf of the student. For<br>
     instance, if the student's aunt pays the student's rent or utility bill,<br>
     the student must report those payments as untaxed income on the<br>
     application.<br>
 <br>
     HOUSING ALLOWANCES. Housing allowances provided to the<br>
     parents or student must be reported. This applies to compensation<br>
     that some people, particularly clergy and military personnel, receive<br>
     for their jobs. If the parent or student receives money to pay rent, he<br>
     or she should list the amount of money received. If the parent<br>
     receives use of a house or apartment, he or she should report the<br>
     amount that he or she would pay to rent a comparable house or<br>
     apartment (market value). Similarly, if the student received free<br>
     room and board in the base year for a job that was not awarded as<br>
     student financial aid, the student must report the value of the room<br>
     and board as untaxed income.  (This category, "housing allowances,"<br>
     excludes rent subsidies for low-income housing.)<br>
 <br>
There are some cases in which income and benefits received by the<br>
student or parent should not be reported on the application.<br>
Worksheet #2 lists types of income and benefits that should not be<br>
included as untaxed income.  Some of these are:<br>
 <br>
     STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. Student aid is not counted as<br>
     income; it has no effect on the amount of a Federal Pell Grant the<br>
     student receives and is already taken into account as resources for<br>
     campus-based aid and as estimated financial assistance for<br>
     Stafford.<br>
 <br>
     FOOD STAMPS. Food stamps are not counted as untaxed<br>
     income; they are regarded as "in-kind" assistance. Similarly,<br>
     benefits from the following programs are not counted as untaxed<br>
     income: Women, Infants, and Children Program; Food<br>
     Distribution Program; Commodity Supplemental Food Program;<br>
     National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs; Summer<br>
     Food Service Program; and Special Milk Program for Children.<br>
 <br>
     CHILD-CARE BENEFITS. The worth of day-care services provided<br>
     by the Child Care Program and the Social Services Block Grant<br>
     Programs should not be reported, as they are a form of in-kind<br>
     income. (Note: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br>
     provides reimbursement for child-care expenses incurred by welfare<br>
     recipients through Aid to Families with Dependent Children<br>
     [AFDC]). These benefits are reported on the application because the<br>
     individual bills the state for the amount of child-care costs incurred<br>
     while on welfare and is reimbursed on that basis.)<br>
 <br>
     PER CAPITA PAYMENTS TO NATIVE AMERICANS. Per<br>
     capita payments received in 1995 from the Per Capita Act or the<br>
     Distribution of Judgment Funds Act should not be reported unless<br>
     they exceed $2,000. Thus, if an individual payment were $1,500, it<br>
     would not be reported on an application. However, if the payment<br>
     were $2,500, the amount that exceeds $2,000--$500--would be<br>
     reported as untaxed income.<br>
 <br>
     HEATING/FUEL ASSISTANCE. Exclude from consideration as<br>
     income or resources any payments or allowances received under the<br>
     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act (LIHEA). (Note:<br>
     Payments under the LIHEA are made through state programs that<br>
     may have different names.)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
EXCLUSIONS FROM TAXED INCOME<br>
 <br>
Questions 64 and 76 ask for the total of income and benefits that are<br>
to be excluded from taxable income. Worksheet #3 on page 12 of the<br>
FAFSA instructions will help students calculate exclusions for<br>
amounts included in taxed income, such as work-study earnings.<br>
Because the items listed in this worksheet will be entered on the form<br>
and excluded from income in the calculation, the student should not<br>
subtract them from the income listed in Questions 56-58 or 68-70.<br>
These amounts should be calculated on the basis of what was<br>
received between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1995, NOT ON<br>
WHAT WAS RECEIVED DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR.<br>
 <br>
     GRANT AND SCHOLARSHIP AID. Any grant and scholarship<br>
     aid that was reported on the student's 1995 income tax form<br>
     (because it was in excess of tuition, fees, books, and required<br>
     supplies) should be reported as an exclusion.<br>
 <br>
     WORK-STUDY EARNINGS. Earnings from work are reported<br>
     as income on the financial aid application as part of AGI or<br>
     income earned. However, if those earnings are part of a financial<br>
     aid package and are intended as need-based financial assistance<br>
     to the student, they are also reported as an exclusion from taxed<br>
     income.<br>
 <br>
     NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE LIVING<br>
     ALLOWANCE AND BENEFITS. The National and Community<br>
     Service Trust Act of 1993 allows young adults to earn<br>
     postsecondary tuition funds by filling unmet community needs.<br>
     Any living allowance or benefits received under this program<br>
     should be reported as an exclusion.  Any earnings received under<br>
     this program are not reported as an exclusion.<br>
 <br>
     CHILD-SUPPORT PAYMENTS. Any child-support payments<br>
     made during 1995 by the student, spouse, or parent whose income<br>
     is reported on the FAFSA should be reported as an exclusion.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
QUESTIONS ABOUT REPORTING INCOME<br>
 <br>
These are some of the most common questions about reporting<br>
income that are received at the Department's Federal Student Aid<br>
Information Center.<br>
 <br>
WHY DO YOU ASK FOR INCOME INFORMATION FROM THE<br>
YEAR BEFORE THE STUDENT GOES TO SCHOOL?<br>
 <br>
Studies have consistently shown that verifiable income tax<br>
information from the base year (1995 for the 1996-97 award year) is<br>
more accurate than projected (1996) information when estimating<br>
how much the family will be able to contribute during the coming<br>
school year.<br>
 <br>
WHAT SHOULD THE STUDENT DO IF THE FAMILY HAS<br>
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AREN'T MENTIONED IN<br>
THE APPLICATION?<br>
 <br>
Talk to the financial aid administrator. If a family's circumstances<br>
have changed from the base year (1995) due to loss of employment,<br>
loss of benefits, or death or divorce, the financial aid administrator<br>
may decide to adjust data elements used to calculate the student's<br>
EFC, which may increase the student's eligibility for student aid.<br>
 <br>
IF THE STUDENT LIVES WITH AN AUNT, UNCLE, OR<br>
GRANDPARENT, SHOULD THAT RELATIVE'S INCOME BE<br>
REPORTED INSTEAD OF PARENTAL INFORMATION?<br>
 <br>
Only if the relative is the student's legal guardian, as defined on the<br>
FAFSA. The student can only be considered to be dependent on his<br>
or her parent(s) or guardian, and only parental/guardian information<br>
may be reported on the FAFSA. Any cash support given by relatives<br>
must be reported as untaxed income, but in-kind support (such as<br>
food and housing) from relatives is not reported.<br>
 <br>
WHAT IF THE STUDENT LIVES WITH A GIRLFRIEND OR<br>
BOYFRIEND WHO PAYS THE RENT?<br>
 <br>
The student should not report any information for a friend or<br>
roommate unless they are actually married or are considered to have<br>
a common-law marriage under state law. The student must report any<br>
cash support given by the friend as untaxed income, but in-kind<br>
support (such as food) given is not reported. Note that the student<br>
would have to report the rent paid by the roommate as income if the<br>
student's name were on the lease and if the roommate were paying<br>
the rent on the student's behalf.<br>
 <br>
WHEN IS WORK CONSIDERED STUDENT AID?<br>
 <br>
Generally, grants and scholarships are not considered to be taxed or<br>
untaxed income as long as they are applied to tuition, fees, books,<br>
and required supplies. If the student has an ROTC scholarship, a<br>
private scholarship, or any other kind of grant or scholarship, that<br>
scholarship or grant will be considered as an available resource by<br>
the financial aid office when packaging aid but will not be reported<br>
as income on the application.<br>
 <br>
In some cases, the student may have a job that was awarded as<br>
need-based financial aid. The income from that job should be<br>
reported in Question 64 as an exclusion from income. For income<br>
to be excluded, the job has to have been awarded to the student based<br>
on financial need. Thus, if the financial aid office gave the student a<br>
"Stay-In-School" job or a job as a resident advisor as a part of the<br>
student's aid package, the income from that job would be reported as<br>
an exclusion. On the other hand, if the student got a job that was not<br>
awarded as part of the student's financial aid package, the income<br>
from that job would not be reported in Question 64 as an exclusion.<br>
In addition, grants and scholarships that are reported on the tax<br>
return (because they are in excess of tuition, fees, books, and<br>
required supplies) should be reported in Question 64 as an exclusion.<br>
Worksheet #3 on page 12 of the FAFSA will help students answer<br>
Question 64.<br>
 <br>
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH SUPPORT AND<br>
IN-KIND SUPPORT?<br>
 <br>
Cash support is support given either in the form of money or money<br>
that is paid on behalf of the student. Cash support must be reported<br>
as untaxed income on the application. Thus, if a friend or relative<br>
gives the student grocery money, it must be reported as untaxed<br>
income. If the friend or relative pays the electric bill for the student,<br>
or part of the student's rent, those payments must also be reported.<br>
 <br>
In-kind support usually takes the form of free food or housing that is<br>
provided to the family and is usually not reported on the application.<br>
So if the student is living rent-free with a friend or relative, the rental<br>
value is not reported as untaxed income unless the student's name is<br>
on the lease.<br>
 <br>
However, the application does require a student to report the value of<br>
housing that is provided to the family as compensation for a job. The<br>
most common example is free housing or a housing allowance<br>
provided to military personnel or clergy. </font><font  face="Helv"></font>
