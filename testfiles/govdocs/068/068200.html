     Subpart E--Verification of Student Aid Application Information
 
Sec. 668.59  Consequences of a change in application information.

    (a) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall require the applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary for corrections if--
    (i) The institution recalculates the applicant's EFC, determines 
that the applicant's EFC changes, and determines that the change in the 
EFC changes the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award; or
    (ii) The institution does not recalculate the applicant's EFC.
    (2) An institution need not require an applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary, recalculate an applicant's 
EFC, or adjust an applicant's Federal Pell Grant award if, as a result 
of the verification process, the institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;
    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (b) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) If an institution does not recalculate an applicant's EFC under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the institution 
shall calculate and disburse the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on 
the basis of the applicant's original EFC.
    (2)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, if an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (A) Require the applicant to resubmit his or her application to the 
Secretary;
    (B) Recalculate the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of

[[Page 483]]

the EFC on the corrected SAR or ISIR; and
    (C) Disburse any additional funds under that award only if the 
applicant provides the institution with the corrected SAR or ISIR and 
only to the extent that additional funds are payable based on the 
recalculation.
    (ii) If an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process and determines that the change in the EFC increases the 
applicant's award, the institution--
    (A) May disburse the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the original EFC without requiring the applicant to resubmit 
his or her application information to the Secretary; and
    (B) Except as provided in Sec. 668.60(b), shall disburse any 
additional funds under the increased award reflecting the new EFC if the 
institution receives the corrected SAR or ISIR.
    (c) For the campus-based, and Federal Stafford Loan or Federal 
Direct Stafford/Ford Direct Loan programs--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (i) Recalculate the applicant's EFC; and
    (ii) Adjust the applicant's financial aid package for the campus-
based, and Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Direct 
Loan programs to reflect the new EFC if the new EFC results in an 
overaward of campus-based funds or decreases the applicant's recommended 
loan amount.
    (2) An institution need not recalculate an applicant's EFC or adjust 
his or her aid package if, as a result of the verification process, the 
institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;
    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (d)(1) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for 
an award year who previously received a Direct Subsidized Loan for that 
award year, and as a result of verification the loan amount is reduced, 
the institution shall comply with the procedures specified in 
Sec. 668.61(b)(2).
    (2) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for an 
award year who previously received a loan under the Federal Stafford 
Loan Program for that award year, and as a result of verification the 
loan amount is reduced, the institution shall comply with the procedures 
for notifying the borrower and lender specified in Sec. 668.61(b) and 
Sec. 682.604(h).
    (e) If the applicant has received funds based on information which 
may be incorrect and the institution has made a reasonable effort to 
resolve the alleged discrepancy, but cannot do so, the institution shall 
forward the applicant's name, social security number, and other relevant 
information to the Secretary.
