               The Securities and Exchange Commission
("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be instituted pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and
Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ("Exchange Act") against PaineWebber Incorporated
("PaineWebber").  In anticipation of the institution of these
administrative proceedings, PaineWebber has submitted an Offer of
Settlement, which the Commission has determined to accept. 
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other
proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, and prior to a hearing pursuant
to the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR  201.100 et seq.,
PaineWebber, by its Offer of Settlement, consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings, Making
Findings, Imposing Remedial Sanctions, And Issuing Cease And
Desist Order ("Order") without admitting or denying the

==========================================START OF PAGE 2======

Commission's findings except for those contained in Section
III.A., which are admitted.

==========================================START OF PAGE 3======

                               II.

               Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that proceedings
pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Sections
15(b)(4), 21B, and 21C of the Exchange Act be, and hereby are,
instituted.

                               III.

               On the basis of this Order and PaineWebber's Offer
of Settlement, the Commission finds the following:-[1]-

A.  RESPONDENT

               PaineWebber is a broker-dealer registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act. 
PaineWebber is a member of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and all other
major stock, options, and futures exchanges.  PaineWebber has
approximately 6,000 registered representatives ("RRs") in 300
retail branch offices.

B.  SUMMARY

               This proceeding involves PaineWebber's conduct in
two areas.  The first area involves PaineWebber's offer and sale
of certain public limited partnership interests and other public
investments, referred to by PaineWebber as "direct investments,"
between 1986 and 1992.  As explained below, sales and marketing
materials for four families of direct investments --
PaineWebber/Geodyne oil and gas programs, PaineWebber Insured
Mortgage Partners, PaineWebber/Independent Living Mortgage, and
Pegasus Aircraft Partners -- overstated benefits and understated
risks of the investments, and characterized certain direct
investments as suitable for conservative investors without
sufficiently disclosing the risk of loss of principal.  In
addition, PaineWebber sold direct investments (including, but not
limited to, those mentioned above) to numerous investors for whom
they were unsuitable and in concentrations too high given the
investors' age, financial condition, sophistication and
investment objectives.  As a result of the foregoing, PaineWebber
violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and
15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2

                    

     -[1]-     The findings  herein and  the entry of  this Order
are solely for the purposes of  this proceeding and shall not  be
binding on any other person or entity named in any other proceed-
ing.

==========================================START OF PAGE 4======

thereunder. PaineWebber also violated Section 17(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder by failing to make and
keep certain required records of purchases and sales of direct
investments on the secondary market.  In addition, PaineWebber
failed reasonably to supervise certain RRs and other PaineWebber
employees who sold these products.

               The second area involves PaineWebber's failure
reasonably to supervise ten RRs (two of whom were branch office
managers ("BOMs")) in eight branch offices, who engaged in
fraudulent sales practices in connection with certain retail
customer accounts.

C.             PAINEWEBBER'S DIRECT INVESTMENT SALES PRACTICES

               1.   Background

               Between 1986 and 1992, PaineWebber sold
approximately $3 billion in public direct investments. 
Generally, the direct investments were designed to enable
investors to buy interests in real estate, oil and gas, airplane
leases, and other assets.  Most direct investment programs were
organized as limited partnerships, with the program sponsor
acting as general partner and investors purchasing limited
partnership units.  Most of the public direct investments sold by
PaineWebber were sponsored by subsidiaries or affiliates of
PaineWebber.  In instances where the sponsor was not affiliated
with PaineWebber, PaineWebber generally acted as an
administrative general partner or served in a comparable role. 
Most direct investments were illiquid over their multi-year
lives.

               Direct investments were sold to retail customers
through PaineWebber's branch office sales force, but the
marketing effort was coordinated primarily by the Direct
Investment Department headquartered in New York.  The Direct
Investment Department, also at times called the Tax Shelter
Department and the Private Investment Department (hereinafter the
"Direct Investment Department"), was responsible for researching
and selecting the direct investments to be sold by PaineWebber,
and for managing the sales and marketing efforts.  At the outset
of each direct investment program, the sponsor and PaineWebber
typically prepared: (a) a prospectus; (b) a sales brochure or
"wrapper" that was provided to investors with the prospectus; and
(c) a marketing guide, intended for internal distribution to
PaineWebber RRs, that contained suggested scripts and other sales
tips.  During the life of the program, the sponsor and
PaineWebber prepared and distributed public sales materials such
as videotapes and slide shows, and internal marketing materials
to RRs.  

==========================================START OF PAGE 5======

               RRs received significant incentives to sell direct
investments.  The sales credit for direct investments sold to
retail customers was typically 7%, substantially more than the
typical commissions for exchange-listed equities or bonds.  The
amount the RR received (called the "payout") was between 40% and
50% of the sales credit, depending on the amount of direct
investments the RR sold.  This "payout" was almost always higher
than the standard PaineWebber payout for bond and equity sales,
which ranged from 30% to 45%, and was comparable to the payout
for other PaineWebber proprietary products.  In addition to
higher commission income, RRs were offered free vacations and
other prizes for meeting sales goals.  Among the incentives were
free trips for top sellers and their spouses to Monte Carlo,
Monaco; Vail, Colorado; Marbella, Spain; and Banff, Canada;
weekend retreats at local hotels; dinners; and VCRs.  

               2.   Misrepresentations:  Geodyne

               Between 1984 and 1991, PaineWebber sold
approximately $568 million of units, to thousands of investors,
in twenty-nine oil and gas limited partnerships variously called
the PaineWebber/Geodyne Energy Income Programs and
PaineWebber/Geodyne Institutional Pension Programs ("IP")
(collectively referred to as "Geodyne").  The programs were
offered in five different series with sales as follows:

Program                  Dates               Amount Sold
Geodyne I                1984-86             $90 million
Geodyne II               1987-89             $218 million
Geodyne III              1989-91             $154 million
IP 1                     1988-90             $61.2 million
IP 2                     1990-92             $44.8 million

               The general partners and sponsors of the Geodyne
programs were several wholly-owned subsidiaries of Geodyne
Resources, Inc. ("GRI").  From 1986 to 1993, PaineWebber owned
between 40% and 49% of GRI's common stock.  From 1984 forward,
PaineWebber received approximately $48 million in sales fees, and
GRI received approximately $38.5 million in management and other
front-end fees.  The majority of Geodyne units were sold to
individual investors, many of whom had expressed an interest in
conservative, income-oriented investments.   

               The Geodyne programs were designed to acquire
interests in producing oil and gas properties in order to provide
investors with periodic cash distributions.  After front-end fees
to PaineWebber and GRI, approximately 85% of a unit-holder's
investment was available to purchase oil and gas properties.  The
unit-holders were then to receive a share of net revenues from
oil and gas production, distributed on a quarterly basis.  In

==========================================START OF PAGE 6======

addition, at the end of the partnership period, which was
expected to last approximately ten years, the investors were to
receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of remaining oil
and gas reserves.  The quarterly cash distributions had two
components: (1) income (or return on investment) from the sales
of oil and gas, and (2) a partial return of the investors'
capital.  (The excess of cash distributions over return on
investment is generally referred to as "return of capital.")  The
return of capital component was substantial because the oil and
gas reserves owned by the partnerships were depleting assets and,
in a typical program, more than 30% of gas reserves and one-half
of oil reserves were exhausted in the first three years.

               Certain sales and marketing material approved and
distributed by PaineWebber misrepresented the fundamental risks
and rewards of investing in Geodyne programs.  The materials (1)
suggested that cash distributions received by investors reflected
current income or yield, when in fact a substantial part of such
distributions was return of capital; (2) characterized Geodyne
programs as investments with a high degree of safety of principal
and suitable for conservative investors without sufficiently
disclosing the risk that an investor could lose a portion of
principal; (3) represented that the investments would perform
well whether oil and gas prices went up or down, when in fact
substantial and early increases in oil prices were essential to
the programs' success;  and (4) misrepresented tax benefits
associated with the cash distributions.

                    i.   Misrepresentation of Cash Distributions
as Income

               Geodyne's quarterly cash distributions were touted
to investors as one of its major benefits.  Investors were
repeatedly told that they would receive at least 12% annually and
RRs were told to emphasize this benefit.  Certain sales and
marketing materials both stated and implied that the partner-
ship's quarterly cash distributions reflected income, yield or
return on investment, obscuring the fact that a substantial
portion of the distributions was a return of investment.  A
public videotape used in selling Geodyne I (between 1984 and
1986) stated that the partnerships provided investors with
"Current Income" in the form of quarterly cash distributions, and
listed "Current Income" as the first of five reasons to invest in
Geodyne.  The marketing slogan for Geodyne I and II, used in
public slide presentations and on marketing materials given to
RRs between 1984 and 1989, was:  "WHEN YOU THINK OF INCOME . . .
THINK OF GEODYNE."  The public sales brochure for Geodyne II
listed as the first partnership objective "Generating Income" and
stated that due to tax changes "you'll be able to keep more of

==========================================START OF PAGE 7======

partnership income."  Certain sales materials also referred to
the cash distributions as "yield" or "return."    

               Certain sales and marketing materials further
reinforced the impression that cash distributions were solely a
return on investment by comparing the rate of distributions to
returns on alternative investments.  For example, the internal
marketing guide for the first IP program, offered between 1988
and 1990, instructed RRs to make a sales pitch to income-oriented
investors that explicitly equated IP's cash distributions with
return on other investments:

               The Sales Presentation                            

                        Ask your client or prospect what his or
               her portfolio's average annual yield is.

               - Point out that IP offers high current income
               targeted at 12+%, and that could be even higher. 
               This is higher than typical yields and can raise
               the portfolio's average.

The sales pitch continued by stating that the cash distributions
would "compound" over a period of years:

               - IP's quarterly payout makes funds available for
               reinvestment and maximum compounding.  Since
               pension funds are invested for the long term, the
               power of compounding should be particularly
               attractive to the fund manager.

The guide included a chart showing that a $10,000 investment at a
"12% constant rate of return" compounded annually for thirty
years will result in a value of $3 million.  This was a false
analysis because cash distributions would provide a compound
return only if, unlike Geodyne, the underlying principal remained
intact.

               The marketing guide for Geodyne II (distributed to
RRs between 1986 and 1989) suggested that RRs make a similar
sales pitch to income-oriented investors: "As your investment
advisor, it is my responsibility to maximize your cash flow....
By investing in [Geodyne] your cash flow should increase from
what you are presently getting on this money."  Nothing in the
marketing guide suggested that RRs inform investors that the
"cash flow" from Geodyne was fundamentally different from divi-
dends, interest, or other forms of income.
 
               Neither the public marketing materials nor the
prospectus for the Geodyne programs offered through 1988 stated
that the cash distributions, which they called "income,"

==========================================START OF PAGE 8======

reflected in part a return of capital.  In May 1989, in
connection with the introduction of the Geodyne III program,
changes were made in the prospectus and some marketing materials
to state for the first time that cash distributions might include
a return of capital component.  By this time, PaineWebber
customers had invested almost $300 million in Geodyne programs. 
The public sales brochure for Geodyne III stated, in a fine print
footnote to a paragraph describing the cash distribution:  "This
is not necessarily a 12% rate of return.  See Prospectus for
details."  The prospectus for Geodyne III stated on page 5, in
the last sentence of a paragraph entitled "No Guarantee of
Return," the following:  "Even if the General Partner's objective
of cash distributions of 12% per annum or more of Unit Holders'
Subscription is attained in the early years of the Partnership's
operations, the actual economic return to a Unit Holder might not
be competitive with certain other types of investment because oil
and gas reserves are depleting assets and a substantial portion
of the cash distributions consists of a return of the Unit
Holders' capital investment in the reserves."  In June 1989, an
amended prospectus and marketing materials were issued for the IP
1 program, which did not mention that cash distributions included
return of capital.  

               Certain marketing materials continued to be
circulated to RRs that created the impression that cash
distributions reflected real return on investment.  RRs were told
to contact Geodyne investors shortly after cash distributions
were mailed out, and to encourage them to reinvest based on prior
results.  In the early fall of 1989, a leaflet was distributed to
RRs entitled "GREAT OFFICE SALES IDEA NO. 2."  The leaflet
encouraged RRs to increase sales of Geodyne "through repeat
business with satisfied clients."  The leaflet then stressed the
clients were satisfied because they were "currently receiving
quarterly distributions ranging from 13% annualized to 18%
annualized, 60% to 70% non-taxable. . . . Subsequent partnerships
are expected to follow the same trend."   A computer printout was
attached listing prior purchasers of Geodyne and the leaflet
stressed that "these investors offer excellent potential for
repeat business."  The leaflet did not instruct RRs to caution
investors that cash distributions were not indicative of ultimate
returns, that cash distributions were high primarily because most
partnerships were still in their early years, or that absent
dramatic increases in oil and gas prices, cash distributions in
existing partnerships would soon begin to decline.-[2]-  It

                    

     -[2]-     As stated above, a  substantial portion of the oil
and gas was  produced in the first three  to five years.   As the
production level declined in subsequent years, cash distributions
                                                   (continued...)

==========================================START OF PAGE 9======

also did not instruct RRs to inform investors that the reason
distributions were "60% to 70% non-taxable" was that a portion of
the distributions were not income, or that the projected returns
on partnerships were less than prevailing rates on corporate
bonds, treasury bonds, and comparable fixed-income investments.

               Similar marketing materials were repeatedly sent
to RRs, usually at the time of cash distributions.  Each quarter,
PaineWebber RRs received a report on cumulative distributions for
all the existing limited partnerships.  The report typically had
a headline containing the words "Results" or "Track Record."  In
February 1991, PaineWebber's newsletter sent to its retail sales
force suggested that cash distributions be used to attract repeat
business.  These suggestions were followed, as shown by one RR's
letter to customers in 1990:  "As you know, your Geodyne Energy
Income Fund, L.P. just paid its latest distribution in May
[1990], and the next distribution is due August 15, 1990.  For
many of you, it will be higher than May's.  Geodyne is one of the
best performing assets you have in your portfolio!  That's
evident by the distributions of income!" (emphasis in original) 
This letter was sent to the RR's customers even though GRI's own
projections, which were shared with PaineWebber, indicated that
unless energy prices increased significantly, the ultimate rate
of return for most partnerships would be negligible.   

               In August 1990, a "bullet sheet" was sent to BOMs
in the Southeast Region and North Central (Midwest) Region for
distribution to RRs for use in sales presentations.  At the time,
PaineWebber was sponsoring "Revenue Days" at branch offices, in
which RRs, including those not formerly active in selling limited
partnerships, were encouraged to focus for a day on selling
Geodyne.  Thus, the bullet sheet was being used in part by RRs
who were not familiar with Geodyne.  The document contained a
series of bullet points that characterized Geodyne as a high-
income investment:

     1.   PROJECTED 12% CURRENT YIELD   ... a high income check   
                             every quarter... 

               2.   TAX-FREE INCOME               Approximately
                                                  70% of the
                                                  income in the
                                                  first 4 to 6

would also decline unless the production decreases were offset by
price increases.

*

               AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY OFFERING HIGH TAX-
               FAVORED INCOME WITH GROWTH POTENTIAL. . .

In seven weeks in August and September of 1990, PaineWebber sold
$63 million in Geodyne units.  Of the 923 RRs who sold units, 210
were first time sellers.

               PaineWebber further reinforced investors'
impressions that Geodyne's cash distributions reflected return on
investment in monthly account statements sent to customers. 
Before 1989, account statements listed the price of direct
investments as "unavailable."  Beginning in 1989, PaineWebber
began listing a price on most statements.  For Geodyne, it listed
as the current price the original purchase price of the program
and used this price in valuing the customer's portfolio. 
Beginning in 1990, monthly statements stated that the valuation
for some direct investments was based on the initial offering
price, and stated on the reverse side that the price "may or may
not reflect current or future market value."  However, the
statements did not disclose that the direct investments were
being sold at a significant discount to the original price in
secondary market sales.  

                    ii.  Misrepresentation of Safety of
Investment

               PaineWebber mischaracterized Geodyne as a safe and
conservative income-oriented investment without sufficiently
informing prospective investors of the risk of loss of principal.

For example, the first page of the sales wrapper for Geodyne II
(sent to prospective investors between 1986 and 1989) listed as
one of the three major objectives of the investment:

               High Degree of Safety of Principal, enhanced
               through the expertise of Geodyne and the support
               of PaineWebber Incorporated -- one of America's
               leading investment organizations -- making
               PaineWebber/Geodyne Energy Income Program II
               appropriate even for the most conservative
               individual and qualified retirement plans. 

==========================================START OF PAGE 11======

In addition, PaineWebber recommended in marketing guides that
Geodyne be sold to "Investors seeking above average income,"
"Municipal and Corporate bond buyers," and "Preferred stock and
GNMA buyers."  RRs were told that Geodyne was an excellent
alternative to municipal bonds and other income-producing
investments.  These statements, which were passed on to
investors, were misleading because returns from the Geodyne
programs fluctuated significantly based on changes in energy
prices, and the investors' principal was returned over the life
of the partnership.

                    iii. Misrepresentation of Effect of Energy
Prices

               Sales and marketing literature addressing the
effect of energy prices on a Geodyne investment frequently
understated or failed to state the importance of an early rise in
energy prices, and thereby understated the investment's risk. 
Price increases were essential to the success of an investment in
Geodyne because expected price increases were reflected in the
original cost of oil and gas reserves.  PaineWebber knew that
returns to Geodyne investors would be substantially and adversely
affected if anticipated price increases did not occur in the
first two to four years of the program because of the rate of
depletion of oil and gas.  GRI's internal studies, shared with
PaineWebber, show that its goal in purchasing oil and gas
properties was to provide an annual return to limited partners of
approximately 10-11 per cent if energy prices increased at the
rates predicted by GRI.  Throughout the period, GRI was
predicting substantial natural gas prices increases, often as
high as 10 per cent annually, and substantial oil price
increases.  

               However, certain sales materials implied that
investors would receive attractive returns even if prices did not
rise, and that rising energy prices would serve to increase these
expected returns further.  Sales brochures and scripts repeatedly
stressed as a major benefit to Geodyne investors, in addition to
current income, future growth in value of the investment if
energy prices increased over the long term.  These presentations
falsely led many investors to believe that any energy price
increase would be a bonus, when in fact they were an essential
prerequisite to achieving even minimal returns.  The sales
wrapper for Geodyne II, for example, stated that "[t]he value of
a [Geodyne II] investment should grow over time if the prices of
oil and gas increase during Partnership life."  A script entitled
"Great Sales Idea No. 2" provided to RRs in late 1989 suggested
that they call customers and ask whether they thought energy
prices would go up or down over "the next few years."  The script
then provided two different sales pitches, one for investors

==========================================START OF PAGE 12======

expecting increases and the other for persons expecting
decreases.  Both ended by recommending the purchase of Geodyne,
again leading investors to believe that price increases were not
essential to the success of the investment.

               RRs were provided a set of "most commonly asked
questions" with suggested answers to give to customers.-[3]- 
One question asked what would happen if oil and gas prices
declined.  Until late 1990, the suggested answer stated that if
oil and gas prices declined over the ten year life of the
partnership, returns would suffer.  In late 1990, the suggested
answer was refined to state that returns would suffer if oil and
gas prices remained level or declined over the ten year period. 
Both answers then stressed that this was unlikely because many
oil and gas analysts were projecting price increases.  Neither
answer informed investors that returns would suffer substantially
if oil and gas prices did not rise in the first two to four years
of the partnership, even if they rose in later years.  Thus, even
when customers asked about the risk of energy price fluctuations,
RRs were instructed to mention only the risk of long term price
declines.

                    iv.  Misrepresentation of Tax Benefits
                         Associated with Cash Distributions

               Certain marketing materials that discussed tax
ramifications of investments in Geodyne were misleading in that
they stated or implied that investors would receive partially
tax-free income.  For example, scripts provided to RRs in the
Marketing Guide for Geodyne II stated:  "The initial income is
projected at 12%+ of which 60-75% is non-taxable."  Other
materials distributed to RRs referred to cash distributions as
"substantially non-taxable," "substantial portion tax-free," and
providing "excellent after tax income, targeted 11% plus (25% tax
bracket)."  (Emphasis in original.)  By not explaining that cash
distributions were partially non-taxable only to the extent that
they were a return of the investor's capital, by characterizing
this tax treatment as a benefit, and by using terms such as
after-tax income, the marketing materials falsely implied that
the distributions were comparable to interest on a tax-exempt
security such as a municipal bond.

               The public sales brochure for Geodyne III
(distributed between 1989 and 1991) included a revised

                    

     -[3]-     Sales scripts, public slide shows,  and videotapes
distributed  by  PaineWebber  did  not  typically  mention  price
declines  as a risk, relying  on the customer  to raise questions
about this risk.

==========================================START OF PAGE 13======

description of the program's tax treatment which stated that the
partnership would generate "passive income" which could be offset
by passive losses, and that "... over the life of the
Partnership, investors are allowed to recover their investment
tax-free."  However, misleading marketing materials continued to
be distributed to PaineWebber RRs.  For example, the 1990 "bullet
sheet" described above characterized Geodyne as "an investment
opportunity offering high tax-favored income with growth
potential..." and characterized cash distributions as "tax-free
income."  As a result, PaineWebber marketing materials continued
to create the misimpression that Geodyne generated untaxed
income.

               3.   Insured Mortgage Partners 1-A and 1-B

               From April 1987 through May 1989, PaineWebber sold
$139 million of units of PaineWebber Insured Mortgage Partners 1-
A and 1-B ("IMP 1-A and 1-B") to approximately 8,000 investors. 
The proceeds from the sale of the limited partnership interests
were to be used to purchase participating and non-participating
mortgage loans and GNMA mortgage-backed securities.  IMP 1-A and
1-B were sponsored by PaineWebber Properties, a PaineWebber
wholly-owned subsidiary.  Through this subsidiary, PaineWebber
received approximately $20 million in sales, management, and
other upfront fees from sales of IMP.    

               Certain sales and marketing materials for IMP
misrepresented:  1) that quarterly cash distributions for IMP
constituted income, when in fact the distributions were in part
return of capital; 2) that the income was guaranteed never to
fall and could only increase; and 3) that the partnership
investment itself was backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government.  In fact, the return on investment to investors
dropped significantly as borrowers defaulted and forced
refinancings and prepayments at lower interest rates in the early
1990s.

               Certain marketing materials for IMP 1-A promised
investors a "predictable, insured yield."  Sales materials for
IMP 1-B stated that "Base income is anticipated to be 8 1/2 -
9%," which was the annualized equivalent of the projected
quarterly cash distributions.  Other sales materials stated that
"[t]he U.S. government guarantees the investor will never earn
less than 8 1/2 [%]."  However, the cash distributions that were
characterized as "yield," "base income," or earnings were not
solely income or yield, but also included return of the
investor's capital.  Cash distributions were derived not only
from interest on the underlying mortgages, but also payments made
to retire principal.  Some investors were not told that part of
their "income" included a return of capital. 

==========================================START OF PAGE 14======

     
               Some IMP marketing materials stated that "the base
income [for the partnerships] can only increase", and that the
"base yield can increase but never drop."  The investments were
consistently touted as providing advantageous returns in both
high and low interest environments.  One marketing document
compared the IMP programs favorably with CDs, stating that they
provided no downside risk with added upside benefit.  These
statements were false because, among other things, investors'
returns could decline as a result of default, prepayment, or the
renegotiation of mortgage loans held by the partnership.  In
fact, returns for both IMP programs declined considerably below
the so-called "guaranteed rate" as the result of mortgage
defaults and prepayments in an environment of declining interest
rates in the early 1990s.  These defaults or prepayments caused
the partnerships to return capital sooner to investors, causing
the base income to decrease.  The yield for IMP 1-B was as low as
5.89% due to the reduction of the investor's underlying capital. 
From 1988 through June 1993 the IMP 1-B yield averaged 6.44% per
year - below the anticipated yield of 8.25%.  The yield generated
by IMP 1-A (which was liquidated) has averaged approximately 5%
annually, also below the so-called guaranteed base income.

               Finally, some marketing materials for IMP stated
that investors' "principal and interest [were] insured by the
U.S. Government", and that the investment was "backed by
full,[sic] faith and credit of the U.S. Government."  Contrary to
these representations, an investment in IMP was not insured,
guaranteed, or backed by the U.S. Government.  The mortgage-
backed securities that were purchased by the partnerships were
issued by GNMA, the obligations of which were backed by the full
faith and credit of the U.S Government; however, the investor's
underlying partnership interest and partnership returns were not
guaranteed.  This was a significant distinction because the
return to investors could be affected by, among other things,
administrative expenses and the manner in which the underlying
loans were administered.  In fact, cash distributions to
investors were ultimately reduced as the result of management
decisions to renegotiate several problem loans.

               4.   Pegasus Aircraft Partners

               Between 1988 and 1990, PaineWebber sold at least
$225 million of units to approximately 13,400 investors in two
limited partnerships formed to acquire and lease commercial
aircraft, Pegasus Aircraft Partners L.P. and Pegasus Aircraft
Partners II, L.P. (collectively, "Pegasus").

               The stated purpose of the Pegasus partnerships was
to acquire used commercial aircraft subject to triple-net leases

==========================================START OF PAGE 15======

in order to provide regular cash distributions to investors.  The
anticipated holding period for the partnerships was estimated to
be eight to twelve years.  PaineWebber subsidiaries acted as the
administrative general partner for the Pegasus partnerships.  

               Some of PaineWebber's sales and marketing
materials stated and implied that the partnership's quarterly
cash distributions reflected solely income, when cash
distributions could also include a return of capital.  For
example, in the Pegasus I brochure which was disseminated to the
public, the investment benefits summarized in the brochure
include "Current Income," "Safety" and "Preservation of Capital."

Some marketing materials encouraged RRs to stress the regularity
and predictability of the cash distributions.  One slogan used
for Pegasus in internal marketing materials was "S.D.I.:  Safe
Dependable Income."  The cash distributions were represented to
be "like clockwork."  Contrary to PaineWebber's marketing
materials however, these distributions were not a measure of an
investor's actual return on investment, because they could
include a return of capital.  

               While the disclosure relating to the cash
distributions was revised in the prospectus and brochure for
Pegasus II to state that a portion of the distributions could be
a return of capital, PaineWebber's marketing strategy for the
partnership remained unchanged.  In the Pegasus II "Sales
Profile" which was distributed to PaineWebber RRs for internal
use only, PaineWebber continued to tout "High Current Income:
Quarterly cash distributions to investors from lease income are
expected to be 12% annually..."  The Sales Profile targeted
"Investors Looking For... Income" and emphasized "Safety &
Preservation of Capital" while failing to state that a portion of
the cash distributions could include a return of capital.  A June
1990 internal PaineWebber newsletter encouraged RRs to place
investors in Pegasus and "[l]ock in your 12% now."  Consistent
with this encouragement, some RRs described Pegasus as paying
12%, qualified by a reference that this "yield is approximate";
have stated that "[t]his income is partially tax deferred"; and
have made reference to "high Tax Free income."   As recently as
1992, a PaineWebber RR prepared letters to clients representing
that "the yields of 12% [on Pegasus] ... are excellent as are the
investment[s]...."  As a result, some investors were misled with
respect to the nature of the cash distributions and the safety of
the investment.

               After December 1990, Pegasus failed to pay annual
distributions of 12% as a result of several major airlines
defaulting under their lease obligations and filing for
bankruptcy protection and, as a result of these and other
developments, the value of the investment has declined.

==========================================START OF PAGE 16======

               5.    Independent Living Mortgage I and II

               From June 1989 through May 1991, PaineWebber
offered and sold approximately $127 million in interests in
PaineWebber/Independent Living Mortgage, Inc. I and II ("ILM I
and II") to approximately 9,500 investors.  ILM I and II were
created as real estate investment trusts ("REITS") to invest in
participating mortgage loans on apartment communities specially
designed for independent senior citizens.  The mortgage loans
that were purchased were loans to a subsidiary of Angeles
Corporation ("Angeles"), a California-based investment management
company,  for the development of these senior centers.  The
investment was marketed with a guaranty of payment of a 10%
annual return for six years and a total return of 125% of the
original investment from Angeles.

               In some marketing materials, PaineWebber
highlighted the guaranty from Angeles, suggesting that it
rendered the investment safe and conservative.  Angeles was
described as a $4 billion company, suggesting size and stability.

In fact, the $4 billion referred to assets controlled by Angeles
and did not include its liabilities.  Angeles was a highly
leveraged company with a marginal net worth that was highly
vulnerable to small changes in asset valuations.

               In March 1993, less than 18 months after the last
sale of ILM II, Angeles filed for bankruptcy and failed to make
payments under the guaranty.  Investor distributions plummeted
from the guaranteed 10% per annum to 4% per annum.  Angeles had
not performed on its guaranty as was marketed in sales materials.

               6.  Unsuitable Sales of Direct Investments

               Marketing materials for certain direct
investments, including but not limited to those mentioned above,
paid little attention to suitability determinations to be made in
selling direct investments.  Most marketing materials discussed
limitations on suitability only in specifying minimum income and
net worth requirements imposed by various state laws:  typically
an annual income of $30,000 or more and net worth, excluding
house, automobile and furnishings, of $30,000 or more (or a net
worth of $90,000 with no minimum income).  These minimum
requirements were not a substitute for the suitability
determination that a broker is required to make because, among
other things, they did not consider a customer's individual
investment objectives or the nature of the customer's other
investments.  The language in certain marketing materials
resulted in RRs ignoring suitability concerns by indicating that
the investment was appropriate for substantially all PaineWebber
clients without sufficiently disclosing the risks and in

==========================================START OF PAGE 17======

disregard of investors' age, financial condition, sophistication
and investment objectives.  In some instances, marketing
materials encouraged RRs to sell these cash flow generating
investments to income-oriented investors, including persons
investing largely in bank CDs and government bonds, without
cautioning them to warn investors of higher risks involved in the
direct investments.

               As a result of these practices, PaineWebber sold
direct investments to numerous investors for whom they were
unsuitable and in concentrations too high given the investors'
age, financial condition, sophistication and investment
objectives. 

               7.   Secondary Market Sales of Direct Investments

               Most direct investments were not traded on any
national exchange or other public secondary market.  However,
from the late 1980s through November 1991, PaineWebber offered an
informal "matching service" through which it would match owners
of direct investments who wanted to sell their interests with
interested buyers.  The matching service was subject to very few
rules and virtually no supervision.  The Direct Investment
Department maintained on a computer screen, accessible firm-wide,
a list of interested sellers for each direct investment, with the
seller's offering price (if any).  Brokers for buyers were not
required to consult the list of interested sellers; they could
match the buyer with one of their own customers, negotiate a sale
with a customer of another broker known to be involved in the
secondary sales, or consult the computer screen.  After the sale
was privately negotiated, it was not processed through
PaineWebber's trading system.  No trade ticket was prepared, no
record of the trade was entered on a trade blotter, no
confirmation of the transaction was prepared, and no inventory
records were kept.  The Direct Investment Department was notified
of the transaction only if a commission was to be paid.  

               Largely as a result of these flaws in the matching
service, numerous sales abuses occurred in connection with
secondary sales of direct investments.  In fact, identical units
of the same direct investment were sold on the same day at prices
that varied as much as 100 per cent.  In many instances, buyers
were not given the best price available because the broker did
not consult the Direct Investment Department's computer screen. 
In some instances, PaineWebber settled customer complaints by
agreeing to buy back direct investment units at the original
purchase price, while avoiding any loss on the settlement by
reselling the units to an unsuspecting customer at an inflated
price.  In these instances, PaineWebber failed to disclose to the

==========================================START OF PAGE 18======

purchasing customers that the units could be purchased at a lower
price.  

D.   SALES PRACTICE VIOLATIONS AND RELATED SUPERVISORY FAILURES

               Between 1989 and 1993, ten PaineWebber RRs, two of
whom were BOMs, in eight branch offices engaged in serious
violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws.-[4]-  In each branch office, the BOM and PaineWebber
failed reasonably to supervise these individuals with a view
toward preventing or detecting such violations.   

               1.  Miami, Florida

               Between January 1989 and February 1992, an RR in
PaineWebber's Miami, Florida office engaged in fraudulent
practices with respect to at least seventy customers.  These
customers, many of whom were retired or close to retirement,
generally informed the RR that they wanted liquid, income-
producing, low-risk investments.  Despite these conservative
objectives, he recommended and sold large quantities of Geodyne
units to many of his customers.  In several instances, the RR
concentrated all or most of his customers' liquid assets in these
illiquid limited partnerships.  

               The RR made numerous false and misleading
statements to customers regarding the risks, liquidity, and
profitability of Geodyne.  He told several customers, both orally
and in writing, that the limited partnerships were liquid, even
though there was no public market for the partnerships. 
Additionally, he misrepresented the Geodyne partnerships' level
of risk and, in some cases, guaranteed a minimum 12% return for
the life of the investment.  Finally, he led his customers to
believe that the Geodyne partnerships were high income-producing
investments by characterizing the distributions they would
receive from the partnerships as income or return.

               He also misappropriated hundreds of thousands of
dollars from at least eight customer accounts by forging his cus-
tomers' signatures on letters of authorization ("LOAs") to effect
the transfer of client funds to himself and bank accounts in
which he held personal interests.    

               The BOM of the Miami office during the relevant
time period failed reasonably to supervise the RR's activities

                    

     -[4]-     As of the  date of  this Order, these  RRs are  no
longer employed by PaineWebber.  






by: (1) failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into the
suitability of certain direct investment sales; (2) failing to
take reasonable measures to investigate clear signs of
overconcentration in accounts of the RR's customers; and (3)
failing to conduct an adequate review of LOAs relating to the
RR's customers.  

               First, the heavy concentrations of Geodyne in
numerous customer accounts, and the customers' conservative
investment objectives, were apparent from the RR's customer
records, which, under PaineWebber procedures, the BOM was
required to review quarterly.  Moreover, the RR received numerous
awards and was publicized in PaineWebber literature as a leading
seller of Geodyne.  Notwithstanding signs of excessive
concentration of Geodyne, the BOM failed to conduct a reasonable
inquiry into sales of Geodyne.  Such an inquiry was particularly
appropriate because, by 1990, the BOM was informed of at least
three customer complaints against the RR relating to Geodyne. 
Had the BOM contacted the RR's customers and discussed the
suitability of their investments in Geodyne in light of their
conservative investment objectives, he could have learned that
the RR was inaccurately representing Geodyne to his customers.  

               With regard to the LOAs, many bore signatures that
were obviously different from the signatures in PaineWebber
customer account records.  Moreover, many of the LOAs authorized
transfers of substantial amounts of money to accounts of other
customers of the RR, or to entities controlled by the
RR.-[5]-  The BOM should have given these transfers special
scrutiny.  Such scrutiny would have uncovered the RR's forgeries,
and his unauthorized trading and misappropriation.      

               2.  Flint, Michigan

               Between 1989 and 1991, an RR in PaineWebber's
Flint, Michigan office engaged in fraudulent trading in several
customer accounts.  He made unsuitable sales of PaineWebber
direct investments, including Geodyne, Pegasus, and ILM, to
elderly, conservative investors; engaged in unauthorized trading
in certain customer accounts; and made material


                    

     -[5]-  In one instance, the RR forged his customer's name on
15  letters of  authorization causing  over $200,000 to  be wired
from the  customer's brokerage  account to several  bank accounts
controlled by  the  RR.   In another  instance, the  RR forged  a
customer's signature on a letter of authorization designating the
transfer of $12,100 to  be used for the unauthorized  purchase of
certain limited partnerships for another customer.

                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 19======






misrepresentations to customers concerning liquidity, risk, and
income of investments.  

               For example, the RR concentrated nearly $150,000
of an elderly, disabled customer's $200,000 portfolio in direct
investments.  He also purchased leveraged U.S. Treasury Bonds in
the customer's account without her approval and materially
misrepresented the safety, liquidity, and income component of the
direct investments he sold to her.

               Between March 1989 and August 1991, the RR engaged
in unauthorized trading in the account of a young couple with
little investment experience by purchasing leveraged GNMA Pool
Certificates in their account.  Also in that time period, he sold
various direct investments, including Pegasus, to the couple by
misrepresenting that the direct investments were like mutual
funds, implying that these illiquid investments could be easily
sold.  He forged a margin account agreement for this couple and
traded in their account on margin without their knowledge or
approval.  In another instance, he prepared and mailed false
account valuations to certain customers that materially
overstated values of direct investments, thus inducing these
customers to make additional purchases of direct investments.

               The Flint office was a four broker satellite
office of the Farmington Hills, Michigan branch office.  Flint's
resident manager was responsible for, among other duties, signing
investment representation forms which memorialized sales of
direct investments, reviewing new account forms and order
tickets, and monitoring incoming and outgoing mail.  The resident
manager in place in and after March 1990 failed reasonably to
supervise the RR referred to above by (1) failing to do any
independent checks on the suitability of direct investments for
the various customers; (2) failing to monitor the outgoing mail
to prevent the RR from sending out false valuations; (3) signing
and approving the mailing of one false account valuation without
verifying its contents; and (4) failing to conduct adequate
quarterly portfolio reviews of the RR's customers, which would
have alerted him to the extensive overconcentration and
unsuitability of the direct investments in many of these
accounts.

               3.   Naples, Florida

               Between 1986 and November 1991, the BOM of
PaineWebber's Naples, Florida office sold at least $8 million of
direct investments, including Geodyne, Pegasus, and IMP, to
dozens of his clients.  Many of the customers were elderly
investors for whom a long-term illiquid direct investment was
unsuitable, and many expressed conservative investment


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 20======






objectives.  Nonetheless, the BOM persuaded numerous customers to
invest between 50% to 100% of their portfolios in direct
investments.  The high concentrations of illiquid direct
investments in accounts of conservative investors who needed
liquidity were unsuitable in light of the customers' age,
financial condition and investment objectives.  

               Between 1986 and November 1991, the BOM
misrepresented to dozens of investors that the direct investments
he was selling were liquid and could be redeemed without loss,
and that periodic distributions on the direct investments were
risk-free and "guaranteed like a bond."  In fact, the direct
investments he sold were illiquid, with no established exchange
or market.  Moreover, none of the distributions for direct
investments were guaranteed.

               In at least two instances, he sold direct
investments from one of his customers to another one of his
customers at their original purchase price when, at the time, the
investments could be purchased through PaineWebber's matching
service at a substantially lower price.  By effecting these
trades at the expense of the unwitting purchasing customers, he
reinforced the false impression among the selling customers that
direct investments could be redeemed without loss.  Finally, he
made unauthorized trades in at least two customer accounts.  

               From at least 1989 until November 1991,
PaineWebber's supervision of the BOM was deficient in several
respects.  First, his customer accounts were not subjected to
periodic review by his supervisor, as was the case for customer
accounts of non-supervisory personnel.  BOMs reported directly to
their regional division managers, most of whom supervised at
least 50 BOMs in geographically disparate locations.  PaineWebber
did not have a supervisory manual that formally articulated the
supervisory duties of the division managers with regard to BOMs. 
Second, exception reports designed to monitor unusual trading at
the branch level were inadequate to detect suitability or
concentration problems in direct investments in a BOM's accounts.

Third, the direct investment trading process circumvented any
review in the retail branch system because all orders were sent
directly to the Direct Investment Department and were not seen by
the division managers' office.  Fourth, PaineWebber had no
procedures requiring complaints concerning BOMs to be routed to
the division manager.  Fifth, there were no formal controls of
the direct investment matching service at the division level.  At
least in part due to these deficiencies, the BOM was able to
perpetrate his fraud without detection for several years. 

               4.  Grand Rapids, Michigan



                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 21======






               Between July 1989 and July 1991, an RR in
PaineWebber's Grand Rapids office churned the accounts of at
least two customers, engaged in unauthorized trades for the
account of one of these customers, and made unsuitable trades in
options in the account of a third customer.  Each of the
customers had conservative investment objectives, and two
specifically told the RR that they only wanted trades in tax-free
municipal bonds with a small portion of money to be invested in
stocks.

               Between August 1990 and July 1991, the RR engaged
in excessive trading in the accounts of two customers.  Over a
ten month period, the accounts of the two customers had
annualized portfolio turnover ratios of 7:1 and 3.5:1, and
generated sales commissions amounting to 25% and 10.5% of the
value of the customers' portfolios.  When the customers inquired
about the trading, they were told by the RR that there was an
accounting mix-up at PaineWebber.  In March 1991, the RR forged
the signatures of these two customers on account activity letters
which stated that the customers were aware of the activity in
their accounts.  In June 1991, one of the customers specifically
told the RR that he wanted no more stock trades.  Yet, within
weeks the RR purchased stock for the customer against his
instructions.

               From at least July 1989 until July 1991, the RR
sold risky investments, including options, to an unsophisticated
widow who worked as a retail sales clerk.  The options and other
risky investments were unsuitable due to her limited income, lack
of sophistication and investment objectives.

               From at least July 1990 through July 1991, the BOM
of the Grand Rapids office failed reasonably to supervise the RR.

In particular, he failed to notice or inquire into significant
inconsistencies between information contained in the customers'
account records and the RR's explanations of active trading.  In
addition, he ignored repeated "red flags" in five different
monthly active account reports relating to the RR's two biggest
customers, and failed to contact the customers in person after
receiving multiple active account reports and a Compliance
Department memorandum concerning activity in their accounts. 
Finally, he failed to follow PaineWebber practice by allowing the
RR to deliver letters intended to alert the two customers to
active trading in their accounts, instead of mailing them
himself.  This allowed the RR to intercept the letters, forge the
customers' signatures on responses, and thus avoid alerting the
customers to excessive trading. 

               5.  Tampa, Florida



                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 22======






               Between 1988 and 1992, two RRs in PaineWebber's
Tampa, Florida office defrauded several customers.  One of the
RRs sold a 70 year old retired widow direct investments that were
unsuitable because of her age, conservative investment
objectives, and financial status.  He materially misrepresented
the liquidity, risk, and benefits of the direct investments,
placed more than half of her portfolio in direct investments, and
traded on margin without authorization.  

               The other RR in the Tampa office sold direct
investments to an 80 year old infirm widow which were unsuitable
in light of her age and conservative investment objectives.  The
direct investments constituted 75% of her portfolio.  The RR also
made material misrepresentations to the customer concerning the
direct investments.  In addition, the RR engaged in unauthorized
option and margin trading, first by obtaining the customer's
signature on an option and margin agreement without explaining
the risks associated with option and margin trading, and then by
engaging in numerous margin and options trades that were
unsuitable given her age, lack of sophistication and investment
objectives.

               From October 1990 to November 1992, the RR
misappropriated another customer's funds and effected
unauthorized trades in the customer's account.   The RR
transferred funds pursuant to a signed LOA indicating that the
transfer of funds was in exchange for certain investments held in
other clients' accounts serviced by the RR.  On several
occasions, at the RR's direction, the customer signed blank LOAs
in order to facilitate the purchase of direct investments on the
secondary market.  Although the customer's funds were
transferred, the customer never received the corresponding
investments.  In fact, two of the investments which the customer
purportedly purchased by LOAs were not even owned by the
customers who received the funds.     

                The RR also purchased direct investments on the
secondary market at an inflated purchase price for the same
customer.  The RR represented both the buyer and the seller in
these transactions, without their knowledge or approval.  In at
least one instance, the direct investments belonged to a customer
who had filed a complaint against the RR alleging that the
partnerships were unsuitable, and these direct investments were
sold to other customers at the purchase price in order to settle
the complaint.  The RR also failed to seek the best terms
available under the circumstances in several other secondary
market transactions.  

               The BOM for the Tampa office during the relevant
time period failed reasonably to supervise the two RRs in that


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 23======






he: (1) did not subject the RR to meaningful special supervision
despite the RR's record of prior customer complaints; (2) failed
to take adequate actions in response to active account reports
relating to certain customers of the RRs; (3) failed to review
adequately the RRs' customer books, which would have revealed
problems in the above customers' accounts; and (4) failed to
review LOAs used to transfer investments or funds out of a
customer's account.  With respect to the RR's transfer of funds
out of the customer's account, the customer's account statements
indicated several transfers of money into the accounts of
customers also serviced by the RR.  These transfers were "red
flags" which should have triggered further investigation.  

               6.  Omaha, Nebraska

               Between 1988 and 1991 an RR in PaineWebber's
Omaha, Nebraska office sold direct investments to numerous
investors for whom the investments were not suitable in light of
their age, financial condition and conservative investment
objectives, and misrepresented to customers the liquidity, risks
and benefits of direct investments.  Many of his customers were
retired or close to retirement.  Additionally, almost all of the
customers to whom he sold direct investments had informed him
that they desired liquid, low-risk, and income producing
investments.  In several instances the RR concentrated high
percentages of his customers' investments in direct investments. 



               For example, a retired couple with little
investment experience and no financial background invested their
life savings with the RR and depended on these sums to supplement
their social security and pension income.  They told the RR that
they were interested in safe, income-producing investments that
would protect their principal.  Nevertheless, by October 1990,
the RR had invested over 72% of the elderly couple's portfolio in
direct investments.  He convinced them that these direct
investments were consistent with their investment objectives by
misrepresenting that they were safe, liquid, and income-
producing.  

               The BOM of PaineWebber's Omaha office during the
relevant time period failed reasonably to supervise the RR.  The
overconcentration of numerous customer accounts in unsuitable and
illiquid direct investments was readily apparent from a review of
the RR's customer books, which the BOM was obligated to perform. 
Nonetheless, the BOM failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into
the apparent overconcentration and therefore failed to detect the
RR's unsuitable trading.  

               7.   Spokane, Washington


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 24======






               Between January 1990 and May 1992, an RR in
PaineWebber's Spokane, Washington office engaged in a pattern of
unsuitable trading in customers' accounts.  In numerous
instances, he recommended that customers who expressed a desire
for safe investments make purchases of stocks in high risk
emerging technology companies, and illiquid direct investments. 
He also engaged in unauthorized trading and unsuitable margin
trading.  

               For example, he recommended that a retired couple
in their late eighties, whose primary investment objective was
income, place more than 50% of their account value in an illiquid
limited partnership which involved a significant degree of risk,
and provided an uncertain return.  The RR misrepresented that the
limited partnership would pay higher than market interest rates. 

               In at least two instances, after the RR persuaded
customers with conservative investment objectives to open margin
accounts, the RR began making unauthorized and unsuitable trades
on margin, causing substantial losses.  

               The BOM for the Seattle, Washington office failed
reasonably to supervise this RR.  The Spokane office was
affiliated with the Seattle "complex" of branch offices, for
which the BOM was responsible.  The relationship between offices
in a complex was not formally defined by PaineWebber procedures. 
However, between at least November 1989 and June 1992, the BOM
was responsible for supervising the Spokane office.

               The BOM failed reasonably to supervise the RR in
that, among other things, he: (1) failed to conduct an adequate
inquiry into the suitability of the RR's trades; (2) did not
place the RR under any meaningful special supervision despite the
information brought to his attention about the level and nature
of activity in the RR's customer accounts; and (3) failed
reasonably to review the RR's customer books. 

               The presence of speculative stocks, high
concentrations of direct investments, and trading on margin in
certain accounts with conservative objectives would have been
apparent from quarterly reviews of the RR's accounts.  These
discrepancies should have caused the BOM at the very least to
contact additional customers to determine whether their
investment objectives were being met.  

               8.   Sioux City, Iowa

               Between 1985 and 1990, an RR and a BOM in
PaineWebber's Sioux City, Iowa office engaged in fraudulent
trading in several customers' accounts.  The RR, who had been the


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 25======






BOM of this office until he was suspended by PaineWebber for six
months in December 1985 in connection with a questionable
commodity transaction with a customer, returned to the Sioux City
office as an RR.  In June of 1990, the RR transferred to
PaineWebber's Scottsdale, Arizona branch office, where he was
employed until January 1993.  The BOM was initially employed as
an RR in the Sioux City office until 1985, when he was promoted
to resident manager.  He was promoted to BOM in January 1987, and
remained in that position until June 1990.  

               Both the RR and the BOM offered and sold
PaineWebber direct investments to elderly investors for whom
these investments were unsuitable.  The RR and BOM also made
material misrepresentations about these direct investments
concerning liquidity, income and risk.  In addition, the RR also
engaged in unauthorized trading, misappropriated customer funds,
and forged a limited partnership subscription agreement.  

               For example, between 1987 and 1991, the RR
concentrated 100% of a 60 year old, widowed homemaker's
investment portfolio in direct investments.  This investor
represented that she had only a modest income and that her net
worth consisted of her deceased husband's life insurance
proceeds, approximately $140,000.  Over 60% of this investor's
portfolio was invested in Geodyne.    

               In addition to the conduct described above, the
BOM failed reasonably to supervise the RR in that, among other
things, he: (1) failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into the
suitability of the RR's direct investment sales; (2) did not
place the RR under special supervision despite customer
complaints and the RR's past disciplinary record; (3) failed to
perform reviews of the RR's customer books; and (4) did not
systematically review or initial outgoing office correspondence
and advertisements.

E.             PAINEWEBBER'S FAILURE REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE
               CERTAIN REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES

               PaineWebber failed to adopt procedures reasonably
designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal
securities laws described above.  First, three of the offices
described above - Flint, Spokane, and Sioux City - were at some
times satellites or affiliates of larger branch offices. 
PaineWebber began establishing multi-office "complexes" in the
late 1980s, but did not establish firm-wide procedures clarifying
supervisory responsibilities.  PaineWebber defined some offices
as "satellite" offices (which lacked operations staff) and others
as "associate" offices (which had operations staff), but did not
specify the responsibilities of the resident managers in these

==========================================START OF PAGE 26======

offices.  Indeed, satellite and associate offices occasionally
went without resident managers.  In the absence of firm-wide
procedures, the task of defining the responsibilities of the
resident manager was accomplished, if at all, by the BOM of the
central office of the complex.  As a result, considerable
confusion existed and some supervisory functions simply were not
performed.

               Second, as described above with reference to the
Naples and Sioux City offices, PaineWebber had no written
procedures and inadequate systems to ensure adequate supervision
of BOM's sales practices.  In the absence of firm-wide
procedures, the division manager of each geographic region was
left with the task of developing adequate procedures and systems,
and PaineWebber had no method for ascertaining whether such
procedures and systems had been developed.

               Third, although PaineWebber actively marketed and
sold direct investments, and provided substantial financial
incentives to large sellers of the products, it developed
virtually no special procedures to ensure that the products were
marketed properly.  PaineWebber had no exception reports that
focused supervisory attention on high concentrations of direct
investments in accounts.  PaineWebber allowed the circulation of
volumes of marketing materials that overstated the safety of
direct investments, and insufficiently alerted RRs and
supervisory personnel to suitability issues.  Furthermore, its
method of screening sales and marketing literature was
inadequate.  Internal marketing literature was not always subject
to compliance review.  Although beginning sometime in 1989,
PaineWebber had an informal procedure for compliance review of
publicly disseminated materials relating to direct investments,
it failed to devote adequate resources to this function.  For
example, between 1989 and 1991, PaineWebber assigned
responsibility to review sales and marketing material to an
individual who had failed the Series 7 broker examination.
PaineWebber failed to provide that individual with training or
sufficient support to perform the review function.  For the
foregoing reasons, PaineWebber failed reasonably to supervise its
RRs and BOMs.     
                               IV.

A.             ANTIFRAUD VIOLATIONS ARISING OUT OF PAINEWEBBER'S
               OFFER AND SALE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

               The Commission has repeatedly stressed the
obligation of broker-dealers to assure that retail sales
activities comply with the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)
of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
10b-5 thereunder.  See, e.g., In the Matter of Prudential
                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 27======

Securities, Inc., Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-33082 (October 21,
1993); In the Matter of PaineWebber, Inc., Exchange Act Rel. No.
34-31889 (February 18, 1993); In the Matter of Smith Barney,
Harris, Upham & Co., Inc., [1984-85 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L.
Rep. (CCH)   83,745 (March 5, 1985); In the Matter of Thomson
McKinnon Securities, Inc. et al., [1984 Transfer Binder] Fed.
Sec. L. Rep. (CCH)   83,620 (Apr. 30, 1984).  Section 15(c)(1) of
the Exchange Act expressly prohibits a broker or dealer from
employing any manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent device
or contrivance, as defined in Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, to induce
or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of any security.  These
sections prohibit material misrepresentations, omissions or any
act, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.

               1.   False Statements and Omissions

               As set forth above, PaineWebber made material
misstatements and omitted to state material facts in the sale of
Geodyne, Pegasus, ILM and IMP direct investments relating to the
risks and rewards of such investments, including the nature of
the cash distributions, potential returns on investment, safety,
and the nature of certain guarantees pertaining to some of the
investments.  These misstatements were communicated to investors
through jurisdictional means. 

               As described above, investors had few if any
reliable sources of information other than PaineWebber concerning
direct investments and were therefore vulnerable to misleading
sales presentations from RRs willing to disregard any
determination whether the recommended security was suitable for
the purchaser.  See generally Limited Partnership Reorganizations
and Public Offerings of Limited Partnership Interests,
Interpretative Rel. Nos. 33-6900; 34-29314 (June 17, 1991);
Suitability Requirements for Transactions in Certain Securities,
File No. S7-3-89 (SEC), Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-26529 (February
8, 1989).

               Based on the foregoing, PaineWebber violated the
antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act,
Sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5
and 15c1-2 thereunder in the offer and sale of direct
investments.  See, e.g., In the Matter of Jessup & Lamont
Securities Co., Inc., Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-16985 (July 18,
1980); In the Matter of Marsh, Mead, Hill & Associates, Inc.,
Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-9523 (March 9, 1972); In the Matter of
Powell & McGowan, Inc., 41 SEC 933, 935 (1964). 

               2.   Suitability
                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 28======

               As stated above, certain marketing materials which
were prepared and disseminated by PaineWebber emphasized the
safety of these direct investments, without sufficiently
disclosing the risks.  In many instances, PaineWebber RRs failed
to make required determinations, in recommending and selling
direct investments, that the investments were suitable for
investors in light of their individual financial status and
investment goals.  PaineWebber RRs also recommended, often in
disregard of the investors' individual needs and financial goals,
that investors, including some who were elderly or retired,
purchase direct investments in over-concentrated amounts.  As a
result, PaineWebber violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act,
Sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5
and 15c1-2 thereunder.  See In the Matter of Prudential-Bache
Securities, Inc., 48 SEC 372, 288 (1986); In the Matter of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Exchange Act Rel.
No. 34-18923 (July 26, 1982).

B.             INADEQUATE BOOKS AND RECORDS

               Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires that
every broker-dealer "make and keep for prescribed periods such
records, furnish such copies thereof, and make and disseminate
such reports as the Commission, by Rule, prescribes as necessary
or appropriate..."  Rule 17a-3 of the Exchange Act requires,
among other things, the maintenance of a memorandum of each
brokerage order, daily trade blotters, and securities records or
ledgers reflecting all long and short positions.  During the time
period from at least 1988 to November 1991, in operating the
matching program, PaineWebber failed to make and keep sufficient
books and records of its resale transactions.  Specifically, it
failed to make and keep:  1) a memorandum of each brokerage
order; 2) a blotter containing an itemized record of the purchase
and sale of securities on the secondary market system; and 3) a
securities record or ledger reflecting for each of the direct
investments the firm's long or short positions.  Based on the
foregoing, PaineWebber violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.

C.             FAILURE REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE

               Section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act authorizes
the Commission to order sanctions against broker-dealers who fail
reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing violations of
the federal securities laws.  "The responsibility of
broker-dealers to supervise their employees by means of
effective, established procedures is a critical component of the
federal investor protection scheme regulating securities
markets."  Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., Inc., Exchange Act
Rel. No. 34-21813, [1984-1985 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep.


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 29======






(CCH)   83,745 at 87,331.  As the Commission has observed: "[I]n
large organizations it is especially imperative that the system
of internal control be adequate and effective."  In the Matter of
Shearson, Hammill & Co., 42 SEC 811, 843 (1965).

               As described above, PaineWebber failed to develop
supervisory procedures and controls adequate to define
supervisory responsibilities in branch office complexes and over
satellite offices.  In addition, it failed to develop procedures
adequate to ensure effective supervision of producing BOMs.

               Finally, PaineWebber failed reasonably to
supervise RRs and others involved in the sale of direct
investments.  PaineWebber did not adequately review, supervise or
control its sponsor subsidiaries and direct investment marketing
personnel with a view towards preventing the creation,
distribution and use of false and misleading promotional
materials in selling direct investments.  PaineWebber's
supervisory failures permitted violations to continue for years. 

                                V.

               On the basis of this Order and the Offer of
Settlement submitted by PaineWebber, the Commission finds that:

A.             PaineWebber willfully violated Section 17(a) of
               the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1), and
               17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules lOb-5, 15c1-2,
               and 17a-3 thereunder; 

B.             PaineWebber failed reasonably to supervise
               individuals subject to its supervision with a view
               to preventing and detecting violations of Section
               17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and
               15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and
               15c1-2 thereunder.

                               VI.

               In view of the foregoing, it is in the public
interest to impose the sanctions specified in the Offer of
Settlement.  

               Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that
PaineWebber:

               A.   be, and hereby is, censured;

               B.   pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act
                    and Section 21C of the Exchange Act, cease


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 30======






                    and desist from committing or causing any
                    violation, and any future violation, of
                    Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections
                    10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a) of the Exchange
                    Act, and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, and 17a-3
                    thereunder; 

               C.   comply with its representation that it has
                    paid and its obligation to pay an aggregate
                    of $292.5 million for the benefit of
                    purchasers of direct investments sold by
                    PaineWebber, as follows: 

                    1.   PaineWebber has paid $120 million and
                         will pay an additional $ 7.5 million by
                         January 26, 1997, to resolve individual
                         investor claims relating to direct
                         investments, payment of which is to be
                         verified at PaineWebber's expense by an
                         independent public accountant acceptable
                         to the Commission.  To the extent that
                         the verified amount paid is greater than
                         or less than $120 million, the
                         additional amount to be paid shall be
                         adjusted accordingly;

                    2.   PaineWebber has paid, pursuant to a
                         settlement of the class actions entitled
                         In re: PaineWebber Limited Partnerships

                         in the Court Registry Investment System
                         ("CRIS"), which monies are to be used to
                         settle claims asserted in those actions
                         relating to direct investments sold by
                         PaineWebber.  If a settlement is not
                         approved by the United States District
                         Court in the Class Actions by January
                         26, 1997, or within an additional three
                         month extension for good cause shown,
                         such $125 million plus accrued interest,

                         this Order, PaineWebber shall deposit
                         $40 million in cash into a separate CRIS

                    unacceptable to the Commission's staff to,
                    among other things: 

                         (a) conduct a comprehensive review of
                         PaineWebber's policies and procedures
                         concerning: (i) retail brokerage
                         operations, including but not limited to
                         its policies and procedures for
                         supervision of satellite and associate
                         offices, and procedures for supervision
                         of the sales activities of branch office
                         managers, as is appropriate in light of
                         the findings in this Order; and (ii)
                         publicly-disseminated sales materials
                         and broker-only sales and marketing
                         materials; 

                         (b) review the policies and procedures
                         that PaineWebber has advised the
                         Commission it has adopted and
                         implemented since the activities
                         described in this Order, in determining
                         whether and to what extent there is a
                         need for additional policies and
                         procedures designed reasonably to
                         prevent and detect, insofar as
                         practicable, violations of the federal
                         securities laws; 

                         (c) recommend policies and procedures
                         (or amendments to existing policies and
                         procedures) designed reasonably to
                         prevent and detect, insofar as
                         practicable, violations of the federal
                         securities laws; and 

                         (d) prepare a written report to
                         PaineWebber's Board of Directors of its
                         findings and recommendations within six
                         months of the entry of this Order. 
                         PaineWebber shall be provided a
                         reasonable opportunity to comment on the
                         Consultant's review and recommendations.


                    2.   adopt and implement, no later than 60
                    days after receipt of the report (or such
                    other time as the Consultant believes is
                    necessary), such policies and procedures as
                    recommended by the Consultant; provided


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 34======

                    however that as to any of the Consultant's
                    recommendations that PaineWebber determines
                    is unduly burdensome and impractical,
                    PaineWebber may propose an alternative
                    procedure reasonably designed to accomplish
                    the same objectives.  The Consultant shall
                    reasonably evaluate such alternative
                    procedure and, if appropriate, either approve
                    the alternative procedure or amend the recom-
                    mendation.  PaineWebber shall abide by the
                    decision of the Consultant and adopt and
                    implement the alternative procedure or
                    amended recommendation within the time period
                    set by the Consultant in light of the nature
                    of the procedures;

                    3.   authorize the Consultant to provide
                    copies of the written report referenced above
                    promptly to the Commission's Midwest Regional
                    Office;   

                    4.   PaineWebber and its affiliates shall
                    cooperate fully with the Consultant,
                    including obtaining the cooperation of
                    PaineWebber employees or other persons under
                    its control;

                    5.   require the Consultant to enter into an
                    agreement, providing that: (a) for the period
                    of the engagement and for a period of two
                    years from the completion of the engagement,
                    the Consultant shall not enter into any
                    employment, consulting, or attorney-client
                    relationship with PaineWebber, or any of its
                    present or former affiliates, directors,
                    officers, employees, or agents acting in
                    their capacity as such; and (b) any firm with
                    which the Consultant is affiliated or of
                    which he/she is a member, and any person
                    engaged to assist the Consultant in
                    performance of his/her duties under this
                    Order shall not, without prior written
                    consent of the Commission, enter into any
                    employment, consulting or other professional
                    relationship with PaineWebber, or any of its
                    present or former directors, officers,
                    employees, or agents in their capacity as
                    such for the period of the engagement and for
                    a period of two years after the engagement.
                          


                   
==========================================START OF PAGE 35======
                    6.   maintain for a period of at least five
                    years after the effective date of this Order
                    a Committee of its Board of Directors (the
                    "Committee"), consisting of no fewer than
                    three persons, which shall (a) set policy
                    relating to the achievement of compliance
                    with applicable federal securities laws and
                    the rules and regulations of all national
                    securities exchanges, the MSRB, and self-
                    regulatory organizations of which PaineWebber
                    is a member ("applicable rules and
                    regulations"); (b) monitor PaineWebber's
                    implementation of any changes in PaineWeb-
                    ber's policies and procedures adopted as a
                    result of the Consultant's review process
                    described in paragraph VI.H.1. above; and (c)
                    monitor PaineWebber's efforts to detect,
                    correct, and prevent failures to comply with
                    applicable rules and regulations.  The
                    Committee shall require the General Counsel
                    of PaineWebber to submit quarterly to the
                    Committee a written report which shall
                    include a summary of: government and SRO

                    employee terminations for cause; sales
                    practice complaints; deficiencies in
                    supervision and controls identified in any
