      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Control of West 
          Nile virus (WNV) can only be effective if the vectors and reservoirs 
          of the virus are identified and controlled. Although mosquitoes are 
          the primary vectors, WNV has repeatedly been isolated from ticks. Therefore, 
          tick-borne transmission studies were performed with an ixodid (<i>Ixodes 
          ricinus</i>) and an argasid tick species (<i>Ornithodoros moubata</i>). 
          Both species became infected after feeding upon viremic hosts, but <i>I. 
          ricinus</i> ticks were unable to maintain the virus. In contrast, <i>O. 
          moubata</i> ticks were infected for at least 132 days, and the infection 
          was maintained through molting and a second bloodmeal. Infected <i>O. 
          moubata</i> ticks transmitted the virus to rodent hosts, albeit at a 
          low level. Moreover, the virus was nonsystemically transmitted between 
          infected and uninfected <i>O. moubata</i> ticks co-fed upon uninfected 
          hosts. Although ticks are unlikely to play a major role in WNV transmission, 
          our findings suggest that some species have the potential to act as 
          reservoirs for the virus.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The first report of a West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak within the Western 
        Hemisphere occurred in 1999 in New York City and resulted in human, equine, 
        and avian deaths (<a href="#1">1</a>). Since 1999, WNV has been found 
        in an additional 44 states of the United States as well as in parts of 
        Canada, the Caribbean, and South America (<a href="#1">2,3</a>). During 
        2002 more than 4,000 people diagnosed with WNV and 284 deaths were reported 
        in the United States (latest records available from: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm</a>).</p>
      <p>WNV is a member of the genus <i>Flavivirus</i> that contains over 70 
        identified viruses. Most of these viruses are vectored by mosquitoes or 
        ticks, although a few have no known vectors (<a href="#1">4</a>). WNV 
        has been isolated from 43 species of mosquito in the United States (<a href="#1">5</a>), 
        the most important of which is <i>Culex pipiens</i> (<a href="#1">6</a>). 
        It has also been isolated from hard (ixodid) and soft (argasid) tick species 
        in regions of Europe, Africa, and Asia (<a href="#1">7–13</a>) where WNV 
        is endemic. Ticks rank second only to mosquitoes in their importance as 
        vectors of human pathogens and transmit a greater variety of infectious 
        agents than any other arthropod group (<a href="#11">14</a>). However, 
        whether or not ticks are major vectors of WNV has not been adequately 
        investigated.</p>
      <p>Current strategies to control WNV in the United States are largely based 
        on measures to avoid exposure and to control vector species, but at present 
        only mosquito species are targeted by government surveillance and preventive 
        control programs (<a href="#11">15</a>). Resident U.S. tick populations 
        could also play a role in the WNV transmission cycle in the current outbreak. 
        We investigated an argasid tick species and an ixodid tick species for 
        their competence as vectors and reservoirs of the New York strain (NY99) 
        of WNV.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="met"></a>Materials 
        and Methods</font></h3>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ticks</font></h4>
      <p>We tested a hard tick species, <i>Ixodes ricinus</i>, and a soft tick 
        species, <i>Ornithodoros moubata</i>, for their vector competence with 
        WNV (NY99 strain). These species are not native to the United States and 
        were chosen mainly for their availability. <i>O. moubata</i> ticks were 
        considered potential vectors for the Eg101 strain of WNV in a study by 
        Whitman and Aitken in 1960 (<a href="#11">16</a>). <i>I. ricinus</i> ticks 
        are the primary vectors of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, the agent causing 
        Lyme disease in Europe and are important vectors of the flaviviruses tick-borne 
        encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) (<a href="#11">17</a>).</p>
      <p>Ticks were taken from colonies reared and maintained for many generations 
        at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, according to standard 
        methods (<a href="#11">18</a>). Colony ticks were WNV negative by reverse 
        transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (15 members of 
        each species tested). 
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virus and Viral Assays</font></h4>
      <p>The WNV strain used (NY99) was supplied by Robert Shope, University of 
        Texas. High-titer mouse brain suspension stocks of WNV (2.9 x 10<sup>7</sup> 
        PFU/mL<sup>-1</sup>) were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 
        a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL<sup>-1</sup> before use. Viral 
        stocks and the serum samples from infected mice were tested for infectious 
        virus by plaque assays on pig kidney epithelial cells as described previously 
        (<a href="#11">19</a>), by using a 3% carboxymethylcellulose overlay.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tick Infection and Co-feeding 
        Transmission Experiments</font></h4>
      <p>Seven groups of six BALB/c mice (female, 4–6 weeks old) were injected 
        subcutaneously with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of WNV. Three of the mice were 
        bled daily from the tail to follow the course of viremia by plaque assay. 
        Two groups of mice were infested with <i>I. ricinus</i> nymphs (20 per 
        mouse); one group was infested 3 days before infection, the other 4 days 
        after infection. The other five groups of mice were infested with second 
        instar <i>O. moubata</i> ticks (10 per mouse) on either the same day (day 
        0) or 1, 2, 3, or 4 days after infection. After the initial experiment, 
        and to increase the number of positive ticks available for experimentation, 
        12 additional mice were infested with <i>O. moubata</i> 2 days after infection 
        with WNV.</p>
      <p>Ticks housed in gauze-covered neoprene feeding chambers on mice (<a href="#11">18</a>) 
        were removed when fully engorged, 24 hours after infestation in the case 
        of <i>O. moubata</i> ticks and 6 days after infestation in the case of 
        <i>I. ricinus</i> nymphs. The engorged ticks were stored at 20&deg;C in 
        KCl-saturated desiccators until testing for WNV or until ready for a further 
        bloodmeal, as indicated in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. After storage, 
        the ticks (pools and individual ticks) were homogenized in 500 &micro;L 
        of PBS by using plastic homogenizers under sterile conditions. The homogenates 
        were frozen and stored at –70&deg;C until analyzed. Tick homogenates were 
        assayed for infectious virus antigen (by immunofluorescence assay) and 
        viral RNA (by RT-PCR) as shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>.</p>
      <p>Co-feeding transmission experiments were carried out by infesting clean 
        BALB/c mice (n = 7, Harlan, UK) with 10 third instar <i>O. moubata</i> 
        ticks 57 days after they had taken an infectious bloodmeal, and 10 uninfected 
        ticks (second instar) in separate feeding chambers. The two feeding chambers 
        were separated by at least 1 cm.</p>
      <p>To investigate tick-to-host transmission, 10 BALB/c mice were infested 
        with cohorts of 5, 10, 15, or 20 third instar <i>O. moubata</i> ticks 
        57 days after an infectious bloodmeal. Fifteen days after infestation, 
        the mice (including those used for co-feeding) were euthanized; brains 
        were removed, homogenized in 1 mL of sterile PBS, and stored at –70&deg;C 
        until they were tested for WNV.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Immunofluorescence Assay</font></h4>
      <p>Samples of tick (or mouse brain) homogenate (100 &micro;L) were used 
        to infect 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> C6/36 mosquito cells in a total of 3 mL L-15 
        medium containing 7% fetal calf serum (Gibco-BRL, Paisley, UK) in 30 mm 
        Petri dishes that contained glass coverslips. Infected cells were incubated 
        at 28&deg;C for 3 days. Cells were fixed in cold acetone and treated according 
        to standard methods (<a href="#11">19</a>). Infected cells were fluorescein 
        isothiocyanate–labeled with a broadly reactive flavivirus E-protein monoclonal 
        antibody (MAb 813) (<a href="#11">20</a>) or a WNV-specific monoclonal 
        antibody (MAb 546) (<a href="#21">21</a>). Labeled cells were visualized 
        by using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope. Uninfected cells were 
        used as negative controls and cells infected with the original viral stock 
        as positive controls. Tick samples were deemed positive when more than 
        10% of the cells showed specific fluorescence with both monoclonal antibodies.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nested RT-PCR Assay</font></h4>
      <p>RNA was extracted from homogenized samples (100 &micro;L) by using RNAgents 
        total RNA extraction kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions 
        (Promega, Madison, WI). cDNA synthesis was carried out with Superscript 
        II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and 3&acute;(1) primer 
        (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>) for 50 min at 42&deg;C, in a total volume 
        of 20 &micro;L. PCR was carried out on the cDNA (1 &micro;L) by using 
        5&acute;(1) and 3&acute;(1) primers. Nested PCR was carried out on 1 &micro;L 
        of the first-round PCR product using the nested primers 5&acute;(2) and 
        3&acute;(2). All PCR reactions were carried out in a 50-&micro;L volume 
        with REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). A Hybaid 
        Touchdown thermal cycler was used with the following program: 94.5&deg;C 
        for 1 min, 30 cycles of 94&deg;C for 40 s, 56&deg;C for 1 min, and 72&deg;C 
        for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of 72&deg;C for 10 min. 
        Viral stock, RNA extracted from uninfected ticks, and PBS-only samples 
        were used as control reactions. Positive samples gave a PCR product of 
        approximately 1.2 kbp. This method could detect RNA from a viral stock 
        equivalent of 9 PFU (data not shown).</p>
      <p>To confirm the identity of RT-PCR products, PCR products were gel purified 
        with QIAquick (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) columns in accordance with manufacturer’s 
        instructions. The purified DNA was sequenced with an ABI automatic sequencer 
        and the nested primers 5&acute;(2) and 3&acute;(1) and a primer based 
        on the internal sequence of the E gene of WNV (not shown).</p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Host-to-Tick Transmission</font></h4>
      <p> BALB/c mice infected with WNV were weakly viremic 2 and 3 days after 
        injection, with mean titers of 6 x 10<sup>3</sup> and 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> 
        PFU/mL<sup>-1</sup> blood respectively. After 4 days, viremia was no longer 
        detectable by plaque assay, although severe neurologic disease developed 
        in the mice after 5 or 6 days, and they were euthanized. <i>O. moubata</i> 
        ticks that had fed on mice on days corresponding to the viremic period 
        (i.e., days 2 and 3 after infection), but not those fed outside this period, 
        contained viral antigen as measured by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) 
        (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Two days after engorgement, 17% (n = 
        12) <i>I. ricinus</i> ticks that started to feed on hosts 3 days before 
        WNV injection, but not those that had started to feed 4 days after injection, 
        were positive for WNV RNA. When the former group of ticks was tested 28 
        days later, no evidence of infection was found. Infected <i>O. moubata</i> 
        ticks, in contrast, maintained the virus after molting into the next instar 
        (i.e., third instar); following a second, noninfectious bloodmeal; and 
        after molting a second time into fourth instars. Fifty percent of the 
        individual ticks (n = 14) tested by RT-PCR were positive for WNV RNA when 
        examined 132 days after the initial infectious bloodmeal.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Co-feeding Transmission</font></h4>
      <p>Five days after engorgement, 23% (n = 66) of uninfected second instar 
        O. moubata ticks that had co-fed with infected cohorts of third instar 
        ticks on noninfected mice were positive for WNV RNA (<a href="#table1">Table 
        1</a>). The remaining unfed ticks (n = 15) were tested after they had 
        molted into third instars, 45 days after co-feeding. Four of these ticks 
        (26%) were positive for WNV RNA. The identities of the PCR products obtained 
        from three positive samples were confirmed by sequence analysis.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tick-to-Host Transmission</font></h4>
      <p>Infected cohorts of <i>O. moubata</i> ticks (third instar) were fed on 
        uninfected mice to investigate tick-to-host transmission. Of the 17 uninfected 
        mice used (including mice used in co-feeding experiments), none showed 
        clinical signs of infection. One of the brains tested, from a mouse infested 
        with an infected cohort of 20 ticks, was positive by RT-PCR but negative 
        when tested by IFA (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). The PCR product was 
        sequenced to confirm the identity of WNV.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</font></h3>
      <p>Laboratory studies from the 1950s suggested that some tick species might 
        serve as competent vectors for WNV. Hurlbut and Taylor (1956) showed that 
        <i>O. savignyi</i> and <i>O. erraticus</i> ticks were infected after feeding 
        on mice inoculated with the Ar-248 strain of WNV, but transmission from 
        infected ticks to mice was not observed (<a href="#21">22,23</a>). Vermeil 
        et al. (1959) infected <i>O. maritimus</i> and <i>O. erraticus</i> ticks 
        by feeding on inoculated (Uganda 28B strain) chickens, guinea-pigs, mice, 
        or gerbils. Infected ticks transmitted the virus to uninfected mice (<a href="#21">24</a>). 
        More recently, an artificial membrane system was used to infect <i>Argas 
        arboreus</i> ticks, which were then able to transmit the virus to uninfected 
        hosts, although transstadial transmission of WNV was not observed (<a href="#21">25,26</a>).</p>
      <p>Our study demonstrated that both <i>I. ricinus</i> and <i>O. moubata</i> 
        ticks become infected with WNV (NY99 strain) through feeding on virus-infected 
        rodent hosts, but only when these hosts were viremic (i.e., systemic transmission). 
        Thirty days after engorgement, we no longer found any evidence of WNV 
        infection in the <i>I. ricinus</i> ticks. This finding suggests that nymphs 
        of this tick species do not support replication of the virus, and therefore 
        are not competent vectors for WNV. By extrapolation, the closely related 
        tick species, <i>I. scapularis</i> (the main U.S. Lyme disease vector) 
        is also unlikely to be a competent vector of WNV, although this hypothesis 
        will need to be confirmed experimentally.</p>
      <p>In contrast, infected <i>O. moubata</i> ticks maintained infectious virus 
        for at least 132 days (length of experiment), and WNV persisted transstadially 
        through at least two developmental stages. Evidence for tick-to-host transmission 
        of WNV was found in our study, although the level of infection observed 
        (subclinical) makes assessing its importance without further investigation 
        difficult. Whitman and Aitken (1960) observed much higher levels of transmission 
        from WNV-infected (Eg101 strain) <i>O. moubata</i> ticks to day-old chicks 
        but only when very high feeding densities were used (an average of 49 
        ticks per chick) (<a href="#11">16</a>). Although ticks often feed in 
        large numbers on individual hosts (<a href="#21">27</a>), tick-to-host 
        transmission appears to be very inefficient when compared to mosquito 
        transmission of WNV (<a href="#21">23</a>). Consequently, this mode of 
        transmission is unlikely to be important in the natural transmission cycle 
        of WNV. Perhaps higher levels of infection (and therefore transmission) 
        would be found with ticks that feed on birds, the natural reservoir hosts 
        of WNV. Some avian species exhibit much higher (&gt;10<sup>10</sup> PFU/mL 
        serum) and more prolonged viremia when infected with WNV than the mice 
        used for this investigation (<a href="#21">28,29</a>). Although neither 
        of the tick species that we tested are obligate bird feeders, <i>I. ricinus</i> 
        ticks often feed on pheasants in the United Kingdom (<a href="#21">30</a>), 
        and several species of <i>Ornithodoros</i> ticks feed almost exclusively 
        on birds, for example, the <i>O. capensis</i> group of ticks that are 
        established along the southern coast of the United States (<a href="#31">31</a>). 
        As members of this group have been shown to be competent vectors for WNV 
        (<a href="#21">24</a>), these ticks could represent a reservoir of the 
        virus in the United States.</p>
      <p>The transmission of flaviviruses such as TBEV and LIV from infected to 
        noninfected ixodid ticks through co-feeding on nonviremic hosts (nonsystemic 
        transmission) is a well-established phenomenon (<a href="#31">32</a>). 
        Indeed, this mode of transmission is believed to play a substantial role 
        in the epidemiology of these diseases (<a href="#21">27</a>). We tested 
        for co-feeding transmission of WNV between infected and uninfected <i>O. 
        moubata</i> ticks. More than 22% of the uninfected ticks were positive 
        for WNV RNA 5 days after co-feeding. A similar percentage of ticks were 
        positive 40 days later, after having molted to the next developmental 
        stage. As co-fed ticks were in contact with the mice for &lt;24 hours, 
        this finding strongly suggests that WNV was nonsystemically transmitted 
        between infected and uninfected ticks, since viremia had insufficient 
        time to develop. Our study represents the first unequivocal report of 
        co-feeding transmission by an argasid tick species. Argasid ticks, unlike 
        ixodid ticks, typically feed for <u>&lt;</u>2 hours. Vesicular stomatitis 
        virus has been transmitted between infected and noninfected co-feeding 
        black flies (<i>Simulium vittatum</i>), insects that typically feed for 
        4–5 min (<a href="#31">33</a>). Langerhans cells are believed to be the 
        agents of viral transmission between feeding sites of infected and noninfected 
        co-feeding hard ticks (<a href="#31">32,34</a>). Langerhans cells, which 
        are susceptible to WNV infection (<a href="#31">35</a>), have been shown 
        to migrate rapidly (within 2 hours) from localized antigen-stimulated 
        epidermal sites (<a href="#31">36</a>). Therefore, these cells could possibly 
        play a similar role in the co-feeding transmission of WNV by soft tick 
        species.</p>
      <p>Although this study is not exhaustive, it does demonstrate that tick 
        species can become infected with the U.S. strain of WNV through feeding 
        upon infected hosts and through co-feeding with infected ticks on noninfected 
        hosts. In some tick species, WNV can be maintained through the transstadial 
        stages of the tick lifecycle, and infected ticks may be capable of infecting 
        hosts through further feeding. When compared to experimental studies with 
        mosquito species (<a href="#31">37–39</a>), ticks are clearly not efficient 
        vectors of WNV and therefore are unlikely to be important vectors for 
        WNV in the current U.S. epidemic. However, our results demonstrate that 
        WNV can persist for a comparatively long time in infected ticks and be 
        transmitted between vertebrate hosts; this finding suggests a reservoir 
        potential of ticks for WNV that justifies further investigation.</p>
