              Lampreys  were first discovered in Lake Ontario in 1835, Lake Erie in 1921, Lake  Michigan in 1936, Lake Huron in 1937, and Lake Superior in 1946  (Applegate 1950; Lawrie 1970; Smith 1979; Smith and Tibbles 1980; Smith  1985). Its distribution in all five Great Lakes and selected  tributaries includes the states <b>Illinois</b> (Smith 1979; Emery 1985); <b>Indiana</b> (Gerking 1955; Emery 1985); <b>Michigan</b> (Applegate 1950; Smith 1979; <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Cudmore-Vokey and Crossman 2000</span>); <b>Minnesota</b> (Eddy and Underhill 1974; Phillips <em>et al</em>. 1982; Emery 1985); <b>New York</b> (Smith 1985); <b>Ohio</b> (Trautman 1981; Emery 1985; USFWS 2005); <b>Pennsylvania</b> (Emery 1985); and <b>Wisconsin</b> (Becker 1983; Emery 1985).  This species is also present in Apostle Islands  National Lakeshore, Wisconsin; Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore,  Indiana; Isle Royale National Park, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore,  and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan (Tilmant 1999);  and Walnut Creek, Pennsylvania (Phillips&nbsp;et al. 2003).<br /><br />This species was formerly believed to be introduced into the Finger  Lakes and Lake Champlain in &nbsp;New York and Vermont (Lee et al. 1980 et  seq.).&nbsp; However recent genetic evidence shows it is native to these  areas (Bryan et al. 2005).<br />                



<P><B>Means of Introduction:</B> 
                Controversy  exists as to whether the sea lamprey is native to Lake Ontario. Several  believe it is native (e.g., Lawrie 1970; Smith 1985), suggesting that  sea lampreys found in Lake Ontario and its tributaries, the Finger  Lakes, and Lake Champlain represent relict populations from the last  Pleistocene glaciation. Those contending that it is not native believe  that this species, unknown in Lake Ontario prior to the 1830s, had most  likely entered the inland lake from Atlantic coastal drainages via the  artificially created Erie Canal (e.g., Emery 1985). Whether or not the  sea lamprey is native to Lake Ontario, this species is not native to  the other Great Lakes and tributaries where it is now readily found.  The sea lamprey was previously prevented from spreading into Lake Erie  and the rest of the Great Lakes basin by Niagara Falls. The Welland  Canal, opened in 1829, bypassed Niagara Falls providing a route to Lake  Erie from Lake Ontario (Aron and Smith 1971). From the opening of the  Welland Canal (1829) to the discovery of sea lamprey in Lake Erie  (1921), there is almost a century difference. Yet sea lampreys were  found throughout the Great Lakes to the farthest Great Lake, Lake  Superior, within twenty-five years of their arrival to Lake Erie. The  improvements done to the Welland Canal in 1919 are likely the change  that facilitated sea lamprey immigration into Lake Erie (1921) (Great  Lakes Fishery Commission, on-line resource).&nbsp;                      

<P><B>Status:</B> 
                Established  throughout the Great Lakes region. This species was common in lakes  Michigan and Huron by the 1930s and in eastern Lake Superior by the  1940s; it never became very abundant in Lake Ontario (Applegate 1950;  Emery 1985) or Lake Erie (Smith 1985).                      

<P><B>Impact of Introduction: </B>
                Attack and parasitic  feeding on other fishes by adult lampreys often results in death of the  prey, either directly from the loss of fluids and tissues or indirectly  from secondary infection of the wound (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 1982).  Of the fish that survived attacks by lampreys, 85% of various species  had been attacked up to five times (Scott and Crossman 1973). The  species' introduction to the Great Lakes and its later abundance,  combined with water pollution and overfishing, resulted in the decline  of several large native species, including several ciscoes <i>Coregonus</i> spp., lake trout <i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>, and walleye <i>Stizostedion vitreum</i>,  among others. Consequently, there was a collapse in the commercial  fisheries during the 1940s and 1950s in many parts of the Great Lakes,  particularly in lakes Huron and Michigan, and in eastern Lake Superior  (e.g., Lawrie 1970; Scott and Crossman 1973; Christie 1974; Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980 <em>et seq</em>.;  Smith and Tibbles 1980; Becker 1983; Emery 1985; Courtenay 1993). Lake  trout catch in Lake Huron fell from 3.4 million pounds in 1937 to  virtual failure in 1947. In Lake Michigan, U.S. catch fell from 5.5  million pounds in 1946 to 402 pounds in 1953. In Lake Superior, catch  dropped from an average of 4.5 million pounds to 368 thousand pounds in  1961 (Scott and Crossman 1973). In freshwater, sea lampreys are also known to attack white sucker <i>Catostomus commersoni</i>, longnose sucker <i>Catostomus catostomus</i>, redhorse <i>Moxostoma</i> spp., yellow perch <i>Perca flavescens</i>, rainbow trout <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>, burbot <i>Lota lota</i>, channel catfish <i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>, northern pike <i>Esox lucius</i>, and common carp <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>  (Scott and Crossman 1973). Sea lamprey predation, in combination with  other factors (i.e., overfishing and hybridization with more common  cisco species), led to the extinction of three endemics in the Great  Lakes; the longjaw cisco <i>Coregonus alpenae</i>, the deepwater cisco <i>C. johannae</i>, and the blackfin cisco <i>C. nigripinnis</i> (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1989). During the late 1940s, the alewife <i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>  invaded the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean. Because the sea  lamprey had greatly reduced the population of large predators, alewife  populations exploded and were followed by tremendous die-offs,  resulting in additional changes to fish species composition in the  lakes (Smith and Tibbles 1980). Sea lampreys also took a toll on the  introduced salmon in the Great Lakes, much to the dismay of anglers and  state fish agencies. Although the number of sea lamprey in the Great  Lakes has been reduced, they still kill substantial numbers of lake  trout in some areas and thus are impeding the rebuilding of established  populations (Schneider <em>et al</em>. 1996, and references therein).                      

<P><B>Remarks:</B> 
                Early methods to control  this species included mechanical weirs and electrical barriers (Scott  and Crossman 1973; Smith and Tibbles 1980). Beginning in the late  1950s, sea lampreys began to be successfully controlled by use of the  lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), a chemical agent that  kills larval lampreys in their stream habitats (Smith and Tibbles  1980). The lampricide has reduced the population by over 90% of the  1961 peak (Scott and Crossman 1973). As a result, commercial fisheries  reportedly have shown some recovery (Smith 1985; Page and Laird 1993)  and the sea lamprey's impact on native fishes has been reduced (Page  and Laird 1993). However, continued use of TFM is apparently required  to keep sea lamprey populations under control (Scott and Crossman 1973;  Becker 1983). TFM is sometimes harmful to other fish (e.g., walleye)  (Becker 1983), as well as to the larvae of nonparasitic lamprey  species. <br /><br />Results of an international symposium on the sea lamprey were  published in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in  1980. The demise of lake trout led to development of the splake, a  hybrid between lake trout and brook trout. It was hoped that the hybrid  would better avoid lampreys and mature faster, hence spawn at least  once before becoming parasitized (Scott and Crossman 1973). <br /><br />As of 1991,  it was estimated that the U.S. and Canada were spending $8 million per  year on lamprey control and another $12 million per year on lake trout  restoration (Newman 1991). The  Sea Lamprey is one of the most important invasive species in the Great  Lakes. Although perhaps the first invader to the Great Lakes, having  migrated out of Lake Ontario in the 1830's and into the other Great  Lakes through the Welland Canal, it was not until the 1950's that  impacts on fisheries were so great as to prompt serious management  efforts. It was then that the Great Lakes Fisheries Investigations, the  progenitor of the present day USGS Great Lakes Science Center in Ann  Arbor was charged with discovering a lampricide targeting the larval  stage. The Great Lakes Fisheries Commission was also formed at this  time, an organization primarily concerned with Sea Lamprey management.  Successful application of lampricide ensued, reducing the Lamprey  population dramatically.However,  decimation by Sea Lamprey of predatory fish representing the top  trophic levels of the Great Lakes food web had already caused another  invader, the Alewife, to proliferate. The Alewife population exploded,  causing fish kills that washed up on shore. Thus the Sea Lamprey  created the need to control Alewife. Due also tothe decimation of native  predatory fish populations by sea lamprey, a Great Lakes sport fishery  was created with the stocking of Chinook Salmon in the 1960's.<br /><br />
