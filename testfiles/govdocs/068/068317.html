<P>The Hale Solar Laboratory is a T-shaped reinforced concrete structure
of Spanish Colonial Revival design with a chimney, mission tiles, rough
plastered walls, and deep set windows. The building is set back on a
rectangular lot on Holladay Road, behind a plastered wall, in Pasadena,
California. [<A HREF="#1">1</A>]</P>

<P>Designed in 1924 by the architectural firm of Johnson, Kaufman, and
Coate, of Pasadena, California, the Laboratory's dimensions are 21 feet
x 49 feet with two sections: the observatory and telescope, and the
library and living room. The third wing, which forms the "T" is below
grade and contains dynamos, transformers, and the heating and
ventilating plant. There are six rooms in all, built for $14,000.</P>

<P>The portion of the building facing Holladay Road has two sections.
The northern portion has a gabled, tiled roof, the gable end facing
north. A chimney interrupts this roof line on the east. Two deep set
plain windows pierce the roughly plastered wall. Each window has a
smaller rectangular tile inset near the roof line. The second section
facing Holladay Road is the telescope tower, 21 feet square with a domed
top 14 feet in diameter and rising 30 feet from ground level. A long
rectangular window similar to those in the adjacent portion of the
building can be found with a blue tiled inset within a quatrefoil recess
set closer to the roof line. The roof is flat with a parapet wall 2.5
feet high. In the center of the tower, descending from the spectrograph
room in the basement, is a well 10 feet in diameter and 78.5 feet
deep.</P>

<P>Facing to the south in the tower is the front door. This arched
entrance is approximately 15 feet tall. Set into the upper portion of
the arch are astronomical details including the sun and its rays.
Because of Hale's interest in Egyptology, he commissioned the well known
sculptor, Lee Lawrie, to create two bas-reliefs. The cast stone
bas-relief over the doorway is a tribute to Akhnaton (the King of Egypt
and worshipper of the sun god, Aton) symbolized by the sun's rays that
end in the hands that grasp the symbol of life--a copy from a Theban
tomb. Another bas-relief by Lawrie is positioned over the fireplace in
the library. Many scientific journals and books belonging to George
Ellery Hale remain in the basement.</P>

<P>The sycamore trees flanking the entrance, the loquat trees, and the
arbutus that surround the Hale Solar Laboratory were planted in 1928.
The design for the landscaping was done by Beatrix Farrand, who also
designed the grounds, the parking court with its dwarf myrtis hedge and
sour citrus trees and the drive which centers on the dome.</P>

<P>The observatory is at the end of a long driveway which is lined with
mature plants. The street facing facade is no longer visible, but the
path leading to the entrance remains intact. The 1924 annual report from
Mount Wilson describes the lot as 95 feet x 300 feet--the same lot size
as today, suggesting the plantings and design could be original. There
is an outbuilding at the northeast corner of the lot. The long asphalt
central driveway terminates at a large open motor court just beyond the
metal gates in the plastered masonry wall across the width of the
property from north to south. The driveway is located on the east-west
axis of the observatory portion of the building.</P>

<P>The exterior of the basement is surrounded by a light moat. Stairs
with an iron railing lead from the northern facade to the moat, which
surrounds all of the building except that portion which is part of the
telescope tower. An arched window is in the northern facade. The east
and west walls of the structure are mirror images, except for the
chimney on the eastern wall.</P>

<P>The telescope tower has 45&deg; clipped corners and the tower portion
has overflows for roof drainage.</P>

<P>The Hale Solar Laboratory has not been altered since its construction
in 1924. The building is in excellent condition and retains much of the
original equipment and personal books and journals used by George Ellery
Hale.</P>

<P><BR><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099"><B>SUMMARY</B></FONT><HR
NOSHADE></P>

<P>The Hale Solar Laboratory is significant because of its association
with its owner-builder, George Ellery Hale. Hale was an internationally
famous scientist, a trustee behind the endowment of the Huntington
Library and Art Gallery in San Marino, California, and a trustee and
organizer of the California Institute of Technology.</P>

<P>The Hale Solar Laboratory was Hale's office and workshop for the
later years of his life. Hale's scientific contributions were many,
especially in the area of astronomy. Hale was one of the first
scientists to compare observations in physics laboratories here on earth
to what is seen in the heavens. He, more than anyone else, is the person
most responsible for the rise of the science of modern astrophysics in
the United States.</P>

<P>The Hale Solar Laboratory is also significant as the site of many
scientific discoveries, the most famous being Hale's refinement of the
spectrohelioscope, a device that made it possible to observe the
hydrogen-rich prominences of the sun.</P>

<P><BR><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099"><B>HISTORY</B></FONT><HR
NOSHADE></P>

<P>George Ellery Hale was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 29, 1868.
Hale graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890
and after some work in Europe, organized the Kenwood Observatory in
Chicago. There in 1889 he invented the spectroheliograph, a device that
made it possible to photograph the light of a single spectral line of
the sun. Thus he was able to photograph the sun by the light of glowing
calcium, and the result was a clear indication of the distribution of
calcium in the solar atmosphere. Hale detected calcium clouds in the Sun
that he called flocculi. [<A HREF="#2">2</A>]</P>

<P>To continue his research Hale felt the need for larger and more
sophisticated telescopes. This led to Hale's greatest
accomplishments--organizing and carrying out projects involving the
construction of astronomical observatories. During the course of his
career, Hale was responsible for the founding of three major
observatories Yerkes in Wisconsin, and Mount Wilson and Palomar in
California. He built the world's largest telescopes many times over.</P>

<P>Hale began work on his first large observatory in 1892 when he
persuaded Chicago street-car magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes to support the
establishment of a large astronomical observatory for the University of
Chicago. Hale had Alvan G. Clark begin the process of grinding and
polishing the glass disks for the proposed 40-inch refractor. Yerkes
Observatory was completed in 1897, and its 40-inch refractor remains the
largest refractor in the world today. Generations of astronomers have
been trained or worked at Yerkes, in the past century making use of the
fortunate combination of Yerkes' money and Hale's vision.</P>

<P>Hale was not satisfied and soon left Yerkes to travel to California
in pursuit of newer and more powerful telescopes. In 1904 he founded the
Mount Wilson Observatory, obtaining the funding from steel magnate
Andrew Carnegie. A 60-inch reflecting telescope was placed in operation
there in 1908 and a 100-inch reflecting telescope was placed in
operation in 1917 the latter paid for by the Los Angeles hardware
tycoon, John D. Hooker. [<A HREF="#3">3</A>]</P>

<P>The 100-inch was to remain the largest telescope in the world for a
generation. By using this telescope, astronomers at Mount Wilson in 1930
first observed velocities of galaxies increase progressively with
ever-increasing distances from the earth. This observation, combined
with an earlier observation made on this telescope in 1924 that galaxies
are stellar systems, clarified one of the most basic questions of
cosmology--the nature of the large scale structure of the universe. [<A
HREF="#4">4</A>]</P>

<P>It was at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1908 that George Ellery
Hale made his most famous scientific discovery when he detected the
existence of strong magnetic fields inside sunspots. This was the first
association of magnetic fields with any extraterrestrial body. [<A
HREF="#5">5</A>]</P>

<P>Hale's activities reached into many fields during this time. With
colleagues Alfred Noyes and Robert Millikan, he transformed the Throop
Polytechnic Institute into the California Institute of Technology. He
persuaded Henry E. Huntington to endow the Huntington Library and Art
Gallery. As a member of the Pasadena Planning Commission he was
influential in obtaining for Pasadena the coordinated civic center
buildings--City Hall, Civic Auditorium, and Central Library. For this
work he received the Noble medal from the City of Pasadena, an award set
aside for out standing local citizens.</P>

<P> Some of his other contributions are less well known. He co-founded
the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the <U>Astrophysical
Journal</U>. He persuaded President Woodrow Wilson to form the National
Research Council, through which scientific minds could be best used to
help the country during World War I. Hale worked with Bertram Goodhue on
the plans of the building designed in 1924 for the Research Council in
Washington, DC.</P>

<P> After retiring from the active directorship of the Mount Wilson
Observatory in 1923 Hale searched for a site for a new observatory--one
where he could work undisturbed. Hale investigated observing conditions
around Pasadena and found that the "seeing" was actually better in the
valley than on Mount Wilson during the middle part of the day. A 95 x
300 foot lot was purchased from the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art
Gallery near the southern border of Pasadena.</P>

<P>Construction began in 1924. The building permit application, dated
April 18, 1924, lists the architect as Johnson, Kaufman, &amp; Coate,
one of the more prominent firms in Pasadena. The reinforced concrete
structure was built under the supervision of George Jones of the Mount
Wilson Observatory staff. The 21 x 49 foot building included a dome
housing equipment for viewing the sun (with a 78 foot pit below ground),
a library, and a basement with shop and lab.</P>

<P> The project was financed largely by George Ellery Hale personally,
although construction and some of the equipment were provided by
Carnegie Institution. Upon completion in 1925 Hale made a gift of the
buildings, grounds, and equipment to the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. The Solar Lab was to become a permanent branch of the Mount
Wilson Observatory.</P>

<P>Hale spent his retirement years at his lab studying the sun with
instruments of his design. He installed a spectroheliograph at the lab,
a device to photograph the sun using the light of a single wavelength.
Hale had won the Janssen Gold Medal of the Paris Academy of Science in
1894 for this invention. While at the lab, Hale redesigned the
spectroheliograph, to allow the sun to be seen by hydrogen light. Hale's
new instrument, called the spectrohelioscope, showed up the prominences
of the sun in greater detail than ever before observed. In his spare
time he wrote several books, while also completing plans for the
200-inch telescope at Palomar Mountain.</P>

<P>After Hale's death in 1938 the Hale Solar Laboratory continued to be
used as a solar observatory for many years. It was at the Hale Solar
Laboratory in 1952 that Mount Wilson astronomers Harold and Horace
Babcock (father and son) constructed the first solar magnetograph. This
instrument finally enabled astronomers to measure the general magnetic
field of the sun, a goal which had long been sought after by Hale. In
1985 the Hale Solar Laboratory was sold to William and Christine
Shirley, who built a private residence on the grounds. The laboratory
currently houses the offices of the Mount Wilson Institute, a non-profit
organization, formed in 1986 to operate the Mount Wilson Observatory
when the Carnegie Institution of Washington announced plans to withdraw
from the Observatory.</P>
