  Description:
    Abstract: 
      This data set portrays the occurrence of butterflies in
      counties in the United States.  Butterfly occurrence data
      are cumulative, so positive occurrence data do not
      necessarily imply current residence of the species.  Most
      records are from the last 30 to 40 years, with a few
      records that date from as early as the late 1800's.
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for use in publications at a scale
      of 1:2,000,000 or smaller.  Due to the small scale, the
      primary use is for regional and national data display and
      analysis, rather than specific local data analysis.  No
      responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in
      the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information: 
      This data set must be used together with the dBASE IV file
      bflyspt.dbf.  Bflyspt.dbf describes the butterfly species
      to which this occurrence data applies.

  Data_Set_Credit: 
    The following people and organizations contributed to the
    original data set compiled by the Northern Prairie Wildlife
    Research Center (NPWRC).  Contributors are listed by project.

    Butterflies of the Eastern United States (Opler): Museum
    collections surveyed by the compiler were the National Museum
    of Natural History (Washington, D.C.); Frost Museum,
    Pennsylvania State University; and the E. O. Essig Museum,
    University of California at Berkeley.  Other State
    institutional collections were surveyed by contributors.

    The contributors should receive most of the credit for the
    many days afield and the many hours spent compiling records.
    The names of the many collectors or naturalists who provided
    data to State compilers or for recently published State
    treatments are not all included, but their contributions were
    crucial of course.  Dr. John M. Burns (USNM), Dr. K.C. Kim
    (Frost Museum), and Dr. J.A.  Powell (Essig Museum) kindly
    allowed the NPWRC compiler to examine collections under their
    care.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided logistic
    support.  All work by the compiler was carried out during
    non-duty hours.

    Butterflies of Western USA and Northern Mexico (Stanford and 
    Opler): NPWRC received data from over 320 individuals,
    reviewed over 300 books and scientific papers, and examined
    material in nearly every public and private collection in
    western North America and a few major Eastern ones (see next
    paragraph).  This research will continue.  The following list
    includes only those who contributed over 10 data points, and
    major publication authors.  The NPWRC thanks all

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      All records in the original files were checked by a
      qualified lepidopterist before inclusion.  Both compilation
      and checking were performed manually and there is a
      possibility that some errors may remain.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Not applicable

  Completeness_Report: 
    This data file includes information for all counties in the
    United States where population information is available.  A
    species is reported as present in a county if there is a
    specimen in an institutional or private collection, or a
    reliable literature record such as a citation in an original
    description, a monograph, or a State compilation.  Records
    may represent either resident or stray status.  Lack of data
    for a county indicates that no records exist, rather than
    that no species are present.  This data is cumulative, so a
    positive record does not necessarily imply current residence
    of the species.

      Process_Description:
        The original occurrence file (Bflytab) was compiled by
        the Biological Resources Division from multiple sources, 
        including U.S. museums, State University collections,
        reliable literature publications, scientific literature,
        private collections, and information provided by State
        and regional coordinators.  Most records are specimen
        based, although some sightings of easily identified
        species were accepted.

        The Species listing (bflyspec) was compiled by the
        Biological Resources Division.  All naming is based on
        the most recent North American Butterfly Association
        standards and some changes introduced in Layberry et al,
        1998, Butterflies of Canada, University of Toronto Press.

        The two source files were received as ASCII delimited
        text files.  These files were read into WordPerfect and
        edited to delete extra characters, and to add column
        headings.  The resulting files were loaded into ArcView
        as text, then saved as .dbf files.  Bflytab was edited in
        ArcView to convert the FIPS codes from integer to 
        character, and to add leading zeros to those FIPS codes
        that were only 4 digits.  Both files were then saved in
        ArcView as .dbf files.

        In the online, interactive National Atlas of the United
        States, the occurrence file is joined to the county
        boundaries for display purposes, and the occurrence file
        and the species listing are linked via a Structured Query
        Language statement in Microsoft Access.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Specie#
      Attribute_Definition: 
        The Species number where # is a number from 1 to 789. 
        The species numbers represent butterfly species, which
        are identified by Species name, Family, Subfamily, and
        Common name in bflyspt.dbf.  The species number in
        butflyt.dbf corresponds to the number listed under Column
        in the bflyspt.dbf file.  For example, the Specie3 field
        contains occurrence data for Achalarus casica (Common
        name: Desert Cloudywing) butterflies.
