Dear Colleague:

The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), U.S. Department of Justice, is pleased to present the OVC
National Resource Directory of Victim Assistance Funding Opportunities 2000. The directory lists, by
State and Territory, the contact names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses for the
Federal grant programs that provide assistance to crime victims, including
  
                    Victims of Crime Act (VOCA).
  
                    Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
  
                    Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance (Byrne).
  
                    Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG).
  
                    Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA).
  
                    Children's Justice Act (CJA) State and Tribal Grant Programs.
  
                    State Victim Service Grant Programs.    

In addition, many State governments allocate State funding to assist victims of crime. If a State does
allocate such funding, and the administrator responded to OVC's survey by providing contact information,
the directory will include the State agency and the contact person.

We sincerely hope this directory is useful to State and local organizations that are interested in applying for
State or Federal funding to support crime victim assistance programs. We also hope this Directory will
make it easier for Federal and State victim assistance grant administrators to locate each other and
communicate. The directory is published annually to provide you up-to-date information. The directory
(NCJ# 181042) is available through OVC's Resource Center and Web site. See the contact information
below.
  
With best wishes,
                         
                                             Kathryn M. Turman                            and            Carol R. Watkins

			                          Introduction

The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) developed the OVC National Resource Directory of Victim
Assistance Funding Opportunities 2000 in response to requests from State and local crime victim
service providers for easy-to-access information about funding opportunities and contacts. The
directory also provides a complete listing of  professional colleagues nationwide for State victim
assistance program administrators.

Although this directory is not an exhaustive listing of funding opportunities for victims, OVC plans
to keep gathering data and expanding this resource. To help us expand this directory,  OVC
encourages you to make note of resources that should be included in future editions. For your
convenience, a "new information" form has been included at the back of the "Quick Look" section
of the directory. In time, with your feedback, the directory will evolve and expand as OVC
continues to compile information about funding sources for crime victim services.  
     
The funding resources profiled in this directory come from several Federal grant programs,
including the following:

  1.  The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Formula Grant
  Program (Byrne Program). Administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice
  Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance.  

  In 1968, Congress enacted legislation that provided funds for local crime control efforts in
  States and Territories. This legislation, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act,
  established certain precepts: 1) Criminal justice is an integrated system; 2) Reduction of crime
  requires planning and evaluation of activities; 3) Citizens must participate in crime reduction
  efforts; 4) Victims' needs must be considered; and 5) government at all levels and disciplines
  must work together to achieve common goals.  

  In 1988, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which authorizes population-based grants
  to States. The States in turn subgrant the funds to State agencies, local governments, and other
  entities. The purpose of the Byrne Program is to help State agencies and local governments
  initiate innovative projects to reduce drug use and violent crime and to improve the
  effectiveness of the criminal justice system. The Byrne Program authorizes States to allocate
  funds to projects that advance this overall strategy.

  For more information on the Byrne Program, please contact the Bureau of Justice Assistance at
  (202) 514-6638.

  2.  Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA). Administered by the U.S. Department
  of  Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families.

  The purpose of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act includes several elements: 1)
  to help States increase public awareness about family violence, to prevent family violence, and
  to provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their
  dependents; and 2) to provide technical assistance and training related to family violence
  programs to States and local public agencies, including law enforcement agencies; courts; legal
  services; social services; health care professionals; and nonprofit, private organizations.

    For more information on the FVPSA program, please contact DHHS, Administration for
  Children and Families at (202) 401-5529.

  3.  The Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG). Administered by the U.S.
  Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

  For Federal fiscal year 2000, Congress appropriated $45,000,000 for rape prevention and
  education. Congress mandated that at least 25 percent of the PHHSBG grant funds be devoted
  to education programs for middle and high school students. The remainder of the funds must
  be used by States to support direct services that offer hotline support and victim counseling,
  such as rape crisis centers. In addition, this grant can be used for several other purposes,
  including increasing public awareness through training programs for professionals such as
  police officers and investigators; preparing informational materials; and promoting other public
  education efforts organized by State sexual assault coalitions and victim advocates. 

  For more information about the PHHSBG program, contact The Family and Intimate Violence
  Prevention Team, Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injuries Prevention and
  Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (770) 488-4410.

  4.  STOP Violence Against Women Act Program (VAWA). Administered by the U.S. Department
  of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Violence Against Women Grant Office. The 1994
  Violence Against Women Act established four grant programs:  

     a)        STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program. This program provides grants
     for States, Territories, and the District of Columbia to develop and implement effective
     law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women and
     to develop and enhance victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women. 

     To carry out programs and projects specified in the Violence Against Women Act, funds
     granted to qualified States may be further subgranted by the State to agencies and
     programs including, but not limited to, the following: State offices and agencies; public
     and nonprofit organizations; units of local government; Indian Tribal governments;
     nonprofit, nongovernmental victim services programs; and legal services programs. Each
     State must allocate 25 percent of the STOP funds it receives to law enforcement, 25
     percent to prosecution, and 25 percent to nonprofit, nongovernmental victim services. The
     remaining 25 percent may be allocated at the State's discretion within the parameters of
     the Act.

     b)        STOP Violence Against Indian Women Discretionary Grants Program. This program
     establishes that 4 percent of the amount appropriated each year for the STOP VAWA
     Formula Grant Program be allocated for grants to Indian Tribal governments to develop
     and to strengthen the Tribal justice system's response to violent crimes against Indian
     women. To ensure development of a coordinated approach, the STOP Violence Against
     Women Act requires that Tribal governments with law enforcement and prosecution
     components allocate at least 25 percent of the program's funds respectively to law
     enforcement; prosecution; and nonprofit, nongovernmental victim services programs.

     c)        Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program. This
     program focuses on the needs and unique characteristics of rural communities in
     addressing domestic violence and child victimization. The program addresses these issues
     in appropriate, collaborative ways that improve and increase the services available to
     women and children while enhancing community involvement in developing a
     jurisdictional response to domestic violence and child victimization.

     d)        Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies. This program focuses on the development and
     implementation of laws, policies, and protocols that encourage or mandate the arrest of
     domestic violence offenders based on probable cause that an offense has been committed
     or when the terms of a valid, outstanding protection order have been violated. To ensure
     victim safety and perpetrator accountability in domestic violence cases, the program
     promotes aggressive, system-wide coordination throughout the criminal justice system and
     the nonprofit, nongovernmental victim service agencies.

 Programs at (202) 307-6026.

 5. Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). Administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice
 Programs, Office for Victims of Crime. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 created a repository of
 fines, fees, and bond forfeitures from convicted Federal offenders. These monies are to be used
 for crime victims. Through the following programs, funds are made available to States and
 Territories for crime victims and their service providers:
  
    a)        VOCA victim compensation provides reimbursement for medical and mental health costs,
    funeral expenses, and lost wages. States and Territories must also provide compensation to
    residents who are victims of terrorist acts and mass violence within or outside the United
    States. Compensation is paid only when other financial resources, such as private insurance
    or offender restitution, do not cover the loss. Federal and State regulations apply.   

    b)        All States and Territories receive an annual VOCA victim assistance formula grant. VOCA
    authorizes States and Territories to subgrant VOCA funds to agencies and nonprofit
    organizations the States and Territories believe will best meet the unique needs of crime
    victims in that community.

    VOCA contains three original priority areas for State distribution of victim assistance funds:
    child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. Additionally, States must award funds to
    support services to underserved crime victims such as survivors of the victims of DWI/DUI
    crashes, survivors of victims of homicide, assault victims, adults molested as children, elder
    abuse victims, robbery victims, and other violent crime victims.  

    States establish their own victim assistance grant application process according to guidelines
    developed by OVC. States have maximum discretion to set priorities, establish policies and
    procedures, identify the services and programs to be funded within the State, and determine
    the conditions for continued funding. States also assess crime victims' needs statewide,
    target resources to those areas, and train advocates to improve services for crime victims.

    c)        Children's Justice Act Tribal Grant Program. Since 1989, the Federal Crime Victims
    Division of OVC has provided funding through the Children's Justice Act Partnerships for
    Indian Communities. These funds are used to help American Indian Tribes develop,
    establish, and operate programs to improve the investigation, prosecution, and handling of
    child abuse cases, particularly sexual abuse cases, so that these are conducted in a manner
    that limits additional trauma to the child victim.

 For more information on the Crime Victims Compensation, Crime Victim Assistance, and the
 CJA Tribal Grant Programs, please contact the Office for Victims of Crime at (202) 307-5983.

 6.  The Children's Justice and Assistance Act (CJA). The Children's Justice and Assistance Act
 amended the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). CJA authorizes grants to States to improve the
 investigation and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases, particularly child sexual abuse
 and exploitation cases, and the handling of child fatality cases in which child abuse or neglect is
 suspected. CJA directs that such cases be handled in a manner that limits additional trauma to
 the child victim.

 For more information on the Children's Justice and Assistance Act Grant Program, please contact
 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Children and Families,
 Children's Bureau at 202/205-8076.

 7.  State and Territorial Victim Service Grant Programs.  How does information get into this
 directory? If a State government allocates State funding to assist crime victims, and if an
 Administrator responded to OVC's survey, then this directory lists the award-making agency and
 the contact person. If information about your State is missing or incorrect, help OVC update the
 directory--complete the "new information" form at the back of the "Quick Look" section of the
 directory and return it to OVC. 

 With your help, future editions of OVC's National Resource Directory of  Victim Assistance
 Funding Opportunities 2000  will provide even more comprehensive information about funding
 opportunities available to victim service providers.
