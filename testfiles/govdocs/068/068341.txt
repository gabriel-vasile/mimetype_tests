 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 Children  Now,  in  association  with  the  national  coalition  People  for  Better  TV, 
 hereby  submit  the  following  comments  in  response  to  the  Notice  ofInquiry  (hereinafter, 
 “Notice”)  in  the  above-  captioned  proceeding  that  was  released  on  December  20,  1999. 
 Children  Now  commends  the  Commission  for  opening  this  inquiry  into  the  public  interest 
 obligations  of  television  broadcast  licensees  as  the  revolutionary  transition  from  analog  to 
 digital  television  (“  DTV”)  technology  begins.  The  implications  of  this  transition  and  its 
 effects  on  the  American  public,  particularly  America’s  children,  are  unprecedented. 
 These  comments  will  begin  by  exploring  the  particular  importance  of  children’s 
 issues  for  this  FCC  inquiry,  the  Advisory  Committee’s  recommendations  regarding 
 children’s  programming  in  the  digital  era,  and  the  specific  FCC  requests  that  we  will 
 address.  The  second  section  will  examine  the  DTV  technological  advances  that  will 
 impact  children  most  significantly  during  the  transitional  period.  The  third  section  will 
 assess  the  Children’s  Television  Act  of  1990  and  its  impact  on  current  programming. 
 Finally,  we  present  a  set  of  recommendations  regarding  areas  of  DTV  broadcasting  that 
 will  affect  children.  These  recommendations  are  starting  points  for  further  research  and 
 analysis,  and  should  be  considered  for  future  rule-  making.  Children  Now  joins  People 
 for  Better  TV  in  their  request  for  a  rule-  making  proceeding  and  hearings  to  determine 
 specifically  the  public  interest  obligations  of  digital  broadcasters.  ’ 
 These  comments  benefit  from  a  series  of  discussions  that  Children  Now  has 


 undertaken  since  the  beginning  of  2000.  This  series  includes  conversations  with  leading 
 academics,  advocates,  and  industry  professionals,  regarding  their  general  opinions  of 
3
 Children  Now  2 
 DTV  public  interest  obligations  and  children.*  We  will  continue  this  important  process 
 with  a  formalized  schedule  of  interviews  and  meetings  throughout  the  rule-  making 
 process  to  obtain  the  highest  level  of  relevant  expertise. 
 A.  The  State  of  the  Nation’s  Children 
 Officials  recognize  that  the  meaning  of  the  public  interest  will  change  -  indeed,  must  change  -  in  a  new  communications  environment  in  which  viewers  rather  than 
 programmers  choose  what  to  watch  and  when,  and  in  which  viewers  may  one  day  even  produce  and  distribute  programs  themselves.  There  are  few  firm  points  of  agreement  on 
 how  this  new  communications  environment  should  be  structured  or  whom  it  should  serve  .  .  .  But  everyone  everywhere  can  agree  on  one  precept:  the  public  interest  requires  us  to 


 put  our  children  tirst.  3 


 The  FCC’s  Notice  presents  several  important  areas  of  inquiry  with  sub-  headings 
 such  as  “Disclosure  Obligations,”  “Disaster  Warnings,”  “Disabilities,”  “Diversity,”  and 
 “Enhancing  Political  Discourse.“  4  While  the  obligations  regarding  children’s 
 programming  do  not  have  their  own  category,  the  FCC  does  request  comments  on  how 
 digital  broadcasters  may  serve  the  nation’s  children.  5 
 Considering  that  America’s  children  currently  consume  the  equivalent  of  a  full- 
 time  work  week  using  media  that  digital  television  will  provide,  they  may  be  one  of  the 
 most  vulnerable  and  needy  populations  with  respect  to  the  digital  transition.  6  First, 


 ’  See  People  for  Better  TV,  Petition  for  Rulemaking  and  Petition  for  Notice  of  Inquiry  (filed  June  3,  1999)  (PBTV  Petition);  Letter  from  People  for  Better  TV  to  William  E.  Kennard,  Chairman,  FCC,  Nov.  16,  1999 
 (PBTV  Letter).  *  Children  Now  has  conducted  informal  and  exploratory  conversations  with  experts  such  as:  Ms.  Peggy 
 Charren  (Founder,  Action  for  Children’s  Television),  Professor  Katharine  Heintz-  Knowles  (children’s  media  consultant),  Professor  Amy  Jordan  (Annenberg  School  for  Communications,  University  of 
 Pennsylvania),  Professor  Dale  Kunkel  (University  of  California,  Santa  Barbara),  Professor  Donald  Roberts  (Stanford  University),  Ms.  Marjorie  Tharp  (American  Academy  of  Pediatrics),  and  Dean  Ellen  Wartella 
 (University  of  Texas).  The  comments  of  these  participants  have  been  incorporated  into  this  statement  where  appropriate.

 38  hours  a  week.“).

 broadcast  content  designed  for  children  is  scarce  and  often  of  low  quality.  7  Parents 
 continually  search  for  and  request  more  quantities  of  higher  quality  programming  for 
 their  children.  8  As  recently  as  1999,  the  Journal  of  Broadcasting  &  Electronic  Media 
 published  a  survey  of  parents  regarding  the  Children’s  Television  Act  of  1996  and  the 
 Educational/  Informational  (“  E/  I”)  programming  requirements.  Although  63%  of  parents 
 had  not  heard  of  the  E/  I  requirements,  82%  of  parents  either  “somewhat  favored”  or 
 “strongly  favored”  them,  and  79%  thought  that  the  E/  I  programming  would  do  “some”  or 
 “a  lot”  of  good  for  children.  g  Parents  and  caretakers  of  America’s  young  people  are 
 asking  for  better  content  for  kids,  and  more  of  it. 
 Purther,  the  ancillary  and  supplementary  services  that  DTV  broadcasters  can 
 provide,  such  as  datacasting,  paging,  or  interactivity,  raise  the  specter  of  privacy  and 
 protection  concerns  that  have  haunted  children’s  policy  in  the  Internet  arena  for  the  past 
 several  years.”  Once  again,  the  enhanced  capabilities  to  inquire,  target,  and  collect  data 
 from  consumers  present  unparalleled  financial  opportunities  for  businesses  and 
 unparalleled  risks  for  the  public,  especially  children.  These  concerns  will  be  both 
 magnified  and  immediate  if  the  DTV  convergence  reaches  a  critical  mass. 
 Finally,  the  next  decade  will  host  a  DTV  dialogue  between  government, 
 broadcasters,  federal  agencies,  business,  and  the  public  that  is  filled  with  technical

 questions,  transition  timelines,  price  points,  market  penetration,  and  extraordinary 
 advances.  Perhaps  the  greatest  vulnerability  for  America’s  children  is  the  risk  of  being 
 eclipsed  amidst  the  unprecedented  technology  and  endless  commercial  opportunities. 
 Thus,  it  is  everybody’s  duty  to  realize  the  unprecedented  and  endless  opportunities  that 
 we  have  to  make  the  digital  world  a  better  place  for  children. 
 B.  Children  &  the  Advisory  Committee  on  the  Public  Interest  Obligations  of  Digital  Television  Broadcasters 


 In  1997,  Vice  President  Gore  and  the  Office  of  the  President  convened  an 
 Advisory  Committee  to  explore  the  public  obligations  of  digital  television  broadcasters, 
 which  resulted  in  a  comprehensive  final  report  with  broad  recommendations  for  the 
 FCC.  ’  ’  The  Committee  addressed  the  concerns  of  children  and  children’s  programming 
 at  several  points  throughout  its  report,  including  a  history  of  the  Children’s  Television 
 Act  and  the  public  mandate  for  broadcasters  to  serve  the  nation’s  children.  12  The 
 Advisory  Committee  made  the  following  specific  recommendations:  data  about 
 children’s  and  educational  programming  should  be  included  in  broadcasters’  quarterly 
 disclosures  of  public  interest  activities;  digital  stations  must  determine  or  ascertain  a 
 community’s  needs  and  interests  regarding  children’s  programming  as  part  of  their 
 minimum  public  interest  requirements;  the  FCC  should  reserve  the  equivalent  of  one  6 
 MHz  channel  in  each  viewing  area  from  recovered  analog  spectrum  for  noncommercial

 educational  programming,  including  children’s  education;  fee  collection  from 
 multiplexing  should  be  used  to  produce  and  air  educational  programming  that  would 
 otherwise  not  be  commercially  feasible;  broadcasters  should  datacast  educational 
 programming  from  preschool  through  higher  education  and  public  school  information; 
 and  broadcasters  should  have  the  option  of  a  “pay-  or-  play”  model  of  public  interest 
 obligations  where  collected  monies  would  be  applied  to  children’s  programming.  13 
 Children  Now  is  encouraged  by  the  Advisory  Committee’s  thoughtfulness 
 regarding  how  to  serve  the  nation’s  children  in  the  digital  era,  and  we  have  analyzed  and 
 incorporated  some  of  its  recommendations  and  principles  into  these  comments. 
 C.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission’s  Notice  of  Inquiry 
 The  FCC  Notice  invites  discussion  and  proposals  addressing  “whether  and  how 
 existing  public  interest  obligations  should  translate  to  the  digital  medium.“  14 
 Specifically,  the  FCC  is  requesting  comments  on  how  both  analog  and  digital 
 broadcasters  must  operate  consistently  in  the  public  interest  during  this  lengthy  transition 
 period  from  analog  to  digital.  15  Children  Now’s  comments  will  address  the  fol!  owing 
 requests,  with  a  focus  on  children  and  children’s  programming: 
 l  Mow  can  broadcasters  serve  the  nation’s  children  in  the  digital  environment? 
 (Notice  at  112); 
 l  Do  a  licensee’s  public  interest  obligations  apply  to  its  ancillary  and 


 supplementary  services?  Should  broadcaster  activities  on  ancillary  and 


 America’s  children  bears  a  direct  relationship  to  the  licensee’s  obligations  under  the  Communications  Act  to  operate  in  the  ‘public  interest.“‘). 
 “Advisory  Committee  Report  at  §$  III.  l.  111.3,  III.  4(  b)  (‘  The  opportunity  for  digital  television  to  improve  student  achievement  has  extraordinarily  high  stakes  for  our  Nation  .  .  .  We  put  our  children  at  a  competitive

 supplementary  services  count  toward  the  public  interest  obligations?  (Notice  at 
 ¶13>; 
 @  What  information  should  be  included  in  the  public  files  of  digital  broadcasters? 
 Do  the  FCC’s  reasons  for  eliminating  the  previous  ascertainment  requirements 
 apply  to  the  proposals  for  rule-  making  for  the  digital  era?  (Notice  at  116); 
 e  How  can  broadcasters  use  the  Internet  and  similar  capabilities  through  DTV  to 
 ensure  that  they  are  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  public?  (Notice  at  ¶17); 
 l  Should  the  Commission  establish  more  specific  minimum  requirements  or 
 guidelines  regarding  television  broadcasters’  public  interest  obligations?  If  so, 
 how  should  these  requirements  be  defined  and  communicated  to  licensees? 
 (Notice  at  122); 
 l  How  can  broadcasters  use  “multicasting”  and  other  new  technologies  associated 


 with  DTV  to  enhance  access  to  the  media  by  all  people,  particularly  people  from 
 diverse  and  under-  represented  backgrounds  ?  What  other  ways  could  and  should 
 the  Commission  encourage  diversity  in  broadcasting,  consistent  with  relevant 
 constitutional  standards?  (Notice  at  fl23,33). 


 II.  DTV’S  TECHNOLOGICAL  ADVANCES  &  CHILDREN 
 In  1997,  the  federal  government  allocated  an  additional  6  MHz  bandwidth  to 
 every  existing  broadcaster  as  part  of  a  giveaway  valued  at  approximately  $70  billion.  16 


 This  authorization  was  the  first  step  in  a  comprehensive  digital  conversion  plan,  targeted 
 for  completion  by  2006.  Toward  that  goal,  the  FCC  issued  a  timetable  for  digital

 Children  Now  7 
 broadcasting,  requiring  all  stations  affiliated  with  ABC,  CBS,  NBC,  and  Fox  in  the  top  10 
 markets  to  begin  at  least  one  digital  broadcast  by  May  1,  1999.  A  second  deadline  was 
 set  for  markets  1  l-  30  by  November  1,  1999.  t7  Thus  currently,  broadcasters  have  two  sets 
 of  bandwidth  to  use:  (i)  their  original  analog  bandwidth,  and  (ii)  the  additional  6  MHz 
 designated  for  digital  conversion.  As  the  transition  progresses,  the  FCC  has  determined 
 that  broadcasters  must  return  the  bandwidth  currently  used  for  analog  broadcasting  when 
 the  conversion  reaches  its  completion  point  (i.  e.,  spectrum  recovery).  Correspondingly, 
 the  FCC  and  Congress  have  asserted  that  portions  of  these  returned  bandwidths  will  be 
 designated  for  public  uses  such  as  public  safety  and  police  and  fire  department  needs.  l8 
 Although  2006  is  the  hard  deadline  originally  established  by  the  FCC,  the  completion 
 point  for  digital  conversion  has  been  debated  by  broadcasters  who  have  cited  numerous 
 time-  sensitive  obstacles  such  as  tower  construction  and  local  zoning.  Through  a  series  of 
 FCC  inquiries  and  hearings,  a  compromise  has  been  reached,  setting  a  modified  deadline 
 of  2006  unless  one  or  more  of  the  largest  television  stations  in  a  market  do  not  begin 
 DTV  transmission  through  no  fault  of  their  own  or  there  is  less  than  85%  market 
 penetration.  lg  In  any  case,  complete  conversion  is  scheduled  to  arrive,  shepherded  by 
 both  government  and  industry.

 Over  the  past  few  years,  the  media  attention  garnered  by  digital  television  has 
 focused  on  DTV’s  enhanced  audio-  visual  qualities  and  the  high  price  points  of  viewer 
 reception  equipment.*  ’  While  both  issues  have  significant  effects  on  the  public,  there  are 
 several  other  technological  advances  that  have  not  reached  mainstream  consciousness  but 
 will  impact  the  public  in  important  ways. 
 For  this  comment,  Children  Now  has  identified  three  specific  advances  that  will 
 affect  children  and  children’s  programming:  (1)  Enhanced  Audio-  Visual  Quality;  (2) 
 Multicasting;  (3)  Multiplexing  -  Ancillary  &  Supplementary  Services.  Further,  these 
 three  advances  combine  to  provide  an  overall  digital  viewer  experience;  the  variability  of 
 this  experience  due  to  individualized  bandwidth  management  is  a  separate  and  specific 
 area  of  concern.  In  this  section,  Children  Now  presents  each  advance  along  with  its 
 opportunities  to  improve  our  public  obligations  to  children  and  its  risks  that  children  will 
 be  overlooked  for  technology  and  business. 
 A.  Enhanced  Audio-  Visual  Quality 
 Most  of  the  attention  surrounding  DTV  has  concerned  the  leap  in  audio-  visual 
 (“  A/  V”)  effects,  presenting  a  television  experience  unlike  any  before.  Digital 
 broadcasting  will  provide  the  clearest  pictures  with  realistic  sound,  and  will  eliminate  the 
 reception  problems  commonly  associated  with  analog  television.*  l  Whereas  previously, 
 analog  broadcasts  offered  a  standard  NTSC  (National  Television  Systems  Committee) 


 transition  will  take  longer  than  most  people  in  the  industry  will  publicly  admit  .  .  .  at  least  10  to  12  years  -  or  even  longer.  This  period  is  much  lengthier  than  the  original  timetable  established  by  the  US  Congress.“)

 frame,  the  newer  digital  technology  can  present  a  standard  ATSC  (Advanced  Television 
 Systems  Committee)  screen  with  19-  to-  9  ratio  and  up  to  1080  lines  of  1920  pixels  for 
 2,073,600  pixels  per  frame.**  This  picture  is  commonly  referred  to  as  high-  definition 
 television  (“  HDTV”).  23  Correspondingly,  the  sound  quality  of  television  will  also 
 improve  dramatically  from  mono  and  stereo  to  5.1  Dolby  Digital  surround  sound  and  the 
 digital  quality  currently  found  in  compact  discs.  24  Thus,  there  is  a  hierarchy  of  A/  V 
 quality,  ranging  from  the  existing  low-  quality  analog  transmission  (NCTE)  to  middle- 
 quality  SDTV  digital  transmissions  to  high-  end  HDTV.  While  not  every  broadcast  in  the 
 digital  era  will  be  of  the  highest  possible  quality,  all  broadcasts  will  be  of  higher  quality 
 than  analog  transmission.*  ’  The  FCC  mandate  requires  some  amount  of  broadcasting  in 
 a  higher  quality  format  beginning  in  1998  and  increasing  in  quantity  until  complete 
 conversion. 
 Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  be  cognizant  of  the  opportunities  and  risks  for 
 children  that  enhanced  A/  V  capabilities  present.  First,  the  higher  A/  V  quality  can 
 provide  children  with  greater  educational  experiences  through  television.  For  example,

 science  programs  or  travelling  shows  will  be  able  to  present  people,  places,  and  things 
 through  more  realistic  pictures  and  sounds  than  ever  before.  While  it  is  not  yet  certain 
 how  DTV  will  ultimately  impact  education,  it  is  evident  that  the  technology  will  have  a 
 significant  and  tangible  effect  with  regard  to  engaging  young  viewers  and  encouraging 
 further  learning.  26  These  effects  and  other  enhancements  are  discussed  further  at  Part  II 
 (C-  D),  infra. 
 Second,  broadcasters  will  have  the  ability  to  vary  the  amount  and  quality  of  their 
 programming  menu  throughout  the  day  -  e.  g.,  airing  lower  AN  quality  SDTV 
 multicasting  during  early  morning  hours  and  higher  A/  V  quality  HDTV  during  prime- 
 time.  27  The  Advisory  Committee  on  Public  Interest  Obligations  of  Digital  Television 
 Broadcasters  (hereinafter,  “Advisory  Committee”)  noted  that  there  are  18  possible 
 formats  in  HDTV  and  SDTV.  28  While  this  flexibility  may  provide  more  overall 
 quantities  of  programming,  it  also  risks  having  a  segregation  effect  -  i.  e.,  certain 
 programming  receiving  priority  for  high  A/  V  quality  (e.  g.,  sports  games,  prime-  time 
 shows)  while  other  programming  is  relegated  to  low  A/  V  quality.  Higher  definition 
 programming  will  necessarily  require  higher  production  costs,  and  broadcasters  will  often 
 face  the  usual  business  efficiency  decisions  that  rely  heavily  on  viewership  ratings  and

 advertising  dollars.  29  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  consider  the  risks  and  possibilities 
 of  excluding  children’s  programming  from  the  highest  A/  V  quality  broadcasting. 
 Third,  the  enhanced  picture  and  sound  will  also  mean  a  more  realistic  viewer 
 experience  with  regard  to  images  of  sex  and  violence  that  may  be  inappropriate  for  young 
 children.  30  Given  the  long-  existing  concerns  in  this  area,  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC 
 to  research  and  analyze  the  impact  of  enhanced  A/  V  capabilities  on  children’s 
 consumption  of  such  images. 
 Finally,  more  research  and  analysis  is  needed  regarding  the  psychological  and 
 physical  effects  of  enhanced  A/  V  on  viewers,  especially  children.  In  December,  1997,  an 
 episode  of  Pokemon  that  aired  in  Japan  induced  several  hundred  cases  of  photosensitive 
 epileptic  seizures.  3’  Most  of  these  cases  involved  children.  More  recently,  experts  have 
 been  exploring  the  effects  of  new  technologies  such  as  virtual  reality  for  their  capacity  to 
 induce  physical  illness  in  consumers.  32  As  the  digital  conversion  introduces 
 technological  advances  that  make  home-  viewing  a  more  virtual  experience,  the  FCC 
 should  conduct  due  diligence  regarding  its  public  health  impact. 
 B.  Multicasting 
 Unlike  traditional  analog  broadcasting,  digital  broadcasting  uses  a  binary  system 
 of  l’s  and  O’s  to  transmit  high  quantities  of  data  in  an  extraordinarily  compact  form.  This 
 technology  is  currently  used  in  platforms  such  as  personal  computers,  compact  disc 


 2g  See  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  $III.  4.  a  (‘  The  startup  costs  of  converting  to  digital  signals  are  high,  and  just  as  significantly,  the  costs  of  producing  digital  programming  are  10  to  20  percent  higher  than  those 
 of  comparable  analog  programming.“).  3o  People  for  Better  TV,  The  Dangers  of  DTV,  (last  visited  Mar.  13,  2000)

 players,  and  the  Internet.  The  benefits  of  such  transmission  through  the  television  are 
 manifold,  such  as  picture  perfect  quality  and  Internet  capabilities.  33 
 Given  the  compression  power  of  digital  transmission,  the  additional  6  MHz  of 
 bandwidth  granted  to  broadcasters  represents  more  than  a  simple  100%  increase  in  a 
 station’s  programming  capacity.  While  the  additional  bandwidth  can  provide  one 
 channel  at  the  highest  A/  V  quality  (i.  e.,  HDTV),  it  can  also  sustain  several  simultaneous 
 channels  at  lower  qualities  (e.  g.,  SDTV).  This  ability  to  broadcast  multiple  channels  is 
 called  “multicasting.”  Multicasting  essentially  allows  each  current  broadcaster  to 
 become  its  own  mini-  network,  with  an  inverse  relationship  between  the  quantity  of 
 channels  and  the  A/  V  quality  on  those  channels.  34  At  present,  the  common  perception  is 
 that  the  additional  6  MHz  can  sustain  up  to  4-  6  channels  of  SDTV  transmission,  thereby 
 increasing  the  amount  of  available  programming  exponentially.  35  As  the  technology 
 develops,  the  number  of  possible  channels  may  increase  even  more. 
 The  power  of  multicasting  requires  broadcasters  to  engage  in  what  the  National 
 Association  of  Broadcasters  terms  “bandwidth  management.“  36  As  previously  discussed, 
 broadcasters  will  have  the  flexibility  to  vary  the  amount  and  A/  V  quality  of  programming 
 throughout  the  day.  For  example,  local  broadcaster  WXYZ  could  design  a  Monday  menu

 associated  benefits).  34  See  FCC,  Digital  Television  Tower,  supra,  at  Questions  2-  3  (“  There  is  a  trade-  off  between  using  digital 


 transmission  capacity  for  improved  pictures  and  sound  and  using  it  to  transmit  additional  programs.“):  Center  for  Media  Education,  supra  (“  Initially,  at  least,  the  latter  option  [of  SDTV  multicasting]  will  be  far 
 more  practical  (given  the  scarcity  of  sets  capable  of  displaying  HDTV),  which  means  that  every  local  TV  station  will  be  able  to  control  a  ‘mini-  network’  of  its  own.“);  Cringely  &  PBS,  supra,  at  Q  Multi-  Cusfing;

 that  airs  four  SDTV  channels  from  8  a.  m.  to  3  p.  m.,  switches  to  two  higher  definition 
 channels  from  3  p.  m.  to  8  p.  m.,  and  finishes  with  one  HDTV  channel  for  prime-  time  and 
 late-  night  programming.  Then,  WXYZ  could  change  its  amounts  and  quality  for  the 
 Tuesday.  37  Further,  WXYZ  may  choose  to  hold  a  special  pay-  per-  view  HDTV  broadcast 
 for  a  sporting  event,  in  lieu  of  its  scheduled  multicast  segment.  In  any  case,  digital 
 technology  and  the  bandwidth  giveaway  have  granted  broadcasters  an  enormous  amount 
 of  power  and  flexibility,  and  they  must  manage  the  station  schedule  for  optimal 
 performance. 
 This  model  of  variability  raises  several  serious  concerns  for  children’s  E/  I 
 programming.  In  addition  to  the  A/  V  quality  concerns  raised  in  Part  II.  A,  supru,  the 
 overall  amount  and  weeMy  proportion  of  children’s  programming  may  be  threatened. 
 Multicasting  capability  de-  standardizes  the  amount  of  programming  across  broadcasters. 
 Whereas  previously  there  was  a  relatively  constant  set  of  programmable  hours  for  each 
 broadcaster,  the  new  digital  regime  will  host  myriad  combinations  and  permutations  of 
 hours  and  A/  V  quality.  Every  broadcaster  in  America  can  and  probably  will  provide  a 
 different  combination  with  different  overall  hours  and  quality.  38  Thus  the  previous  hard- 
 fought  rule  for  three  hours  of  Educational/  Informational  children’s  programming  per 
 week  may  suffer  drastically  -  what  was  previously  three  hours  of  E/  I  programming  per 
 105  hours  of  effective  weekly  broadcasting3g  may  become  three  hours  per  1000  hours.

 broadcaster  will  have  the  flexibility  to  shift  back  and  forth  between  different  DTV  modes  in  different  day  ps”  r&.“). 


 See  NAB  &  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  supra  (“  One  new  benefit  of  the  digital  format  is  the  ability  to  apply  compression  and  vary  the  mix  of  digital  content,  broadcasting  one  program  in  high  definition 
 (HDTV)  or  several  in  standard  definition  (SDTV).  Broadcasters  will  have  a  broad  range  of  channel  options  in  their  business  mix.“).  These  variations  in  quality  are  explored  in  more  detail  at  Part  II  (C-  D),  infia. 
 39  Currently,  children’s  E/  I  programming  must  air  between  7  a.  m.  and  10  p.  m.  which  is  a  Ifi-  hour  period  for  each  day.  Seven  days  of  15  programmable  hours  totals  105  hours  per  week.

 As  the  Advisory  Committee  notes,  “Applying  existing  public  interest  obligations  to  this 
 variegated  universe  will  not  be  easy,  and  will  certainly  not  entail  a  simple  one-  for-  one 
 exchange.  “4a  Given  these  risks,  Children  Now  believes  that  it  is  of  utmost  importance  for 
 the  FCC  to  examine  the  public  interest  obligations  under  the  Children’s  Television  Act, 
 especially  the  Three-  Hour  Rule,  as  they  will  apply  to  the  digital  era.  We  provide  a  set  of 
 recommendations  addressing  this  requirement  at  Part  IV,  infra. 
 C.  Multiplexing  -  Ancillary  &  Supplementary  Services 
 The  FCC  Notice  and  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  characterize  DTV 
 services  such  as  datacasting,  paging,  and  interactivity  as  “ancillary  and  supplementary.“  41 
 These  services  may  be  offered  by  themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  broadcast 
 programming,  and  broadcasters  will  manage  their  bandwidth  distribution  accordingly. 
 The  transmittal  of  DTV  programming  and  ancillary  and  supplementary  services  at  the 
 same  time  is  termed  “multiplexing.“  42 
 DTV’s  ancillary  and  supplementary  services  are  closely  related  to  the  futurist 
 concept  of  “convergence,”  whereby  the  many  discrete  pieces  of  technical  hardware  in  use 
 today  -  such  as  personal  computers,  Internet,  video  gaming  consoles,  fax/  modems, 
 broadcast  radio  and  television,  cellular  communications,  cable  -  will  merge  into  one 
 platform.  43  Convergence  raises  several  new  policy  concerns  with  respect  to  children, 
 many  of  which  have  been  previously  addressed  separately  within  their  respective  media

 channels  and  ancillary  and  supplementary  services  at  the  same  time,  are  multicasting  and  multiplexing.

 (e.  g.,  Children’s  Television  Act  for  television,  Children’s  Online  Privacy  Protection  Act 
 for  Internet  marketing,  parental  advisory  labels  for  music).  Technological  advances 
 toward  convergence  will  necessarily  expedite  the  need  and  timeline  for  solutions  and 
 applications.  44  While  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  look  to  those  discrete  policy 
 solutions  for  guidance,  we  also  recognize  the  need  to  explore  new  solutions  specific  to 
 convergence  and  DTV. 
 Although  the  full  capacity  of  ancillary  and  supplementary  services  has  not  been 
 determined,  commentators  are  clearly  aware  of  their  enormous  potential’and 
 opportunities.  45  Digital  technology  is  currently  utilized  in  personal  computers  and  on  the 
 Internet  to  provide  large  amounts  of  data  and  to  interact  with  users.  DTV  broadcasters 
 have  the  capacity  to  use  a  portion  of  their  6  MHz  bandwidth  to  provide  similar  services, 
 currently  characterized  broadly  as  “datacasting”  and  “interactivity.” 
 Datacasting  is  providing  data  via  the  DTV  bitstream.  46  Any  information  that  can 
 be  coded  in  the  binary  scheme  of  l’s  and  O’s  can  be  transmitted,  such  as  stock  quotes, 
 product  prices,  computer  software,  closed  captioning,  database  content,  weather 
 animation,  sports  scores,  Internet  content,  interactive  educational  material,  multimedia 


 43  See  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  31.  What  is  Digital  Television  ?;  Cringely  &  PBS,  supra,  at  5  What’s 
 on  the  Z’V?  (“  The  convergence  of  television  and  computers  is  going  to  take  a  major  step  with  digital  broadcasts.“). 


 44  For  example,  commentators  have  noted  that  the  issues  of  violence,  pornography,  and  privacy  on  the  Internet  are  affecting  increasingly  larger  populations.  See,  e.  g.,  Paul  Van  Slambrouck,  New  Computer 
 Chip:  Useful  Tool  or  Privacy  Invasion.,  7  The  Christian  Science  Monitor,  Feb.  16,  1999,  at  2.  If  DTV  and 
 its  convergence  narrow  the  Digital  Divide  by  lowering  the  entry  price  points  for  Internet  connection,  then  those  issues  affect  a  far  greater  population  than  before  and  become  much  more  urgent. 


 ”  See  Cringely  &  PBS,  supru,  at  Q  I  Want  My  Enhanced  TV  (“  Nobody  really  knows  how  we’ll  interact  with  our  televisions  in  the  next  few  years,  but  TV  is  never  going  to  be  the  same.“);  NAB  &

 games,  or  illustrated  articles.  47  Selecting  personalized  data  will  be  a  function  of  user 
 interaction  with  the  television.  User  interactivity  through  the  television  has  been 
 attempted  previously  with  costly  external  network  connections,  but  digital  television  will 
 “embed  interactivity  inside  the  broadcast  signal,”  resulting  in  low  costs.  48  Viewers  will 
 be  able  to  communicate  with  the  television  and  with  others  through  the  television, 
 creating  a  more  personalized  and  potentially  educational  experience.  4g 
 DTV  datacasting  and  interactivity  offer  significant  opportunities  and  risks  for 
 children.  Many  digital  commentators  have  envisioned  how  DTV.  enhancements  may 
 improve  television  viewing,  including  programming  for  children.  For  example,  viewers 
 watching  a  documentary  on  dinosaurs  could  download  additional  information  on  certain 
 species  or  the  biography  of  a  scientist  on  the  program.  50  The  PBS  website  describes 
 possibilities  such  as  watching  a  lifelike  documentary  on  National  Parks  in  Africa  with 
 “amazing  clarity”  and  5.1  channel  sound,  followed  by  personalized  news  programming 
 that  presents  your  stocks,  weather,  sports  scores,  and  interest  pieces,  followed  by  E/  I 
 programming  where,  “You  and  your  kids  play  some  learning  games  with  Big  Bird,  replay

 are  learning  by  doingYY5’  People  for  Better  TV  conjectures  that  DTV  may  make  it 
 possible  for  “a  child  in  West  Virginia  to  talk  to  an  astronaut  aboard  a  space  station.“  52 
 Benton  Foundation  DTV  pundit  Andy  Carvin,  formerly  of  the  Corporation  for  Public 
 Broadcasting,  presents  detailed  examples  and  actual  experiments  of  enhanced  TV  applied 
 to  education,  from  PBS  documentaries  on  Henry  V  and  Frank  Lloyd  Wright 
 supplemented  by  multimedia  content,  to  a  NOVA  special  where  children  can  construct 
 virtual  Stonehenges  or  pyramids,  to  a  Great  Performances  program  where  children  can 
 isolate  instruments  and  rearrange  music.  53  Carvin  also  identifies  the  possibilities  for 
 teacher  professional  development  through  DTV.  54  Through  technological  advancements, 
 DTV  can  expand  greatly  the  educational  mission  of  public  television.  55 
 Another  pivotal  opportunity  lies  in  DTV’s  ability  to  affect  the  Digital  Divide.  56 
 While  the  majority  of  Americans  do  not  currently  have  Internet  connectivity  at  home, 
 most  Americans  do  have  television  set.  Because  DTV  can  broadcast  websites  and  other 
 multimedia  content  without  high-  speed  Internet  connectivity,  DTV  is  able  to  bring  the 
 Internet  to  millions  of  people  at  home  or  in  institutions  such  as  schools,  through  the 
 purchase  of  DTV  tuner  PC  cards,  set-  top  boxes,  or  digital  televisions.  57  However,  the 
 Digital  Divide  cannot  be  overcome  unilaterally.  Although  the  content  provider  end  of 
 Internet  services  will  be  able  to  send  digital  data  through  free  broadcast  airwaves,  end- 
 users  still  require  new  hardware  to  receive.  The  actual  closure  of  the  divide  will  depend

 on  the  price  points  for  conversion  (i.  e.,  whether  it  will  be  financially  accessible  to  a 
 greater  population)  and  overcoming  relevant  biases.  58  Nonetheless,  as  the  government 
 and  broadcasting  industry  urge  convergence  on  the  DTV  platform,  a  massive  conversion 
 may  result  simply  because  current  television  owners  will  not  forego  their  basic  television 
 services  as  they  currently  forego  the  Internet.  The  externality  of  making  people  buy 
 digital  televisions  to  get  basic  television  would  be  closing  the  current  Internet  divide.  In 
 any  case,  DTV’s  actual  effect  on  the  Digital  Divide  remains  to  be  determined  as 
 technology,  market  economics,  politics,  and  policy  continue  to  develop. 
 Exclusion  from  enhancement,  personalized  commercialization,  and  invasions  of 
 privacy  are  some  of  the  primary  risks  for  children  regarding  datacasting  and  interactivity 
 services.  Just  as  DTV  has  the  opportunity  to  enhance  children’s  education  and  close  the 
 Digital  Divide,  there  is  the  converse  risk  that  children’s  programming  will  be  excluded 
 from  higher-  end  services  and  that  lower-  income  populations  will  not  receive  DTV. 
 Further,  as  DTV  becomes  interactive  and  personalized,  companies  will  collect  more 
 information  about  viewers  and  can  customize  integrated  advertising  and  direct  marketing 
 within  programming.  Just  as  today’s  Internet  marketers  can  track  user  movements  and 
 purchases,  convergence  will  enable  marketers  to  monitor  viewer’s  program  choices  and 
 behavior  with  enhanced  information-  gathering  techniques.  This  will  result  in 
 commercials  that  can  address  the  viewer  -  especially  children  -  directly  and  intimately,

 Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  consider  the  opportunities  for  fuller  and  richer 
 children’s  education  through  the  affirmative  allocation  of  bandwidth  to  datacasting  and 
 interactivity  to  children’s  programming.  We  also  urge  the  FCC  to  consider  the  risks 
 associated  with  possible  exclusion  from  ancillary  and  supplementary  services,  and  with 
 personalized  commercialization  and  advertising  to  young  people.  Finally,  Children  Now 
 urges  the  FCC  to  monitor  the  actual  effects  of  the  DTV  convergence  on  the  current 
 Digital  Divide. 
 D.  Digital  Viewer  Experience  Quality  (DVEJQ)  &  Bandwidth  Management 
 The  upshot  of  these  technological  advances  is  that  broadcasters  will  have  a 
 limited  amount  of  bandwidth,  but  exponentially  more  power  and  flexibility  than  ever 
 before.  Technology  has  made  the  capacity  of  the  6  MHz  bandwidth  seemingly  limitless. 
 In  the  digital  era,  broadcasters  have  the  phenomenal  ability  to  vary  the  viewer’s 
 experience  by  allocating  A/  V  quality,  datacasting,  interactive  components,  and  multiple 
 programming  hours,  in  any  combination  or  permutation  that  they  wish.  Overall 
 bandwidth  management  will  be  more  than  simply  channels  and  A/  V  quality.  6o 
 Throughout  the  pre-  digital  era,  the  public  television  viewing  experience  was 
 mostly  standard  from  channel  to  channel.  Each  broadcaster  had  an  identical  finite 
 amount  of  programming  hours  per  week  and  all  broadcasts  had  the  same  analog  A/  V

 quality.  With  DTV,  the  experience  can  range  from  a  program  similar  to  yesterday’s 
 analog  broadcast  to  an  16:  9,  high-  definition,  multi-  casting,  surround-  sound  program 
 enhanced  with  streaming  datacast  and  interactive  participation.  61  To  quantify  this  range, 
 Children  Now  introduces  a  variable  entitled  Digital  Viewer  Experience  Quality  (DVEQ) 
 that  refers  to  the  different  types  of  experiences  that  are  now  possible  with  DTV. 
 The  primary  concern  with  DVEQ  and  children  is  the  exact  same  concern  we  have 
 identified  regarding  multicasting,  multiplexing,  and  the  inverse  relationship  between 
 quality  and  quantity  -  Will  children’s  programming  become  segregated  at  the  low  end  of 
 the  quality  spectrum  ?  Given  the  higher  production  costs  associated  with  HDTV, 
 datacasting,  and  interactivity,  how  much  E/  I  programming  will  be  broadcast  in  Iow- 
 definition  with  nothing  else?  Will  children’s  E/  I  programming  be  afforded  the  important 
 opportunity  to  participate  in  advanced  technology  for  expanded  learning  experiences,  or 
 will  those  technologies  be  designated  exclusively  for  high  profit  margin  ventures  such  as 
 sporting  events  and  pay-  per-  view  events  ?  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  further 
 consider  these  concerns  regarding  exclusion  in  its  rule-  making  process. 


 ma.  TME  CHILDREN’S  TELEVISION  ACT 
 A.  Background 
 Since  the  1960’s,  children’s  advocates  have  urged  the  FCC  to  protect  the  public 
 interest  of  children  by  mandating  a  minimum  level  of  educational  children’s 
 programming.  Since  then,  an  ongoing  debate  has  ensued  among  broadcasters,  Congress, 


 6’  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  $1,  What  is  Digital  Television?  (“  Because  different  gradations  of  HDTV  and  SDTV  picture  resolution  are  possible  -  there  are  18  different  transmission  formats  -  a  station  can  mix 
 and  match  video  programming  with  data  services,  provided  that  the  various  signals  fit  within  the  6  MHz  bandwidth.“);  Cringely  &  PBS,  supra,  at  0  The  Many  Facts  of  HDTV.

 Children  Now  21 
 the  FCC,  advocates,  and  parents  about  minimal  standards  for  children’s  educational 
 programming  and  how  such  standards  should  be  defined.  62 
 Thirty  years  of  debate  about  commercial  broadcasters’  obligation  to  air  children’s 
 educational  programming  demonstrate  one  certainty.  Without  stringent  requirements 
 mandated  by  the  FCC,  broadcasters  do  not  voluntarily  serve  the  needs  of  children.  Self- 
 regulation  is  not  an  option  to  ensure  the  protection  of  children’s  public  interest.  As  the 
 FCC  considers  policy  recommendations  for  the  application  of  the  Children’s  Television 
 Act  in  the  digital  arena,  Children  Now  urges  the  mandating  of  specific  guidelines.  The 
 history  of  the  Children’s  Television  Act  demonstrates  that,  for  the  most  part,  unless  faced 
 with  external  pressure,  the  commercial  broadcast  industry  has  largely  neglected 
 children’s  educational  programming.  63 
 During  the  197Os,  the  FCC  did  not  mandate  specific  policy  on  children’s 
 educational  television  requirements.  In  197  1,  the  FCC  did  initiate  a  rulemaking  on 
 children’s  television,  which  yielded  voluntary  changes  in  the  National  Association  of 
 Broadcasters’  code  two  years  later.*  The  NAB  agreed  to:  1)  make  clear  distinctions 
 between  children’s  programs  and  commercials;  2)  prohibit  the  practice  of  host-  selling;  3) 
 ban  ads  for  drugs  and  vitamins  during  children’s  shows;  and  4)  proposed  self-  regulated 
 limits  for  commercials  of  9  minutes  per  hour  on  weekdays  and  12  minutes  per  hour  on 
 weekends.  65  These  limits,  according  to  the  FCC,  “struck  a  balance  between  the  needs  of 
 children,  who  were  judged  uniquely  susceptible  to  commercial  influence,  and  the  needs

 of  broadcasters,  who  were  dependent  upon  advertising  revenue  to  maintain  the  children’s 
 program  offerings.“  66  Thus,  instead  of  mandating  rules,  the  FCC  issued  a  1974  Policy 
 Statement  noting  that  “broadcasters  have  a  special  obligation  to  serve  children”  67  and 
 asked  stations  to  provide  a  “reasonable  amount”  68  of  educational  programming. 
 By  the  late  197Os,  the  FCC  determined  that  broadcasters’  self-  regulation  was  not 
 working,  and,  in  its  1979  Children’s  Television  Report,  offered  more  prescriptive  rules.  69 
 These  rules,  however,  were  never  implemented  as  new  commissioners  came  to 
 Washington  in  the  1980s.  In  1984,  led  by  Commissioner  Mark  Fowler,  the  FCC 
 determined  that  the  marketplace  alone  could  adequately  respond  to  children’s  needs.  70 
 Commercial  broadcasters  no  longer  had  to  air  educational  programming  as  long  as 
 children’s  needs  could  be  served  by  other  services  such  as  public  television,  cable, 
 satellite,  and  videos. 
 This  new  policy  resulted  in  a  notable  decline  in  children’s  educational 
 programming,  and  several  studies  documented  this  dramatic  decrease.  7’  One  study,  for 
 example,  showed  that  commercial  broadcasters  did  not  provide  a  single  children’s 
 educational  show  during  a  sample  week  in  the  greater  Los  Angeles  area.  72  According  to 
 Professor  Dale  Kunkel  at  the  University  of  California  at  Santa  Barbara,  “Even  the 
 relatively  small  amount  of  educational  programs  that  had  been  provided  previously  on

 commercial  television  essentially  disappeared  once  the  FCC  deregulated  kids’ 
 television.“  73 
 During  the  198Os,  the  FCC  also  ruled  that  the  market  place  should  determine  how 
 much  commercial  content  could  be  included  in  children’s  programming.  The  FCC 
 therefore  dropped  the  limits  on  the  amount  of  advertising  in  children’s  television  and 
 relinquished  the  previously-  established  ban  on  “program-  length  commercials,”  30- 
 minute,  toy-  based  programs.  Subsequently,  advertising  on  children’s  programming 
 increased  considerably;  a  study  found  that  children’s  advertising  on  the  networks  in  1990 
 averaged  lo:  05  minutes  per  hour  compared  to  eight  minutes  in  1983.74  Similarly,  there 
 was  a  tremendous  increase  in  “program-  length  commercials;”  for  example,  profits  from 
 the  sale  of  licensed  products  based  on  the  program,  Teenage  Mutant  Ninja  Turtles, 
 yielded  $1.1  billion  by  1991  .75 
 B.  The  Children’s  Television  Act  of  1990 
 Throughout  the  198Os,  it  became  increasingly  evident  that  the  FCC  could  not  rely 
 on  broadcasters’  self-  regulation  to  meet  the  educational  needs  of  children.  Thus,  in  1990, 
 Congress  passed  the  Children’s  Television  Act  (CTA)  which  marked  a  new  era  for 
 television  broadcasters.  Under  the  CTA,  “as  part  of  their  obligation  to  serve  the  public 
 interest,  television  station  operators  and  licensees  should  provide  programming  that 
 serves  the  special  needs  of  children.  y’76  The  Children’s  Television  Act  also  limited 
 advertising  during  children’s  programs  to  12  minutes  per  hour  on  weekdays,  10.5  minutes

 per  hour  on  weekends.  Finally,  the  Act  mandated  that  the  FCC  revisit  and  re-  examine  its 
 policy  on  children’s  program-  length  commercials.  77 
 In  subsequent  years,  the  broad  coalition  of  groups  that  helped  ensure  the  passage 
 of  the  CTA  -  including  Action  for  Children’s  Television,  the  National  PTA,  the  National 
 Education  Association,  and  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  -  was  often 
 disappointed  with  how  the  Act  was  being  implemented.  Because  there  were  no  specific 
 mandates  about  quantity  of  programming,  broadcasters  aired  as  little  as  30  minutes  of 
 educational  programs  a  week.  In  addition,  many  programs  that  stations  deemed  “FCC- 
 friendly”  were  “scheduled  in  pre-  dawn  time  slots  when  few  people  were  likely  to  be 
 watchingTy7*  or  were  often  preempted  by  Saturday  sports  programming.  Finally,  without 
 qualitative  guidelines  on  what  constitutes  “educational  and  informational  programming,” 
 many  networks  documented  shows  such  as  The  .Jetsons  and  Leave  It  to  Beaver  as 
 educational. 
 Yet  when  it  came  to  the  quantifiable  commercial  time  limits  for  children’s 
 programming,  broadcasters  made  considerable  strides  in  complying  with  the  Act. 
 According  to  a  November  1993  FCC  study,  98  percent  of  stations  showed  compliance 
 with  the  commercial  limits,  up  from  95  percent  in  1992.7g  Thus,  it  appears  that  setting 
 specific  quantifiable  requirements  under  the  Children’s  Television  Act  is  helpful,  and 
 arguably  essential,  in  garnering  broadcasters’  compliance.

 C.  The  Children9s  Television  Act-  More  Stringent  Rules 
 In  1996,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  revised  the  CTA  to  address 
 the  concerns  of  advocates  and  parents,  by  providing  more  stringent  and  specific 
 quantifiable  rules  for  children’s  educational  programming.  The  FCC  guidelines  require 
 that  core  programming  be  designed  to  educate  and  inform  children  ages  16  and  under.*  ’ 
 Under  the  FCC’s  new  guidelines,  broadcasters  are  required  to:  1)  broadcast  a  minimum 
 of  three  hours  per  week  of  educational  and  informational  television  for  children;  2) 
 specify  in  writing  the  educational  and  informational  objective  of  a  program,  as  well  as  its 
 target  chiId  audience;  3)  air  programs  between  the  hours  of  7:  OOam  and  10:  OOpm;  4) 
 ensure  that  broadcasts  are  regularly  scheduled  to  assist  parents  in  selecting  educational 
 programs  for  their  children;  5)  broadcast  programs  that  are  at  least  30  minutes  in  length; 
 and  6)  identify  “E/  I”  programs  (for  educational  and  informational)  at  the  beginning  of 
 each  program.  81 
 I9,  The  Three-  Hour  Rule:  Is  It  Eiving  Up  To  Its  Expectations?

 compliance  with  the  Children’s  Television  Act.  The  most  recent  study,  The  Three-  Hour 
 Rule:  Is  it  Living  Up  to  Expectations?  examined  the  quantity  and  quality  of  broadcasters’

 broadcasters  are  airing  the  required  three  hours  of  educational  programming.  82  The  report 
 found  that  the  Three-  Hour  Rule  has  effectively  increased  the  number  of  programs 
 available  to  children  during  hours  when  they  are  likely  to  watch.  In  addition,  60%  of 
 stations  offer  more  than  the  three-  hour  minimum  of  core  educational  programming. 
 Whereas  before  the  Three-  Hour  Rule’s  implementation  many  of  the  E/  I 
 (educational/  informational)  programs  were  aired  in  pre-  dawn  hours,  the  1998/  99  TV 
 season’s  programs  can  be  found  between  the  hours  of  7:  OOam  and  10:  OOpm. 
 The  report  also  found  that  approximately  80%  of  the  E/  I  programs  evaluated  in  a 
 nationally  representative  media  market  are  meeting  the  letter  and  sometimes  the  spirit  of 
 the  law.  One  third  of  these  programs  are  even  highly  educational.  The  “highly 
 educational”  programs  come  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including:  programs  that 
 originally  aired  on  PBS  (such  as  Magic  School  Bus,  Bill  Nye,  The  Science  Guy  and  New 
 Zoo  Revue);  those  developed  as  a  result  of  the  Three-  Hour  Rule  (such  as  Pepper  Ann, 
 Popular  Mechanics  for  Kids  and  Brain  Stew);  locally-  produced  programs  (such  as  UP  ‘N 
 Running  and  HyperTek);  Spanish  language  programs  (Pistus  de  Blue  and  Plaza  Sesamo); 
 religious  programs  (Al  Denson  ‘s  Studio  828  and  Quigley  ‘s  Village)  and  those  airing  in 
 syndication  (Real  Life  101  and  Nick  News).  These  programs  tackle  a  variety  of  lessons 
 and  audiences  and  are  particularly  effective  at  making  these  lessons  relevant  to  the  lives 
 of  children. 
 While  they  note  these  and  other  improvements,  the  Annenberg  reports  also  show 
 that  there  is  still  a  need  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  CTA.  For  instance,  over  one-  fifth 


 of  the  programs  labeled  educational  and  informational  in  their  sample  had  “little  or  no

 educational  value  and  failed  to  meet  the  guidelines  set  forth  by  the  FCC.“  83  While  these 
 shows  do  not  deserve  the  E/  I  label,  they  continue  to  air  on  commercial  broadcast  stations 
 (programs  such  as  NBA  Znside  StufSand  Peer  Pressure  have  aired  in  two  consecutive  TV 
 seasons  without  any  noticeable  improvement). 
 There  also  still  appears  to  be  some  confusion  at  the  station  level  about  what 
 constitutes  E/  I  programming.  There  were  several  questionable  programs  identified  on  the 
 FCC  398  reports  that  were  not  validated  by  the  syndicator  or  network  contact;  however 
 there  is  less  variation  in  the  way  that  broadcasters  are  complying  with  the  children’s 
 television  act  under  the  Three-  Hour  Rule. 
 The  report  found  that  while  broadcasters  are  complying  with  the  Three-  Hour 
 Rule,  and  making  an  effort  to  meet  the  educational  needs  of  children,  their  efforts  warrant 
 improvement.  There  are  still  too  many  programs  airing  that  are  not  educational  and  too 
 few  highly  educational  programs  available. 
 E.  The  Three-  Hour  Rule:  Insiders’  Reactions 
 In  order  to  evaluate  fully  the  Three-  Hour  Rule,  the  Annenberg  Public  Policy 
 Center  also  conducted  a  poll  of  television  industry  executives,  academics,  and 
 advocates.  84  Most  noted  an  improvement  in  children’s  educational  programming,  citing 
 more  diversity  in  type  of  programming,  and  an  increased  quantity  and  quality  of  shows. 
 Respondents  noted  that  violent  and  offensive  shows  disappeared,  and  the  number  of 
 programs  devoid  of  educational  content  decreased  by  50  percent.  They  also  reported  that

 the  rule  resulted  in  an  increased  dialogue  between  “the  broadcast  industry  and  the 
 scholarly  and  academic  communities.“  85 
 Despite  the  improvements,  more  than  half  of  the  respondents  felt  that  the 
 educational  objectives  of  the  rule  were  not  being  fully  realized.  They  found  that  while 
 children’s  programming  was  less  objectionable  after  implementation  of  the  rule,  it 
 nevertheless  could  not  be  deemed  truly  educational,  noting  that  a  majority  of  the 
 programming  address  social  and  emotional  concerns  rather  than  teaching  academic 
 concepts.  To  address  this  concern,  respondents  recommended  that  broadcasters: 
 1)  diversify  all  aspects  of  the  programs; 
 2)  increase  promotion  and  media  coverage  of  children’s  programming; 
 3)  establish  funding  sources  for  new  educational  programs; 
 4)  provide  more  research  to  create  efficient  educational  programs  that  appeal  to 
 children; 
 5)  create  a  national  public  information  campaign  about  educational 
 programming. 
 F.  Local  Observations  Relevant  to  the  Children’s  Television  Act 
 Over  the  last  several  months,  the  broad  coalition  of  organizations  known  as 
 People  for  a  Better  TV  (PBTV)  have  assessed  compliance  of  their  local  television 
 stations  with  the  guidelines  of  the  CTA  by  recording  children’s  programs  and  examining 
 the  public  files  at  their  local  stations.  Comments  and  observations  about  local  stations’ 
 commitment  to  children’s  programming  centered  mostly  on  station  compliance  with  the 
 three-  hour  requirement  and  critiques  of  the  types  of  programs  offered  to  children.

 Children  Now  29 
 Overall,  local  organizations  across  the  country  found  that  most  stations  comply 
 with  the  minimum  required  hours  with  most  stations  airing  only  three  to  four  hours  of 
 educational  programming.  86  For  example,  the  California  chapter  of  the  National 
 Organization  for  Women  stated  that  KRON,  the  NBC  affiliate  in  San  Francisco,  makes, 
 “ONLY  the  minimal  commitment  to  children’s  programming  [with]  3  to  3.5  hours  per 
 week  [and]  no  programs  during  the  week.”  Children  Now  noted  that  KPIX,  the  CBS 
 affiliate  in  San  Francisco,  aired  less  than  their  self-  reported  three  hours,  as  their 
 children’s  programming  was  preempted  by  sports. 
 Other  stations  across  the  country  were  also  shown  to  have  only  minimum 
 compliance.  The  Massachusetts-  based  Center  for  Technology  &  Society  evaluated  the 
 CBS  affiliate  in  Boston,  WBZ,  and  noted  they  aired  exactly  three  hours  of  children’s 
 programming,  a  drop  from  1997  when  they  aired  6  hours.  A  Detroit  station,  WXYZ 
 (ABC)  fared  slightly  better  than  Boston’s  WBZ,  with  four  hours  of  children’s 
 programming. 
 While  stations  claim  to  be  airing  three  hours  a  week  of  E/  I  programming,  they  are 
 not  consistently  labeling  shows  as  such.  Many  of  these  programs  came  up  repeatedly  in 
 the  evaluations  including  Pepper  Ann,  Squigglevision,  Popular  Mechanics  for  Kids, 
 Sabrina  the  Animated  Series,  and  Mythic  Warriors.  The  Christian  Communication 
 Council  of  Detroit  observed  that  some  of  these  programs  were  identified  “specifically  to 
 educate  and  inform  children,”  thus  complying  with  the  “E/  I”  label  requirement,  while 
 others  were  simply  identified  “for  children  of  all  ages.”  Children  Now  noticed  similar 
 inconsistency  in  the  programs  that  they  monitored.  Three  of  the  four  stations  reviewed 


 M  The  ABC  affiliate  in  Houston,  KTRK,  aired  4.5  hours  of  educational  programming.  The  Fox  and  ABC  affiliates  in  San  Francisco,  aired  8  hours  and  5.5  hours  of  children’s  programming  respectively. 
31
 Children  Now  30 
 had  the  E/  I  logo  and  only  two  listed  the  target  age  group  for  which  the  program  was 
 designed. 
 In  addition  to  the  inconsistency  in  identifying  E/  I  programming,  there  was  a 
 perception  that  programs  were  not  labeled  in  a  way  that  is  convenient  for  parents.  Jim 
 Jones  of  Child  Serve  noted  the  difficulty  of  planning  ahead  because  most  newspapers  do 
 not  carry  the  E/  I  logo  and  he  wrote,  “you  must  be  quick  and  on  time  to  find  the 
 designation  as  the  show  begins  because  the  ‘E/  I’  logo  appears  only  briefly  on  screen.” 
 Some  organizations  questioned  the  true  educational  value  of  programs  that  were 
 labeled  as  E/  I  shows.  In  a  review  of  WABC’s  public  files  in  New  York  City,  the 
 characterization  of  101  Dalmatians  and  &b&  a  as  E/  I  programming  was  deemed 
 “questionable.”  Similarly,  Children  Now  noted  that  at  the  San  Francisco  ABC  affiliate, 
 KGO,  “only  two  out  of  five  programs  [had]  a  clearly  educational  intent.”  Other 
 organizations  remarked  on  the  perceived  leniency  of  labeling  programs  as  educational  or 
 informational.  For  instance,  NYU  graduate  students  who  visited  the  public  files  of  the 
 Fox  affiliate  in  New  York  City  said,  “‘  Of  particular  interest  in  the  children’s/  educational- 
 programming  files  are  these  TV  shows  listed  as  “programming  of  interest  to  children’: 
 Beverly  Hills  90210,  Party  of  Five,  and  The  Simpsons.”  Child  Serve’s  Jim  Jones  notes,  “I 
 fail  to  see  how  some  of  these  shows  can  be  deemed  educational  or  informational.  .  .  .  The 
 majority  of  the  shows  teach  children  that  it  is  vital  to  be  cool,  outsiders  will  always  be 
 treated  poorly  and  although  being  yourself  is  very  important,  you  better  be  good  looking, 


 good  at  sports  or  well-  dressed  because  brains  still  work  against  you.”  The  Center  for 
 Technology  &  Society  summed  up  these  concerns  by  saying,  “A  clever  writer  could  take 
 almost  any  program  on  television  and  laud  about  its  ability  to,  say,  ‘improve  social 
32
 Children  Now  31 
 skills.“  ’  They  continued  by  saying  their  organization  “would  like  to  see  clear  evidence 
 that  professionals  involved  with  children’s  learning  such  as  librarians,  education  faculty, 
 and  communications  faculty  are  examining  and  shaping  these  few  shows  for  their 
 positive  effect  on  children.” 
 G.  Mandating  Rules  in  a  New,  Digital  Era 
 Broadcasting  is  a  business;  it  would  be  naive  to  ignore  the  fundamental  role  of  the 
 bottom  line  for  broadcasters.  Indeed,  the  history  of  the  Children’s  Television  Act 
 demonstrates  that,  when  left  to  regulate  themselves,  broadcasters  will  not  choose  a  public 
 interest  obligation  to  our  nation’s  children  over  advertising  revenues.  Even  those 
 broadcasters  whose  personal  philosophies  might  dictate  “doing  the  right  thing,”  are 
 operating  in  an  intensively  competitive  sphere.  When  left  to  self-  regulation,  acting  on 
 honorable  intentions  carries  too  great  a  business  risk  for  the  great  majority  of  those  in  the 
 industry. 
 As  the  Annenberg  studies  and  People  for  Better  TV’s  local  observations 
 demonstrate,  while  broadcasters  currently  are  generally  complying  with  the  Children’s 
 Television  Act,  there  is  still  room  for  considerable  improvement.  Stringent,  quantifiable 
 rules  continue  to  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  broadcasters  meet  children’s  educational 
 needs.  As  television  moves  from  an  analog  to  a  digital  system,  Children  Now  urges  the 
 FCC  not  to  rely  once  again  on  self-  regulation  and  “good  faith”  from  the  broadcasting 
 industry.  Rather,  fair  regulations,  defined  and  enforced  by  the  FCC,  can  ensure  that 
 broadcasters  meet  their  obligation  to  children  in  this  new  digital  age. 
33
 Children  Now  32 
 IV.  ANALYSES  &  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 Children  Now  proposes  the  following  recommendations  with  the  hope  that  public 
 interest  service  in  broadcasting  will  be  continued  and  enhanced.  For  all  these 
 recommendations,  Children  Now  also  advises  that  the  FCC  consider  careful  phasing-  in 
 and  implementation  of  standards  and  obligations  over  the  period  of  time  for  transition 
 and  conversion  from  analog  to  digital.  87  Each  recommendation  should  have  built-  in 
 periodic  reconsideration,  particularly  for  technological  advances,  market  responses,  and 
 any  other  factors  that  may  impact  the  overall  effectiveness  of  a  recommendation. 
 A.  Minimum  Public  Interest  Obligations  Should  Be  Specific 
 Along  with  People  for  Better  TV,  members  of  the  Advisory  Committee,  the 
 Media  Access  Project,  and  the  Benton  Foundation,  Children  Now  believes  that  minimum 
 public  interest  standards  and  obligations  must  be  specific  and  detailed  in  order  to  give 
 them  meaning  and  effect.  88  Moreover,  the  conversion  to  digital  is  an  unprecedented, 
 complex  process  and  necessarily  requires  specific  guidelines  during  the  transition  period 
 and  afterwards  These  requirements  and  guidelines  should  be  communicated  clearly  to 
 broadcasters  during  the  license  renewal  process  to  ensure  compliance  and  to  ease  any 
 broadcasters’  concerns  regarding  their  status.  Children  Now  supports  the  Advisory 
 Committee’s  recommendation  of  five  categories  for  minimum  standards,  in  addition  to 
 the  specific  recommendations  contained  in  these  comments.  89  Compliance  would  be 
 facilitated  through  quarterly  reporting  as  detailed  in  Part  IV.  C,  in.  ru. 


 87  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  $111.3  (“  Any  set  of  minimum  standards  should  be  drafted  by  the  FCC  in  close  conjunction  with  broadcasters  and  representatives  of  the  public,  and  phased  in  over  several  years 
 beginning  with  stations’  transmission  of  digital  signals.”  (emphasis  added)).  **  Id.;  Notice  at  821  n.  68.

 B.  Serving  the  Nation’s  Children 
 The  following  recommendations  are  particular  to  the  FCC’s  request  regarding 
 how  to  serve  nation’s  children.  (Notice  at  4[  12). 
 I.  The  Children’s  Television  Act  in  Digital 
 Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  maintain  and  enforce  all  of  the  current 


 requirements  of  the  Children’s  Television  Act  in  the  digital  era.”  In  addition  to 
 complying  with  a  proportional  Three-  Hour  Rule  described  below,  broadcasters  still  must 
 be  required  to:  1)  specify  in  writing  the  educational  and  informational  objective  of  a 
 program,  as  well  as  its  target  child  audience;  2)  air  programs  between  the  hours  of 
 7:  OOam  and  10:  OOpm;  3)  ensure  that  broadcasts  are  regularly  scheduled  to  assist  parents 
 in  selecting  educational  programs  for  their  children;  4)  broadcast  programs  that  are  at 
 least  30  minutes  in  length;  and  5)  identify  “E/  I”  programs  at  the  beginning  of  each 
 program.”  Again,  as  evidenced  from  the  history  of  the  Children’s  Television  Act,  if  the 
 FCC  does  not  explicitly  state  and  enforce  these  rules,  broadcasters  will  not  voluntarily 
 meet  the  educational  and  informational  needs  of  children  in  the  new  digital  era. 
 However,  Children  Now  also  recognizes  that  the  digital  television  landscape  is 
 complex,  creating  difficulties  in  applying  directly  the  current  public  interest  obligations 
 regarding  children.  As  the  Advisory  Committee  noted, 
 Analog  broadcasters  send  one  signal,  usually  24  hours  a  day.  Digital  broadcasters  may  send  one  or  multiple  signals,  at  many  different  time  periods  throughout  the  day.  Some  of 
 these  signals  may  be  programs;  others  may  involve  data  transmissions  or  other  broadband  and  telecommunications  services.  The  vast  new  range  of  choices  inherent  in  digital 
 television  technology  makes  it  impossible  to  transfer  summarily  existing  public  interest  obligations  to  digital  television  broadcasting.  A  key  mandate  for  the  Advisory 


 90  See  Notice  at  94,  citing  Fifth  Report  and  Order,  supra,  at  12809,  12810-  12811,  12830  (1997)  (“  Likewise,  in  implementing  section  336,  the  Commission  reaffirmed  that  ‘digital  broadcasters  remain  public  trustees 
 with  a  responsibility  to  serve  the  public  interest,  ’  and  state  that  ‘existing  public  interest  requirements  continue  to  apply  to  all  broadcast  licensees.“‘);  Fifth  Report  and  Order,  supra,  at  12830,  (PSO. 
 91  Policies  and  Rules  Concerning  Children’s  Television  Programming,  1996,  supra,  at  $1(  3-  5). 
35
 Children  Now  34 
 Committee,  therefore,  has  been  to  suggest  how  traditional  principles  of  public-  interest 
 performance  should  be  applied  in  the  digital  era.  92 


 Thus,  Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  apply  the  current  Children’s 
 Television  Act  and  corresponding  FCC  rules  to  digital  broadcasters  in  the  following 
 manner: 
 a.  The  Digital  Three-  Hour  Rule  for  E/  I  Programming:  Proportional  Hours  Requirement 


 As  the  Advisory  Committee  accurately  notes,  “.  .  .  if  broadcasters  decide  to  use 
 their  digital  real  estate  for  multiple  commercial  channels  (whether  or  not  they  are  high 
 definition),  each  generating  its  own  revenue  stream,  then  it  is  appropriate  to  consider 
 whether  the  public  interest  requires  a  differentformz.&~.“~~  With  respect  to  multicasting, 
 this  argument  for  reconsideration  of  particular  public  interest  formulas  is  strengthened  by 
 the  fact  that  although  the  FCC  assesses  fees  from  digital  broadcasters  who  get  paid  for 
 ancillary  or  supplementary  services,  the  multicasting  feature  is  free  of  charge.  94 
 First,  each  digital  broadcaster  should  provide  an  amount  of  weekly  E/  I 
 programming  that  is  proportional  to  the  three  .hours  per  week  requirement  currently 
 administered  under  the  Children’s  Television  Act  of  1990.  This  rule  transfers  the  current 
 Three-  Hour  Rule  to  digital  in  a  fair  and  commensurable  way,  accounting  for  the 
 increased  amount  of  programming  possible  through  multicasting.  Unlike  a  flat  hour  rule, 
 it  does  not  penalize  broadcasters  who  choose  to  program  fewer  hours  than  their 
 colleagues.  Thus,  the  obligation  of  digital  broadcasters  is  effectively  the  same  us  it  was 
 during  the  analog  era. 


 ”  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  §III.  93  Advisory  Committee  Report  at  $111.5  (emphasis  added). 
 94  Id. 
36
 Children  Now  3.5 
 Children  Now  recommends  an  application  of  the  traditional  Three-  Hour  Rule  that 
 becomes  the  Three-  Percent  Rule.  First,  we  establish  a  baseline  proportion  of  three  hours 
 per  one-  hundred  and  five  (105)  programmable  broadcast  hours  per  week  -  premised  on 
 the  current  15  hours  per  day  (between  7  a.  m.  and  10  p.  m.)  window  for  E/  I  programming 
 for  seven  days  per  week.  This  provides  a  simple  and  realistic  percentage  to  apply  to 
 expanded  hours  in  the  digital  era  -  3/  605  or  approximately  3%  for  administrative 
 simplicity.  Once  broadcasters  have  calculated  their  total  digital  broadcast  hours  per 
 week,  they  should  multiple  that  total  by  3%  and  round  up  to  the  closest  frveltenths  (i.  e., 
 0.5)  since  half-  hour  segments  are  the  smallest  unit  for  programming.  This  will  yield  a 
 preliminary  E/  I  hours  requirement,  subject  to  adjustment  by  the  proportional  DVEQ 
 process  detailed  in  Part  IV.  B(  l)(  b),  infru.  Children  Now  has  provided  a  sample  case 
 study  worksheet  in  Appendix  A. 
 Broadcasters  are  currently  required  to  file  quarterly  reports  that  detail  meeting 
 their  E/  I  requirements,  and  this  calculation  and  evaluation  process  will  follow  the  same 
 schedule  in  the  digital  era.  The  amounts  and  figures  required  for  the  Digital  Three-  Hour 
 Rule  will  be  reported  in  the  quarterly  filings,  and  will  determine  the  broadcaster’s  E/  I 
 requirements  for  the  following  quarter.  The  sample  worksheet  in  Appendix  A  functions 
 similarly  to  the  disclosure  worksheet  proposed  by  the  Advisory  Committee  -  it  is  a 
 simple  and  minimally  burdensome  method  to  assure  the  public  and  broadcasters  that 
 public  interest  obligations  are  being  fulfilled. 


 b.  The  Digital  DVEQ  Rule  for  E/  I  Programming:  Proportional  DVEQ  Requirement 


 Second,  the  rules  should  also  protect  against  segregation  of  E/  l  programming  into 
 the  lowest  DVEQ  as  determined  by  A/  V  quality  and  multiplexing  (e.  g.,  datacasting  and 
37
 Children  Now  36 
 interactive  participation).  E/  I  programming  must  partake  of  the  technological  advances 
 in  the  same  proportion  that  a  broadcaster  chooses  to  use  them  overall.  Children  Now 
 recommends  that  with  each  quarterly  report,  broadcasters  must  file  a  calculation  of  how 
 their  programming  hours,  apart  from  E/  Zprugrumming,  is  distributed  with  respect  to 
 DVEQ  (e.  g.,  How  many  hours  are  broadcast  in  HDTV  with  streaming  datacast?  How 
 many  hours  are  broadcast  in  SDTV  as  part  of  a  four-  channel  multicast  with  no 
 multiplexing?  How  many  hours  are  broadcast  in  each  of  the  18  possible  formats?).  Once 
 this  overall  DVEQ  distribution  is  computed,  broadcasters  must  apportion  their  required 
 E/  I  programming  hours  accordingly.  All  calculations  must  round  up  to  the  nearest  five- 
 tenths,  since  half-  hour  segments  will  be  the  smallest  unit  for  programming. 
 Importantly,  this  recommendation  preserves  the  broadcasters’  flexibility  and 
 power  to  determine  their  optimal  mix  of  services  and  bandwidth  management.  The  FCC 
 determined  that  this  flexibility  was  prudent  and  declined  to  mandate  a  standard  amount  of 
 services  that  would  rest  on  “a  prior  assumptions  as  to  what  services  viewers  would 
 prefer.“  95  However,  this  recommendation  also  protects  E/  I  programming  against 
 segregation  and  also  promotes  use  of  advanced  technologies  to  enhance  the  educational 
 experiences  of  television.  Children’s  E/  I  programming  should  participate  in  the  benefits 
 of  multiplexing  and  high-  definition  AN  as  much  as  broadcasters  choose  to  use  these 
 services.  Children  Now  has  provided  a  sample  case  study  worksheet  in  Appendix  A. 
 C.  Pay  or  Play  Model 


 If  the  FCC  wants  to  maximize  broadcasters’  flexibility,  they  could  consider  a 
 “Pay  or  Play”  model  as  a  way  in  which  broadcasters  could  meet  their  obligation  to  the 
 digital  Three-  Hour  Rule.  Under  this  model  public  interest  obligations  are  quantified,  and 
38
 Children  Now  37 
 broadcasters  have  the  choice  of  meeting  these  obligations  through  their  own 
 programming  or  by  paying  a  share  of  revenues  to  bypass  those  obligations.  96 
 Should  the  FCC  consider  such  a  model,  Children  Now  urges  them  to  consider  it 
 as  a  means  of  expanding  our  recommendation  for  a  digital  Three-  Hour  Rule.  Again, 
 under  Children  Now’s  proposal  for  a  digital  Three-  Hour  Rule,  broadcasters’  obligation  to 
 E/  I  programming  would  increase  proportionaIly  to  the  number  of  hours  they  are  multi- 
 casting.  A  “Pay  or  Play”  model  would  simply  increase  broadcasters’  flexibility  in 
 meeting  this  public  interest  obligation, 
 Children  Now  encourages  the  FCC  to  consider  a  “Pay  or  Play”  approach  that  is 
 analogous  to  the  trading  of  “pollution  rights”  under  the  Clean  Air  Act  Amendment  of 
 1990.  Essentially,  the  Act  successfully  reduced  sulfur  dioxide  emissions  by  giving 
 companies  allowances  that  they  could  buy,  save,  or  use  from  other  companies.  97  With  its 
 public  interest  obligation  already  quantified,  the  Children’s  Television  Act  could  serve  as 
 an  appropriate  archetype  for  the  “Pay  or  Play”  mode1.98 
 The  FCC  could  maximize  broadcasters’  flexibility,  by  giving  them  the  option  of 
 airing  the  required  hours  of  E/  I  programming  on  their  own  channels,  paying  other 
 networks  or  channels  to  air  these  hours  for  them,  or  a  combination  thereof. 
 As  it  stands,  the  1996  Children’s  Television  Act  enables  broadcasters  to  serve 
 children  by  producing  or  supporting  shows  that  are  then  broadcast  by  another  station.  99

 To  date,  broadcasters  have  not  taken  advantage  of  this  opportunity  but  the  “Pay  or  Play” 
 model  could  facilitate  their  participation  One  of  the  benefits  of  this  model  is  that  it  could 
 promote  partnerships  between  commercial  broadcasters  or  commercial  and  non- 
 commercial  broadcasters  in  a  given  market.‘  Oa  The  model  also  could  provide  much 
 needed  financial  support  to  public  broadcasters,  who  have  a  strong  interest  in  and 
 commitment  to  E/  I  programming. 
 There  are  several  drawbacks  to  the  “Pay  or  Play”  model  that  the  FCC  should  take 
 into  account  if  they  are  to  mandate  such  a  policy.  Critics  contend  that  under  such  a 
 model,  broadcasters  will  opt  for  the  least  expensive  alternative,  which  will  most  likely  be 
 to  air  programming  on  their  own  stations,  which  could  be  of  extremely  poor  quality.  lo1 
 Critics  also  argue  that  this  model  will  relegate  public  interest  programming  to  public 
 broadcasting,  which  would  result  in  Iess  exposure  for  America’s  children.  lo2  Another 
 concern  is  that  commercial  broadcasters  may  not  pay  public  broadcasters  enough  to  be 
 able  ameliorate  the  current  public  broadcaster’funding  shortage,  which,  in  the  end,  could 
 reduce  the  quality  of  E/  I  programming.  103 
 Such  concerns  could  be  mitigated  if  the  FCC  mandates  stringent  guidelines  to  a 
 “Pay  or  Play”  model  for  the  Children’s  Television  Act.  The  FCC  should  develop  a 
 formula  to  quantify  the  economic  vahre  of  an  hour  of  E/  I  programming.  ‘04  Such  a

 ‘04  According  to  proponents  of  this  model,  a  payout  of  all  public  service  requirements  (not  just  E/  I  programming)  would  be  about  two  percent  of  broadcasters  gross  revenues,  currently  valued  at  $26  billion.

 formula  should  take  into  account  Children  Now’s  proposed  DVEQ  (digital  viewer 
 experience  quality)  as  a  means  of  quantifying  the  range  of  experiences  that  are  now 
 possible  with  DTV.  Thus,  the  price  tag  for  an  hour  of  E/  I  programming  would  vary 
 depending  on  the  level  of  the  DVEQ  of  the  program.  As  previously  stated,  broadcasters 
 should  apportion  their  required  E/  I  programming  hours  according  to  their  overall.  DVEQ 
 distribution.  Such  apportionment  should  mollify  some  of  the  concerns  about  E/  I 
 programming  quality  in  a  “Pay  or  Play”  model. 
 The  “Pay  or  Play”  model  will  require  more  data  gathering  and  monitored 
 enforcement  by  the  FCC  to  ensure  broadcasters’  compliance.  When  broadcasters  file  their 
 quarterly  reports  on  their  E/  I  obligation,  they  should  be  required  to  report  whether  they 
 aired  these  hours  themselves  or  paid  another  station  to  fulfill  their  responsibility.  They 
 must  disclose  the  name  of  the  station  that  aired  the  hours  for  them,  and  the  amount  that 
 they  paid.  Again,  the  payment  must  be  based  on  the  formula  previously  determined  by 
 the  FCC,  which  should  include  the  DVEQ  as  a  variable.  The  FCC  must  be  prepared  to 
 enforce  these  rules,  and  to  apply  fines  when  necessary  to  ensure  compliance. 
 d.  Diversity  of  Programming 
 In  order  to  meet  the  educational  needs  of  the  vast  child  audience,  it  is  essential 
 that  broadcasters  provide  a  range  of  E/  I  programming.  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  be 
 cognizant  of  the  importance  of  diversity  in  children’s  educational  programming, 


 particularly  in  regards  to:  1)  the  age  of  the  target  audience;  and  2)  the  production  locale.

 .  1.  Target  Audience 


 Age-  related  differences  in  children’s  cognitive  abilities  influence  their  ability  to 
 comprehend  and  decipher  media  messages.  lo5  Preschool-  age  and  young  children  often 
 cannot  understand  media  content  because  it  is  too  conceptual  or  complex,  causing  their 
 attention  to  wane.  to6  In  order  to  attract  children’s  attention,  broadcasters  must  create 
 programming  that  is  targeted  to  different  age  groups,  taking  into  account  the  needs  and 
 abilities  of  children  of  these  specific  groups.‘  o7  According  to  Dr.  Kelly  Schmidt,  author  of 
 The  Three-  Hour  Rule:  Is  It  Living  ‘Up  To  Expectations?,  ,minimal  E/  I  programming  exists 
 for  children  under  the  age  of  five.  Although  this  trend  may  represent  a  reluctance  among 
 broadcasters  to  label  programming  appropriate  for  that  age  group,  it  also  could  be  that 
 some  advertisers  feel  that  preschoolers  are  not  a  legitimate  market.  lo8 
 Our  youngest  children  can  benefit  tremendously  from  E/  I  programming  that  is 
 developmentally  appropriate;  it  cannot  only  educate  and  entertain,  but  it  can  prepare 
 children  for  school,  and  has  even  been  shown  to  improve  test  scores.  According  to  a  1995 
 University  of  Kansas  study,  preschoolers  in  low-  income  areas  who  watched  educational 
 children’s  programming  were  not  only  better  prepared  for  school,  but  actually  performed 
 better  on  verbal  and  math  tests  as  late  as  age  7  than  would  have  been  expected  otherwise. 
 The  study  also  found  that  preschoolers  who  only  watched  adult  programs  and

 entertainment-  oriented  cartoons  did  worse  on  those  later  tests  than  would  have  been 
 anticipated.  lo9 
 Under  the  1996  Children’s  Television  Act,  broadcasters  are  required  to  disclose 
 the  target  age  group  that  their  E/  I  programs  serve.  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to 
 minimally  require  the  same  disclosure  of  digital  broadcasters  and  to  consider  the 
 importance  of  serving  all  children  in  the  new  digital  era. 


 ii.  Production  Locale 
 Locally-  produced  programs  provide  an  important  niche  for  children,  as  they  can 
 educate  and  inform  them  about  their  community,  as  well  as  offer  ideas  of  local  activities 
 in  which  to  participate.  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  consider  the  benefits  that  locally- 
 produced  shows  bring  to  the  children  in  the  communities  they  serve.  Currently,  there  is  a 
 dearth  of  such  types  of  E/  I  programming.  According  to  the  Annenberg  Public  Policy 
 Center,  only  65  of  about  1200  E/  I  shows  were  locally  produced  in  1999;  commercial 
 broadcasters  generally  receive  all  of  their  E/  I  programming  from  the  network  with  which 
 they  are  affiliated.  ’  lo 
 Most  respondents  of  the  Annenberg  poll,  The  Three-  Hour  Rule:  The  Insiders’ 
 View,  feel  that  there  is  a  lack  of  E/  I  programs  being  produced  by  local  stations,  and  many 
 complained  that  there  is  a  diminishing  cadre  of  players  in  the  production  community.  The 
 FCC  may  want  to  consider  ways  of  encouraging  local  broadcasters  to  produce  some  of 
 their  own  E/  I  programming,  as  a  means  of  diversifying  E/  I  programming  available  to 
 children  in  different  communities.

 e.  Ratings  and  the  V-  Chip 
 In  1997,  after  great  debate  between  children’s  advocates  and  broadcasters,  a  new 
 voluntary  television  ratings  system  was  implemented  to  give  parents  adequate 
 information  about  the  programs  that  their  children  watch.  Parents  now  have  a  ratings 
 system  that  includes  content-  based  ratings,  instead  of  age-  based  ratings  only.  The  new 
 system  consists  of  content  descriptors  (V,  S,  L,  D)  which  inform  parents  about  shows  that 
 contain  high  levels  of  violence,  sexual  situations,  coarse  language,  and  suggestive 
 dialogue,  respectively.  These  ratings  are  used  to  rate  most  types  of  television  shows 
 including  dramas,  comedies,  soap  operas,  movies,  and  talk  shows.  The  new  system  also 
 enhances  the  ratings  for  children’s  programs  by  adding  an  indicator  for  children’s  shows 
 that  include  violent  material  (FV  for  fantasy  violence). 
 V-  Chip  technology,  when  used  in  conjunction  with  the  TV  ratings  system, 
 enables  parents  to  block  programming  they  consider  inappropriate  for  their  children. 
 During  the  first  fifteen  minutes  of  a  program,  broadcasters  send  an  electronic 
 identification  signal  that  indicates  a  program’s  rating;  the  V-  Chip  then  receives  and 
 processes  this  signal.  ‘I1  If  parents  have  blocked  shows  with  specific  ratings,  the  V-  Chip 
 prevents  such  shows  from  appearing  on  their  television  screen. 
 As  television  moves  from  an  analog  to  a  digital  system,  Children  Now  urges  the 
 FCC  to  ensure  that  the  V-  Chip  and  ratings  system  are  available  to  parents.  According  to  a 
 1999  poll  conducted  by  the  Henry  J.  Kaiser  Family  Foundation,  more  than  three  fourths 
 of  parents  (77%)  said  that  if  they  had  a  V-  Chip  at  home,  they  would  use  it  to  block  out

 programming  they  deemed  inappropriate  for  their  children.‘*  2  Similarly,  six  out  of  ten 
 parents  said  they  are  concerned  a  ‘*  great  deal”  that  their  children  are  being  exposed  to  too 
 much  sex  (66%)  or  violence  (60%).  t13  With  broadcasters’  new  multicasting  capability, 
 children  will  have  access  to  many  more  channels  and  programs,  potentially  exposing 
 them  to  more  violence,  sex,  crude  language  and  suggestive  dialogue.  Thus,  the  ratings 
 and  accompanying  V-  Chip  technology  should  be  available  so  that  parents  can  monitor  the 
 shows  their  children  watch  in  the  digital  age. 
 Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  consider  how  the  advanced  capabilities  of  digital 
 broadcasting  can  help  to  provide  ratings  information  to  parents.  Currently,  the  ratings 
 symbol  appears  in  the  top  upper  left-  hand  corner  of  the  screen  during  the  first  fifteen 
 seconds  of  a  television  program.  In  order  to  determine  the  rating  of  a  show,  parents  must 
 either  watch  the  beginning  of  the  program,  or  check  their  local  TV  guide.  More  than  two 
 thirds  of  parents  (67%)  report  that  even  when  they  looked  for  the  rating  on  their 
 television  screen,  they  frequently  missed  it.  ‘I4  Similarly,  eight  out  of  ten  parents  who  use 
 the  ratings  said  that  the  ratings  symbol  should  appear  on  the  screen  more  often.‘  15  With 
 digital  television’s  capability  to  transmit  data  simultaneous  with  programming, 
 broadcasters  could  make  ratings  (as  well  as  E/  I  information)  available  throughout  the 
 length  of  a  program.  Broadcasters  could  also  use  datacasting  to  provide  parents  with 
 information  as  to  why  a  show  received  a  particular  rating  or  is  categorized  as  E/  I 
 programming.  Using  the  interactive  capabilities  that  potentially  will  be  available,  with  a.

 click  of  the  mouse,  parents  could  access  pertinent  program  information  at  any  point 
 during  the  broadcast. 
 Children  Now  also  asks  that  the  FCC  consider  using  digital  television’s  increased 
 capabilities  to  augment  the  current  ratings  system  to  provide  even  more  information  to 
 parents.  The  FCC  has  indicated  that  it  would  take  “an  open,  flexible  approach  to  the 
 development  of  industry  standards  and  regulations  that  would  accommodate  the  possible 
 development  of  multiple  ratings  systems.  911’6 
 The  FCC  should  consider  requiring  broadcasters  to  provide  additional  content 
 ratings  information  from  independent  sources.  Eight  out  of  ten  voters  favor  an 
 independent  ratings  system  (84%),  and  think  that  developing  such  a  system  is  important 
 (87%).“  7  Digital  technology  should  allow  for  the  provision  of  multiple  ratings  systems. 
 Such  systems  could  be  made  available  through  the  V-  Chip  itself  (by  using  the  additional 
 spectrum  available)  or  by  providing  links  to  the  Internet  where  such  information  could  be 
 accessed.  More  research  needs  to  be  conducted  as  to  how  the  V-  Chip  and  TV  ratings 
 system  can  work  most  effectively  for  parents  in  the  digital  era.  Children  Now  urges  the 
 FCC  to  issue  an  NO1  to  further  explore  this  issue  and  to  determine  how  to  maximize 
 content  and  ratings  information  for  parents. 


 f.  Commercials 
 As  television  moves  from  an  analog  to  a  digital  system,  Children  Now  urges  the 
 FCC  to  maintain  the  current  regulations  about  advertising  and  children’s  television 


 programming,  specifically  in  regards  to  time  limits  and  program-  commercial  separation. 


 “’  13  FCCRcd  11248,11251  (1998). 
46
 Children  Now  4.5 
 1.  Time  Limits 
 The  Children’s  Television  Act  of  1990  limited  advertising  during  children’s 
 programs  to  12  minutes  per  hour  on  weekdays,  and  10.5  minutes  per  hour  on  weekends. 
 Broadcasters  have  overwhelmingly  adhered  to  this  rule,  with  a  1993  study  showing  98% 
 of  stations  in  compliance.“*  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  uphold  this  rule  in  the 
 digital  era,  and  maintain  these  limits  on  advertising  during  children’s  programming. 


 ii.  Program-  Commercial  Separation 
 Research  indicates  that  by  the  age  of  five,  most  children  are  able  to  identify 
 commercials  aired  during  television  programs.  It  is  not  until  age  seven  or  eight,  however, 
 that  they  truly  understand  the  persuasive  intent  of  advertising.  In  other  words,  children 
 under  seven  see  advertisements  as  part  of  television  entertainment,  while  children  seven 
 and  older  are  “coming  to  terms  with  the  fact  that  advertisers  are  ‘trying  to  get  people  to 
 buy  something.“  ’  Thus,  Children  Now  urges  the  FCC  to  uphold  three  current  rules  which 
 help  children  to  distinguish  between  commercials  and  the  content  of  the  show: 
 1)  Program  length  commercials:  Broadcasters  cannot  “air  a  program  associated 
 with  a  product  in  which  commercials  for  that  product  are  aired.““  9 
 2)  Host-  selling:  program  characters  or  show  hosts  are  not  allowed  to  sell 
 products  in  commercials  during  or  adjacent  to  their  shows.“  ’

 2.  Additional  Opportunities  and  Obligations 
 In  addition  to  applying  traditional  principles  of  public-  interest  performance  with 
 appropriate  modifications,  the  Advisory  Committee  also  discussed  appropriate  additional 
 public  interest  obligations  “given  the  enhanced  opportunities  and  advantages  that 
 broadcasters  may  receive  through  digital  broadcasting.“‘  22  Children  Now  agrees  with  the 
 principle  that  “there  should  be  some  additional  benefit  to  the  public  if  its  grant  to 
 broadcasters  of  the  valuable  digital  television  spectrum  results  in  enhanced  economic 
 benefits  for  broadcasters.“  123  Further,  as  detailed  above  at  Part  II,  supra,  the 
 technological  advances  of  DTV  offer  exponentially  more  opportunities  to  meet  children’s 
 educational  and  informational  needs.  The  FCC  should  ensure  that  those  opportunities  for 
 America’s  children  are  not  overlooked  in  this  pivotal  transition. 
 Comments  from  the  Center  for  Media  Education  (hereinafter,  “CME”)  present  a 
 set  of  options  that  broadcasters  may  use  to  satisfy  their  additional  public  interest 
 obligations  to  children.  The  Advisory  Committee  laid  out  a  similar  model  of  alternatives 
 in  its  discussion  of  multiplexing  capabilities  and  the  need  for  additional  benefits  to  the 
 public.  ‘24  The  CME  model  is  composed  of  two  levels  of  options,  offering  broadcasters

 broadcasters  the  power  to  combine  options  and  to  optimize  their  bandwidth  management. 
 CME  suggests  that  broadcasters  may  choose  to  fulfill  their  obligations  by:  providing 
 more  educational  and  informational  (E/  I)  programming;  paying  a  fee  to  a  fund  that 
 support  noncommercial  programming;  or  providing  broadband  and  datacasting  services 
 to  local  schools  and  libraries.  For  each  of  these  options,  broadcasters  have  a  variety  of 
 methods  to  consider.  For  example,  providing  more  E/  I  programming  may  be 
 accomplished  by  dedicating  an  entire  channel  to  E/  I  programming,  dedicating  one  hour  of 
 E/  l  programming  for  every  20  hours  of  multicasting,  setting  aside  a  channel  for  children’s 
 programming  and  dedicating  a  substantial  amount  to  E/  l  shows,  or  setting  aside  a  channel 
 for  noncommercial  public  interest  programming  and  dedicating  a  substantial  amount  to 
 E/  I  shows.‘  26 
 Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  additional  obligations  for 
 digital  broadcasters  regarding  children  and  children’s  programming.  Further,  Children 
 Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  the  flexible  and  effective  model  proposed  by 
 CME  as  part  of  its  rule-  making  process. 
 3.  Childrenps  Privacy  &  Protection  on  DT’V 
 Convergence  through  the  DTV  platform  will  necessarily  bring  the  current  Internet 
 policy  issues  of  invasions  of  privacy  and  excessive  advertising  to  the  television  arena.  As 
 detailed  above  at  Parts  1.  A  and  EC,  supru,  it  is  possible  that  these  policy  concerns  will 


 quickly  affect  a  much  larger  population  of  children  if  the  Digital  Divide  is  narrowed  by 
 DTV.  Correspondingly,  Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  additional

 research  and  advocacy  in  these  new  media  policy  arenas.  Comments  submitted  by  CME 
 detail  recommendations  for  additional  safeguards,  including:  the  application  of  the 
 Children’s  Online  Privacy  Protection  Act  of  1998  (COPPA)  and  corresponding  Federal 
 Trade  Commission  rules  to  DTV  broadcasters  collecting  information  from  children;  the 
 application  of  existing  advertising  policies  and  regulations  on  all  programs  that  are 
 directed  toward  children  twelve  (12)  and  under  regardless  of  what  program  stream  they 
 are  on;  and  a  prohibition  of  all  links  to  advertising  or  sales  during  children’s 
 programming.  ‘27 
 Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  the  expertise  of  CME  and  their 
 proposals  for  additional  privacy  and  advertising  safeguards,  in  its  rule-  making  process. 
 C.  Disclosure  Requirements 
 Children  Now  agrees  with  the  principle  that  effective  self-  regulation  requires 
 broadcasters  to  disclose  adequately  their  information  regarding  what  they  are  doing.  The 
 current  FCC  disclosure  rules  require  commercial  TV  broadcasters  to  include  in  their 
 public  files  separate  quarterly  reports  regarding  their  non-  entertainment  programming 
 responsive  to  community  needs  and  their  children’s  programming.  ‘*  ’  These  data  include 
 items  such  as  citizen  agreements,  records  concerning  public  office  candidate  broadcasts, 
 employment  reports,  correspondence  with  the  public,  issues/  programming  lists,  records 
 concerning  commercial  limits  in  children’s  programming,  and  children’s  programming 
 reports.‘  2g  Toward  the  goal  of  significant  and  effective  disclosures  in  the  digital  era, 
 Children  Now  makes  the  following  recommendations:

50
 Children  Now  49 
 First,  Children  Now  recommends  that  the  current  information  reporting 
 requirements  established  for  implementing  the  Children’s  Television  Act  continue  to 
 apply  to  all  digital  broadcasting,  including  ancillary  and  supplementary  services. 
 Second,  Children  Now  joins  the  recommendations  of  the  Advisory  Committee 
 and  People  for  Better  TV  regarding  enhanced  disclosure  requirements  for  digital 
 broadcasters.  13’  Enhanced  reporting  is  necessary  due  to  the  complex  and  exponentially 
 richer  landscape  of  DTV  compared  to  analog  broadcasting.  Broadcasters  should  report 
 on  their  “public  interest  programming  and  activities  on  a  quarterly  basis,  using 
 standardized  check-  off  forms  that  reduce  administrative  burdens  and  can  be  easily 
 understood  by  the  public.“  131  The  enhanced  set  of  data  should  “include  but  not  be 
 limited  to  contributions  to  political  discourse,  public  service  announcements,  children’s 
 and  educational  programming,  local  programming,  programming  that  meets  the  needs  of 
 underserved  communities,  and  community-  specific  activities.“‘  32 
 Third,  Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  affirmatively  revisit  its  repeal  of 
 previous  ascertainment  requirements,  and  explore  whether  any  of  the  revoked 
 requirements  have  particular  relevance  and  application  to  DTV.‘  33  This  exploration 
 should  consider  whether  a  specific  requirement  is  applicable  today  as  well  as  whether  it 
 will  be  applicable  as  the  transition  to  digital  television  proceeds. 
 Finally,  Children  Now  joins  the  Advisory  Committee  in  its  recommendation  that 
 digital  broadcasters  take  affirmative  steps  to  distribute  their  public  interest  obligation  data 


 Stations,  MM  Docket  No.  97-  138,  Report  and  Order,  13  FCC  Rdc  15691  (1998)  (Public  File  Report  and  Order).

 more  widely  through  channels  such  as  local  newspapers,  local  program  guides,  and  the 
 Internet.‘  34  Members  of  the  People  for  Better  TV  coalition  took  considerable  effort  to 
 obtain  public  information  from  broadcasters  during  the  early  part  of  2000  in  order  to 
 comment  in  this  proceeding;  any  measures  that  facilitate  this  process  would  better  serve 
 the  public  and  fulfill  the  true  intent  of  the  rule.‘  35 
 D.  Diversity 
 Diversity  of  programming  has  long  been  a  cornerstone  of  the  broadcasting 
 industry,  from  the  Great  Lakes  Broadcasting  Co.  rules  in  1929  to  the  Blue  Book  policy 
 statement  in  1946  to  the  1960  Programming  Policy  Statement,  and  up  to  recent  national 
 discussions  regarding  prime-  time  diversity  highlighted  by  the  National  Association  for 
 the  Advancement  of  Colored  People  in  1999.‘  36  Both  the  FCC  and  the  Advisory 
 Committee  have  addressed  the  importance  of  diversity  in  broadcasting  with  respect  to 
 viewpoint,  ownership,  and  employment.  137  As  the  FCC  notes,  many  of  the  Advisory 
 Committee’s  “recommendations  bear  on  its  goal  of  diversity  in  broadcasting,”  with 
 proposals  ranging  from  the  capacity  of  multicasting  to  better  serve  underrepresented 
 minorities  in  content  and  entrepreneurship  to  the  use  of  recovered  analog  spectrum  for 
 noncommercial  programming  directed  at  underserved  segments  of  the  community  to 
 “hiring  and  promotion  policies  that  result  in  significant  representation  of  minorities  and 
 women  in  the  decision-  making  positions  in  the  broadcast  industry.“  r3*

 A  consistent  theme  in  the  Advisory  Committee’s  final  report  is  that  serving 
 diverse  interests  and  promoting  diversity  in  broadcasting  is  both  “good  business  and  good 
 public  policy.  ,439  The  Advisory  Committee  addresses  growing  commitments  to  equal 
 employment  opportunities  in  the  digital  era,  expanded  possibilities  for  diversity  of 
 programming  due  to  multicasting  and  multiplexing  (e.  g.,  “‘  narrowcasts”),  designated 
 noncommercial  educational  channels  and  datacasting  to  underprivileged  and  minority 
 communities,  and  enhanced  audio  capabilities  for  increased  use  of  foreign  language 
 tracks.  14’  Children  Now  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  all  of  the  Advisory 
 Committee’s  proposals  and  arguments  for  promoting  diversity  in  broadcasting  in  its  rule- 
 making  process,  and  supports  the  FCC  in  its  undertaking  of  initiatives  designed  to 
 diversify  broadcast  ownership  and  employment. 
 Children  Now  also  recommends  that  the  FCC  consider  the  effects  of  DTV 
 convergence  on  the  Digital  Divide  and  diversity,  as  discussed  at  Part  ILC,  supra.  While 
 the  actual  closure  of  the  divide  will  depend  primarily  on  the  price  points  of  receiver 
 hardware,  the  politics  of  convergence  may  force  the  public  to  purchase  and  thereby  bring 
 a  greater  population  on-  line. 
 Finally,  Children  Now  and  its  Children  and  the  Media  Program  have  been 
 engaged  in  issues  of  diversity  and  identity  formation  for  several  years,  and  we  submit  the 
 following  research  reports  to  be  placed  in  the  record  of  this  proceeding:  t4’

 This  body  of  research  presents  a  comprehensive  examination  of  how  America’s 
 young  people  perceive  issues  of  diversity  such  as  race,  class,  and  gender  in  the  broadcast 
 media  that  they  consume.  Children  speak  about  the  lack  of  diversity  and  the  unfair 
 representation  of  minorities  in  the  media.  Further,  many  young  people  express  their 
 desire  for  more  balanced,  realistic,  and  real  programming.  Concurrently,  these  reports 
 also  provide  content  analyses  of  the  most  popular  media  among  young  people,  with 
 respect  to  these  diversity  issues.  While  some  pictures  have  improved,  there  is  still  much 
 room  for  greater  positive  diversity  in  programming. 
 Children  Now  submits  this  body  of  research  into  the  record  and  recommends  that 
 the  FCC  take  note  of  the  findings.  The  voices  of  America’s  children  should  be  included 
 in  this  rule-  making  process.

 . 
 Actors  of  color  playing  guest  roles  or  non- 
 recurring  characters  account  for  much  of 
 prime  time  programming’s  existing  racial 
 diversity. 
 When  examining  &I  the  characters  in  prime 
 time  entertainment  (i.  e.,  all  primary,  secondary, 
 recurring,  and  non-  recurring  roles),  61%  of  the 
 shows  have  diverse,  mixed  casts.  However, 
 when  examining  only  the  recurring  characters, 
 under  40%  have  that  same  mixed  composition. 
 Finally,  looking  only  at  the  characters  in  the 
 ooenina  credits,  only  17%  have  mixed 
 composition.  In  short,  programming  diversity 
 disappears  as  you  focus  on  the  more  important 
 and  central  characters. 


 Almost  half  of  the  shows  on  prime  time  have 
 all  white  casts  in  the  opening  credits. 
 Correspondingly,  many  opening  credits  casts 
 (i.  e.,  primary  recurring  characters)  are  all  white. 
 While  only  16%  of  shows  have  entire  casts  that 
 are  all  white,  that  percentage  increases  when 
 we  look  at  recurring  characters  only  (29%),  and 
 at  ooenina  credits  casts  (48%).  Thus,  the  more 
 central  the  character  is,  the  more  likely  she/  he 
 will  be  white. 


 o  When  the  entire  cast  of  a  show  is  included, 
 all  networks  demonstrate  substantial 
 numbers  of  shows  with  diversity. 
 When  examining  diversity  in  the  set  of  all 
 characters,  there  is  a  range  of  representation 
 across  networks.  UPN  has  the  highest 
 proportion  with  mixed  casts  (80%).  About  2/  3 
 of  the  programs  on  Fox  and  CBS,  and  about 
 half  of  the  shows  on  ABC,  NBC,  and  the  WB 
 feature  mixed  entire  casts. 


 .  Diversity  diminishes  for  all  networks  when 
 focusing  on  recurring  characters  only. 
 Narrowing  the  scope  to  recurrinq  characters 
 only,  the  “Big  Three”  (i.  e.,  ABC,  CBS,  NBC) 
 feature  the  least  riumbei  of  mixed  casts 
 (approximately  i/  3  of  their  shows).  Half  of  the 
 programs  on  the  WB  and  UPN  and  about  43% 
 of  the  shows  on  Fox  feature  a  mix  of  race  and 
 ethnicity  in  their  recurring  casts. 


 l  Opening  credits  casts  are  the  least  mixed 
 and  most  all  white  for  all  networks  except 
 UPN. 
 The  picture  becomes  even  worse  in  the 
 ooenino  credits  casts,  where  all  networks 
 feature  mixed  casts  in  less  than  ‘/  4  of  their 
 shows.  And  while  the  “Big  Three”  continue  to 
 exhibit  significant  white  homogeneity  in  their 
 opening  credits  casts  (e.  g.,  ABC-  56%,  CBS- 
 41%,  NBC-  52%),  other  networks  such  as  the 
 WB  (50%)  and  Fox  (57%)  also  feature  a 
 substantial  numbers  of  all  white  casts.  UPN 
 shows  a  broader  distribution  with  20%  mixed 
 and  20%  all  white. 


 l  Youth  characters  on  prime  time  TV  are  more 
 likely  to  be  white  than  the  overall  TV 
 population. 
 While  America’s  youth  dem&  raphics  are 
 increasingly  diverse,  their  TV  counterparts  are 
 less  so.  Compared  to  the  total  TV  population, 
 youth  characters  are  more  white  (86%  versus  80%). 


 l  Occupations  for  female  characters  polarize 
 between  professional  and  traditional. 
 While  25%  of  female  characters  hold 
 professional  jobs  (i.  e.,  attorneys,  doctors),  there 
 are  also  high  numbers  for  occupations  such  as 
 clerical  and  service/  retail  work. 


 l  Characters  with  a  noticeable  disability 
 (n=  21)  are  equally  recurring  (n=  lO)  and  non- 
 recurring  (n=  l  l),  and  overwhelmingly  white 
 (n=  18). 


 l  Most  openly  gay/  lesbian  characters  on 
 prime  time  TV  are  male. 
 Ninety-  two  percent  of  openly  gay/  lesbian 
 characters  are-  male  (n=  22)  and  all  recurring 


 openly  gay/  lesbian  characters  are  men.

 Children  today  are  growing  up  in  an  era  of  increasing  racial  and  ethnic  diversity.  ’  In  a  1998 
 Children  Now  poll,  over  three  fourths  of  children  reported  having  a  best  friend  of  a  different 
 race.  ’  While  diversity  is  easily  seen  in  many  children’s  lives,  the  question  remains  whether 
 this  diversity  is  reflected  in  television  programming.  Television  is  a  significant  influence,  with 
 children  spending,  on  average,  about  2  hours  a  day  and  20  hours  a  week  viewing  TV.  3 
 Young  people  get  clear  messages  about  racial  and  class  divisions  and  their  own  racial 
 identity  through  the  characters  they  see  in  television  programs.  For  example,  children  see 
 that  media  gives  recognition  and  respect  to  racial  groups  that  are  positively  portrayed.  Yet, 
 when  children  do  not  see  members  of  their  racial  group  on  television,  it  “suggests  that  they 
 are  not  worthy  of  viewers’  attention.“  4  With  the  changes  in  racial  demographics  and  the 
 steady  influence  of  television  media  in  children’s  lives,  an  examination  of  racial  diversity  on 
 television  is  increasingly  important. 


 In  recent  months,  a  debate  between  advocacy  groups,  television  critics,  and  media 
 executives  has  begun  to  take  shape  around  issues  of  diversity  on  television.  The  1999-  2000 
 prime  time  TV  season  became  the  subject  of  considerable  controversy  after  NAACP 
 President  Kweisi  Mfume,  in  a  July  1999  keynote  address,  described  the  new  fall  season  as  a 
 “virtual  whitewash  in  programming”  (Los  Angeles  Times,  7/  13/  99).  The  orgarjzation’s 
 examination  of  26  new  fall  programs  revealed  no  people  of  color  in  any  starring  roles.  TV 
 critics  around  the  country  began  writing  about  diversity  (or  lack  of  it)  in  the  fall  line-  up,  using 
 such  expressions  as  “the  vast  diversity  wasteland,”  (Los  Angeles  Times,  7/  25/  99)  and  “the 
 unbearable  whiteness  of  prime  time;”  (New  York  Times,  g/  26/  99).  Since  the  address,  the 
 NAACP  and  other  groups  have  staged  boycotts  (Washington  Post,  g/  27/  99),  threatened 
 litigation,  circulated  petitions,  accused  networks  of  making  “empty  promises”  (New  York 
 Times,  8/  l  8/  99),  and  hosted  open  forums  (Los  Angeles  Times,  1  l/  30/  99)  to  keep  the  issue  of  minority  representation  (on-  screen  and  off)  alive.  At  the  beginning  of  this  century,  a  few 


 networks  have  begun  to  outline  their  long-  term  plans  for  increased  diversity. 
 To  provide  networks  with  full  information  and  to  track  prime  time  diversity  in  all  its  forms  (e.  g., 
 race,  gender,  disability,  sexuality),  Children  Now  commissioned  the  most  comprehensive 
 study  of  the  prime  time  line-  up  to  date.  Many  media  critics  and  industry  leaders  have  already  acknowledged  the  quantitative  lack  of  diversity  highlighted  by  the  NAACP.  However,  a 


 thorough  examination  must  reach  beyond  numbers  to  analyze  such  substantive  issues  as  the 
 types  of  roles  that  people  of  color  inhabit,  the  ways  in  which  their  characters  are  developed, 


 ’  According  to  the  U.  S.  Census  Bureau  (www.  census.  aov),  the  American  population  as  of  November  1,1999 
 was  approximately:  non-  Hispanic  White  (71.7%),  non-  Hispanic  Black  (12.2%).  non-  Hispanic  American  Indian,  Eskimo,  and  Aleut  (0.7%),  non-  Hispanic  Asian  and  Pacific  Islander  (3.8%),  and  Hispanic  of  any  race  (11.6%). 


 Further,  the  American  youth  population  of  18  years  old  and  under  as  of  July  1,  1998  was  approximately:  non- 
 Hispanic  White  (65.2%).  non-  Hispanic  Black  (14.6%),  non-  Hispanic  American  Indian,  Eskimo,  and  Aleut  (I%), 
 non-  Hispanic  Asian  and  Pacific  Islander  (4%),  and  Hispanic  of  any  race  (15.3%).  All  projections  show  increasing 
 proportions  of  current  minority  groups  and  decreasing  proportions  of  Whites  (U.  S.  Census  Bureau,  Statistical 
 Abstract  of  the  United  Sfates,  1999).

 and  the  story-  lines  in  which  they  appear.  Therefore,  in  the  Summer  of  2000,  Children  Now 
 will  release  the  second  part  of  Fall  Colors-  a  qualitative  examination  of  diversity  in  the 
 content,  character  development,  and  story-  lines  of  selected  casts. 


 Both  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  components  of  Fall  Colors  will  provide  substantial  added 
 value  to  academics,  advocates,  and  the  television  industry  as  an  assessment  tool  that 
 measures  progress  on  diversity  from  year  to  year  and  over  time.  Other  studies  of  on-  screen 
 diversity  (whether  focused  on  race,  class,  gender,  disability,  sexual  identity,  or  age)  have 
 been  conducted  sporadically  and  have  measured  one  particular  season.  The  continued 
 publication  of  Fall  Colors  will  create  an  invaluable  benchmark,  particularly  when  key 
 decisions  are  being  made  during  the  new  season  or  during  pilot/  premiere  season. 


 TV  programming  is  central  to  American  culture.  For  better  or  worse,  its  relentless  images 
 and  messages  shape  our  belief  systems  about  ourselves  and  the  world  around  us.  Now  is 
 the  time  to  look  critically  and  carefully  at  how  and  whether  our  diverse  nation  is  reflected  on 
 television.  It  matters  to  every  segment  of  the  audience,  but  particularly  to  the  youngest  and 
 most  impressionable  consumers  of  mass  media.

 Fall  Colors  introduces  several  innovative  definitions  and  categories  that  provide  a  unique  in- 
 depth  look  at  prime  time  diversity: 


 1.  Character  Role  Type  -  Primary,  Secondary,  Recurrbg,  Non-  Recurring  While  earlier  studies  have  looked  primarily  at  leading  and/  or  supporting  roles,  Fall  Colors 
 categorizes  the  widest  range  of  prime  time  performers,  from  actors  in  the  opening  credits 
 to  guest  stars  and  cameo  appearances  to  background  characters.  5  Characters  are 
 designated  as  primary  (opening  credits  cast,  integral  to  plot)  or  secondary  (not  integral  to 
 the  main  plots),  and  then  further  categorized  as  recurring  or  non-  recurring  (based  on 
 number  of  planned  appearances). 


 For  example,  on  the  top-  rated  program  ER  (NBC),  the  characters  may  be  defined  as: 


 The  value  of  recording  all  of  these  Character  Role  Types  is  the  ability  to  determine  where 
 on-  screen  diversity  occurs  -  i.  e.,  are  characters  of  color  in  primary  recurring  or  secondary 
 non-  recurring  roles?  By  expanding  the  detailed  recording  started  by  the  Screen  Actors 
 Guild,  Fall  Colors  furthers  the  dialogue  on  diversity.  6 


 2.  Program  Diversity  Index  (PDI)  Fall  Colors  looks  for  diversity  at  ,several  levels  such  as:  the  overall  prime  time  line-  up,  the 
 individual  network  line-  up,  and  within  the  television  program  itself.  To  examine  the  racial 
 and  ethnic  diversity  of  a  particular  television  program,  Fall  Colors  created  the  “Program

 Diversity  Index.”  Each  program  was  evaluated  and  labeled  according  to  the  following 
 definitions: 


 l  Note:  In  the  case  of  a  Program  Character  Set  with  only  two  characters,  each  of  a  different  race,  the  %et  is  designated 
 Mixed  rather  than  Only  1. 


 3.  Program  Character  Set  Because  Fall  Colors  categorizes  all  performers  by  Character  Role  Type,  it  is  possible  to 
 measure  specific  sets  of  characters  on  a  particular  television  show.  For  example,  the 
 Program  Diversity  Index  can  measure  what  diversity  is  on  A//  y  McBeal  (Fox)  when  you 
 look  at  the  entire  cast  versus  when  you  look  at  the  main  characters  only.  The  following 
 sets  are  examined  in  this  report:

 l  The  total  prime  time  population  is  mostly  white,  visibly  African  American,  and

 Now  (n=  l477  characters)  ’  reveals  a  prime  time  population  that  is  predominantly  white 
 (80%)  with  a  visible  African  American  presence  (13%)  and  an  under-  representation  of  all 
 other  minority  groups  (each  group  3%  or  less).

 ’  By  recording  all  primary,  secondary,  recurring,  and  non-  recurring  characters  on  274  episodes  of  92  prime  time 
 shows,  Fall  Colors  provides  the  most  comprehensive  sample  of  the  1999-  2000  prime  time  season  to  date;  other 
 recent  studies  have  examined  limited  samples  of  new  premiere  shows  and/  or  leading  cast  members  only.

 0  The  same  distribution  exists  among  leading  roles.  Likewise,  the  racial  distribution  of  Primary  Recurring  characters  (i.  e.,  Opening  Cast 
 Credits  characters)  in  all  shows  airing  from  8  p.  m.  to  11  p.  m.  (PST)  on  the  six  major 
 networks  shows  the  same  pattern.  Approximately  82%  of  these  leading  roles  are  played 
 by  white  actors  and  13.8%  are  played  by  African  Americans.  However,  all  other  minority 
 groups  are  either  severely  under-  represented  (Latinos  -  3%,  Asian  Pacific  Americans  - 
 2%)  or  completely  absent  (Native  Americans  -  0%). 


 l  Racial  diversity  of  characters  is  not  equivalent  across  the  six  networks. 
 When  examining  diversity  of  a//  characters  at  the  network  level,  UPN  featured  the  largest 
 representation  of  nonwhite  characters  (35%),  while  ABC  featured  the  smallest  percentage 
 of  nonwhites  (13%)  followed  by  NBC  (16%),  Fox  (19%),  CBS  (20%),  and  the  WB  (23%). 


 The  racial  mix  changes  only  slightly  when  examining  the  recurring  characters  who  appear 
 on  each  network,  with  characters  of  color  appearing  most  frequently  on  UPN  (36%)  and 
 least  often  on  ABC  (15%).

 In  addition  to  overall  racial  diversity  of  prime  time,  Children  Now  also  examined  the  degree  of 
 racial  diversity  within  each  program.  This  is  largely  in  response  to  how  young  people 
 describe  their  ideal  show  as  one  that  would  not  have  a  cast  of  only  one  race.  As  one  Latina 
 put  it,  “‘  I  think  the  perfect  show  for  me  would  be  a  show  that  had  every  race.  Not  a  show  with 
 only  African  Americans  or  only  Latin0  people  -  [a  show]  that  will  fit  everybody.“  ’  This  section  looks  at  whether  this  kind  of  diversity  is  reflected  in  programming. 


 As  described  earlier,  Children  Now  has  developed  several  definitions  and  categories  that 
 provide  an  in-  depth  analysis  on  the  program  level.  For  each  program,  Fall  Colors  examines 
 three  (3)  sets  of  characters:  Entire  Cast,  Recurring  Characters  Only,  and  Opening  Credits 
 Cast  (i.  e.,  Primary  Recurring  Characters  Only).  Then,  for  each  set  of  characters,  Fall  Colors 
 designates  a  Program  Diversity  Index  label:  All  White,  All  Black,  Only  1,  or  Mixed.  This 
 complex  examination  determines  how  diverse  each  show  is,  and  where  that  diversity  exists. 


 l  The  majority  of  prime  time  television  programs  show  diversity  in  the@  “entire  cast 
 of  characters.”  When  examining  all  the  characters  in  prime  time  entertainment,  Children  Now  discovered 


 that  a  majority  of  the  programs  (n=  56,  61%)  may  be  labeled  “Mixed.”

 However,  if  we  look  only  at  the  sample  of  recurring  characters,  it  becomes  evident  that  the 
 diversity  in  many  programs  comes  in  the  form  of  non-  recurring  or  guest  characters. 
 Limiting  the  sample  to  recurring  characters  only  shows  that  under  40%  of  the  programs 
 featured  a  Mixed  cast  (n=  36),  and  nearly  l/  3  featured  casts  that  were  either  all  white 


 (n=  27)  or  all  Black  (n=  2).

 a  The  sample  of  Opening  Credits  Cast  characters  is  much  less  “Mixed”  and  much  more  “All  White.” 
 Narrowing  the  program  character  set  to  the  Primary  Recurring  or  Opening-  Credits  Cast 
 characters,  the  diversity  of  TV  characters  is  much  less  evident.  Over  half  of  the  programs 
 in  the  sample  (n=  50,  54%)  featured  primary  casts  that  were  either  all-  white  (n=  44)  or  all- 
 Black  (n=  6).  Less  than  one  program  in  five  (n=  16,  17%)  featured  a  cast  of  primary 
 characters  who  were  from  diverse  racial  backgrounds  (i.  e.,  “Mixed”).

 Although  the  distribution  of  all  characters  at  each  network  reflects  varying  degrees  of  diversity 
 (see  Tables  A  &  B),  the  Program  Diversity  Index  provides  a  more  thorough  and  detailed 
 examination  of  diversity.  Using  the  Index  takes  into  account  frequency,  clustering,  and 
 Character  Role  Types,  rather  than  relying  solely  on  numbers.  For  example,  while  a  network 
 may  employ  a  significant  number  of  African  American  actors,  those  actors  might  be  clustered 
 in  a  few  shows  and/  or  relegated  to  minor  roles.  Thus,  the  Program  Diversity  Index  provides  a 
 more  refined  assessment. 


 Further,  some  analyses  have  observed  diversity  on  those  networks  offering  primarily  racially 
 homogenous  shows.  The  Program  Diversity  Index  includes  such  shows,  but  also  includes 
 programs  that  offer  a  mixed  racial  picture.  The  purpose  of  the  Index  is  not  to  criticize  all  white 
 or  all  Black  shows,  or  to  exclusively  promote  all  Mixed.  There  are  particular  production 
 values  and  necessities  associated  with  homogenous  shows,  ranging  from  realistic 
 geographic/  demographic  representations  to  positive  portrayals  for  historically 
 underrepresented  groups.  Rather,  the  goal  is  to  work  toward  a  more  positive  balance  of  &I  of 
 these  types  of  shows  across  the  networks. 


 l  When  the  entire  cast  of  characters  is  included,  all  networks  demonstrate 
 substantial  diversity.  When  examining  diversity  in  the  set  of  all  characters,  there  was  a  range  cif  representation 


 across  networks.  UPN,  for  example,  had  the  highest  proportion  of  programs  with  Mixed 
 casts  (8  of  IO).  Approximately  2/  3  of  the  programs  on  Fox  and  CBS  featured  Mixed  casts. 
 About  half  of  the  programs  on  ABC,  NBC,  and  the  WB  featured  M.  ixed  casts. 


 However,  looking  at  the  proportion  of  homogenous  programs,  it  is  clear  that  NBC  and  the 
 WB  aired  the  highest  proportion  of  programs  with  all  white  or  all  Black  casts  (nearly  ?4  of 
 each  network’s  offerings).  These  programs  do  not  feature  a  single  person  of  another  race 
 or  ethnicity  as  primary  or  secondary  characters.

 ABC,  CBS,  NBC)  feature  the  least  number  of  Mixed  casts.  The  chart  below  details  the 
 program  diversity  for  each  network,  when  only  the  recurring  casts  of  the  programs  were

 Mixed  casts.  Half  of  the  programs  shown  on  the  WB  and  UPN  feature  Mixed  recurring 
 casts,  and  approximately  40%  of  Fox  programs  were  identified  as  having  Mixed  recurring

 programs  feature  either  all  white  or  all  Black  primary  characters.  Even  networks  like  the 
 WB  and  UPN,  which  feature  the  greatest  representation  of  non-  white  characters, 
 maintained  substantial  homogeneity  in  their  programs’  opening  credits  casts.  Nine  of  14 
 programs  aired  on  the  WB  (64%)  and  five  of  ten  programs  shown  on  UPN  (50%)  were

 The  types  of  programs  in  which  racial  groups  are  likely  to  appear  can  affect  how  a  group  is 
 perceived.  For  instance,  many  African  American  television  characters  have  long  been 
 criticized  as  being  stereotypically  “goofy”  characters,  always  providing  a  laugh  or  comic  relief. 
 Examining  racial  data  by  program  genre  -  comedy,  drama,  sci-  fi  -  provides  a  qualitative  look 
 at  the  persistence  of  these  and  other  stereotypes. 


 Examining  racial  diversity  across  different  program  types,  African  American  characters  of  all 
 types  -  primary  or  secondary,  recurring  or  non-  recurring  -  appear  most  frequently  in 
 situation  comedies.  More  than  half  of  the  African  American  characters  sampled  appeared  in 
 situation  comedies.  Latin0  and  Asian  characters  are  more  than  twice  as  likely  to  appear  in 
 dramas  as  situation  comedies,  The  small  number  of  Native  American  characters  (n=  3)  was 
 spread  out  across  genres.  Examining  the  racial  representation  in  different  program  genres 
 for  characters  that  are  part  of  the  recurring  casts  of  prime  time  programs  reveals  the  same 
 patterns:

 Similar  to  the  findings  of  several  studies,  including  the  Screen  Actors  Guild’s  landmark  study,  g 
 the  gender  balance  of  prime  time  characters  is  not  consistent  with  the  actual  gender 
 breakdown  of  the  population.  According  to  the  U.  S.  Census  Bureau,  women  make  up  51%  of 
 the  total  population.  Yet,  in  the  landscape  of  television,  women  are  largely  underrepresented, 
 comprising  only  38%  of  all  prime  time  characters  (n=  559).

 s  Marital  status  was  more  obvious  for  female  characters  than  for  male  characters.  Seventeen  percent  of  recurring  female  adult  characters  and  30%  of  recurring  male  adult 
 characters  were  coded  as  having  “unknown”  marital  status.  These  data  suggest  that 
 marital  status  is  more  important  to  female  characters’  identities  than  it  is  to  male 
 characters’  identities. 


 Further,  18%  of  recurring  adult  females  and  15%  of  adult  male  recurring  characters  were

 The  most  likely  question  asked  of  a  new  acquaintance  is  ‘What  do  you  do?”  and  the  answer 
 will  probably  factor  heavily  in  an  instant  assessment.  Occupation  telegraphs  education, 
 social  status,  even  worth.  To  identify  oneself  as  a  doctor  or  executive  signals  greater  status 
 than  a  blue  collar  worker  or  unskilled  laborer  connotes.  Casting  for  occupation  sends  an 
 equally  strong  message.  Who  are  seen  in  the  prestigious  jobs?  Which  jobs  do  women  and 
 minorities  hold?  And  when  criminals  and  the  underclass  are  cast,  are  long  held  stereotypes 
 perpetuated?  A  15-  year  old  Latina  said,  “When  /  do  see  Latinos  come  out  in  shows,  they 
 usually  come  out  as  gangsters,  as  being  bad  people.  people,  going  to  school,  having  a  career.  “I0  They  never  show  us  as  being  good

 White  primary  characters  tend  to  be  higher  status  than  nonwhite  primary  characters  -  more 
 professionals  and  CEOs.  Nonwhite  characters  overall  are  more  highly  represented  than 
 whites  in  service-  related  occupations  like  law  enforcement,  teaching,  nursing.  Nonwhites  are 
 not  often  shown  as  CEOs  or  executives  in  large  corporations,  but  are  shown  as  small 
 business  owners  (i.  e.  on  Moesha  (UPN),  Moesha  Mitchell’s  father,  Frank,  owns  a  car 
 dealership;  on  The  Hughleys  (ABC),  Daryl  Hughley  owns  his  own  business).  The  following

 Due  to  the  low  numbers  of  Asian  Pacific  American  and  Latin0  prime  time  characters,  the

 l  Gender  and  Occupations 
 Approximately  one  quarter  of  all  female  adult  characters  are  identified  as  holding 
 professional  occupations  (i.  e.  lawyers  and  physicians),  similar  to  the  proportion  for  male 
 characters.  The  women  who  are  not  doctors  and  lawyers  often  work  in  occupations  such 
 as  clerical  and  service/  retail  positions.

 “Wow,  there’s  no  people  like  me.  ,,”  For  young  people,  the  population  of  youth  characters  on  prime  time  television  may  be  particularly  important  because  it  supposedly  represents  their 
 demographic.  When  children  watch  television,  what  types  of  kids  are  they  seeing  and  how 
 well  does  the  picture  reflect  America’s  increasingly  diverse  reality? 


 l  Youth12  make  up  12%  of  the  total  sample  (n=  l64). 
 Seventy  percent.  of  the  youth  characters  (n=  115)  are  part  of  the  main  casts,  and  more 
 than  half  are  secondary  characters  (n=  91,  55%). 


 l  Youth  characters  aie  slightly  more  likely  to  be  white  and  female  than  the  overall  TV 
 population.  Forty-  six  percent  of  the  youth  characters  are  female,  and  86%  are  white.

 A  very  small  proportion  of  the  sample  was  identified  as  having  a  noticeable  disability. 
 Twenty-  one  characters  (1.4%  of  total  sample)  displayed  some  sort  of  disability,  and  these 
 characters  were  about  evenly  split  between  recurring  and  non-  recurring  roles  (n=  lO  recurring! 
 n=  l  1  non-  recurring).  Characters  with  disabilities  were  overwhelmingly  white  (n=  18). 
 Examples  of  recurring  characters  with  disabilities  are:  Dr.  Kerry  Weaver  on  ER  (NBC)  who 
 uses  a  cane  to  help  her  walk;  Jake,  a  newsstand  proprietor  on  Becker(  CBS)  who  is  blind; 
 and  Eli,  a  high  school  student  on  Freaks  and  Geeks  (NBC)  who  is  mentally  challenged. 


 A  very  small  proportion  of  the  sample  was  identified  as  openly  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  or 
 transgender  (LGBT).  Twenty-  four  characters  (1.6%  of  total  sample),  most  of  them  playing 
 recurring  roles,  were  identified  as  homosexual  or  bisexual,  Males  make  up  92%  of  the  LGBT 
 population  (n=  22).  All  of  the  recurring  gay  characters  on  prime  time  are  male;  most  are 
 white.  Examples  of  recurring  gay  characters  are:  Will  Truman,  a  lawyer  on  Will  and  Grace 
 (NBC);  Wayne  Vincent,  a  high  school  drama  teacher  on  Popu/  ar(  WB);  and  Jack  McPhee,  a 
 high  school  student  on  f3awson’s  Creek  on/  B).

 Today,  Hollytiood’s  creative  community  continues  to  struggle  with  the  complicated  issues  of 
 diversity,  generating  strategies  such  as  “grafting”  additional  characters  of  color  (San 
 Francisco  Examiner,  l/  5/  00),  holding  wider  casting  calls  for  fall  2000  (New  York  Times,  g/  20/  99),  designing  creative  job  infrastructure  for  minorities,  and  purchasing  from  minority- 


 owned  businesses  (AP  Online,  l/  5/  00).  Highlighted  by  the  NAACP’s  awareness  campaign, 
 this  conversation  has  been  marked  by  a  variety  of  voices,  from  top  executives  defending  their 
 commitment  to  diversity  to  conc,  erned  artists  seeking  fundamental  decision-  making  changes 
 to  minority  organizations  calling  for  boycotts. 


 Yet  still  more  voices  must  be  heard.  The  nation’s  young  people  are  consuming  television 
 images  in  steadily  increasing  numbers  and  will  soon  comprise  the  largest  audience  for  every 
 network.  It  is  their  hearts,  minds,  and  souls  that  are  the  most  telling  and  most  vulnerable  to 
 the  power  of  this  medium. 


 The  world  of  prime  time  broadcast  television  does  not  reflect  the  diversity  that  is  apparent  in 
 the  world  outside  the  screen,  particularly  the  world  of  children.  Men  outnumber  women 
 almost  two  to  one,  There  are  fewer  Latinos,  Asian  Pacific  Americans,  and  Native  Americans 
 than  in  the  general  population,  especially  among  the  youth  characters.  Prime  time  has  made 
 a  little  room  for  white  characters  with  disabilities  and  white  men  who  are  gay. 


 And  when  programming  does  include  people  of  color,  it  frequently  does  so  in  an  exclusionary 
 manner.  The  Program  Diversity  Index  -  measuring  the  level  of  diversity  within  individual 
 programs  -  shows  that  most  programs  feature  primary  casts  that  are  either  all  white  or  all 
 Black.  Racial  diversity  in  today’s  prime  time  comes  in  the  form  of  secondary  and  guest 
 characters. 


 These  patterns  of  representation  are  more  than  just  predictable  year-  to-  year  statistics. 
 Young  people  are  affected  by  what  they  see,  sometimes  even  more  by  what  they  don’t  see. 
 Children  of  all  races  asserted  that  it’s  important  to  see  people  of  their  own  race  on  television 
 because,  “it  tells  children  that  people  of  their  race  are  important,  n  ‘2  makes  children  of  that 
 race  feel  included,  “and  “it  provides  role  models.”  Absence  can  tell  you  that  minorities  “shouidn  Y  be  seen.“  13 


 So  how  do  we  answer  the  young  Latina  who  remarks,  “Wow,  there’s  no  people  like  me?“  or 
 the  Native  American  boy  who  says  that  he  see  Native  American  kids  on  TV  “once  every  blue 
 moon  ?“  14  As  Hollywood  takes  steps  toward  creating  a  more  inclusive  and  realistic  picture  of  today’s  world,  it  is  crucial  that  positive  changes  are  sustained.  Toward  that  end,  Children 


 Now  will  continue  to  talk  to  young  people  and  to  provide  networks  with  the  best  information  possible  with  each  year’s  Fall  Colors.

 l  Could  a  person  of  color  play  this  leading  character?  This  recurring 
 role? 


 l  Can  a  secondary  character  of  color  develop  into  a  more  significant 
 role? 


 l  Does  this  character’s  development  avoid  oversimplified 
 representations  of  racial  minorities? 


 8  Do  the  people  of  color  and  women  in  the  cast  have  a  diversity  of 
 occupations  that  includes  management,  educational,  and  other 
 positive  positions?  c. 


 m  Does  the  cast  present  mostly  Black  and/  or  white?  Does  the  cast 
 reflect  today’s  multicultural  society  that  is  comprised  of  many  races, 
 ethnicities,  and  combinations  ? 


 B  Did  we  balance  the  negative  roles  in  this  script  among  different 
 ethnicities?  Who  is  playing  the  criminal,  the  clown,  the  cheater? 


 B  Are  we  paying  attention  to  the  roles  and  diversity  of  children  in  prime 
 time  shows?  Children  watch,  listen,  and  learn  from  the  screen.

 This  study  examined  the  first  three  episodes  of  each  prime  time  entertainment  series  airing  in 
 Fall  1999  on  the  six  broadcast  networks.  15  “  Entertainment  series”  was  defined  as  scripted 
 fiction  programming  in  a  serial  format.  The  sample  did  not  include  sports  programming,  news 
 magazines,  game  shows,  made-  for-  TV  movies  or  specials.  Programs  in  the  sample  aired 
 between  8  -  11  p.  m.  PST  Monday  through  Saturday  and  7  -  lIp.  m.  PST  Sunday.  Since  the 
 project  focused  on  1999  series  programming,  only  first  run  episodes  were  recorded. 


 All  content  was  subjected  to  two  levels  of  analysis: 
 l  Macro-  level  analysis  which  examined  such  program  characteristics  as  genre,  rating,  and  cast  diversity. 
 .  Micro-  level  analysis  which  identified  each  primary  and  secondary  character  and  examined  such 
 characteristics  as  gender,  race,  occupation,  marital  status,  and  sexual  orientation.  Characters  were 
 identified  as  primary  or  secondary  if  they  were  necessary  to  the  plot  of  any  of  the  three  episodes. 


 All  content  was  coded  by  the  author/  researcher  (Katharine  E.  Heintz-  Knowles,  Ph.  D.)  and 
 four  other  trained  coders.  To  ensure  reliability  among  coders,  ten  percent  of  the  sample  was 
 coded  by  each  of  the  coders  independently.  The  percent  of  agreement  between  coders  was 
 calculated.  All  variables  included  in  this  analysis  received  a  level  of  agreement  of  at  least 
 94%. 


 This  method  of  data  collection  yielded  1477  characters  across  274  episodes  of  92  different 
 programs.  A  list  of  the  programs  sampled  is  included  in  Appendix  A.  Sixty-  two  percent  of  the 
 sample  is  male  (n=  918);  38%  female  (n=  559).  A  majority  of  characters  sampled  were  part  of 
 the  recurring  casts  of  programs  (n=  848,  57%).  Most  of  the  characters  in  the  sample  played 
 secondary  roles  (n=  887,  60%). 


 l5  Due  to  scheduling  changes  and  cancellations  by  networks,  the  sample  contains  just  two  episodes  of  some  of 
 the  programs  included.
