	<p>Ask EPA is an online interactive forum where you can discuss a wide range of environmental and human health issues with EPA's senior officials.</p>
    <h2>Today's Session</h2>
    <p><img src="../images/slj.jpg" alt=" EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson" width="80" height="100" class="left" style="padding-right:5px" /> Administrator
      Stephen L. Johnson leads EPA&rsquo;s efforts to protect human health and
      the environment, managing more than 17,000 Agency employees nationwide
      and overseeing an annual budget of $7.2 billion. Administrator Johnson
      will discuss EPA's efforts to promote clean and dependable energy solutions,
      including the <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=cal.showPledge">Change
    a Light Campaign</a><a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/12F488843651A3DD852573690051BBD6"></a>. </p>
    <p style="clear:left;">&nbsp;</p><hr />
    <p><strong>Administrator Johnson</strong>: Welcome, and thank you for joining
      me for the inaugural session of &ldquo;Ask EPA.&rdquo; &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
      had the opportunity to participate in &ldquo;Ask the White House&rdquo; several
      times, so I am very excited by the interest and response to this forum.&nbsp; And
      since we&rsquo;re currently at 120 questions and climbing, I want to begin
      by apologizing if I don&rsquo;t have a chance to reply to everyone during
    our hour together.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>As stated, today&rsquo;s discussion will focus on EPA&rsquo;s role in
      promoting clean energy solutions.&nbsp; I, as well as other senior EPA
      officials, look forward to holding this forum on a regular basis to address
      the many, many other issues covered by this Agency. </p>
    <p>Well, enough with the introductions &ndash; let&rsquo;s get to your questions.&nbsp;</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Doris<br />
          <strong>In</strong>: Manchester, MI<br />
            <strong>Question</strong>: Is this &quot;Light Campaign&quot; in our schools? I think it is a
great campaign that our young children can get involved in. Everyone understands
how our children can pressure parents, grandparents, aunt and uncles to do something
that the child is passionate about. I would help to bring it to our schools if
needed. <br />
</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
      Thanks for the question. </p>
    <p>At EPA, we have a saying &ndash; &quot;Environmental responsibility is
      everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.&quot;  There are a number of ways we are
      working with our schools and children. And during our Energy Star bus tour,
      we helped teach young Americans that protecting the environment is as easy
      as changing a light. Fortunately, the message is getting out there. </p>
    <p>For example, during the national bus tour, we stopped outside of Atlanta,
      Georgia, to spend time at Durham Middle School. During that visit, we met
      with the students and teachers who have pledged to change out more than
      5,500 light bulbs in their homes. We&rsquo;re encouraging all schools to
      teach the benefits of energy efficiency, so that students go home and persuade
      their families to check out <a href="http://www.energystar.gov">www.energystar.gov</a>.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From:</strong> Paul<br />
          <strong>In</strong>: Denver, CO<br />
      This is a great forum, thank you for offering this. <br />
      <strong>Questions</strong>: <br />
      1.) Is the topic for this Thursday limited to only the stated topic, or
      will questions on other environmental topics be fielded?<br />
      2.) How frequently will these forums be held and how will the topics be
      assigned?<br />
      3.) Is the 3:00 p.m. start time = 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time zone? <br />
      <br />
      Thank you,<br />
      Paul<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
      Thanks for your interest in this forum, Paul. Maybe your questions would
    have been the best place to start.</p>
    <p>&quot;Ask EPA&quot; is a unique and great opportunity to ask senior Agency
      officials questions on a wide range of environmental and human health issues.
      As I mentioned, today I am focusing on clean and dependable energy. However,
      we will be inviting future &quot;Ask EPA&quot; hosts to discuss the diverse
    environmental topics they deal with in their day-to-day jobs. </p>
    <p>Our hope is to hold these online chats every other week, so I encourage
      you to keep checking EPA&rsquo;s homepage. And, yes, we will be sure to
      be clearer about the start times. There&rsquo;s a reason I volunteered
      to go first &hellip; to get all the bugs out of the system!</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Jerry<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: 
      Milwaukee, WI<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: Has the EPA made any estimates of the emission reductions that have
  come from the many and varied &quot;voluntary&quot; programs that seem to
    play an important role in the agency's environmental improvement strategy?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson:</strong><br /> 
      That's a great question. We have numerous examples of environmental
      benefits achieved through our voluntary programs, including Energy Star,
      Performance Track, and Methane to Markets. Just last year alone, the Agency&rsquo;s
      voluntary climate change efforts prevented an estimated 100 million metric
      tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That&rsquo;s equal to the annual CO2
      emissions from more than 60 million vehicles, 3x the number of cars in
      the entire state of California.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Dave<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Chicago<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: Given that global warming is the biggest environmental
      and socio-economic threat facing our nation and the world, is EPA actively
      endorsing and pushing the White House to support global warming legislation
      calling for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to try to mitigate
      the most severe climate change impacts? If not, why not? If not, isn't
      that a failure to meet EPA's primary mission of protecting the health and
      welfare of our nations citizens?    </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
    While Congress debates the issue, EPA, with the President's leadership, is
      taking action. To date, the Bush Administration has invested $37 billion
      in climate change science, technology and tax incentive programs - more
      than any other country in the world. In addition, by the end of this year
      EPA will be proposing to regulate GHG emissions from cars.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Kaylee<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Odessa, FL<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: Lately, I've been doing a lot of research on
      saving energy and promoting a healthier environment and in my reading I
      found a wonderful machine. Apparently, it's very new technology. Its function
      is to sort all trash bags that are placed into it--by category. Each trash
      bag is categorized by color. Items are sorted accordingly-plastics, glass,
      paper, etc.. From the sorting process they can they go on to be recycled.
      Basically, it takes care of the recycling process that people often do
      not. It does it for people. Not that people should withdraw from their
      recycling, but this sure makes the earth a more efficient place. I was
      thinking how this would work wonders in the waste plants everywhere! It
      could completely change things. I saw the machine is already being used
      in some places. Hopefully, it will make its way into all waste plants.
    Thanks for listening</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson:<br />
    </strong>We are encouraging everyone to recycle and I too am impressed by new technologies
    that make it easier.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Rebecca<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Tampa, FL<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: I would love to drive a hybrid, but I can't
      afford it. What efforts are you making to promote the use and availability
    of vehicles that use alternative, sustainable fuel rather than gas? </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      Under the President's leadership, our nation has invested an incredible
      amount of effort in developing new technologies. As these technologies
      move from the laboratories to the streets, our expectation is that costs
    will continue to go down.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Felicia<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Atlanta, GA<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: I am hearing a lot about Green Roof from the
      private sector which I think is an awesome idea. Will EPA play a big part
    in participating in this?  </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L.  Johnson</strong>: <br />
      I agree this is a growing industry. As a matter of fact, this past year
      EPA had a green roof installed at our regional office in Denver. I also
      recently signed a memorandum of understanding with several communities
      that promotes the use of green roofs, green infrastructure, green pavements
    and sustainable water practices.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: David<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Region 2<br />
    <strong>Question</strong>: How many EPA folks does it take to change a light
    bulb? Although I framed the question in the traditional joke format, I am
    sincerely asking how many folks does EPA have committed to this very worthwhile
    and apparently successful endeavor?    </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      That&rsquo;s an excellent question &ndash; and one I didn&rsquo;t know
      off the top of my head, so we quickly phoned one of our experts. Turns
      out, the Energy Star program, which is actually a joint venture between
      EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, is staffed by 65 personnel. So it&rsquo;s
    not a huge program, but it has a tremendous reach. </p>
    <p>Today, that little blue Energy Star label can be found on more than 50
      different kinds of products and buildings. And more impressively, last
      year, Energy Star helped Americans save about $14 billion on their energy
      bills, while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those
      of 25 million vehicles. So, it&rsquo;s with the help of people like you,
      David, that we are getting Energy Star products off the store shelves and
      into people&rsquo;s homes, businesses and schools around the world. </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Wendell<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Joliet, IL<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: I WANT TO REPORT A VIOLATION AT MY WORK PLACE
    BUT MY EMPLOYER SAID I WOULD GET FIRED.</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L.  Johnson</strong>: <br />
      Even though I said we would limit today&rsquo;s discussion, I want to quickly
      answer this important question. EPA takes environmental enforcement very
      seriously, and we&rsquo;ve set up a Web page where people, who like you
      may be reluctant to report a violation, can do so anonymously. Please fill
    out the information we need to begin an investigation at, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/tips/">www.epa.gov/tips/</a>.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Michelle<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Humble, TX<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>:  If deregulation of the electricity market
        was supposed to drive competition (and potentially lower energy prices
        via the free market) why did my electric bill jump from $350/month (2
        story, 4K square foot house, 2 AC units at 80 all the time in the summer)
        to over $700/month?!  </p>
    <p>I have: installed 2 feet of new insulation side to side/front to back
      in the attic, put in radiation heat barrier in the attic, put in new ridge
      vents, put in all energy efficient bulbs in the house (85+ I might add!),
      insulated every light and electrical switch, caulked every window twice
      and replaced old door seals, tinted south and west facing windows....what
      else can I possibly do????!!!!!! My electric is still well over $500/month.
      Thanks, M</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      EPA does not oversee the electricity market, we make sure that when energy
    is produced it meets our environmental and public health standards.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Ben<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Washington, DC<br />
    <strong>Question</strong>: Can the EPA increase the renewable fuels standard
    without more congressional approval?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      Yes. EPA is drafting a regulation now that would use the President's 20
      in 10 plan as a starting point. Renewable and clean alternative fuels are
    a critical part to achieving our regulatory goals.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Leetie<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Northern VA<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: Why, when EPA wants to promote clean energy
        solutions, is it holding up the decision to allow California (and eleven
        other states to follow) to enforce stricter emissions standards? Wouldn't
        that prompt auto manufacturers to move forward on better and cleaner
        technology? Wouldn't that make a significant and swift impact on greenhouse
    gases in the environment?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      EPA is following the legally mandated process for evaluating California's
      petition and doing so in an expeditious yet responsible way. My commitment
      to Governor Schwarzenegger is to finish the analysis and make a decision
    by the end of the year.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Glen<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Artemas, PA<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: Why doesn't the Change a light campaign clearly
        state the potential hazards of eyestrain, mercury, and UV light associated
        with CFLs thus allowing participants to make informed choices of where
    to use them? </p>
    <p>Pennsylvania allows burning of household trash, used CFL bulbs will be
      burned (and release mercury), along with everything else where burning
      is allowed. In many rural PA areas, burning is completely uncontrolled
    presently (the limited existing regulations have no effective enforcement).</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      Energy Star light bulbs have many advantages over traditional incandescent
      light bulbs. So we encourage consumers to make informed decisions regarding
    the disposal of CFL bulbs, please go to our web site for additional information.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Mike<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Denver, CO<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: By proposing to regulate GHGs from motor vehicles
        by the end of the year, do you mean that EPA will develop its own bill,
        or will it support one being developed in the current Congress, or will
    it propose amendments?</p>
    <p> What does that mean about EPA's decision
        to approve a waiver for California regarding LEV requirements in light
    of the Chrysler Jeep cases in California &amp; VT?    </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      While we would prefer the President's &quot;20 in 10&quot; legislative
      proposal, we are taking steps administratively to put a regulation in place
      by the end of 2008 using his plan as a starting point. By the end of the
      year, we will have a proposal for the public to comment on. As I have commented
      before, we are committed to answering the California waiver question by
    the end of the year.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Kevin Donovan<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Leesburg, VA<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: What percentage of appliances sold in the
    U.S. every year are EnergyStar compliant?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      The sales of Energy Star qualified appliances ranges greatly from between
      15% to 55%. For example, I&rsquo;m told that clothes washing machines are
      around 25%, while dishwashers are as high as 46%. But of course, I&rsquo;m
      hoping that by the time my grandchildren are shopping for appliances, those
      numbers will be 100%!<br />
    P.S. I love all of the Energy Star appliances in my home.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Sterling<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Honolulu, HI<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: Last year California passed the &quot;Vampire
      Slayers Act&quot;, a law that requires electronic products to be labeled
      with the amount of energy they use when they're &quot;off&quot; or in &quot;standby&quot; mode.
      It has been estimated that a nickel out of every dollar spent on electricity
      goes toward this kind of unnecessary and excessive electrical consumption.
      Does the EPA support expansion of their &quot;Energy Star&quot; program
      to include this additional information, especially because basis of the &quot;Energy
      Star&quot; program is to provide consumers with a product's energy conservation
    information?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      My understanding is that this technology could be applied to a wide range
        of products to reduce &quot;vampire&quot; electricity use. Energy Star
        encourages the continued development of innovative energy technology.
        The great news is that consumers are driving this demand.</p>

    <p><strong>From</strong>: Craig Voros<br />
      <strong>In</strong>: Fort Wayne, IN<br />
      <strong>Question</strong>: I applaud EPA's commitment to reducing energy
      use in our homes, but what options are you providing for safe disposal
    of the CFLs this campaign is promoting?</p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>: <br />
      As with all products, we encourage
      people to recycle or properly dispose of them, including CFLs. Please see
    our <a href="http://www.epa.gov/bulbrecycling/">Web
    site</a> for opportunities to recycle.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: Pat<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Bethesda<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: When will EPA act on the California waiver
        to help us all to have clean air from car emissions. 11 other States
        are waiting. Why delay so long that it forces the State to go to Court
        to have you act?    </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
EPA is currently reviewing the more than 100,000 written comments and thousands
  of pages of technical and scientific documentation received during the public
  comment period. I have told Governor Schwarzenegger I will make a final determination
  on the waiver request by the end of the year.    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>From</strong>: James<br />
        <strong>In</strong>: Houston, TX<br />
        <strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Johnson,<br />
        As you know Houston is now a Non-attainment area, however I have been
        driving a Plug-in Hybrid in Houston for the past six months. The additional
        battery pack is made up of 20 sealed lead acid batteries that are up
        to 98% recyclable. I buy wind energy to charge my car every night at
        one a.m. My car operates as an electric vehicle in my neighborhood where
        my family lives, and in downtown Houston, a major U.S. City. That means
        I contribute no tailpipe emissions while driving below 34 mph, and very
        little emissions at freeway speeds. My best trip home I averaged 160
        mpg, and on weekends much of my travel is pure electric travel. Effectively,
        I have offset most of my foreign oil use, with domestic wind energy.
        This is good for our national security, our environment, our economy,
    and our lungs.</p>
    <p>Sir, what can the EPA do to mandate or help in mandating free tolls, free
      parking, and one person travel on HOV lanes nationwide for these low emission
      vehicles over the next five years? These requirements would have to be
      granted to both electric vehicles as well as converted hybrids with a battery
      pack that can store at least three kilowatts of energy, and that can maintain
      posted speed limits. </p>
    <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
      EPA does not have legal authority over tolls and HOV restrictions. But,
      take a look at the 2008 fuel economy window sticker. I've recently updated
      a 25 year old methodology for calculating the standard more accurately
      so American motorists can be confident that fuel economy estimates more
    closely reflect today's real world driving experiences.</p>
    <p>Thanks for investing in energy efficient transportation and technology!</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>From</strong>: Gordy Hoffmann<br />
            <strong>In</strong>: Menomonie, WI<br />
            <strong>Question</strong>: Administrator Johnson,
            My question is why can't our governments over the years since the
            Nixon presidency require the U S auto industry to build high mileage,
            efficient pollution free automobiles. They have tried since the nixon
            presidency and nothing has prevailed accept the advent of the SUV!
            Now Japan has taken over the industry and the US industry is crying
            for help. Can US auto management be so myopic? I also think that
            the money you are going to spend driving a large motor coach across
            the country could be better spent. As a citizen of this country it
            sounds more like a wonderful vacation for you and your staff and
            think about the pollution you will cause!<br />
    Thanks for your response.</p>
        <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
          EPA is developing regulations that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
          by improving fuel economy and increasing the supply of renewable, clean
          alternative fuels. Cleaner fuels are the next step in our steady march
    toward energy security, cleaner air and healthier lives.        </p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>From</strong>: Sarah<br />
            <strong>In</strong>: Washington, DC<br />
            <strong>Question</strong>: The EPA currently offers ENERGY STAR programs
            targeting a wide variety of building types including, but not limited
            to, offices, supermarkets, hospitals, schools, and even single-family
            homes. What plan does the EPA have to create a program that addresses
            the energy performance of the multi-family housing industry including
            both existing buildings and new construction regardless of their
            height? When might this program be available and would it include
            a benchmarking component? When can we expect to have an ENERGY STAR
    labeling program for multi-family buildings?</p>
        <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
          You&rsquo;re correct &ndash; right now only smaller multi-family buildings
          can be ENERGY STAR qualified. However, we are currently looking at
          a number of energy efficiency approaches for high-rise residential
          buildings over three stories. A pilot study is expected to last until
    2009, and then we will evaluate the best way to move forward.        </p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>From</strong>: Kim<br />
            <strong>In</strong>: New Orleans, LA<br />
            <strong>Question</strong>: Will EPA support expansion of nuclear
    energy plants as source of clean energy?</p>
        <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
          Nuclear must be part of our clean energy toolbox. But our toolbox needs
          to also include clean coal, wind, solar, etc. As I&rsquo;ve said before,
          innovative technology is the key to unlocking a cleaner energy future,
    and so we must continue to invest in new technologies like hydrogen.        </p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>From</strong>: Bob<br />
            <strong>In</strong>: California<br />
            <strong>Question</strong>: Why do you, the government, not look at
            the whole energy life cycle when promoting a technology, from who
            the energy is produced, how it is transported, how it is used, and
    any waste generated in the process?</p>
        <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
          A great question! I&rsquo;m pleased to report we are currently evaluating
          (scientifically, economically, etc.) the use of a life cycle approach
    for dealing with certain pollutants.        </p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Stephen L. Johnson</strong>:<br />
          I appreciate you all for taking the time to join me today, and thanks
          for your great questions. </p>
        <p>Even for focusing on just one topic, we had a lot to cover. To read
          more about our clean energy initiatives, I encourage you to look around
          EPA&rsquo;s web site, and join me &ndash; and well over 1 million others &ndash; in
          taking the Energy Star &ldquo;Change a Light Pledge&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.energystar.gov">www.energystar.gov</a>. </p>
        <p>Finally, I want to invite you to join us again next Thursday at 2
          pm. Deputy Administrator Marcus Peacock will discuss how EPA measures
          the agency's performance, finds new ways to deliver environmental results
          and his new blog &quot;Flow of the River.&quot;  You can submit a question
          to Marcus on EPA&rsquo;s home page. </p>
        <p>Thanks again, and I hope you all have a great day. </p>
