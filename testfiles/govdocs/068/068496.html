<b>CARROT</B><br><I>Daucus carota</I> L., family Umbelliferae 

<P>Carrots were grown on 78,530 acres in the United States in 1969, with
a farm value of $82,967,000. The seeds, about a million pounds, were produced
on about 2,000 acres, primarily in California, Idaho, and Oregon (Whitaker
et al. 1970). </P>

<P><B>Plant: </B>

<P>When grown for seed (fig. 62), two methods may be employed. If the seed-to-seed
method is used, the seeds are planted in the late summer, the root overwinters
in the soil, and the following year the growth produces a seed crop. In
the root-to-seed method, the roots or stecklings are removed from the soil
in the fall, stored at 33 deg F until the following spring, then transplanted,
and the seed crop is harvested from the plant in the fall. In both instances,
the crop is grown in rows and cultivation is necessary. Franklin (1948)
concluded that proper storage of stecklings was the greatest single problem
in carrot seed production. </P>

<P><B>Inflorescence: </B>

<P>The inflorescence, typical of the umbelliferae, consists of a terminal
or primary compound umbel of white flowers, 5 to 6 inches across, and a
system of second-, third-, and fourth-order umbels, named in relation to
their appearance on the plant below the primary umbel. The umbels decrease
in size as the order number increases. The first and fourth order umbels
are of little importance in seed production (Borthwick 1931). The individual
flower is usually perfect (Knuth 1909*, p. 502), although Braack and Kho
(1958) reported that a tendency to produce only male flowers occurs and
with increasing frequency in the umbels of high orders. A flower normally
has five functional stamens and two styles, which lead to the two locules
of the ovary. Each locule contains a single ovule, thus two seeds per flower
from flowers in a room free of harmful insects and supplied with flies
to pollinate the flowers.</P>

<P>Nectar is secreted from a swollen disk on the upper surface of the ovary
and is easily available to all types of insects. Pellett (1947*) reported
that 100,000 to 150,000 pounds of honey is produced from carrots annually,
but its quality is poor. Carrot pollen is attractive to numerous insects
(Bohart and Nye 1960). Gary et al. (1972) showed that carrot blossoms were
much more attractive to honey bee pollen collectors than onion blossoms,
as only 7 percent of the visitors to onion flowers were collecting pollen
compared with 66 percent of the visitors to carrot blossoms. Flowering
extends over about a month, and dehiscence within an umbel covers about
7 days. Within a floret, the anthers dehisce over a 1-to 2-day period,
the stigma receptivity begins on the third or fourth day. The stigma may
remain receptive a week or possibly longer ( Hawthorn and Pollard 1954*,
Hawthorn et al. 1960, Franklin 1953, Poole 1937).</P>

<P><B>Pollination Requirements:</B>

<P>Jones and Rosa (1928*) and Enzie (1943) stated, without supproting data,
that carrots were &quot;mostly insect- pollinated.&quot; Rather thorough
studies of carrot pollination were made by Hawthorn et al. (1960) (fig.
63). By comparing production from open plots with that from plots caged
(a) to exclude all insects, (b) to exclude all but tiny insects, or (c)
to enclose a colony of honey bees, they proved that insect pollinators
were essential for commercial seed production. In cages excluding all insects,
an averae of only 128 pounds of seed per acre was produced. When tiny insects
were permitted to visit the flowers 453 pounds of seed per acre developed,
open plots exposed to pollinators in the area yielded 711 lb/acre. Hawthorn
et al. (1960) concluded from their close studies of the 'Red Core Chantenay'
cv. that &quot;limited but significant opportunity existed for self-pollination
from one umbellet to another by jarring or wind action, and a greater opportunity
( on a time basis) for cross- pollination by accidential rubbing together
of umbels on adjacent plants.&quot;</P>

<P>However, their test established that such self or mechanical pollination
in the absence of pollinating insects was of little value in the comercial
production of seed. Slate (1927) concluded that only about 15 percent of
the carrot plants set seed from their own pollen. Even though apparently
only two pollen grains are essential in the fertilization of the two ovules
of the flower, and the stigma is receptive to pollen either from flowers
of the same plant or from others for as much as a week, Paci (1956), Pankratova
(1957), and Hawthorn et al. (1960) concluded that there is sufficient transfer
of such pollen without pollinating insects. Thompson (1962) reported that
more than 95 percent crossing occurred in the field at Ithaca, N.Y., but
he gave no indication as to the pollinating agents.</P>

<P>The value of hybrid vigor in carrots has been known for years (Poole
1937) and male sterility, essential in its utilization, was reported shortly
thereafter (Welch and Grimball 1947), but only a few hybrids have been
produced commercially. Whitaker et al. (1970) stated that the uniform,
smooth, highly colored roots produced by superior hybrids cannot be duplicated
by the open-pollinated varieties. However, hybrid carrot seed production
is so recent that time has not permitted the identification of problems
that might be involved in providing adequate cross-pollination for this
crop. The relatively long flowering period of carrots is favorable and
so is the attractiveness of both the nectar and pollen to a broad spectrum
of pollinators, particularly honey bees. For large-scale production of
seeds, however, where male-sterile plants are used, there is need for pollinating
agents interested only in nectar collection that will freely cross over
from the normal to the male-sterile flowers and effect maximum cross-pollination.

<P><B>Pollinators: </B>

<P>Associated with the studies made by Hawthorn et al. (1960) on the need
for insect pollinators, Bohart and Nye (1960) also studied the insect visitors
to carrot flowers. They collected on the carrot blossoms 334 species of
insects representing 71 families, which in itself shows the attractiveness
of these blossoms to a wide variety of insect visitors. Most of the species
of visitors were in the superfamily Apoidea, or the Ichneumonidae, Psammocharidae
(Pompilidae), Sphecidae, and Vespidae families of the Hymenoptera, and
the Bombyliidae, Sarcophagidae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae, and Tachinidae
families of the Diptera. Bohart and Nye (1960) proposed an efficiency rating
for the insect pollinators of carrots, based on the amount of loose pollen
on the insects' body, the size of the insect, and its activity on the flower
head. By multiplying this rating figure by the numbers of insects observed
on the flowers, a pollination index was obtained for each species. </P>

<P>They concluded that several genera in the Apoidea were important pollinators
of carrots, but from the practical standpoint the honey bee was the only
species that could be manipulated and utilized in commercial seed production
(fig. 64). </P>

<P>Pankratova (1958) reported that the chief pollinators of carrots near
Moscow were flies (90 percent) and bees (9 percent). No mention was made
of the number of honey bee colonies in the area nor the plant competition.
</P>

<P>The activity of honey bees on carrot blossoms was studied by Bohart
and Nye (1960). They stated that pollen collecting honey bees &quot;literally
wade across the heads, swinging their abdomens back and forth and scraping
the pollen from stamens with their forelegs. The nectar collectors stand
higher on the flowers, move about less, and lap up droplets from the exposed
nectaries. In other species of bees, the females usually behave like pollen-collecting
honey bees and the males like nectar-collecting honey bees.&quot; </P>

<P>Hawthorn et al. (1960) reported that plants caged to exclude pollinating
insects apparently reached their peak of bloom a few days earlier and held
it more than a week longer than plants in the open or in cages where bees
were present. This difference, however, was attributable to the dislodging
of petals by bees and was only an &quot;illusion&quot; so far as actual
flowering was concerned. </P>

<P>As shown earlier by Hawthorn et al. (1960), bees increased production
of carrot seed. As a result of the bee activity, there were fewer undesirable
large seed and they matured more rapidly and germinated better than seeds
produced where the pollinator level was low. Also, progressive shrinkage
in weight of seeds, which following the various cleaning processes, was
accelerated with every decrease in pollination level. Both quantity and
quality of carrot seeds are improved by high levels of bee pollination.
Franklin (1970) reported that at one time in Parma, Idaho, the carrot fields
were teeming with bees, and excellent seed crops were obtained. Then pest
control methods and materials changed, competitive crops moved in, bee
counts dropped, and the seed crops failed.</P>

<P><B>Pollination Recommendations and Practices: </B>

<P>As a result of their studies Bohart and Nye (1960) made the following
recommendations: &quot;(1) Locate enough colonies of honey bees in the
area to provide effective populations on the flower heads; (2) avoid the
presence of competing bloom; (3) restrict plantings of carrots for seed
to avoid dilution of the pollinator population; (4) choose areas with varied
habitats capable of supporting large numbers of a wide variety of pollinators;
(5) take steps to increase populations of wild pollinators in the area.
For most large seed-producing areas a combination of the first and second
methods is likely to prove the most practical.&quot; </P>

<P>Hawthorn et al. (1960) gave a little more indication as to the number
of pollinators needed. They stated, &quot;Under the cultural conditions
of our experiments, a honey bee population of 8 per square yard (the lowest
average number for the season in our cages) is apparently as high as the
plant can use to advantage. Probably a somewhat smaller number would do
just as well, although we have no direct evidence to support such a conclusion.&quot;
</P>

<P>Pankratova (1957) stated that the most reliable pollinators of carrots
are honey bees. He recommended transporting colonies to the field, but
the number of colonies was not mentioned. Hawthorn et al. (1956) also recommended
movement of colonies of honey bees to carrot fields to provide the large
numbers necessary at flowering time but did not designate the number. Naturally,
the number needed would be influenced by competition from other flowers,
the strength and condition of the colonies, and the attractiveness of the
carrot flowers. Under most conditions where carrots are grown for seed
and maximum production is desired, the placement of several colonies per
acre in and around the field would probably be justified. Eight bees per
square yard of flowers should be striven for regardless of the number of
colonies required to provide this. </P>
