              is a chitin-synthesis inhibitor and causes death in insects during 
              the molting process (van Daalen et al. 1972, Post and Vincent 1973). 
              Chitin, a nitrogenous polysaccharide, is the organic foundation 
              of the exoskeleton of all insects and the entire phylum Arthropoda 
              (Snodgrass 1935). Therefore, some concern exists that widespread 
              use of diflubenzuron may affect not only the target insect pest 
              but also nontarget arthropods that are essential for the diversity 
              and stability of rangeland ecosystems. Other studies have shown 
              the potential of diflubenzuron against rangeland grasshoppers (Foster 
              et al. 1991 unpubl. and 1993 unpubl.). </font></font> </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">Our key research objective was to determine whether diflubenzuron 
              negatively affected the abundance and diversity of nontarget arthropods 
              (including ants, spiders, predatory beetles, and pollinator bees) 
              in rangelands, and if so to determine if the effect was greater 
              than the effect of one of the current standard treatments. Another 
              research objective was to develop additional data on the potential 
              of diflubenzuron as an alternative insecticide against rangeland 
              grasshoppers.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">Previous studies indicate that diflubenzuron spares most nontarget 
              arthropods. Ables et al. (1975) reported diflubenzuron to be harmless 
              to a pupal parasitoid of the house fly. Compared to dimethoate-treated 
              poultry farms in North Carolina, diflubenzuron-treated farms had 
              greater parasitoid abundance and species diversity. In cotton fields, 
              Keever et al. (1977) observed that arthropod predators belonging 
              to orders Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and Neuroptera were not affected 
              by diflubenzuron when it was sprayed aerially at 0.12 lb active 
              ingredient (AI) per acre (0.14 kg AI per hectare). Wilkinson et 
              al. (1978) evaluated various rates and formulations of diflubenzuron 
              on adult and immature stages of selected parasitoids and predators 
              found in cotton fields. The authors found test insects to be unaffected 
              by diflubenzuron even at high concentrations except for immatures 
              of a lacewing species.</font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">In contrast, diflubenzuron may be detrimental to some freshwater 
              crustaceans and immature aquatic insects (fig. VII.3-1). Miura 
              and Takahashi (1974, 1975) observed temporary population reductions 
              in tadpole shrimp, clam shrimp, water fleas, copepods, cladocerans, 
              mayfly naiads, and midge larvae in treated (0.1 lb AI per acre) 
              mosquito breeding areas in California. Adult aquatic beetles, spiders, 
              and mosquito fish were not affected by diflubenzuron even at the 
              highest rates tested. Farlow et al. (1978) studied the impact of 
              diflubenzuron on nontarget organisms of a Louisiana coastal marsh. 
              Those authors reported significant reductions in amphipods, dragonfly 
              naiads, nymphs of corixid and notonectid bugs, as well as adult 
              hydrophilid beetles in marshlands treated six times with 0.025 lb 
              AI per acre (28 g AI per ha) over an 18-month period. On the other 
              hand, significant increases were observed among mayfly naiads, larvae 
              of noterid and dytiscid beetles, adult corixid bugs, and mosquito 
              fish. Numerous immature and adult insects were listed as unaffected 
              by the diflubenzuron treatments.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">The environmental fate and degradation of diflubenzuron in a laboratory 
              model ecosystem, a soil bacterium, sheep liver microsomes, and ultraviolet 
              light were investigated by Metcalf et al. (1975). They found diflubenzuron 
              to be moderately persistent in organisms such as algae, snails, 
              caterpillars, and mosquito larvae but efficiently degraded by mosquito 
              fish, however. Ecological magnification may not be a problem: the 
              lowest concentration of diflubenzuron was found in the mosquito 
              fish, at the top of the model food chain. Sheep liver microsomes 
              and the soil bacterium were not able to degrade diflubenzuron under 
              the experimental conditions imposed.</font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">Other studies have shown the potential of diflubenzuron against 
              rangeland grasshoppers. Foster et al. (1991 unpubl.) reported aerial 
              treatments of diflubenzuron spray at 0.015, 0.030, and 0.045 lb 
              AI per acre to reduce second- and third-instar grasshoppers as well 
              as a standard treatment of carbaryl (0.5 lb AI per acre) after 1 
              week. Foster's team showed reductions for all treatments in 
              the range of 94 to 96 percent after 2 weeks. Under simulated control 
              program operational conditions, Foster et al. (1993 unpubl.) reported 
              two formulations of diflubenzuron at 0.0156 AI per acre and a carbaryl 
              standard performed equally well (control ranged from 87 to 91 percent).

              were compared with Sevin&#174; 4-Oil (0.5 lb AI/acre) and untreated 
              plots. The lower rate of Dimilin 2F was evaluated only for efficacy 
              against grasshoppers. The remaining treatments were evaluated for 
              impact on nontarget arthropods <i>and </i>efficacy against grasshoppers. 
              We used a completely randomized design with each treatment replicated 
              four times. A fixed-wing airplane applied chemical treatments over 
              40-acre plots from July 2 to July 7, 1993. </font> </p>

              nontarget arthropods (ants, spiders, predatory beetles, and scavenger

              jar filled with approximately 4 inches of mineral oil. Each pitfall 
              trap was buried so that the opening was flush with the soil surface. 
              The oil killed and temporarily preserved crawling insects that fell 
              into the traps. Six pitfall traps spaced 15 ft apart and arranged 
              in hexagonal pattern were installed near the center of each 40-acre

              made of nylon screen that intercepted and directed flying insects

              treatment application. Traps were maintained continuously thereafter, 
              and catches were collected at weekly intervals for 10 weeks from 
              July to September. Plot and trap location markers remained onsite 
              over the winter months, and an additional sample was collected about 
              1 year after treatment. We took grasshopper counts from rings and 
              sweep-net samples (fig. VII.3-3) once before chemical treatment 
              and at weekly intervals for 7 weeks after treatment. Additional 
              grasshopper counts and samples were taken the end of season (11 
              weeks after treatment).</font></p>

              or pollinator). Identification of ants to the species level (Wheeler

              </b>There were four major groups of soil surface-associated arthropods: 
              (1) ants (order Hymenoptera: family Formicidae), (2) spiders (order 
              Araneae: families Agelenidae, Amaurobiidae, Clubionidae, Dictynidae, 
              Gnaphosidae, Hahniidae, Lycosidae, Mimetidae, Philodromidae, Salticidae,

              Meloidae, and Staphylinidae), and (4) scavenger beetles (order Coleoptera: 
              families Scarabaeidae, Silphidae, and Tenebrionidae).</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">In terms of biological function on the rangeland ecosystem, ants 
              may be regarded as both general predators and scavengers (Wheeler 
              and Wheeler 1963). All spiders are predators (Kaston 1972). Beetles 
              belonging to families Carabidae (ground beetles), Cicindelidae (tiger 
              beetles), Staphylinidae (rove beetles), and Histeridae (hister beetles) 
              are also general predators (Borror and DeLong 1964). Blister beetle 
              (Meloidae) larvae feed on grasshopper eggs, but adults are considered 
              pests of certain crops. Scavengers were composed of families Scarabaeidae 
              (scarab beetles), Silphidae (carrion beetles), and Tenebrionidae 
              (darkling beetles). Certain scarabs like the dung beetle feed on 
              cattle manure; carrion beetles feed on dead animal carcasses. Darkling 
              beetles feed on decaying plant materials but some, like the false 
              wireworms, feed on the roots of wheat and are considered pests. 
              All arthropods mentioned above are important components of the rangeland 
              food chain because they are potential food for vertebrate animals 
              like birds, frogs, mice, moles, and shrews. </font> </p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">In general, Dimilin 2F (0.015 lb AI/acre), Dimilin 25W (0.015 lb 
              AI/acre), and Sevin 4-Oil (0.5 lb AI/acre) did not significantly 
              reduce the number of ants, spiders, predatory beetles, or scavenger 
              beetles from 7 to 76 days after treatment (DAT). Even at 1 year 
              after treatment (350 to 357 DAT), no significant reductions in any 
              of the soil surface-associated arthropods were detected. Ant numbers 
              temporarily (49 to 55 DAT) declined after Dimilin 2F and Sevin 4-Oil 
              treatments by 43 and 56 percent, respectively. The temporary decline 
              in ant numbers.VII.3-4 may or may not be due to chance alone. What 
              is important is that ant numbers rebounded immediately and that 
              in most of the sampling periods, the Dimilin and Sevin treatments 
              were consistently shown to have no detrimental effects on ant numbers. 
              Additionally, ant diversity (based on PIE calculations) was not 
              significantly affected by the Dimilin or Sevin treatments from 7 
              to 357 DAT. This result may indicate that no ant species was particularly 
              susceptible to the Dimilin and Sevin treatments at the dosages studied.</font></p>

              Dimilin 25W reduced predator numbers during the 15- to 20-DAT period 
              by 59 percent. Predator numbers subsequently recovered, and in most

              was recorded in the Dimilin 2F treatment at 35 to 41 DAT. No significant 
              reductions were observed in the number of pollinator bees. About 
              1 year after treatment (350 to 357 DAT), no significant reductions

              grasshopper species were present on the 800-acre experimental area 
              immediately before spraying (0 DAT). <i>Melanoplus sanguinipes </i>F.,<i> 
              M. infantilis </i>Scudder, and <i>Trachyrhachys kiowa </i>Thomas 
              were the dominant grasshopper species. Grasshopper age structure 
              was 46.8, 24.6, 23.5, 3.7, 0.2, and 0.1 percent for 1st, 2rd, 3rd, 
              4th, and 5th instars and adults, respectively, at 0 DAT. This age 
              composition was ideal for a chitin-synthesis inhibitor like Dimilin 
              because the majority of grasshoppers had several molts remaining 
              in their life cycle.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">All Dimilin treatments were comparable to Sevin 4-Oil starting 
              at 14 DAT. From 14 DAT to 49 DAT, grasshopper numbers in the Dimilin- 
              and Sevin-treated plots were significantly lower than those of the 
              untreated plots. Dimilin provided consistent grasshopper control 
              from 14 DAT to 49 DAT; Sevin-treated plots revealed temporarily 
              elevated grasshopper numbers at 35 DAT and 42 DAT. No differences 
              between plots treated with Dimilin at different rates or formulations 
              were detected after 14 DAT.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dimilin was not as effective as Sevin at 7 DAT. This delayed response 
              is most likely due to its mode of action. Dimilin exerts its effect 
              at molting while Sevin (a cholinesterase inhibitor) acts at any 
              time of development. Grasshopper population reductions (adjusted 
              for natural population changes) in Dimilin-treated plots ranged 
              from 65 percent to 90 percent from 14 DAT to 49 DAT. In this study, 
              all treatments lost effectiveness against grasshoppers by 76 DAT.

			<font face="Verdana" size="-1">In summary, our study showed that Dimilin and Sevin sprays did 
              not appear to significantly reduce the abundance of soil-surface-associated

              control in rangeland. Our observations extended only through about 
              1 year after treatment. Interpretation of our results is limited
