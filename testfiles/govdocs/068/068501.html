      <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText">Alfalfa is the most commonly grown crop in California 
        with 1 million acres per year and hay production of nearly $1 billion 
        per year (number one valued field crop). Several insect pests injure alfalfa 
        fields and reduce crop yields and quality. The alfalfa weevil complex, 
        comprised of the Egyptian alfalfa weevil (EAW), <em><em>Hypera brunneipennis</em></em> 
        and alfalfa weevil, <em><em>Hypera postica</em></em>, is the most damaging 
        arthropod in California alfalfa. Weevil larvae are well-controlled with 
        insecticides primarily organophosphates and carbamates. However, the occurrence 
        of organophosphate insecticides in surface waters, particularly chlorpyrifos 
        (Lorsban&reg;) and diazinon, coinciding with the timing of treatment for 
        EAW larvae, has placed added emphasis on finding alternative means to 
        manage this pest. Pyrethroid insecticides and indoxacarb were recently 
        registered in alfalfa but have drawbacks of being non-selective for natural 
        enemies and only marginally cost-effective, respectively. These insecticides, 
        particularly pyrethroids, are not without their environmental concerns 
        as well. Therefore, it appears that alternative, refined measures are 
        needed for EAW management in alfalfa in California. A considerable amount 
        of work was done on alfalfa pest management in the 1980's and before in 
        California, but research efforts have waned during the last 15 years for 
        various reasons including competing priorities, funding limitations, etc. 
        Through this project, we propose to re-establish an alfalfa research program 
        by re-evaluating the status of biological control of EAW larvae and studying 
        the EAW treatment threshold under current production practices. Ten parasitoid 
        species were released in CA for EAW from 1957-1988 and three were reported 
        as established, but incidence of these organisms has not been studied 
        recently. Observations by Godfrey in 2002 and 2003 indicated relatively 
        high natural mortality of EAW larvae at one study site. The second area 
        that could facilitate EAW management in California is a re-evaluation 
        of treatment thresholds for EAW under the current production regime. </p>
      <h4>Objectives </h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Monitor Egyptian alfalfa weevil larval populations in California 
          alfalfa fields and determine incidence of naturally-occurring mortality 
          agents.</li>
        <li> Re-assess the treatment threshold for Egyptian alfalfa weevil larval 
          populations in California alfalfa fields under current production practices.        </li>
        <li> Extend results to growers through appropriate field days, symposia, 
          newsletter articles, etc. </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Justification</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Objective 1. </strong>Alfalfa 
        is the most commonly grown crop in California with approximately 1 million 
        acres per year and hay production of nearly $1 billion per year (number 
        one valued field crop). Much of the alfalfa hay goes to support the milk 
        and dairy industry in the state which is the number one agricultural commodity 
        (in gross value) produced in California. Several insect pests injure alfalfa 
        fields and reduce crop yields and quality. The alfalfa weevil complex, 
        comprised of the Egyptian alfalfa weevil (EAW), <em>Hypera brunneipennis</em> 
        and the alfalfa weevil, <em>Hypera postica</em>, is the most damaging 
        arthropod pest of alfalfa in most areas of California. In the Central 
        Valley of California, intermountain areas, and coastal areas (comprising 
        over 80% of the alfalfa acreage), these weevil larval pests damage the 
        first alfalfa cutting of the production year from February to June (depending 
        on location in the state). Aphids, including spotted alfalfa aphid, blue 
        alfalfa aphid, pea aphid and a recent pest, the cowpea aphid, damage the 
        second cutting alfalfa in March to July. Host plant resistance is used 
        to partially manage the first two of these aphid species, but naturally-occurring 
        biological controls, i.e., lady beetles, lacewings, etc., are imminently 
        important for aphid management. Lepidopterous larvae (beet armyworm, alfalfa 
        caterpillar, and others) move into alfalfa and are significant pests during 
        the summer and early fall months. An insecticide application per cutting 
        cycle is not uncommon to control these worm pests. Biological control, 
        primarily wasp parasitoids, is also important in fields unperturbed by 
        insecticides for controlling these pests. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0">Management of the alfalfa 
        weevil, being the first insect pest of the season, often highly influences 
        the management actions in an alfalfa field for the entire year. If biological 
        control of aphids and lepidopterous larvae is upset with insecticides, 
        consequences of this often persist throughout the season. The alfalfa 
        weevils are well-controlled with insecticides; organophosphate and carbamate 
        materials have been applied for several years for this purpose. In fact, 
        in 2001, four of the most commonly used six insecticides in alfalfa were 
        either an organophosphate and carbamate material (#1=chlorpyrifos, #4=dimethoate, 
        #5=methomyl, #6=carbofuran) and 50% of all applications were of materials 
        from these two insecticide classes. However, the occurrence of organophosphate 
        insecticides in surface waters, particularly chlorpyrifos (Lorsban&reg;) 
        and diazinon, coinciding with the timing of treatment for Egyptian alfalfa 
        weevil has placed added emphasis on finding alternative means to manage 
        this pest. New regulations (http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pressrls/april10.htm) 
        have recently been released primarily aimed at ground water but surface 
        waters are also a concern in California (http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/sw/surfdata.htm). 
        The federal Clean Water Act and CA Dept. of Pesticide Regulation actions 
        are mandating changes in pesticide use patterns through TMDL and other 
        criteria (Prichard 2002). Pyrethroid insecticides (Warrior&reg;, Mustang&reg;, 
        Baythroid&reg;, and others) have recently been registered in alfalfa and 
        effectively control EAW. Long et al. (2002) demonstrated the fit of pyrethroid 
        insecticides for this use and the positive attributes for reduction in 
        run-off in irrigation tailwater. These insecticides, however also have 
        their associated environmental concerns, and also have the additional 
        consideration of having broad-spectrum activity and destroying populations 
        of beneficial organisms in alfalfa. These natural enemies are very important 
        in alfalfa for the management of aphids and lepidopterous larvae. Recently, 
        indoxacarb was registered for use in alfalfa; EAW control at cost-competitive 
        rates is moderate to good but appears to be less than with organophosphate 
        and carbamate insecticides. Therefore, it appears that alternative, refined 
        measures are needed for EAW management in alfalfa in California. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText">A considerable amount of work was done with biological 
        control of the alfalfa weevil pests starting in the 1930's and was highlighted 
        by the release of ten separate hymenopterous species from 1957-1988. The 
        later years of this work were part of the National Alfalfa Weevil Biological 
        Control Project, ARS and APHIS phases. The goal was to establish a suite 
        of parasitoids that would positively impact populations of alfalfa weevil 
        larvae in California as has occurred in the northeastern and midwestern 
        U.S. (Kingsley et al. 1993, White et al. 1992). Evaluations done in CA 
        in the 1980's (Kingsley et al. 1993, Pitcairn and Gutierrez 1989) showed 
        establishment of three species of parasitoids but only at low levels. 
        I am unaware of more recent surveys to ascertain the status of biological 
        control of EAW in California. One of us (Godfrey) conducted studies on 
        efficacy of registered and experiential insecticides against EAW in 2002 
        and 2003. Larval populations were slow to develop and never exceeded the 
        exceeded threshold value for treatment even though fields were located 
        in areas with known severe EAW pressure. Several larvae were observed 
        in a sluggish, discolored state and larval mortality appeared high. The 
        reasons for this mortality were not determined. It is hypothesized that 
        a biological agent (parasitoid) or fungal disease could be exerting an 
        effect on the population. This could be an important, unrealized control 
        agent of EAW and if more information was available this could entice growers 
        to reconsider treatment or at least more closely evaluate the population 
        before treatment. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"><strong>Objective 2</strong>. The second area that 
        could facilitate EAW management in California and could perhaps reduce 
        insecticide usage is the area of treatment thresholds for EAW. The published 
        threshold of 20 larvae per sweep (http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r1300511.html) 
        is dated and growers lack confidence in this threshold. One obvious criticism 
        of this threshold is that it is static, whereas it should float according 
        to hay values (which vary significantly from $70 to $170 per ton) and 
        with costs of controls. If insecticides are the primary control option, 
        it is unrealistic to say they have not changed in price over the last 
        30 years, the tenure of this threshold. In addition, alfalfa cultivars 
        and production practices have changed significantly since this threshold 
        was developed in the 1970's. </p>
      <h4>Overall Summary</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Alfalfa fields, as a short-term 
        perennial agroecosystem, support a wide range of arthropods, most of which 
        have neither positive nor negative effects on the crop. van den Bosch 
        and Stern (1969) estimated approximately 1000 species of arthropods in 
        the typical alfalfa field in California. These organisms contribute to 
        the biodiversity of agricultural systems. A few of these insects can be 
        significant competitors with the crop for resources and as such can reduce 
        yields. As in many systems, the most important alfalfa insect pests were 
        accidentally introduced from other countries. The alfalfa weevil complex, 
        Egyptian alfalfa weevil (EAW), <em>Hypera brunneipennis</em> and the alfalfa 
        weevil, <em>Hypera postica</em> was introduced from the Mediterranean 
        region/Mideast area on three separate occasions; 1904 near Salt Lake City, 
        1939 near Yuma, AZ, and 1951 near Annapolis, MD (Radcliffe and Flanders 
        1998). The designation of these insects as two species has been under 
        debate (see Hsiao and Hsiao 1985), but there are some biological/behavioral 
        differences that suggest speciation. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText">Biological control efforts against these pests by 
        U.S. agencies began in 1911 when the insect was still in Europe. Isolated 
        efforts were undertaken in Utah in the 1920's, California in the 1930's, 
        Arizona in the 1940's and the northeastern U.S. in the 1950's (Radcliffe 
        and Flanders 1998). As the complex became a nation-wide pest, USDA coordinated 
        biological control efforts and millions of parasitoids from approximately 
        10 species were released. These organisms adapted quickly in the northeastern, 
        midwestern, north central U.S. In fact, in the northeast, weevil populations 
        declined within 10 years of the releases (Day 1981) and insecticide use 
        on alfalfa dropped 73% (Radcliffe and Flanders 1998). White et al. (1995) 
        showed economic benefits of $2,200,000,000 to producers in the northeast, 
        which was 25 times the cost of the program. However, in other regions, 
        the parasitoid species released were less effective. Kingsley et al. (1993) 
        and (Radcliffe and Flanders 1998) reported that insecticide usage on alfalfa 
        through the 1980's in the West was unaffected by the program. Some additional 
        releases were done in California in the 1980's (new species or strains 
        better adapted to western conditions). Pitcairn and Gutierrez (1989) summarized 
        the history of these releases and stated that three species had established 
        in CA. The larval parasitoids Bathyplectes curculionis, B. anurus, and 
        Tetrastichus incertus were reported as "widely established", "recently 
        recovered", and "established central California", respectively from the 
        1982-83 surveys. Systematic, more recent studies have not been done in 
        order to re-evaluate the incidence of these organisms. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-top: 0;">The economic threshold is 
        central to any integrated pest management system. Lacking this threshold 
        value, or lacking a reliable, grower accepted value, management efforts 
        resort to preventative treatments. Koehler and Rosenthal (1975) published 
        results of work supporting a threshold of 20 per sweep for EAW. The threshold 
        has been effectively used for numerous years such that an insecticide 
        application prior to the first cutting for EAW is routine in the Central 
        Valley. The research in the 1970&#8217;s assumed hay values of $50-$70 
        per ton and treatment costs of $6-8 per acre (these values are approximately 
        doubled in today&#8217;s alfalfa economy). In addition, alfalfa cultivars 
        such as &#8216;Lahontan&#8217;, &#8216;El Dorado Improved&#8217;, and 
        Caliverde 65&#8217; were used in this study; these are not grown to any 
        extent in the Central Valley today. First harvest yields averaged about 
        2500 lbs/A in this work conducted in the 1970&#8217;s whereas yields today 
        for the first harvest are commonly 4000-4500 lbs/A. </p>
      <h4> Approach and Outcomes</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <strong>Objective 1.</strong> 
        Naturally-occurring biological control will be assessed in several areas 
        of the state. Kuhar et al. (1999, 2000) reported on similar efforts conducted 
        in Virginia. Studies will be conducted in four areas of the Central Valley 
        (from south to north - Bakersfield, Fresno, Davis, and Willows) and one 
        intermountain location (Yreka). Two approaches will be used. The first 
        will evaluate the incidence of biological control from about 10 fields 
        per location. Near the time of peak larval population (but before insecticide 
        treatment), 200 EAW larvae will be collected per field and held in the 
        laboratory on alfalfa bouquets at room temperature. Parasitoid cocoons 
        will be collected and any larva dying will be assayed for fungal conidia 
        or resting spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Zoophthora phytonomi. 
        These data will allow us to evaluate the incidence of biological control 
        in several areas of the state. For the second approach, two fields per 
        area (the intermountain area will be excluded from this aspect) will be 
        sampled every 10-14 days starting in January and continuing through EAW 
        pupation (about May). EAW adults and larvae will be collected from sq. 
        ft. samples of alfalfa foliage; specimens will be dislodged from the clipped 
        stems and counted. Eggs will be recovered by the blender - flotation method 
        of Pass and Van Meter (1966) and quantified. Pupae (at the appropriate 
        time) will be enumerated by counting the number per sq. ft. samples (pupae 
        are often on the soil surface). Recovered adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae 
        will be held in the laboratory for natural enemy expression (although 
        larval parasitoids are apparently most common some parasitoids of the 
        egg, adult, and pupae stages have been released). The densities, timing, 
        and mortality of all life stage will be summarized. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Objective 2.</strong> 
        Plots will be established on the UC-Davis campus for this objective. Two 
        approaches will be used. Separate plots will be treated for EAW at 5-7 
        day intervals as the larval population builds for a total of five timings; 
        the final treatment will be untreated. An effective EAW product such a 
        Warrior will be used. For the second approach, five insecticide treatments 
        (plus an untreated) will be used. The goal is to establish a gradient 
        of EAW larval populations near the time of the peak population. Warrior 
        (3.8 oz./A), Lorsban 4E (2 and 1 pt./A), Steward SC (2.6 and 1.3 oz./A) 
        will be used. The goal is not to compare insecticides but rather to remove 
        various percentages of the EAW population. Each treatment timing or treatment 
        insecticide will be replicated four times and plots (20 x 50&#8217; each) 
        will be in a randomized block design. EAW larval populations will be quantified 
        in each plot every 7 days using the standard sweep net sampling method. 
        Plots will be harvested and yields and nutrient quality (% crude protein, 
        % IVDDM) will be determined. Based on current hay prices, an economic 
        analysis will be conducted. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"><strong>Objective 3</strong>. Results will be extended 
        to growers through newsletter articles, the UC Alfalfa Workgroup, the 
        Alfalfa Symposium which attracts ~500 participants annually, the Annual 
        Alfalfa Field Day in May, and other appropriate outlets.</p>
      <h4> Impact Assessment</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The one-year tenure of this project will make it 
        difficult to assess impacts. However, I believe if good information is 
        developed on the availability of biological control of EAW and on treatment 
        decision/timing, unnecessary applications will decrease and this will 
        promote protection of the water resources. Over time, a positive impact 
        will be incurred. Our intention is to pursue additional funding and to 
        extend the project for a second year, which will make the results more 
        robust. </p>

      <h4>Major Participants</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Larry Godfrey, Extension Entomologist/Entomologist in Agricultural 
          Experiment Station, Dept. of Entomology, Univ. of California-Davis<br />
          Godfrey will coordinate the project and advise the GSR on the day-to-day 
          operations the project. He will provide laboratory and greenhouse facilities 
          as well as environmental chambers, computers and other needed equipment. 
        Godfrey has responsibilities for IPM of field crops. </li>
        <li> Dan Putnam, Agronomist and Cooperative Extension Specialist, Dept 
          of Agronomy and Range Science, Univ. of California-Davis<br />
          Putnam as the state-wide Alfalfa Agronomy Specialist will provide expertise 
          on alfalfa production issues. He will assist with yield and nutrient 
          quality evaluations. Putnam annually sets up Field Days and organizes 
          the other key outreach efforts in alfalfa. He is active in environmental 
          and political issues that could impact alfalfa production in CA. He 
          is active in the California Alfalfa and Forage Association (CAFA) which 
        represent producers in the state.</li>
        <li> Univ. of California Cooperative Extension Farm Advisors will be involved 
          to liaison with growers in the counties. Steve Orloff (Yreka), Rachael 
          Long (Davis), David Haviland (Bakersfield) have active programs in alfalfa 
          and grower contacts in the alfalfa industry. With the large number of 
          grower fields involved in the study (~50), growers have not been selected 
          yet but the key personnel are in place to do so. All the personnel in 
          this project have worked with alfalfa growers previously, so getting 
          access to fields should be achievable. </li>
