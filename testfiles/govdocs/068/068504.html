Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of&nbsp;
Endangered Status for Blackburn's Sphinx Moth from the Hawaiian Islands

AGENCY:&nbsp; Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION:&nbsp; Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:&nbsp; We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine&nbsp;
Manduca blackburni, the Blackburn's sphinx moth, to be an endangered&nbsp;
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).&nbsp;
Historically, this species occurred on the Hawaiian islands of Kauai,&nbsp;
Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, but until

[[Page 4771]]

recently, was known only from one population on Maui. Researchers&nbsp;
observed a second population on Maui in 1992, and populations are now&nbsp;
known to also occur on the islands of Kahoolawe and Hawaii. This moth&nbsp;
is currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat&nbsp;
fragmentation and destruction due to development and agricultural&nbsp;
practices resulting in the loss of its host plants, habitat degradation&nbsp;
due to the effects of introduced animals and plants, predation,&nbsp;
parasitism, competition for food or space by alien insects, and&nbsp;
overcollection by private and commercial collectors. Due to its&nbsp;
restricted distribution, this species is also vulnerable to extinction&nbsp;
from random, catastrophic events, such as drought or fire. This final&nbsp;
rule implements the Federal protections provided by the Act for this&nbsp;
moth.

EFFECTIVE DATE:&nbsp; March 2, 2000.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hawaiian archipelago includes eight large volcanic islands&nbsp;
(Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii), as&nbsp;
well as offshore islets, shoals, and atolls set on submerged volcanic&nbsp;
remnants at the northwest end of the chain (the Northwestern Hawaiian&nbsp;
Islands). Each island was formed sequentially from frequent, voluminous&nbsp;
basaltic lava flows (Stearns 1985). The youngest island, Hawaii, is&nbsp;
still volcanically active, and retains its form of coalesced, gently&nbsp;
sloping, unweathered shield volcanoes (broadly rounded dome-shaped&nbsp;
volcanoes formed by fluid and far-spreading lava flows). Vulcanism on&nbsp;
the older islands has long since ceased, with subsequent erosion&nbsp;
forming heavily weathered valleys with steep walls and well-developed&nbsp;
streams and soils (Department of Geography 1983).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This range of topography creates a great diversity of climates.&nbsp;
Windward (northeastern) slopes can receive up to 1,000 centimeters (cm)&nbsp;
(400 inches (in)) of rain per year, while some leeward coasts that lie&nbsp;
in the rain shadow of the high volcanoes are classified as deserts,&nbsp;
receiving as little as 25 cm (10 in) of rain annually. This climate has&nbsp;
given rise to a rich diversity of plant communities, including coastal,&nbsp;
dryland, montane, subalpine, and alpine; dry, moderately moist, and&nbsp;
wet; and herblands, grasslands, shrublands, forests, and mixed&nbsp;
communities (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). These habitats support one of the&nbsp;
most unusual arthropod faunas in the world, with an estimated 10,000&nbsp;
native species (Howarth 1990). Unusual characters of Hawaii's native&nbsp;
arthropod fauna include the absence of social insects, such as ants and&nbsp;
termites, extremely small geographic ranges, novel ecological shifts&nbsp;
(unusual behavior and/or habitat), flightlessness, and loss of certain&nbsp;
antipredator behaviors (Howarth 1990; Simon et al. 1984; Zimmerman&nbsp;
1948, 1970).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackburn's sphinx moth (Manduca blackburni) is Hawaii's largest&nbsp;
native insect, with a wingspan of up to 12 cm (5 in). Like other sphinx&nbsp;
moths (family Sphingidae), it has long, narrow forewings and a thick,&nbsp;
spindle-shaped body tapered at both ends. It is grayish brown in color,&nbsp;
with black bands across the apical (top) margins of the hind wings and&nbsp;
five orange spots along each side of the abdomen. The larva is a&nbsp;
typical, large ``hornworm'' caterpillar, with a spinelike process on&nbsp;
the dorsal (upper) surface of the eighth abdominal segment.&nbsp;
Caterpillars occur in two color forms, a bright green or a grayish&nbsp;
phase. Both color forms have scattered white speckles throughout the&nbsp;
dorsum (back), with the lateral (side) margin of each segment bearing a&nbsp;
horizontal white stripe, and segments four to seven bearing diagonal&nbsp;
stripes on the lateral margins (Zimmerman 1958; Betsy Gagne, Hawaii&nbsp;
Department of Land and Natural Resources, pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackburn's sphinx moth is closely related to the tomato hornworm&nbsp;
(Manduca quinquemaculata) and has been confused with this species.&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth was described by Butler (1880) as Protoparce&nbsp;
blackburni, and named in honor of the Reverend Thomas Blackburn, who&nbsp;
collected the first specimens. It was believed to be the same as the&nbsp;
tomato hornworm (Sphinx celeus Hubner=Sphinx quinquemaculatus Hawthorn)&nbsp;
by Meyrick (1899), and then treated as a subspecies (Rothschild and&nbsp;
Jordan 1903, as cited by Riotte 1986) and placed in the genus&nbsp;
Phlegethontius (Zimmerman 1958). Riotte (1986) demonstrated that&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth is a distinct taxon in the genus Manduca,&nbsp;
native to the Hawaiian Islands, and reinstated it as a full species,&nbsp;
Manduca blackburni. D'Abrera (1986) tentatively considered Manduca&nbsp;
blackburni to be a synonym of Manduca quinquemaculata, but subsequent&nbsp;
authors (Howarth and Mull 1992; Nishida 1992) have disagreed with this&nbsp;
view, and the findings of Riotte (1986) are accepted here. Several&nbsp;
different common names have also been used for this species, including&nbsp;
the tomato hawk-moth (Swezey 1924b), the tobacco hornworm (Browne 1941;&nbsp;
van Dine 1905), the Hawaiian tobacco worm (Swezey 1931; Timberlake et&nbsp;
al. 1921), the Hawaiian tomato hornworm (Fullaway and Krauss 1945;&nbsp;
Zimmerman 1958), the Blackburn hawk moth (Hawaiian Entomological&nbsp;
Society (HES) 1990; Howarth and Mull 1992), and Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
(Service 1984). The name Blackburn's sphinx moth is used here.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hawaii, Blackburn's sphinx moth can be confused with the related&nbsp;
sweetpotato hornworm (Herse cingulata). In contrast to the sweetpotato&nbsp;
hornworm, adult Blackburn's sphinx moths can be distinguished by orange&nbsp;
rather than white dorsal abdominal spots, with black borders on both&nbsp;
the front and back margins of each segment, and a broader, marginal&nbsp;
black band on the hind wing. The larvae of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
differ from those of the tomato hornworm and tobacco hornworm by having&nbsp;
two dark longitudinal stripes on the head capsule, although this is not&nbsp;
always the case. While these stripes are usually apparent in the dark&nbsp;
phase, they are not always apparent in the green phase (Ellen&nbsp;
VanGelder, University of Hawaii, pers. comm. 1997). Adult Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth can be distinguished from the North American tomato&nbsp;
hornworm and tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexnotata) by the presence of&nbsp;
crescent-shaped white markings along the inner border of the black&nbsp;
bands on the forewing (B. Gagne, pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larvae of Blackburn's sphinx moth feed on plants in the nightshade&nbsp;
family (Solanaceae). The natural host plants are native shrubs in the&nbsp;
genus Solanum (popolo), and the native tree, Nothocestrum latifolium&nbsp;
(`aiea) (Riotte 1986), on which the larvae consume leaves, stems,&nbsp;
flowers, and buds (B. Gagne, pers. comm. 1994). However, many of the&nbsp;
host plants recorded for this species are not native to the Hawaiian&nbsp;
Islands, and include Nicotiana tabacum (commercial tobacco), Nicotiana&nbsp;
glauca (tree tobacco), Solanum melongena (eggplant), Lycopersicon&nbsp;
esculentum (tomato), and possibly Datura stramonium (Jimson weed)&nbsp;
(Riotte 1986). Development from egg to adult

[[Page 4772]]

can take as little as 56 days (Williams 1947), but pupae may remain in&nbsp;
a state of torpor (inactivity) in the soil up to a year (Williams 1931;&nbsp;
B. Gagne, pers. comm. 1994). Adult moths can be found throughout the&nbsp;
year (Riotte 1986).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, Blackburn's sphinx moth has been recorded from the&nbsp;
islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, and collected from&nbsp;
sea level to 760 meters (m) (2,500 feet (ft)) (Riotte 1986). Most&nbsp;
historical records were from coastal, lowland, and dryland forest&nbsp;
habitats in areas receiving less than 120 cm (50 in) annual rainfall.&nbsp;
It appears that this moth was historically most common on Maui (Riotte&nbsp;
1986).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few specimens of this species have been seen since 1940, and&nbsp;
after a concerted effort by staff at the B.P. Bishop Museum to relocate&nbsp;
this species in the late 1970's, it was considered to be extinct (Gagne&nbsp;
and Howarth 1985). In 1984, a single population was discovered on Maui&nbsp;
(first Maui site or population) (Riotte 1986). The population is&nbsp;
located on private and State lands, of which parts lie within a natural&nbsp;
area reserve, part is used by the Hawaii National Guard for military&nbsp;
training, and part is administered by the Department of Hawaiian&nbsp;
Homelands. Between 1986 and 1991, a total of 6 specimens were taken in&nbsp;
light traps 16 kilometers (km) (10 miles (mi)) from where the original&nbsp;
population was discovered in 1984. These findings may indicate the&nbsp;
presence of an additional population (Patrick Conant, Hawaii Department&nbsp;
of Agriculture, pers. comm. 1994), although adult moths are strong&nbsp;
fliers and these specimens could have originated at the known&nbsp;
population. Identification of two larvae and signs of two additional&nbsp;
larvae occurred in January 1997, although subsequent searches in&nbsp;
September 1996 (Conant and VanGelder 1997) did not reveal any signs of&nbsp;
eggs or larvae. Larvae are known to feed on `aiea and tree tobacco&nbsp;
(Frank Howarth, B.P. Bishop Museum, in litt. 1994), but the number of&nbsp;
larvae and adults produced each year is unknown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second Maui site or population is known from one adult and one&nbsp;
larvae observed in 1992 feeding on commercial tobacco in another&nbsp;
location on private land near sea level (Fern Duvall, Division of&nbsp;
Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW), pers. comm. 1998), and from three larvae&nbsp;
observed on tree tobacco on State land on Maui in January 1997, and&nbsp;
again from the same number of larvae observed in February 1998 (F.&nbsp;
Duvall, pers. comm. 1998). While researchers observed five to six eggs&nbsp;
on tree tobacco in 1997, they found no eggs and no adults at the same&nbsp;
site in 1998. There are no native host plants in this area (F. Duvall,&nbsp;
pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 1997, researchers discovered a population of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth on the State-owned island of Kahoolawe (Arthur&nbsp;
Medeiros, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)--Biological Resources Division&nbsp;
(BRD), in litt. 1998). This finding is the first record of the species&nbsp;
on this island, and thus represents an extension of the species known&nbsp;
range. Subsequent surveys (February and March 1998) indicate a&nbsp;
population exists on Kahoolawe, with egg and larval densities (114 eggs&nbsp;
and 93 larvae on 57 percent of tree tobacco plants searched) comparable&nbsp;
to those at the Maui site (A. Medeiros, in litt. 1998). In addition, a&nbsp;
fourth population of an unknown number of individuals was recently&nbsp;
discovered (April 1998) on State land on the island of Hawaii (A.&nbsp;
Medeiros, in litt. 1998), and a single, adult individual was observed&nbsp;
in April 1998 in a different location on the island of Hawaii (Steve L.&nbsp;
Montgomery, Hawaii Conservation Council, pers. comm. 1998). There are&nbsp;
no native Nothocestrum plants at this site, but both Nicotiana and&nbsp;
Solanum are present in the area (S.L. Montgomery, pers. comm. 1998). On&nbsp;
Kahoolawe, where the native host plant, `aiea, is not found, eggs and&nbsp;
larvae are known to occur on the non-native tree tobacco (A. Medeiros,&nbsp;
in litt. 1998). Eggs and larvae of the Hawaii population of Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth were found only on tree tobacco, although Nothocestrum&nbsp;
breviflorum (`aiea) is also present in the area (A. Medeiros, in litt.&nbsp;
1998).

Previous Federal Action

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An initial comprehensive Notice of Review for Invertebrate Animals&nbsp;
was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664). In&nbsp;
this notice we identified Blackburn's sphinx moth as a category 3A&nbsp;
taxon under the Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533 et seq.).&nbsp;
Category 3A taxa were those for which we had persuasive evidence of&nbsp;
extinction. We published an updated Notice of Review for animals on&nbsp;
January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554). Although Blackburn's sphinx moth had been&nbsp;
rediscovered by 1985, in the 1989 Notice of Review, this taxon was&nbsp;
again identified as category 3A. In the next Notice of Review on&nbsp;
November 15, 1994 (59 FR 58982), this species was reclassified as a&nbsp;
category 1 candidate for listing. Category 1 candidates were those taxa&nbsp;
for which we had on file sufficient information on biological&nbsp;
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals.&nbsp;
Beginning with our February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596), we&nbsp;
discontinued the designation of multiple categories of candidates, and&nbsp;
only those taxa meeting the definition of former category 1 candidates&nbsp;
are now considered candidates for listing purposes. In the February 28,&nbsp;
1996, Notice of Review, we identified Blackburn's sphinx moth as a&nbsp;
candidate species (61 FR 7596). A proposed rule to list Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth as endangered was published on April 2, 1997 (62 FR 15640).&nbsp;
In the September 19, 1997, Notice of Review (62 FR 49398), this species&nbsp;
was included as proposed for endangered status.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing of this final rule conforms with our Listing&nbsp;
Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999&nbsp;
(64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will&nbsp;
process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing&nbsp;
rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent&nbsp;
risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is&nbsp;
processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of&nbsp;
endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is&nbsp;
processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of&nbsp;
administrative petition findings (petitions <b>filed</b> under section 4 of&nbsp;
the Act) is the fourth priority. The processing of critical habitat&nbsp;
determinations (prudency and determinability decisions) and proposed or&nbsp;
final designations of critical habitat will no longer be subject to&nbsp;
prioritization under Listing Priority Guidance. Processing of this&nbsp;
final rule is a Priority 2 action. We have updated this rule to reflect&nbsp;
any changes in information concerning distribution, status, and threats&nbsp;
since the publication of the proposed rule.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the April 2, 1997, proposed rule and associated notifications,&nbsp;
we invited all interested parties to submit factual reports or&nbsp;
information that might contribute to the development of the final rule.&nbsp;
The public comment period ended June 2, 1997. Appropriate Federal and&nbsp;
State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and other&nbsp;
interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. We&nbsp;
published newspaper notices inviting public comment in the Maui News on&nbsp;
April 18, 1997, and in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Honolulu&nbsp;
Advertiser on April 21, 1997.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the public comment period, we received comments from five&nbsp;
parties. All parties supported the listing of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
as endangered.

[[Page 4773]]

None of the comments included additional information on the numbers of&nbsp;
individuals and populations of the moth species. One of the comments&nbsp;
suggested that listing will assist in the recovery of this species; one&nbsp;
comment indicated that listing may aid in promoting conservation&nbsp;
measures (e.g., fencing and weed control) that will assist the species;&nbsp;
and one comment indicated that cooperative efforts between a variety of&nbsp;
interested groups would be beneficial to the species. One commentor&nbsp;
noted that he has been working closely with several groups, including&nbsp;
us, to preserve the unique native habitat of dryland forest of Auwahi&nbsp;
and Kanaio. The Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife supported the&nbsp;
listing of Blackburn's sphinx moth and at the same time expressed&nbsp;
``reservations'' about future listings of Hawaiian insects and the&nbsp;
limited resources available for attainable recovery goals. One&nbsp;
commentor noted that the listing would have little or no impact on the&nbsp;
Hawaii Army National Guard's mission at Kanaio.

Peer Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with our policy published in the Federal Register on&nbsp;
July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), we also solicited the expert opinions of&nbsp;
three appropriate and independent specialists regarding pertinent&nbsp;
scientific or commercial data and assumptions relating to the taxonomy,&nbsp;
population models, and supportive biological and ecological information&nbsp;
for this species. We received no responses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the public comment period we received two letters from&nbsp;
Arthur C. Medeiros, USGS-BRD, that included information on the newly&nbsp;
discovered populations of Blackburn's sphinx moth. Steve L. Montgomery,&nbsp;
Hawaii Conservation Council, provided us information on a recent moth&nbsp;
sighting on the island of Hawaii, and Dr. Fern Duvall, DOFAW, provided&nbsp;
information on moth larvae and eggs observed in two additional areas of&nbsp;
Maui. We have included this information in this final rule.

Summary of Factors Affecting This Species

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and the regulations (50 CFR&nbsp;
part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act&nbsp;
set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A&nbsp;
species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due&nbsp;
to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These&nbsp;
factors and their application to Blackburn's sphinx moth (Manduca&nbsp;
blackburni) are as follows:

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment&nbsp;
of Its Habitat or Range

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Native vegetation on all of the main Hawaiian Islands has undergone&nbsp;
extreme alteration because of past and present land management&nbsp;
practices including ranching, agricultural development, and deliberate&nbsp;
introductions of alien animals and plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990;&nbsp;
Wagner et al. 1985). One of the primary threats facing Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth is destruction of its habitat by feral (returned to an&nbsp;
untamed state) animals. It is believed that the endemic plant,&nbsp;
Nothocestrum latifolium (`aiea), which is important for the survival of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth, is directly or indirectly affected by feral&nbsp;
animals. All four species of Nothocestrum, N. latifolium, N.&nbsp;
breviflorum, N. longifolium, and N. peltatum, occur in dry to mesic&nbsp;
(moderate moisture) forests, the habitat in which Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth was most frequently recorded. Two species, N. peltatum on Kauai&nbsp;
and N. breviflorum on Hawaii, are now federally endangered species (59&nbsp;
FR 3904, 59 FR 55770) due to severe degradation of dry forest habitats.&nbsp;
N. latifolium occurs on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and Maui. It is&nbsp;
not presently a protected species, but it is declining and uncommon on&nbsp;
all these islands (Hawaiian Heritage Program (HHP) 1993; Medeiros et&nbsp;
al. 1993). The stand of trees at the first Maui site of Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth may be the largest in the State (Medeiros et al. 1993) and&nbsp;
plays an important role in supporting a population of this moth species&nbsp;
(A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Nothocestrum latifolium presently occurs at moderate&nbsp;
densities at the first Maui site location of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
(HHP 1993), there is no seedling survival (Medeiros et al. 1993) and&nbsp;
the stand is in a degraded condition as a result of the presence of&nbsp;
feral goats (Capra hircus) (Medeiros et al. 1993; F. G. Howarth, pers.&nbsp;
comm. 1994; S.L. Montgomery, pers. comm. 1994). Goats were introduced&nbsp;
to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792 and are now abundant in dry forests on&nbsp;
Kauai, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, where they consume native vegetation,&nbsp;
trample roots and seedlings, accelerate erosion, and promote the&nbsp;
invasion of alien plants (Stone 1985; van Riper and van Riper 1982).&nbsp;
Bocconia frutescens (tree poppy) is one alien plant that is spreading&nbsp;
due to the activity of goats at the Maui Blackburn's sphinx moth site.&nbsp;
Tree poppy was first discovered in the Hawaiian Islands in 1920 and is&nbsp;
now naturalized in dry forests on Maui and mesic forests on Hawaii&nbsp;
(Medeiros et al. 1993; Symon 1990). On Maui, this fast-growing shrub is&nbsp;
a serious threat to the native host plant of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
primarily through displacement and shading of immature plants (Medeiros&nbsp;
et al. 1993; B. Gagne, pers. comm. 1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the endangered Nothocestrum breviflorum is reported in the&nbsp;
area of the Hawaii population of Blackburn's sphinx moth (Marie&nbsp;
Bruegmann, Service, pers. comm. 1998), there are no recorded&nbsp;
associations of either eggs, larvae, or adults with this species. These&nbsp;
trees are primarily threatened by habitat conversion associated with&nbsp;
development; competition from alien species such as Schinus&nbsp;
terebinthifolius (Christmas berry), Pennisetum setaceum (fountain&nbsp;
grass), Lantana camara (lantana), and Leucaena leucocephala (koa&nbsp;
haole); browsing by cattle; fire; and random environmental events; and&nbsp;
reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing&nbsp;
individuals (59 FR 10312).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Nothocestrum is not reported from Kahoolawe, there were&nbsp;
very few surveys of this island prior to the intense ranching&nbsp;
activities, that began in the middle of the last century, and the&nbsp;
subsequent use of the island as a weapons range for the past 50 years.&nbsp;
Prior to their removal, goats played a major role in the destruction of&nbsp;
vegetation on Kahoolawe (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). It is likely that the&nbsp;
reappearance of some vegetation as a result of the removal of the goats&nbsp;
and the cessation of military bombing activities, has allowed&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth to gain a foothold on the island. Although on&nbsp;
the island of Kahoolawe the vegetation on which Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
is currently dependent is alien and appears to adequately support&nbsp;
production and growth of the sphinx moth, it is believed that the&nbsp;
native host plant, `aiea, is important to the survival of this species&nbsp;
(A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). Restoration of the native forests on&nbsp;
Kahoolawe would benefit Blackburn's sphinx moth as well as other native&nbsp;
plants and invertebrates on the island.

B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or&nbsp;
Educational Purposes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare butterflies and moths are highly prized by collectors, and an&nbsp;
international trade exists for insect specimens for both live and&nbsp;
decorative markets, as well as the specialist trade that supplies&nbsp;
hobbyists, collectors, and

[[Page 4774]]

researchers (Morris et al. 1991; Williams 1996). The specialist trade&nbsp;
differs from both the live and decorative market in that it&nbsp;
concentrates on rare and threatened species (US Department of Justice&nbsp;
(USDJ) 1993). In general, the rarer the species, the more valuable it&nbsp;
is, and prices may exceed US $2,000 for rare specimens (Morris et al.&nbsp;
1991). For example, during a 4-year investigation, special agents of&nbsp;
the Service's Division of Law Enforcement executed warrants and seized&nbsp;
over 30,000 endangered and/or protected butterflies and beetles with a&nbsp;
wholesale commercial market value of about $90,000 in the United&nbsp;
States. The defendant, who was convicted, sold these rare butterflies&nbsp;
and beetles in malls and State fairs (USDJ 1995). In another case,&nbsp;
special agents found at least 13 species protected under the Act, and&nbsp;
another 130 species illegally taken from lands administered by the&nbsp;
Department of the Interior (USDJ 1995). The three men involved were&nbsp;
convicted of poaching and commercial trade of butterflies protected&nbsp;
under the Act (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1995; Williams 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sphinx moths, in general, are sought by collectors, and, as early&nbsp;
as the 1950's, there was a standing reward for specimens of another&nbsp;
rare Hawaiian sphinx moth (Tinostoma smargditis) (Zimmerman 1958).&nbsp;
Specimens of Blackburn's sphinx moth have already been secured and&nbsp;
traded by collectors and institutions (Dave Preston, B.P. Bishop&nbsp;
Museum, pers. comm. 1994). According to unconfirmed reports specimens&nbsp;
of Blackburn's sphinx moth from the Maui site are appearing in the&nbsp;
specialist trade (A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). Listing the species&nbsp;
as federally endangered will increase its attractiveness to collectors&nbsp;
(USDJ 1993). Unrestricted collecting and handling for scientific&nbsp;
purposes are known to impact populations of other species of rare&nbsp;
Lepidoptera (Murphy 1988), and are considered significant threats to&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth. Because of the high value accorded such&nbsp;
rarities, field collectors often take all individuals available (Morris&nbsp;
et al. 1991). Even limited collection from the small populations of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth can have deleterious effects on its&nbsp;
reproductive or genetic viability and lead to the eventual extinction&nbsp;
of this species.

C. Disease or Predation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The geographic isolation of the Hawaiian Islands restricted the&nbsp;
number of original successful colonizing arthropods and resulted in the&nbsp;
development of an unusual fauna. An unusually small number (15 percent)&nbsp;
of the known families of insects are represented by native Hawaiian&nbsp;
species (Howarth 1990). Some groups that often dominate continental&nbsp;
arthropod faunas, such as social Hymenoptera (group nesting ants, bees,&nbsp;
and wasps), are entirely absent from the native fauna. Commercial&nbsp;
shipping and air cargo to Hawaii have now resulted in the establishment&nbsp;
of over 2,500 species of alien arthropods (Howarth 1990; Howarth et al.&nbsp;
1994), with a continuing establishment rate of 10-20 new species per&nbsp;
year (Beardsley 1962, 1979). In addition to the accidental&nbsp;
establishment of alien species, private individuals and government&nbsp;
agencies began importing and releasing alien predators and parasites&nbsp;
for biological control of pests as early as 1865. These efforts&nbsp;
resulted in the introduction of 243 alien species between 1890 and&nbsp;
1985, in some cases with the specific intent of reducing populations of&nbsp;
native Hawaiian insects (Funasaki et al. 1988; Lai 1988). Alien&nbsp;
arthropods, whether purposefully or accidentally introduced, pose the&nbsp;
most serious threat to Hawaii's native insects, through direct&nbsp;
predation and parasitism, and competition for food or space (Howarth&nbsp;
and Medeiros 1989; Howarth and Ramsay 1991).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ants are not a natural component of Hawaii's arthropod fauna, and&nbsp;
native species evolved in the absence of predation pressure from ants.&nbsp;
Ants can be particularly destructive predators because of their high&nbsp;
densities, recruitment behavior, aggressiveness, and broad range of&nbsp;
diet (Reimer 1993). Because they are generalist feeders, ants may&nbsp;
affect prey populations independently of prey density, and may locate&nbsp;
and destroy isolated individuals and populations (Nafus 1993a). At&nbsp;
least 36 species of ants are known to be established in the Hawaiian&nbsp;
Islands, and 3 particularly aggressive species have severely affected&nbsp;
the native insect fauna (Zimmerman 1948). The island of Kahoolawe has&nbsp;
not been extensively surveyed at this time, but since ants have adult&nbsp;
winged reproductives, once established in Hawaii in general, they are&nbsp;
likely to colonize suitable habitats on all islands in time, and&nbsp;
several species are already known to occur on Kahoolawe. By the late&nbsp;
1870's, the big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) was present in&nbsp;
Hawaii, and its predation on native insects was noted by Perkins (1913)&nbsp;
who stated, ``It may be said that no native Hawaiian Coleoptera insect&nbsp;
can resist this predator, and it is practically useless to attempt to&nbsp;
collect where it is well established. Just on the limits of its range&nbsp;
one may occasionally meet with a few native beetles, e.g., species of&nbsp;
Plagithmysus, often with these ants attached to their legs and bodies,&nbsp;
but sooner or later they are quite exterminated from these&nbsp;
localities.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With few exceptions, in areas where the big-headed ant is present,&nbsp;
native insects, including most moths, are eliminated (Gagne; 1979;&nbsp;
Gillespie and Reimer 1993; Perkins 1913). The big-headed ant generally&nbsp;
does not occur at elevations higher than 600 m (2,000 ft), and is also&nbsp;
restricted by rainfall, rarely being found in particularly dry (less&nbsp;
than 35-50 cm (15-20 in) annually) or wet areas (more than 250 cm (100&nbsp;
in) annually) (Reimer et al. 1990). The big-headed ant is also known to&nbsp;
be a predator of eggs and caterpillars of native Lepidoptera, and can&nbsp;
completely exterminate populations (Illingworth 1915; Zimmerman 1958).&nbsp;
This ant occurs at the first Blackburn's sphinx moth Maui site and is a&nbsp;
direct threat to this population (Medeiros et al. 1993). Big-headed&nbsp;
ants also occur on Kahoolawe and Hawaii (A. Medeiros, pers. comm.&nbsp;
1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Argentine ant (Iridomyrmex humilis) was discovered on the&nbsp;
island of Oahu in 1940 (Zimmerman 1941) and is now established on all&nbsp;
the main islands. Unlike the big-headed ant, the Argentine ant is&nbsp;
primarily confined to elevations higher than 500 m (1,600 ft) in areas&nbsp;
of moderate rainfall (Reimer et al. 1990). This species can reduce&nbsp;
populations or even eliminate native arthropods at high elevations in&nbsp;
Haleakala National Park on Maui (Cole et al. 1992). On Maui, within 16&nbsp;
km (10 mi) of the Blackburn's sphinx moth population, Argentine ants&nbsp;
are significant predators on pest fruit flies (Wong et al. 1984).&nbsp;
Argentine ants have also been reported on the islands of Kahoolawe and&nbsp;
Hawaii (Adam Asquith, Service, and A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-legged ant (Anoplolepis longipes) appeared in Hawaii in&nbsp;
1952 and now occurs on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii (Reimer et al. 1990). It&nbsp;
inhabits elevations under 600 m (2,000 ft), in rocky areas with&nbsp;
moderate annual rainfall of less than 250 cm (100 in) (Reimer et al.&nbsp;
1990). Direct observations indicate that Hawaiian arthropods are&nbsp;
susceptible to predation by this species (Gillespie and Reimer 1993),&nbsp;
and Hardy (1979) documented the disappearance of most native insects&nbsp;
from Pua'alu'u in the Kipahulu District on Maui after the area was&nbsp;
invaded by the long-legged ant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least two species of fire ants, Solenopsis geminita and&nbsp;
Solenopsis papuana, are also important threats (Gillespie and Reimer&nbsp;
1993; Reagan 1986) and occur on all of the major islands (Reimer et al.&nbsp;
1990). Ants,

[[Page 4775]]

including the fire ant, S. geminita, are known to be the most important&nbsp;
and consistent mortality factor on eggs, and probably larvae, of the&nbsp;
butterfly Hypolimnas bolina in Guam, even where both predator and prey&nbsp;
are native (Nafus 1993a, 1993c). Solenopsis geminita occurs at the Maui&nbsp;
moth location (A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). Solenopsis geminita is&nbsp;
also known to be a significant predator on pest fruit flies in Hawaii&nbsp;
(Wong and Wong 1988). Solenopsis papuana is the only abundant,&nbsp;
aggressive ant that has invaded intact mesic forest above 600 m (2,000&nbsp;
ft) and is still expanding its range in Hawaii (Reimer 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ochetellus glaber (No Common Name (NCN)), a recently reported ant&nbsp;
introduction, occurs in the same habitat utilized on Kahoolawe by&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth (A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). Ochetellus&nbsp;
glaber was found in relatively high numbers foraging on shrubs of&nbsp;
Nicotiana where eggs and larvae of the sphinx moth occur. In one&nbsp;
instance, large numbers of Ochetellus glaber were observed emerging&nbsp;
from a dead moth larvae they had either predated or scavenged (A.&nbsp;
Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Kahoolawe, a large proportion of tagged Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
eggs disappeared without hatching, potentially indicating high egg&nbsp;
predation, likely by ants, but perhaps by birds, or dislodging by high&nbsp;
winds (A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawaii also has a limited fauna of native Hymenoptera wasp species,&nbsp;
with only two native species in the family Braconidae (Beardsley 1961),&nbsp;
neither of which attack Blackburn's sphinx moth. In contrast, species&nbsp;
of Braconidae are common predators (parasitoids) on the larvae of the&nbsp;
tobacco hornworm and the tomato hornworm in North America (Gilmore&nbsp;
1938). At least 74 alien species, in 41 genera, of braconid wasps are&nbsp;
now established in Hawaii, of which at least 35 species were&nbsp;
purposefully introduced as biological control agents (Nishida 1992).&nbsp;
Most species of alien Braconidae and Ichneumonidae wasps parasitic on&nbsp;
Lepidoptera are not host specific, but attack the caterpillars or pupae&nbsp;
of a variety of moths (Funasaki et al. 1988; Zimmerman 1948, 1978) and&nbsp;
have become the dominant larval parasitoids even in intact, high-
elevation, native forest areas of Hawaii (Howarth et al. 1994;&nbsp;
Zimmerman 1948). These wasps lay their eggs in the eggs or caterpillars&nbsp;
of Lepidoptera. Upon hatching, the wasp larvae consume internal&nbsp;
tissues, eventually destroying the host. At least one species&nbsp;
established in Hawaii, Hyposeter exiguae (NCN), is known to attack the&nbsp;
tobacco hornworm and the related tomato hornworm in North America&nbsp;
(Carlson 1979). This wasp is recorded from all of the main islands&nbsp;
except Lanai (Nishida 1992) and is a recorded parasitoid of the lawn&nbsp;
armyworm (Spodoptera maurita) on tree tobacco on Maui, an alternate&nbsp;
host of Blackburn's sphinx moth (Swezey 1927). No direct documentation&nbsp;
exists of alien braconid and ichneumonid wasps parasitizing Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth because of its rarity, but given the abundance and the&nbsp;
breadth of available hosts of these wasps, they are considered&nbsp;
significant threats to this species (Gagne and Howarth 1985; Howarth&nbsp;
1983; Howarth et al. 1994; F. G. Howarth, pers. comm. 1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small wasps in the family Trichogrammatidae parasitize insect eggs,&nbsp;
with numerous adults sometimes developing within a single host egg. The&nbsp;
taxonomy of this group is confusing, and it is unclear if Hawaii has&nbsp;
any native species (Nishida 1992, John Beardsley, University of Hawaii,&nbsp;
pers. comm. 1994). Several alien species are established in Hawaii&nbsp;
(Nishida 1992), including Trichogramma minutum (NCN), which is known to&nbsp;
attack the sweet potato hornworm in Hawaii (Fullaway and Krauss 1945).&nbsp;
In 1929, the wasp Trichogramma chilonis (NCN) was purposefully&nbsp;
introduced into Hawaii as a biological control agent for the Asiatic&nbsp;
rice borer (Chilo suppressalis) (Funasaki et al. 1988). This wasp&nbsp;
parasitizes the eggs of a variety of Lepidoptera in Hawaii, including&nbsp;
sphinx moths (Funasaki et al. 1988). Williams (1947) found 70 percent&nbsp;
of the eggs of Blackburn's sphinx moth to be parasitized by a&nbsp;
Trichogramma wasp that was probably this species. Over 80 percent of&nbsp;
the eggs of the alien grasswebworm (Herpetogramma licarsisalis) in&nbsp;
Hawaii are parasitized by these wasps (Davis 1969). In Guam,&nbsp;
Trichogramma chilonis effectively limits populations of the sweetpotato&nbsp;
hornworm (Nafus and Schreiner 1986), and the sweet potato hornworm is&nbsp;
considered under complete biological control by this wasp in Hawaii&nbsp;
(Lai 1988). While this wasp probably affects Blackburn's sphinx moth in&nbsp;
a density-dependent manner (Nafus 1993a), and theoretically is unlikely&nbsp;
to directly cause extinction of a population or the species, the&nbsp;
availability of more abundant, alternate hosts (any other lepidopteran&nbsp;
eggs) may allow for the extirpation of Blackburn's sphinx moth by this&nbsp;
or other egg parasites as part of a broader host base (Howarth 1991;&nbsp;
Nafus 1993b; Tothill et al. 1930).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawaii has no native parasitic flies in the family Tachinidae&nbsp;
(Nishida 1992). Two species of tachinid flies, Lespesia archippivora&nbsp;
(NCN) and Chaetogaedia monticola (NCN), were purposefully introduced to&nbsp;
Hawaii for control of army worms (Funasaki et al. 1988; Nishida 1992).&nbsp;
These flies lay their eggs externally on caterpillars, and upon&nbsp;
hatching, the larvae burrow into the host, attach to the inside surface&nbsp;
of the cuticle, and consume the soft tissues (Etchegaray and Nishida&nbsp;
1975b). In North America, Chaetogaedia monticola is known to attack at&nbsp;
least 36 species of Lepidoptera in 8 families, including sphinx moths;&nbsp;
Lespesia archippivora is known to attack over 60 species of Lepidoptera&nbsp;
in 13 families, including sphinx moths (Arnaud 1978). These species are&nbsp;
on record as parasites of a variety of Lepidoptera in Hawaii and are&nbsp;
believed to depress populations of at least two native species of moths&nbsp;
(Lai 1988). Over 40 percent of the caterpillars of the monarch&nbsp;
butterfly (Danaus plexippus) on Oahu are parasitized by Lespesia&nbsp;
archippivora (Etchegaray and Nishida 1975a), and the introduction of a&nbsp;
related species to Fiji resulted in the extinction of a native moth&nbsp;
there (Howarth 1991; Tothill et al. 1930). Both of these species occur&nbsp;
on Maui and are direct threats to Blackburn's sphinx moth.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackburn's sphinx moth occurs on State-owned and private lands.&nbsp;
This species currently receives no formal protection on any of these&nbsp;
lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal listing would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii&nbsp;
State law, which prohibits taking and encourages conservation by State&nbsp;
government agencies. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D-
4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant&nbsp;
that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the&nbsp;
(Federal) Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered&nbsp;
species under the provisions of this chapter and any indigenous species&nbsp;
of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be&nbsp;
a threatened species pursuant to the (Federal) Endangered Species Act&nbsp;
shall be deemed to be a threatened species under the provisions of this&nbsp;
chapter.'' Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal&nbsp;
agencies to administer and manage any area required for the&nbsp;
conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered&nbsp;
species (HRS, Sect. 195D-5(c)). Funds for these activities could be&nbsp;
made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative&nbsp;
Agreements).

[[Page 4776]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alien predatory and parasitic insects are an important reason for&nbsp;
the reduction in range and abundance of Blackburn's sphinx moth, and&nbsp;
may be the most serious present threat to its continued existence. Some&nbsp;
of these alien species were intentionally introduced by the State of&nbsp;
Hawaii's Department of Agriculture or other agricultural agencies&nbsp;
(Funasaki et al. 1988), and importations and augmentations of&nbsp;
lepidopteran parasitoids continue. Federal regulations for the&nbsp;
introductions of biocontrol agents have not adequately protected this&nbsp;
species (Lockwood 1993). Presently, there are no Federal statutes that&nbsp;
require biocontrol agents to be reviewed before they are introduced,&nbsp;
and the limited Federal review process requires consideration of&nbsp;
potential harm only to economically important species (Miller and Aplet&nbsp;
1993). Although the State of Hawaii requires that new introductions be&nbsp;
reviewed before release (HRS Chapt. 150A), postrelease biology and host&nbsp;
range cannot be predicted from laboratory studies (Gonzalez and&nbsp;
Gilstrap 1992; Roderick 1992), and the purposeful release or&nbsp;
augmentation of any lepidopteran predator or parasitoid is a potential&nbsp;
threat to Blackburn's sphinx moth (Gagne; and Howarth 1985; Simberloff&nbsp;

1992).

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small, restricted populations of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
increase the potential for extinction from random events. Sphinx moths&nbsp;
are typically strong fliers and likely existed as a series of&nbsp;
metapopulations on the various islands (Harrison et al. 1988).&nbsp;
Considerable intra-island movement between populations and continued&nbsp;
colonizations and extinctions in new localities probably occurred,&nbsp;
accounting for the historical records in tobacco crops and gardens&nbsp;
(Swezey 1924a, 1924b; Zimmerman 1958). The apparent extirpation of this&nbsp;
moth at most lower elevations and in more mesic areas is thought to&nbsp;
correlate with the presence of alien predators and parasitoids and the&nbsp;
loss of its preferred host plants. Thus, if any of the known&nbsp;
populations of the Blackburn's sphinx moth is severely reduced in size,&nbsp;
little potential exists for recolonization or ``rescue'' (Brown and&nbsp;
Kodric-Brown 1977) of the remaining population by immigrants (Arnold&nbsp;
1983). Research studies at the first Maui site suggest that during the&nbsp;
recent drought period, proportionally more eggs and larvae occurred on&nbsp;
`aiea than on tree tobacco, in a general reversal of the trend during&nbsp;
normal rainfall conditions (A. Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). Tree&nbsp;
tobacco is a quick-growing, pioneer shrub, while `aiea is a slow-
growing, drought-adapted, long-lived native tree that does well in&nbsp;
drought periods when tree tobacco is dying or losing its foliage (A.&nbsp;
Medeiros, pers. comm. 1998). This adaptation emphasizes the importance&nbsp;
of the native host plant to the survival of Blackburn's sphinx moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial&nbsp;
information available regarding the past, present, and future threats&nbsp;
faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. This&nbsp;
species is threatened by habitat degradation by introduced animals and&nbsp;
loss of its native host plant, overcollection, and predation by ants&nbsp;
and alien parasitoid wasps. The small number of populations of this&nbsp;
species also makes it susceptible to extinction from random events.&nbsp;
Because this species is in danger of extinction throughout all of its&nbsp;
range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.&nbsp;
Based on this evaluation, we find that the Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
should be listed as endangered. Although we have considered all&nbsp;
available alternatives to this action, such alternatives would not be&nbsp;
in accordance with the Act. Listing the species as a threatened species&nbsp;
would not accurately reflect the status of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
based on the information available.

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as the specific&nbsp;
areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at the time&nbsp;
it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those&nbsp;
physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species and that may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection; and specific areas outside the geographical area occupied&nbsp;
by a species at the time it is listed, upon a determination that such&nbsp;
areas are essential for the conservation of the species.&nbsp;
``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and procedures needed to&nbsp;
bring the species to the point at which listing under the Act is no&nbsp;
longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat designation directly affects only Federal agency&nbsp;
actions through consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act. Section&nbsp;
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they&nbsp;
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of a listed species or destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
its critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing&nbsp;
regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent&nbsp;
and determinable, we designate critical habitat at the time the species&nbsp;
is determined to be endangered or threatened. Our regulations (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(a)(1)) state that the designation of critical habitat is not&nbsp;
prudent when one or both of the following situations exist--(1) the&nbsp;
species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and&nbsp;
identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the&nbsp;
degree of threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat would not be beneficial to the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Listing Priority Guidance for FY 1999/2000 (64 FR 57114)&nbsp;
states that the processing of critical habitat determinations (prudency&nbsp;
and determinability decisions) and proposed or final designations will&nbsp;
no longer be subject to prioritization under the Listing Priority&nbsp;
Guidance. Critical habitat determinations, which were previously&nbsp;
included in final listing rules published in the Federal Register, may&nbsp;
now be processed separately, in which case stand-alone critical habitat&nbsp;
determinations will be published as notices in the Federal Register. We&nbsp;
will undertake critical habitat determinations and designations during&nbsp;
FY 2000 as allowed by our funding allocation for that year. As&nbsp;
explained in detail in the Listing Priority Guidance, our listing&nbsp;
budget is currently insufficient to allow us to immediately complete&nbsp;
all of the listing actions required by the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the proposed rule, we indicated that designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat was not prudent for Blackburn's sphinx moth because of a&nbsp;
concern that publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical&nbsp;
habitat in the Federal Register could lead to incidents of vandalism&nbsp;
and destruction of habitat, as well as take by insect collectors. We&nbsp;
also indicated that designation of critical habitat was not prudent&nbsp;
because we believed it would not provide any additional benefit beyond&nbsp;
that provided through listing as endangered. In the last few years, a&nbsp;
series of court decisions have overturned Service determinations&nbsp;
regarding a variety of species that designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.&nbsp;
Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th Cir. 1997); Conservation&nbsp;
Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d 1280 (D. Hawaii 1998)).&nbsp;
Based on the standards applied in those judicial opinions, we have re-
examined the question of

[[Page 4777]]

whether critical habitat for Blackburn's sphinx moth would be prudent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the small number of populations, Blackburn's sphinx moth is&nbsp;
vulnerable to unrestricted collection, vandalism, or other disturbance.&nbsp;
Rare butterflies and moths are highly prized by collectors and an&nbsp;
international, commercial trade exists for insect specimens which are&nbsp;
sought for both live and decorative markets, as well as the specialist&nbsp;
trade that supplies hobbyists, collectors, and researchers (Morris et&nbsp;
al. 1991) (see Factor B). We are concerned that these threats might be&nbsp;
exacerbated by the publication of critical habitat maps and further&nbsp;
dissemination of locational information. However, consistent with&nbsp;
recent case law, at this time, we believe there may be benefits of&nbsp;
critical habitat designation in some areas that may outweigh the risks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of this species, there may be some benefits to&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat. The primary regulatory effect of&nbsp;
critical habitat is the section 7 requirement that Federal agencies&nbsp;
refrain from taking any action that destroys or adversely modifies&nbsp;
critical habitat. While a critical habitat designation for habitat&nbsp;
currently occupied by this species would not be likely to change the&nbsp;
section 7 consultation outcome because an action that destroys or&nbsp;
adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be likely to result&nbsp;
in jeopardy to the species, there may be a few instances where section&nbsp;
7 consultation would be triggered only if critical habitat is&nbsp;
designated, such as occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in the&nbsp;
future. There may also be some educational or informational benefits to&nbsp;
designating critical habitat. Therefore, at least in areas where&nbsp;
opportunity for public access is limited, we find that critical habitat&nbsp;
is prudent for Blackburn's sphinx moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we cannot propose critical habitat designation for this&nbsp;
species at this time. The Service's Hawaiian field office, which would&nbsp;
have the lead for such a proposal, is in the process of complying with&nbsp;
the court order in Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, Civ. No.&nbsp;
97-00098 ACK (D. Haw. Mar. 9 and Aug. 10, 1998). In that case, the&nbsp;
United States District Court for the District of Hawaii remanded to the&nbsp;
Service its ``not prudent'' findings on critical habitat designation&nbsp;
for 245 species of Hawaiian plants. The court ordered the Service not&nbsp;
only to reconsider these findings, but also to designate critical&nbsp;
habitat for any species for which we determine on remand that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation is prudent. Proposed designations or non-
designations for 100 species are to be published by November 30, 2000.&nbsp;
Proposed designation or non-designations for the remaining 145 species&nbsp;
are to be published by April 30, 2002. Final designations or non-
designations are to be published within one year of each proposal.&nbsp;
Compliance with this court order is a huge undertaking involving&nbsp;
critical habitat determinations for over one-fifth of all species that&nbsp;
have ever been listed under the ESA, and over one-third of all listed&nbsp;
plant species. In addition, the Service has agreed to include in this&nbsp;
effort critical habitat designations for an additional 10 plants that&nbsp;
are subject of another lawsuit. See Conservation Council for Hawaii v.&nbsp;
Babbitt, Civ. No. 99-00283 HG. The Service cannot develop proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat designation for this species without significant&nbsp;
disruption of intensive efforts to comply with the Conservation Council&nbsp;
for Hawaii v. Babbitt remand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To attempt to do so could also affect the listing program Region-
wide. Administratively, the Service is divided into seven geographic&nbsp;
regions. This species is under the jurisdiction of Region 1, which&nbsp;
includes California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Hawaii and&nbsp;
other Pacific Islands. About one-half of all listed species occur in&nbsp;
Region 1. Region 1 receives, by far, the largest share of listing funds&nbsp;
of any Service region because it has the heaviest listing workload.&nbsp;
Region 1 must also expend its listing resources to comply with existing&nbsp;
court orders or settlement agreements. In fact, in the last fiscal&nbsp;
year, all of the Region's funding allocation for critical habitat&nbsp;
actions were extended to comply with court orders. If the Service were&nbsp;
to immediately prepare a proposed critical habitat designation for this&nbsp;
species, notwithstanding the court order pertaining to 245 Hawaiian&nbsp;
plant species, efforts to provide protection to many other species that&nbsp;
are not yet listed would be delayed. While we believe there may be some&nbsp;
benefits to designating critical habitat for this species, these&nbsp;
benefits are significantly fewer in comparison to the benefits of&nbsp;
listing a species under the ESA because, as discussed above, the&nbsp;
primary regulatory effect of critical habitat is limited to the section&nbsp;
7 requirement that Federal agencies refrain from taking any action that&nbsp;
destroys or adversely modifies critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, deferral of a proposal to designate critical&nbsp;
habitat will allow us to concentrate our limited resources on higher&nbsp;
priority critical habitat and other listing actions, while allowing us&nbsp;
to provide the basic protections under the ESA for this species. We&nbsp;
will develop a proposal to designate critical habitat for this species&nbsp;
as soon as feasible.

Available Conservation Measures

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or&nbsp;
threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,&nbsp;
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain&nbsp;
activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in&nbsp;
conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,&nbsp;
and individuals. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states that, ``Any&nbsp;
species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been&nbsp;
determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the (Federal)&nbsp;
Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species&nbsp;
under the provisions of this chapter.'' (Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS),&nbsp;
sect. 195D-4(a)). Therefore, Federal listing automatically invokes&nbsp;
listing under Hawaii State Law, which prohibits taking of listed&nbsp;
wildlife in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies&nbsp;
(HRS, sect. 195D-4 and 5). The Endangered Species Act provides for&nbsp;
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires&nbsp;
that recovery plans be developed for all listed species. The protection&nbsp;
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain&nbsp;
activities involving listed animals are discussed, in part, below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to&nbsp;
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or&nbsp;
listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this&nbsp;
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR&nbsp;
Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to&nbsp;
insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not&nbsp;
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to&nbsp;
destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action&nbsp;
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible&nbsp;
Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us. Federal&nbsp;
agency actions that may require conference and/or consultation include&nbsp;
military training of the Hawaii National Guard on State land near the&nbsp;
first Maui site, and unexploded ordnance cleanup that is funded by the&nbsp;
U.S. Navy near the Kahoolawe population on State land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federally supported activities that could affect Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth and its habitat in the future include, but are not limited to, the&nbsp;
following: release

[[Page 4778]]

or augmentation of biological control agents; road and firebreak&nbsp;
construction; troop movements; removal of unexploded ordnance; and fire&nbsp;
resulting from the use of live ammunition. Conservation of this moth is&nbsp;
consistent with most ongoing operations at the occupied sites; however,&nbsp;
listing of the species may entail consultation in regard to activities&nbsp;
taking place on military lands, or insect pest control operations in&nbsp;
Hawaii supported by Federal agencies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21,&nbsp;
17.22, and 17.23 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and&nbsp;
exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife. With respect to&nbsp;
animal species listed as endangered, all trade prohibitions of section&nbsp;
9(a)(1) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.21, apply. These&nbsp;
prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered&nbsp;
animal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&nbsp;
to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the&nbsp;
course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate&nbsp;
or foreign commerce; or take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt,&nbsp;
shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect--or attempt any of these). Certain&nbsp;
exceptions apply to our agents and State conservation agencies. The Act&nbsp;
and 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 also provide for the issuance of permits to&nbsp;
carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered animal&nbsp;
species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for&nbsp;
scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the&nbsp;
species, and for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful&nbsp;
activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our policy, published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994&nbsp;
(59 FR 34272), to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the&nbsp;
time a species is listed those activities that would or would not&nbsp;
constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this&nbsp;
policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of this listing on&nbsp;
proposed and ongoing activities within the species' range. We believe&nbsp;
that, based on the best available information, the following actions&nbsp;
will not result in a violation of section 9:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Possession, delivery, or movement, including interstate&nbsp;
transport and import into or export from the United States, involving&nbsp;
no commercial activity of dead specimens of this taxon that were&nbsp;
collected prior to the date of publication in the Federal Register of&nbsp;
this final rule;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal&nbsp;
agencies when such activity is conducted in accordance with any&nbsp;
reasonable and prudent measures given by the Service in a consultation&nbsp;
conducted under section 7 of the Act, and;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Activities on private lands that do not result in the take of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth, and do not require Federal authorization and/
or involve Federal funding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potential activities involving Blackburn's sphinx moth that we&nbsp;
believe will likely be considered a violation of section 9 include, but&nbsp;
are not limited to, the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Collection of specimens of this taxon for private possession,&nbsp;
or deposition in an institutional collection without a proper permit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Sale or purchase of specimens of this taxon, except for&nbsp;
properly documented antique specimens of this taxon at least 100 years&nbsp;
old, as defined by section 10(h)(1) of the Act;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Use of pesticides/herbicides in violation of label restrictions&nbsp;
resulting in take of Blackburn's sphinx moth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Unauthorized release of biological control agents that attack&nbsp;
any life stage of this taxon, and;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Removal or destruction of the native host plant, defined as any&nbsp;
species in the genus Nothocestrum, within areas occupied by this taxon&nbsp;
that results in harm to the Blackburn's sphinx moth. Regulations at 50&nbsp;
CFR 17.3 defines ``harm'' in the definition of take as an act that&nbsp;
actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant&nbsp;
habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures&nbsp;
wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,&nbsp;
including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities&nbsp;
involving endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances.&nbsp;
Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23.&nbsp;
Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the&nbsp;
propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in&nbsp;
connection with otherwise lawful activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a&nbsp;
violation of section 9 of the Act should be directed to the Pacific&nbsp;
Islands Manager (see ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of the&nbsp;
regulations concerning listed animals and inquiries regarding&nbsp;
prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife&nbsp;
Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th&nbsp;

National Environmental Policy Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental&nbsp;
Impact Statements, as defined under the authority of the National&nbsp;
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection&nbsp;
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered&nbsp;
Species Act of 1973, as amended. We published a notice outlining our&nbsp;
reasons for this determination in the Federal Register on October 25,&nbsp;
1983 (48 FR 49244).

Paperwork Reduction Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule does not contain any collection of information for which&nbsp;
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork&nbsp;
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. is required. An information&nbsp;
collection related to the rule pertaining to permits for endangered and&nbsp;
threatened species has OMB approval and is assigned clearance number&nbsp;
1018-0094. For additional information concerning permits and associated&nbsp;
requirements for endangered and threatened wildlife, see 50 CFR 17.22&nbsp;
and 17.23.
