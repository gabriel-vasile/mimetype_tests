Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat for Blackburn's Sphinx Moth

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
(Manduca blackburni), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973,&nbsp;
as amended (Act). A total of approximately 40,240 hectares (99,433&nbsp;
acres) on the Hawaiian Islands of Maui, Hawaii, Molokai, and Kahoolawe&nbsp;
are proposed for designation as critical habitat for Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat receives protection from destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification through required consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal&nbsp;
agency. Section 4 of the Act requires us to consider economic and other&nbsp;
relevant impacts when specifying any particular area as critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We solicit data and comments from the public on all aspects of this&nbsp;
proposal, including data on economic and other impacts of the&nbsp;
designation. We may revise or further refine critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries described in this proposal after taking into consideration&nbsp;
the comments or any new information received during the comment period,&nbsp;
and such information may lead to a final regulation that differs from&nbsp;
this proposal.

DATES: We will accept comments until the close of business on August&nbsp;
12, 2002. Requests for a public hearing must be received by July 29,&nbsp;
2002.

ADDRESSES: If you wish to comment, send your comments and other&nbsp;
materials on this proposed rule to Paul Henson, Field Supervisor,&nbsp;

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:&nbsp;&nbsp;

Species Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackburn's sphinx moth (moth) (Manduca blackburni) is one of&nbsp;
Hawaii's largest native insects, with a wingspan of up to 12&nbsp;
centimeters (cm) (5 inches (in)). Like other sphinx moths in the family&nbsp;
Sphingidae, it has long, narrow forewings, and a thick, spindle-shaped&nbsp;
body tapered at both ends. It is grayish brown in color, with black&nbsp;
bands across the apical (top) margins of the hind wings, and five&nbsp;
orange spots along each side of the abdomen. The larva is a typical,&nbsp;
large ``hornworm'' caterpillar, with a spine-like process on the dorsal&nbsp;
(upper) surface of the eighth abdominal segment. Caterpillars occur in&nbsp;
two color forms, a bright green or a grayish form. This variation in&nbsp;
color does not appear until the fifth instar (the fifth stage between&nbsp;
molts) (Van Gelder and Conant 1998). Both color forms have scattered&nbsp;
white speckles throughout the dorsum (back), with the lateral (side)&nbsp;
margin of each segment bearing a horizontal white stripe, and segments&nbsp;
four to seven bearing diagonal stripes on the lateral margins (Betsy&nbsp;
Gagne, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, pers. comm.&nbsp;
1998; Zimmerman 1958).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moth is closely related to the tomato hornworm (Manduca&nbsp;
quinquemaculata) and has been confused with this species. The moth was&nbsp;
described by Butler (1880) as Protoparce blackburni, and named in honor&nbsp;
of the Reverend Thomas Blackburn who collected the first specimens. It&nbsp;
was later believed to be the same species as the tomato hornworm&nbsp;
(Sphinx celeus Hubner = Sphinx quinquemaculatus Hawthorn) by Meyrick&nbsp;
(1899), and then treated as a subspecies (Rothschild and Jordan 1903,&nbsp;
as cited by Riotte 1986) and placed in the genus Phlegethontius&nbsp;
(Zimmerman 1958). Riotte (1986) demonstrated Blackburn's sphinx moth is&nbsp;
a distinct taxon in the genus Manduca, native to the Hawaiian Islands,&nbsp;
and reinstated it as a full species, Manduca blackburni.

Bio-Geographical Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hawaiian archipelago includes large volcanic islands as well as&nbsp;
the numerous shoals and atolls of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands.&nbsp;
The islands were formed sequentially by basaltic lava that emerged from&nbsp;
a hot spot in the earth's crust located near the current southeastern&nbsp;
coast of the island of Hawaii (Stearns 1985). It is widely accepted&nbsp;
that the native flora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands arrived by wind&nbsp;
and ocean currents, as passengers on or inside other organisms, or as&nbsp;
in the case of some fauna, on their own power, to evolve over the&nbsp;
course of millions of years into one of most highly speciated and&nbsp;
diverse natural environments found anywhere in the world (Wagner and&nbsp;
Funk 1995). Below, we provide brief geographical descriptions of the&nbsp;
Hawaiian Islands discussed in this proposed rule.

Hawaii

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The island of Hawaii is the largest, highest, and youngest of the&nbsp;
eight major islands, and it has an area of 10,458 square kilometers (km&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup>) (4,038 square miles (mi <sup>2</sup>)). It was formed by&nbsp;
five, interconnected shield volcanoes (Hualalai, Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa,&nbsp;
Kilauea, and Kohala Mountains). The Kohala Mountains, at the&nbsp;
northeastern portion of the island, are the oldest and reach an&nbsp;
elevation of about 1,344 m (4,408 ft) above sea level. Mauna Kea&nbsp;
volcano rises to 4,204 m (13,792 ft) (Department of Geography 1998) and&nbsp;
is inter-connected with Mauna Loa by an extensive saddle. Hualalai&nbsp;
volcano, located on the western side of the island, rises to an&nbsp;
elevation of 2,520 m (8,269 ft). The two active volcanoes on the&nbsp;
island, Mauna Loa and Kilauea, have elevations of 4,168 m (13,674 ft)&nbsp;
and 1,247 m (4,093 ft), respectively.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawaii lies within the trade wind belt (Mueller-Dombois et al.&nbsp;
1985), and moisture derived from the Pacific Ocean is carried to the&nbsp;
island by north-easterly trade winds. Heavy rains fall when moist air&nbsp;
is driven upward by windward mountain slopes (Wagner et al. 1999).&nbsp;
Considerable moisture reaches the lower leeward slopes of the saddle,&nbsp;
but these slopes dry out rapidly as elevation increases. Thus, the&nbsp;
leeward and saddle areas of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa tend to be dry.

Maui

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maui, the second largest island in Hawaii at 1,888 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
(729 mi<sup>2</sup>) area, was formed by the eruptions of two large&nbsp;
shield volcanoes, the older West Maui volcano on the west side, and the&nbsp;
larger, but much younger, Haleakala volcano to the east. Stream erosion&nbsp;
has cut deep valleys and ridges into the originally shield-shaped West&nbsp;
Maui volcano. The highest point on West Maui is Puu Kukui at 1,764 m&nbsp;
(5,788 ft) elevation, which has an average rainfall of 1,020 cm (400&nbsp;
in) per year, making it the second wettest spot in Hawaii (Department&nbsp;
of Geography 1998). East Maui's Haleakala Mountain, reaching 3,055 m&nbsp;
(10,023 ft) in elevation, has retained its classic shield shape with&nbsp;
the most recent eruptions occurring in the last 220 years on the&nbsp;
southeastern slopes. Rainfall on the slopes of Haleakala is extremely&nbsp;
variable, with its windward (northeastern) slope receiving the most&nbsp;
precipitation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geologically, Maui is part of the four-island complex comprising&nbsp;
Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe, known collectively as Maui Nui.&nbsp;
During the last Ice Age about 12,000 years ago when sea levels were&nbsp;
about 160 m (525 ft) below their present level, it is possible the four&nbsp;
islands were connected by a broad lowland plain (Department of&nbsp;
Geography 1998). This land bridge may have allowed the movement and&nbsp;
interaction of the islands' flora and fauna and contributed to the&nbsp;
close relationships of their biota of present (Hobdy 1993).

Kahoolawe

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The island of Kahoolawe comprises some 117 km<sup>2</sup> (45&nbsp;
mi<sup>2</sup>). Located in the lee of Haleakala, the island lies&nbsp;
approximately 11 kilometers (km) (6.7 miles (mi)) from East Maui. The&nbsp;
highest point is the rim of an extinct volcano at 450 m (1,477 ft)&nbsp;
above sea level (Department of Geography 1998). The estimated annual&nbsp;
precipitation is approximately 50 cm (20 in), with most of it falling&nbsp;
from November through March. In addition to the low precipitation,&nbsp;
Kahoolawe has the highest mean wind velocity of the Hawaiian Islands&nbsp;
(Department of Geography 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cattle from an early cattle industry and feral goats (Capra hircus)&nbsp;
largely denuded the island beginning in the 1800s. Kahoolawe was later&nbsp;
utilized as a military bombing target from 1941 through the 1980s.&nbsp;
Current restoration work and erosion control have been hampered by an&nbsp;
ongoing program to safely locate and dispose of unexploded ordnance on&nbsp;
the island.

Molokai

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The island of Molokai, the fifth largest in the Hawaiian Islands&nbsp;
chain, encompasses an area of about 689 km <sup>2</sup> (266 mi&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup>) (Department of Geography 1998). Three shield volcanoes&nbsp;
make up most of the land mass of Molokai: West Molokai Mountain, East&nbsp;
Molokai Mountain, and a volcano which formed Kalaupapa Peninsula&nbsp;
(Department of Geography 1998).

[[Page 40635]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The East Molokai Mountains rise 1,515 m (4,970 ft) above sea level&nbsp;
and comprises roughly 50 percent of the island's area (Department of&nbsp;
Geography 1998). Topographically, the windward side of East Molokai&nbsp;
differs from the leeward side. Precipitous cliffs line the northern&nbsp;
windward coast and deep inaccessible valleys dissect the coastal area.&nbsp;
The annual rainfall on the windward side ranges from 190 to 380 cm (75&nbsp;
to 150 in) or more, distributed throughout the year. The soils are&nbsp;
poorly drained and high in organic matter. Much of the native&nbsp;
vegetation on the northern part of East Molokai is intact because of&nbsp;
its relative inaccessibility to humans and nonnative animals, although&nbsp;
feral ungulates have begun to access some of these areas in recent&nbsp;
years (Department of Geography 1998).

Blackburn's Sphinx Moth Biology and Status

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few specimens of the moth have been seen since 1940, and after&nbsp;
a concerted effort by staff at the Bishop Museum to relocate this&nbsp;
species in the late 1970s, it was considered to be extinct (Gagne and&nbsp;
Howarth 1985). In 1984, a single population was rediscovered on Maui&nbsp;
(Riotte 1986), and subsequently, populations on two other islands were&nbsp;
rediscovered. Currently it is known only from populations on Maui,&nbsp;
Kahoolawe, and Hawaii. Moth population numbers are known to be small&nbsp;
based upon past sampling results, however, no reasonably accurate&nbsp;
estimate of population sizes have been determinable at this point due&nbsp;
to the adult moths' wide-ranging behavior and its overall rarity (A.&nbsp;
Medeiros, U.S. Geological Survey-Biological Resource Division, pers.&nbsp;
comm. 1998; Van Gelder and Conant 1998). Before humans arrived, dry and&nbsp;
mesic shrubland and forest covered about 823,283 hectares (2,034,369&nbsp;
acres) on all the main islands (Hawaii Natural Heritage Program (HHP)&nbsp;
2000), and it is likely the moth inhabited much of that area (Riotte&nbsp;
1986). Reports by early naturalists indicate the species was once&nbsp;
widespread and abundant, at least during European settlement on nearly&nbsp;
all the main Hawaiian islands (Riotte 1986).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moth has been recorded from the islands of Kauai, Kahoolawe,&nbsp;
Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, and has been observed from sea level&nbsp;
to 1,525 m (5,000 ft) elevation. Most historical records were from&nbsp;
coastal or lowland dry forest habitats in areas receiving less than 127&nbsp;
cm (50 in) annual rainfall. On the island of Kauai, the moth was&nbsp;
recorded only from the coastal area of Nawiliwili. Populations were&nbsp;
known from Honolulu, Honouliuli, and Makua on leeward Oahu, and Kamalo,&nbsp;
Mapulehu, and Keopu on Molokai. On Hawaii, it was known from Hilo,&nbsp;
Pahala, Kalaoa, Kona, and Hamakua. It appears this moth was&nbsp;
historically most common on Maui, where it was recorded from Kahului,&nbsp;
Spreckelsville, Makena, Wailuku, Kula, Lahaina, and West Maui.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larvae of the moth feed on plants in the nightshade family&nbsp;
(Solanaceae). The natural host plants are native trees within the genus&nbsp;
Nothocestrum (aiea) (Riotte 1986), on which the larvae consume leaves,&nbsp;
stems, flowers, and buds (B. Gagne, pers. comm. 1994). However, many of&nbsp;
the host plants recorded for this species are not native to the&nbsp;
Hawaiian Islands, and include Nicotiana tabacum (commercial tobacco),&nbsp;
Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco), Solanum melongena (eggplant),&nbsp;
Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), and possibly Datura stramonium&nbsp;
(Jimson weed) (Riotte 1986). Sphingid moths are known to exploit&nbsp;
nutritious but low-density, low-apparency host plants such as vines and&nbsp;
sapling trees (Kitching and Cadiou 2000). Development from egg to adult&nbsp;
can take as little as 56 days (Williams 1947), but pupae may remain in&nbsp;
a state of torpor (inactivity) in the soil for up to a year (B. Gagne,&nbsp;
pers. comm., 1994; Williams 1931). Adult moths have been found&nbsp;
throughout the year (Riotte 1986). Adult moths feed on nectar,&nbsp;
including that from Ipomoea indica (D. Hopper, in litt., 2000, 2002).&nbsp;
During Van Gelder and Conant's captive-rearing study (1998), adult moth&nbsp;
feeding was not observed and captive-reared adult moths lived no longer&nbsp;
than 12 days. In general, sphingids are known to live longer than most&nbsp;
moths because of their ability to feed and take in water from a variety&nbsp;
of sources, rather than relying only upon stored fat reserves. Because&nbsp;
they live longer than most moths, female sphingid moths have less time&nbsp;
pressure to mate and lay eggs, and often will take more time in&nbsp;
locating the best host plants for egg laying (Kitching and Cadiou&nbsp;
2000).

Blackburn's Sphinx Moth Habitat and Range

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant species composition in the moth's habitat varies considerably&nbsp;
depending on location and elevation, but some of the most common native&nbsp;
plants in areas where the moth occur are Diospyros sandwicensis trees,&nbsp;
Rauvolfia sandwicensis trees, Reynoldsia sandwicensis trees, Pouteria&nbsp;
sandwicensis trees, Dodonaea viscosa shrubs, Erythrina sandwicensis,&nbsp;
and Myoporum sandwicense shrubs (Cabin et al. 2000; Roderick and&nbsp;
Gillespie 1997; Van Gelder and Conant 1998; Wagner et al. 1999; Wood&nbsp;
2001a, b).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest populations of Blackburn's sphinx moths, on Maui and&nbsp;
Hawaii, are associated with trees in the genus Nothocestrum (Van Gelder&nbsp;
and Conant 1998). For example, the large stand of Nothocestrum trees&nbsp;
within the Kanaio Natural Area Reserve (NAR), Maui, is likely the&nbsp;
largest in the State (Medeiros et al. 1993), and may explain why the&nbsp;
moth occurs with such regularity in the Kanaio area (A. Medeiros, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 1994). Nothocestrum is a genus of four species endemic to the&nbsp;
Hawaiian Islands (Symon 1999). Nothocestrum species currently occur on&nbsp;
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Hawaii, and Maui. One species, N.&nbsp;
longifolium primarily occurs in wet forests, but can occur in mesic&nbsp;
forests as well. Three species, N. latifolium, N. breviflorum, and N.&nbsp;
peltatum, occur in dry to mesic forests, the habitat in which the moth&nbsp;
has been most frequently recorded. Moth larvae have been documented&nbsp;
feeding on two Nothocestrum species, N. latifolium and N. breviflorum;&nbsp;
it is likely that N. peltatum and N. longifolium are suitable host&nbsp;
plants for larval moths as well. This is supported not only by the fact&nbsp;
that they are closely related to known larval hosts, but also because&nbsp;
there are past historical records of the moth occurring on the islands&nbsp;
of Kauai and Oahu, where N. latifolium is not abundant and N.&nbsp;
breviflorum does not occur. Furthermore, the species is known to feed&nbsp;
on a variety of native and non-native Solanaceae.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Molokai, moth habitat includes vegetation consisting primarily&nbsp;
of mixed-species, mesic and dry forest communities composed of native&nbsp;
and introduced plants (HHP 2000). Although Molokai is not known to&nbsp;
currently contain a moth population, past moth sightings on Molokai&nbsp;
have been reported and the island does contain native Nothocestrum&nbsp;
larval host plants, including N. longifolium and N. latifolium, as well&nbsp;
as adult host plants and restorable, manageable areas associated with&nbsp;
these existing host plants (Wood 2001a). Because of its proximity to&nbsp;
Maui (historically, home to the most persistent and largest population)&nbsp;
and the fact that Molokai has in the past and presently supports large&nbsp;
stands of N. latifolium, many researchers believe the moth could re-
establish itself on the island and become a viable population(s) in the&nbsp;
future (F. Howarth, Bishop Museum, pers. comm. 2001).

[[Page 40636]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The endangered larval host plant, Nothocestrum breviflorum, as well&nbsp;
as adult host plants occur in the areas on Hawaii Island supporting&nbsp;
populations of the moth (M. Bruegmann, Service, pers. comm., 1998) and&nbsp;
there are many recorded associations of eggs, larvae, and adult moths&nbsp;
with this plant species. This tree species is primarily threatened by&nbsp;
habitat conversion associated with development; competition from&nbsp;
nonnative species such as Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry),&nbsp;
Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass), Lantana camara (lantana), and&nbsp;
Leucaena leucocephala (koa haole); browsing by cattle; fire; random&nbsp;
environmental events such as prolonged drought; and reduced&nbsp;
reproductive potential due to the small number of existing individuals&nbsp;
(59 FR 10325).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Nothocestrum species are not currently reported from&nbsp;
Kahoolawe, there were very few surveys of this island prior to the&nbsp;
intense ranching activities, which began in the middle of the last&nbsp;
century, and the subsequent use of the island as a weapons range for 50&nbsp;
years. Prior to their removal, goats also played a major role in the&nbsp;
destruction of vegetation on Kahoolawe (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). It is&nbsp;
likely the reappearance of some vegetation as a result of the removal&nbsp;
of the goats and the cessation of military bombing activities has&nbsp;
allowed the moth to inhabit the island. On Kahoolawe, moth larvae feed&nbsp;
on the nonnative Nicotiana glauca, which appears to adequately support&nbsp;
production and growth of the larval stage during non-drought years.&nbsp;
However, the native Nothocestrum are more stable and drought-resistant&nbsp;
than the Nicotiana glauca, which dies back significantly during&nbsp;
especially dry years (A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 2001). Therefore, it&nbsp;
appears likely that long-term survival of the moth on Kahoolawe will&nbsp;
require the planting of Nothocestrum latifolium (A. Medeiros, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 1998).

Threats to the Conservation of Blackburn's Sphinx Moth

Habitat Loss and Degradation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dry to mesic forest habitats in Hawaii have been severely degraded&nbsp;
due to past and present land management practices including ranching,&nbsp;
the impacts of introduced plants and animals, wildfire, and&nbsp;
agricultural development (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Due to these&nbsp;
factors, Nothocestrum peltatum on Kauai and N. breviflorum on Hawaii&nbsp;
are now federally listed as endangered species (59 FR 9327; 59 FR&nbsp;
10325). Although all Nothocestrum species are not presently listed as&nbsp;
endangered or threatened, the entire genus is declining and considered&nbsp;
uncommon (HHP 2000; Medeiros et al. 1993). For example, while N.&nbsp;
latifolium presently occurs at moderate densities at Kanaio NAR (HHP&nbsp;
1993), there has been a complete lack of seedling survival (Medeiros et&nbsp;
al. 1993) and the stand is being degraded by goats (Medeiros et al.&nbsp;
1993; F.G. Howarth, Bishop Museum, pers. comm., 1994; S. Montgomery,&nbsp;
Bishop Museum, pers. comm., 1994). Goats have played a major role in&nbsp;
the destruction of dryland and mesic forests throughout the Hawaiian&nbsp;
Islands (Stone 1985; van Riper and van Riper 1982).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before humans arrived, dry to mesic shrub land and forest covered&nbsp;
about 823,283 ha (2,034,369 ac) on all the main islands (HHP 2000), and&nbsp;
it is likely Blackburn's sphinx moth inhabited much of that area&nbsp;
(Riotte 1986). Reports by early naturalists indicate the species was&nbsp;
once widespread and abundant on nearly all the main Hawaiian Islands&nbsp;
during European settlement (Riotte 1986). Because the moth was once so&nbsp;
widespread and sphinx moths are known to be strong fliers, we believe&nbsp;
it is likely inter-island dispersal of the species occurred to some&nbsp;
degree prior to the loss of much of its historical habitat. Currently,&nbsp;
the areas of dry to mesic shrub and forest habitats below 1,525 m&nbsp;
(5,000 ft) that are or could potentially be suitable for the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth are approximately 148,588 ha (367,161 ac). Thus&nbsp;
it appears the moth's range has declined on the order of 82 percent&nbsp;
since humans arrived in Hawaii 1,600 years ago (HHP 2000; Kirch 1982).

Localized Extirpation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to, or perhaps because of, habitat loss and&nbsp;
fragmentation, Blackburn's sphinx moths are also susceptible to&nbsp;
seasonal variations and weather fluctuations affecting their quality&nbsp;
and quantity of available habitat and food. For example, during times&nbsp;
of drought, it is expected nectar availability for adult moths will&nbsp;
decrease. During times of decreased nectar availability, life spans of&nbsp;
individuals may not be affected, but studies with butterflies have&nbsp;
shown marked decreases in reproductive capacity for many species&nbsp;
(Center for Conservation Biology Update 1994). In another study, Janzen&nbsp;
(1984) reported that host plant availability directly affected sphingid&nbsp;
reproductive activity. In fact, for some lepidopteran (butterflies and&nbsp;
moths) species, if nectar intake is cut in half, reproduction is also&nbsp;
cut approximately in half. Such resource stress may occur on any time&nbsp;
scale, ranging from a few days to an entire season, and a pattern of&nbsp;
continuous long-term adult feeding stress could affect the future&nbsp;
viability of a population (Center for Conservation Biology Update&nbsp;
1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, habitat suitability for herbivorous insects is determined by&nbsp;
factors other than host plant occurrence or density. Microclimatic&nbsp;
conditions (Thomas 1991; Solbreck 1995) and predator pressure (Roland&nbsp;
1993; Roland and Taylor 1995; Walde 1995) are two such widely reported&nbsp;
factors. In a study of moth population structure, habitat patch size&nbsp;
and the level of sun exposure were shown to affect species occupancy,&nbsp;
while patch size and the distance from the ocean coast were reported to&nbsp;
affect moth density (Forare and Solbreck 1997). Moth populations in&nbsp;
small habitat patches were more likely to become extinct (Forare and&nbsp;
Solbreck 1997).

Nonnative Arthropods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The geographic isolation of the Hawaiian Islands restricted the&nbsp;
number of original successful colonizing arthropods and resulted in the&nbsp;
development of an unusual fauna. Only 15 percent of the known insect&nbsp;
families are represented by the native insects of Hawaii (Howarth&nbsp;
1990). Some groups that often dominate continental arthropod faunas,&nbsp;
such as social Hymenoptera (group-nesting ants, bees, and wasps), are&nbsp;
entirely absent from the native Hawaiian fauna. Accidental&nbsp;
introductions from commercial shipping and air cargo to Hawaii has now&nbsp;
resulted in the establishment of over 2,500 species of alien arthropods&nbsp;
(Howarth 1990; Howarth et al. 1994), with a continuing establishment&nbsp;
rate of 10 to 20 new species per year (Nishida 1997). In addition to&nbsp;
the accidental establishment of nonnative species, private individuals&nbsp;
and government agencies began importing and releasing nonnative&nbsp;
predators and parasites for biological control of pests as early as&nbsp;
1865. This resulted in the introduction of 243 nonnative species&nbsp;
between 1890 and 1985, in some cases with the specific intent of&nbsp;
reducing populations of native Hawaiian insects (Funasaki et al. 1988,&nbsp;
Lai 1988). Alien arthropods, whether purposefully introduced or&nbsp;
accidental, pose a serious threat to Hawaii's native insects, through&nbsp;
direct predation, parasitism, and competition for food or space&nbsp;
(Howarth and Medeiros 1989; Howarth and Ramsay 1991).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ants are not a natural component of Hawaii's arthropod fauna, and&nbsp;
native species evolved in the absence of predation pressure from ants.&nbsp;
Ants can

[[Page 40637]]

be particularly destructive predators because of their high densities,&nbsp;
recruitment behavior, aggressiveness, and broad range of diet (Reimer&nbsp;
1993). Because they are often generalist feeders, ants may affect prey&nbsp;
populations independent of prey density, and may locate and destroy&nbsp;
isolated individuals and populations (Nafus 1993a). At least 36 species&nbsp;
of ants have become established in the Hawaiian Islands, and three&nbsp;
particularly aggressive species have severely affected the native&nbsp;
insect fauna (Zimmerman 1948).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in areas where the big-headed ant (Pheidole&nbsp;
megacephala) is present, native insects, including most moths, have&nbsp;
been eliminated (Gagne 1979; Gillespie and Reimer 1993; Perkins 1913).&nbsp;
The big-headed ant generally does not occur at elevations higher than&nbsp;
600 m (2,000 ft), and is also restricted by rainfall, rarely being&nbsp;
found in particularly dry (less than 35 to 50 cm (15 to 20 in)&nbsp;
annually) or wet (more than 250 cm (100 in) annually) areas (Reimer et&nbsp;
al. 1990). The big-headed ant is also known to be a predator of eggs&nbsp;
and caterpillars of native Lepidoptera, and can completely exterminate&nbsp;
populations (Zimmerman 1958). This ant occurs on all the major Hawaiian&nbsp;
Islands, including those currently inhabited by Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
and is a direct threat to these populations (Medeiros et al. 1993;&nbsp;
Nishida 1997; N. Reimer, pers. comm., 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several additional ant species threaten the conservation of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth. The Argentine ant (Linepithema humilis) has&nbsp;
been reported from several islands including Maui, Kahoolawe, and&nbsp;
Hawaii (A. Asquith, Service, pers. comm., 1998; A. Medeiros, pers.&nbsp;
comm. 1998; Nishida 1997). The long-legged ant (Anoplolepis longipes)&nbsp;
is reported from several islands including Hawaii and Maui (Hardy&nbsp;
1979). At least two species of fire ants, Solenopsis geminata and&nbsp;
Solenopsis papuana, are also important threats (Gillespie and Reimer&nbsp;
1993; Reagan 1986) and occur on many of the major islands (Nishida&nbsp;
1997; Reimer et al. 1990). Ochetellus glaber, a recently reported ant&nbsp;
introduction, occurs on Maui, Hawaii, and Kahoolawe (A. Medeiros, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 1998; Nishida 1997; N. Reimer, pers. comm., 2001).

Parasitic Wasps

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawaii also has a limited fauna of native Hymenoptera wasp species,&nbsp;
with only two native species in the family Braconidae (Beardsley 1961),&nbsp;
neither of which are known to parasitize Blackburn's sphinx moth. In&nbsp;
contrast, other species of Braconidae are common predators&nbsp;
(parasitoids) on the larvae of the tobacco hornworm and the tomato&nbsp;
hornworm in North America (Gilmore 1938). There are now at least 74&nbsp;
nonnative species, in 41 genera, of braconid wasps established in&nbsp;
Hawaii, of which at least 35 species were purposefully introduced as&nbsp;
biological control agents (Nishida 1997). Most species of alien&nbsp;
braconid and ichneumonid wasps that parasitize moths are not host-
specific, but attack the caterpillars or pupae of a variety of moths&nbsp;
(Funasaki et al. 1988; Zimmerman 1948, 1978) and have become the&nbsp;
dominant larval parasitoids even in intact, high-elevation, native&nbsp;
forest areas of the Hawaiian Islands (Howarth et al. 1994; Zimmerman&nbsp;
1948). These wasps lay their eggs within the eggs or caterpillars of&nbsp;
Lepidoptera. Upon hatching, the wasp larvae consume internal tissues,&nbsp;
eventually killing the host. At least one species established in&nbsp;
Hawaii, Hyposeter exiguae, is known to attack the tobacco hornworm and&nbsp;
the related tomato hornworm in North America (Carlson 1979). This wasp&nbsp;
is recorded from all of the main islands except Kahoolawe and Lanai&nbsp;
(Nishida 1997) and is a recorded parasitoid of the lawn armyworm&nbsp;
(Spodoptera maurita) on tree tobacco on Maui (Swezey 1927). Because of&nbsp;
the rarity of Blackburn's sphinx moths, no documentation exists of&nbsp;
alien braconid and ichneumonid wasps parasitizing the species. However,&nbsp;
given the abundance and the breadth of available hosts of these wasps,&nbsp;
they are considered significant threats to the moth (Gagne and Howarth&nbsp;
1985; Howarth 1983; Howarth et al. 1994; F. Howarth, pers. comm.,&nbsp;
1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small wasps in the family Trichogrammatidae parasitize insect eggs,&nbsp;
with numerous adults sometimes developing within a single host egg. The&nbsp;
taxonomy of this group is confusing, and it is unclear if Hawaii has&nbsp;
any native species (Nishida 1997, J. Beardsley, University of Hawaii,&nbsp;
pers. comm., 1994). Several alien species are established in Hawaii&nbsp;
(Nishida 1997), including Trichogramma minutum, which is known to&nbsp;
attack the sweet potato hornworm in Hawaii (Fullaway and Krauss 1945).&nbsp;
In 1929, the wasp Trichogramma chilonis was purposefully introduced&nbsp;
into Hawaii as a biological control agent for the Asiatic rice borer&nbsp;
(Chilo suppressalis) (Funasaki et al. 1988). This wasp parasitizes the&nbsp;
eggs of a variety of Lepidoptera in Hawaii, including sphinx moths&nbsp;
(Funasaki et al. 1988). Williams (1947) found 70 percent of the eggs of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth to be parasitized by a Trichogramma wasp that&nbsp;
was probably T. chilonis. Over 80 percent of the eggs of the alien&nbsp;
grasswebworm (Herpetogramma licarsisalis) in Hawaii are parasitized by&nbsp;
these wasps (Davis 1969). In Guam, Trichogramma chilonis effectively&nbsp;
limits populations of the sweet potato hornworm (Nafus and Schreiner&nbsp;
1986), and the sweet potato hornworm is considered under complete&nbsp;
biological control by this wasp in Hawaii (Lai 1988). While this wasp&nbsp;
probably affects Blackburn's sphinx moth in a density-dependent manner&nbsp;
(Nafus 1993a), and theoretically is unlikely to directly cause&nbsp;
extinction of a population or the species, the availability of more&nbsp;
abundant, alternate hosts (any other lepidopteran eggs) may allow for&nbsp;
the extirpation of Blackburn's sphinx moth by this or other egg&nbsp;
parasites as part of a broader host base (Howarth 1991; Nafus 1993b;&nbsp;
Tothill et al. 1930).

Parasitic Flies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawaii has no native parasitic flies in the family Tachinidae&nbsp;
(Nishida 1997). Two species of tachinid flies, Lespesia archippivora&nbsp;
and Chaetogaedia monticola, were purposefully introduced to Hawaii for&nbsp;
control of army worms (Funasaki et al. 1988; Nishida 1997). These flies&nbsp;
lay their eggs externally on caterpillars, and upon hatching, the&nbsp;
larvae burrow into the host, attach to the inside surface of the&nbsp;
cuticle, and consume the soft tissues (Etchegaray and Nishida 1975b).&nbsp;
In North America, C. monticola is known to attack at least 36 species&nbsp;
of Lepidoptera in eight families, including sphinx moths; L.&nbsp;
archippivora is known to attack over 60 species of Lepidoptera in 13&nbsp;
families, including sphinx moths (Arnaud 1978). These species are on&nbsp;
record as parasites of a variety of Lepidoptera in Hawaii and are&nbsp;
believed to depress populations of at least two native species of moths&nbsp;
(Lai 1988). Over 40 percent of the caterpillars of the monarch&nbsp;
butterfly (Danaus plexippus) on Oahu are parasitized by Lespesia&nbsp;
archippivora (Etchegaray and Nishida 1975a) and the introduction of a&nbsp;
related species to Fiji resulted in the extinction of a native moth&nbsp;
there (Howarth 1991; Tothill et al. 1930). Both of these species occur&nbsp;
on Maui and Hawaii (Nishida 1997) and are direct threats to the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the findings discussed above, nonnative predatory and&nbsp;
parasitic insects are considered important factors contributing to the&nbsp;
reduction in range and abundance of the Blackburn's sphinx moth, and in&nbsp;
combination with habitat loss and

[[Page 40638]]

fragmentation, are a serious threat to its continued existence. Some of&nbsp;
these nonnative species were intentionally introduced by the State of&nbsp;
Hawaii's Department of Agriculture or other agricultural agencies&nbsp;
(Funasaki et al. 1988) and importations and augmentations of&nbsp;
lepidopteran parasitoids continues. Although the State of Hawaii&nbsp;
requires new introductions be reviewed before release (Hawaii State&nbsp;
Department of Agriculture (HDOA) 1994), post-release biology and host&nbsp;
range cannot be predicted from laboratory studies (Gonzalez and&nbsp;
Gilstrap 1992; Roderick 1992) and the purposeful release or&nbsp;
augmentation of any lepidopteran predator or parasitoid is a potential&nbsp;
threat to the conservation of the Blackburn's sphinx moth (Gagne and&nbsp;
Howarth 1985; Simberloff 1992).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Table 1 above indicates, the assemblage of potential alien&nbsp;
predators and parasites on each island may differ. Furthermore, the&nbsp;
arthropod community may differ from area to area even on the same&nbsp;
island based upon elevation, temperature, prevailing wind pattern,&nbsp;
precipitation, or other factors (Nishida 1997). Conserving and or&nbsp;
restoring moth populations in multiple locations should decrease the&nbsp;
likelihood that the effect of any single alien parasite or predator or&nbsp;
combined pressure of such species could result in the diminished vigor&nbsp;
or extinction of the moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the threats discussed above, we do not believe the existing&nbsp;
habitats containing Blackburn's sphinx moth populations are sufficient&nbsp;
to ensure the long-term survival of the species. A diverse set of&nbsp;
habitats and climates within its former range is necessary to remove&nbsp;
the long-term risk of range-wide extinction of the species. Threats to&nbsp;
the moth identified in the final listing rule (65 FR 4770) include:&nbsp;
vandalism and collection, predation/parasitism by alien arthropods, and&nbsp;
habitat alteration and loss from nonnative plant and ungulate invasion.&nbsp;
Considering the rarity of the moth, small population size is also&nbsp;
believed to be a factor that threatens the long-term survival of the&nbsp;
species since random population fluctuations and catastrophic events&nbsp;
are more likely to result in the extirpation of local populations.&nbsp;
Wildfire and feral ungulate pressure on the moth's habitat and the&nbsp;
direct pressure of alien predators and parasites are important factors&nbsp;
currently reducing the moth's range and abundance and threatening the&nbsp;
species' continued existence (Funasaki et al. 1988).

Previous Federal Action

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An initial comprehensive Notice of Review for Invertebrate Animals&nbsp;
was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664). In&nbsp;
this notice, we identified Blackburn's sphinx moth as a category 3A&nbsp;
taxon. Category 3A taxa were those for which we had persuasive evidence&nbsp;
of extinction. We published an updated Notice of Review for animals on&nbsp;
January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554). Although Blackburn's sphinx moth had been&nbsp;
rediscovered by 1985, in the 1989 Notice of Review, this taxon was&nbsp;
again identified as category 3A. In the next Notice of Review on&nbsp;
November 15, 1994 (59 FR 58982), this species was reclassified as a&nbsp;
category 1 candidate for listing. Category 1 candidates were those taxa&nbsp;
for which we had on file sufficient information on biological&nbsp;
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals.&nbsp;
Beginning with our February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596), we&nbsp;
discontinued the designation of multiple categories of candidates, and&nbsp;
only those taxa meeting the definition of former category 1 candidates&nbsp;
are now considered candidates for listing purposes. In the February 28,&nbsp;
1996, Notice of Review, we identified Blackburn's sphinx moth as a&nbsp;
candidate species (61 FR 7596). A proposed rule to list Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth as endangered was published on April 2, 1997 (62 FR 15640).&nbsp;
In the September 19, 1997, Notice of Review (62 FR 49398), this species&nbsp;
was included as proposed for endangered status.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the proposed listing rule, we indicated designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the moth was not prudent because we believed a critical&nbsp;
habitat designation would not provide any additional benefit beyond&nbsp;
that provided through listing as endangered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final listing rule, listing the Blackburn's sphinx moth as&nbsp;
endangered, was published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2000&nbsp;
(65 FR 4770). In that final rule, we determined that critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for the moth would be prudent, and we also indicated that&nbsp;
we were not able to develop a proposed critical habitat designation for&nbsp;
the species at that time due to budgetary and workload constraints.

[[Page 40639]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 2, 2000, we were ordered by the U.S. District Court for the&nbsp;
District of Hawaii (in Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt,&nbsp;
Civil No. 99-00603 SOM/BMK) to publish the final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for Blackburn's sphinx moth by February 1, 2002. The&nbsp;
plaintiffs and the Service have entered into a consent decree stating&nbsp;
that we will jointly seek an extension of this deadline (Center for&nbsp;
Biological Diversity, et al. v. Norton, Civ. No. 01-2063 (JR) (D.D.C.);&nbsp;
October 2, 2001). This proposed rule is in response to these&nbsp;
requirements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 5, 2001, we mailed pre-proposal notification letters to&nbsp;
45 interested parties informing them that the Service was in the&nbsp;
process of designating critical habitat for the Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
and requesting from them information on management of lands that&nbsp;
currently or recently (within the past 25 years) supported the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth. The letters contained a fact sheet describing&nbsp;
the Blackburn's sphinx moth and critical habitat and a questionnaire&nbsp;
designed to gather information about land management practices, which&nbsp;
we requested be returned to us by February 1, 2001. We received 18&nbsp;
responses to our interested parties mailing. Additionally, we met with&nbsp;
several researchers and land managers to obtain more specific&nbsp;
information on management activities and suitability of certain habitat&nbsp;
areas for the Blackburn's sphinx moth. The responses to our&nbsp;
notification letters and meetings included information on current land&nbsp;
management activities, detailed management plans, new locality&nbsp;
information for adult and larval moths, and new locality information&nbsp;
for the Blackburn's sphinx moth's host plants.

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as--(i) the&nbsp;
specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a species, at the&nbsp;
time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those&nbsp;
physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the species and (II) that may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographic area&nbsp;
occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon determination that&nbsp;
such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.&nbsp;
``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and procedures that are&nbsp;
necessary to bring an endangered species or a threatened species to the&nbsp;
point at which listing under the Act is no longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
through the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat with regard to actions carried out, funded, or&nbsp;
authorized by a Federal agency. Section 7 also requires consultation on&nbsp;
Federal actions likely to affect critical habitat. Aside from the added&nbsp;
protection that may be provided under section 7, the Act does not&nbsp;
provide other forms of protection to lands designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat. Because consultation under section 7 of the Act does not apply&nbsp;
to activities on private or other non-Federal lands which do not&nbsp;
involve a Federal nexus, critical habitat designation would not afford&nbsp;
any additional regulatory protections under the Act against such&nbsp;
activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat also provides non-regulatory benefits to the&nbsp;
species by informing the public and private sectors of areas important&nbsp;
for species recovery and where conservation actions would be most&nbsp;
effective. Designation of critical habitat can help focus conservation&nbsp;
activities for a listed species by identifying areas containing the&nbsp;
physical and biological features essential for conservation of that&nbsp;
species, and can alert the public as well as land-managing agencies to&nbsp;
the importance of those areas. Critical habitat also identifies areas&nbsp;
that may require special management considerations or protection, and&nbsp;
may help provide protection to areas where significant threats to the&nbsp;
species have been identified or help to avoid accidental damage to such&nbsp;
areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be included in a critical habitat designation, the habitat must&nbsp;
first be ``essential to the conservation of the species.'' Critical&nbsp;
habitat designations identify, to the extent known using the best&nbsp;
scientific and commercial data available, habitat areas that provide&nbsp;
essential life cycle needs of the species (i.e., areas on which are&nbsp;
found the primary constituent elements, as defined at 50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(b)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 requires that we designate critical habitat based on what&nbsp;
we know at the time of the designation. When we designate critical&nbsp;
habitat at the time of listing or under court-ordered deadlines, we&nbsp;
will often not have sufficient information to identify all areas of&nbsp;
critical habitat. We are required, nevertheless, to make a decision&nbsp;
and, thus, must base our designations on the best information available&nbsp;
we have at that time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the geographic area occupied by the species, we will&nbsp;
designate only areas currently known to be essential. We will not&nbsp;
speculate about what areas might be found to be essential if better&nbsp;
information became available, or what areas may become essential over&nbsp;
time. If the information available at the time of designation does not&nbsp;
show that an area provides essential life cycle needs of the species,&nbsp;
then the area should not be included in the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our regulations state that, ``The Secretary shall designate as&nbsp;
critical habitat areas outside the geographic area presently occupied&nbsp;
by the species only when a designation limited to its present range&nbsp;
would be inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species'' (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(e)). Accordingly, when the best available scientific and&nbsp;
commercial data do not demonstrate that the conservation needs of the&nbsp;
species require designation of critical habitat outside of occupied&nbsp;
areas, we will not designate critical habitat in areas outside the&nbsp;
geographic area occupied by the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires that we take into consideration&nbsp;
the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any&nbsp;
particular area as critical habitat. We may exclude areas from critical&nbsp;
habitat designation when the benefits of exclusion outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of including the areas within critical habitat, provided the&nbsp;
exclusion will not result in extinction of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Policy on Information Standards Under the Act, published in the&nbsp;
Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34271), identifies criteria,&nbsp;
establishes procedures, and provides guidance to ensure that decisions&nbsp;
made by the Service represent the best scientific and commercial data&nbsp;
available. It requires Service biologists, to the extent consistent&nbsp;
with the Act and with the use of the best scientific and commercial&nbsp;
data available, to use primary and original sources of information as&nbsp;
the basis for recommendations to designate critical habitat. When&nbsp;
determining which areas are critical habitat, a primary source of&nbsp;
information is the listing package for the species. Additional&nbsp;
information may be obtained from a recovery plan, articles in peer-
reviewed journals, conservation plans developed by States and counties,&nbsp;
scientific status surveys and studies, biological assessments,&nbsp;
unpublished materials, and expert opinion or personal knowledge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitat is often dynamic, and species may move from one area to&nbsp;
another over time. Furthermore, because of the information available to&nbsp;
us at the time of designation, we recognize that designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat may not include all of the habitat areas that may

[[Page 40640]]

eventually be determined to be necessary for the conservation of the&nbsp;
species. For these reasons, critical habitat designations do not signal&nbsp;
that habitat outside the designation is unimportant or may not be&nbsp;
required for recovery. Areas outside the critical habitat designation&nbsp;
will continue to be subject to conservation actions that may be&nbsp;
implemented under section 7(a)(1) of the Act, and to the regulatory&nbsp;
protections afforded by the section 7(a)(2) jeopardy standard and the&nbsp;
take prohibitions of section 9 of the Act, as determined on the basis&nbsp;
of the best available information at the time of the action. Federally&nbsp;
funded or assisted projects affecting listed species outside their&nbsp;
designated critical habitat areas could still result in jeopardy&nbsp;
findings in some cases. Similarly, critical habitat designations made&nbsp;
on the basis of the best available information at the time of&nbsp;
designation will not control the direction and substance of future&nbsp;
recovery plans, habitat conservation plans, or other species&nbsp;
conservation planning efforts if new information available to these&nbsp;
planning efforts calls for a different outcome.

Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To identify and map areas essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth, we evaluated areas that contain dry and mesic&nbsp;
habitats as well as data on known moth occurrence. The best scientific&nbsp;
information available was analyzed, including peer-reviewed scientific&nbsp;
publications; unpublished reports by researchers; the rule listing the&nbsp;
species (65 FR 4770); the Blackburn's sphinx moth Recovery Outline&nbsp;
(Service 2000a); the Hawaii Natural Heritage Program (HHP) database;&nbsp;
field trip reports in our Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office&nbsp;
files; and responses to our moth critical habitat outreach package&nbsp;
mailed to Federal, State, private land managers, and other interested&nbsp;
parties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information that we received in response to our pre-proposal&nbsp;
outreach efforts was very helpful in developing this proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. Researchers at the Bishop Museum provided new&nbsp;
information about the moth's range and the potential effects of&nbsp;
nonnative predators and parasites. The Hawaii Division of Forestry of&nbsp;
Wildlife provided new information about the biology and distribution of&nbsp;
the host plants, new moth observation records, and information on the&nbsp;
management activities for State lands. The State Natural Area Reserve&nbsp;
Commission provided new information about the moth's biology and&nbsp;
information on management activities. The Kahoolawe Island Reserve&nbsp;
Commission provided new information on the moth's range, as well as&nbsp;
management activities for the management and restoration of Kahoolawe.&nbsp;
Researchers with the Biological Resource Division of the U.S.&nbsp;
Geological Survey, the National Tropical Botanical garden, and the&nbsp;
Hawaii Natural Heritage Program provided information concerning the&nbsp;
distribution of the moth and its host plants. Additional information&nbsp;
was received from the Hawaii Army National Guard (HIARNG) and the&nbsp;
Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blackburn's sphinx moth is short-lived, extremely mobile, and&nbsp;
rare; hence population densities are not easily determined (Janzen&nbsp;
1984; A. Medeiros, pers comm., 1998; Roderick and Gillespie 1997; Van&nbsp;
Gelder and Conant 1998). Even if the threats responsible for the&nbsp;
decline of the moth were controlled, the persistence of existing&nbsp;
populations is hampered by the small number of extant populations and&nbsp;
the small number of individuals in known populations. This circumstance&nbsp;
makes the moth more vulnerable to extinction due to a variety of&nbsp;
natural processes. Small populations are particularly vulnerable to&nbsp;
reduced reproductive vigor caused by inbreeding depression, and they&nbsp;
may suffer a loss of genetic variability over time due to random&nbsp;
genetic drift, resulting in decreased evolutionary potential and&nbsp;
ability to cope with environmental change ( IUCN 1994; Lande 1988).&nbsp;
Small populations are also demographically vulnerable to extinction&nbsp;
caused by random fluctuations in population size and sex ratio and to&nbsp;
catastrophes such as hurricanes (Lande 1988). We believe the existing&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth populations on Kahoolawe, Hawaii, and Maui are&nbsp;
insufficient to ensure the long-term survival of the species. Re-
establishing the species to a diverse set of habitats and climates&nbsp;
within its former range is necessary to remove the long-term risk of&nbsp;
range-wide extinction of the species due to catastrophic events and the&nbsp;
numerous direct threats to the species and its habitat (Service 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Janzen (1984) described the characteristics of tropical sphingid&nbsp;
moths found in a Costa Rican National Park. In general, adult sphingids&nbsp;
are nocturnal or crepuscular (dusk-flying) and regularly drink with a&nbsp;
long proboscis from many kinds of sphingophilous flowers while hovering&nbsp;
in front of them. Sphingophilus flowers are characterized by lightly-
colored, tubular corollas, evening athesis (opening), and nocturnal&nbsp;
nectar and scent production (Haber and Frankie 1989). Fecundity was&nbsp;
unknown, but estimated in the hundreds if the female can feed freely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly helpful in understanding the conservation needs of&nbsp;
sphingids is Janzen's description of the adult moth biological&nbsp;
characteristics, including that they have large latitudinal ranges,&nbsp;
feed heavily over a long period of time and extensively at spatially&nbsp;
particulate resources relatively fixed in location (i.e., they feed on&nbsp;
specific resources spread throughout the landscape), live for weeks to&nbsp;
months, lay few eggs per night, probably oviposit (deposit eggs) on&nbsp;
many host plant individuals and repeatedly visit many of them, have&nbsp;
less synchronous eclosion (emergence from the pupa) during the rainy&nbsp;
season than other moths, migrate, and are highly mobile, repeatedly&nbsp;
returning to the same food plants. In another study of sphingids,&nbsp;
adults were reported to travel greater distances to pollinate and visit&nbsp;
flowers than those distances traveled by other insect pollinators or&nbsp;
even hummingbirds (Linhart and Mendenhall 1977).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sphingid caterpillars are known to feed heavily over a long time&nbsp;
period and eat limited types of foliage, typically plants rich in toxic&nbsp;
small molecules (e.g., in the family Solanaceae). They also have less&nbsp;
synchronous eclosion (emergence from the pupa) than other moths. Since&nbsp;
sphingids search widely for local good conditions, Janzen concluded&nbsp;
that isolated habitats may have difficulty supporting sphingid&nbsp;
populations (i.e., connectivity between habitat areas is necessary to&nbsp;
support wide-ranging sphingid species).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehrlich and Murphy (1987) noted populations of herbivorous insects&nbsp;
such as lepidopterans are often regulated by environmental factors,&nbsp;
such as weather conditions, and thus small populations can be&nbsp;
particularly at risk of extinction. Ehrlich and Murphy identified a&nbsp;
number of principles important for the conservation of herbivorous&nbsp;
insects. First, in most cases, a series of diverse demographic units&nbsp;
will typically be needed to conserve a species. Second, where possible,&nbsp;
corridors among the sites should be established to promote re-
colonizations in areas where the species once occurred. Lastly, they&nbsp;
noted that when populations are very sensitive to environmental changes&nbsp;
and limited information is available on the species population biology,&nbsp;
it is easy to underestimate the conservation needs of such insects.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murphy et al. (1990) also noted that reviews of butterfly&nbsp;
population ecology demonstrate that environmental factors play&nbsp;
important roles in determining

[[Page 40641]]

butterfly population dynamics. They stated that most documented&nbsp;
population extinctions have resulted from habitat deterioration&nbsp;
combined with extreme weather events. Decreases in the quality or&nbsp;
abundance of larval host plants and adult nectar sources are caused by&nbsp;
changes in plant community composition, particularly changes associated&nbsp;
with succession, disturbance, and grazing regimes. But, because many&nbsp;
butterfly species are especially sensitive to thermal conditions,&nbsp;
habitat changes which disrupt microclimatic regimes can cause habitat&nbsp;
deterioration without elimination of plant resources. Ehrlich and&nbsp;
Murphy (1987) noted several patterns within typical butterfly&nbsp;
populations: a number of subpopulations within a given species&nbsp;
metapopulation are often extirpated and later re-colonized; and a given&nbsp;
species may not be present in many of its habitat remnants, including&nbsp;
within those containing the highest host plant diversity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act provides that areas outside the&nbsp;
geographical area currently occupied by the species may meet the&nbsp;
definition of critical habitat upon determination that they are&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the species. Although our knowledge&nbsp;
of the moth's historical range is incomplete, we believe the existing&nbsp;
natural habitats needed to support viable populations of the moth are&nbsp;
too small, isolated, and seriously threatened to ensure its long-term&nbsp;
protection or conservation, particularly in light of the foraging needs&nbsp;
of adult sphingid moths (Janzen 1984) and the apparent wide-ranging&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth foraging habits (HHP 2000; F. Duvall, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 2001; B. Gagne, pers. comm., 2001; D. Hopper, in litt., 2000,&nbsp;
2002). Long-term conservation of the species will require the&nbsp;
protection and subsequent restoration of additional and larger areas of&nbsp;
dry and mesic habitat that includes the larval and adult primary&nbsp;
constituent elements at different elevational and rainfall gradients to&nbsp;
improve the likelihood of successful larval development and adult moth&nbsp;
foraging (A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1998; Roderick and Gillespie 1997;&nbsp;
Van Gelder and Conant 1998). The long-term persistence of the existing&nbsp;
populations would improve if they could be increased in size and if the&nbsp;
connectivity among the populations was enhanced, thus promoting&nbsp;
dispersal of individuals across intervening lands, and conserving and&nbsp;
restoring moth populations in multiple locations would decrease the&nbsp;
likelihood that the effect of any single alien parasite or predator or&nbsp;
combined pressure of such species could result in the diminished vigor&nbsp;
or extinction of the moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molokai is an example of essential habitat because it provides for&nbsp;
the expansion of the species' range and for improved connectivity of&nbsp;
the different populations. While the proposed unit on this island is&nbsp;
not known to currently harbor a moth population, preserving this&nbsp;
habitat is important because some threats to the species are absent&nbsp;
there (Table 1 shows several of the potential moth predators and&nbsp;
parasites are not reported on this island). Likewise, because of&nbsp;
Molokai's distance from islands currently inhabited by the moth, we&nbsp;
believe proposed critical habitat on this island will be extremely&nbsp;
important for the species' conservation as it would help to protect the&nbsp;
species from extinction by catastrophic events, which could impact&nbsp;
other more closely grouped populations (e.g., those on the Maui or on&nbsp;
the island of Hawaii). For these reasons, we find that inclusion of an&nbsp;
area such as on Molokai, identified as containing the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements is essential to the conservation of the species&nbsp;
even if it does not currently contain known moth populations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The critical habitat unit approach in this proposed rule addresses&nbsp;
the numerous risks to the long-term survival and conservation of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth by employing two widely recognized and&nbsp;
scientifically accepted methods for promoting viable populations of&nbsp;
imperiled species--(1) Creation or maintenance of multiple populations&nbsp;
to reduce the threat of a single or series of catastrophic events&nbsp;
extirpating the species; and (2) increasing the size of each population&nbsp;
in the respective critical habitat units to a level where the threats&nbsp;
of genetic, demographic, and normal environmental uncertainties are&nbsp;
diminished (Meffe and Carroll 1996; Service 1997; Tear et al. 1995).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the larger the number of populations and the larger the&nbsp;
size of each population, the lower the probability of extinction (Meffe&nbsp;
and Carroll 1996; Raup 1991). This basic conservation principle of&nbsp;
redundancy applies to Blackburn's sphinx moth. By maintaining viable&nbsp;
populations in the proposed critical habitat units, the threats&nbsp;
represented by a fluctuating environment are reduced and the species&nbsp;
has a greater likelihood of achieving long-term survival and&nbsp;
conservation. Conversely, loss of a Blackburn's sphinx moth critical&nbsp;
habitat unit will result in an appreciable increase in the risk that&nbsp;
the species may not recover and survive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the species' presently reduced range, the Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth is now more susceptible to the variations and weather fluctuations&nbsp;
affecting quality and quantity of available habitat and food.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the moth is now more susceptible to direct pressure from&nbsp;
numerous nonnative insect predators and parasites. For these reasons&nbsp;
and the reasons discussed above, those areas currently occupied would&nbsp;
be inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species, and we have&nbsp;
proposed to designate eight units on four islands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are developing a draft recovery plan for this species. The&nbsp;
overall objective of this recovery plan will be to ensure the species'&nbsp;
long-term conservation and identify research necessary so the moth can&nbsp;
be reclassified to threatened and ultimately removed from the lists of&nbsp;
endangered and threatened species. Because a recovery plan for the moth&nbsp;
has not yet been completed, in making this determination we evaluated&nbsp;
the remaining potential habitat, the biological and life history&nbsp;
characteristics of the moth, and the best available scientific&nbsp;
information on conservation planning to obtain what we currently&nbsp;
believe will be required to ensure viable populations of this species.&nbsp;
However, if after completing the recovery planning process, should our&nbsp;
understanding of what areas support essential features for the&nbsp;
conservation of the moth change, to the extent our resources and other&nbsp;
duties will allow, we would revise any existing critical habitat&nbsp;
designation accordingly.

Primary Constituent Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act and regulations at&nbsp;
50 CFR 424.12(b), in determining which areas to designate as critical&nbsp;
habitat, we must consider those physical and biological features&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the species, and which may require&nbsp;
special management considerations and protection. These include, but&nbsp;
are not limited to, space for individual and population growth and for&nbsp;
normal behavior; food, water, or other nutritional or physiological&nbsp;
requirements; cover or shelter; and sites for breeding, reproduction,&nbsp;
or egg laying. To the extent possible, these biological and physical&nbsp;
elements, also known as primary constituent elements are, to be&nbsp;
described with the critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary constituent elements for the Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
include specific habitat components identified as essential for the&nbsp;
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, maturation,&nbsp;
dispersal, breeding, and egg

[[Page 40642]]

laying, and are organized by life cycle stage. The primary constituent&nbsp;
elements required by the Blackburn's sphinx moth larvae for foraging,&nbsp;
sheltering, maturation, and dispersal are the two documented host plant&nbsp;
species within the endemic Nothocestrum genus (N. latifolium and N.&nbsp;
breviflorum) and the dry and mesic habitats between the elevations of&nbsp;
sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) and receiving between 25 and 250 cm&nbsp;
(10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation which currently support or&nbsp;
historically have supported these plants. The primary constituent&nbsp;
elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth adults for foraging,&nbsp;
sheltering, dispersal, breeding, and egg production are native, nectar-
supplying plants, including but not limited to Ipomoea indica (and&nbsp;
other species within the genus Ipomoea), Capparis sandwichiana, and&nbsp;
Plumbago zeylanica and the dry to mesic habitats between the elevations&nbsp;
of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) and receiving between 25 and 250 cm&nbsp;
(10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation which currently support or&nbsp;
historically have supported these plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the larval and adult food plants are found in undeveloped&nbsp;
areas supporting mesic and dry habitats, typically receiving less than&nbsp;
250 cm (100 in) of rain per year and are located between the elevations&nbsp;
of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft). Vegetative communities in these&nbsp;
areas include native plants, and in some instances, introduced plant&nbsp;
species (A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1998; Roderick and Gillespie 1997;&nbsp;
Van Gelder and Conant 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Blackburn's sphinx moth larvae feed on the nonnative&nbsp;
Nicotiana glauca, we do not consider this plant to be a primary&nbsp;
constituent element for the designation of critical habitat. As&nbsp;
previously discussed, the native Nothocestrum species are more stable&nbsp;
and persistent components of dry to mesic forest habitats than the&nbsp;
Nicotiana glauca. Nicotiana glauca is a short-lived species that may&nbsp;
disappear from areas during prolonged drought (A. Medeiros, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 1998) or during successional changes in the plant community (F.&nbsp;
Howarth, pers. comm., 2001; Symon 1999). Many studies have shown that&nbsp;
insects, and particularly lepidopteran larvae, consume more food when&nbsp;
the food has a relatively high water content (Murugan and George 1992).&nbsp;
Relative consumption rate and growth have been reported to decrease for&nbsp;
many sphingids (closely related to the Blackburn's sphinx moth) when&nbsp;
raised on host plants or diets with a relatively low water content&nbsp;
(Murugan and George 1992). Nicotiana glauca's vulnerability to drought&nbsp;
conditions suggests that its water content frequently may not be&nbsp;
suitable for optimal growth of Blackburn's sphinx moth larvae.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restoration of native host species for the moth and other&nbsp;
endangered species may also require the control or elimination of&nbsp;
nonnative vegetation. Additionally, unlike the Nothocestrum species,&nbsp;
Nicotiana glauca is more likely to occur in habitats less suitable due&nbsp;
to their occupation by alien insect predators (D. Hopper, Service, in&nbsp;
litt., 2000, 2002; Symon 1999). Therefore, in comparison with Nicotiana&nbsp;
glauca, the native Nothocestrum species better fulfill the primary&nbsp;
biological needs of the moth larvae. For all of these reasons, we are&nbsp;
not considering Nicotiana glauca as a primary constituent element for&nbsp;
the designation of critical habitat at this time.

Criteria Used To Identify Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used several criteria to identify and select lands proposed for&nbsp;
designation as critical habitat. We began with all areas that we&nbsp;
believe are currently occupied by the moth. We then added other&nbsp;
unoccupied lands containing the primary constituent elements that are&nbsp;
needed for conservation of the species. As discussed in the Methods&nbsp;
section, in deciding which unoccupied areas were needed for&nbsp;
conservation we based our decision on the amount of available habitat&nbsp;
remaining that could potentially support the moth, the biology of the&nbsp;
moth, and information gained from the conservation of other herbivorous&nbsp;
insects. We gave preference to lands that--(a) are known to contain&nbsp;
largely intact assemblages of the host plant communities, and (b) form&nbsp;
contiguous, relatively large areas of suitable habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular flight distances of sphingids in Central America may be&nbsp;
greater than 10 km (6.2 mi) (Janzen 1984), and given the large size and&nbsp;
strong flight capabilities of the Blackburn's sphinx moth, the species&nbsp;
is believed to use large areas of habitat. Therefore, moth population&nbsp;
linkages will likely be enhanced if designated habitat occurs in large&nbsp;
contiguous blocks or within a matrix of undeveloped habitat (McIntyre&nbsp;
and Barrett 1992; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1998; S. Montgomery, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 2001; Roderick and Gillespie 1997; Van Gelder and Conant 1998).&nbsp;
To the extent possible with the limited potential habitat remaining, we&nbsp;
have attempted to account for the wide-ranging behavior of the moth.&nbsp;
Since the Blackburn's sphinx moth is believed to be a strong flier and&nbsp;
is able to move many kilometers from one area to another, areas of&nbsp;
larval or adult presence and feeding may be separated from similar&nbsp;
habitat areas and still serve important functions in maintaining moth&nbsp;
populations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some small habitat areas are also suitable for Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth larvae (e.g., Unit 3 and Units 5a and 5b discussed below) and are&nbsp;
critical for the conservation of the moth since such habitats may&nbsp;
facilitate adult moth dispersal and promote genetic exchange between&nbsp;
populations located on different islands. These areas also provide&nbsp;
nectar resources and sheltering opportunities required by the adult&nbsp;
moth. As discussed earlier, small, geographically isolated populations&nbsp;
may be subject to decreased viability caused by inbreeding depression,&nbsp;
reductions in effective population size due to random variation in sex&nbsp;
ratio, and limited capacity to evolve in response to environmental&nbsp;
change (Soule 1987).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackburn's sphinx moth populations fluctuate from year to year and&nbsp;
season to season, apparently correlated with environmental and climatic&nbsp;
variation. The moth is likely sensitive to thermal conditions and&nbsp;
habitat changes which disrupt its micro-climatic requirements.&nbsp;
Therefore, proposed critical habitat boundaries include dry and mesic&nbsp;
habitats containing the primary constituent elements along wide&nbsp;
elevational gradients to better ensure adult moth foraging needs up and&nbsp;
downslope within its range. Furthermore, the boundaries include&nbsp;
elevational gradients to better ensure larval host plant availability&nbsp;
during periods of drought. The growth rates of larvae for many closely&nbsp;
related sphingid species are reported to decrease when their host&nbsp;
plants lack suitable water content. In fact, suitable host plant water&nbsp;
content can improve the later fecundity of the adult stage (Murugan and&nbsp;
George 1992). It is believed numerous habitat elevations, containing&nbsp;
the various primary constituent elements, are necessary for successful&nbsp;
conservation of the species (Ehrlich and Murphy 1987; Murphy and Weiss&nbsp;
1988; Murphy et al. 1990; Shaffer 1987) to minimize the effects of&nbsp;
annual localized drought conditions throughout different areas of the&nbsp;
species' host plant range (Murugan and George 1992).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many sphingid studies have shown that air temperature restricts&nbsp;
adult feeding activity above a certain temperature (usually 30 degrees&nbsp;
Celsius) (Herrera 1992). This highlights the importance of protecting&nbsp;
sufficiently large habitat areas throughout the Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
range to ensure nectar resource availability as

[[Page 40643]]

temperatures change within the habitat range seasonally, during the&nbsp;
night, and along elevational gradients. Increasing the potential for&nbsp;
adult dispersal will help to alleviate many threats, thus, habitat&nbsp;
which provides the primary constituent elements associated with adult&nbsp;
dispersal and feeding is essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is proposed on those Hawaiian Islands where the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth's primary constituent elements considered&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the species are known to occur. This&nbsp;
will allow the species the ability to persist and re-colonize areas&nbsp;
where it has become extirpated due to catastrophic events or&nbsp;
demographic stochasticity (randomness) (Shaffer 1987). For example, on&nbsp;
the island of Kauai in 1992, Hurricane Iniki blew over large areas of&nbsp;
native forest leaving open areas where nonnative plants became&nbsp;
established and created paths for further invasion of nonnative&nbsp;
animals, both of which have been identified as threats to the survival&nbsp;
of the moth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small habitats tend to support small populations, which frequently&nbsp;
are extirpated by events that are part of normal environmental&nbsp;
variation. The continued existence of such satellite populations&nbsp;
requires the presence of one or more large reservoir populations, which&nbsp;
may provide colonists to smaller, outlying habitat patches (Ehrlich and&nbsp;
Murphy 1987). Based on recent field observations of the moth, we&nbsp;
believe the species likely occurs within two regional populations on&nbsp;
separate islands, one centered in the Kanaio area of leeward East Maui&nbsp;
(Unit 1--see Proposed Critical Habitat Designation, below), and one&nbsp;
centered near Puuwaawaa (Unit 6) of Hawaii Island, north of Kailua-Kona&nbsp;
(F. Howarth, pers. comm., 2001; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1998). Both&nbsp;
of these two areas contain populations of the moth regarded as probable&nbsp;
source areas or ``reservoirs'' (Murphy et al. 1990) for dispersing or&nbsp;
colonizing moth adults. We are also proposing areas (e.g., Auwahi&nbsp;
Forest and portions of Ulupalukua Ranch, both within Unit 1; and Unit 4&nbsp;
on Kahoolawe) that are large, mixed-quality habitat patches containing&nbsp;
the primary constituent elements and located within several kilometers&nbsp;
of the two potential reservoir populations. Because of their current&nbsp;
occupancy and their proximity to larger populations, it appears likely&nbsp;
that they will be the areas most rapidly re-colonized by the moth after&nbsp;
potential extirpations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designation of small habitat areas close to the two large&nbsp;
reservoir areas is also proposed to promote genetic variability in the&nbsp;
moth population, contributing to the long-term persistence and&nbsp;
conservation of the species. These areas will serve as stepping stones&nbsp;
or corridors for dispersing adult moths or as overflow habitat during&nbsp;
particularly fecund years, which could be very important to the&nbsp;
integrity of moth populations. For example, adult moths observed at&nbsp;
Ahihi-Kinau NAR (Unit 1) on Maui may have originated from larval host&nbsp;
plants located in the Kanaio NAR (also Unit 1), or moths seen in&nbsp;
Kailua-Kona (Units 5-A and 5-B) from Puuwaawaa (Unit 6). The&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth populations inhabiting these smaller habitat&nbsp;
areas appear to be taking advantage of lower elevation adult native&nbsp;
host plants and nonnative host plants such as tree tobacco upon which&nbsp;
the larval stage is completed successfully. In addition, these small&nbsp;
habitat areas may be able to support persistent moth populations&nbsp;
independent of the reservoir areas, significantly contributing to&nbsp;
conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural areas of suitable native, dry to mesic habitat containing&nbsp;
at least one Nothocestrum plant adjacent or near other Nothocestrum&nbsp;
populations are included in the proposed critical habitat units. We&nbsp;
have included suitable habitat without Nothocestrum larval host plants,&nbsp;
provided it contained the adult primary constituent elements, including&nbsp;
but not limited to Ipomoea species, Capparis sandwichiana, or Plumbago&nbsp;
zeylanica. This is especially true for areas lying between or adjacent&nbsp;
to large populations of Nothocestrum species and which could serve as a&nbsp;
flight corridor or ``stepping stone'' to other larger host plant&nbsp;
habitat areas. An area may also serve as a stepping stone when it&nbsp;
contains adult native host plants thereby providing foraging&nbsp;
opportunities for adults. Areas with larval nonnative host plants&nbsp;
(e.g., Unit 3 on Maui and Unit 4 on Kahoolawe) may also serve as areas&nbsp;
for population expansion during especially wet years when the nonnative&nbsp;
larval host plants experience rapid growth. Natural areas of primarily&nbsp;
native vegetation containing the larval or adult stage primary&nbsp;
constituent elements and where habitat could support a moth population&nbsp;
and increase the potential for conservation are also proposed to be&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat. The designation and protection of a&nbsp;
unit not known to currently contain a moth population (i.e., the unit&nbsp;
on Molokai), but which contains the PCE's and lacks some of the serious&nbsp;
threats to the species, (see Table 1) will enhance population expansion&nbsp;
and connectivity, thereby improving the likelihood of the species'&nbsp;
conservation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The areas we are proposing to designate as critical habitat provide&nbsp;
some or all of the known primary constituent elements for this species.&nbsp;
These areas are on the islands of Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Molokai&nbsp;
between the elevations of sea level to 1,525 m (5,000 ft) within dry to&nbsp;
mesic shrub lands or forests containing one or more populations of the&nbsp;
adult host plants, or one or more populations of Nothocestrum&nbsp;
latifolium or N. breviflorum. Proposed critical habitat boundaries&nbsp;
include aggregations of native host plant habitat for both larvae and&nbsp;
adults, and encompass the areas and flight corridors believed necessary&nbsp;
to sustain moth populations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the long-term survival and recovery of the Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth requires the designation of eight critical habitat units on&nbsp;
four of the main Hawaiian Islands. One of these habitat units is&nbsp;
currently not known to be occupied by the Blackburn's sphinx moth. To&nbsp;
recover the species, it will be necessary to conserve suitable habitat&nbsp;
in this unoccupied unit, which in turn will allow for the establishment&nbsp;
of an additional Blackburn's sphinx moth population(s) through natural&nbsp;
recruitment or managed re-introductions. Establishment of this&nbsp;
additional moth population(s) will increase the likelihood that the&nbsp;
species will survive and recover in the face of normal and random&nbsp;
events (e.g., hurricanes, fire, alien species introductions, etc.)&nbsp;
(Mangel and Tier 1994; Pimm et al. 1998; Stacy and Taper 1992).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of scientific data on Blackburn's sphinx moth life history&nbsp;
makes it impossible for us to develop a quantitative model (e.g.,&nbsp;
population viability analysis (NRC 1995)) to identify the optimal&nbsp;
number, size, and location of critical habitat units (Bessinger and&nbsp;
Westphal 1998; Ginzburg et al. 1990; Karieva and Wennergren 1995;&nbsp;
Menges 1990; Murphy et al. 1990; Taylor 1995). At this time, we are&nbsp;
only able to conclude that the current size and distribution of the&nbsp;
extant populations are not sufficient to expect a reasonable&nbsp;
probability of the Blackburn's sphinx moth's long-term survival and&nbsp;
recovery. Therefore, we used the best available information, including&nbsp;
scientific opinion and professional judgement of non-Service&nbsp;
scientists, to identify as critical habitat a reasonable number of&nbsp;
additional units. Conservation of more than eight units could further&nbsp;
increase the probability

[[Page 40644]]

that the species will survive and recover; however, establishing and&nbsp;
conserving viable moth populations on a total of eight discrete units&nbsp;
on four islands will provide the species with a reasonable expectation&nbsp;
of persistence and eventual recovery, even with the high potential that&nbsp;
one or more of these subpopulations will be temporarily lost as a&nbsp;
result of normal or random adverse events (Mangel and Tier 1994; Pimm&nbsp;
et al. 1998; Stacey and Taper 1992).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The areas we are proposing to designate as critical habitat&nbsp;
currently provide some or all of the habitat components necessary to&nbsp;
meet the primary biological needs of the Blackburn's sphinx moth. Lands&nbsp;
designated are under Federal, private, and State ownership. Lands&nbsp;
proposed as critical habitat have been divided into eight critical&nbsp;
habitat units.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are proposing to designate critical habitat on lands considered&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the moth. Conserving the moth includes&nbsp;
the need to re-establish historic and possibly, extirpated populations&nbsp;
of Blackburn's sphinx moth to areas within one of the critical habitat&nbsp;
units, which represent a range of habitat and climate conditions within&nbsp;
the moth's former range. Re-establishing the species to a diverse set&nbsp;
of habitats and climates containing the primary constituent elements is&nbsp;
necessary to reduce the long-term risk of range-wide extinction of the&nbsp;
species (Service 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brief description of each unit, and reasons for proposing to&nbsp;
designate it as critical habitat are presented below.

Unit 1: Ahihi-Kinau NAR--Ulupalakua--Auwahi--Kanaio Unit (Maui)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 1 consists of approximately 15,216 ha (37,599 ac) encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the leeward slope of Haleakala. The unit is bounded on the&nbsp;
northeast by the 1,525 m (5,000 ft) elevation contour of Haleakala&nbsp;
Volcano, to the south by the ocean, to the east by the dry coast and&nbsp;
slopes toward Kaupo Gap, and on the west by the Haleakala Southwest&nbsp;
Ridge. Natural features within the unit include widely spread, remnant&nbsp;
dry forest communities, rocky coastline, numerous cindercones, and some&nbsp;
of the most recent lava flows on Maui. Vegetation consists primarily of&nbsp;
mixed-species mesic, and dry forest communities composed of native and&nbsp;
introduced plants, with smaller amounts of dry coastal shrub land (HHP&nbsp;
1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains what is probably the largest, extant moth&nbsp;
population or meta-population. This unit is essential to the species'&nbsp;
conservation because it contains native (Nothocestrum latifolium) and&nbsp;
other nectar-supplying plants for adult moths. In addition to providing&nbsp;
essential habitat for the Maui meta-population, areas within this unit&nbsp;
provides temporary (ephemeral) habitat for migrating Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moths.

Unit 2: Puu O Kali Unit (Maui)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2 consists of approximately 2,750 ha (6,794 ac) encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the leeward slope of Haleakala, and adjacent portions of&nbsp;
the upper, southeast isthmus. The unit is bounded on the north and to&nbsp;
the south by pasture lands, to the east by the lower slopes of&nbsp;
Haleakala below the area of Kula, and on the west by the coastal town&nbsp;
of Kihei. Natural features within the unit include widely spread,&nbsp;
remnant dry forest communities, rugged aa lava flows, and numerous&nbsp;
cindercones including the highly visible, Puu O Kali. Vegetation&nbsp;
consists primarily of mixed-species mesic, and dry forest communities&nbsp;
composed of native and introduced plants, with smaller amounts of dry&nbsp;
coastal shrub land (HHP 1993). This unit is essential to the species'&nbsp;
conservation because it contains native nectar-supplying plants for&nbsp;
adult, and areas within this unit provide temporary (ephemeral) habitat&nbsp;
for migrating Blackburn's sphinx moths.

Unit 3: Kanaha Pond--Spreckelsville Unit (Maui)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 3 consists of approximately 226 ha (559 ac) encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the Kahului coastland and the Kanaha Pond State Sanctuary&nbsp;
on Maui. It is bounded on the south by the Kahului Airport, on the&nbsp;
north by the ocean, on the east by sugarcane fields, and to the west by&nbsp;
the town of Kahului. Natural features within the unit include Kanaha&nbsp;
Pond and remnant coastal dune communities. Vegetation consists&nbsp;
primarily of mixed-species, dry coastal shrub land communities composed&nbsp;
of native and introduced plants, including

[[Page 40645]]

nonnative larval host plants (HHP 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although devoid of naturally occurring Nothocestrum spp., the unit&nbsp;
contains adult moth primary constituent elements, and recent&nbsp;
observations of both larvae and adults have been documented in the&nbsp;
Kanaha-Spreckelsville area. This unit is also considered essential to&nbsp;
the species' conservation because evidence indicates that it provides&nbsp;
refuge for moths dispersing to other larger areas. Because it is a&nbsp;
State Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kanaha Pond portion of this unit is&nbsp;
currently managed to benefit resident native species and should benefit&nbsp;
the moth and its host plants to some extent (F. Duvall, DoFAW, in litt.&nbsp;
2001). Although this area is lower in elevation than areas containing&nbsp;
Nothocestrum and associated species, the persistent occurrence of&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth in this area suggests this site plays an&nbsp;
important role in moth population dynamics.

Unit 4: Upper Kahoolawe Unit (Kahoolawe)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 4 consists of approximately 1,878 ha (4,641 ac), encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the upper elevational contour of Kahoolawe, approximately&nbsp;
above 305 m (1,000 ft) in elevation. Kahoolawe is located approximately&nbsp;
11 km (6.7 mi) south of Maui Island and is approximately 11,655 ha&nbsp;
(28,800 ac) in total land area. Natural features within the unit&nbsp;
include the main caldera, Lua Makika, and Puu Moaulaiki. Vegetation&nbsp;
within the proposed unit consists primarily of mixed-species, mesic and&nbsp;
dry grass and shrubland communities composed of primarily introduced&nbsp;
plants and some native plant species (HHP 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains a large moth population, which may or may not be&nbsp;
part of the larger Maui populations. No native Nothocestrum species&nbsp;
currently occur, but introduced tree tobacco is very common as are&nbsp;
numerous native adult host plants as described by the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Currently, the entire island is devoid of&nbsp;
ungulates and is managed for control of fire and nonnative species to&nbsp;
some degree. Because the unit harbors adult native host plants and is&nbsp;
in close proximity to the large Maui moth population, this unit is&nbsp;
essential for Blackburn's sphinx moth conservation and would improve&nbsp;
dispersal and migration corridors and thus expand population&nbsp;
recruitment potential. (P. Higashino, pers. comm., 2001).

Unit 5-A and Unit 5-B: Kailua-Kona Unit (Hawaii)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Units 5-A and 5-B consists of approximately 230 ha (567 ac)&nbsp;
encompassing portions of rugged lowland forest within the boundary of&nbsp;
the Kailua-Kona township on the island of Hawaii. They are bounded on&nbsp;
the south by Kailua-Kona town, on the north by rugged lava flows, to&nbsp;
the west by coastal nonnative plant communities, and to the east by&nbsp;
residential housing areas. Natural features within the units include&nbsp;
rugged lava flows. Vegetation consists primarily of mixed-species&nbsp;
mesic, and dry forest communities composed of native and introduced&nbsp;
plants, with smaller amounts of dry coastal shrubland (HHP 2000). These&nbsp;
units contains the endangered larval host plant, N. breviflorum. Adult&nbsp;
and larval moth sightings have been documented within these units. In&nbsp;
addition to providing habitat for this moth population, lands proposed&nbsp;
for designation in Units 5-A and 5-B will provide refugia for moths&nbsp;
migrating to other areas of existing suitable host plant habitat.

Unit 6: Puuwaawaa--Hualalai Meta-Unit (Hawaii)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 6 consists of approximately 18,111 ha (44,753 ac) encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the flows and northwest slopes of the Hualalai volcano on&nbsp;
the island of Hawaii. It is bounded on the south by the Kailua-Kona&nbsp;
region and large expanses of barren lava flows, on the north by Parker&nbsp;
Ranch and large expanses of nonnative grass lands, to the east by upper&nbsp;
slopes of Hualalai volcano, and to the west by lava flows and&nbsp;
coastland. Natural features within the unit include the Puuwaawaa&nbsp;
cindercone and significant stands of native, dry forest including large&nbsp;
numbers of Nothocestrum breviflorum host plants (Perry 2001).&nbsp;
Vegetation consists primarily of mixed-species mesic, and dry forest&nbsp;
communities composed of native and introduced plants, with smaller&nbsp;
amounts of dry coastal shrubland (HHP 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequent and persistent observations of both moth larvae and adults&nbsp;
throughout this unit indicate that this unit contains the largest&nbsp;
population of Blackburn's sphinx moth on the island of Hawaii. In&nbsp;
addition to providing habitat for this population, proposed lands in&nbsp;
Unit 6 provide refugia for migrating moths to other areas of existing&nbsp;
suitable host plant habitat. As previously discussed, given the large&nbsp;
size and strong flight capabilities of the Blackburn's sphinx moth,&nbsp;
support for moth population linkages requires habitat in large&nbsp;
contiguous blocks or within a matrix of undeveloped habitat (McIntyre&nbsp;
and Barrett 1992; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1998; S. Montgomery, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 2001; Roderick and Gillespie 1997; Van Gelder and Conant 1998).

Unit 7: Kamoko Flats--Puukolekole Unit (Molokai)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 7 consists of approximately 1,829 ha (4,520 ac) encompassing&nbsp;
portions of the higher, yet drier portions of east Molokai. It is&nbsp;
bounded on the north by wet forests, to the south by drier coastland,&nbsp;
to the east by rugged, dry gullies and valleys, and to the west by dry&nbsp;
to mesic, lowland forest. Natural features within the unit include&nbsp;
numerous forested ridges and gullies. Vegetation consists primarily of&nbsp;
mixed-species mesic, and dry forest communities composed of native and&nbsp;
introduced plants (HHP 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is part of the historical range of the moth. This unit is&nbsp;
not known to currently contain a moth population, but it does contain&nbsp;
native Nothocestrum host plants, including N. longifolium and N.&nbsp;
latifolium (Wood 2001a) as well as adult native host plants. Because&nbsp;
the Molokai unit contains both larval and adult native host plants and&nbsp;
is in close proximity to the large Maui population, this unit is&nbsp;
essential for Blackburn's sphinx moth conservation because it would&nbsp;
allow the species to expand into an area formerly part of its&nbsp;
historical range and in very close proximity to its current range on&nbsp;
the island of Maui. Furthermore, it may facilitate dispersal and&nbsp;
provide a flight corridor for moths eventually migrating to the island&nbsp;
of Oahu, also part of its historical range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to its proximity to the island of Maui where the current and&nbsp;
presumed highest historical concentration of Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
occurred and because this unit contains dry and mesic habitats which&nbsp;
are known, both currently and historically, to support the larval and&nbsp;
adult native host plants, researchers believe Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
will re-establish itself on this unit over time. (F. Howarth, pers.&nbsp;
comm., 2001). Furthermore, this unit lacks some of the serious&nbsp;
potential threats to the moth (see Table 1). Conserving and restoring&nbsp;
moth populations in multiple locations will decrease the likelihood&nbsp;
that the effect of any single alien parasite or predator or combined&nbsp;
pressure of such species and other threats could result in the&nbsp;
diminished vigor or extinction of the moth. Including this unit within&nbsp;
the designation will also reduce the possibility of the species'&nbsp;
extinction from catastrophic events impacting the

[[Page 40646]]

existing populations on other islands. Designating Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth critical habitat within this area on Molokai is complementary to&nbsp;
existing and planned management activities of the landowners. The&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat unit lies within a larger, existing,&nbsp;
conservation area to be managed for watershed conservation and the&nbsp;
conservation of endangered and rare species. The landowners, State and&nbsp;
Federal resource agencies, and local citizens groups are involved with&nbsp;
these planned natural resource management activities on Molokai.

Application of the Section 3(5)(A) Criteria Regarding Special&nbsp;
Management Considerations or Protection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the definition of critical habitat in section 3 of the&nbsp;
Act, any area so designated must also require ``special management&nbsp;
considerations or protections.'' Special management and protection are&nbsp;
not required if adequate management and protection are already in&nbsp;
place. Adequate special management or protection is provided by a&nbsp;
legally operative plan or agreement that addresses the maintenance and&nbsp;
improvement of the primary constituent elements important to the&nbsp;
species and manages for the long-term conservation of the species. If&nbsp;
any areas containing the primary constituent elements are currently&nbsp;
being managed to address the conservation needs of Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth and do not require special management or protection, such areas&nbsp;
would not be included in a critical habitat designation because they&nbsp;
would not meet the definition of critical habitat in section 3(5)(A)(i)&nbsp;
of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used the following three guidelines to determine if a plan&nbsp;
provides adequate management or protection--(1) A current plan&nbsp;
specifying the management actions must be complete and provide&nbsp;
sufficient conservation benefit to the species, (2) the plan must&nbsp;
provide assurances that the conservation management strategies will be&nbsp;
implemented, and (3) the plan must provide assurances that the&nbsp;
conservation management strategies will be effective. In determining if&nbsp;
management strategies are likely to be implemented, we considered&nbsp;
whether: (1) A management plan or agreement exists that specifies the&nbsp;
management actions being implemented or to be implemented; (2) there is&nbsp;
a timely schedule for implementation; (3) there is a high probability&nbsp;
that the funding source(s) or other resources necessary to implement&nbsp;
the actions will be available; and (4) the party(ies) have the&nbsp;
authority and long-term commitment to the agreement or plan to&nbsp;
implement the management actions, as demonstrated, for example, by a&nbsp;
legal instrument providing enduring protection and management of the&nbsp;
lands. In determining whether an action is likely to be effective, we&nbsp;
considered whether: (1) The plan specifically addresses the management&nbsp;
needs, including reduction of threats to the species; (2) such actions&nbsp;
have been successful in the past; (3) there are provisions for&nbsp;
monitoring and assessment of the effectiveness of the management&nbsp;
actions; and (4) adaptive management principles have been incorporated&nbsp;
into the plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on information provided to us by land owners and managers to&nbsp;
date, we find that no areas are adequately managed and protected to&nbsp;
address the threats to Blackburn's sphinx moth. Several areas,&nbsp;
especially within Units 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are covered under current&nbsp;
management plans and are being managed in a manner that meets some of&nbsp;
the conservation needs of Blackburn's sphinx moth including fire and&nbsp;
ungulate management. However, we find that in none of these areas does&nbsp;
the present management adequately address the needs of the species by&nbsp;
reducing all of the primary threats to this species including the loss&nbsp;
of host plant fecundity. Furthermore, all of the plans lack a timely&nbsp;
schedule for implementation; a high probability of funding source(s) or&nbsp;
other resources necessary to implement the necessary actions; and&nbsp;
sufficient landowner/management authority or long-term commitment to&nbsp;
implement the management actions, as demonstrated, for example, by a&nbsp;
legal instrument providing enduring protection and management of the&nbsp;
lands.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation

Section 7&nbsp; Consultation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies, including the&nbsp;
Service, to ensure that actions they fund, authorize, or carry out do&nbsp;
not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Destruction or&nbsp;
adverse modification occurs when a Federal action directly or&nbsp;
indirectly alters critical habitat to the extent that it appreciably&nbsp;
diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of the&nbsp;
species. Individuals, organizations, States, local governments, and&nbsp;
other non-Federal entities are affected by the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat only if their actions occur on Federal lands, require a Federal&nbsp;
permit, license, or other authorization, or involve Federal funding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their&nbsp;
actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as&nbsp;
endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if&nbsp;
any is designated or proposed. Regulations implementing this&nbsp;
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR&nbsp;
part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to&nbsp;
confer with us on any action that is likely to result in destruction or&nbsp;
adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. Conference reports&nbsp;
provide conservation recommendations to assist the agency in&nbsp;
eliminating conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action. The&nbsp;
conservation recommendations in a conference report are advisory. We&nbsp;
may issue a formal conference report if requested by a Federal agency.&nbsp;
Formal conference reports on proposed critical habitat contain a&nbsp;
biological opinion that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as if&nbsp;
critical habitat were designated. We may adopt the formal conference&nbsp;
report as the biological opinion when critical habitat is designated,&nbsp;
if no significant new information or changes in the action alter the&nbsp;
content of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7 of the Act and its implementing regulations require&nbsp;
Federal agencies to consult with us if a proposed action may affect a&nbsp;
listed species or its critical habitat (16 U.S.C. 1536; 50 CFR&nbsp;
402.14(a)). If after consultation, we issue a biological opinion&nbsp;
concluding that a project is likely to result in the destruction or&nbsp;
adverse modification of critical habitat, we also provide reasonable&nbsp;
and prudent alternatives to the project, if any are identifiable.&nbsp;
Reasonable and prudent alternatives are defined at 50 CFR 402.<b>02</b> as&nbsp;
alternative actions identified during consultation that can be&nbsp;
implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the&nbsp;
action, that are consistent with the scope of the Federal agency's&nbsp;
legal authority and jurisdiction, that are economically and&nbsp;
technologically feasible, and that the Director believes would avoid&nbsp;
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent alternatives can vary from slight project modifications to&nbsp;
extensive redesign or relocation of the project.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulations at 50 CFR 402.16 require Federal agencies to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation on previously reviewed actions in instances where critical&nbsp;
habitat is subsequently designated and the Federal agency has retained&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control over the action or such&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control is authorized by law.&nbsp;
Consequently, some Federal agencies may request re-initiation of&nbsp;
consultation with us on actions for

[[Page 40647]]

which formal consultation has been completed if those actions may&nbsp;
affect designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities on Federal lands that may affect the Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth or its critical habitat will require section 7 consultation.&nbsp;
Activities on non-Federal lands requiring a permit from a Federal&nbsp;
agency, such as a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers under&nbsp;
section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or some other Federal action,&nbsp;
including funding (e.g., the Federal Highway Administration, Federal&nbsp;
Aviation Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, or&nbsp;
Natural Resources Conservation Service) will also be subject to the&nbsp;
section 7 consultation process. Federal actions not affecting listed&nbsp;
species or critical habitat and actions on non-Federal lands that are&nbsp;
not federally funded or permitted do not require section 7&nbsp;
consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires us to evaluate briefly in any&nbsp;
proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat those&nbsp;
activities involving a Federal action that may adversely modify such&nbsp;
habitat or that may be affected by such designation. We note that such&nbsp;
activities may also jeopardize the continued existence of the species.&nbsp;
Activities that may directly or indirectly adversely affect critical&nbsp;
habitat include, but are not limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Removing, thinning, or destroying Blackburn's sphinx moth&nbsp;
habitat (as defined in the primary constituent elements discussion),&nbsp;
whether by burning, mechanical, chemical, or other means (e.g., wood&nbsp;
cutting, grading, overgrazing, construction, road building, mining,&nbsp;
herbicide application, etc.).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Appreciably decreasing habitat value or quality through&nbsp;
indirect effects (e.g., introduction or promotion of invasive plant&nbsp;
species, forest fragmentation, overgrazing, augmentation of feral&nbsp;
ungulate populations, water diversion or impoundment, groundwater&nbsp;
pumping, or other activities that alter water quality or quantity to an&nbsp;
extent that they affect vegetation structure) and activities that&nbsp;
increase the risk of fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal agencies already consult with us on activities in areas&nbsp;
currently occupied by the species to ensure that their actions do not&nbsp;
jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Thus, actions which&nbsp;
may already require consultation include, but are not limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Development on private or State lands requiring funding or&nbsp;
authorization from other Federal agencies, such as the Department of&nbsp;
Housing and Urban Development;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Military training or similar activities of the U.S. Department&nbsp;
of Defense (Army, Navy, and National Guard) on State-owned lands (e.g.,&nbsp;
Kanaio Training Area);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Construction of communication sites licensed by the Federal&nbsp;
Communications Commission;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Road construction and maintenance, right-of-way designation,&nbsp;
and regulation of agricultural activities by Federal agencies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Hazard mitigation and post-disaster repairs funded by the&nbsp;
Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Activities not previously mentioned that are funded or&nbsp;
authorized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Forest Service,&nbsp;
Natural Resources Conservation Service), Department of Defense,&nbsp;
Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Department of the&nbsp;
Interior (U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service), Department of&nbsp;
Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration),&nbsp;
Environmental Protection Agency, or any other Federal agency.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon publication of this proposed rule, Federal agencies would also&nbsp;
be required to confer with the Service on effects to critical habitat&nbsp;
if such actions may destroy or adversely modify proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat. Upon publication of a final rule designating critical habitat,&nbsp;
Federal agencies would need to include consideration of effects to&nbsp;
critical habitat in consultations on these actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have questions regarding whether specific activities would&nbsp;
constitute adverse modification of critical habitat, contact the Field&nbsp;
Supervisor, Pacific Islands Ecological Services Field Office (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of the regulations on listed&nbsp;
wildlife and plants and inquiries about prohibitions and permits should&nbsp;
be directed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act Section 10 Program at the same address.

Economic Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires that we designate critical&nbsp;
habitat on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information&nbsp;
available, and that we consider the economic and other relevant impacts&nbsp;
of designating a particular area as critical habitat. We may exclude&nbsp;
areas from critical habitat designation if the benefits of exclusion&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of designation, provided the exclusion will not&nbsp;
result in the extinction of the species. We will conduct an analysis of&nbsp;
the economic impacts of designating these areas as critical habitat&nbsp;
prior to making a final determination. When completed, we will announce&nbsp;
the availability of the draft economic analysis with a notice in the&nbsp;
Federal Register.

Public Comments Solicited

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We intend that any final action resulting from this proposal be as&nbsp;
accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, we solicit comments&nbsp;
or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,&nbsp;
the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party&nbsp;
concerning this proposed rule. We are particularly interested in&nbsp;
comments concerning:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The reasons why any proposed area should or should not be&nbsp;
determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act&nbsp;
and 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1), including whether the benefits of designation&nbsp;
will outweigh any threats to the species due to designation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Any areas on the islands of Maui, Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Molokai,&nbsp;
or the other main Hawaiian Islands not included in this proposed&nbsp;
designation that may be considered essential to the species'&nbsp;
conservation and recovery and should be included in the final&nbsp;
designation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Specific information on the number and distribution of the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth and what habitat is essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of this species and why;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Whether lands within proposed critical habitat are currently&nbsp;
being managed to address conservation needs of the Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Land use practices and current or planned activities in the&nbsp;
subject areas and their possible impacts on proposed critical habitat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Military training or similar activities of the U.S. Department&nbsp;
of Defense (Army, Navy, and National Guard) on State-owned lands (e.g.,&nbsp;
Kanaio Training Area);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Any foreseeable economic or other impacts resulting from the&nbsp;
proposed designation of critical habitat, in particular, any impacts on&nbsp;
small entities or families;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Whether future development and approval of conservation&nbsp;
measures (e.g., Conservation Agreements, Safe Harbor Agreements, etc.)&nbsp;
should be excluded from critical habitat and, if so, by what mechanism;&nbsp;
and,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) Economic and other values associated with designating critical&nbsp;
habitat for the Blackburn's sphinx moth, such as those derived from&nbsp;
non-consumptive uses (e.g., hiking, camping, eco-tourism, enhanced&nbsp;
watershed

[[Page 40648]]

protection, improved air quality, increased soil retention, ``existence&nbsp;
values,'' and reductions in administrative costs).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we receive information that any of the areas proposed as&nbsp;
critical habitat are currently being managed to address the&nbsp;
conservation needs of the Blackburn's sphinx moth and provide adequate&nbsp;
management and protection, we would remove such areas from the final&nbsp;
rule because they would not meet the definition of critical habitat in&nbsp;
section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act. If you wish to comment, you may submit&nbsp;
your comments and materials concerning this proposal by either of the&nbsp;
following methods:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. You may submit written comments and information to Paul Henson,&nbsp;
Field Supervisor, Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, U.S. Fish&nbsp;
and Wildlife Service, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 3-122, Box 50088,&nbsp;
Honolulu, HI 96850.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. You may hand-deliver written comments to our Pacific Islands&nbsp;
Fish and Wildlife Office, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 3-122,&nbsp;
Honolulu, Hawaii.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our practice is to make comments, including names and home&nbsp;
addresses of respondents, available for public review during regular&nbsp;
business hours. Respondents may request that we withhold their home&nbsp;
address, which we will honor to the extent allowable by law. There also&nbsp;
may be circumstances in which we would withhold a respondent's&nbsp;
identity, as allowable by law. If you wish us to withhold your name or&nbsp;
address, you must state this request prominently at the beginning of&nbsp;
your comment. To the extent consistent with applicable law, we will&nbsp;
make all submissions from organizations or businesses, and from&nbsp;
individuals identifying themselves as representatives or officials of&nbsp;
organizations or businesses, available for public inspection in their&nbsp;
entirety. Comments and materials received will be available for public&nbsp;
inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Pacific&nbsp;
Islands Fish and Wildlife Office in Honolulu.

Peer Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with our policy published on July 1, 1994 (59 FR&nbsp;
34270), we will seek the expert opinions of at least three appropriate&nbsp;
and independent specialists regarding this proposed rule. The purpose&nbsp;
of such review is to ensure listing and critical habitat decisions are&nbsp;
based on scientifically sound data, assumptions, and analyses. We will&nbsp;
send copies of this proposed rule to these peer reviewers immediately&nbsp;
following publication in the Federal Register. We will invite the peer&nbsp;
reviewers to comment, during the public comment period, on the specific&nbsp;
assumptions and conclusions regarding the proposed designations of&nbsp;
critical habitat. We will consider all comments and data received&nbsp;
during the 60-day comment period on this proposed rule during&nbsp;
preparation of a final rule-making. Accordingly, the final decision may&nbsp;
differ from this proposal.

Clarity of the Rule

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations and&nbsp;
notices that are easy to understand. We invite your comments on how to&nbsp;
make this proposed rule easier to understand, including answers to&nbsp;
questions such as the following--(1) Are the requirements in the&nbsp;
proposed rule clearly stated? (2) Does the proposed rule contain&nbsp;
technical jargon that interferes with the clarity? (3) Does the format&nbsp;
of the proposed rule (grouping and order of the sections, use of&nbsp;
headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce its clarity? (4) Is the&nbsp;
description of the notice in the ``Supplementary Information'' section&nbsp;
of the preamble helpful in understanding the notice? What else could we&nbsp;
do to make this proposed rule easier to understand?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send a copy of any comments that concern how we could make this&nbsp;
rule easier to understand to the Office of Regulatory Affairs,&nbsp;
Department of the Interior, Room 7229, 1849 C Street NW., Washington,&nbsp;
DC 20240. You also may e-mail comments to: <a href="mailto:Exsec@ios.doi.gov">Exsec@ios.doi.gov</a>.

Required Determinations

Regulatory Planning and Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, this document is a&nbsp;
significant rule and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and&nbsp;
Budget (OMB) in accordance with the four criteria discussed below. We&nbsp;
are preparing a draft economic analysis of this proposed action, which&nbsp;
will be available for public comment, to determine the economic&nbsp;
consequences of designating the specific areas as critical habitat. The&nbsp;
availability of the draft economic analysis will be announced in the&nbsp;
Federal Register so that it is available for public review and comment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) While we will prepare an economic analysis to assist us in&nbsp;
considering whether areas would be excluded from critical habitat&nbsp;
designation pursuant to section 4 of the Act, we do not believe this&nbsp;
rule will have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more&nbsp;
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the&nbsp;
economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,&nbsp;
or State, local or tribal communities. Therefore, we do not believe a&nbsp;
cost benefit and economic analysis pursuant to E.O. 12866 is required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Act, critical habitat may not be adversely modified by a&nbsp;
Federal agency action; critical habitat does not impose any&nbsp;
restrictions on non-Federal persons unless they are conducting&nbsp;
activities funded or otherwise sponsored or permitted by a Federal&nbsp;
agency. Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that&nbsp;
they do not jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Section&nbsp;
7 also requires Federal agencies to consult with us if a proposed&nbsp;
action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat. Based on&nbsp;
our experience with the species and its needs, we believe that any&nbsp;
Federal action or authorized action that could potentially cause an&nbsp;
adverse modification of the proposed critical habitat would currently&nbsp;
be considered as jeopardy to the species under the Act in areas&nbsp;
occupied by the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, we do not expect the designation of areas as critical&nbsp;
habitat within the geographical range of the species to have any&nbsp;
incremental impacts on what actions may or may not be conducted by&nbsp;
Federal agencies or non-Federal persons that receive Federal&nbsp;
authorization or funding. The designation of areas as critical habitat&nbsp;
where section 7 consultations would not have occurred but for the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation may have impacts on what actions may or&nbsp;
may not be conducted by Federal agencies or non-Federal persons who&nbsp;
receive Federal authorization or funding that are not attributable to&nbsp;
the species listing. We will evaluate any impact through our economic&nbsp;
analysis (required under section 4 of the Act: see the ``Exclusions&nbsp;
Under Section 4(b)(2)'' section of this rule). Non-Federal persons who&nbsp;
do not have a Federal sponsorship of their actions are not restricted&nbsp;
by the designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) We do not believe this rule would create inconsistencies with&nbsp;
other agencies' actions. As discussed above, Federal agencies have been&nbsp;
required to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued&nbsp;
existence of the Blackburn's sphinx moth since its listing in February&nbsp;
2000 (65 FR 4770). We will evaluate any additional impact through our&nbsp;
economic analysis. Because of the potential for impacts on other&nbsp;
Federal agencies' activities, we will continue to review this proposed&nbsp;
action

[[Page 40649]]

for any inconsistencies with other Federal agencies' actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) We do not believe this rule, if made final, would materially&nbsp;
affect entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights&nbsp;
and obligations of their recipients. Federal agencies are currently&nbsp;
required to ensure that their activities do not jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of a listed species, and, as discussed above, we&nbsp;
will evaluate any additional impacts through an economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) OMB has determined that this rule raises novel legal or policy&nbsp;
issues and, as a result, this rule has undergone OMB review.

Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as&nbsp;
amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act (SBREFA) of&nbsp;
1996), whenever an agency is required to publish a notice of rulemaking&nbsp;
for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for&nbsp;
public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the&nbsp;
effects of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small&nbsp;
organizations, and small government jurisdictions). However, no&nbsp;
regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of the agency&nbsp;
certifies the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a&nbsp;
substantial number of small entities. SBREFA amended the Regulatory&nbsp;
Flexibility Act to require Federal agencies to provide a statement of&nbsp;
the factual basis for certifying that rule will not have a significant&nbsp;
economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. SBREFA also&nbsp;
amended the RFA to require a certification statement. In today's rule,&nbsp;
we are certifying that the rule will not have a significant effect on a&nbsp;
substantial number of small entities for the reasons described below.&nbsp;
However, should the economic analyses prepared pursuant to section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the ESA indicate otherwise, we will revisit this&nbsp;
determination at that time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small entities include small organizations, such as independent&nbsp;
non-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions,&nbsp;
including school boards and city and town governments that serve fewer&nbsp;
than 50,000 residents, as well as small businesses. Small businesses&nbsp;
include manufacturing and mining concerns with fewer than 500&nbsp;
employees, wholesale trade entities with fewer than 100 employees,&nbsp;
retail and service businesses with less than $5 million in annual&nbsp;
sales, general and heavy construction businesses with less than $27.5&nbsp;
million in annual business, special trade contractors doing less than&nbsp;
$11.5 million in annual business, and agricultural businesses with&nbsp;
annual sales less than $750,000. To determine if potential economic&nbsp;
impacts to these small entities are significant, we consider the types&nbsp;
of activities that might trigger regulatory impacts under this rule as&nbsp;
well as the types of project modifications that may result. In general,&nbsp;
the term significant economic impact is meant to apply to a typical&nbsp;
small business firm's business operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine if the rule would affect a substantial number of small&nbsp;
entities, we consider the number of small entities affected within&nbsp;
particular types of economic activities (e.g., housing development,&nbsp;
grazing, oil and gas production, timber harvesting, etc.). We apply the&nbsp;
``substantial number'' test individually to each industry to determine&nbsp;
if certification is appropriate. In some circumstances, especially with&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat designations of very limited extent, we may&nbsp;
aggregate across all industries and consider whether the total number&nbsp;
of small entities affected is substantial. In estimating the numbers of&nbsp;
small entities potentially affected, we also consider whether their&nbsp;
activities have any Federal involvement; some kinds of activities are&nbsp;
unlikely to have any Federal involvement and so will not be affected by&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designation of critical habitat only affects activities conducted,&nbsp;
funded, or permitted by Federal agencies; non-Federal activities are&nbsp;
not affected by the designation. In areas where the species is present,&nbsp;
Federal agencies are already required to consult with us under section&nbsp;
7 of the Act on activities that they fund, permit, or implement that&nbsp;
may affect the Blackburn's sphinx moth. If this critical habitat&nbsp;
designation is finalized, Federal agencies must also consult with us if&nbsp;
their activities may affect designated critical habitat. However, we do&nbsp;
not believe this will result in any additional regulatory burden on&nbsp;
Federal agencies or their applicants because consultation would already&nbsp;
be required due to the presence of the listed species, and the duty to&nbsp;
avoid adverse modification of critical habitat would not trigger&nbsp;
additional regulatory impacts beyond the duty to avoid jeopardizing the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the duty to avoid adverse modification does not trigger&nbsp;
additional regulatory impacts in areas where the species is present,&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat could result in an additional economic&nbsp;
burden on small entities due to the requirement to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation for ongoing Federal activities. However, Blackburn's&nbsp;
sphinx moth has only been listed since February 2000, and there have&nbsp;
been only five informal consultations involving the species. Therefore,&nbsp;
the requirement to reinitiate consultations for ongoing projects is not&nbsp;
anticipated to affect a substantial number of small entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the species is clearly not present, designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat could trigger additional review of Federal activities under&nbsp;
section 7 of the Act. Blackburn's sphinx moth has been listed only a&nbsp;
relatively short time and there have been no activities with Federal&nbsp;
involvement in these areas during this time. There is a history of only&nbsp;
five informal consultations based on the listing of this species to&nbsp;
date. Therefore, for the purposes of this review and certification&nbsp;
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we are assuming that any future&nbsp;
consultations in the areas proposed as critical habitat will be due to&nbsp;
the critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the proposed designation is partially on Federal lands. All&nbsp;
of the eight units are partially or entirely on lands owned and managed&nbsp;
by the State of Hawaii, which is not a small entity for purposes of&nbsp;
this analysis. This includes units within the Ahihi-Kinau NAR, Kanaio&nbsp;
NAR, Kanaha State Bird Sanctuary, or the Kahoolawe Island Reserve. All&nbsp;
of these land areas are primarily managed for conservation of natural&nbsp;
resources, including threatened and endangered species. On State lands,&nbsp;
activities with no Federal involvement would not be affected by the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six of the eight units of the proposed designation are partially on&nbsp;
privately-owned land. On private lands, activities that lack Federal&nbsp;
involvement would not be affected by the critical habitat designation.&nbsp;
Other than some agriculture and ranching, no activities of an economic&nbsp;
nature currently occur on the private lands in the area encompassed by&nbsp;
this proposed designation. Furthermore, many of these areas are within&nbsp;
a State Conservation District and have a very limited range of&nbsp;
allowable activities that could occur there under the State&nbsp;
Conservation District Use permitting program. Because of the&nbsp;
Conservation District zoning, and because many of the sites are so&nbsp;
remote and inaccessible that off-road vehicular transport or hiking is&nbsp;
normally required for access, new commercial or additional agricultural&nbsp;
development is unlikely even at a small scale. Therefore, Federal&nbsp;
agencies such as the Economic Development Administration, which is&nbsp;
occasionally

[[Page 40650]]

involved in funding municipal projects, are unlikely to be involved in&nbsp;
projects in these areas. Informal consultation under section 7 of the&nbsp;
Act between us and another Federal agency has occurred a total of five&nbsp;
times, specifically on the island of Kahoolawe and entirely involved&nbsp;
the Department of the Navy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, two different mechanisms in section 7 consultations&nbsp;
could lead to additional regulatory requirements. First, if we conclude&nbsp;
in a biological opinion, that a proposed action is likely to jeopardize&nbsp;
the continued existence of a species or adversely modify its critical&nbsp;
habitat, we can offer ``reasonable and prudent alternatives.''&nbsp;
Reasonable and prudent alternatives are alternative actions that can be&nbsp;
implemented in a manner consistent with the scope of the Federal&nbsp;
agency's legal authority and jurisdiction, that are economically and&nbsp;
technologically feasible, and that would avoid jeopardizing the&nbsp;
continued existence of listed species or resulting in adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat. A Federal agency and an applicant may&nbsp;
elect to implement a reasonable and prudent alternative associated with&nbsp;
a biological opinion that has found jeopardy or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat. An agency or applicant could alternatively choose to&nbsp;
seek an exemption from the requirements of the Act or proceed without&nbsp;
implementing the reasonable and prudent alternative. However, unless an&nbsp;
exemption were obtained, the Federal agency would be at risk of&nbsp;
violating section 7(a)(2) of the Act if it chose to proceed without&nbsp;
implementing the reasonable and prudent alternatives. Secondly, if we&nbsp;
find that a proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued&nbsp;
existence of a listed animal species, we may identify reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent measures designed to minimize the amount or extent of take and&nbsp;
require the Federal agency or applicant to implement such measures&nbsp;
through non-discretionary terms and conditions. However, the Act does&nbsp;
not prohibit the take of listed plant species or require terms and&nbsp;
conditions to minimize adverse effect to critical habitat. We may also&nbsp;
identify discretionary conservation recommendations designed to&nbsp;
minimize or avoid the adverse effects of a proposed action on listed&nbsp;
species or critical habitat, help implement recovery plans, or to&nbsp;
develop information that could contribute to the recovery of the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on our experience with section 7 consultations for all listed&nbsp;
species, virtually all projects-including those that, in their initial&nbsp;
proposed form, would result in jeopardy or adverse modification&nbsp;
determinations in section 7 consultations-can be implemented&nbsp;
successfully with, at most, the adoption of reasonable and prudent&nbsp;
alternatives. These measures, by definition, must be economically&nbsp;
feasible and within the scope of authority of the Federal agency&nbsp;
involved in the consultation. As we have only a minimal consultation&nbsp;
history for Blackburn's sphinx moth, we can only describe the general&nbsp;
kinds of actions that may be identified in future reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent alternatives. These are based on our understanding of the needs&nbsp;
of the species and the threats it faces, especially as described in the&nbsp;
final listing rule and in this proposed critical habitat designation,&nbsp;
as well as our experience with native Hawaiian arthropods in Hawaii.&nbsp;
The kinds of actions that may be included in future reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent alternatives include conservation set-asides, management of&nbsp;
competing non-native species and predators, restoration of degraded&nbsp;
habitat, construction of protective fencing, and regular monitoring.&nbsp;
These measures are not likely to result in a significant economic&nbsp;
impact to project proponents. As required under section 4(b)(2) of the&nbsp;
Act, we will conduct an analysis of the potential economic impacts of&nbsp;
this proposed critical habitat designation, and will make that analysis&nbsp;
available for public review and comment before finalizing this&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, we have considered whether this proposed rule would&nbsp;
result in a significant economic effect on a substantial number of&nbsp;
small entities. It would not affect a substantial number of small&nbsp;
entities. The entire designation involves eight sites partially or&nbsp;
entirely on State lands, one site partially on Federal land, and six&nbsp;
sites partially on privately owned lands, all of which are located in&nbsp;
areas where likely future land uses are not expected to result in&nbsp;
Federal involvement or section 7 consultations. As discussed earlier,&nbsp;
many of the private lands are within a State Agricultural District&nbsp;
where few commercial activities are undertaken, or within a State&nbsp;
Conservation District where no commercial activities are undertaken at&nbsp;
those locations and, therefore, are not likely to require any Federal&nbsp;
authorization. In these areas, Federal involvement--and thus section 7&nbsp;
consultations, the only trigger for economic impact under this rule--
would be limited to a small subset of the area proposed. The most&nbsp;
likely Federal involvement would be through a habitat restoration or&nbsp;
conservation activity for this species or another federally listed&nbsp;
endangered or threatened species. Because of the rugged terrain and&nbsp;
extreme remoteness of most of the proposed designation areas, we&nbsp;
anticipate that projects involving Federal agencies will be infrequent.&nbsp;
This rule would result in project modifications only when proposed&nbsp;
Federal activities would destroy or adversely modify critical habitat.&nbsp;
While this may occur, it is not expected frequently enough to affect a&nbsp;
substantial number of small entities. Even when it does occur, we do&nbsp;
not expect it to result in a significant economic impact, as the&nbsp;
measures included in reasonable and prudent alternatives must be&nbsp;
economically feasible and consistent with the proposed action. We are&nbsp;
certifying that the proposed designation of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth will not have a significant economic impact on&nbsp;
a substantial number of small entities, and an initial regulatory&nbsp;
flexibility analysis is not required. However, should the economic&nbsp;
analyses of this proposed rule indicate that there may be significant&nbsp;
economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities, we will&nbsp;
revisit this determination.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501&nbsp;
August 25, 2000 et seq.):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) We believe this rule will not ``significantly or uniquely''&nbsp;
affect small governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not&nbsp;
required. Small governments will be affected only to the extent that&nbsp;
any programs having Federal funds, permits, or other authorized&nbsp;
activities must ensure that their actions will not adversely affect the&nbsp;
critical habitat. However, as discussed above, these actions are&nbsp;
currently subject to equivalent restrictions through the listing&nbsp;
protections of the species, and no further restrictions are anticipated&nbsp;
to result from critical habitat designation of occupied areas. In our&nbsp;
economic analysis, we will evaluate any impact of designating areas&nbsp;
where section 7 consultations would not have occurred but for the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) This rule will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or&nbsp;
greater in any year; that is, it is not a ``significant regulatory&nbsp;
action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat imposes no obligations on State or local governments.

Takings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12630 (``Government Actions and&nbsp;
Interference with Constitutionally

[[Page 40651]]

Protected Private Property Rights''), we have analyzed the potential&nbsp;
takings implications of designating critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth in a preliminary takings implication&nbsp;
assessment. The takings implications assessment concludes that this&nbsp;
proposed rule does not pose significant takings implications. Once the&nbsp;
revised economic analysis is completed for this proposed rule, we will&nbsp;
review and revise this preliminary assessment as warranted.

Executive Order 13211

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.&nbsp;
13211) on regulations that significantly affect energy supply,&nbsp;
distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to&nbsp;
prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions.&nbsp;
Although this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive&nbsp;
Order 12866, it is not expected to significantly affect energy&nbsp;
supplies, distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a&nbsp;
significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is&nbsp;
required.

Federalism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 13132, the rule does not have&nbsp;
significant Federalism effects. A Federalism assessment is not&nbsp;
required. As discussed above, the designation of critical habitat in&nbsp;
areas currently occupied by the Blackburn's sphinx moth would have&nbsp;
little incremental impact on State and local governments and their&nbsp;
activities. The designations may have some benefit to these governments&nbsp;
in that the areas essential to the conservation of these species are&nbsp;
more clearly defined, and the primary constituent elements of the&nbsp;
habitat necessary to the survival of the species are identified. While&nbsp;
this definition and identification does not alter where and what&nbsp;
federally sponsored activities may occur, it may assist these local&nbsp;
governments in long-range planning rather than waiting for case-by-case&nbsp;
section 7 consultation to occur.

Civil Justice Reform

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12988, the Department of the&nbsp;
Interior's Office of the Solicitor has determined that this rule does&nbsp;
not unduly burden the judicial system and does meet the requirements of&nbsp;
sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. We designate critical habitat&nbsp;
in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Office of the&nbsp;
Solicitor will review the final determination for this proposal. We&nbsp;
will make every effort to ensure that the final determination contains&nbsp;
no drafting errors, provides clear standards, simplifies procedures,&nbsp;
reduces burdens, and is clearly written, such that the risk of&nbsp;
litigation is minimized. The proposed rule uses standard property&nbsp;
descriptions and identifies the primary constituent elements within the&nbsp;
designated areas to assist the public in understanding the habitat&nbsp;
needs of Blackburn's sphinx moth.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule does not contain any new collections of information that&nbsp;
require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the&nbsp;
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule will not&nbsp;
impose new record-keeping or reporting requirements on State or local&nbsp;
governments, individuals, businesses, or organizations. An agency may&nbsp;
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a&nbsp;
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB&nbsp;
Control Number.

National Environmental Policy Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that an Environmental Assessment or an&nbsp;
Environmental Impact Statement as defined by the National Environmental&nbsp;
Policy Act of 1969 need not be prepared in connection with regulations&nbsp;
adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act as&nbsp;
amended. A notice outlining our reason for this determination was&nbsp;
published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).&nbsp;
This proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action&nbsp;
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994,&nbsp;
``Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments'' (59 FR 22951), E.O. 13175, and the Department of the&nbsp;
Interior's manual at 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our&nbsp;
responsibility to communicate meaningfully with federally recognized&nbsp;
Tribes on a government-to-government basis. The proposed designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat for Blackburn's sphinx moth does not contain any&nbsp;
Tribal lands or lands that we have identified as impacting Tribal trust&nbsp;
resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Amend Sec. 17.95(i) by adding critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Blackburn's sphinx moth (Manduca blackburni) in the same alphabetical&nbsp;
order as this species occurs in Sec. 17.11(h), to read as follows:


Sec. 17.95&nbsp; Critical habitat--fish and wildlife.

* * * * *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Insects.
* * * * *
Blackburn's Sphinx Moth (Manduca blackburni)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the islands of Maui,&nbsp;
Kahoolawe, Hawaii, and Molokai on the maps below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Found within these areas are the primary constituent elements&nbsp;
of critical habitat for Blackburn's sphinx moth that includes specific&nbsp;
habitat components identified as essential for the primary biological&nbsp;
needs of foraging, sheltering, maturation, dispersal, breeding, and egg&nbsp;
laying. The primary constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx&nbsp;
moth larvae for foraging and maturation are the two identified larval&nbsp;
host plant species within the endemic Nothocestrum genus (Nothocestrum&nbsp;
breviflorum and Nothocestrum latifolium) and the dry and mesic habitats&nbsp;
between the elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) and&nbsp;
receiving between 25 and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation&nbsp;
that currently support or historically have supported these plants. The&nbsp;
primary constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth adults&nbsp;
for foraging, sheltering, dispersal, breeding, and egg production are&nbsp;
native, nectar-supplying plants, including but not limited to Ipomoea&nbsp;
spp., Capparis sandwichiana, and Plumbago zeylanica and the dry and&nbsp;
mesic habitats between the elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000&nbsp;
ft) and receiving between 25 and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual&nbsp;
precipitation that currently support or historically have supported&nbsp;
these plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing man-made features&nbsp;
and structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as&nbsp;
houses, offices, warehouses, stores, or any other buildings, roads,&nbsp;
aqueducts, antennas, towers, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved&nbsp;
areas, residential lawns, gardens, parking lots, cemeteries, and any&nbsp;
other urban landscaped areas or man-made structures.
