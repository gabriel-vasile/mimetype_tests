           INCARCERATE SOMEONE IN ILLINOIS PRISONS. SO WE'RE SPENDING IN

           INDUSTRY ENTERED INTO A TREATY WITH LITHUANIA IN WHICH RUSSIA
           EXPLICITLY ADMITTED THAT THE 1940 SOVIET ANNEXATION VIOLATED
           LITHUANIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND THAT LITHUANIA, THEY SAID AT THE
           TIME, WAS FREE TO PURSUE ITS OWN SECURITY AGREEMENTS AND
           ARRANGEMENTS. SO IN 1991 -- IN THOSE ENLIGHTENED MOMENTS AS THE
           SOVIET EMPIRE CAME DOWN AND RUSSIA BECAME A NEW STATE WITH
           DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS -- THEY ENTERED INTO A TREATY WITH

           IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH IS OF CONTINUING CONCERN ACROSS AMERICA,
