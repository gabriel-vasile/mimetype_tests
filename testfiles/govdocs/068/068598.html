    <P><B>Sept. 25, 1998</B>: Astronomers have found evidence for
    the most powerful magnetic field ever seen in the universe. They
    found it by observing a long-sought, short-lived &quot;afterglow&quot;
    of subatomic particles ejected from a magnetar -- a neutron star
    with a magnetic field billions of times stronger than any on
    Earth and 100 times stronger than any other previously known
    in the Universe. The afterglow is believed to be the aftermath
    of a massive starquake on the neutron star's surface.</P>

    <P>&quot;Where there's smoke, there's fire, and we've seen the
    'smoke' that tells us there's a magnetar out there,&quot; says
    Dale Frail, who used the National Science Foundation's (NSF)
    Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope to make the discovery.</P>

    <P>&quot;Nature has created a unique laboratory where there are
    magnetic fields far stronger than anything that can be created
    here on Earth. As a result, the study of these objects enables
    us to study the effects of extraordinarily intense magnetic fields
    on matter,&quot; explains Dr. Morris L. Aizenmann, executive
    officer in the Division of Astronomy.</P>

    <P>Frail, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
    (NRAO) in Socorro, New Mexico, along with Shri Kulkarni and Josh
    Bloom, astronomers at Caltech, discovered radio emission coming
    from a strange object 15,000 light-years away in our own Milky
    Way Galaxy. The radio emission was seen after the object experienced
    an outburst of gamma-rays and X-rays in late August.</P>

    <P>&quot;This emission comes from particles ejected at nearly
    the speed of light from the surface of the neutron star interacting
    with the extremely powerful magnetic field,&quot; said Kulkarni.
    This is the first time this phenomenon, predicted by theorists,
    has been seen so clearly from a suspected magnetar.</P>

    <P>&quot;Magnetars are expected to behave in certain ways. Astronomers
    have seen one type of their predicted activity previously, and
    now we've seen a completely different piece of evidence that
    says this is, in fact, a magnetar. That's exciting.&quot; Kulkarni
    said. The new discovery, the scientists say, will allow them
    to decipher further details about magnetars and their outbursts.</P>

    <P>Magnetars were proposed in 1992 as a theoretical explanation
    for objects that repeatedly emit bursts of gamma-rays. These
    objects, called &quot;soft gamma-ray repeaters,&quot; or SGRs,
    were identified in 1986. There still are only four of these known.
    They are believed to be rotating, superdense neutron stars, like
    pulsars, but with much stronger magnetic fields.</P>

    <P>Neutron stars are the remains of massive stars that explode
    as a supernova at the end of their normal lifetime. They are
    so dense that a thimbleful of neutron-star material would weigh
    100 million tons.</P>

    <P>An ordinary pulsar emits &quot;lighthouse beams&quot; of radio
    waves that rotate with the star. When the star is oriented so
    that these beams sweep across the Earth, radio telescopes detect
    regularly-timed pulses.</P>

    <P>A magnetar is a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic
    field, strong enough to rip atoms apart. In the units used by
    physicists, the strength of a magnetar's magnetic field is about
    a million trillion Gauss; a refrigerator magnet has a field of
    about 100 Gauss.</P>

    <P>This superstrong magnetic field produces effects that distinguish
    magnetars from other neutron stars. First, the magnetic field
    is thought to act as a brake, slowing the star's rotation. The
    earlier discovery of pulsations several seconds apart in three
    SGRs indicated rotation rates slowed just as predicted by magnetar
    theory.</P>

    <P>Next, the magnetic field is predicted to cause &quot;starquakes&quot;
    in which the solid crust of the neutron star is cracked, releasing
    energy. That energy is released in two forms -- a burst of gamma-rays
    and X-rays and an ejection of subatomic particles at nearly the
    speed of light. The gamma-ray and X-ray burst lasts no more than
    a few minutes, while the ejected particles, interacting with
    the star's magnetic field, can produce detectable amounts of
    radio emission for several days.</P>

    <P>On August 27, the SGR called 1900+14 underwent a tremendous
    burst, the likes of which had not been seen since 1979. &quot;For
    a number of years now, I've been routinely looking toward the
    region of sky where we thought this thing might be,&quot; said
    Frail, &quot;hoping the magnetar would show itself.&quot; It
    did not disappoint; on September 3, the VLA found a new source
    of radio emission where one had not previously existed. The source
    quickly faded from view one week later.</P>

    <P>The immediate importance of this finding is that it provides
    a new and independent confirmation of the magnetar model. These
    impulsive particle &quot;winds,&quot; predicted by theory, carry
    as much energy as the flashes of hard X-ray emission and are
    important in slowing down the spinning magnetar.</P>

        <P>This discovery also allows astronomers to pinpoint the exact
        location of the SGR to allow further study of the magnetar with
        other powerful telescopes.</P>

        <P>&quot;Trying to find this source of gamma-rays was like nighttime
        sailing with a broken lighthouse; now, we're no longer in the
        dark, and can study the magnetar for years to come,&quot; said
        Bloom. In time, the free-flowing particle wind can inflate a
        nebula called a plerion.</TD>
