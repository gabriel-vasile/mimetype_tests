<h1>FIRST PHASE OF LUNAR EXPLORATION COMPLETED:</h1>

<p>
<h2>The First Lunar Science Conference</h2>

<p>

The decade of Apollo ended with investigators of the lunar samples
preparing to present their first findings to the scientific world. On
January 5, 1970, several hundred scientists, including all 142 principal
investigators for the Apollo 11 samples, met in Houston for the first of
many annual Lunar Science Conferences. For four days they discussed the
chemistry, mineralogy, and petrology of the lunar samples, described the
search for carbon compounds and evidence of living material, the results
of age determinations, and what had been learned from the data returned
from the surface instruments.

<p>
The flood of information presented at the conference precluded any large
generalizations. Some of the rocks brought back by Apollo 11 were
basalts, formed by melting, but the samples contained a high percentage
of breccias. Most of the rock fragments were similar to the larger
rocks; a small number, however, were entirely unlike the rest and may
have come from the nearby lunar highlands. The properties of most of the
material were consistent with formation at high temperature in the
absence of oxygen or water. More than 20 minerals known on earth had
been identified, suggesting a similarity of origin for the two planets,
but at least three new ones unique to the moon had been discovered. The
ages of the lunar rocks and soil seemed to differ: the basalts from
Tranquility Base were found to be between 3 and 4 billion years old,
while the soil contained particles believed to have been formed 4.6
billion years ago.<a href = "#source51"><b>51</b></a> In light of the
recently determined age of the Apollo 12 samples, which were roughly a
billion years younger, these numbers indicated that more than one
cataclysmic event had shaped the lunar surface.

<p>
Other studies showed that some lunar material dug up from below the
surface had once been on the surface, indicating that the lunar soil was
undergoing constant &quot;gardening.&quot; Studies of isotopes produced
by cosmic-ray bombardment indicated that some lunar rocks had been on or
just below the surface for at least 10 million years.<a href =

<p>
The search for carbon compounds - possible relics of life forms in the
moon rocks - was inconclusive, in part because the methods of detection
were extremely sensitive. Carbon and some carbon compounds were
detected, but no molecules that could clearly be identified as derived
from living organisms. The intensive search for living organisms
conducted in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory was negative, as were
efforts to identify fossil microorganisms.<a href =

<p>
On the whole the early work on the Apollo 11 samples was more intriguing
than revealing. A few scientists were willing, on the basis of the
results presented at the Houston conference, to discard one or more
theories of lunar origin, but most were not. One commented, &quot;some
still like the moon hot; some like it cold.&quot; Many called attention
to the limitations of the data and the futility of drawing sweeping
conclusions with information from such a small area. One of them put it
in perspective with the comment, &quot;what I looked at was an area
equal to the size of three postage stamps and a thimbleful of
material&quot;; another remarked facetiously, &quot;our results are
based on the wanton destruction of two grams [about the weight of a
dime] of lunar material.&quot;<a href = "#source54"><b>54</b></a>

<p>
After four days of discussion, a panel of prominent scientists attempted
a summary at a news conference. Robert Jastrow, director of NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that &quot;old descriptions in
terms of a hot or cold moon are an oversimplification.&quot; To Edward
Anders of the University of Chicago it was clear that the moon &quot;has
been a geologically active body with several episodes of melting and
lava flows.&quot; For the last two or three billion years, however, it
has been almost dead. Jastrow and others doubted that the moon was
thrown off from the earth or that it was formed elsewhere and captured
later. Gene Simmons, newly appointed chief scientist at MSC, summed up
the state of lunar science at the end of the conference. &quot;There is
a large amount of undigested data and very little interpretation,&quot;
he said. &quot;You'll see in the next six months many revisions of
statements as to what it all means.&quot;<a href =
"#source55"><b>55</b></a>

<p>
The Lunar Sample Analysis Planning Team best characterized the
significance of the Tranquility samples:

<cite><blockquote>The Apollo 11 samples were collected from a very tiny
fraction of the moon's surface. Nevertheless, they have given a vast new
insight into the processes that have shaped this surface and have
established some significant limits on the rates and mechanisms by which
it evolved. The results reported do not resolve the problem of the
origin of the moon. However, the number of constraints that must be met
by any theory have been greatly increased. For example, if the moon
formed from the earth, it can now be stated with some confidence that
this separation took place prior to 4.3 x 10E9 [4.3 billion] years ago.
Furthermore, such a hypothesis must now take account of certain definite
differences in chemical composition [between the moon and the earth]. .
. . There is clear evidence . . . that the surface of the moon is
variable in both composition and age. <b>It is therefore of great
scientific importance to obtain materials from a variety of terrains and
sites</b> [emphasis added].<a href =
"#source56"><b>56</a></b></blockquote></cite>

After the conference ended on January 8 the scientists returned to their
labs to continue probing the lunar samples, while NASA focused on
sampling the variety of terrains and sites they deemed so important. The
next mission, Apollo 13, was already targeted for the Fra Mauro
Formation,<a href = "#source57"><b>57</b></a> a geologic unit that
covered large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium. The
landing site was just north of the crater Fra Mauro, about 180
kilometers (112 miles) due east of the spot where Pete Conrad had landed
<cite>Intrepid</cite>.
