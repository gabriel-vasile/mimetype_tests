          <p>There is a powerful inclination for many Americans of a certain
            age, myself included, to believe that the Great Depression somehow
            existed in monochrome. The thought flies in the face of reason, but
            it isn't hard to understand why it persists. So much black-and-white
            photography, particularly documentary photography, comes out of the
            1930s and the prewar forties, an era that's just ahead, incidentally,
            by about a decade and a half, of when I swam to consciousness (in
            the fifties, in the middle of the middle of the country, Kankakee,
            Illinois, &quot;so successfully disguised to myself&quot;—as the writer James
            Agee once said—&quot;as a child&quot;). Those old gelatin-silver prints, made
            by a corps of sublimely gifted government photographers working for
            the New Deal, have become part of our national identity. It's as
            if they're stored, burned there, behind our collective retina. We
            see them and understand about them even when we don't see them or
            know very many specifics about them at all—Walker Evans's sharecroppers
            in Hale County, Alabama. Dorothea Lange's &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; in Nipomo,
            California. Russell Lee's square dancers in Pie Town, New Mexico.
            Marion Post Wolcott's domino players tilted on their wicker-back
            chairs in the afternoon shade and drowse of a Mississippi drugstore.
            These pictures amount to a kind of Movietone reel looping through
            our heads. So much of what we seem to value about ourselves as a
            nation—pluck, perseverance, individuality, self-reliance, agrarian
            roots—is encoded in these photographs. To know and love them—and
            there are about 160,000 [sic] such images archived in the collections
            of the Library of Congress—it isn't necessary to know, or even have
            heard of, the names Walker Evans or Dorothea Lange or Russell Lee
            or Marion Post Wolcott . (There were about a dozen photographers,
            altogether, who worked at various times during the eight-year life
            of the project.) Much less would it be necessary to understand all
            about the alphabet-soup federal agencies—the RA [Resettlement Administration],
            the FSA, the OWI—which authorized and sponsored the picture-taking
          in the first place.</p>
          <p><img src="images/memory_2.jpg" alt="The Faro Caudill family eats dinner in their dugout  home in Pie Town, N.M., October 1940" width="486" height="263" border="0" class="reg" /></p>
<p class="caption">The Faro Caudill family eats dinner in their dugout home in

          <p> In brief: the idea, at least in the beginning, was this: to record
            through the medium of photography—which felt something like a new
            art in the thirties—the ravages of the Depression on America's rural
            population. Why? Not for its own sake, of course, but as a political
            means, a tool, for spurring Congress and the American public to support
            government relief and resettlement efforts, which were thought controversial:
            big brother's intervention on the little guy. But somehow along the
            way the documenting of hard times turned into something much wider
            and surprisingly artful. It turned into a pictorial encyclopedia
            of America herself—a portrait not just of rural life, where so much
            erosion of land and spirit had taken place, but a portrait of millions
            of Americans going about their day-to-day living—sometimes joyfully,
            sometimes desperately—in mill towns and mining towns and mountain
            towns and huge urban centers. What started narrow—Okie dust bowlers,
            shanty towns in West Virginia—spread wide, and almost surreptitiously
            on the part of the documentarians and the far-sighted Washington
            bureaucrat who had hired them for the project and directed their
            activities. His name was Roy Emerson Stryker, and he didn't love
            anything but this country, as one of his photographers once said
            of him. It was astonishing how much film, and of such wide variety,
            was being mailed to the Washington office for developing by Stryker's
            &quot;spies&quot; on the road. By the time America entered the war—really,
            a good while before that—there were tens of thousands of pictures.
            But by then the overriding aim of the work was to aid in any way
            possible to keep Hitler off our doorstep (as Stryker himself liked
            to say). And so the documenting of a nation had turned far more positive
            in tone and nature. Essentially the pictures were about America the
            beautiful, America the productive, America the determined, America
            the mobilizing. Here was Rosie the Riveter, bent to her task in her
            B-17 factory in Long Beach. Still, the pictures were by and large
          wonderful. They were so American.</p>

          <p>John Vachon—who was nearly as good a writer as he was a squinter
            through a box, and who started out as a messenger boy for the FSA
            in the Washington office—once tried to explain in print how the wider,
            surreptitious lens had come about from the project's original intent:
            &quot;Through some sublime extension of logic which has never been satisfactorily
            explained to anyone, Stryker believed that while documenting these
            mundane activities [government housing loans and federal farm co-ops],
            his photographers should, along the way, photograph whatever they
            saw, really saw: people, towns, road signs, railroad stations, barbershops,
            the weather, or the objects on top of a chest of drawers in Grundy
            County, Iowa.&quot; Ernest Hemingway, who was practicing a different kind
            of subversive American art in the thirties and forties, once said
            something similar about literature: &quot;All good books are alike in
            that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you
            are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to
            you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the
            ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how
            the weather was.&quot; Substitute the word &quot;photographs&quot; for &quot;books,&quot;
            and I think you have the basis of an explanation of the staying power
            of these pictures, of the strange way they have burrowed into our
          walking dreams.</p>

          <p>Was the work, right from the beginning, propagandistic? Of course
            it was, and sometimes in greater than lesser ways. Propaganda is
            a loaded word. So is another word: politics. As one historian of
            this period has written, the motive of the FSA photography project
            was always &quot;political in the best sense of that suspect word.&quot; In
            ways difficult to explain, the propagandizing was always there alongside
            the artfulness. The two co-joined and the one didn't seem to pollute
            the other, not most of the time. Later in this essay, I will return
            to the notion of propagandizing. But for now suffice it to say that
            the unlikely artistry that resulted from this tax-supported government
            relief project seems due in equal parts to the giftedness of the
            photographers themselves, to Roy Stryker's vision, and, not least,
            to the times themselves. Or, to put it another way, to what was always
          there, waiting, on the other side of the lens.</p>

          <p> I have known and loved these old black-and-white FSA and OWI rectangles
            for most of my adult life. As I have said in another place, these
            images of ordinary, enduring Americans—easily the largest and greatest
            documentary project of a people in the history of photography—have
            always seemed most meaningful to me in my own times of stress. Indeed,
            the pictures epitomize for me the truth of what the great latter-day
            Swiss-American photographer Robert Frank called &quot;the humanity of
            the moment.&quot; When I look at the struggle coming up out of these pictures,
            I feel somehow as if I'm combing through my own and the country's
            ancestral attic with Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck and maybe the
            Andrews Sisters and the Great Gildersleve, too, all of us lingering
            here and there to laugh but more often cry over every broken porcelain
            doorknob and rusting Dr Pepper sign. This was my own parents' time
            in America—two scared farm kids out of Kentucky and Ohio, who met
            and fell in love at a roller rink on the lip of a world war. (They
            were in a movie theater in a place called Xenia, nine weeks from
            their wedding, on that Sunday afternoon, December 7, 1941, when the
            lights went on and the manager delivered the news of what had happened
            out in Honolulu.) It must be at least a part of why the years between
            the Depression and World War II seem to exert such a deep, romantic
            pull on their child; of why the images, for all of their hardship
          in some cases, strike me as so oddly comforting.</p>
          <p>So I would have never guessed that I could fall head over heels,
            all over again, and in some ways even more deeply this time around,
            for FSA and OWI color work. Shoot, until recently, I barely knew
            such color documentary work existed—and, as it happens, I am the
            author of a book (published about a decade ago) about the life of
            Marion Post Wolcott, one of the greatest photographers, in my view,
            of that whole crew and era. What we have of FSA-OWI color work amounts,
            relatively speaking, to a thimbleful of pictures—only about 1,600
            images altogether. But let us be grateful for what is, for what survives,
            for what can be thought of, perhaps, as a new and complementary way
          of comprehending our national identity. </p>
