<p class="title2"><b>Ecstasy and Other Club Drugs

</b></p>


<p><span class="rtext">
The last two issues of <i>Pulse Check</i>
addressed "club drugs" as a special
topic because of reports that these
drugs were increasingly available and
that the number of users increased.
The continuing growth of the club
drug problem, particularly ecstasy, has
warranted the addition of a club
drugs section to the report.

<p>This broad category of drugs includes
the following:
<ul type="square">
<li> Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
or MDMA), a synthetic,
psychoactive substance with
stimulant and mild hallucinogenic
properties, is the most widely
available of club drugs and often
used in pill form.<br><br>
<li> Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is
a central nervous system depressant
usually sold as an odorless, colorless
liquid in water bottles. GHB
precursors, gamma butyrolactone
(GBL) (a chemical used in many
industrial cleaners) and 1,4 butanediol
(1,4 BD), convert into GHB in
the body and have been sold as
nutritional supplements in health
food stores and over the Internet,
often in powder or capsule form.
Because the effects of GHB precursors
are similar to those of GHB,
many <i>Pulse Check</i> sources do not
distinguish between GHB and its
precursors.<br><br>

<li> Ketamine is a prescription
anesthetic with hallucinogenic and
dissociative properties and marketed
for human use, but primarily for
veterinary use. Ketamine can be
used in liquid or powder form.<br><br>

<li>Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is a
benzodiazepine, no longer marketed in the United States but legally
prescribed in Mexico and other
countries. It has been involved in
numerous drug-assisted rapes, but
its most common abuse pattern is
episodic use by teenagers and
young adults as an "alcohol
extender" and disinhibitory agent.<br><br>

<li>Nitrous oxide is an inhalant often
referred to as laughing gas.<br><br>
<li> Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
("acid") is a hallucinogen, most
commonly distributed on blotter
paper and taken orally.</ul>


<p>The club or rave experience typically
involves music, dancing, and socializing
and usually lasts through the
night. Club drugs are commonly
combined with one another and with
other illicit drugs or alcohol. As
reported in the last <i>Pulse Check</i>,
treatment sources had less first-hand
knowledge of club drug activity than
the law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic sources, indicating that club drug users have not entered
treatment in large numbers. It is
important to note that the amount of
information received from <i>Pulse
Check</i> sources was much greater for
ecstasy than for other club drugs.

<p>
Although these drugs are categorized
as club drugs, the settings and contexts
of their use are expanding to include
venues other than nightclubs and
raves. Moreover, <i>Pulse Check</i> sources
continue to suggest that White non-Hispanics are no longer the exclusive
sellers and users of the drugs. An
increasing number of <i>Pulse Check</i>
sources report that ecstasy is being
sold with heroin and powder and
crack cocaine and that ecstasy users
are also using these other illicit drugs.
Just as <i>Pulse Check</i> continues to track
club drug activity due to concern
about increased availability and use,
Federal efforts to combat club
drugs (ecstasy in particular) include
enacting new Federal sentencing
guidelines for ecstasy (MDMA) and
ecstasy-like substances (including methylenedioxyamphetamine [MDA]
and paramethoxyamphetamine
PMA]). The new guidelines, effective
November 1, 2001, will increase the
prison term for the sale of 200 grams
of ecstasy (about 800 pills) from 15
months to 5 years, and the penalty
for sale of 8,000 pills will also rise
from 41 months to 120 months (similar
to that of powder cocaine). <i>Pulse
Check</i> will continue to track ecstasy
and club drug activity and, as new
laws are established, will report
changes, if any, in the sale and use of
club drugs.


<p><b>ECSTASY AND OTHER CLUB
DRUGS: THE PERCEPTION</b>

<p><b>How do <i>Pulse Check</i> sources
perceive the ecstasy problem in
their communities?</b> Ecstasy is not
considered the most widely abused
drug by any law enforcement, epidemiologic,
ethnographic, or treatment
source, but it is considered the
second most widely abused drug by
sources in four cities (Billings,
Honolulu, Memphis, and Miami), an
increase from only one source (the
Memphis law enforcement source)
during the last reporting period.
Additionally, the law enforcement
source in Billings is the only source to
report it as the drug contributing to
the second most serious consequences.
No other source reports ecstasy as
contributing to the most or second
most serious consequences in their
communities, and no other club drugs
were mentioned as such.

<p><b>What club drugs are emerging in
<i>Pulse Check</i> communities?</b>
<i>(<a href="#cluex1">Exhibit 1</a>)</i> Although not currently
considered the drug contributing to
the most serious consequences in any
city, ecstasy is reported as an emerging
drug of abuse by 25 <i>Pulse Check</i>
sources in most cities (15 of 21) across the Nation, with no regional
patterns evident. Other club drugs
mentioned as emerging include GHB
in Denver, Los Angeles, and Honolulu;
diverted ketamine in Denver;
and Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and
designer amphetamines distributed as
samples at raves in Los Angeles. In
only six cities (Billings, Birmingham,
Chicago, El Paso, New Orleans, and
Washington, DC) are club drugs not
reported as emerging this reporting
period. In four of those cities
(Chicago, El Paso, New Orleans, and
Washington, DC), club drugs were
reported as emerging last reporting
period, suggesting that these are now
established drugs of abuse in those
communities.

<p><b>ECSTASY AND OTHER CLUB
DRUGS: AVAILABILITY, SLANG,
AND COMBINATIONS</b>
<p>
<b>How available are club drugs in
<i>Pulse Check</i> communities?</b>
<i>(<a href="#cluex2">Exhibit 2</a>)</i> Nearly identical to reports
in the last <i>Pulse Check</i>, ecstasy remains the most available of club
drugs, with more than 90 percent (38
of 42) of law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic sources
reporting it as widely or somewhat
available. Only three sources deem
ecstasy as not very available: the
epidemiologic sources in Billings and
New Orleans and the law enforcement
source in El Paso. Availability of
club drugs is not based on regional
patterns.

<p>
As reported in the last <i>Pulse Check</i>,
GHB follows ecstasy as the most
available club drug, reported as widely
or somewhat available by 40 percent
(17 of 42) of respondents. GHB
is described as not available in only
three cities: Denver, El Paso, and
Portland (ME). As reported in the last
<i>Pulse Check</i>, cities where wide availability
is reported are predominantly
in the West or South: Billings,
Birmingham, Denver, Los Angeles,
Miami, New Orleans, and (in the
Northeast) New York.

<p>Diverted ketamine is considered
somewhat or widely available by 29
percent (12 of 42) of law enforcement,
epidemiologic, and ethnographic
sources, a lower percentage
than that reported in the last <i>Pulse
Check</i>. It is not available in three
western areas (Billings, Denver, and
Honolulu), El Paso, and Sioux Falls.
Rohypnol remains the least available
of the club drugs, with 19 percent of
law enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources reporting it as
somewhat or widely available. Three
(in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and
New York) report Rohypnol as widely
available, five report it as somewhat
available (in Boston, Detroit, El Paso
by both sources, and Seattle), and the
rest report it as not or not very available.
No regional patterns based on
ketamine or Rohypnol availability
are apparent.

GHB was not available or not very available according to a majority of pulse check respondents followed by somewhat available, widely available, and no response. Ketamine was not available or not very available according to a majority of respondents followed by an equal amount with no response or somewhat available and with less than 10% of respondents saying it was widely available. Rohypnol was not available or not very available according to a large majority of respondents followed by no response, somewhat available, and widely available." border="0"></div>

<a href="index.html#backcluex2"><div align="center"><p>Back to Exhibits</div></a>

<p><b>How has club drug availability
changed?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex3">Exhibit 3</a>)</i> According to
all law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic sources who discussed
this question (38 of 42), ecstasy availability increased or
remained stable between fall 2000
and spring 2001, with 64 percent (27
sources) reporting increases, and 29
percent reporting stable trends. As
with availability trends for other club
drugs, no regional patterns emerged.

<p>
GHB availability continues to show
mixed trends, according to 42 law
enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources: 24 percent
report increases (in Birmingham,
Billings, Chicago, Denver, Memphis,
New Orleans, Portland [ME], Sioux
Falls, and Washington, DC, according
to both sources), 12 percent report
declines (in Columbia [SC], Detroit,
Honolulu, Miami, and St. Louis), and
most report availability as stable.
Ketamine availability increased
according to sources in Chicago,
Columbia, New Orleans, New York,
Portland, and Washington, DC;
declined according to sources in
Honolulu and Miami; and remained
stable according to remaining
respondents. Rohypnol availability
shows mostly stable trends, with few exceptions: the law enforcement
sources in New Orleans and Portland
report increases, and declines are
reported in Birmingham, El Paso,
Honolulu, and Miami.

<p><b>How are club drugs and their
combinations referred to across
the country?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex4">Exhibit 4</a>)</i> Slang
terms for ecstasy are similar across
the Nation. It continues to be generally
referred to as "X," although "E"
and "roll" are also used. The practice
of taking ecstasy is often referred to
as "rolling." Ecstasy is often referred
to by its design or the shape of the
pill: for example, it is called "shamrock"
in St. Louis because pills may
be clover shaped and "Buddha" in
Memphis because pills may be
stamped with a Buddha design. Other
ecstasy terms vary by locality, and
many terms are new this reporting
period, suggesting increasing ecstasy
availability and use.
<p>
GHB continues to be referred to as
"G" and ketamine as "K" or "special
K." Rohypnol is typically referred to
as "roofies" and "rochas" where
available. Other terms for these drugs
vary by locality, with no particular
regional patterns. Use of particular
combinations of club drugs varies by
city and highlights that multisubstance
use or "cafeteria-style use"
remains common among club
drug users.

<p><b>ECSTASY: THE DRUG
</b><p><b>
What form does ecstasy come
in?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex5">Exhibit 5</a>)</i> According to law
enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources, the tablet form
of ecstasy remains, by far, the most
available, followed by powder and
liquid forms. Powder ecstasy is widely
available according to sources in
Boston, Memphis, and Portland (ME); it is somewhat available
according to sources in seven other
areas (Baltimore, Birmingham,
Columbia [SC], Los Angeles, Miami,
Philadelphia, and Washington, DC);
and it is not or not widely available
elsewhere. The epidemiologic source
in Sioux Falls regards liquid ecstasy as
somewhat available, and the epidemiologic
source in El Paso regards it as
widely available. All other respondents
report liquid ecstasy as not very
or not available.
<p>
As reported in the last <i>Pulse Check</i> and
according to law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic sources,
ecstasy tablets are white or colored,
and many are pressed with designs and
logos that change periodically. The
variety of designs or logos on ecstasy
tablets reported has increased dramatically
since the last <i>Pulse Check</i>.
Designs on ecstasy tablets common
across the country include "E,"
"mitsubishi," "mercedes," "playboy,"
and cartoon characters. Other designs
differ according to city. In Columbia
(SC), where a variety of stamped
tablets are available, some are home
pressed. According to the law enforcement
source in Denver, designs on
ecstasy seized at raves vary widely,
but designs on ecstasy seized in large
shipments are the same.

<p><b>How is street-level ecstasy
packaged?</b> Overwhelmingly, law
enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources agree that ecstasy
tablets are not typically packaged,
but sold as loose (or "naked") pills.
Additionally, in Denver, El Paso,
Miami, and Portland (ME), pills are
packaged in plastic bags; in Birmingham
and Denver, they are packaged
in prescription bottles; in Billings and
Honolulu, they are packaged in plastic coin bags; in New Orleans,
they are packaged in plastic logoemblazoned
coin bags, similar to
powder cocaine packaging; in St.
Louis, they are packaged in cigarette
boxes; in Philadelphia, they are
strung on necklaces; and in Seattle,
they may be concealed in the ends of
glow necklaces.

<p>
<b>What are street-level ecstasy
prices across the country?</b>
<i>(<a href="#cluex6">Exhibit 6</a>)</i> The most commonly
reported unit of ecstasy sold is one
tablet (approximately 100–150 milligrams
according to the Miami law
enforcement source and 150–250
milligrams according to the Seattle
law enforcement source), selling at
$12.50–$38 in the Northeast,
$20–$30 in the Midwest, $18–$50 in
the South, and $20–$45 in the West.
Between fall 2000 and spring 2001,
according to law enforcement,
epidemiologic, and ethnographic
sources, prices remained stable, with
one exception: according to the law enforcement source in Chicago,
prices increased. Other units of ecstasy
sold in <i>Pulse Check</i> cities include
small tablets (50–150 milligrams) for
$10–$20 apiece in Seattle, one jar of
100 pills for $3,000 in Sioux Falls,
and wholesale units at $6–$18 in
New York and $7–$8 in Miami.

<p><b>ECSTASY: SALES</b>
<p>
<b>Who sells ecstasy?</b> Young adults
are the predominant street-level
ecstasy sellers, according to most (20
of 29) law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic respondents.
Five sources (in Birmingham, Denver,
New Orleans, St. Louis, and Sioux
Falls) report ecstasy sellers as evenly
split between young adults and
adolescents, and four (in Baltimore,
Boston, Memphis, and Seattle) report
sellers as primarily adolescents. A
summary of ecstasy drug market
characteristics appears in <a href="#cluex11">exhibit 11</a>
at the end of this section.

<p>Street-level ecstasy sellers tend to be
independent, according to most (19
of 30) law enforcement, epidemiologic
and ethnographic respondents.
Five respondents report ecstasy as
organized, and five claim that ecstasy
sellers are evenly split between being
independent and organized, with
organized sellers more involved in
raves and nightclub sales than
independent sellers. For example,
in Denver and Portland (ME),
"house dealers" at raves may be in
charge of ecstasy sales, with their
"runners" distributing drugs to individual
buyers; in Miami, organized
sellers in clubs tend to be connected
with drug trafficking; and in Los
Angeles, sellers tend to be affiliated
with organized crime. In Columbia
(SC) and Denver, independent sellers
are college students or those who
have access to the college scene.

<p><b>Are ecstasy sellers involved in
other crimes?</b> Most law enforcement
respondents (13 of 19) report
that street-level ecstasy sellers are not
typically involved in other crimes.
Reports of "somewhat" or "very likely"
involved in other crimes are given
by six respondents (in Baltimore,
Detroit, Portland (ME), Memphis,
Miami, and New Orleans). Furthermore,
ecstasy dealers are not typically
involved in violence, according to 16
of 17 respondents. Only the Baltimore
source associates violent crimes
with ecstasy sellers. Other crimes
associated with ecstasy sellers include
drug-assisted rape in Baltimore,
Denver, Los Angeles, and Memphis;
domestic violence in Baltimore,
gang-related activity in Honolulu;
and prostitution (users prostituting
for the drug) in Birmingham.

<p>
Epidemiologic and ethnographic
respondents report that ecstasy dealers
are less involved in other crimes
than do the law enforcement sources.
Most (seven of eight) epidemiologic/
ethnographic respondents report
those selling ecstasy are "not at all"
or "not very likely" to be involved in
other crimes. Similar to the Baltimore
law enforcement response, according
to the epidemiologic source, ecstasy
sellers are somewhat likely to be
involved in other crimes in that city.
Other crimes reported by epidemiologic
and ethnographic sources are
typically nonviolent crimes, although
ecstasy sellers are reported to be
involved in prostitution and violent
crimes in Baltimore and gang-related
crimes in Memphis.

<p>
<b>Do ecstasy sellers use their own
drug?</b> Similar to information in the
last <i>Pulse Check</i>, nearly all (25 of 27)
law enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic respondents believe that
ecstasy sellers are somewhat or very
likely to use the drug. Only in
Baltimore (by the epidemiologic
source) and Miami (by the law enforcement
source) are ecstasy
sellers reported as not very likely
to use the drug.

<p>
<b>Where is street-level ecstasy
sold?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex8">Exhibit 8</a>)</i> According to 20
law enforcement respondents, ecstasy
sales take place in a wide variety of
areas, mostly central cities and suburbs. Law enforcement sources in
six cities (Columbia [SC], Denver,
New York, Philadelphia, Portland
[ME], and Washington, DC) report
ecstasy sales in all areas of the cities.
Similarly, according to epidemiologic
and ethnographic respondents, the
locations of ecstasy sales vary widely,
occurring mostly in central city and
suburban areas.

<a href="index.html#backcluex8"><div align="center"><p>Back to Exhibits</div></a>

<p>Raves and concerts, nightclubs and
bars, college campuses, private residences,
private parties, and inside
cars remain the primary settings for
ecstasy sales as reported by law
enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources. Reinforcing the
widespread availability of ecstasy,
common sales settings also include
schools, streets, shopping malls, and
the Internet. Less common settings
include public housing developments
in Miami, New Orleans, and Sioux
Falls; playgrounds or parks in New
Orleans and Honolulu; hotels and
motels in Columbia (SC); and many
types of social gatherings, regardless
of setting, in Baltimore.

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#bdc6de" align="center"><tr><td><span class="rtext"><b>Ecstasy sales and user settings: A
closer look</b>
<p>
The numbers of different ecstasy sales
settings and user settings mentioned
tend to be larger in the southern and
western cities, possibly indicating wider
availability and use in those regions.
Ecstasy sales settings tend to overlap
with user settings in most cities, but
typically more settings are mentioned
for sales than for use.</font></td></tr></table>

<p><b>How is street-level ecstasy sold?</b> Ecstasy sales typically involve handto-hand sales through acquaintance
networks, according to most (24 of
29) law enforcement, epidemiologic, and ethnographic respondents.
Additionally, beepers or cell phones
are used in 10 cities (Baltimore,
Billings, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu,
Memphis, Miami, New Orleans, St.
Louis, and Washington, DC).
According to law enforcement
respondents, the drug is distributed
by delivery-type services in five cities
(Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis,
New Orleans, and St. Louis), and it is
sold via the Internet in four cities
(Detroit, Honolulu, Memphis, and
New Orleans). Conversely, epidemiologic
and ethnographic respondents
do not report the use of delivery-type
services or the Internet for ecstasy
sales. According to the Memphis law
enforcement source, ecstasy transactions
are conducted via introductions;
that is, sellers are introduced to
potential buyers by a liaison or
mutual acquaintance who can vouch
for the seller.


<p>
<b>What other drugs do ecstasy
dealers sell?</b> According to most (12
of 18) law enforcement respondents,
ecstasy sellers also tend to sell other
drugs. By contrast, according to most
(6 of 8) epidemiologic and ethnographic
respondents, ecstasy sellers
do not typically sell other drugs.
Other drugs sold by ecstasy dealers, according to law enforcement,
epidemiologic, and ethnographic
sources, include other club drugs
(especially GHB, ketamine, and LSD),
heroin, powder and crack cocaine,
marijuana, methamphetamine (where
it is available), and other diverted
prescription drugs. The Philadelphia
law enforcement sources states that
LSD is often sold as an ecstasy
substitute.
<p><b>ECSTASY: THE USERS</b>
<p>
<b>How has the number of novice
ecstasy users in treatment
changed?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex9">Exhibit 9</a>)</i> According to
most (9 of 15) non-methadone treatment
respondents, the number of
novice ecstasy users in treatment
(defined as any drug treatment client
who has recently begun using ecstasy)
has increased since the last reporting
period, with the remaining respondents
reporting stable trends. Only
one methadone treatment source (in
Boston) responded to the question,
reporting an increasing number of
novice ecstasy users in treatment.


<p><b>Who uses ecstasy?</b> Similar to
information in the last <i>Pulse Check</i>,
ecstasy users tend to be young (13–30
years), evenly split between genders,
White, and of middle to high SES,
according to epidemiologic, ethnographic,
and non-methadone treatment
sources. In general, methadone
treatment sources did not provide
information about club drug users.

<p>
Of 17 epidemiologic and ethnographic
respondents, most (15) report
that ecstasy users are predominantly
White, and of these, most (13) report
that Whites are overrepresented compared
with the general population in
their cities. Only in Baltimore are
Blacks the predominant ecstasy users,
but they are underrepresented compared with the general population
in that city. In El Paso, Hispanics
are the predominant ecstasy users, at
proportions about equal to that of the
general population. Most ecstasy
users range from middle to high SES,
according to 18 epidemiologic
and ethnographic sources, with 2
exceptions: in Baltimore, predominant
users are of low SES, and in Portland
(ME), ecstasy users are distributed
somewhat evenly among all SES categories.
A summary of ecstasy users and
use characteristics appears in Exhibit
12 at the end of this section.

<p>Non-methadone treatment provider
respondents (12) agree with epidemiologic
and ethnographic sources and
report that ecstasy users in treatment
tend to be adolescents and young
adults, with the Honolulu source
reporting the emerging group of
ecstasy users in treatment as mostly
preadolescents. Also similar to
reports by epidemiologic sources,
most (8 of 13) treatment respondents
state that ecstasy users in treatment
are split evenly between genders, and
most (8 of 13) report ecstasy users in
treatment as predominantly Whites
and overrepresented or about
proportionate to the general
population. Although most treatment
respondents (9 of 12)
state that ecstasy users in
treatment are predominantly of
middle SES, two (in Memphis
and Billings) report them as predominantly
of low SES, and the
Los Angeles source reports them
as of both low and middle SES.
Additionally, in three cities (Boston,
New Orleans, and Seattle), emerging
ecstasy users in treatment are predominantly
of low SES.

in central cities (except in
Philadelphia, where they reside in
both the central city and suburbs); in
the West, they reside predominantly
in central cities and suburbs; in the
South, they reside in central cities,
rural areas, and suburbs; and in the
Midwest, they reside predominantly
in suburbs (except in Chicago, where
they reside in both the central city
and suburbs).

<p><b>Where and in what contexts do
ecstasy users tend to use the
drug?</b> <i>(<a href="#cluex8">Exhibit 8</a>)</i> Similar to settings
for ecstasy sales, settings for ecstasy
use, in descending order of the most
frequently mentioned by law enforcement,
epidemiologic, and ethnographic
respondents, include raves,
nightclubs, private parties, private
residences, and college campuses.
Since the last reporting period, several
new user settings have been added
to the list, including playgrounds and
parks, public housing developments,
shopping malls, streets, inside cars,
and around schools. Ecstasy use
occurs predominantly indoors, according
to epidemiologic and ethnographic sources. All 18 respondents report that
ecstasy is predominantly used in
groups or among friends, but in
Miami, ecstasy users are beginning
to use the drug alone and in private.

<p>
<b>How is ecstasy used and what
other drugs do ecstasy users
take?</b> Predominant route of administration
among ecstasy users remains
oral, according to epidemiologic,
ethnographic, and non-methadone
treatment respondents. Additionally,
in Miami and St. Louis, some users
are beginning to snort or inject the
drug; in New Orleans, it is mixed in
beverages; and in Birming-ham
and Washington, DC, it is dissolved
in hot beverages.
<p>
Ecstasy continues to be used
in combination with other
drugs, including other club drugs
(such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms,
GHB, ketamine, and nitrous
oxide) across the country; marijuana
in the South, West, and Philadelphia;
methamphetamine in the West, Memphis,
Washington, DC, and Chicago
(where the practice is rare); heroin in
Memphis, Miami, and St. Louis; powder
cocaine in Memphis and Seattle;
and diverted prescription depressants
in Miami. "Candy flipping," the use of
ecstasy and LSD, was mentioned in
several areas: Chicago, Denver,
Hono-lulu, Memphis, Miami,
Philadelphia, and Washington, DC.
In Los Angeles and Miami, Viagra®
(sildenafil citrate) is used with ecstasy.
Exhibit 4 lists slang terms for club
drug combinations.

<p>
According to non-methadone treatment
respondents, the most common
club drug combination is ecstasy and
marijuana. Emerging combinations
include ecstasy and diverted OxyContin® (a time-release, high-dosage formulation of oxycodone) in Boston;
ecstasy and LSD in Columbia (SC);
and ecstasy and high-purity methamphetamine
("ice") or cocaine in Honolulu.

<p><b>OTHER CLUB DRUGS: THE DRUGS</b>

<p>
<b>What are the common forms of
GHB, ketamine, and Rohypnol,
and how are they packaged?</b> The
most common form of GHB available
is liquid, typically clear, as reported
by law enforcement, epidemiologic,
and ethnographic respondents.
Additionally, a powder form of the
drug is somewhat available in New
Orleans and Los Angeles. GHB as a
liquid is packaged in a variety of ways
depending upon locality. Common
packaging includes plastic bottles
(typically water, sports drink, or soda
bottles) in Birmingham, Chicago,
Columbia (SC), Detroit, Los Angeles,
Memphis, Miami, New Orleans, and
St. Louis; eyedropper bottles in
Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami;
and vials (glass or plastic) in Billings,
Boston, Miami, Philadelphia, St.
Louis, and Washington, DC. GBL and
1,4 BD (GHB precursors) are available
in some areas, including Boston,
Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans,
and Sioux Falls. Many respondents
do not distinguish between GHB and
its precursors.

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#bdc6de" align="center"><tr><td><span class="rtext"><b>Ecstasy users in treatment: A
closer look</b>
<p>
The most common treatment referral
sources for ecstasy users in treatment,
according to 13 non-methadone treatment
respondents, are health care
providers (in Billings, Columbia [SC],
Denver, and Miami), court or criminal
justice referrals (in Denver, Miami, St.
Louis, and Sioux Falls), and secondary
school referrals (in Denver, Los Angeles,
and St. Louis). The non-methadone
treatment source in St. Louis comments
that most ecstasy users in treatment who
were referred by schools were sent to
treatment because they were caught with
marijuana on school property. Similarly,
according to the Boston methadone
treatment source, another drug besides
ecstasy, typically abuse of diverted OxyContin®, tends to be the primary reason
an ecstasy user is in treatment. According
to the non-methadone source in
Columbia, ecstasy users in treatment initially
claim to be addicted to drugs other
than ecstasy, but clients often later reveal
that ecstasy tends to be their primary
drug of use.
<p>
Six of 10 non-methadone treatment
respondents (in Denver, Honolulu,
Memphis, Portland [ME], St. Louis, and
Sioux Falls) report that ecstasy clients
typically use the drug one to two times
per week, three respondents (in Los
Angeles, Miami, and Sioux Falls) report
that ecstasy clients use one to two times
per month, and the source in Columbia
(SC) reports that they use three to four
times per week. In Honolulu, the frequency
of ecstasy use among adolescent
clients has increased since the last
reporting period.</font></td></tr></table>

<p>Diverted ketamine is available predominantly
in liquid and powder
forms, according to responding law
enforcement, epidemiologic, and
ethnographic sources. It is typically
bought and sold as a liquid and taken orally or converted into powder for
snorting. Additionally, the liquid form
is injected in Boston, Detroit, and
Washington, DC; the drug is available
in pill form in Los Angeles and New
York; and the liquid form is poured in
drinks in Boston. Ketamine is illegally
sold primarily by the plastic bag as a
powder or by the vial as a liquid.
Furthermore, according to the
Columbia (SC) law enforcement
source, sellers transfer ketamine from
prescription vials into plain vials to
avoid connection with the pharmacy or
veterinary office from which it was
stolen. The Memphis law enforcement
source states that ketamine powder is
sold in foil or in folded paper, and the
New Orleans law enforcement source
reports that liquid ketamine is sold in
plastic soda or sports drink bottles.
Ketamine is sold in powder form if it is
used in clubs and raves in Washington,
DC, and in liquid form if it is to be
delivered outside of the District,
according to the law enforcement
source.

<p>
Rohypnol is available in pill form,
according to respondents in all areas
where it is available, and is sold as
loose pills, except in New Orleans
(according to the law enforcement
source), where it is packaged in plastic
bowls or small plastic bags.

<p>
<b>How much are GHB, ketamine,
and Rohypnol across the country?</b>
<i>(<a href="#cluex10">Exhibit 10</a>)</i> Where
available, GHB sells primarily as a
liquid by the dose, with a dose usually
comprising bottle capfuls or drops.
One dose (a "shot" or "swig") costs
$5–$20 in <i>Pulse Check</i> cities.
Additionally, in Birmingham, dealers
are putting GHB in water guns, and
users are paying for it by the squirt.
In Miami, candy, typically lollipops,
is dipped in GHB and sold. In Columbia (SC), a product containing
GHB (liquid Verve®) was given away
as a promotional item in a nutritional
supplement store. In Miami, a 32
ounce bottle of GBL or 1,4 BD sells
for $40–$70. Reported prices for
GHB have remained stable since the
last reporting period, except in Los
Angeles, where they have dropped
due to increased availability.
<p>
The prices for diverted ketamine vary
based on the form of the drug and
unit available. Prices have remained
stable since the last reporting period,
with two exceptions: increases due to
decreasing availability are reported in
Los Angeles and Portland (ME).
Rohypnol prices are reported in only
five cities (Chicago, El Paso, Los
Angeles, Memphis, and New Orleans)
and range widely (from $1 to $25),
but have not changed since the last
reporting period.

ketamine, and Rohypnol used?</b> Club drug combinations include GHB
with alcohol across the country; with
ecstasy in Chicago, Los Angeles,
Miami, and Seattle; with marijuana
in Birmingham and Miami; and with
ketamine in Denver. Ketamine is
combined with ecstasy in Chicago,
Miami, and Washington, DC; with
marijuana in Detroit and Miami; with
LSD in Chicago; and with methamphetamine
in Birmingham. Rohypnol
is combined with marijuana in
Birmingham and Miami, LSD and
ecstasy in Miami, heroin and powder
cocaine in El Paso, where the speedball
effect (in this case, Rohypnol, a
depressant, and cocaine, a stimulant)
is reported to "soften the fall when
