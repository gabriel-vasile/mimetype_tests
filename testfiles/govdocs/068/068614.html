Iraq Watch<br>
 What's The Plan For Post-War Iraq?<br>
July 14, 2003</strong></p>
</div>
<div align="Justify"><b>The 
SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Feeney).</b> Under the Speaker's announced policy 
of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, for 5 or 6 weeks, a number 
of us have been coming to the floor to discuss our Nation's involvement and 
our role in Iraq. We have at least four times come here, four of us, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel),
and the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), and have had a discussion
and a lively give and take about Iraq, about what is going right over there,
what is going wrong, trying to seek the truth, trying to suggest policy changes,
trying to have a full discussion and report to the people of this country.
And we have decided to do this every week, every week that the House is in
session as long as our country is involved in Iraq.       <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to call ourselves the Iraq Watch because we think 
that there are important public policy matters that the American people need 
to be aware of, that Congress needs to focus on, we need to ask questions 
about, seek information about, to clarify, to seek policy changes, to make 
some changes and fundamentally to report to the people of this country on 
what we know and what we think we all ought to know about what has happened 
in Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, of the four I named, two of us voted in favor of the military 
authority sought by the President and two of us voted ``no'' to exercise that
authority. But we all were sold, as was the entire Congress and the American
people, with great certainty by the administration and by the President that
Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction last fall when the vote was
approaching and that he was trying to develop more. The certainty was expressed
in public. The certainty was expressed in private. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I have, along with a number of Members of Congress, attended 
a briefing at the White House, one of a series of briefings. In my case, we
were briefed by Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Advisor, and George 
Tenet, the director of the CIA. We were told with certainty that Saddam Hussein 
had weapons of mass destruction and was trying to develop more. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there is no question that in the past Hussein had weapons 
of mass destruction. That has been proven. He used them. He used weapons of
mass destruction against his own people. He used them against the Kurds. And
he used them against innocent civilians in Iraq. He used them in murderous 
ways. That is beyond question. But what we were told is that he had them in
the fall of 2002, that he was developing more, and that he was an impediment 
to the peace in the Middle East and to our Nation's security and because of
that imminent threat, we needed to exercise preemptive military power to
disarm Saddam Hussein. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I voted for it. I would do so again being told the same information 
as we were told then. I imagine that some of my colleagues who voted ``no'' 
would vote ``no'' again. But the question is we are discovering that things 
may not have been just what we thought they were. We certainly have won a 
great military victory. Our armed services, our young men and women in uniform 
performed admirably and with great courage in Iraq. But we have got two questions, 
this group has two questions: Fundamentally, is our military mission complete 
and are we winning the peace in Iraq? And I would submit before I yield to 
my colleagues that the military mission is not complete and cannot be complete 
as long as there has not been an accounting of the weapons of mass destruction, 
where are they and who controls them, and what went wrong regarding our intelligence, 
how was our intelligence collected, and how was it used by the White House 
and by the political leadership, and are we doing the right things from a 
policy standpoint to win the peace. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And I suggest that this group of four and many of our colleagues 
have a lot of questions about this. I know those questions are shared by the
American people; I hope we can give voice to these questions in this Iraq
Watch. I hope we can come up with some answers or seek those answers from
the administration, and I hope we can report back on a regular basis once
a week to the American people. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I yield now to my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Emanuel). <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) for organizing this. It is interesting that 
you noted we were militarily successful, and I think everybody takes pride 
in what our men and women in uniform did in pursuing the mission that they 
were on. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; What I think is unfortunate is that they went into that mission 
without a plan for the occupation and without a sense of how to seek and secure
that peace once the war was over. And that is something that the civilian 
leaders, that is the type of leadership that the civilian leaders needed to
provide and did not. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you an example of that point. After the war and 
hostilities ceased in both Bosnia and Kosovo, not a single American soldier 
was killed in action after the hostility ceased. Why? Because in both cases 
we had a plan for the occupation, and we had allies, two things missing in 
this endeavor. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; As recently as May, when the Defense Department said we could 
have won the war and secured peace with 50,000 troops, we now have 150,000 
troops. Today there was an announcement that there would be postponement of
any troops going home. So no family member knows an exact date as far as
the eye can see on the horizon, and there may even be a further call-up for
further troops. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? 
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague put it also 
today, India has made a decision through its democratic process that it will 
not send troops unless there is a United Nations resolution. What I am very, 
very concerned about is, are we going to end up in Iraq with a vast majority 
of troops assigned there to ensure security and stability as Americans? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard from the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld,
that there will be additional foreign troops sent to Iraq, but when we ask
the question where are these troops coming from, what are their numbers,
we are met with silence basically. Again, there are reports coming from military 
sources that indicate that if the situation continues to deteriorate in Iraq 
we very well might need double, double, the number of troops to ensure again 
stability and security for the Iraqi people. <br>
       <br>
       <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL.</b> Mr. Speaker, I would like to note 
that on the occupation, not only are our troops there, 150,000 U.S. troops 
now, permanently stationed there, and as my colleague noted that there are 
other countries who will not, like India, participate without the U.N. There 
is nothing that has occurred in the postwar Iraq that was not predictable 
or foreseen pre the war. And I think that although there is a great argument 
about 16 words that were legitimately said in the well of this Chamber, the 
people's House, and it is a legitimate question, I think one of the greatest 
travesties, and I would hope that we would have an inquiry in either the House
or the other Chamber, any investigation, on how we went to war without an
exit strategy. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a bipartisan agreement for a long time that
we never will send American troops, at least post-Vietnam, we would never
send American troops into combat without knowing how to exit. We have no
plan for the peace and we have no plan to secure the exit of our American
men and women. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, I can assure the gentleman, 
as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) can, that there was no 
lack of trying to get that exit strategy from the administration last fall. 
I wrote letters to the President. I know the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Delahunt) participated in similar efforts. He and I serve on the Committee 
on International Relations. There was great efforts at hearings as well as 
individual letters written to the administration seeking information. <br>
       <br>
       <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, if I may ask then, the 
gentleman sought pre the war, when there was still the debate in this country 
going on, if we are there, we win, how are we coming home. That question was
attempted to seek an answer? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Yes. <br>
       <br>
       <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. And there were never any answers 
to those questions. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. The gentleman is correct, there were not 
answers. And there were many more questions, certainly in my letter? How much
will it cost? How many troops will it take? How many allies will go in with
us? How many allies will stay with us in the post-conflict exercise?    
  <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The military victory was never in doubt. No one doubted that, 
but the question was what kind of risk were we assuming, would we have friends 
to help us, to absorb some of the cost and to take on some of the responsibility 
so that the United States would not alone be the subject of frustration and 
anger after the fact, which is exactly what is happening. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty American soldiers have been assassinated, attacked,
ambushed and assassinated since the President declared military victory.
About 75 altogether have died, but 30 have been killed directly. <br>
       <br>
       <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would 
continue to yield for a second, according to the Associated Press today, I
think as well both killed and died in a humvee accident, there has been 84
deaths in 79 days since the President landed on the Lincoln aircraft carrier. 
Eighty-four Americans have died, 30 plus through assassination, others through 
humvees turning over, other accidents, but 84 Americans are not coming home 
to their loved ones, to see their children. There is no doubt. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I think that that, to me, one of the great travesties here
is that there is not a plan for the occupation. There is not a plan for the 
exit strategy. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And last week we learned now finally after, I do not know why 
we have to browbeat this answer, but we have spent and are planning on spending 
$1 billion a week. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. As far as the eye can see. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr. EMANUEL</b>. That is right, a minimum of 4 years. That 
is $50 billion a year if my math works, and I still I think I am pretty good 
at it. That comes to $200 billion on the occupation side of Iraq. We spend 
$12 billion, $12 billion on just college assistance at the Federal level, 
$12 billion versus $200 billion. Two billion dollars would give health insurance 
to every uninsured American and guarantee a bare minimum for the other, not 
just the 42 million but those who are actually being cut from the rolls. 
     <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; There is much that we can do here at home for that same cost, 
not that we are not for the reconstruction of Iraq. Now that we have won the
war, I think we all believe that it is pretty essential to invest in Iraq's
future, but, remember, this is the very time that we are going to invest.
This is $50 billion we are going to spend now on Iraq this year for the occupation.
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Our colleagues and a number of them have a rebuild America
account for $50 billion to be roads, bridges, economic development, investment
in infrastructure to move people and goods and services. We will not find
the money for that. Yet we are going to do more deficit financing and burden 
our country with debt to build $50 billion worth of occupation resources for
Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to 
note that those estimates, and my colleague just used them of $50 billion, 
are based on what we know today. The reality is, back in April, Secretary 
Rumsfeld recently acknowledged that the amount of dollars necessary, simply 
for the military presence, put aside the cost of reconstruction, that estimate 
has doubled from some $2 billion to $4 billion a month. I dare say that I 
would not be surprised if 6 months from now we find that that $4 billion estimate
has mushroomed to a significantly higher amount. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I think we also owe a debt to the recently retired General
of the Army, General Shinseki, who when he mentioned that at least 200,000
troops was necessary to ensure peace and stability in Iraq, that estimate
by the General was dismissed, in fact derided, by Secretary Rumsfeld, who
mentioned a figure of 125,000. This is beginning to remind me of those CBO
estimates, about surplus, of trillions of dollars of surpluses on an annual
basis that have turned into deficits as far as the eye can see. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, the number of troops and the estimate of just the 
cost of sustaining a military presence there is $4 billion. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue 
to yield, as my colleague knows, as I think all my colleagues know, as they 
obviously tried to get answers to how we were going to secure the country, 
how many allies we are going to have, what was our exit strategy, and it was
like pulling teeth to get that. We tried to get answers to the questions how
much would it cost, how many troops. Anybody that spoke in the hundreds of
thousands were forced out. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now we are trying to get answers for who put a statement in 
the President's State of the Union, and we are now ended up blaming the Italians 
it looks like. First, it was the British. The British blamed the Italians. 
The Italians say they do not know where the document came from. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The director of the CIA, all the men and women in Virginia
have done a wonderful job dedicating their lives to trying to assess information 
and give our civilian leaders the best intelligence and estimates they have, 
and every time we try to get information it is pulling teeth. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, we know 
exactly whose fault it was. It is George Tenet. That is what Condoleeza Rice 
is saying. That is what the Vice President is saying. Everybody's quite willing 
to blame George Tenet for that information being in the State of the Union 
that should not have been there. Does anybody in this House or watching throughout 
America believe that George Tenet alone is responsible? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Single-handedly. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I have written a
few or participated in a few of the processes of writing a State of the Union. 
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In October, this line about gathering uranium from Niger was 
edited out of the President's speech. The way it works in the White House 
is that speech is sent around to the NSE team. So State looks at it, Defense 
looks at it, CIA looks at it, FBI I am sure gets a little clearance through 
Justice, probably not the FBI, and they check the assignment. There is an 
editing. The national security staff underneath Condoleeza Rice has to run 
that process. So the same people that were working on the October speech that
dismissed this assessment of Niger was the same group working on the State
of the Union. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; How one person is responsible, that what was a team effort
in October but has become a single person failure in January, only 3 months 
later, when nothing changed, as we would say back in Chicago, that dog just 
will not hunt. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Do they really say that in Chicago? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Periodically, on the northwest side, we 
have a couple of dogs that hunt. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, can I just add to that? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I was interested in the comments that were made by representatives 
of the administration during the course of the past 3 or 4 days, including 
the statement obviously by the director of Central Intelligence. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, as my colleague points out, the statements themselves 
I think create more confusion. There is more ambiguity and less clarity now 
as to what happened. So while it might be that George Tenet, the director 
of Central Intelligence, ought to have made a comment about the inclusion 
of the accusation relative to the West Africa country of Niger, I guess the 
question is, who put those words in there to begin with? Who put it in there? 
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell my colleagues what I find. I think the only reasonable 
conclusion that can be drawn is that we have different agencies or individuals 
within the agencies that have access to information, that we are not communicating 
with each other. And that should really profoundly disturb all of us in the 
aftermath of the tragedy of September 11 because we should have learned from 
the attack on the United States on September 11 that cooperation and coordination 
are essential. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the gentleman from Illinois references the President 
made a speech on October 7 in Cincinnati. There was a reference to the purchase 
of highly enriched uranium from Niger. During the course of the review of 
that particular speech, the CIA correctly warned the President not to use 
that intelligence in that particular speech. Maybe he forgot about that particular 
process. Maybe he was unaware of it. <br>
       <b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, what I want to try to do is try 
to demystify this process. It was not like the CIA got the speech and itself 
edited it out. This is a coordinated process. National security does it, its
team. There is a domestic team. There is an economic team. So when the CIA
probably said, no, you cannot use this, everybody's eyes in State, Defense, 
NSE, everybody's eyes saw that it was not valid. That is the same team that 
edits and previews and reviews the President's speech in January. So everybody 
who was participatory in the October speech was the same body sitting in the
room participating in the State of the Union speech. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think again people this weekend, for whom George Tenet 
seems to be wearing the laundry, or they are throwing him under the truck, 
remember, this was not good enough 2 weeks later for the Secretary of State 
who said, and I am quoting, ``This is crap, I am not going to use this.'' 
The Secretary of State threw it out. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We had George Tenet sitting behind them at the U.N. 2 weeks 
after the State of the Union. They knew it was not good then. If it was not 
good enough for the Secretary of State 2 weeks after the State of the Union, 
it was not good enough for the President in October, but somehow it has become 
good enough for the President at the State of the Union, a speech on the doorstep
of a war where the world was hanging on every word. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. It is as if the right hand did not know 
what the left hand was doing. It is as if nobody is in charge. That is the 
only reasonable conclusion that one can infer from this murky explanation, 
this passing almost a legalistic argument. <br>
       <b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL</b>. Remember, the same people that wrote that
speech were participating in crafting this policy, and they have now set
out a course of $1 billion a week of occupation, $50 billion a year of U.S.
taxpayer money for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. Yet when we
talk this week about increasing funding for Head Start, we are told no money.
Last week when we voted and there was a 6-year freeze put on Pell Grants,
college assistance for people trying to open up the doors for higher education
for themselves, we are told there are no resources. Yet we will be asked
later on to commit resources to the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq
to the tune of $50 billion. Yet here at home, we will be told there are no
resources for health care or infrastructure. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The gentleman may say that the right hand did not know what 
the left hand was doing; I wonder if anybody knows what they are planning 
in Iraq and what they are planning here at home when it comes to our own economic
development. The American people from World War II forward have been tremendously
generous around the world, and yet they cannot continue to be asked to be
that generous when their own needs and hopes and dreams for their own children
are being denied, whether that is in the area of health care, investment
in our environment, or our own economic development. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie). <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. ABERCROMBIE</b>. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Delahunt) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) have asked some 
questions not just for rhetorical effect, but which throw some light on some 
very interesting aspects of this whole dilemma, which the Secretary of Defense 
says is over with, which the National Security Adviser says we have to move 
on from. I am asking why. Who committed these forgeries? I keep hearing about 
it. I keep asking the questions. We cannot get anybody in front of us to answer
the questions. Who committed these forgeries? The word ``forgery,'' the phrase
is used all the time; but there does not seem to be the slightest inclination
to find out what was at stake. Did they appear by spontaneous combustion?
Was this an immaculate conception of forgery? I do not think so. There were
reasons for it. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now we see the aspect of the Sunday talk shows. They are very 
interesting these days. Turn off the sound and watch the eyes and the expressions 
of the people who are speaking. Just watch that. Get the body language down, 
and Members will see the tension that is there because they do not want to 
answer the question who benefited from having this kind of an observation 
in that speech by the President. It has nothing to do with 16 words or a single
sentence. It has everything to do with the reasons behind that being recommended
to the President. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This is not an accusation against the President. We are not 
going to determine that down here tonight as to what the President did or 
did not do with respect to that speech. The President is having a difficult 
enough time as it is other than to say it was somebody else's fault. That 
is something that we can take up with the President when it comes to election 
time, but that is not the issue here. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The issue here is who and what was behind the insistence that 
that sentence and that that observation go into that speech. I think the answer
is out there. I think what is involved in that answer has to do with who
benefited from it. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, I think it is absolutely
essential that the American people receive the answers to that question and
to all the other questions that have been offered. Earlier this evening the
gentleman from the other side of the aisle mentioned the talk shows and the
statements that are being made have a political context to them. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We have been here, as the gentleman well knows, for 5 weeks 
posing these questions. This is not motivated by Democratic intent to secure 
political advantage. If we did not do this, we would be abrogating our responsibility 
within our system to find the truth. It is about a search for the truth, and
I dare say it is now time for the President of the United States and Congress
to come together to create an independent commission, not one that has partisan
overtones, but one, for example, that served this country well under the
leadership of two former Senators, a Republican from New Hampshire, Warren
Rudman, and a Democratic from Colorado, Gary Hart, who I think made an extraordinary
contribution by a year's worth of hearings, even more, which ended up with
a product that tragically predicted what occurred on September 11. We need
that because I do not want to hear on this floor accusations about partisanship.
This is about the future of America. That is what this is about. This ought
not be about politics. Let us depoliticize that now and let the Republican
and the Democratic leadership with the White House create an independent
commission to reveal to the American people the truth.       <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman; 
and before we go any further, we have been joined by the gentleman from Washington 
(Mr. Inslee), and <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee). <br>
       <b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. INSLEE</b>. Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly concur with the 
suggestion by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) that we need 
a bipartisan, independent investigation of this. The reason that I have joined 
this effort tonight, and I have delayed doing so for a few weeks in the hopes 
that the administration would be more forthcoming about this intelligence 
failure, but what inspired me to come here tonight are the comments of Condoleezza 
Rice and Mr. Rumsfeld who said this is the end of the story; we can forget 
about these issues. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am here to say this is not the end of the story; this is
maybe the end of the beginning of the story. The type of questions that Americans 
are asking tonight as to how a fraudulent, forged document got into the address 
of the leader of the free world to the people of this country and to the world
and to the House of Representatives, how that happened is just one of the
questions. I know many of us have been hearing a lot of talk and dialogue 
about how that happened. And it was as predictable as rain in Seattle that 
George Tenet was going to get thrown overboard by this administration at some
point. It is amazing it took so long. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The point I want to make tonight is that I do not think we
should get seized on whether this was 16 words or 16,000 words. The fact
of the matter is that there is a whole boatload of other questions that this
independent Republican and Democratic commission needs answered, and I want
to pose just a couple. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The first question this commission needs to answer is why was 
the President successful in convincing over 50 percent of the Americans that 
Saddam Hussein was behind the attack on September 11 and was in cahoots with 
al Qaeda when in fact the intelligence had enormous amounts of information 
that that was not true? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Why did the President of the United States in urging America 
to start a preemptive war not level with the American people to tell the American
people all of the intelligence, not just the selective intelligence? And
let me just mention one fact. As reported in The New York Times on June 9,
2003, two of the highest-ranking leaders of al Qaeda in American custody have
told the CIA in separate interrogations that the terrorist organization did
not work jointly with the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein according to
several intelligence officials. Abu Zubaydah, a Qaeda planner and recruiter 
until his capture in March 2002, told questioners last year before the war 
that the idea of working with Mr. Hussein's government had been discussed 
among Qaeda leaders, but had been rejected. The same statement came from Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed, who insisted that the group did not work with Mr. Hussein.
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Do Members recall President Bush telling the American people 
that the two highest operatives in our custody in Guantanamo Bay had told 
our intelligence services that they had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein? 
I do not remember that information being disclosed to the American people, 
nor do I remember the President quoting Greg Fieldman, a former State Department 
intelligence official, who said, ``There was no significant pattern of cooperation 
between Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist operations.'' Intelligence agencies 
agreed on a ``lack of meaningful connection to al Qaeda'' and said so to the
White House and Congress. I do not recall the President sharing that intelligence
information with the United States or the world. <br>
       <b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Inslee) is familiar with the report that was printed 
last week in The New York Times that a senior intelligence agent, Iraqi intelligence 
agent by the name of Ahmed Al-Ani was arrested. I imagine the gentleman does 
remember, however, that some suggested he had met in Prague and the Czech 
Republic with Mohammed Atta, who was the ring leader in the attack on the 
United States back on 9/11. That appeared in the media and administration 
officials said that that evidence held up. That alleged meeting occurred in
April 2001, 5 months before 9/11. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, most intelligence agencies, both American and allies, 
have cast doubt on the credibility of that purported meeting; but it was used
by administration officials to argue there was an alliance of some sort between
Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. And of course we all know that the rationale
for the attack on Iraq was based on two premises: Saddam Hussein had in his
possession weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons or close
to achieving the development or the possession of nuclear weapons, and that
he could provide and was purportedly inclined to use terrorist organizations 
such as al Qaeda for the use of those weapons against the United States. 
     <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So that theory, as the gentleman suggests, was crucial, that 
fact of the alleged meeting was crucial to that particular theory. But again, 
there is serious doubt as to whether that meeting occurred. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting to note that both the FBI and the CIA investigated 
and could find no evidence whatsoever that at the pertinent times did Mr. 
Atta leave the United States to go to the Czech Republic for that meeting. 
However, it did serve the purpose of creating a sense of urgency that quick 
action had to be taken against Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. If the gentleman would yield, I would say 
there is a very legitimate need to look into and acquire through the rearview 
mirror how did we get to this point, what were the justifications; and I too
want to add my voice, although there has been a lot of controversy over the
weekend about how did the sentence get into the President's speech. It is
very important that we not lose sight, now that we are there, how was it
that we had no plan for this occupation. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Time Magazine reports that NATO allies, important allies who 
have been with us in Afghanistan and other missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, 
will not join us in Iraq. They do not see a U.N. legitimacy for the effort 
or plan for the occupation. There are important countries who have traditionally 
been shoulder to shoulder with America, were in Gulf War I, were in Bosnia, 
Kosovo, Afghanistan, every U.S. mission to free the world of a tyrant of some
nature, have decided not to join this effort and will not postwar join this
effort. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So as we look back, I think it is important to look forward. 
Again, I would remind my colleagues that in our plan for the reconstruction 
of Iraq we cite 20,000 units of housing for Iraq, yet the President's budget 
has 5,000 units of housing for America. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The President's reconstruction of Iraq calls for 13 million 
Iraqis, half the Iraqi population, to get universal health care. Yet 42 million 
Americans work full time with no health care and no plan for health care by
this administration. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; There are 4 million Iraqi children who will be provided early 
childhood education. This week on the House floor we will debate the Head 
Start bill. 58,000 children in America will be cut from Head Start. 1.2 million 
will never be given the opportunity who are eligible for Head Start to go 
to Head Start. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 12,500 schools in Iraq are planned for reconstruction and rebuilding 
with all books and supplies. Yet here in the United States, teachers must 
take out of their own salary the wages to pay for books and supplies. We have
to give them a tax credit to reimburse them what should be provided by the
school authority. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Umm Qasr port in Iraq is built from start to finish, from 
top to bottom; yet the Corps of Engineers is being cut by 10 percent here 
in the United States. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So as we rebuild Iraq, we reconstruct Iraq, America is in the 
process of its own deconstruction. If we do not have an economic plan for 
America that is beyond what has been provided and we do not have a plan for 
Iraq's reconstruction that includes our allies, I would remind my colleagues 
that in both Bosnia and Kosovo, we had a plan for the occupation and we had 
allies. The two things that are missing today, a plan and allies. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. ABERCROMBIE</b>. The gentleman's analysis brings forward 
again the question then: Who benefits from this reconstruction in Iraq? While 
we cannot have schools built in this country, while we cannot have hospitals 
paid for, when we cannot get health care for our people, who benefits? Who 
is getting the contracts for this? Who is getting the no-bid contracts? Where 
is the money coming from? Supposedly from the oil revenues. Oil revenues then
will be passing right out of Iraq and down to Texas, to Haliburton Company, 
to some of the other construction companies that are benefiting from hundreds 
of millions of dollars that are now being allocated into their pockets directly 
for this reconstruction, not in the United States but in Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EMANUEL. My colleague asks who is benefiting. I do not
have the answer to that, but I do have the answer for who is paying. That
is the United States taxpayer. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I want to remind our colleagues, for 60 years the American 
people have showed their unbelievable generosity. Every time they have been 
called upon to serve or to contribute, they have done it. Yet this is the 
one time in history that while we deny American people the access to education, 
health care and improved investment in their environment and economic development, 
we are asking them to call forth in a tremendous effort not seen since World 
War II to make an investment in another country's economic future when we 
have told them to shorten the horizons for their own children, to shorten 
their own homes and dreams for what they can provide their family. Yet we 
are calling upon them to once again show their generosity to Iraq that talks 
about a health care plan, an economic development plan, an education plan 
for Iraq and yet those same agenda items that we talk about here at home, 
we do not have. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; As we know, a number of my colleagues have signed on, I have 
my own bill called the American Parity Act that says whatever we invest in 
Iraq, whatever goal we set in Iraq, we have to set here at home equally. Whether
that comes from half the population getting health care, half the schools
being reconstructed and modernized, teachers being paid, 4 million kids in
early childhood education, reconstruction of a port for economic development
purposes, we have got to do that agenda item here at home. Otherwise, the
generosity of the American people showed over the last 60 years will come
short and rightfully so. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for 
pointing out the inconsistency of our admirable generosity to those overseas 
and our moral obligation to help rebuild a nation, a country that we had to
use military power against but our failure to live up to that same moral obligation
to our own citizens. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask my colleagues to respond to what we would like to 
see happen in Iraq. There are 8 or 10 or 15 things perhaps that we might recommend.
I would suggest one, and perhaps my colleagues can make further comment.
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I think we need to start with a full explanation by the President 
of his vision for what is happening, for the costs that he believes will be
necessary to complete the reconstruction, the timetable for that, the number
of U.S. military forces that would be needed. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The President needs to come clean. He has a growing credibility 
gap in my view because of the use and possible misuse of the intelligence 
leading up to the war, the statements made with such certainty that we are 
now learning the White House was being advised by intelligence agencies that 
things were not so certain at all and by the fact, as we have commented earlier 
tonight, that since the President, as our colleague from Illinois says, flew 
onto that aircraft carrier and declared victory, that 30 American soldiers 
have been assassinated and 84, as the gentleman points out, have died in some
fashion since military victory has been declared. We need to know what the
President thinks. We need to know what he believes will be necessary. He
has got to tell the American people what is coming. That would be my suggestion 
for just a fundamental need. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. EMANUEL</b>. I want to say one thing before I have to 
go, and our colleague from Massachusetts noted this. That is not a different 
question than the Republican Senator, RICHARD LUGAR, had asked, the head of
the Foreign Relations Committee. This again, I think it is important, we
have people with different views on the war, but these are questions not from
Democrats and <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Republicans, these are questions as God-loving and people who 
love their country who want to see America in front of the world stand tall 
are expecting. So the question you asked again is not a Democrat trying to 
get partisan political gain, it is a question that the Republican Senator, 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, asked, questions that another 
Senator, Republican from Nebraska, equally asked. This is not inquiry for 
political gain. We all now, regardless of party, are vested in our success 
and bringing as many of our men and women home as we can safely as soon as 
possible. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So your question I would also like to note so nobody who may 
tune in and turn on the television right now and think we are trying to get 
partisan or political advantage, note that these are similar questions that 
Republicans have asked, people of all stripes, from all backgrounds and all 
economic incomes and regardless of their political affiliations saying we 
need to get level here. Where is it we are going? How are we getting there? 
Whether it is an inquiry to what happened in the past but also an inquiry 
into the future. These are not Democratic questions. These are questions that
people who love their country think need to be answered. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. ABERCROMBIE</b>. Again in furtherance of what the gentleman 
from Illinois has indicated and others here this evening, these are the same 
questions that many of us asked of President Clinton. This is not something 
that has suddenly sprung into being. And they were asked in a bipartisan basis,
too. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues will remember that some of us, Republicans and 
Democrats alike, had these same questions for President Clinton with respect 
to Kosovo, with respect to the activities that took place in the Balkans. 
We had these same questions of ourselves as to what was expected of us. I 
think that as a result, what the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) 
has indicated is perhaps a start for us in terms of the questions that need 
to be asked, I think, needs a bit of reiteration. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I find it very strange that when President Carter was in office, 
people in the media, particularly Nightline, would come on every evening, 
day 292 of the hostages and the number of hostages that were still in Iran, 
on day 292, three, four, five, 300, whatever it was. Yet we go now to casualties, 
deaths, we are not talking about those that are maimed, and this casual dismissal 
by some of the, I am sorry to say, some of the highest officials in the administration 
now of, well, this is all over, intelligence changes from day to day. You 
never know what it is from day to day, this almost sarcastic dismissal of 
these questions. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; There are young people out at Walter Reed right now who may 
not have been killed, a casualty in that sense, but they are surely there 
as casualties, with loss of limbs and a lifetime in front of them of having 
to deal with the pain and suffering of grievous wounds. Perhaps Nightline 
might take up this idea. It is day, what number, since the President said 
that the war was over. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This is not something that we said. This is not something that 
other people said. This is something the President declared, and some of us
have been challenged on our patriotism and challenged on our support for troops
because we are not sufficiently quiet, because we do not acknowledge that
the so-called ending of the war really ended. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It does not end when somebody dies. It does not end when somebody 
is grievously wounded. It does not end when a parent or loved one has to try
and understand and we have to explain when we go home why the war is over
but the killing goes on and the maiming goes on. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So I think we are going to need to have some accounting as
to how many days past the end of the war the killing and the maiming goes
on and what those numbers are. Because those numbers are real. They are not 
philosophical abstractions. They are not merely the recitation of numbers 
from an Office of Management and Budget or a Congressional Budget Office, 
some entity, some institution that has no reality to the mothers and fathers 
and the loved ones of those who have to bear the brunt of the policies that 
we in the government of the United States are bringing forward to the people 
of the United States as being in the strategic interests of this Nation. 
     <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So I think that the questions that are being asked are not
just questions about the past and how something happened but to try and understand 
what took place in the past so that we do not continue to make the same mistakes 
and the same observations that lead to this kind of grievous result. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT.</b> The gentleman indicated that some, and 
very few, have questioned the patriotism of those who ask the questions that 
are being posed here tonight. It is my feeling and my position that it would 
be a failure, it would be unpatriotic not to pose these questions. And as 
others have indicated, this is not about partisanship. None of us here tonight 
and in the course of the past 4 or 5 weeks have indulged in partisan sniping. 
But I do believe that the President is at a particular moment in terms of 
his administration that he should intervene and stop the sniping that is occurring
within the administration, among individuals and agencies. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that a senior Iraqi intelligence agent
who was arrested last week, who purportedly had that information meeting
with Mohammad Atta, in that same report in the New York Times there was an
attack on the CIA by Mr. Richard Perle who currently serves on the Pentagon's
Defense Policy Board. I know the gentleman from Hawaii is aware that he resigned 
as chairman of the board because of potential conflict of interest concerns 
that he had since many of his private business clients stood to profit from 
contracts dealing with the reconstruction of Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted that Mr. Perle is considered a leader among 
the so-called neo-conservative bloc in the administration. He also has close 
ties with certain Iraqi exiles, such as Ahmed Chalabi. And it is true, and 
this should be stated very clearly, he advocated in an article that he wrote 
for the New York Times shortly after September 11 that the U.S. must strike 
at Saddam Hussein. So he is clearly predisposed towards the policy that was 
effected by this administration. My understanding is he was one of the most 
significant proponents of the war in Iraq. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, however, with the capture of this individual, Al-Ani,
he fears that if the CIA conducts the interrogation that they will play down 
evidence that the alleged meeting with Mohammad Atta ever occurred. With all
due respect to Mr. Perle, that is a very serious charge that impugns the
integrity of men and women in the CIA that risk their life in behalf of their
country every day of the year. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the CIA properly responded in my opinion that they 
need to be presented with something other than the opinions of Mr. Perle and
his suspicions; and they claim, and I have to agree, that he sounds to be
more predisposed to a certain conclusion than anyone they are familiar with.
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp; This quote that I read was he is just shopping for an interrogator 
who will cook the books to his liking. We cannot have that sniping going on.
It is time for the President to take charge and to intervene, be forthcoming, 
reveal all of the information. Presumably the interview with Mr. Al-Ani has 
occurred already. Let the American people know. Maybe he did have a meeting 
with Mohammed Atta; maybe he did not. But it is time to let the American people
know. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. INSLEE</b>. Mr. Speaker, I want to answer the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania's (Mr. Hoeffel) original question about what we should do
in Iraq now, with two points. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; One, I think it is important for the President to clear the 
decks to restore our credibility on this issue because our ability to act 
in Iraq is negatively affected by this credibility issue, and many of us believe
and I believe that the best thing the President could do in that regard is
to embrace a bipartisan review of the intelligence failure here. Having a
respected Republican like Warren Rudman or someone else run a commission to
have sort of a referee to figure out what happened here is a lot better than
to have the flacks at various agencies throwing grenades at each other in
the newspapers. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; If we really want to find out here why forgeries ended up at 
the State of the Union address, why we did not get the straight scoop about 
the intelligence coming out of Iraq, why the President told us there was no
doubt, and that was his word, no doubt that Iraq had some of the most lethal
weapons ever devised by man and we cannot find a thimbleful to date of mustard
gas, the best way is through an independent commission; and this is good
for the administration, not just good for the people. And this is not a debate.
We may find some of these weapons to date. That still may occur. This is
not a debate even about the propriety of the war. Even if one thinks the
war was justified about humanity and civil rights in Iraq, they have still
got to join us in a bipartisan belief that truth from the American President
is the most precious commodity we have in international affairs. We have
all got to be joining that in a bipartisan manner; so I say clearing the
decks first. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; But the second issue, if I can, it is just imperative that
we engage allies in this effort, in this maybe 2-, maybe 3-, maybe 4-, maybe 
5-year effort to restore order and some sense of civility in Iraq, and I would
encourage the administration to shuck aside its unilateral approach that
unfortunately they have adopted for so long in Iraq and welcome our allies
to get in there to shoulder some of this burden. Iraq is not a prize. It
is not a glorious prize for the American people. It is a burden. We still 
have people not coming home from Iraq, and that burden ought to be shared 
with every nation in the civilized world rather than just Americans. And to
date, unfortunately, this administration still has not been willing to embrace
allies to get them in there taking sniper fire instead of our neighbors' kids,
and I hope we will see it that way. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, it is time to pick up on
that to end grudge diplomacy. Let us get past that. Let us move on. Let us
understand that the only way we can bring stability to Iraq without breaking
the bank and without putting at risk the lives of American military personnel
is to bring in our traditional allies, whether they be the Germans or the
French. Let us put that in the past. Otherwise, we are going to see these
deficits that I referred to earlier balloon into numbers that will absolutely
be a drag of incredible magnitude on the American economy. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. ABERCROMBIE</b>. Mr. Speaker, on that point in reference 
to what the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) said and the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) observed to kick off this discussion, as the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) can see, his question was so pertinent
that we have not gotten much further in it, and for good reason, because
it requires some explication. The problem is here, if we do not do this,
is a credibility gap. What will the President be able to say about North
Korea? What will he be able to say about the Philippines? What will he be
able to say about Colombia? What will he be able to say further about Afghanistan?
      <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Afghanistan seems to have disappeared; yet I know there were 
two attacks yesterday, one on the American base and one on U.N. personnel. 
I do not believe anybody was killed, but who knows? Now we are told there 
are more attacks in Iraq than necessarily are being reported. I suppose that 
gets quotidian now. If they are on the 11 o'clock news at night, they have 
got fires to report, they have assaults to report or basketball players or 
the latest boxer to embarrass himself or something of that nature. They hardly 
have time to fit in anymore how many people got killed today. It is almost 
a loss leader in the news. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And so if we do not have some answers here, if the President 
does not take control and stop being dismissive of these questions as merely 
revising history or some other sarcastic observation, he is not going to be
able nor will the administration be able to convince others who may find it
in their interest to join with us in other circumstances. He will not be
able to find anyone who is going to be willing to take us at our word. That
is why this is so serious. It is way beyond partisan. Other people will occupy
these seats down here. Other people will come to occupy our place. We are
here only as long as the faith and trust of the people in our constituencies 
are willing to put us here. No one owns a seat in this Congress. No one owns 
a seat at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue either. We are only as good as the credibility 
with our own people before we can hope to influence others. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
his comments. I think our time is getting short. Any final comments from
the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) or the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Delahunt)? <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. DELAHUNT</b>. Mr. Speaker, I will just follow the gentleman 
from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) by saying that when I first heard the President 
in response to attacks on U.S. soldiers in the way that he does suggest bring 
them on, I remember wanting to say to the President that what we should be 
doing, President Bush, is to bring allies on to this coalition and make it 
a genuine coalition of democracies to assist in terms of the reconstruction 
so that American taxpayers do not bear the burden almost exclusively and that
American men and women who have served admirably can come home. <br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mr. HOEFFEL</b>. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
his comments. I thank the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie). The Iraq
Watch is going to be hard at work. I thank my colleagues for being part of
this. We will be back next week to ask more questions, to seek more information, 
and to try to better educate our colleagues in the Congress and the American 
people regarding the challenges of our role in Iraq. <br>
