_In Brief_

_NLS Announces Magazine Program Changes_

Beginning in January 1998, the National Library Service for the
Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) will offer readers new
magazine titles, some of which will be available in cassette
format.  Most of the current audio magazines will continue to be
available, but many popular magazines will be added to the
collection, replacing others that will be discontinued.  
     All children's, young adult, and foreign-language audio
magazines will be produced on cassette tape instead of flexible
disc.  These magazines will kick off a transition to the new
cassette format for all audio magazines.  NLS plans to continue
the transition in January 1999, changing another group of
flexible-disc magazines to cassette.  It is expected to take
three to four years before all NLS recorded magazines will be
available on cassette.
     The improvements to the magazine program are based on the
recommendations of two advisory committees composed of program
users and librarians.  One of the committees reviewed the titles
offered by NLS and, based on a survey of more than 3,500 patrons,
made recommendations about the types of magazines NLS should
offer to better meet readers' needs and interests.  The other
committee recommended producing recorded magazines on cassette
rather than flexible disc, a change that has been requested by
many patrons over the years.
     The revised list of magazines is shown below.  For current
titles that will continue to be offered, subscribers will not
experience any change and need not take any action. 
     Some magazines will be discontinued due to low interest in
them.  Patrons may find other titles of interest on the new list. 
Fall issues of discontinued magazines will carry notices
informing readers of the change.
