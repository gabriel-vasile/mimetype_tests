              the Plains Cree Indians</font><font color="#803038"><br>

            <p><font color="#803038">The following excerpts from the journals 
              of Lewis and Clark and their men present a picture of the Plains 
              Cree people as the Anglo-Americans saw them. The modern reader must 
              be careful to understand that what these white men saw and recorded 
              was not necessarily correct from the Indian perspective. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#803038">The following passages have been freely adapted 
              and excerpted from the original texts, and the spelling has been 
              corrected to make them easier to read. For students wishing to quote 
              these passages, the <i>Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,</i> 
              edited by Gary Moulton and published by the University of Nebraska 
              Press, is the recommended source. For those who wish more in-depth 
              information about Lewis and Clark's relations with various Indian 
              tribes, including background from the Indian perspective, the best 
              book is James P. Ronda's <i>Lewis and Clark among the Indians.</i> 
              Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984. The very best way to 
              obtain accurate information from the tribal perspective is to contact 
              tribal councils for individual tribes - in other words, to consult 
              the people themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#803038">The name Cree was an abbreviated form of 
              Kristinaux, the French version of a Cree name for themselves, Kenistenoag. 
              They were of the Algonquian language family. The Plains Crees were 
              buffalo-hunting people whose range was almost entirely in Canada, 
              north of the Assiniboins and the Sioux. Clark's statement that they 
              &quot;Speak the Chippewa&quot; refered to the Chippewas, or Ojibways, 
              who also spoke an Algonquian tongue. The Crees were important trading 
              partners with the French and later the British in Canada. The adoption 
              Clark refers to was apparently to insure good treatment of the visitors 
              during trading. The Crees live in several Canadian provinces today 
              and also share a reservation in Montana with the Chippewas.</font></p>

              14th of November, Wednesday 1804<br>
              Only two Indians visited us today owing to a dance at the village 
              last night in concluding a ceremony of adoption, and interchange 
              of property, between the Assiniboins, and the nations of this neighborhood. 
              Our interpreter [Jusseaume] informs that 70 lodges, one of 3 bands 
              of Assiniboins &amp; some Christinoes are at the Mandan Village. 
              The Christinoes are about 300 men speak the Chippewa Language. They 
              live near Fort Des Prairies.</font></p>
