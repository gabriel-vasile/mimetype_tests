<P ALIGN="justify">The origins of most living organisms are lost in
antiquity, lost in strata of ancient rocks buried in deep and
inaccessible places; obscure and small beginnings therefore have escaped
discovery. The paleontological record of the sequoia line stretches back
perhaps 150 million years to the Jurassic period. Conifers which were
probably ancestral to these ancient sequoias are found as early as the
Devonian, some 300 million years ago.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The two closest living generic relatives of
<I>Sequoiadendron</I> are <I>Sequoia</I> (coast redwood) and
<I>Metasequoia</I> (dawn redwood) (Stebbins 1948). These trees have a
history in the rocks much like that of the giant sequoia. All three
probably had a common ancestor. Fossil evidence shows that the genus
<I>Sequoia</I> occurred in most regions of the Northern Hemisphere and,
interestingly, also at the extreme south of the Southern Hemisphere.
There are fossil records from Chile, southern Australia and Antarctica.
According to Martin (1957), continental drift explains this
unique distribution. Now increasingly accepted by geologists, this
hypothesis would explain the present wide separation between known
<I>Sequoia</I> fossils. The alternate hypothesis is that ancestral
sequoias migrated southward to reach the continents' southern tips
(Berry 1924). As the rocks in between have no fossil evidence supporting
this idea, continental drift is a most plausible possibility. It
too, however, raises some difficult questions, because the continents
apparently started to drift apart in the early Mesozoic, long before the
first sequoia-like fossils appear (Dietz and Holden 1970). Recent
evidence (Emberger 1968) indicating that the South American fossils are
<I>Taxodium</I> and not <I>Sequoia</I> would eliminate the
controversy.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><I>Metasequoia</I> fossils found in rock formations
throughout the Northern Hemisphere begin with the Cretaceous, about 125
million years ago (Emberger 1968). During the Eocene, some 40-60 million
years ago, these trees, along with <I>Sequoia,</I> grew in the region
that is now Yellowstone National Park. At Amethyst Cliff there are
remains of 18 successive forests, each killed and buried in turn by
volcanic materials (Dunbar 1960). These are spectacular remains, for
many stumps still stand erect, and one diameter measures some 14 ft. By
Pliocene time, <I>Metasequoia</I> was restricted to the Asian
subcontinent and now lives only as a relict species in central China.
For many years the fossil remains of this genus were mistakenly
identified as either <I>Taxodium</I> or <I>Sequoia,</I> until discovery
of the living <I>Metasequoia</I> resolved the confusion (Chaney
1951).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The earliest close relatives of the giant sequoia
were probably <I>Sequoia reichenbachii</I> and <I>Sequoia couttsiae,</I>
which appear as fossils through much of the Northern Hemisphere in
Cretaceous and Tertiary age rocks. They are present in Greenland,
Alaska, Canada, and England (Chaney 1951). Although no doubt they are
related to the giant sequoia, their morphology differs sufficiently to
show that they are not its immediate ancestors (Axelrod 1959). The
oldest fossil sequoia considered directly ancestral to the living giant
sequoia, in Idaho, is from the Miocene. This species not only closely
resembles our giant sequoia but was associated, according to the fossil
records, with plants not easily distinguishable from those of present
sequoia communities (Axelrod 1962, 1964).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The most recently discovered North American fossil in
presumed direct lineage with the giant sequoia is at Trapper Creek in
southern Idaho. These remains show that it grew some 400 miles northeast
of the present groves on the Sierra Nevada's western slope in California
(Axelrod 1964). The species is called <I>Sequoiadendron chaneyi.</I>
Other finds of this fossil in western Nevada bring the giant sequoia's
ancient range closer to its present one. Some four known localities are
within a radius of about 100 miles not far southeast of Reno.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Only a few million years ago the giant sequoia was on
the east side of the Sierra and probably was growing at an altitude of
about 3000 ft (Axelrod 1959). How did it cross the Sierra, and which
natural forces enabled it to do so? What possible geologic and climatic
forces split the groves into their widely spaced northern elements, yet
left the southern belt more or less continuous? These are the major
questions raised by the giant sequoia's relatively recent history.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This fossil form of sequoia, ascribed to the same
genus as our present giant sequoia, is therefore regarded as its closest
ancestral form. It occurred in western North America and reportedly also
in Europe, where it existed as late as the Pleistocene Martin (1957).
We will discuss primarily its migration from the more central
continental United States to its present range in California.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Plant forms of ancient fossil communities compared
with those in their modern counterparts indicate that they occupied
similar environments. We can interpret the association of certain fossil
plants with <I>Sequoiadendron chaneyi</I> remains as representing a
low-elevation, relatively moist community. The Idaho community in part,
consisted of maple, dogwood, oaks, and Douglas fir much like Present
closely related species. Axelrod (1964) has suggested that the annual
precipitation was 45-50 inches and was well distributed throughout the
year. Temperatures were probably moderate in the summer and cool during
the winter. Overall, the climate was temperate in
contrast with today's.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The two important climatic changes concurrent with
the Sierra's rise were the reduced summer precipitation and the
increased range of annual temperature. These apparently preceded the
rise of the Sierra sufficiently to force further evolution of the
ancestral giant sequoia while it migrated in a southwesterly direction.
Increasingly severe winter temperatures would favor the southward
migration, while diminishing summer rains would also favor the westward
migration toward the Sierra Nevada. If this general movement to the
southwest occurred during the Pliocene, it would have allowed the giant
sequoia ample time to reach the Sierra's eastern margin long before that
mountain range began rising to its present heights of more than 14,000
ft.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The giant sequoia's passage across the Sierra Nevada
was probably not over an isolated single route, but possibly via several
low passes serving as access routes to the west. The present groves'
proclivity to extend both up and down stream courses strengthens this
belief. If true, the foregoing might help explain the disjunct or
disrupted distribution of the present sequoia groves. It is still
uncertain, although frequently assumed, that formerly a continuous belt
of this species existed in the Sierra Nevada. Comparing the known
localities of the fossil giant sequoia in Nevada, and considering the
position of the groves on the Sierra Nevada's west slope, we can
visualize the possibility that they may always have existed in a
disjunct pattern (Fig. 27).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Almost since the giant sequoia's discovery, many
different explanations were offered for its greatly restricted and
interrupted range. The disadvantage of early observations was that only
about a dozen groves had been discovered at the time. The larger and
better-known groves were often the ones in the seemingly better sites,
while some of the groves discovered at later dates were smaller and
often removed from the normal courses of human travel. Undoubtedly, the
marginal environmental requirements of these groves should supply the
reason for the disjunct range of the species. The last of the groves was
discovered in 1933.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There are now 75 named community units known as
"groves" in which the giant sequoia is but one member. These groves,
listed in Appendix VI, are taken from Rundel (1969). The land comprising
these groves is an area of some 35,607 acres (State of California 1952).
In none of them does this species grow in a pure stand, although in
certain limited localities it is overwhelmingly predominent. Such areas
as the Senate and House Groups in the Giant Forest and the Sugar Bowl in
the Redwood Mountain Grove of Kings Canyon National Park are always
popular with the park visitor because they are nearly pure stands
(Fig. 28).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The term "grove" is still inadequately defined for
geographic delineation. Guidelines should be adopted and the necessary
changes in geographic place names should be made to eliminate confusion
over multiple groves with a single name, and multiple names for what is
really a single grove. For instance, we logically use one name, the
Redwood Meadow Groves, to designate four separate
units of sequoia trees in the Redwood Meadow area of
Sequoia National Park. They are all in the same drainage and in close
proximity. In Sequoia National Forest, three grove names are assigned to
one unit of contiguous sequoia trees. This is also true in Kings Canyon
National Park, where lobes of the large Redwood Mountain Grove are named
Buena Vista Grove and Big Baldy Grove, although they are nowhere
detached from it and are all in the Redwood Creek drainage system. We
recommend that the Redwood Mountain Grove designation include the
smaller segments. Where two groves spill over a drainage divide as a
narrow belt that widens out with decreasing altitude, they often bear
separate names despite their continuity. The Garfield and Dillonwood
groves are good examples of this dichotomy, but apparently cause less
confusion because two separate drainages are involved. In the Sierra
Nevada, the individual groves are scattered over a 260-mile narrow belt
nowhere more than about 15 miles wide, and generally less. The range is
from 35&000;deg51' N to 39&deg;03' N and is restricted to the western slope at
elevations averaging about 5000-7500 ft, depending upon the latitude,
direction of exposure, position on the slope, and proximity to
subsurface moisture (Blick 1963). The map of grove distribution (Fig.
26) suggests clearly what many people postulated earlier, that the
severe winter climate at the higher elevations and at its northern
limits on the one hand, and the aridity at the lower elevations and at
its southern limits on the other, acted to limit the distribution of
this species (Wilson 1928). Its narrow, discontinuous form alone
suggests, moreover, that the species possesses a narrow tolerance range
during the period of regeneration. Before this aspect was clarified in
relatively recent times, Blick (1963) felt that there must be climatic
unity throughout its range, at least within the groves' restricted areas
and the few isolated individual situations where sequoias are found. His
assumption is undoubtedly rather close to the truth, although climatic
data from the various groves are few indeed. Muir (1878), Wulff et al.
(1911), and Shinn (1889), among others, have also based seemingly
accurate analyses of the disjunct range on climatically regulated
factors, but in very broad generalities without considering the stage of
sequoian life cycle in which the limiting factors are strongest.
Sequoias have been so well planted and cared for outside their natural
range that, once beyond youth, their future is pretty well assured.
Irrigation of many of these specimens, however, introduces an artificial
factor that negates their comparison with trees occurring as natural
populations. The reproductive stage of most organisms is usually the
most vulnerable, and so it is with the giant sequoia. We will discuss
this later in some detail under the Life History of the Giant
Sequoia.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The cause or causes for the very wide gaps between
the northern populations will probably never be completely explained.
Despite their discontinuity the groves as a whole are distributed in the
form of an elongate, narrow belt which suggests strongly that at some
time in the past, possibly during both pre- and Post-glacial times, the
groves may have been more continuous than they are now. But field
evidence of their former occurrence in the present gaps is lacking. John
Muir was the first to note that there were no sequoia-wood remnants to
be found anywhere between the groves, an observation which is valid
today. Groves probably became isolated long ago, because phenotypic
(appearance) attributes peculiar to individual groves suggest that
mutations have occurred following isolation. A good example is the bark's spiral growth
pattern common to many specimens of the Mountain Home Grove (Fig.
13).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Three main hypotheses have been offered to explain
the great isolation of the northern groves: (1) that seeds by fortuitous
dispersal reached distant favorable terrain and there established new
populations; (2) that slow climatic changes narrowed and ultimately
disjoined a once more continuous range; or (3) that there were several
migrational routes across the Sierra Nevada. The latter seems more
logical for a species whose seed dispersal pattern, under normal
circumstances, is usually not much more than twice the height of the tree. But
even the rationale of these hypotheses poses difficult questions when we
consider that the northernmost Placer County Grove is farther than 60
air miles from its nearest neighbors, the Calaveras Groves, and that it
had only six living sequoias when discovered. There are also two downed
sequoia logs in this grove, but they offer little clue to its survival
pattern throughout Pleistocene and Recent times. The total lack of
natural sequoia reproduction there suggested that the range was indeed
being pinched out at the northern end, and most observers offered the
frigid winter climate as the prevailing reason. Yet, temperature
measurements there by a maximum-minimum thermometer indicate that winter
lows are about the same as in the southernmost Deer Creek Grove. Perhaps
environmental conditions, inadequate for a long period, provided limited
reproduction and seedling survival. This grove is well advanced in plant
succession, a result of prolonged absence of fire or other disturbances.
Whereas the almost total lack of downed sequoia trees apparently
contradicts this assertion, the relative lack of fire may best explain
the existence of this small remnant population.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Wulff et al. (1911) suggest that the cooler climate
of the Pleistocene Epoch may even have reduced grove populations to a
single tree, which could have served as a nucleus for the present
groves. The observations of several early workers may yet lead toward a
plausible hypothesis, especially if the results of studies by Rundel
(1969) support them.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Of paramount importance is the availability of
sufficient soil moisture during the sequoia's growing season, a function
of both precipitation patterns and soil texture, which Barry accurately
identified in 1855 as mostly sandy loam. Donaghey (1969) recently
indicated a new factor in soil-moisture relationships; the heat from
wildfires destroys soil organic compounds and causes wetabiliity of the
soil.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">John Muir was perhaps the first writer to single out
the role of soil moisture. He found that medium soil moisture is optimal
for sequoia growth.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">The sequoia is never found in any valley exposed to
the rush of floods, nor on any hillside so steep and unporous as to shed
its soil and rain. It grows always where the deep sandy or loamy soil is
capable of holding the winter moisture all the year, or where the rock
is full of innumerable fissures and is shaded and cool and moist" (Wolfe
1938).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Even though he failed to indicate the necessity of
sunlight for seedling development, his assumptions are essentially
correct, and many writers have repeated them in modified ways.
Invariably, these modifications involve the effect of climatic
differences, soil type, depth of organic layer, leaf litter, shading,
etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Recent investigations, curiously, do not bear out the
belief that rich, deep soils are a necessity for sequoia growth.
Observers have tended to compare forest soils to agricultural soils.
While crop plants need nutritionally rich as well as moist soils, trees
depend mainly upon available soil moisture. The grayish podzolic soils
of the Sierra are less than impressive to the serious farmer.
Furthermore, many people tend to grossly underestimate the complexity of
soils. By and large, Sierran podzolic soils are relatively thin and not
abundantly nutritious. With clay a minimal soil constituent, the total
moisture-holding capacity of these soils is limited by the amount and
distribution of precipitation, subsequent density of vegetation,
temperature and relative humidity during the growing season, and the
wetability factor of the soil. Sequoias show a strong tendency to favor
drainageways where the requisite degree of moisture content is constant.
Yet the drier slopes also support sequoia growth wherever the trees can
become established (Wulff et al. 1911). Contrary to popular belief,
then, soil depth and richness are clearly secondary to soil moisture
availability. Sequoia distribution within groves strongly reflects its
affinity for soil moisture; a crown that may weigh a ton or more seems
to demand it.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Muir (1911, 191 2) was a proponent of the thought
that sequoias created their own moist environment.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">It is a mistake to suppose that water is the cause of
the groves being there. On the contrary, the groves are the cause of the water being
there. The roots of the Big Trees fill the ground forming a sponge which holds the
water. The Big Tree is a tree of life, a never-failing spring all through the hot, rainless
summer. For every grove cut down, a stream is dried up.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Perhaps Muir failed to understand the magnitude of
transpiration, i.e., the vegetation "pumping" soil moisture back into
the atmosphere. It is true that forest vegetation regulates the yearly
flow of water, thus modifying the distribution of runoff and moderating
the extremes. Forest trees play an important role in cycling water from
the ground back into the atmosphere. Removal of the transpirational
pumps, namely, the trees, has often converted a dry forest into a
swamp.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The patterns of growth- and site-selectivity all
bespeak the species' affinity for high soil moisture and reflect the
effect of temperature and relative humidity perhaps more than does
precipitation alone. The ratio of evaporation potential to precipitation
as an environmental factor is important, and its recognition has
produced the widespread belief that the sequoia grows best in protected
locations where the average annual precipitation is from 45 to 60 inches
(Schubert 1952).</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Rundel (1969) amplified this interpretation somewhat.
He found that sequoia stands on northerly slopes have greater density
than on slopes of other aspects, although the total number is generally
less. It is perhaps perplexing that these trees, admittedly with an
affinity for abundant soil moisture, are much more numerous on westerly
and southwesterly slopes, which are potentially the drier ones because
of the sun's more nearly direct rays. Thus, for example, relatively
moist drainage bottoms and meadow margins, although small in their total
acreage, support dense stands of sequoias. Even rocky slopes support
some 3% of the total sequoia population in the Giant Forest. Contrary to
the records of John Muir, large specimens are fairly common on
slopes exceeding 30&deg; and we find some on slopes approaching
45&deg;. We conclude that, regardless of a grove's geographical position,
this species favors avenues of surface or subsurface drainage. Although
surface drainage patterns are obvious, subsurface drainage may be too
obscure for visual identification. The Grizzly Giant in Yosemite's
Mariposa Grove, a good example, grows on a low ridge which appears well
drained, but an apparently abundant subsurface flow of soil water is
undoubtedly a major reason for the tree's great size.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Evaporation potential is partly a function of
temperature. Since temperature decreases with increasing latitude,
average temperatures in the north are the same as at higher elevations
in the south. Thus, the mean altitude of sequoia groves in the Kaweah
Basin to the south is 6600 ft, whereas it is 5400 ft in the northernmost
grove. In the northern groves sequoias are found mostly on south-facing
slopes; in the southernmost, on north-facing ones. Altitude and
direction of slope, then, indirectly reduce water loss from the trees
while maintaining an optimum temperature regime for growth.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The stream drainage channels are also channels of
cold air drainage, especially if they descend from high mountain peaks,
so that the value of available moisture must be pitted against the
limitations of winter survival when temperatures may drop to
sub-survival values. The same drainage channels, however, transport
cones and seeds that are carried downslope where grove extensions form
long, narrow fingers and occasional detached outliers.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In the Mariposa Grove, flooding, not too many years
ago, carried seeds along a tributary of Rattlesnake Creek, and today
there are numerous thriving young sequoias mostly at high flood level on
either side of the creek. No parent trees grow above them, although some
are so close to the drainage divide that chickarees might have carried
the cones into the other drainage basin to eat them.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Perhaps the best-known and most classical grove
extension is along the South Fork of the Kaweah River below the Garfield
Grove. A dozen sequoias line the river bank at elevations as low as 2800
ft&#151;one specimen growing on a gravel bar in the river channel, a
most unlikely site (Fig. 29). The altitude is the lowest known in the
world for a naturally seeded giant sequoia. An increment boring
indicates that this tree was seeded in the middle 1880s, when a
torrential flood also floated huge sequoia logs through the town of
Visalia some 40 miles to the west in the San Joaquin Valley.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Muir (1911, 1912) first explained the sequoia groves'
disjunct distribution as the result of glacial ice flowing through the
canyons and completely destroying the trees and their habitats there.
Muir had overestimated the Pleistocene glaciers' extent in the Sierra,
so that today his hypothesis is largely discounted. He had based it on
the finding that, in the more southerly part of the range, the groves
are in pairs separated by drainageways. Yet none of these pairs is
separated by a drainage which contained glacial ice during the
Pleistocene Epoch. If the ice age were an influence, it is more likely
that cold air drainage down some of the longer canyons was a strong
influence in separating the trees into groves. Although three of the
groves are growing on glacial outwash, none is recorded on glacial
till.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">We know little of how winter cold affects sequoia
distribution. While the tree is not nearly as frost-hardy as other tree species
associated with it, this seems to pose little problem for it within its
native range. Winter temperatures in the groves seldom reach
0&deg;F and when such lows do occur, deep snow usually covers
and protects the tender young seedlings. Temperatures in the intervening
drainageways often fall to zero and below, especially when the stream's
headwaters are on the slopes of high mountain peaks. The confusing part
of the temperature relationship is that specimens planted in the eastern
part of the United States are severely frost-bitten or killed by
temperatures no lower than -15&deg;F Yet, in Europe, specimens not
only have survived this temperature, but are surviving in Poland,
Austria, and Hungary where it has dipped to as low as
-32&deg;F Possibly the differences between the two
continents lie in the soil's condition at time of death. In the Sierra,
generally at least 3-6 ft of snow, and occasionally much more, protect
the soil. Schubert (1957) records snow 29 ft deep in the Giant Forest
during the winter of 1905-06, with isolated drifts still 12 ft deep in
the early part of summer.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Soil type is probably less a controlling factor in
the present distribution of sequoia groves than many earlier writers
realized. Sequoia groves are mostly on granite-based residual and
alluvial soils. Three groves are on glacial outwash, one is on
metamorphosed basalt, and parts of others are on soils derived from
schistose rock. Soil texture, however, does not vary much. Soils,
generally very sandy, are low in their clay fraction, which nevertheless
plays the most significant role in nutriment retention. Furthermore, we
should point out that sequoias cultivated in various parts of the world
are growing vigorously in clays, gravels, peaty soils, and even alkaline
desert soils in Spain, all drastically different from soil types in
their native Sierra Nevada. Soil type alone apparently has insignificant
influence on the distribution of these trees.</P>

<P><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Soil moisture availability</I></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Although soil moisture availability has long been
thought to play a significant role in the natural distribution of giant
sequoias, it remained for Rundel (1969, 1971) to refine and amplify this
broad hypothesis into a more meaningful explanation. In study transects
which crossed grove boundaries, he obtained substantial proof that soil
moisture was more available within the perimeter of the grove than
outside, and that often the difference was marked. He used an
experimental device known as a pressure bomb to measure moisture stress
in the xylem tissues of sequoias and other trees and found convincing
evidence that the stress was much greater outside the groves than in
trees within the groves. The sensitivity of the sequoia seedling to
moisture availability will be further discussed in the section of the
species' life history.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Having identified moisture stress as the major
limiting factor in sequoia distribution, Rundel delved into the
post-Pleistocene climatic changes that may have influenced the present
fragmented distribution of groves. There is good evidence that
approximately 8000 years ago the climate of the earth began to warm,
making the Sierra Nevada drier than it had ever been. Rundel called this
the "Altithermal Period." He postulates that with increasing soil
moisture stress, reproductive success declined, the old trees died and
fell, and new ones either were not forthcoming or else grew in insufficient
numbers to maintain the former extent of the stands. With this trend,
their range of distribution shrank and the drier ridges and slopes
became untenable for sequoia existence. Thus the process of
fragmentation into the mesic sites which are the present groves was
intensified, especially in the southern part of the range.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The implications of his altithermal hypothesis led
Rundel to still another study, which strengthens his contentions. He
notes a great diversity in sequoia age-class distribution among groves,
some groves comprising all age classes and a few being almost devoid of
the younger trees. These various age-class distributions reflect a
continuum of progressive development for sequoia which Rundel divides
into four sequential stages and designates as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">1. The adolescent stage, or one in which trees of
younger age classes are abundant.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">2. The mature, steady-state stage, or one in which a
wide range of age groups is well represented and in which the population
size and age distribution are likely to remain static.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">3. The senescent state, or one in which the
population size is expected to dwindle for lack of replacement
stock.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">4. The decadent stage, or one in which only older
individuals remain.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Without the benefit of Rundel's groupings and
terminology, Aley (1963) predicted that, barring environmental changes
over time, some groves will disappear.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As warming trends create increasingly xeric
conditions, the isolated "islands" of sequoias that were trapped in the
slightly less mesic sites were seriously threatened. Moisture stress,
which seems to become critical within a rather narrow tolerance range,
will probably tip the scales against both germination and seedling
success if warming trends recur.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Certainly the term "senescent" does not apply to
existing trees which are producing cones and viable seeds at the normal
rates.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The above might well lead to the assumption, which
Rundel verifies, that the adolescent stages are rare at present. Mature,
steady-state groves, however, do occur&#151;for example, in the large
Giant Forest and the Redwood Mountain Grove. On the other hand, the
groves in general may be regarded as senescent. They are apparently
unable to maintain their present proportionate number of larger
specimens. Muir Grove (Sequoia National Park) and South Calaveras Grove
are good examples of the senescent stage.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Groves in the decadent stage are few, small, and
rather isolated. Rundel cites the Powderhorn Grove as the prime example
in which reproduction is virtually nonexistent and where only 10% of the
population falls within the 1 to 5-foot-diameter class. In these
circumstances, without factors favorable for regeneration, the giant
sequoias constituting this grove will probably disappear, however slowly.</P>

<P><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Stability of groves</I></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Rundel's altithermal hypothesis seems to support the
long-held and widespread belief that the giant sequoia not only has
stagnated, but is headed for extinction. However, not all grove
boundaries are static or shrinking; some are measurably expanding,
though slowly. This is evident in the Lost Grove, in parts of the Muir
Grove, the Giant Forest, and in South Calaveras Grove. In the Lost
Grove, the uppermost trees on the slopes are considerably smaller and
younger than the next adjacent trees below them. Increment borings in
several of the trees yield growth patterns clearly showing that the
smaller, younger trees began their growth at a time corresponding to a
growth-release pattern shown in the larger and older adjacent trees
downslope. This correspondence very likely represents the occurrence of
a fire, probably in 1872 or 1873, according to release patterns from the
older trees. The younger trees are more than 100 ft up-slope from the
larger specimens which perhaps supplied the seeds. Because the Lost
Grove is a small one, its percent of expansion is fairly large.
Although this expansion has not been well studied, we find similar
evidence in the other groves mentioned above. The percentage of
additions to these much larger groves would, of course, be less.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The future of sequoia's total range will depend,
then, upon climate and modifications by fire and other disturbances. If
warming and drying should resume, however, most certainly grove
perimeters will shrink and the total population of giant sequoias will
be reduced.</P>

<P><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Sequoias elsewhere</I></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">With the giant sequoia's discovery, it was to be
expected that people would want to grow specimens in their yards,
gardens, and public parks for ornamentation and as scientific
curiosities. This horticulture began just a year after Dowd discovered
the Calaveras Grove when a John D. Matthew sent a packet of seeds to his
father at Gourdie Hill, near Perth, in Scotland. The seeds arrived there
on 28 August 1853, the first to be shipped from the New World, and they
were quickly planted. Other seeds and seedlings arrived in Europe the
same year. Many of the seeds had been collected from the "Mother of the
Forest" in the Calaveras Grove following that tree's unfortunate
divestment of bark.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The British, with their characteristic fervor for
gardening, raised many of the seedlings in their nurseries. At the
outset, one-year seedlings sold in England brought the handsome price of
&pound;10 each (about $50 at the 1850 exchange rate), so that for a time
their use was rather restricted to the wealthy for planting on the
larger estates. Saunders (1926) stated that no other species of tree
ever introduced into England had caused such excitement or had been so
costly. Today, Alan Mitchell of the Royal Forestry Commission makes the
statement (pers. comm.) that there is scarcely a hilltop or mountain
peak in Great Britain from which a sequoia cannot be seen. They grow
rapidly in that country, especially in the more humid regions of
Scotland. A handsome specimen of some
8.5 ft dbh and 150 ft tall, the largest tree in all
Great Britain, grows at Leod Castle north of Inverness.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It is estimated that in Europe there are perhaps as
many as 10,000 sequoia trees. They are abundant in France, Germany,
Switzerland, and the Low Countries, and easily identified as the tallest trees
projecting themselves above the general tree-crown canopy. The most northerly are
in coastal Norway, where the Gulf Stream lowers winter temperatures and cold
climate is not a limiting factor. On the north shore of the spectacular Sogne
Fj&ouml;rd, in the yard of an ancient church in the town of Leikanger, at 61&deg; 11'
N latitude is the northernmost specimen. Planted in the 1880s, it is now
nearly 4.5 ft in diameter.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Progressing south and east across Europe, sequoias
are increasingly fewer. Yet they grow well in Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria, and along the Black Sea Coast of the USSR. They
appear to be limited by continental cold air masses in Poland, northern
USSR, Finland, and Sweden. Of the several that were introduced into
Poland, only one has survived the frigid winter weather, a specimen
growing near the city of Szezecin in the western part of the
country.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In southern Europe, the seasonally arid Mediterranean
climate inhibits growth unless summer watering is provided. Although
there are several specimens in Yugoslavia, Italy, and Spain, the trees
have not survived climatic conditions in Greece and Albania. In southern
France, specimens are found more commonly at higher elevations where
more mesic conditions prevail. By far the largest specimens in all of
Europe are those in the palace grounds at La Granja, Spain, northwest of
Madrid. In a warm climate and with regular lawn watering, the larger
specimen is 13 ft dbh and 130 ft tall, while the smaller of the two is
more than 10 ft dbh and 133 ft tall (Fig. 30). These two specimens were
planted in the late 1800s. Because they grow in the open, they have
retained their branches down to the ground and display a form that is
rarely seen in its native habitat.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Specimens are also known to be growing in Turkey,
Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, Cyprus, Japan, South America, Australia, New
Zealand, and in British Columbia, Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere,
they seem to be indifferent to the reversal of the seasons and grow
vigorously, particularly in New Zealand.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The sequoia's successful existence in such diverse
and widely scattered environments abroad has provoked many to ask why
its natural range is so restricted. This logical question fails to take
into account its nurture by man and the fact that nowhere outside of its
native Sierra Nevada has the giant sequoia ever been known to re-seed
itself by natural means. Yet even in the Sierra, wherever the necessary
conditions for natural re-seeding are fulfilled, the early seedling
stage is always the most vulnerable to environmental vicissitudes.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">However unique the ecological relationships within
the perimeters of extant sequoia groves, probably the only plant
exclusively found in these groves is the giant sequoia itself, and even
the combinations of plants and animals associated with it vary from
grove to grove, resulting in different biotic interrelations. We will
treat this complex subject in more detail later.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But first, what is ecology? What major ecological
principles apply to the life of this fascinating tree?</P>
