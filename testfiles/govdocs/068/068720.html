<P><i>John Baumgardner, Los Alamos National Laboratory</i><BR>			&nbsp;

<P>Following the Round Two site visit held at UCLA in April 1996, an effort
was launched to improve the performance of TERRA on the expected Round
Two initial hardware, the Cray T3D. TERRA had been originally developed
on and highly optimized for the Cray vector XMP and YMP machines. This
effort focused on optimizing instead for the cache-based superscalar architecture
of the T3D Dec Alpha processors. It involved primarily increasing the reuse
of data in the very small cache on these processors. A large fraction of
the arithmetic operations in TERRA involve application of 21-point stencils
on a logically regular mesh. This character of the numerical algorithms
provides the potential of significant data reuse, since field values at
a given grid point are used several times as a stencil operator is applied
at neighboring grid points.
<P>The main strategy for achieving improved data reuse involved breaking
single loops that swept over two spatial dimensions into two shorter loops
that each sweep over a single spatial dimension. Whereas the T3D processor
cache generally was too small to hold the two-dimensional arrays required
for high reuse, it was found to be large enough for the smaller one-dimensional
arrays. This strategy improved the per processor performance on the main
kernels in TERRA from about 12 Mflops to the range of 35-40 Mflops -- approximately
a three-fold increase. It required, however, a rewrite of all the important
kernels in the code.
<P>John Baumgardner at Los Alamos accomplished this work mostly during
the month of May 1996 in collaboration with Mark Dalton of Cray Research
at Los Alamos and Maynard Brandt in the Benchmark Services group at Cray
Research in Eagan, Minnesota. In addition, Maynard Brandt rewrote the communication
module to use T3D shmem routines in place of PVM library routines. The
latter resulted in a two-fold reduction in the time spent in inter-process
communication, such that it constituted only about six percent of the total.
<P>Maynard Brandt at Cray Research made a quantitative measure of TERRA
performance after these improvements. The test problem was a non-trivial
one involving a fully 3-D temperature-dependent viscosity model using 16
T3D processors and a grid subdomain size identical to that planned for
the 512 processor benchmark. From the CPU time and the number of floating
point operations as determined by Apprentice, Brandt in early June 1996
obtained a TERRA performance of 22.0 Mflops/processor. This performance
projected to a total of 11.24 Gflops on 512 T3D processors and indicated
that TERRA's raw performance was now sufficient to achieve the first performance
milestone of 10 Gflops.
<P>The next hurdle was to remove a limitation in TERRA that restricted
the number of processes to a power of four (i.e., 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, ...)
such that, instead, any power of two (in particular, 9, corresponding to
512 processors) was possible. This involved modifying the manner in which
domain decomposition was done and therefore also many of the details of
the interprocess communication. It required generalization of all the communications
routines to accommodate a variable number (either five or ten) of blocks
of grid points per processor. (There are ten logically square blocks of
grid points that fit together to cover the spherical surface in the icosahedral
grid used in TERRA.)
<P>A second similar hurdle was to eliminate a piece of serial coding at
the lowest levels of the multigrid solver. This task involved mapping the
multigrid calculations at the lowest grid levels, rather than to a single
processor as had been done previously, instead, to one-fourth of the remaining
active processors. This strategy allows the work at these lowest grid levels
to be done in parallel instead of serially. But it required writing new
communication routines to handle the new communication patterns as well
as major modification of the data structures at these lower grid levels.
<P>Both these tasks were completed by mid-January, 1997. Shortly thereafter
TERRA met the 10 Gflops milestone with a performance of 11.6 Gflops on
the NASA Goddard 512 processor Cray T3D. Speed per processor was found
to be constant within about one percent for configurations of 16 to 512
processors when the total problem size was scaled to give roughly the same
per processor work. This implied excellent parallel scaling.
<P>With the arrival of the Cray T3E at NASA Goddard in the spring of 1997,
effort was focused on optimizing the code for that platform. The most significant
issue was making use of the new T3E hardware stream buffers that allowed
more efficient transfer of data from main memory to secondary cache. Unfortunately,
there was a design error in the boards that used the 300 MHz EV5 Alpha
chip that could cause a system crash when the stream buffers were utilized.
To work around this problem it was necessary initially to use versions
of the communication routines based on MPI rather than shmem. Spencer Swift
of Cray Research/SGI at NASA Goddard provided considerable help working
through these difficulties as well as in modifying the kernel routines
to achieve improved utilization of the stream buffers. With stream buffers
activated, TERRA performance exceeded what was required to meet the 50
Gflops milestone by a comfortable margin.
<P>In early August 1997 a performance of 38.0 Gflops was measured on the
512 PE 300 MHz T3E (T3E-600) at NASA Goddard (considered by NASA to represent
half the resources required for the 50 Gflops milestone). At about the
same time a performance of 86.8 Gflops was measured on a 1024 PE 450 MHz
T3E (T3E-900) at Eagan, Minnesota (considered by NASA to represent 1.5
times the resources required for the 50 Gflops milestone). In the first
case the performance was 38.0/25.0 = 1.52 times the milestone requirement,
and in the second it was 86.8/75.0 = 1.16 times the requirement. In regard
to the latter case, it is to be noted that although the peak processor
speed of the T3D-900 exceeded that of the T3E-600 by 50%, the bandwidth
to main memory was identical for both systems. Since the TERRA performance
is limited mostly by memory bandwidth, it is understandable why its performance
did not scale simply with peak processor speed. In any case, these performance
numbers were readily satisfied the requirements of the second performance
milestone.
<P>The final performance milestone required that the TERRA calculation
include its particle-based treatment of lithospheric plates. Lithospheric
plates in TERRA are modeled as perfectly rigid patches in the topmost layer
of nodes in the spherical grid. The spatial identity of the plates is carried
by sets of particles, one set for each plate, that are moved in a Lagrangian
manner across the surface. A single Euler rotation vector describes the
motion of each plate. In a dynamical calculation the set of plate rotation
vectors is obtained via a Newton iteration procedure that minimizes the
net torque on each plate. The resulting piecewise uniform surface velocity
field is then applied as a velocity boundary condition in solving the momentum
equation for the velocity field in the interior of the spherical shell
domain. A set of rules is applied at plate boundaries to treat the removal
of particles at zones of convergence and addition of particles and creation
of new plate in zones of divergence.
<P>The particles in this treatment are always stored in memory in locations
corresponding to the nearest grid point. This permits the basic particle
data structure to be identical to that of the other grid based variables
and allows identical domain decomposition and parallelization. It therefore
allows relatively high parallel performance for the particle algorithms.
Indeed we found that adding the particle treatment reduced the overall
performance by only a few percent compared with runs without this treatment.
<P>We achieved the third performance milestone, that of 100 Gflops, in
November 1998 during a window of opportunity when a large Cray T3E-1200
was available at Eagan, Minnesota. TERRA achieved 121.8 Gflops on 1024
processors with the plate treatment included. Table 1 below summarizes
the TERRA performance on three versions of the Cray T3E hardware with processor
clock rates respectively of 300, 450, and 600 Mhz.

</CENTER>		<P><B>Illustrative TERRA Calculation</B>		<P>To illustrate TERRA's present capabilities, we present a model calculation
for the Earth's mantle that exploits TERRA's ability to treat strong local
variations in the strength of silicate rock that arise from variations
in temperature and stress. Including this realism in the silicate deformation
law leads to a remarkably Earth-like solution, with plate-like surface
velocities, an internal density structure with strong harmonic degree two
components, and an amount of toroidal energy in the surface velocity field
similar to that actually observed. This solution varies only slowly with
time after a transient response from an initial state involving high spatial
frequency random temperature perturbations.
<P>Our computational mesh, as displayed in Fig. 1, has 65 layers, with
163,842 grid points each, for a total of 10,649,730 grid points. The horizontal
resolution at the surface is about 60 km. For simplicity in the interpretation
of our results we make the Boussinesq approximation. We assume the spherical
shell is heated only from within. We use Earth-like values for all the
primary physical parameters except for the specific heat, which we lower
by a factor of ten to reduce the Rayleigh number so as to match the resolution
constraints imposed by the available computer resources. We also reduce
by about a factor of five the activation energy in the Newtonian viscosity
because of limitations on the viscosity gradients imposed by our algorithms.
The depth dependence of viscosity, as shown in Fig. 2, is relatively simple.
The upper mantle has a reference value of 2 x 1020 Pa-s, and the top 65
km and depths below 1000 km have reference values 1000 times larger, with
smooth variation in the depth regions 65-250 km and 450-1000 km. We apply
a viscous yield stress of 140 MPa in the top 250 km. The resulting total
viscosity variation is approximately a factor of 200,000.
<P>The calculation is initialized with random temperature variations imposed
on a radial temperature profile that is uniformly 2000 K in the interior
and drops to 300 K through a boundary layer at the surface. The temperature
field initially displays a large number of point like downwellings, but
these tend to coalesce into linear downwelling features which in turn coalesce
to form a single linear network as displayed in Fig. 3(a). The time scale
for this development is about 109 years. Thereafter the pattern retains
its topological character and changes only slowly with time as indicated
in Fig. 3(b). Figures 4 and 5 show the viscosity field with large high
viscosity patches at the surface characterized by low internal rates of
strain. Weak zones that display high rates of deformation and represent
zones of localized downwelling and upwelling surround these platelike patches.
Numerous instances of oblique motion at downwelling zones lead to a toroidal
component of velocity that is 30-35% of the poloidal component in magnitude
at the surface. The geoid is dominated by its harmonic degree two components.
<P>From a scientific standpoint, this solution which displays such remarkable
similarity to the Earth leads us to conclude much of the mantle's unique
behavior and history can be traced directly to a few crucial but simple
aspects of its rheology.
<P>This case was run on 128 processors of the Cray T3E-600 `jsimpson' at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. A typical time step of length 40,000
years required 6.5 seconds of CPU time on 128 processors. This corresponds
to 163 CPU seconds per Myr of problem time or 45 CPU hours per Gyr. Each
time step typically involves four multigrid cycles to solve for 42.6 million
unknowns (three velocity components plus pressure at each grid point) plus
an update of the energy equation. The total execution rate for this case
on the 128 processors of the T3E-600 is approximately 11 Gflops. TERRA
also displays a similar level of performance on current Beowulf clusters
of similar size.

<P>One of the fundamental goals of this project, and of mantle convection
research in general, is to identify&nbsp; a material description which
will allow tectonic plates to form naturally in mantle convection simulations,
rather than being imposed by the modeler as has been necessary in the past.
This should help to answer fundamental&nbsp; questions such as "Why does
the Earth have plate tectonics, whereas Venus and Mars do not". This problem
is particularly challenging in three-dimensional geometry due to the presence
of transform plate boundaries, which do no arise naturally in a convecting
system.
<P>In summer 1997, Tackley obtained for the first time, self-consistently
generated plates&nbsp; in a three-dimensional mantle flow&nbsp; calculation,&nbsp;
work which was subsequently published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
They key component of the material properties&nbsp; was strain-rate weakening,&nbsp;
i.e., decreasing stress with increasing strain rate. Strain-rate weakening
had previously been investigated in a two-dimensional sheet by co-PI Bercovici.
The material and numerical model used for these initial results was quite
simple, and as a result the plates were not fully realistic. In particular,
the calculations considered only the instantaneous flow for a given distribution
of buoyancy&nbsp; forces, rather than being time-dependent, and assumed
a fixed-thickness lithosphere, rather than one which arose due to the temperature-dependence
of viscosity in the cold upper boundar layer .
<P>To overcome these limitations, Tackley developed a rheological parameterization
which combines temperature- depth- stress- and history- dependence. The
history-dependence is described through the time-dependent evolution of
'damage', which weakens the material. Damage arises where material is deformed
at high stress, and heals with time at a rate which is temperature-dependent,
allowing long-term memory at cold, lithospheric temperatures but rapid
healing at hot mantle temperatures. Under steady-state conditions, the
damage evolution reduces to the previously-used strain-rate weaking. This
description was shown to lead to the generation of weak transform margins,
suduction zones and spreading centers in steady-state models in a paper
in press in an AGUGeophysical Monograph volume.
<P>Fully time-dependent, self-consistent models followed in fall 1998,
when Tackley developed the first fully time-dependent, self-consistent
3-D models which develop plate-like behavior evolving continuously in space
and in time. These results were presented at several meetings, and will
be submitted for publication shortly. An illustrative result shown in the
Figure below shows passive rifting, passive oceanic spreading centers,
single-sided subduction, and back-arc spreading , all characteristic features
of Earth's plate tectonics.&nbsp; In these results, the plateness is, to
first order, caused by a pseudo-plastic yield stress rather than strain-weakening
or strain-rate weakening. Having a low-viscosity asthenosphere under the
lithosphere results in sharper plate boundaries but is not necessary for
plates to exist. A systematic investigation of these models is under way.
<P><IMG SRC="PTfig.jpg" HEIGHT=352 WIDTH=764>
<P><b>Figure 6</b>&nbsp; <i>Self-consistent plate generation, including continental plates (single-sided subduction)</i>
<P>		<HR WIDTH="100%">		<P>An important component of Earth's plate tectonics are the compositionally-distinct
continental plate regions. The interaction between buoyant continental
material and mantle flowhas been studied by Tackley and student Li Ma using
three-dimensional simulations with buoyant continental material at the
top. The simulations are distinguished from previous works not only by
dimensionality but also by treating the continents using a self-consistent
rheological description allowing them to deform, break up etc., as opposed
to the traditional 'rigid block' approach. Buoyant continental material
has also been included in the fully self-consistent plate generation models,
as shown above.
<P>Elasticity and related brittle failure are undoubtedly important in
the shallow lithosphere and may be responsible for some of the characteristic
features of plate tectonics and instrumental in the formation of new plate
boundaries. Progress was made by project postoc Moritz Heimpel on the inclusion
of elasticity and brittle failure in the STAG convection code and it is
expected that this will be completed in the near future.

<P><B>Mantle-Core Coupling</B>
<P><b>a)</b> Coupled mantle and core dynamics on Io. Jupiter's moon Io
is a prime example of a body for which mantle-core coupling may play an
important&nbsp; role. Recent measurements by the Galileo spacecraft indicate
that Io has an active component to its magnetic field. Circulation in the
core is probably driven by differential heating and cooling from the mantle.
Io's mantle is particularly interesting, being unique amonst planetary
mantles so far considered because convection is driven by non-uniform tidal
dissipation rather than uniform radiogenic heating or an isothermal hot
lower boundary. Thus, Tackley in collaboration with Schubert and Glatzmaier
have been simulating mantle convection in Io, using the spectral MAN code.
Results to date indicate that the style of convection consistens of a mean
flow driven by the distribution of tidal heating, with small-scale instabilities
superimposed on the mean flow. As Rayleigh number is increased these small-scale
instabilities increasingly distribute the heat, so that the surface distribution
of heat flow is much more uniform than the tidal dissipation distribution
would suggest. Patterns of heat flux across the core-mantle boundary are
being used as a boundary condition for core dyamo simulations by Glatzmaier
and Roberts.
<BR>			&nbsp;
<P><b>b)</b> The core-mantle-boundary region: thermo-chemical convection
calculations with a dense D" layer. The D" region, lying at the base of
the mantle directly above the core, has received a lot of interest and
attention in recent years and is a key area for core-mantle interactions.
One possibility for D" is that it consists of a layer of chemically dense
material. Tackley has performed the first three-dimensional calculations
of mantle convection with a dense layer at the base, in order to characterize
the basic planforms and dynamics. Dense material is swept up into 'piles'
underlying the upwellings, and slowly entrained. Entrainment is always
in cylindrical forms, even in completely internally-heated convection.
If depth-dependent properties (such as viscosity) result in very sluggish
convection in the deep mantle (as indicated by a low 'local' Rayleigh number)
then these piles can be very large, even if the chemical density contrast
is small. These large thermo-chemical piles or 'megaplumes' may provide
an explanation for features seen in seismic tomographic models under Africa
and the Pacific.

Vertical vorticity is&nbsp; a fine-scaled representation of toroidal flow and represents the rate of strike-slip shear between plates as well as plate spin (vorticity is essentially a measure of the local angular velocity, i.e., angular velocity of a point in the fluid). The divergence and vorticity fields shown are estimated directly from a model that uses finite-width plate margins based on seismicity distributions; for the standard plate model with infinitesimall thin margins, these fields are singularities and thus cannot be reliably estimated.</i>		<p></p>		<P><IMG SRC="DBfig2.jpg" HEIGHT=471 WIDTH=682>		<P><b>Figure 8 </b><i>Generation of the Earth's toroidal motion via a source-sink model.
The Earth's horizontal divergence <b>(Fig. a -- top)</b> (a simpler and
smoother version of that shown in the previous figure)&nbsp; is used as&nbsp;
a source-sink field to drive flow in a non-Newtonian thin (lithospheric)
fluid shell.&nbsp; The divergent zones (yellow and red) are used as sources
of material, while the convergent zones (blue) are used as sinks. Ideally,
the interaction of the source-sink&nbsp; field and non-Newtonian rheology
in the lithospheric fluid shell would recover the Earth's vertical vorticity
field (Fig. (a) -- bottom) (again, simpler and smoother than that shown
in \plateref{divvor}). Flow in the models with power-law rheologies do
not generate Earth-like vorticity (<b>Fig. (b) -- top and middle frames</b>)
for power-law indices that are mantle-like, n=3, and extreme, n=21.&nbsp;
Flow with the continuous stick-slip or self-lubricating rheologies (labelled
as n=-1) (<b>Fig. (b</b>) <b>-- bottom</b>) generates a more Earth-like vorticity field.&nbsp; See Bercovici [1995a] for further discussion.</i>		<P>		<P><IMG SRC="DBfig3.jpg" HEIGHT=569 WIDTH=540>		<P><b>Figure 9 </b><i>A simple model of a thin lithospheric-type layer of fluid driven by a basic source-sink field S (top row; yellow and red represent a source of material, blues represent sinks). The viscosity of the fluid layer is variable. In one model the viscosity is a function of temperature Theta and heat is generated by viscous dissipation (middle row showing, left to right, dimensionless horizontal velocity v_h, vertical vorticity or strike-slip shear omega_z [see also Figs 7 and 8], and temperature Theta). In the second model viscosity is a function of volatile (e.g., water) content measured in terms of volume&nbsp; raction of voids or porosity Phi; the voids are generated according to the amount that the fluid is stressed and damaged (bottom row, showing left to right, velocity, vorticity and porosity). The fields S, omega_z, Theta and Phi as shown are multiplied by a factor of 1000. The interaction of the source-sink field and the variable viscosity leads to toroidal flow. Toroidal motion (represented with vertical vorticity) and plate strength&nbsp; or&nbsp; plateness (measured by temperature or porosity distribution, where hot or porous is weak, cold and unporous is strong) remains diffuse and unplate-like in the viscous-heating based mechanism even with very temperature-dependent viscosity. However, toroidal motion in the void-volatile model can allow extremely focussed, nearly fault-like concentrations of strike-slip shear or toroidal motion (bottom middle frame) and plate- ike strength distributions (bottom right frame).

<P>A computer simulation of magnetic field generation by convection in
the Earth's fluid outer core produces a time dependent field that, like
the Earth's, is strongly dipole dominated outside the core and occasionally
undergoes spontaneous dipole reversals.
<P>The 3D spherical model solves the magnetohydrodynamic equations within
the anelastic approximation. Because of limited spatial resolution, the
viscous and thermal diffusivities crudely represent the transport of momentum
and heat by unresolved eddies. An Earth-like heat flux imposed over the
core-mantle boundary (CMB) controls the cooling rate of the core, which
determines the vigor of the convection and intensity of the generated magnetic
field. The Earth's rotation rate is essential for producing the sheared
and helical fluid flows for the dynamo; it is also what makes the numerical
method, which treats the Coriolis force implicitly, so challenging.
<P>The DYNAMO code uses a spectral transform formulation based upon expansion
in&nbsp; spherical harmonics and Chebyshev polynomials.&nbsp; The equations
are integrated forward in time using a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme;
nonlinear terms are treated explicitly and linear terms are treated implicitly.
<P>The high-performance parallel code is based on a message passing paradigm.
In the broadest terms, the parallelization strategy has been to perform
the spectral transforms on data that is ``in processor'' while distributing
the orthogonal directions among the processors in a load-balanced manner.
Global memory transposes are then used to rearrange the data as necessary
for each type of operation. The spectral transforms themselves are highly
efficient operations (in terms of hardware utilization) on virtually all
processors, but particularly so on cache-based hierarchical memory systems
typical of modern parallel computers.
<P>As part of NASA's Earth and Space Science High Performance Computing
Cooperative Agreement, DYNAMO has been highly optimized for the Cray T3E.
The T3E possesses an extremely low-latency, high-bandwidth network which
is ideal for the global memory transposes used in spectral transform methods.
Every effort has been made to maximize cache-reuse, reduce the number of
communication packets, and to exploit the specialized&nbsp; E-registers
for local and remote memory transfers. Because the computational load of
the Legendre transforms is dominant for all but very low resolution cases,
the time spent in transforms also dominates the time spent communicating,
thereby enabling excellent scalability. DYNAMO has run on as many as 1490
processors and attained performance in excess of 600 billion floating point
operations per second (GFLOPS). For moderate grid resolutions suitable
for our current research, DYNAMO&nbsp; typically achieves between 100 and
200 GFLOPS on 512 processors of the T3E.
<P>Several numerical simulations have been obtained with the Glatzmaier-Roberts
model; they span over a million years using a numerical time step of 15
days or less.&nbsp; Here we describe a medium resolution case with 49 radial
levels (plus 17 in the inner core), 144 latitudinal levels, and 144 longitudinal
levels. The magnetic energy, integrated through the core, is more than
three orders of magnitude greater than the kinetic energy of the convection
that maintains it.&nbsp; Maximum magnetic field intensity, in the deep
interior of the core, can be 20 mT and maximum fluid velocity is typically
about a millimeter per second.&nbsp; Although this is much less than, for
example, atmospheric wind speeds, it is a million times greater than mantle
convection.&nbsp; Convection of the dense metallic core fluid is so efficient
that the maximum temperature variation (on a sphere of constant radius)
is only about 0.001K.
<P>Figure 10 shows a typical magnetic energy spectrum (in spherical harmonic degrees) for the field at the CMB for the Earth (out to degree 12) and for the Glatzmaier-Roberts simulation (to degree 95).&nbsp; (The Earth's core field is known only out to degree 12 because the crustal magnetic field significantly interferes for larger degrees.)&nbsp; Both spectra show the dipole (l=1) component dominating.&nbsp; Since the dipole part of the field decreases the least rapidly with distance from the core, the structure appears even more dipole dominated at the Earth's surface as i lustrated in Figure 2 where the radial component of the field is plotted in equal area projections.&nbsp; One can also see in Figure 2 that although including degrees 13 to 95 produces no detectable difference in the surface field, it makes a significant difference in the structure of the field at the CMB.&nbsp; This argues for much more small scale structure in the geomagnetic field at the CMB than is seen in the current degree 12 spectrum of the geomagnetic field. The intense concentrations of magnetic flux (core spots) seen in the simulated field at the CMB are somewhat similar to sun spots on the solar surface.<P><IMG SRC="fig1.gif" HEIGHT=560 WIDTH=552>		<P><b>Figure 10</b> <i>A snapshot of the magnetic energy density at the core-mantle boundary for today's Earth (solid circles, up to degree 12) and for the Glatzmaier-Roberts geodynamo simulation (open circles, up to degree 95).</i>		<P><IMG SRC="fig2.gif" HEIGHT=552 WIDTH=516>		<P><b>Figure 11</b> <i>The radial component of the magnetic field at the surface and at the core-mantle boundary for the Earth (up to degree 12) and for the Glatzmaier-Roberts simulation (up to degree 12 and up to degree 95).

Technical Accomplishments:</B>		<P>In year 3 of the project we created and used a new workstation version
of the DYNAMO code, along with user documentation and a graphical interface.
The workstation version is based on the Boussinesq (incompressible fluid
limit) version of the full code. It uses an improved explicit time step
procedure, in which the Alfven waves in the boundary layers are numerically
damped. This permits longer time steps, and allows for longer simulation
times.&nbsp; The code is readily portable to any workstation or PC running
UNIX or LINUX.&nbsp; The graphical interface is written in IDL (Interactive
Data Language) and can be used on UNIX, Windows, or Mac platforms.
<P><B>II. Scientific Accomplishments: A Systematic Parameter Study of Numerical
Dynamos</B>
<P>We have analyzed about 50 3D numerical dynamos driven by thermal convection
in a rotating spherical shell with the geometry of the Earth's core (Olson,
Christensen and Glatzmaier, 1999; Christensen, Olson and Glatzmaier, 1999).
We examined the influence of rigid versus stress-free boundaries and, by
varying the Ekman, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, different combination
of magnetic, thermal and viscous diffusivities. We find mostly dipole-dominated
dynamo solutions, except at the highest Rayleigh numbers, where the dynamos
are sometimes octupole&nbsp; dominated (see Figure 12 below).&nbsp; When
low-pass filtered to mimic the filtering effect of the mantle on the magnetic
field, several of the models exhibit magnetic field strucutures that resemble
the geomagnetic field at the core-mantle boundary.
