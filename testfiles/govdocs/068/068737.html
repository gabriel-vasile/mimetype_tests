	         <li> Twenty-seven chemicals (including 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene) previously tested in rodent carcinogenicity assays were tested for induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in Chinese hamster ovary cells as part of a larger analysis of the correlation between results of in vitro genetic toxicity assays and carcinogenicity bioassays. Chemicals were tested up to toxic doses with and without exogenous metabolic activation. 3-Chloro-2-methyl-1-propene induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells at 16-200 ug/ml, both in the presence and absence of S9. In the absence of S9, in vitro treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with 120 ug/ml or more of this chemical also produced chromosomal aberrations; treatment results in the presence of S9 were questionable because the increases in aberrations occurred only in one trial at the highest nontoxic dose tested (200 ug/ml), and the aberrations were all observed as pulverized chromosomes.

Survival in the treated groups was not significantly lower than that in vehicle controls; the numbers of survivors at the end of the experiment were: 26 male controls, 37 at the low dose and 32 at the high dose; and 37 female controls, 43 at the low dose and 27 at the high dose. Histopathological evaluation revealed dose-related increased incidences (by the incidental tumor test) of forestomach neoplasms in males and females. In males, the incidences of squamous-cell papillomas were 3/49 controls, 19/49 (p< 0.001) at the low dose and 30/49 (p< 0.001) at the high dose; the incidence of squamous-cell carcinomas were 0/49 controls, 5/49 (p= 0.031) at the low dose and 7/49 (p= 0.016) at the high dose; and the combined incidences of squamous-cell papillomas or carcinomas were 3/49 controls, 24/49 (p< 0.001) at the low dose and 36/49 (p< 0.001) at the high dose. In females, the incidences of squamous-cell papillomas were 0/50 controls, 15/48 (p< 0.001) at the low dose and 29/44 (p< 0.001) at the high dose; the incidences of squamous-cell carcinomas were: 0/50 controls, 1/48 at the low dose and 2/44 at the high dose; and the combined incidences of squamous-cell papillomas or carcinomas were 0/50 controls, 16/48 (p<0.001) at the low dose and 31/44 (p< 0.001) at the high dose.

The compound was extensively absorbed and rapidly excreted: 82% of the single dose was eliminated within 24 hours after treatment. It was rapidly distributed to tissues, and the highest concentrations were found in forestomach, liver and kidney; the concentration of radiolabel was considerably lower in glandular stomach than in forestomach. The tissue concentrations were approximately doubled after two doses, but little additional increase was observed after four doses. The concentrations decreased after cessation of treatment. After a single dose, about 58% of the administered radiolabel was found in the urine, 22% was exhaled and 2% was detected in the feces.

	         <li> Toxicity of 1-chloro-2-methylpropene (CMP) with respect to testicular changes was evaluated in male albino Wistar rats (10/treated group, 20 in arachis oil vehicle control group) exposed orally to CMP by gavage at dosage levels of 0, 40 or 60 mg/kg/day for 14 days. On day 15, the animals were sent for pathological examination. Significant differences were observed between treated and control animals in the following: decreased maternal body weight and body weight gain (high-dose group), increased incidence of minor renal changes (increase in eosinophilic intra-cytoplasmic inclusion droplets in the proximal convoluted tubules, high-dose group), and increased incidence of gastric lesions, severe irritative changes in the stomach, and focal erosion of the cardiac mucosa with moderate hyperkeratosis and acanthosis in the stomach (both treated groups). No significant differences between treated and control animals were observed in the following: maternal mortality, clinical observations, testes weights, morphology, or detailed macroscopic and microscopic examination of the testes, epididymides, ductuli efferentes, and vasa deferentes.[Tunstall Lab, Shell Oil Co.; Toxicity of Fine Chemicals: Preliminary Studies for the Detection of Testicular Changes in Rats.
