 Quick Bibliography SeriesBibliographies in the Quick Bibliography Series of the National
 Agricultural Library, are intended primarily for current awareness,
 and as the title of the series implies, are not indepth exhaustive
 bibliographies on any given subject.  However, the citations are a
 substantial resource for recent investigations on a given topic. 
 They also serve the purpose of bringing the literature of
 agriculture to the interested user who, in many cases, could not
 access it by any other means.  The bibliographies are derived from
 computerized on-line searches of the AGRICOLA data base. 
 Timeliness of topic and evidence of extensive interest are the
 selection criteria.
 
 The author/searcher determines the purpose, length, and search
 strategy of the Quick Bibliography.  Information regarding these is
 available upon request from the author/searcher.
 
 Copies of this bibliography may be made or used for distribution
 without prior approval.  The inclusion or omission of a particular
 publication or citation may not be construed as endorsement or
 disapproval.

 Descriptors: Asparagus; Trichoderma harzianum; Seed germination
 
 Abstract:  Two methods of applying a biocontrol agent (Trichoderma
 harzianum--"T 581") directly to the seed were evaluated in order to
 assess its possible positive effects on germination. The "T 581"
 strain, isolated from the soil and grown on potato dextrose agar
 medium (PDA) for seven days, was employed in three concentrations
 (10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) spores/ml). The following methods were
 evaluated for each concentration: 1. Seed coating using talcum and
 sodium alginate as dispersant and thickening agent for the
 condidial suspension, respectively; 2. Seed coating and
 encapsultation of biocontrol agent using talcum and alginate with
 the addition of a food-base compound (chitin) in case (a) and
 without such addition in case (b). After this, encapsulation of
 Trichoderma was obtained by dropping the coated seeds into 0.1 M
 calcium gluconate solution. The parameters obtained in the trials
 conducted on the "UC 157 LT 869-470-2" asparagus variety were
 germination percentage and amount of dry matter produced by
 seedlings. The results are then discussed.

 Abstract:  This paper examines the effects of Trichoderma harzianum
 Rifai ("T 581") on the germination of asparagus seeds ("UC 157 LT
 869-470-2" variety) when added to the soil. The "T 581" strain
 grown on potato dextrose agar medium (PDA) for seven days was
 brought to a 10(5) spores/ml concentration and employed in two
 formulations: liquid and solid. The biocontrol agent was added at
 a ratio of 26 000 spores/g to thhe soil which had previously been
 steam-sterilized. Planting was carried out 96, 72, 48, 24 and 0
 hours after adding "T 581" to the soil. Germination precentage and
 the amount of dry matter produced by seedlings were evaluated. The
 parameters ware determined on four successive stages at four-day
 intervals. The findings are then commented upon.

 Abstract:  The African lunar moth, Argema mimosae (Bsd.), is
 endemic to south-central Africa. The larvae feed on the foliage of
 the marula, Sclerocarya caffra (Sond.), and may cause substantial
 defoliation which can reduce growth and/or fruit production. At
 average temperatures of about 25 degrees C eggs hatch after 10.9
 days, and the first to fifth larval instars are completed in means
 of 5.6, 4.2, 3.4, 5.8, and 14.1 days respectively. The pupal stage
 lasts 6-12 weeks in summer and 5-8 months in winter. The African
 lunar moth completes two generations per year. Marula trees are
 attacked during the months October to December and February to
 March when most of the larvae are in their fourth and fifth instar.
 The egg parasitoids Anastatus sp. (sp.a) and Mesocomys pulchriceps
 Cam. (Hymenoptera:Eupelmidae) have been reared from A. mimosae eggs
 placed in the field. In the laboratory two other eupelmids,
 Mesocomys vuilleti (Crawf.) and Anastatus sp (sp.b.), parasitise
 eggs of the African lunar moth.

 Abstract:  Three major components, ethyl-(E)-3-octenoate, geranyl
 acetate, and (E.E)-alpha-farnesene, emitted as volatiles by
 laboratory-reared and wild male medflies were collected and
 analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Peak emission of these
 compounds occurred during the third to fifth hours of the
 photophase arid differences were observed in the ratios of the
 three components emitted by male laboratory-reared and wild flies.
 These three compounds were synthesized, and a method was developed
 to formulate a synthetic blend that released the compounds in a
 ratio similar to that emitted by wild male medflies. Attractiveness
 of the blend to female medflies was demonstrated under field
 conditions by comparing trap catches. Black spherical traps, baited
 with the synthetic blend to release 1.6 male equivalents, caught
 significantly more females than blank traps and traps from which
 the blend released was 0.3, 3.2 or 6.4 male equivalents.

 Abstract:  Distribution of Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica
 Newman, grubs and dispersal of an entomopathogenic nematode,
 Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar 'Oswego' strain (an isolate
 from New York state), were examined for 5 wk within soil-filled
 flats containing grass. Japanese beetle grubs uniformly dispersed
 to all sections of the flats not infested with H. bacteriophora
 'Oswego' strain. In flats infested with H. bacteriophora 'Oswego'
 strain, however, greater proportions of Japanese beetle grubs were
 recovered in sections near the nematode release site or center
 sections of the flats. H. bacteriophora 'Oswego' strain dispersed
 to all sections of the flats but dispersed more rapidly within the
 flats infested with Japanese beetle grubs than in flats not
 infested with Japanese beetle grubs.

 Abstract:  Biological pest control is a reliable method and an
 economically profitable endeavour for growers of greenhouse crops.
 The fast evaluation and introduction of a number of natural enemies
 in situations where chemical control was either insufficient,
 impossible or undesired, has taught crop protection specialists
 that biological control, within IPM programmes, is a powerful
 option in pest control. Commercially available natural enemies are
 listed, current research in biological control is described,
 incorrect criticism of biological control is discussed and specific
 advantages of using this control method in protected crops are
 given.

 Abstract:  Several strains or species of entomopathogenic
 nematodes-steinernema carpocapsae Weiser (All), S. feltiae
 (=bibionis) (Filipjev) (Biosys strains 27 and 980), S. glaseri
 (Steiner), and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (= heliothidis) Poinar
 (HP88)-were tested in the field for control of japanese beetle,
 Popillia japonica Newman; Oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis
 Waterhouse; or black turfgrass ataenius, Ataenius spretulus
 (Haldeman) larvae. A spring field trial against A. orientalis, in
 which half of the plots were aerated to assist in nematode
 dispersal in soil, showed no significant differences between
 control plots and those treated with H. bacteriophora (HP88) or S.
 carpocapsae (All). A fall field trial in which half of the plots
 were dethatched before nematode application (to enhance nematode-
 larva contact) also showed no significant differences between plots
 treated with S. feltiae and control plots. Four other fall field
 trials with S. carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. glaseri, and H.
 bacteriorphora against japanese beetle larvae showed a range of
 0-81% control. The greatest mortality of P. japonica larvae
 occurred with S. glaseri at 24.7 X 10(9) per ha. A field trial with
 S. carpocapsae against A. spretulus showed 94% mortality at a 24.7
 X 10(9) per ha rate.

 Abstract:  Penicillaria jocosatrix Guenee consumes new leaves,
 flowers, and fruits of mango and has been a serious pest on Guam.
 Before 1986, few natural enemies were present and there were no
 parasitoids attacking the larvae. In 1986, a program was initiated
 to introduce larval parasitoids. The wasps Aleiodes sp. and
 Euplectrus sp. and the fly Blepharella lateralis Macquart were
 released. Aleiodes sp. did not establish, but Euplectrus sp. and B.
 lateralis did. Populations of the mango shoot caterpillar fell to
 25% of their prerelease levels. Parasitization rates ranged from 20
 to 99%. Euplectrus sp. was the most abundant parasitoid. It
 parasitized all instars, but was more common on second and third
 instars. More eggs were laid on older instars of the caterpillar.
 Euplectrus sp. was more abundant in the dry season whereas B.
 lateralis was more common in the wet season. Fruit production on
 monitored trees increased significantly after the parasitoids
 became effective.

 Abstract:  Females of the European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana
 Den. et Schiff.) usually deposit isolated eggs on flowers and
 berries of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). We have investigated
 whether an epideictic pheromone could be present on the egg surface
 to explain this spacing behavior. About 21,000 eggs of L. botrana
 were washed in cold methanol, and the biological activity was
 tested in a two-choice bioassay offering treated and nontreated
 areas. Different dilutions of the extract were tested in methanol,
 which was inactive alone. At the dose of four egg equivalents per
 microliter of extract, the number of eggs laid by the L. botrana
 females was reduced by as much as 57% on the treated areas compared
 to nontreated areas. A longer-term suppression of oviposition (at
 least 24 hr) following an exposure to the extract occurred for two
 doses (0.6 and 4.0 eggs/microliter) of egg extract. Our results
 strongly suggest the occurrence of an oviposition-deterring
 pheromone (ODP) on the eggs of L. botrana. The ecological value of
 these results is discussed.

 Abstract:  Bruchid beetles cause high losses of stored legumes in
 the tropics. Chemical control is inappropriate for the small scale
 farmer and the use of alternative measures should be encouraged.
 Different biological methods of control such as cultural, physical,
 varietal, biological, biorational and genetic control are reviewed.
 Cultural control techniques such as timely and frequent harvesting,
 legumes planted away from granaries, crop hygiene and storage in
 pods, are within the technical and financial means of the small
 scale farmer. The use of inert substances, vegetable oils and
 repellent plants may be cheap and effective if properly managed.
 The use of controlled atmosphere, vacuum, heating, cooling and
 sterilizing, requires relatively advanced techniques. Growth
 regulators and pheromones are currently not available for control.
 Varieties resistant to bruchids have been identified, but
 incorporation of resistance into suitable varieties has proven to
 be difficult. Biological control of bruchids should receive more
 attention in particular research on the introduction and
 conservation of natural enemies. To effectively implement control
 measures at farmer's level socio-economic and cultural aspects
 should be taken into account. Proven appropriate techniques should
 be combined in an overall integrated pest management strategy.

 Abstract:  Bacillus thuringiensis EG2838 and EG4961 are highly
 toxic to Colorado potato beetle larvae, and only strain EG4961 is
 toxic to southern corn rootworm larvae. To investigate the cause of
 the different insecticidal activities of EG2838 and EG4961, cryIII-
 type genes toxic to coleopterans were cloned from each strain. The
 cryIIIB gene, cloned as part of an 8.0-kb EcoRI fragment of EC2838
 DNA, encoded a crystal protein (CryIIIB) of 74,237 Da. The cryIIIB2
 gene, cloned as part of an 8.3-kb PstI-Asp718 fragment of EG4961
 DNA, encoded a crystal protein (CryIIIB2) of 74,393 Da that was 94%
 identical to CryIIIB. Analysis of the transcriptional start sites
 showed that cryIIIB and cryIIIB2 were initiated from a conserved
 region located within 130 nucleotides upstream from the translation
 start sites of both genes. Although the CryIIIB and CryIIIB2
 proteins were similar in sequence, they displayed distinct
 insecticidal activities: CryIIIB was one-third as toxic as CryIIIB2
 to Colorado potato beetle larvae, and CryIIIB2, but not CryIIIB,
 was toxic to southern corn rootworm larvae. Genes encoding crystal
 proteins of approximately 32 and 31 kDa were located adjacent to
 the cryIIIB and cryIIIB2 genes, respectively. The 32- and 31-kDa
 crystal proteins failed to enhance the insecticidal activities of
 CryIIIB and CryIIIB2.

 Abstract:  The chemical basis underlying orientation to fruit and
 fungal odors was investigated for the dried-fruit beetle,
 Carpophilus hemipterus (L.). in wind-tunnel bioassays of walking
 and flight response from 1.8 m, beetles were attracted to odors of
 the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar, aseptic banana, or
 banana inoculated with S. cerevisiae, although both banana
 substrates elicited greater response than the yeast alone. When
 presented in a two-choice bioassay, the yeast-inoculated banana
 attracted approximately twice as many beetles as did the aseptic
 banana. GC-MS analysis of the head-space volatiles above these odor
 sources revealed a somewhat more complex and concentrated volatile
 profile for yeast-inoculated banana than for aseptic banana. The
 odor from yeast on agar had fewer components, and these were
 present at lower concentrations than the odors of either banana
 substrate. By blending mineral-oil or aqueous solutions of the 18
 components of inoculated-banana odor in varying concentrations, it
 was possible to mimic closely the headspace profile of the natural
 odor. This synthetic odor also elicited beetle attraction in the
 wind tunnel at levels comparable to the inoculated banana. Through
 a series of bioassays in which individual components were
 subtracted from or added to a synthetic odor blend, it was
 determined that ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, 2-pentanol, and 3-
 methylbutanol comprised the simplest blend of compounds evoking
 full behavioral response. However, 2-methylpropanol or butanol were
 apparently interchangeable with 3-methylbutanol in this blend, and
 comparable response could also be elicited by replacing
 acetaldehyde with a combination of both 2-pentanone and 3-
 hydroxy-2-butanone. Thus, our results suggest that this generalist
 insect herbivore locates its host by a long-range response to a
 variety of blends of common fruit volatiles, whose concentrations
 are enhanced by fungi.

 Abstract:  Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say),
 larvae and adults were not behaviorally deterred from, and in some
 cases may have been stimulated to increase, feeding initially by
 the presence of M-One (Bacillus thuringiensis var. san diego) on
 foliage. However, consumption of M-One caused a decrease in
 subsequent consumption even of untreated foliage. Although certain
 feeding stimulants including sucrose, Coax, Entice, and a mixture
 of sucrose, amino acids, chlorogenic acid, and vegetable lecithin
 all stimulated feeding on foliage in laboratory tests either with
 or without M-One, this increased consumption did not increase
 subsequent mortality due to M-One. In a field experiment, increased
 consumption may have occurred where M-One was combined with Entice,
 but not to an extent sufficient to cause mortality greater than
 that on M-One alone.

 Abstract:  Our computer program is designed to help tree fruit pest
 managers make decisions on management of three major apple pests in
 western North America, codling moth, San Jose scale and
 phytophagous mites. The program operates on an IBM-compatible
 microcomputer and uses commercial expert system, database
 management and spreadsheet software. The system has three major
 components: DIAGNOSE, IDENTIFY and MANAGE. DIAGNOSE identifies
 pests from the injury they cause on buds, fruit, leaves or bark.
 IDENTIFY determines names of arthropod pests and their common
 natural enemies found on trees or fruit or in pheromone traps.
 MANAGE, the largest module, calculates the net benefit of a
 pesticide application. Submodels predict crop value, pest damage,
 control efficacy and control costs. Pest damage predictions are
 based on empirical models for codling moth and mites and on an
 expert estimate for scale. Efficacies of pesticides are estimated
 by experienced researchers. The program predicts the combined value
 at harvest of damage from accumulated populations of those pests
 selected by the user. Then a list of appropriate pesticides is
 presented. Next, the net benefit of an application of the user's
 choice of pesticide is calculated. Finally, the user may
 graphically compare side effects of the pesticide selected with
 those of alternative pesticides. Side effects include toxicities to
 other pests, applicator hazard, bee toxicity, toxicity to western
 predator mite and risk of resistance development.

 Abstract:  Several pyrethroid insecticides provided nearly 100%
 mortality of army cutworm, Euxoa auxiliaris (Grote), populations
 under field conditions in central Kansas. Performances of
 endosulfan and chlorpyrifos were variable, but they displayed
 adequate insecticidal activity against army cutworms. Bacillus
 thuringiensis var. kurstaki, carbofuran, ethyl parathion,
 malathion, and methyl parathion did not provide satisfactory
 control. Variation in vegetative growth and eventual wheat yields
 were not caused solely by larval populations of army cutworms.
 Moisture availability favoring vigorous plant growth was an
 important factor for plants to withstand army cutworm feeding. Use
 of insecticides to control army cutworms was found to be of
 variable profitability depending on the circumstances.

 Abstract:  The lack of data on temperature-dependent development of
 instars of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard is an impediment to research
 on biological control of this pest because parasitoids will likely
 interact differently with each instar. In this study, development
 times of eggs and instars of L. sativae were determined at constant
 temperatures of 20, 25, 30, and 35 +/- 1 degree C on Phaseolus
 lunatus L. 'Henderson'. Development rates of eggs and larvae
 increased linearly with temperature up to 35 degrees C (r2 greater
 than or equal to 0.95). More than 91% of the variation in
 development rate of first and second instars was explained by
 temperature, whereas temperature explained only 42% of the
 variation in third-instar development rate. A part of the variation
 in development rate of third instars may be explained by the fact
 that the designated end point of this stadium (emergence of third
 instars from leaves) occurred only during the photophase, Overall,
 99.9% of larvae emerged from leaves after 95 degree-days (DD)
 (threshold temperature, 10 degrees C). When the constant
 temperature data were used to parameterize a stochastic phenology
 model for L. sativae, the model predicted that 50% of the
 population would advance beyond the egg and first-, second-, and
 third-instar stages by 39.2, 67.0, 85.5, and 101.2 DD,
 respectively. The model predicted peak proportions of the
 population to be in first, second, and third stadia at 52.7, 76.1,
 and 93.2 DD. Pooled data from two fluctuating temperature
 experiments resulted in very similar estimates of timing of peak
 stage proportions (51.3, 74.4, and 94.1 DD, respectively). Degree-
 day values at peak stage proportions were used successfully to
 determine the temperatures required to advance members of a cohort
 to a particular stadium at a given time, thereby facilitating
 experiments examining interactions of parasitoids with each larval
 instar.

 Abstract:  The production of glasshouse ornamentals in the
 Netherlands occupies an area of 5278 ha. The total production value
 is 5.76 billion Dutch guilders. A characteristic of the Dutch
 ornamental industry is the wide range of products. About 110
 species of cut flower and 300 species of pot plant are grown.
 Reduction of pesticide use can be achieved by the development of
 alternative and additional methods, like the use of monitoring
 techniques, natural enemies, host-plant resistance and closed
 systems. Information is presented referring to developments in
 research, extension and practical application of these methods.

 Abstract:  Abundance of oriental fruit fly, Dacus dorsalis Hendel,
 and associated parasitoids was determined in a commercial guava,
 Psidium guajava L., orchard by canopy fogging and fruit collections
 during 1988 and 1989. D. dorsalis populations reached a maximum of
 2.6 adults per tree in 1988 and 1.4 adults per tree in 1989. Four
 parasitoid species were recovered from guava tree canopies;
 Biosteres arisanus (Sonan) was the most abundant species, followed
 by Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), Psyttalia incisi
 (Silvestri), and Biosteres vandenboschi (Fullaway), respectively.
 D. dorsaits and parasitoids recovered from guava canopies exhibited
 different sex ratios from populations that emerged from fruit
 samples. Abundance gf D. dorsalis and its parasitoids was
 correlated with the number of ripe fruit present in the orchard.
 Parasitoid abundance was correlated with D. dorsalis abundance in
 1988. Diversity and abundance of parasitoids estimated from canopy
 fogging and fruit collections differed.

 Abstract:  The effect of high population densities of citrus bud
 mite, Aceria sheldoni (Ewing), on the quantity and quality of lemon
 yields was studied for 4 yr in four commercial groves in coastal
 southern California. There were two treatments in each grove:
 treated plots where bud mite was suppressed with acaricide
 treatments whenever infestation levels increased markedly, and
 untreated plots where bud mite was not controlled. Average
 percentage of axillary buds infested with citrus bud mite was 7-15%
 in treated plots and 45-70% in untreated plots over the 4-yr
 period. Citrus bud mite feeding results in distortion of fruit
 shape which can result in commercial downgrading. Citrus bud mite
 control significantly reduced fruit distortion in all four groves
 and significantly improved commercial packout in three of the four
 groves. However, significantly less distortion in fruit was not
 detected in treated trees until harvests greater than or equal to
 10-13 mo after the initial acaricide treatment (lemons in coastal
 California are harvested three or four times per year). This
 supports the hypothesis that distortion in fruit is caused by
 citrus bud mite feeding on embryonic fruit tissue in the buds; once
 fruit set, they are unaffected by further citrus bud mite feeding.
 Up to 21 mo after the first acaricide treatments, the cumulative
 yield did not differ significantly between treated and untreated
 plots. In two of the four groves, in the eight harvests between 24
 and 48 mo after the first acaricide treatments, the cumulative
 yield was often significantly greater (9-13% greater) from treated
 than from untreated trees. The other two groves showed no
 significant differences in cumulative yield between treated and
 untreated trees up to the time of the last harvest (28 and 49 mo
 after the first acaricide treatment). In two groves, economic loss
 justified the cost of bud mite suppression, and in two groves, the
 cost of suppression exceeded the economic benefit of suppression.

 Abstract:  Effects of cyromazine and diazinon on eclosion,
 longevity, and reproduction of Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis
 capitata (Wiedemann); oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis
 (Hendel); and melon fly, B. cucurbitae (Coquillett), were
 determined. Eclosion and longevity of the braconid endoparasitoids
 Psyttalia incisi (Silvestri), P. fletcheri (Silvestri),
 Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), and D. tryoni (Cameron) and
 the reproduction of D. longicaudata and D. tryoni that parasitized
 fruit flies exposed to cyromazine and diazinon were also
 determined. Formation of puparia was not affected by cyromazine but
 was affected by diazinon in a concentration-dependent manner at the
 concentrations tested. At LC50 B. dorsalis and B. cucurbitae were
 more susceptible to cyromazine than to diazinon; C. capitata was
 equally susceptible to both chemicals. Eclosion of endoparasitoids
 from diazinon-treated hosts was concentration-dependent, but
 parasitoid eclosion from cyromazine-treated hosts was not
 significantly different from that of controls. Fecundity and
 fertility of B. cucurbitae were significantly reduced in females
 that survived treatment with 0.5 ppm cyromazine. Production of F1
 progeny by D. tryoni that eclosed from flies exposed to 1.0 ppm
 diazinon was significantly reduced. Cyromazine had no impact on
 progeny production of either D. longicaudata or D. tryoni at the
 concentrations tested. Potential use of cyromazine in conjunction
 with biological control for fruit fly eradication and control
 programs is discussed.

 Abstract:  The effect of fruit species on parasitization of
 Anastrepha ludens (Loew) by Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead)
 was studied. The roles of fermenting fruit volatiles, size, and
 color in host habitat selection by this parasitoid also were
 investigated. The lowest percentage parasitism was recorded for
 larvae in grapefruit, Citrus paradisi Macf. On the other hand,
 grapefruit volatiles and size proved most attractive to D.
 longicaudata. Greater percentage parasitism was recorded for larvae
 in smaller and apparently less attractive fruit. The length of the
 parasitoid's ovipositor, depth of the fruit pulp, and host larval
 behavior could explain these contrasting results. Citrus volatiles
 attracted almost twice as many female parasitoids as volatiles of
 mango, Mangifera indica L., or peach, Prunus persica L. Fruit > 5
 cm in diameter were equally attractive to D. longicaudata.
 Selection of colors by D. longicaudata was not statistically
 different among colors tested.

 Abstract:  Studies were conducted in 1988 and 1989 to identify the
 parastoid complex of lepidopterous pests of tomatoes in western
 North Carolina, and to assess the compatibility, of various
 insecticides with natural control of these pests. Trichogramma
 exiguum (Pinto & Platner) and T. pretiosum (Riley) were the primary
 egg parasitoids of Helicoverpa (= Heliothis) zea (Boddie) and
 Manduca spp. in 1988, whereas T. exiguum was the predominant
 species collected from H. zea and Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) in 1989.
 Parasitization of H. zea eggs on plants treated with endosulfan,
 methomyl, and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki did not
 differ significantly from the untreated control. However, egg
 densities were higher in synthetic insecticide treatments
 presumably because of disruption of predators in these treatments.
 Despite the low toxicity of esfenvalerate to Trichogramma spp. in
 laboratory bioassays, parasitization of H. zea and Heliothis
 virescens (F.) eggs in the field was significantly reduced on
 esfenvalerate-treated tomatoes. This decreased level of
 parasitization was attributed to an avoidance by Trichogramma spp,
 to pyrethroid insecticides, which was previously reported. Under
 the relatively low-density lepidopterous populations observed in
 these studies, the efficacy of specific insecticides against H. zea
 and T. ni was more important in preventing damage than the level of
 parasitization of these pests, because the treatment with the
 lowest level of parasitization (esfenvalerate + B. thuringiensis)
 had the lowest levels of fruit damage in both years.

 Abstract:  Applications of selected granular acaricide formulations
 to the shrub layer of forested habitats during the peak activity
 periods of Ixodes dammini Spielman, Clifford, Piesman & Corwin
 nymphs and larvae significantly reduced the abundance of these
 stages on Peromyscus leucopus. The granules effectively penetrated
 growing vegetation and suppressed populations of subadult ticks
 questing in the leaf litter. The use of granular acaricide
 formulations provides the only documented method of control of
 free-living I. dammini nymphs and larvae in dense vegetation. As

 Abstract:  Conidium germination and differentiation of Zoophthora
 radicans on water agar were investigated to identify requirements
 for the production of appressoria, the structures needed for
 virulence. Appressorium formation was more sensitive to
 environmental and nutritional changes than was conidium
 germination. Temperature affected both formation of germ tubes and
 appressoria, and the best temperature-nutrient interaction was
 found for appressorium formation at 25-30 degrees C and 1% yeast
 extract. At 15 degrees C, conidium germination was depressed
 independent of the nutrient concentration, and appressoria did not
 form. The volume of liquid overlaying the conidia and the yeast
 extract concentration individually affected appressorium formation.
 The best interaction between the volume of liquid and yeast extract
 concentration was the combination of a large volume of liquid
 medium (3 ml/962 mm2 surface area) and 1% yeast extract. Of the 12
 nitrogen sources tested, the best for germination and appressorium
 formation were yeast extract and Bacto-Soytone. Glucose, maltose,
 and starch were the best of the 12 carbon sources tested.
 Increasing osmotic pressure caused by different concentrations of
 maltose and polyethylene glycol adversely affected formation of
 germ tubes and appressoria. Subculturing did not affect formation
 of germ tubes, but the frequency of appressorium formation
 decreased after 12 transfers. The best pH for appressorium
 formation was between 7.0 and 7.2. Z. radicans produced appressoria
 on cuticles of dead Empoasca fabae (Harris) nymphs at 25 degrees C
 in the dark.

 Abstract:  The effects of herbivory by the Mormon cricket, Anabrus
 simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera:Tettigoniidae), and removal of
 sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) on understory plant biomass
 production and cover were determined. Averaged over a 3-yr period,
 50-75% removal of sagebrush resulted in an approximately 20%
 increase in summer understory biomass production; understory plant
 cover was not affected by sagebrusb removal. Mormon crickets, at
 densities of four and eight crickets per square meter during a 5-wk
 period, did not significantly affect understory plant biomass
 production but did reduce forb and total vegetative cover. Mormon
 cricket herbivory and sagebrush removal were independent with
 respect to their effects on understory vegetation. Furthermore, the
 incomplete removal of sagebrush did not affect the feeding ecology
 of Mormon crickets. Analysis of cricket crop contents suggested
 that sagebrush was fed upon predominantly; there was little dietary
 overlap between crickets and cattle. As long as some sagebrush is
 left intact (e.g., 25%), sagebrush control programs are unlikely to
 influence Mormon cricket diet selection or damage potential. Cover
 estimates, which are commonly used by ranchers and rangeland
 managers to estimate forage availability, provide deceptive
 assessments of cricket effects, untimely perhaps leading to an
 undeserved reputation as a rangeland pest.

 Abstract:  Field experiments were done in potatoes, Solanum
 tuberosum L., to evaluate various spray nozzle and volume
 combinations for control of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa
 decemlineata (Say), with synthetic insecticides and Bacillus
 thuringiensis. Colorado potato beetles were moderately tolerant to
 permethrin, and use of hollow-cone nozzles resulted in improved
 control compared with flat-fan nozzles. When flat-fan nozzles were
 used with permethrin, increasing spray volume from 103 to 298
 liter/ha resulted in a reduction in defoliation and an increase in
 tuber yield. Colorado potato beetles were highly susceptible to
 esfenvalerate. Nozzle type and spray volume had no significant
 effect on insect density or defoliation. However, a significant
 linear relationship existed between Colorado potato beetle counts
 and esfenvalerate spray- volume, On some sample dates, density of
 Colorado potato beetles was reduced in the high volume (467
 liter/ha) esfenvalerate treatment compared with the low volume (93
 liter/ha) treatment. Efficacy, of cryolite for control of Colorado
 potato beetle was not significantly influenced by nozzle type or
 spray, volume treatment. in experiments with B. thuringiensis var.
 san diego (M-One Insecticide), use of three hollow-cone drop
 nozzles per row resulted in significantly lower Colorado potato
 beetle density and defoliation, compared with use of hollow-cone
 nozzles arranged over the tops of the plants. Colorado potato
 beetle control with B
 thuringiensis was enhanced (with both nozzle treatments) by
 increasing spray volume from 140 to 560 liter/ha.

 Abstract:  In field studies, 'Regal' sweet potato greatly reduced
 yellow nutsedge growth when the two species were grown together
 using standard cultural practices. At the end of the growing
 season, yellow nutsedge shoot dry weight per m2, in plots where the
 two species were planted together was less than 10% of shoot weight
 in plots where nutsedge was grown alone. Presence of yellow
 nutsedge did not markedly affect sweet potato growth. When grown
 together in a greenhouse experiment designed to minimize the
 competitive effects of sweet potato on yellow nutsedge, yellow
 nutsedge growth was reduced more than 50% by sweet potato 8 and 12
 weeks after planting. The most polar fraction of serially extracted
 sweet potato periderm tissue was highly inhibitory to yellow
 nutsedge root growth. These results indicate that sweet potato
 interference with yellow nutsedge under field conditions is
 partially due to allelopathy.

 Abstract:  The entomogenous nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae
 (Weiser) and Heterorhabditis heliothidis (Khan, Brooks &
 Hirschmann) were used to control white grubs in turf and pasture.
 In the turf trial, nematode concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, or 1
 million nematodes per m2 were evaluated. only 12% of the grubs were
 killed by the nematodes at all three concentrations. In the pasture
 trial, nematode concentrations of 0.5 and 1.5 million per m2 were
 applied alone or in combination with diazinon (2.25 kg [AI]/ha).
 Comparisons (t tests) of the mean number of grubs recovered from
 each treatment area 2-4 wk after application showed significant
 reductions in the grub populations in both trials after certain
 nematode treatments. When applied at a rate of 1.5 million per m2,
 nematodes persisted for 8 wk after application in the pasture
 trial. In other tests of persistence, nematodes survived as long as
 5 wk after application. Nematophagous fungi were recovered from
 treated areas and untreated plots; however, no significant
 increases in numbers of propagules occurred after application.
 Predaceous mite populations did significantly increase after
 application in one trial. Many of these mites are considered
 nematophagous.

 Abstract:  The European grapevine moth (EGVM), Lobesia botrana, is
 a major pest of grapes in Europe. Females are attracted to a
 nonhost plant: tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.), which is a common weed
 in Slovakian vineyards. A steam distillate extract of tansy flowers
 was analyzed by means of a GC-EAG
 technique to screen constituents detected by the olfactory
 receptors of EGVM females. From more than 200 GC peaks, nine peaks
 corresponding to monoterpenoids released an EAG response in more
 than 70% of the females (N = 15): p-cymene, d-limonene, alpha-
 thujene, alpha-thujone, beta-thujone, thujyl alcohol, terpinene-4-
 ol, (Z)-verbenol, and piperitone. The steam distillate of tansy as
 well as a synthetic blend of identified compounds released
 consistent attraction in a field cage. The use of nonhost plants
 and host plant odors in integrated pest management is discussed.

 Abstract:  Since 1976 apple scab has been successfully controlled
 by fungicides applied according to infection periods in
 experimental plots and also in a steadily increasing number of
 commercial orchards. To guarantee adequate preventive and curative
 action at the same time captanoid fungicides (e.g. Capan, Folpet,
 Dichlofluanid) were applied in combination with compounds having a
 curative activity. In the seventies benzimidazol-fungicides were
 used as the curative component and after 1980 they were gradually
 replaced by sterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicides (SBI). To
 prevent storage diseases (mainly Gloeosporium species and storage
 scab) two sprays of captan are essential in late summer. Using
 captanoid fungicides is also part of the strategy to prevent
 buildup of resistance of Venturia inadequalis against SBI.
 Monitoring scab-resistance to SBI is of utmost importance since the
 control according to infection period depends entirely on their
 excellent curative action.

 Abstract:  Greenhouse and field experiments were performed to
 investigate diclofop rate and mowing height interactions on
 goosegrass control and 'Tifgreen' and 'Tifdwarf' bermudagrass
 tolerance. In greenhouse experiments, greatest goosegrass control
 was achieved with diclofop when plants were maintained at 1.3 cm.
 Increased diclofop rates were required to suppress goosegrass mowed
 higher than 1.3 cm or unmowed. Greater than 90% goosegrass control
 was achieved with the combination of 1.3-cm mowing height and 0.6
 kg ai ha-1 of diclofop. In field experiments, a minimum of 2 weeks
 was necessary for complete herbicidal activity. Diclofop at 1.1 kg
 ha-1 provided >90% control of goosegrass mowed between 1.9 to 2.5
 cm. The addition of nonionic surfactant (0.25% by vol) to diclofop
 did not influence control. The addition of metribuzin (0.1 kg ai
 ha-1) to diclofop resulted in initial increased control, but it was
 transient. The addition of MSMA (2.2 kg ai ha-1) to diclofop
 reduced goosegrass control an average of 18% compared to diclofop
 treatments alone. Tifdwarf bermudagrass was more sensitive to
 diclofop compared to Tifgreen. Seven to 14 days were required for
 Tifdwarf to recover from initial injury. This injury, although
 significant, was acceptable for bermudagrass used for golf greens.
 Clipping weights following treatment were also less for Tifdwarf
 than Tifgreen.

 Abstract:  Imidacloprid (code name: BAY NTN 33893; Chemical
 Abstract Name: 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-N-nitro-2-
 imidazolidinimine) is a highly effective insecticide being
 developed in the U.S. by Miles Inc. and by Bayer AG worldwide.
 Imidacloprid is a systemic and contact insecticide exhibiting low
 mammalian toxicity, with primary activity on sucking insects such
 as aphids, leafhoppers and planthoppers, thrips and whiteflies,
 including strains resistant to conventional chemistries. It is also
 effective against some Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera.
 Imidacloprid has a novel mode of action, and no cross resistance
 from any resistant species has been detected via oral ingestion of
 imidacloprid in worldwide field and laboratory testing. With
 excellent systemic and good residual characteristics, imidacloprid
 is especially appropriate for seed treatment and soil application.
 Effective early season control with long-lasting protection is
 achieved in crops such as cereals, corn, cotton, potatoes, rice,
 sorghum and many vegetables. Pests attacking later in the season
 can be controlled by foliar applications in the above-mentioned
 crops, as well as in citrus, deciduous fruits, grapes and other
 crops. General characteristics of imidacloprid, including
 biological activity, environmental safety and potential for
 Insecticide Resistance Management and IPM, are presented and
 discussed.

 Abstract:  Bacillus thuringiensis strain EG4961 was isolated from
 grain dust. This strain produces a parasporal inclusion body
 composed of a unique 74.4-kdal insecticidal crystal protein. This
 protein is toxic to larvae and adults of several Coleopteran
 species including Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata
 (Say), and southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata
 howardi Barber, a species that is relatively unaffected by the
 previously described CryIIIA insecticidal crystal protein. The
 discovery of EG4961 provides for the possibility of microbial-based
 control strategies for Diabrotica spp. and other Coleoptera.

 Abstract:  The relative short-term effect of three insecticides on
 predatory arthropods and their potential to interfere with natural
 predation on pest insects or to induce resurgences of white grubs
 were evaluated in Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., turf. A
 single surface application of isazofos in mid-June caused
 significant short-term reductions in abundance of spiders, ants,
 staphylinids, carabid larvae, histerids, and other predominantly
 predatory groups. Carbaryl and cyfluthrin also affected some groups
 of predators, but their impact was generally less severe than for
 isazofos. Pupae of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.
 Smith), and eggs of Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman,
 implanted into treated or control plots 1-2 wk after treatment
 sustained predation losses as high as 60 and 74%, respectively,
 within 48 h. Predation on pupae was not significantly affected by
 the insecticides, but predation on Japanese beetle eggs was reduced
 by as much as 70% in plots that had been previously treated with
 isazofos or carbaryl. Predatory Coleoptera, including Carabidae,
 Staphylinidae, Cicindelidae, and Histeridae, collected from
 turfgrass readily consumed Japanese beetle eggs or first-instars in
 laboratory trials. Plots treated with isazofos during the Japanese
 beetle oviposition period incurred significantly higher natural
 populations of white grubs than did control plots. These findings
 suggest that by disrupting predation on eggs and young larvae,
 insecticides applied to turfgrass before scarabaeid eggs have
 hatched could predispose lawns or golf courses to higher densities
 of white grubs and possibly other pests.

 Abstract:  Horsenettle is a deep-rooted perennial weed that cannot
 be easily controlled by mechanical means or by a single chemical
 application. A study was conducted at two sites for two consecutive
 years to identify biological factors that might limit its growth.
 Insects, nematodes, and plant pathogens were collected from
 horsenettle growing in bermudagrass pastures. The insects most
 commonly found included the Colorado potato beetle and the eggplant
 flea beetle. An unidentified lepidopteron, family Gelechiidae, was
 found at very low frequency as pupae in hollow leaf chambers
 constructed at the apices of flowering meristems. Infested apices
 bore no fruit. Seven genera of nematodes were found in the soil at
 both sites, but only very low numbers of lesion nematodes were
 recovered from horsenettle roots, and these had caused little
 damage. Root rot was observed under wet soil conditions on plants
 damaged by trampling. A downy mildew was prevalent at both sites in
 both years in October.

 Abstract:  Since early in the 1960s, strong research effort has
 been made on developing an integrated pest management system for
 different harmful insects and mites in fruit orchards. Better
 knowledge of the pest species and the beneficial insects and mites,
 have since 1965 resulted in a reduction of the pesticide use in our
 orchards by 70 percent. We have developed action tresholds for the
 most harmful phytophagous insects and mites. For one of our most
 serious pests on apples, the apple fruit moth, Argyresthia
 conjugella, a prognose--and warning system has been developed,
 which have reduced the insecticide use against this species from 2
 standard sprays a year to 1 spray each fourth year. Good results in
 using standard compounds of pesticides in very low concentrations
 have been obtained. These results are already taken into practical
 use by the fruit growers. In the principal fruit growing areas, we
 have established warming systems for apple- and pear-scab, which
 have resulted in a strong reduction in the yearly number of
 fungicide applications. Depending on the apple variety, a
 protection program against scab, mildew and storage diseases
 amounts to a total of 2-8 applications a year. A warning system for
 fruit pests and fruit diseases after a modified model used in
 Eastern Switerland, has been started in Western Norway this year.
 So far we have very good experience with the system and the feed-
 back from the growers are very positive. Now we were working on
 guidelines for an integrated fruit production. From 1990 we
 hopefully can start special courses for growers who want to get an
 authorization in integrated fruit production.

 Abstract:  The impact of grazing animals and plant protection on
 shrub seedling establishment was studied in 2 separate experiments.
 A total of 3,665 seedlings were monitored for survival during a
 sheep grazing trial in 1994, and 5,755 seedlings were monitored
 during a cattle grazing trial in 1986. Approximately 1/2 of the
 seedlings were located under the canopy of mature plants and 1/2
 were located in the interspaces between plants. The presence of
 domestic livestock and the seedling location affected both the
 overall survival at the end of the growing season and the pattern
 of survival during the growing season. The interaction between
 these independent variables resulted in the highest survival (0.11)
 for sheltered seedlings in the grazed pastures and the lowest
 survival (0.009) for unprotected seedlings in the grazed pastures.
 Seedlings in the ungrazed pastures had survival rates intermediate
 between these 2 rates. The pattern of seedling survival was similar
 in both experiments. Seedlings in the grazed pastures experienced
 high mortality during the actual grazing event and immediately
 after grazing. Seedlings which were unsheltered experienced the
 lowest survival due to trampling. Survival rates late in the summer
 were not affected by grazing but were dependent on receiving
 precipitation during this normally dry period of the year. The
 interaction between grazing and seedling location may partially
 explain the aggregated distribution of Artemisia found in many
 communities. This aggregation should affect interspecific
 competition and may play a role in later stages of plant succession
 within these shrub-dominated communities.

 Abstract:  The Dutch government has a coherent, long-term policy
 regarding attainment of a sustainable development affecting
 agriculture and horticulture, the requirements of which are very
 strict and will be difficult to satisfy. The growers of protected
 crops try to meet these requirements by developing so-called closed
 growing systems. Two other approaches in the policy are a
 substantial reduction of the volume of pesticides used and a very
 critical evaluation of the pesticides permitted. In this
 governmental policy, Integrated Pest Management has shown prospects
 in horticulture; it will play a very important role in the near
 future but is now considered as part of the broader concept of
 Integrated Production Systems. The glasshouse industry is very
 actively developing its own strategy to satisfy government targets
 and market demands for high-quality products produced by
 environmentally safe methods. The vegetable auctions have developed
 a policy of environmentally conscious production which should put
 the vegetable industry into a strong marketing position for its
 produce.

 Abstract:  In a screening program, 16 bacterial isolates out of 179
 isolated from roots and cysts caused a significant reduction (>
 25%) in Globodera pallida penetration of potato roots. Six of these
 isolates caused significant reductions in repeated greenhouse
 tests. Spray application of the bacteria in suspensions with 0.2%
 methyl cellulose increased adhesion of the bacteria on seed pieces
 and promoted antagonistic activity when compared to application in
 water suspensions. The antagonistic activity was shown to be
 directly correlated with the number of colony forming units (cfu)
 present on the tuber. The isolates Agrobacterium radiobacter and
 Bacillus sphaericus at densities of 9.7 X 10(8) and 3.16 X 10(9)
 cfu ml-1, respectively, caused significant reductions in root
 infection of 24-41% in repeated experiments.

 Abstract:  The effects of three chemical fruit thinners, carbaryl,
 naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and benzyladenine (BA), were compared
 on predatory and phytophagous mites in a petri dish assay and in
 four apple orchards. In the petri dish assay, 10 ppm of NAA was
 harmless (< 50% mortality) to the phytoseiid Amblyseius fallacis
 Garman, the erythraeid Balaustium putmani Smiley, and the stigmaeid
 Zetzellia mali (Ewing), but mortality of Z. mali was significantly
 greater than the control. BA (50 and 100 ppm) was also harmless to
 A. fallacis, B. putmani, and Z. mali, although A. fallacis and Z.
 mali had significantly more mortality than in controls. Carbaryl
 (600 and 1,200 ppm) caused 100% mortality of A. fallacis and
 94-100% mortality of Z. mali but was harmless to B. putmani. In
 orchard tests, NAA (8-10 ppm) was harmless (< 25% mortality) to
 mites in the families Phytoseiidae, Erythraeidae, Tetranychidae,
 Tydeidae, and Tarsonemidae, but it reduced densities of Z. mali for
 about 14 d. By comparison with controls and NAA, carbaryl
 (500-1,200 ppm) and BA (50-150 ppm) produced significant
 differences in numbers of Phytoseiidae, Z. mali, Tetranychidae,
 Tydeidae, and Tarsonemidae. However, carbaryl consistently produced
 significantly higher densities of Tetranychidae and lower densities
 of A. fallacis and Z. mali than BA, and in one orchard induced an
 outbreak of Tetranychus urticae Koch that exceeded the economic
 threshold of seven per leaf.

 Abstract:  Infestations of the navel orangeworm Amyelois
 transitella (Walker) in six central California "Nonpareil" almond
 orchards were studied for 12-13 yr (1978-1991) to determine the
 effect of imported parasitoids on host abundance. A decline in the
 average density of navel orangeworm to less than 0.5% in late
 summer as measured by percentage of attacked almonds was observed
 in five orchards where insecticides were not applied during the
 growing season. K-value analyses indicated a significant regulation
 of the navel orangeworm population by Goniozus legneri Gordh during
 the first generation on almonds after hull split. A slight increase
 in navel orangeworm abundance was observed in one orchard in 1986,
 after insecticide applications. Significant (but low) correlations
 existed between higher yields of edible almonds and lower navel
 orangeworm densities. No significant correlations were found
 between total rejected almonds and numbers of the peach twig borer,
 Anarsia lineatella Zeller, or ant damage. An integrated pest
 management program may be possible for soft-shelled almonds by
 retaining sufficient holdover almonds during winter for host-
 parasitoid reproduction during the spring, and by targeting other
 arthropod pests (e.g., peach twig borer and phytophagous mites)
 with controls that are nondisruptive to navel orangeworm
 parasitoids.

 Abstract:  Pesticide resistance management requires both technical
 progress in research and enlightened policies governing pesticide
 development, regulation, marketing and use. Improved monitoring
 systems, tactics of resistance management, models of resistance
 evolution, and experimentation on factors influencing resistance
 evolution have added to our ability to limit resistance in field
 populations of target pest insects. Greater emphasis on research in
 population genetics and ecology is needed to further extend this
 technology. Examples of successful resistance management with
 houseflies in Denmark, cotton bollworms in Australia, pear psylla
 in North America and a complex of pests and natural enemies on tree
 fruits in the United States demonstrate that policy-related factors
 can be a key to successful resistance management. Conversely, the
 lack of success in other pest systems may be due to antiquated
 policies. A recent case of resistance management in the spider mite
 Tetranychus urticae illustrates new policies by industry regarding
 research and pesticide labelling which will improve possibilities
 for resistance management and will extend the life of newly
 registered acaricides.

 Abstract:  Sampling for the gypsy moth fungus, Entomophaga
 maimaiga, was carried out in 10 plots in Connecticut to determine
 the importance of overwintering fungal load, rainfall, gypsy moth
 abundance, and physiographic site conditions to fungal prevalence.
 At one of the plots, gypsy moths were also exposed daily in cages
 on the soil and at 2 m in shrubs to examine the pathogen
 transmission potential of germinating resting spores and of conidia
 produced by diseased larvae. Gypsy moth population levels and an
 index of site moisture (as determined by tree composition) were
 marginally related to fungus prevalence. However, the relationship
 between fungal prevalence and population was an inverse one,
 opposite that found in a previous study. Resting spore load did not
 appear to affect prevalence; it is possible that a threshold effect
 occurs. Daily sampling showed that germination of resting spores is
 necessary for infection of early-stage larvae, but that conidia
 produced from diseased larvae are mainly responsible for infection
 of late-stage
 caterpillars. Maximum germination of resting spores occurred 1 or
 2 d after significant precipitation, whereas the greatest
 production of conidia from diseased caterpillars took place on the
 day of rainfall. We hypothesize that in areas where overwintering
 resting spores are abundant, the most important determinant of
 fungal effectiveness will be rainfall amount and pattern.

 Abstract:  Mortality of Cyclocephala hirta by the entomopathogenic
 nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was enhanced in grubs
 infected with the milky disease bacterium, Bacillus popilliae (Bp).
 In concentration-response assays with the nematode, LC50 values and
 95% fiducial limits were 4.0 (<0.1, 14.6) infective juveniles per
 grub for Bp-infected insects and 47.7 (32.0, 64.7) for non-Bp-
 infected insects. The increased mortality of Bp-infected insects
 was partially attributed to rapid penetration of H. bacteriophora
 through the midgut wall. In in vitro assays with ligated midguts,
 the time required for H. bacteriophora to penetrate the midgut wall
 of Bp-infected grubs was 0.6 +/-0.1 hr, whereas the time required
 in non-Bp-infected grubs was 1.3 +/- 0.1 hr. Total nematode progeny
 production per milligram grub tissue did not differ significantly
 between Bp-infected and non-Bp-infected grubs. However, the
 proportion of progeny remaining trapped in the non-Bp-infected
 cadavers at the end of the assay was greater than the proportion
 remaining in Bp-infected cadavers (0.52 +/- 0.04 vs 0.13 +/- 0.05,
 respectively). These data indicate that coexistence of these two
 pathogens within a host can occur and that B. popilliae could be
 used as a stressor on C. hirta to increase its susceptibility to H.
 bacteriophora.

 Abstract:  An isolate (87) of the yeast Pichia guilliermondii,
 protects apples from postharvest fruit rotting fungi Botrytis
 cinera and Pencillium expansum. In order to examine the yeast-
 pathogen interaction, B. cinera was grown on agar plates overlayed
 with cellophane. Effective and non-effective yeast isolates were
 applied near the young hyphal growth. Samples were taken 24 h later
 from the area where the fungi and yeast had intersected. Light
 microscopy revealed a general attachment of the effective
 biocontrol agent P. guilliermondii (isolate 87) and a non-effective
 isolate (117) of Debaryomyces hansenii. Low temperature scanning
 electron microscopy (LTSEM) indicated that both species of yeast
 attached to the fungal hyphae, but the 87 isolate attached
 fastidiously. Twenty-four hours after applying the 87 isolate to B.
 cinera, pitting and collapse of the hyphae were observed. These
 observations were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy.
 These features were not observed with the ineffective isolate of D.
 hansenii. Further experiments indicated that attachment of P.
 guilliermondii to hyphae of B. cinera could be blocked by agents
 that alter protein integrity (salts, proteases, etc.) and certain
 sugars. Isolates of both species produced beta-(1-3) glucanase when
 cultured in various carbon sources and on cell walls of fruit
 rotting pathogens. Culture supernatants from P. guilliermondii,
 however, yielded two-to five-fold more beta-(1-3) glucanase
 activity compared with D. hansenii. Data indicate that tenacious
 attachment, along with secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes,
 may play a role in the biocontrol activity of this yeast
 antagonist.

 Abstract:  Mortality to the egg stage of Colorado potato beetle,
 Leptinotarsa decemlineata(Say), from endemic predators was assessed
 in unsprayed plots within commercial potato fields in western
 Massachusetts in 1986 and 1987. Direct measurement of recruitment
 into the egg stage and of losses to predation gave estimates of
 total stage-specific mortality for each generation of Colorado
 potato beetle and daily mortality rates. Abundance of endemic egg
 predators was measured through direct observation and trapping.
 Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), a coccinellid, was the most
 abundant predator and the only one consistently present whenever
 Colorado potato beetle eggs were in the field. Total mortality to
 eggs from predation was 39.9% in the second generation of 1986 and
 37.8% and 58.1% in the first and second generations of 1987,
 respectively. Daily mortality rate did not change significantly
 during large fluctuations in prey density. Results suggest that C.
 maculata can contribute to the control of both early and late
 generations of Colorado potato beetle and efforts to conserve this
 natural enemy will help reduce the need for chemical control.

 Abstract:  Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge cv. Paraguayan-22)
 growing under newly planted peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch.]
 trees severely stunted the trees. Neither supplemental fertilizer
 nor irrigating with two 3.8-liters-hour-1 emitters per tree
 eliminated tree stunting; emitters were controlled by an automatic
 tensiometer set to maintain 3 kPa at a depth of 0.5 m under a tree
 in bahiagrass. Preplant fumigation with ethylene dibromide at 100
 liters-ha-1 increased tree growth, but not tree survival.
 Fenamiphos, a nematicide, applied under the trees each spring and
 fall at a rate of 11 kg-ha-1 had no positive effect on tree
 survival, tree growth, or nematode populations. Bahiagrass tended
 to suppress populations of Meloidogyne spp. under the trees.
 Meloidogyne spp. were the only nematodes present that had mean
 populations > 65 per 150 cm-3 of soil. Leaf concentrations of
 several elements differed between trees growing in bahiagrass sod
 and in bare ground treated with herbicides. Leaf Ca was low for all
 treatments in spite of a soil pH near 6.5 and adequate soil Ca. The
 severe stunting of trees grown in bahiagrass, irrespective of the
 other treatments, demonstrated that bahiagrass should not be grown
 under newly planted trees. The low populations of parasitic
 nematodes in bahiagrass showed that bahiagrass has potential as a
 preplant biological control of nematodes harmful to peach trees.
 Chemical name used: ethyl 3-methyl-4-(methylthio) phenyl (1-
 methylethyl) phosphoramidate (fenamiphos).

 Abstract:  An expert system termed NERISK was developed to evaluate
 the effects of pesticides on arthropod predators and parasitoids in
 a variety of agroecosystems. Based on a shell system (RECOG) with
 minor coding modifications, the system was designed to let even a
 novice user access the vast amount of information available on
 pesticide impacts on natural enemies. A large database (ca. 16,000
 records), a simulation model of microbial pesticide effects, and
 several expert opnion components have been organized and integrated
 into an easy-to-use yet robust program. This system can assist
 academic, industry, and regulatory personnel make decisions
 regarding the integration of pesticides with biological control
 agents in many cropping systems.

 Abstract:  A novel Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein with a
 silent activity against the Colorado potato beetle is described.
 The crystal proteins are produced as bipyramidal crystals. These
 crystals contain a protein of 129 kDa with a trypsin-resistant core
 fragment of 72 kDa. Neither a spore-crystal mixture nor in vitro-
 solubilized crystals are toxic to any of several Lepidoptera and
 Coleoptera species tested. In contrast, a trypsin-treated solution
 containing the 72-kDa tryptic core fragment of the protoxin is
 highly toxic to Colorado potato beetle larvae. The crystal protein-
 encoding gene was cloned and sequenced. The inferred amino acid
 sequence of the putative toxic fragment has 37, 32, and 33%
 homology to the CryIIIA, CryIIIB, and CryIIID toxins, respectively.
 Interestingly, the 501 C-terminal amino acids show 41 to 48% amino
 acid identity with corresponding C-terminal amino acid sequences of
 other crystal proteins. Because of the toxicity of the fragment to
 the Colorado potato beetle and because of the distinct similarities
 of the toxic fragment with the other CryIII proteins, this gene was
 given a new subclass name (cryIIIC) within the CryIII class of
 coleopteran-active crystal proteins. CryIIIC represents the first
 example of a crystal protein with a silent activity towards
 coleopteran insect larvae. Natural CryIIIC crystals are not toxic.
 Toxicity is revealed only after an in vitro solubilization and
 activation step.

 Abstract:  During a 2-yr survey of Klauai Island, four species of
 opiine parasitoids were recovered from host fruits infested with
 Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) [=Dacus dorsalis Hendel]: Biosteres
 arisanus (Sonan), Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), Psyttalia
 incisi (Silvestri), and Biosteres vandenboschi (Fullaway). These
 species constituted 87.5, 9, 2.4, and 1.1% of the total parasitoids
 recovered in 1988, and 95.1, 0.9, 4, and 0.04% of the total
 parasitoids recovered in 1989, respectively. Total islandwide
 opiine parasitism rates on the basis of live parasitoids recovered
 from oriental fruit fly pupae were 41.4% in 1988 and 53% in 1989.
 Wild common guava, Psidium guajava L., and strawberry guava,
 Psidium cattleianum Sabine, were the most prevalent hosts infested
 with oriental fruit fly encountered during our roadside survey.
 Population studies in a large commercial common guava orchard
 indicated that oriental fruit fly infestation of fruits was
 correlated with infestation of wild common guava fruits in
 surrounding wild habitats. Positive correlations between numbers of
 B. arisanus, the dominant parasitoid, and numbers oriental fruit
 fly indicated a density-dependent relationship. Overall, percentage
 parasitism of B. arisanus was significantly higher in wild habitats
 than in orchard habitats. Relative abundance of D. longicaudata, P.
 incisi, and B. vandenboschi were significantly higher in orchard
 habitats than in wild habitats.

 Abstract:  The population density of Helicotylenchus lobus and the
 percentage of the population with spores of Pasteuria penetrans
 were determined for 10 monthly intervals in naturally infested
 turfgrass soil at Riverside, California. The percentage of
 nematodes with attached spores ranged from 40% to 67%. No
 relationship was found between nematode density and the percentage
 of nematodes with spores. The mean and maximum numbers of spores
 adhering per nematode with at least one spore ranged from 2 to 8
 and 7 to 66, respectively. The mean number of spores per nematode
 (based on total number of H. lobus) was correlated with the
 percentage of nematodes with spores. Spores adhered to both adult
 and juvenile H. lobus. Between 9% and 32% of the nematodes with
 spores had been penetrated and infected by the bacterium. Many
 infected nematodes were dead, but mature spores were also observed
 within living adult and juvenile H. lobus that exhibited no
 apparent reduction in viability and motility. Spore and central
 endospore diameters of this P. penetrans isolate were larger than
 those reported for the type isolate from Meloidogyne incognita, but
 transmission and scanning electron microscopy did not reveal
 significant morphological differences between the two isolates.
 Spores of the isolate associated with H. lobus did not adhere to
 juveniles of M. incognita.

 Abstract:  Field tests were conducted in 1986 and 1987 to evaluate
 control of japanese beetle larvae, Popillia japonica Newman, in
 turfgrass plots by heterorhabditid and steinernematid nematodes.
 Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (NC strain) reduced
 populations a maximum of 60%, 34 d after a fall 1986 treatment.
 Control increased to 96% before pupation the following spring, and
 was 93-99% of the next larval generation. Application of
 Steinernema (= Neoaplectana) carpocapsae Weiser (All strain)
 provided a maximum of 51% control after 34 d, 90% the next spring
 (290 d after treatment), and 0% after 386 d. A spring 1987
 application of H. bacteriophora resulted in 68% control 28 d after
 treatment, and up to 67% of the following generation of japanese
 beetle larvae in the fall (138 d after treatment). H. bacteriophora
 (HP88 strain) gave 100% control after 28 d in the spring of 1987,
 and 93-97% control of the next generation of larvae. No adverse
 effects on nontarget organisms (mites or collembola) were observed
 28 d after treatments with any of the nematodes. Our data show that
 nematodes reproduce in japanese beetle larvae, survive in the field
 in turfgrass, and have an influence on target hosts for a longer
 period of time than previously demonstrated.

 Abstract:  Pratylenchus and Xiphinema species have been associated
 brambles (Rubus species) in the Pacific Northwest of the United
 States. These nematodes cause direct feeding damage and (or)
 transmit viruses that result in poor fruit quality and plant
 decline. A nematode management program has been developed by the
 author to minimize chemical use and nematode-induced damage while
 optimizing fruit production. Nematode management is an integral
 part of a total plant health care program in which foliar and soil
 pests, plant stresses, and fertility are managed.

 Abstract:  The population dynamics of the Colorado potato beetle,
 Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were studied in central Mexico in
 1987 and 1988. During the June-October rainy season, three
 generations were observed in 1987 and two in 1988. Predation and
 parasitism were found to be important mortality factors,
 particularly late in the season, contributing to generation
 mortality as high as 99.8%. Time series cross-correlation was used
 to estimate synchrony of Colorado potato beetle eggs with
 predators. Predators, including asopine pentatomids, carabids,
 thomisid spiders, and coccinellids, were abundant and well
 synchronized with developing Colorado potato beetle late in 1987,
 corresponding to the period of highest mortality.

 Abstract:  Nezara viridula (L.) attacks a wide range of crops in
 the tropics and subtropics and is a major pest of macadamias.
 Biological control of this stink bug, by the introduction of
 parasitoids, has been attempted in several countries with different
 levels of success. The combined action of the egg parasitoid
 Trissolcus basalis and adult parasitoid Trichopoda pilipes has
 provided successful control of N. viridula on macadamias in Hawaii.
 There are several additional parasitoids including the South
 American tachinids Eutrichopodopsis nitens, Trichopoda giacomellii,
 T. nigrifrontalis and Ectophasiopsis arcuata which have not been
 exploited. The potential of these and other parasitoids for
 biological control of N. viridula in macadamias, is discussed.

 Over a 5-yr period, 34% of all fields sampled contained parasitized
 corn earworm and 24.2% contained parasitized fall armyworm. Of
 3,036 corn earworm prepupae and pupae collected during this study,
 11.6% were parasitized; of 1,802 fall armyworm collected, 9.3% were
 parasitized. Parasitism by Steinernema sp. accounted for 49.4 and
 46.1% of the mortality of corn earworm and fall armyworm prepupae
 and pupae, respectively.

 Abstract:  Endosulfan, oxamyl, and esfenvalarate all were highly
 toxic to Perillus bioculatus (F.), a predator of the Colorado
 potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). Toxicity assays
 consisted of topical application to eggs, nymphs, and adults;
 exposure of nymphs to treated foliage; and ingestion by P.
 bioculatus nymphs of Colorado potato beetle larvae previously
 exposed to treated foliage. P. bioculatus egg hatch was unaffected
 by topical application of the pesticides. Topical application of
 neem seed extract to third-instar nymphs delayed molting and caused
 deformities after the molt in some insects, whereas the synergist
 piperonyl butoxide and the botanical insecticide rotenone caused
 significant mortality. Cryolite (sodium fluoaluminate), Bacillus
 thuringiensis var. san diego, horticultural oil, insecticidal soap,
 and three fungicides (chlorothalonil, maneb, and metalaxyl) caused
 very little predator mortality at any life stage tested. A control
 program using these materials would likely be compatible with the
 natural buildup of P. bioculatus populations or with augmentative
 release of this predator. In a small-plot field study, release of
 P. bioculatus in conjunction with bacterial insecticides provided
 significant control of Colorado potato beetles for at least 2 wk,
 suppressing larval populations by 76% compared with plots treated
 only with bacterial insecticides.

 Abstract:  Pitfall traps were used to monitor the seasonal activity
 of arthropod predators, parasitoids, and decomposers in replicated
 plots of centipedegrass turf for 3 yr (1989-1991) at two locations.
 During 1990 and 1991, the influence of single or combined
 herbicide, insecticide, and fertilizer applications on these
 beneficials was assessed. In total, 21 species of carabids in 13
 genera and 17 species of staphylinids in 14 genera were represented
 in pitfall-trap collections. Nonsminthurid collembolans, ants,
 spiders, and parasitic Hymenoptera were adversely affected in the
 short term by insecticide applications targeting the twolined
 spittlebug, Prosapia bicincta (Say). Other taxa, notably oribatid
 Acari, increased over time in response to pesticide or fertilizer
 applications. Although various taxa were reduced by pesticide
 application during three of four sample intervals, a lack of
 overall differences in season totals suggests that the disruptive
 influence of certain chemical management practices may be less
 severe than expected in the landscape.

 Abstract:  Data are presented on the residual activity of several
 insecticides against the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa
 decemlineata (Say), when applied to potato foliage under field
 conditions. Treated foliage was returned to the laboratory and fed
 to early (first and second), third, and fourth instars and adults.
 Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner subsp. tenebrionis (M-One) caused
 85% mortality of early instars at 1 h after application, and < 5%
 at 48 h. B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis (M-Trak) caused 90%
 mortality of early instars at 1 h and 20% at 72 h. Oxamyl (Vydate)
 + endosulfan (Thiodan) caused 98% mortality of early instars at 1
 h and 15% at 48 h. Esfenvalerate (Asana) caused 78% mortality of
 early instars at 1 h and 30% at 48 h. Cryolite (Kryocide) caused
 100% mortality of early instars at 1 h and 90% mortality after 96
 h.

 Abstract:  Oriental fruit fly, Dacus dorsalis Hendel, captures were
 higher on yellow and white than on orange, red, light green, dark
 green, blue, and black spheres hung in guava (Psidium guajava L.)
 trees. Captures were greater on 4-cm than on 2-cm yellow spheres.
 During a series of four 1-wk study periods, mean numbers of D.
 dorsalis captured on yellow and white spheres were 4.4 and 6.3
 flies per sphere, respectively. Four species of D. dorsalis
 parasitoids were also captured on 4-cm yellow and white spheres:
 Biosteres arisanus (Sonan), Psyttalia incisi (Silvestri), Biosteres
 vandenboschi (Fullaway), and Diachasmimorpha longicaudata
 (Ashmead). These species constituted 84.1, 5.3, 5.3, and 5.3%,
 respectively, of the total braconid parasitoids captured on yellow
 spheres and 83.3, 10.5, 3.1, and 3.1%, respectively, of the total
 parasitoids captured on white spheres. Mean numbers of B. arisanus,
 the most abundant opiine parasitoid, were 1.6 wasps per yellow
 sphere and 0.8 wasp per white sphere. This research indicates
 yellow or white spheres would be useful devices for monitoring D.
 dorsalis and parasitoid populations simultaneously.

 Abstract:  The attractiveness to A. ludens adults of a combination
 of odor of fermented chapote fruit and pheromone was compared to
 attractiveness of both chapote and pheromone in laboratory
 bioassays. The chemical treatments were tested on 2-day-old and 10-
 to 12-day-old (sexually immature and mature, respectively), virgin
 and mated, nonstarved and starved, males and females during the
 early afternoon when flies were sexually inactive and the late
 afternoon when sexually mature flies were sexually active. The
 chapote-pheromone combination was equal to chapote odor alone in
 attractiveness to males and mated females. Pheromone partially
 inhibited attraction of immature females to chapote odor. Chapote
 odor almost completely inhibited attraction of sexually active
 females to pheromone. The potential for using a combination of
 chapote and pheromone as a trap bait is discussed.

 Abstract:  For the first time, resistance to the CRYIIIA
 coleopteran specific delta endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis var.
 san diego or tenebrionis is reported. Colorado potato beetles,
 Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were selected in the laboratory
 after exposure in potato fields in Michigan. After 12 generations
 of selection, the selected strain was 59 times more resistant than
 the unselected strain and 24-35 times more resistant than other
 susceptible or insecticide-resistant strains. We observed no cross-
 resistance between organophosphate, carbamate, or pyrethroid
 resistance and B. thuringiensis resistance. No difference in
 movement induced by B. thuringiensis or initial feeding behavior
 was observed between selected and unselected strains, although a
 shift toward petiole feeding behavior was observed in adults (of
 both strains) that were stressed by B. thuringiensis. The selected
 strain oviposited at a reduced rate of 0.1 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- SD)
 egg masses per day) on treated foliage; the unselected strain was
 oostatic. Based on these results, it is recommended that resistance
 management strategies be developed and deployed for both
 conventionally applied B. thuringiensis products and B.
 thuringiensis transgenic plants.

 Abstract:  The orchard pests: codling moth, winter moth and leaf
 miners tested are effectively controlled by growth regulators:
 diflubenzuron, teflubenzuron and triflumuron. Diflubenzuron reduced
 considerably the population of apple blossom weevil and apple
 sucker. The selectivity of insect growth regulators to the tested
 predators (Anthocoris nemorum, Chrysopa carnea, Coccinella
 septempunctata, Episyrphus balteatus, Typhlodromus pyri) and
 parasitic wasp (Trichogramma cacoeciae) depends in a high degree on
 the predator species and their development stage. Generalising, one
 can say, that growth regulators are only partially selective to the
 majority of natural enemies of orchard pests.

 Abstract:  A technical grade lyophilized preparation of the
 Spodoptera exigua multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus
 (SeMNPV) was field-tested in small plots and compared with Bacillus
 thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Berliner) for control of the-beet
 armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) on tomatoes, peppers, and
 garbanzo beans in the Central Valley of California and tomatoes in
 the Guasave Valley of Sinaloa, Mexico. Weekly application of SeMNPV
 at rates of 2.5 X 10(11) and 12.5 X 10(11) occlusion bodies (OB)/ha
 gave season-long control of beet armyworm and provided significant
 reductions in plant damage compared with untreated control plots.
 On pepper and garbanzo bean, respectively, the level of beet
 armyworm reduction and foliar protection was significantly greater
 in plots treated with 12.5 X 10(11) OB/ha of SeMNPV than in the
 plots treated with B. thuringiensis. However, the degree of control
 achieved at the low rate of the virus was similar to the high rate
 of SeMNPV and B. thuringiensis on all crops tested. Bioassay of
 chrysanthemum leaves sprayed with the SeMNPV killed > 98% beet
 armyworm immediately after application and retained 50% of its
 original pathogenicity 7 d after treatment. Both Orzan LS and skim
 milk improved virus persistence. The results of these tests confirm
 the efficacy of the SeMNPV for control of the beet armyworm on
 several vegetable crops.

 Abstract:  After assimilating and killing host nematodes,
 Hirsutella rhossiliensis sporulates (i.e., produces external
 hyphae, phialides, and spores) from assimilative hyphae within the
 cadaver, the spores adhere to and infect nematodes. The ability of
 the fungus to sporulate from hyphae produced in vitro, rather than
 in host nematodes, was tested. Hyphae in the form of discrete
 vegetative colonies were grown in shake culture (potato-dextrose
 broth). In moist chambers, sporulation from vegetative colonies
 (rinsed free of broth) and from host nematodes was identical. To
 determine whether vegetative colonies sporulated in soil, vials
 were packed with nonheated, heated, or autoclaved loamy sand (17
 cm3) containing 0-50 rinsed vegetative colonies. After 14 days at
 20 C, healthy juveniles (J2) of Heterodera schachtii were added and
 recovered 66 h later. The percentage of J2 with at least one
 attached spore of H. rhossiliensis increased nonlinearly with
 increased numbers of colonies added per vial. The percentage was
 not affected by soil treatment, and virtually all J2 with attached
 spores were infected by the fungus. Approximately four vegetative
 colonies per 17 cm3 of soil were required to obtain 50% parasitism
 of J2 in loamy sand and in six other raw soils that varied in
 texture and other properties. Penetration of cabbage roots by J2
 was suppressed in raw loamy sand containing rinsed vegetative
 colonies. Vegetative colonies did not affect growth of seven plant
 species in the absence of nematodes. Results suggest that hyphae of
 H. rhossiliensis produced in vitro and added to soil without

 Abstract:  Hopper population was prevailing throughout the year in
 all types of orchard but it was higher in old orchard as compared
 to new and neglected orchard which may be due to different
 ecological conditions prevailing in different types of orchards.
 The results indicated that spraying of 0.2 per cent carbaryl in
 mango orchard during off-season (November 1983) does help in
 delaying the development of nymphal population during flowering
 period. This may help in avoiding the insecticidal spraying during
 flowering and fruit setting, and thereby protecting the pollinators
 in mango orchard which are active during this period.

 Abstract:  Irradiated adult Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis
 capitata (Wiedemann), were released at an average rate of 3 million
 per week for 5 mo in a sterile insect technique (SIT) program to
 suppress a wild C. capitata population in the 13-km2 area of Kula,
 Maui, HI. Concurrent with sterile fly releases, the braconid larval
 parasitoid Diachasmimorpha tryoni (Cameron) was released at an
 average rate of 388,000 per week. The average weekly overflooding
 ratio was 76.0 +/- 4.8 sterile/wild flies. Mean number (+/-SEM) of
 male C. capitata trapped per day was significantly reduced to 0.15
 +/- 0.05 in Kula compared with 1.30 +/- 0.17 in a nearby control
 area. The mean percentage of C. capitata eggs hatching was
 significantly lower in Kula (22.9 +/- 4.2%) than in the control
 area (90.2 +/- 0.9%). The overall mean percentage parasitism of C.
 capitata in fruit samples was significantly higher in Kula (47.2 +/-
  2.7%) than in the control area (20.3 +/- 3.1%). After the first
 month of parasitoid releases, D. tryoni became the dominant
 parasitoid present in Kula, representing 61.6 +/- 6.3% of the
 parasitoids recovered from C. capitata in fruit samples. The mean
 number of adult C. capitata recovered per kilogram of fruit was
 significantly lower in Kula (9.8 +/- 1.3) compared with the control
 area (92.6 +/- 22.7). This field experiment suggests that the
 concurrent release of parasitoids and sterile flies represents a
 valuable approach to eradication of established Mediterranean fruit
 fly populations.

 Abstract:  Field cage tests in 1987 established that releases of
 5-10 Perillus bioculatus (F.) and Podisus macutiventris (Say) per
 plant were able to reduce high density populations (approximately
 450 per plant) of Colorado potato beetle by approximatey 50%. P.
 bioculatus greater foliage protection than P. maculiventris. In
 1988, in similar cage tests, P. bioculatus released at rates of 2-8
 per plant reduced Colorado potato beetle densities of approximately
 100 per plant by approximately 8.5% per predator released. Field
 plot tests in 1988 confirmed cage results with P. bioculatus and
 demonstrated that 1 and 3 predators per plant suppressed
 populations of Colorado potato beetle by 30 and 62%, respectively.
 Three P. bioculatus per plant significantly reduced defoliation and
 increased yield 65% over the untreated control. Progeny production
 of a laboratory colony of P. bioculatus maintained on Trichoplusia
 ni (Hubner) larvae was equivalent to that for a colony maintained
 on Colorado potato beetle larvae. Our data indicate that
 inoculative releases of stinkbug predators for suppression of
 Colorado potato beetle populations could be an important component
 of an integrated management program.

 Abstract:  The objective of the study was to determine if exposure
 of young lambs to leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) would increase
 the consumption of this plant. Orphan lambs were exposed to leafy
 spurge from birth to 11 weeks of age as a water soluble extract
 mixed with milk replacer and as freshly harvested plants. Ewe-
 reared lambs were exposed to leafy spurge by grazing them on a
 leafy spurge-infested pasture. Study 1 investigated the consumption
 of vegetative and flowering leafy spurge paired with arrowleaf
 balsam root (Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh)Nutt.) by orphan lambs
 during a 30-min feeding period. Experienced lambs consumed a higher
 percentage leafy spurge than naive lambs (P<0.03). The interaction
 of leafy spurge phenophase and previous experience (P<0.02) showed
 that experienced lambs preferred leafy spurge regardless of
 phenophase (70% of intake) and naive lambs only preferred leafy
 spurge when it was vegetative. Study 2 investigated the preference
 for leafy spurge on pastures with high or low leafy spurge biomass.
 Experienced compared to naive lambs had a higher percentage of
 bites (P<0.001) and preferred leafy spurge in the high spurge
 biomass pasture, but not in low biomass pastures. Naive lambs
 avoided leafy spurge in both pastures. Study 3 was a pasture trial
 that investigated spurge consumption by orphan and ewe-reared
 lambs. Percent bites and time spent grazing leafy spurge were not
 affected (P>0.23) by previous exposure, but daily herbage removal
 was greater (P<0.09) in pastures grazed by experienced compared to
 naive lambs (876 vs. 685 g/lamb, respectively). Experienced ewe-
 reared lambs had a higher rate of biting on leafy spurge (P<0.06)
 than naive or orphan lambs. These studies indicate that previous
 experience will be an important factor affecting the use of sheep
 as a biological control agent for leafy spurge.

 Abstract:  Oviposition and development of the ichneumonid Trathala
 flavoorbitalis (Cam.) a parasitoid of the brinjal shoot and fruit
 borer, Leucinodes orbonalis Guen., was investigated. The parasitoid
 responded to a host larva by inserting its ovipositor (stinging)
 into the larva, whichever instar (first to fifth) it was. All the
 first and about 50% of the second instars that were stung and
 oviposited in, were mutilated and died as a result. Successful
 parasitization and parasitoid development up to adult emergence
 occurred in 53% of the third, 57% of the fourth and 41% of the
 fifth instar host larvae. When given a choice of instars for
 oviposition, the parasitoid avoided all first instar and most
 second instar larvae, while third to fifth instars were equally
 accepted. The total developmental time of the parasitoid was much
 the same (about 20-24 days) whichever larval instar (second to
 fifth) was parasitized. The parasitized host at pupation contained
 different developmental stages of the parasitoid, differing in this
 respect from most other species of larval-pupal parasitoids.

 Abstract:  Two field experiments were done to evaluate spray timing
 relative to peak egg hatch, of Bacillus thuringiensis var. san
 diego (M-One Insecticide, Mycogen Corp., San Diego, Calif.) for
 control of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)
 in potatoes. In the first experiment, 186.1 +/ - 4.5 (average +/-
 SEM) cumulative DD (n = 3 yr, 10 degrees C base threshold) were
 recorded from first oviposition by overwintered beetles until peak
 (33-64%) egg mass hatch. In 1989, when no rainfall occurred during
 the period when spray treatments were made, effective potato beetle
 control was achieved with B. thuringiensis if the first spray, was
 applied within 9 d of peak egg hatch and subsequent sprays were
 applied at either 5- or 10-d intervals. In 1990, when heavy
 rainfall occurred after the first spray, spray interval (5 or 10 d)
 had a greater effect on potato beetle control than did timing of
 the first spray application, and only the 5-d schedule treatments
 resulted in effective control. Results of a second field experiment
 in 1990 demonstrated that a 7- or 10-d interval between sprays of
 B. thuringiensis (following the initial spray at peak egg hatch)
 was too long to result in acceptable control of Colorado potato
 beetle if rainfall occurs after the initial spray. However, a 10-d
 spray schedule using an encapsulated formulation of B.
 thuringiensis var. san diego (MYX-1806, Mycogen Corp., San Diego,
 Calif.) resulted in effective control of Colorado potato beetle.
 Methods for estimation of peak potato beetle egg hatch in potatoes
 for use in timing of B. thuringiensis spray applications are
 presented.

 Abstract:  vPETE was conceived as a means to better integrate a
 phenological model into an expert system for Integrated Pest
 Management (IPM) in deciduous tree fruits. We discuss vPETE as an
 insect phenology model driven by degree-days via an operating
 system technique called a "PIPE" (Ritchie and Thompson 1974). A
 distributed delay routine is the basis of vPETE, which configures
 the life cycle of an organism and expands it for new generations.
 vPETE simplifies phenological modeling in larger software systems
 and is adaptable to many systems. Operating system techniques used
 by vPETE are dynamic memory allocation, stream input/output, and
 multitasking. All output from vPETE is communicated to a graphical
 display program or file. No human interaction is performed.
 Versions of vPETE run on parallel computing platforms.

 Abstract:  Studies were conducted in commercial greenhouses to
 examine seasonal population dynamics of western flower thrips,
 Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) on two crops: bell peppers,
 Capsicum annuum (L.) and long English cucumbers, Cucumis sativus
 (L.). Yellow sticky traps were used to monitor density and sex
 ratio of the dispersing adult population. Leaf and flower samples
 were taken to determine the spatial distribution of adults and
 larvae, and to investigate the relationship between trap catch and
 density of F. occidentalis on the plants. Trap catch peaked at
 different times during the growing season in each greenhouse. As
 trap catch increased, numbers of F. occidentalis adults and
 immatures on flowers and leaves also increased. On both crops, the
 majority (84-95%) of adults in flowers were females. Greater than
 85% of larvae were found on leaves. Adult male F. occidentalis were
 rarely found on plants, even when traps were catching high numbers.
 Female F. occidentalis were always found in flowers before they
 were found on leaves and were found on sticky traps only when the
 thrips population started to increase. Used together, sticky traps
 and flower monitoring allow quick detection of potential "hot
 spots" of thrips activity. Control measures can be applied
 immediately on a local rather than grand scale. Introductions of
 the predatory mite Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) did not control
 the thrips population in most of the greenhouses monitored.
 However, the minute pirate bug, Orius tristicolor (White), shows
 promise for future use as an effective biological control agent in
 commercial vegetable greenhouses.

 Abstract:  The white peach scale, Pseudaulacaspis pentagona
 (Targioni-Tozzetti) is a pest on the purple granadilla, Passiflora
 edulis Sims which is often grafted onto the rootstock of the red
 granadilla, Passiflora caerulea L.. The adult female feeds on the
 main stem of the granadilla and it moves up to the vines as the
 infestation increases. Severe infestations of the scale can cause
 die back of the granadilla stems and eventually the entire plant
 can die. The white peach scale can be bred on butternut pumpkins,
 Cucurbita moschata Duch. and potato, Solanum tuberosum. L.. At 25
 degrees C a life cycle took 42 to 56 days. The purple granadilla,
 Passiflora edulis and the yellow granadilla, Passiflora edulis
 forma flavicarpa Degener are very susceptible to the white peach
 scale. It was also found that seedlings contaminated with scale,
 died prematurely after being planted out. Two parasitoids have been
 identified in South Africa, namely Aspidiotiphagus sp. and
 Arrhenophagus chionaspidis Aurivillius, but they are not able to
 keep the white peach scale under control. A few parasitoids are
 found in other countries which should be introduced if biological
 control of the white peach scale is to be achieved.
