<p>THE army is not interested in any more ceasefires with the LRA rebels, the army spokesman has said.<br />
<br />
Shaban Bantariza said, "We have done it several times with no fruits. So why should we do it again?"<br />
<br />
He was responding to a call last weekend by a coalition of Civil Society Organisations for Peace in Northern Uganda (CSOPNU) that the government declare another ceasefire to get the peace process on course.<br />
<br />
"We urge the government to offer an extended ceasefire as an incentive for the LRA leadership to re-establish contacts. Only a substantial ceasefire will enable negotiators to build confidence and work together to plan a process for long-term peace," the CSOPNU statement read.<br />
<br />
But Bantariza said such extension would be of no purpose going by past experiences.<br />
<br />
"We encourage them (CSOPNU) to declare their ceasefire if they wish. For us we are not ready," Bantariza said on Monday.<br />
<br />
CSOPNU also urged the LRA to stop killing and abducting civilians.<br />
