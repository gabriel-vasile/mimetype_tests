		<h3>NSLS-II Anticipates Expected Needs of Its User 
		Community </h3>
		<p>The NSLS-II is scheduled to start full operations in June 2015. Staff 
		members are working on final engineering design documents, which will be 
		used to build the facility.&nbsp; After they are reviewed, the project 
		expects to receive approval of CD-3, which will allow construction to 
		begin.&nbsp; By early 2009, the project expects to award a $200 million 
		contract for ring construction. <a href="NSLS2.asp">More... </a> </p>

		<p>In the first demonstration of this technique, the research team 
		produced a 4 mega pixel image of a 14th century tooth and looked for 
		lead accumulation that might indicate the presence of lead poisoning 
		hundreds of years ago. The image was produced in just about six hours, a 
		task that would normally take days, Siddons said. The group is currently 
		building two 400-element detectors: one for the NSLS and one for the 
		Australian Synchrotron. </p>
		
		<p>The BNL group has also developed novel detectors for powder 
		diffraction experiments. In this technique, researchers illuminate a 
		crystalline sample with &#8220;hard,&#8221; or high-energy, x-rays, which are 
		scattered into very specific directions with various strengths. 
		Detectors are used to measure this &#8220;diffraction pattern,&#8221; which is then 
		processed by computers to determine the arrangement of atoms within the 
		crystal. </p>
		<p>The new devices, just 80 millimeters long and 4 millimeters wide, 
		contain 640 individual detectors arranged on 20extremely thin strips. 
		Each strip can register up to one million photons per second &#8212; a 
		performance level that no other competing detector can achieve, Siddons 
		said. The detectors group recently built three of these detectors: one 
		for Argonne National Laboratory, one for a beamline run by Brookhaven&#8217;s 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bnl.gov/cfn">Center for Functional Nanomaterials</a>, and another as a pool instrument for 
		general use at the NSLS. These new devices will improve data collection 
		for numerous materials science studies, from catalysts and semiconductor 
		technology to drug design, Siddons said.</p>
		<p>Although small, the NSLS detector group has made its presence known 
		around the world. The group is producing fast imaging detectors for the 
		LUSI project, a portion of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center&#8217;s 
		x-ray free-electron laser project; working with a Faculty and Student 
		Team (FaST) from Southern University in Louisiana on a detector meant to 
		pinpoint small concentrations of elements in environmental experiments; 
		and is starting up new collaborations everywhere from Brazil to Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always keeping my eyes open for places where a detector could 
		make a difference,&#8221; Siddons said.</p>
