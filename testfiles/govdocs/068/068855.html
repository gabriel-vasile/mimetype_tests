<h2>
<DFN>Summary</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The primary scientific objective of the High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (HESSI) is to understand particle acceleration and explosive energy
release in the magnetized plasmas at the Sun, processes which also occur
at many other sites in the universe. The Sun is the most powerful particle
accelerator in the solar system, accelerating ions up to tens of GeV and
electrons to hundreds of MeV. Solar flares release up to 10<sup>32</sup>-10<sup>33</sup>
ergs in 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup> s. The accelerated 10-100 keV electrons
(and possibly >~1 MeV/nucleon ions) appear to contain a significant fraction,
perhaps the bulk, of this energy, indicating that the particle acceleration
and energy release processes are intimately linked. How the Sun releases
this energy, presumably stored in the magnetic fields of the corona, and
how it rapidly accelerates electrons and ions with such high efficiency,
and to such high energies, is presently unknown.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The hard X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines are the
most direct signatures of energetic electrons and ions, respectively, at
the Sun. HESSI will provide the first hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy,
the first high-resolution spectroscopy of solar gamma-ray lines, the first
imaging above 100 keV, and the first imaging of solar gamma-ray lines.
HESSI combines an imaging system consisting of 9 rotating modulation collimators
(RMCs), each with a high-spectral resolution germanium detector (GeD) covering
energies from soft X-rays (3 keV) to high-energy gamma-rays (20 MeV). HESSI's
hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy provides spectral resolution of ~1 keV,
spatial resolution down to ~2 arcsec, and temporal resolution as short
as tens of milliseconds. These parameters are, for the first time, commensurate
with physically relevant scales for energy loss and transport of the >~10
keV electrons that are believed to contain much of the energy released
in the flare.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI's gamma -ray imaging spectroscopy will provide the first
imaging of energetic protons, heavy ions, relativistic electrons, neutrons,
and positrons; the first information on the angular distribution of accelerated
ions; and detailed information on elemental abundances for both the ambient
plasma and the accelerated ions.</DFN>
<p><DFN>With the fleet of spacecraft (SOHO, Wind, ACE, Ulysses, TRACE,
GOES, Yohkoh, SAMPEX, CGRO, etc.) that will already be in place, a HESSI
launch in mid-2000 would provide the crucial missing high energy measurements
needed for comprehensive studies of the solar maximum.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A two-year nominal mission (a third year is highly desirable) will
provide observations of tens of thousands of microflares, thousands of
hard X-ray flares, and of order a hundred gamma -ray line flares. Rapid,
direct access by the solar scientific community to the HESSI data and analysis
software, together with a U.S. Guest Investigator program funded from HESSI
MO&amp;DA funds, plus extensive foreign participation, will ensure the
maximum scientific return from this comprehensive data set.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI will also obtain hard X-ray imaging of the Crab Nebula with
~2 arcsec resolution, and monitor a large fraction of the sky to provide,
serendipitously, high spectral resolution observations of transient hard
X-ray and gamma -ray sources, including accreting black holes, cosmic gamma-ray
bursts, and terrestrial bursts from relativistic electron precipitation,
aurora, and lightning.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI's full-Sun field of view and storage of all information from
every photon in a solid-state memory (sized to hold all the data from the
largest flare) mean that flare data will rarely be lost and that mission
operations can be automated. A 600-km altitude, 38<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font>
inclination circular orbit is baselined to allow uplink/downlink to a single
ground station co-located with the Mission/Science Operations Center at
the PI institution.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The extensive heritage from the UCB HIREGS and GSFC HEIDI balloon
programs, and the UCB/GSFC FAST SMEX program, and recent NASA-funded technology
development efforts, enable the HESSI instrument to be built with no new
development. Spectrum Astro, our industry partner, will provide a simple,
reliable, and inexpensive Sun-pointed spin-stabilized spacecraft based
on subsystems already developed and flight-qualified from the Lunar Prospector,
MSTI, MightySat, New Millenium, and FAST/SMEX programs. Thus HESSI is ready
to be built within the SMEX cost and schedule constraints for launch in
mid-2000.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The proposed mission concept has been endorsed by numerous advisory
groups (e.g., NASA's Space Sciences Advisory Committee, and the National
Academy of Science's Committees on Solar and Space Plasmas and on Solar
Terrestrial Research), and was selected as a MIDEX alternate.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The HESSI team includes leading experts in solar high-energy spectroscopy
and imaging, with decades of space hardware and data analysis experience.
The team is committed to educational and public outreach, and has an outstanding
record of involving young scientists/engineers, both graduate and undergraduate,
as well as high school students and teachers.</DFN>
<h1>
<a NAME="goals"></a><DFN><u>D.1&nbsp; Scientific Goals and Objectives</u></DFN></h1>
<DFN>The processes of particle acceleration and impulsive energy release
occur in active cosmic plasmas at diverse sites throughout the universe,
ranging from planetary magnetospheres to active galactic nuclei. The understanding
of these processes is a major goal of space physics and astrophysics, but
we are just beginning to perceive the relevant basic physics. The Sun constitutes
an unparalleled laboratory for investigating these processes. Its proximity
allows measurements over the entire wavelength range to be made on physically
relevant scales. At the same time, the system as a whole can be studied,
and escaping energetic particles and plasma can be sampled directly. Further,
the complexity of solar magnetic fields and the solar atmosphere leads
to a broad range of acceleration phenomena, mirroring the rich diversity
of processes occurring on cosmic scales.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Solar flares are the most explosive of these phenomena. High-energy
emissions are the most direct signature of the acceleration of electrons,
protons and heavier ions in solar flares. The hard X-ray and gamma-ray
continuum is produced as bremsstrahlung by energetic electrons. Nuclear
collisions of energetic ions with the ambient solar atmosphere result in
a complex spectrum of narrow and broad gamma-ray lines that contain unique
information on not only the accelerated ions but also the ambient solar
atmosphere.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI will have sensitivity and dynamic range sufficient to provide
meaningful observations from microflares and the earliest emissions from
a flare, to the peaks of the largest flares. The high spectral and spatial
resolution of these observations will permit, for the first time, the deciphering
of the rich information encoded in both the gamma -ray lines and the highly
structured photon continuum. These high-energy emissions are accompanied
by longer wavelength emissions, and sometimes by escaping energetic particles.
Their observation by the fleet of spacecraft that will already be in place,
and by ground based instruments, will provide the crucial information on
the context in which the high energy processes occur.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="Part_acceleration"></a><DFN>Particle Acceleration and Energy Release</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Bursts of hard X-rays (>~20 keV) are the most common signature of
the impulsive phase of a solar flare (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-1">Fig.
D-1</a>). These X-rays are bremsstrahlung, produced by accelerated electrons
colliding with the ambient solar atmosphere. If these electrons are indeed
nonthermal (i.e., electron energy
<i>E<sub>e</sub></i>>><i>kT</i> of the
ambient gas), then the energy lost by the electrons to bremsstrahlung in
collisions with ambient ions is only a small fraction (~10<sup>-5</sup>)
of their energy lost to Coulomb collisions with ambient thermal electrons.
This inefficiency means that, for many flares, the energy in accelerated
>20 keV electrons must be comparable to the total flare radiative and mechanical
output (Lin and Hudson 1976). Thus the acceleration of electrons to tens
of keV may be the most direct consequence of the basic flare-energy release
process.</DFN>
<center>
<p><a NAME="Figure D-1"></a><img SRC="fig1.gif" ALT="Time profiles for a flare" height=361 width=521></center>

<h5>
<DFN>Figure D-1. Time profiles for a flare showing near- coincidence impulsive
peaks in 35-114 keV hard X-rays (from energetic electrons) and 4.2-6.4
MeV gamma-rays (from energetic ions).</DFN></h5>
<DFN>It is, however, still possible that a fraction of the hard X-rays
at tens of keV is quasi-thermal, i.e. produced by a Maxwellian population
of electrons with <i>E<sub>e</sub> <font face="Symbol">&raquo;</font> </i>kT
with <i>T </i>>~ 10<sup>8 </sup>K. Then the energy lost by one electron
in an electron-electron Coulomb collision simply increases the energy of
the other. In that case, the principal losses are due to conduction and
convection, which can be considerably less than the collisional losses
in nonthermal models. HESSI will determine the relative contribution of
thermal and nonthermal emission to the hard X-ray spectrum.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Hard (>20 keV) X-ray microflares, 10 - 100 times less intense than
small flares, occur every ~5 minutes (Lin et al. 1984) near solar maximum,
with the smaller ones occurring more frequently. Recently, high sensitivity
measurements down to ~8 keV with the CGRO BATSE experiment show that solar
impulsive bursts are observed >~3 times more often above 8 keV than above
25 keV (Lin 1997). Essentially every active region transient brightening
in thermal soft X-rays (Shimizu, 1995) is accompanied by an impulsive,
nonthermal >8 keV burst. This suggests that the flare process may be a
fundamental way by which stored magnetic energy is transiently released
in the Sun's corona (Parker 1988). If the nonthermal spectra extend down
to ~5 keV, the average rate of energy deposition by microflare accelerated
electrons, assuming nonthermal X-ray production, could be a significant
fraction of that required to heat the active region corona. HESSI's high
sensitivity imaging spectroscopy extending down to ~3 keV will allow the
systematic survey of the microflare non-thermal contribution to coronal
heating. At the same time these "simple" microflares may provide unique
insights into the basic flare acceleration and energy release processes.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="non_rel_ele"></a><DFN>Non-Relativistic Electron Acceleration</DFN></h2>
<DFN>During the flare impulsive phase, the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope
(HXT) often observes double footpoint structures (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-2">Fig.
D-2</a>), with the two footpoints brightening simultaneously to within
a fraction of a second (Sakao et al. 1994). These coincide, spatially and
temporally, with H-alpha and white-light brightenings.</DFN>
<p><DFN>For some flares occurring near the solar limb, HXT has detected
a co-temporal, weaker, hard X-ray source in the corona (Masuda et al. 1994;
Alexander and Metcalf, 1997) <i>above</i> the soft X-ray loop linking the
hard X-ray footpoints (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-2">Fig. D-2</a>).
This source has been interpreted as evidence for energy release by magnetic
reconnection in a region above the soft X-ray loop.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Very rapid transport of energy from the release site down to the
footpoint interaction regions is required. This can only be achieved by
fast electrons streaming down the loop and depositing their energy in lower
coronal and chromospheric footpoints, implying that nonthermal, tens of
keV electrons are interacting with a cool (<i>T</i>&lt;10<sup>5 </sup>K)
environment. The resulting heating of the ambient gas leads to evaporation
of chromospheric material and flare radiation in the visible, UV/EUV and
soft X-rays. Hard X-ray studies of electron time-of-flight (Aschwanden
et al. 1996a,b,c) further support this nonthermal thick target model, but
it is unclear how the implied huge currents (up to 10<sup>36</sup> electrons/s
or 10<sup>17</sup> amps) can conform to the global electrodynamic constraints
of the flare environment (Miller et al. 1997). HESSI's hard X-ray imaging,
with much higher dynamic range and temporal and spectral resolution than
Yohkoh HXT, is needed to study these coronal sources and electron streaming
in detail.</DFN>

the bright footpoints.&nbsp;</DFN></h5>
<DFN>Comparisons of microwave images with Yohkoh HXT images show a striking
tendency for flares with three footpoints, i.e. in which two loops of different
sizes appear to share a common footpoint (Nishio et al. 1997), suggesting
loop-to-loop interactions. Typically the two loops have quite disparate
sizes, with the longer loop (remote footpoint) initially visible only in
hard X-rays. HESSI's full-Sun observations, with high spatial and temporal
resolution and wide dynamic range, are key to understanding the energy
release in loop-loop interactions.</DFN>

(<i>left</i>) with the derived spectra of the X-ray producing electrons
[N(E)] (<i>center</i>) and the accelerated electrons [F(E)] (<i>right</i>)
(from Johns and Lin 1992).</DFN></h5>
<DFN>As we show below, high resolution X-ray imaging spectroscopy is the
key to understanding the acceleration and energy release processes. Precise
measurements of the solar flare hard X-ray spectrum can be directly inverted
to obtain the detailed spectrum of the parent X-ray-producing electrons
at the Sun. The scintillation (NaI or CsI) detectors used for all previous
spacecraft solar hard X-ray observations are inadequate for this task,
but cooled GeDs with their near delta-function response for continuum measurements
are ideal.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The first (and only) high-spectral resolution hard X-ray measurement,
obtained with a balloon-borne GeD spectrometer on 1980 June 27 (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-3">Fig.
D-3, left)</a>, immediately led to the discovery of a "superhot" ~3.5 x
10<sup>7 </sup>K thermal source (Lin et al. 1981). It also showed that
the nonthermal component does not fit a single power law or a single temperature
thermal, but has a relatively sharp break at ~50 keV.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Johns and Lin (1992) showed that these data can be numerically
inverted to determine N(E,t), the parent electron spectrum (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-3">Fig.
D-3, center)</a>. N(E,t) is the result of modification of the <i>accelerated</i>
electron spectrum F(E,t) by electron energy loss, propagation, and escape
processes. Assuming that Coulomb collisions dominated these loss processes,
Lin and Johns (1993) derived F(E,t) and found two separate components of
accelerated electrons: an impulsive spike component with a spectrum peaked
at ~50 keV, plus a slowly varying component with a power-law spectrum extending
down to ~20 keV (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-3">Fig. D-3, right</a>).</DFN>
<p><DFN>The peak in the spike electron spectrum suggests acceleration by
a DC electric field, with the peak energy corresponding to the total potential
drop in the field; such electron spectra are observed in the Earth's auroral
zone. Comparison of the observed thermal "superhot" and nonthermal hard
X-ray spectra with a model of heating and runaway electron acceleration
in a DC electric field (Benka and Holman 1994) allowed determination of
the electric-field strength, plasma density, and temperature in the flare.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI will provide the crucial key for determining the particle
acceleration process, namely the spectral, spatial, and temporal variation
of the accelerated electrons, F(E,r,t). The 2-arcsec and tens-of-millisecond
resolutions of HESSI are commensurate with the spatial and temporal scales
for the accelerated electrons to lose their energy in the lower corona
and upper chromosphere (ambient densities below ~10<sup>12 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>).
With HESSI's high energy resolution, the photon spectrum in each spatial
and temporal element can be directly inverted to obtain N(E,r,t), the X-ray
producing electron number density, as a function of energy (E), position
(r), and time (t).</DFN>
<p><DFN>N(E,r,t), together with information on ambient density, magnetic
field strength and topology, will allow the electron loss processes to
be directly evaluated. This will decide whether the X-ray emission is thermal
or nonthermal, since the energy loss characteristics of the emitting electrons
are so different in the two cases. Then, via transport calculations (using
a spatially dependent continuity equation including loss processes), the
spatially and temporally resolved accelerated electron source distribution,
F(E,r,t), can be obtained. Once N(E,r,t) and F(E,r,t) are obtained, detailed
quantitative models of the acceleration, energy release, and energy propagation
processes can be constructed and tested. This powerful technique is generally
applicable to HESSI's hard x-ray continuum measurements.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Non-imaging hard X-ray observations have already shown, via limb
occultation, that the upper corona may be the source of hard X-ray emission
of a different type (Hudson 1978), which may continue for tens of minutes
(Cliver et al. 1986) and extend to altitudes of some 160,000 km (Kane et
al. 1992). This emission could require as many as 10<sup>39</sup> electrons
above 5 keV with a total energy of 10<sup>31</sup> ergs in a volume 10<sup>30</sup>
cm<sup>3</sup>. HESSI will provide N(E,r,t) for this source to decide whether
it is related to the passage of shocks through the corona.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="sep_events"></a><DFN>Impulsive Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)
Events</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events observed in the interplanetary
medium (IPM) are of two types, impulsive and gradual, so-called because
of the temporal behavior of the associated flare soft X-ray burst (Lin
1987, 1994). Impulsive SEP events (~10<sup>3</sup>/year at solar max) are
rich in ~1-10<sup>2</sup> keV electrons and <sup>3</sup>He (Reames et al.
1985), with enhanced abundances of heavy ions (Fe, Mg, Si, S) and high
ionization states (e.g. Fe<sup>+20</sup>), suggesting high temperatures
or stripping.</DFN>
<p><DFN>These events are generally associated with small flares, and solar
type III radio bursts. The electrons escaping through the corona and IPM
generate plasma waves, which, in turn, combine to produce the radio emission
(see Lin 1990 for review). How the electron beam can propagate to >~1 AU
without losing all its energy to the plasma waves is not known. Soft X-ray
jets, recently discovered by Yohkoh (Shibata et al. 1992) turn out to be
the dense channels in which some type III bursts propagate (Kundu et al.
1995). The spectra of the escaping type III electrons observed in the IPM
are power-laws extending down to ~1 keV before a turnover, indicating a
high coronal origin (Lin et al. 1996). Comparisons of HESSI's determination
of N(E,r<i>,</i>t) at the Sun down to a few keV with soft X-ray images
and electron measurements in interplanetary space will help in understanding
the electron acceleration, escape, and radiation processes, as well as
the origin of the <sup>3</sup>He enhancements.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="rel_elect_acc"></a><DFN>Relativistic Electron Acceleration</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Relativistic electrons have been detected in solar flares by observations
of bremsstrahlung continuum emission extending up as high as several hundreds
of MeV. At energies of a few hundred keV the spectrum often shows a flattening,
indicating that a different mechanism may be accelerating the relativistic
electrons. HESSI will provide the first imaging in the energy range above
100 keV.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Electrons of energies from a few hundred keV to several MeV also
produce gyrosynchrotron radiation in the microwave and mm-wave region.
Recently, impulsive spikes of mm-wave emission, implying relativistic electron
acceleration, were detected by BIMA for even small flares (Kundu et al.
1990). Because the ratio of the magnetic field to the ambient density is
much higher in the coronal part of loops than in the footpoints, the centroids
of the microwave and soft gamma -ray sources will likely be spatially distinct.
Comparison of N(E,r,t) obtained by HESSI with the spatial distribution,
fluxes, and spectra of the microwaves and mm-waves, will provide information
on the angular distribution of the electrons, on the magnetic field strength,
and on the acceleration, trapping, and precipitation of the electrons.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="ion_acc"></a><DFN>Ion Acceleration</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Near the Sun, nuclear collisions of accelerated protons, alpha -particles,
and heavier nuclei with the ambient solar atmosphere result in a rich spectrum
(<a href="Science.html#Figure D-4">Fig. D-4 </a>and
<a href="Science.html#Table D-1">Table
D-1</a>) of lines (Ramaty and Murphy 1987). gamma -ray line emission has
been observed from many solar flares, mostly by the Solar Maximum Mission
(SMM) (Chupp 1990; Share and Murphy 1995). Energetic protons and alpha-particles
colliding with carbon and heavier nuclei produce narrow de-excitation lines
(widths of ~ few keV to ~100 keV), while energetic heavy nuclei colliding
with ambient hydrogen and helium produce much broader lines (widths of
a few hundreds keV to an MeV). Neutron capture on hydrogen and positron
annihilation produce narrow lines (at 2.223 MeV and 0.511 MeV, respectively)
which are delayed. HESSI will probe ion acceleration with the first high-resolution
spectroscopy of solar flare gamma-ray lines and the first imaging of solar
flare gamma-rays. HESSI's GeDs can spectrally resolve all the expected
lines except the 2.223-MeV line (see foldout Fig. D11-J at end of section);
none of these lines have been resolved by the solar gamma -ray detectors
to date.</DFN>

<h5>
<DFN>* For most lines, about 90% flare continuum and 10% instrumental background
for this bright flare.</DFN></h5>

<h5>
<DFN> **The narrow lines are for a downward beam or a fan beam; the single
broad line at ~0.45 MeV is for an isotropic distribution.</DFN></h5>

<h5>
<DFN> *** This line has an intrinsic width of ~0.1 keV, so we used the
instrument FWHM resolution (2.5 keV).</DFN></h5>
<DFN>HESSI will provide the first determination of line shapes, which are
direct probes of the angular distribution of the interacting accelerated
ions. The derived angular distributions will discriminate between various
transport and acceleration mechanisms. For example, ions which suffer strong
pitch-angle scattering into loss cones due to plasma turbulence in the
coronal part of the loops will mostly interact while going downward and
produce different line shapes than ions which interact while mirroring
near the loop footpoints.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The shape of the 0.511 MeV positron annihilation line gives information
about the ambient medium since the positrons slow down before annihilating.
HESSI's energy resolution at 0.511 MeV is sufficiently good to measure
temperatures down to 10<sup>4</sup> K, and it can easily distinguish among
annihilation sites located below the transition region, in the corona,
or in the hot (~10<sup>7</sup> K) flare plasma. The bulk of the annihilations
would occur in the corona if the magnetic field traps the positrons there.
Measurements of a positronium continuum below 0.511 MeV (from 3-photon
decay), which is prominent only if the density of the ambient medium is
less than ~10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup> (Crannell et al. 1976), will
show whether energetic ions have penetrated to regions of high density
(Hua et al. 1989).</DFN>

<p><DFN>HESSI has a unique capability to image in narrow gamma -ray lines,
where line counts dominate over the background (<a href="Science.html#Table D-1">Table
D-1</a>). Thus, both the 2.223 MeV neutron capture and 0.511 MeV positron
annihilation lines can be imaged. Although gamma-ray lines have never been
directly imaged, the 2.223 MeV line was once detected in a behind-the-limb
flare (Vestrand &amp; Forrest 1993). This line is formed when thermalized
neutrons are captured by ambient protons in the photosphere, at a much
greater depth than that at which nuclear reactions take place. Because
of the very strong expected attenuation, the neutrons must have been produced
by charged particles interacting on the visible hemisphere of the Sun.
Thus, either the acceleration site was far removed from the optical flare
site, or the charged particles were transported over large distances.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The continuum above 1 MeV (especially 4-7 MeV) is often dominated
by the broad lines from accelerated heavy (Z>2) ions, and can be mapped
to localize them. In a large gamma-ray line flare with good statistics,
the >3 MeV protons can be located by imaging the <sup>20</sup>Ne de-excitation
line. Locations and source sizes will be determined in large flares to
~35 arcsec, allowing footpoints to be identified. HESSI's gamma-ray images
will provide crucial information on acceleration and transport of energetic
heavy ions and protons.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI's high energy resolution allows it to separate closely spaced
lines (e.g. 1.634 and 1.778 MeV), but more importantly it dramatically
increases the sensitivity for detecting very narrow lines (e.g., the 2.223
MeV line). By observing the ratio between the 2.223 MeV line and the bremsstrahlung
continuum in many flares, HESSI will test whether ions are accelerated
in all flares, down to much lower flux thresholds than with SMM.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The bulk of the gamma -ray line emission is produced by ions with
energies of 10-100 MeV/nucleon that contain only a small fraction of the
energy in the ~>20 keV electrons. However, systematic study of SMM gamma
-ray line flares (Share and Murphy 1995) shows that the 1.634 MeV
<sup>20</sup>Ne<sup>
</sup>line is unexpectedly enhanced. Because the cross section for <sup>20</sup>Ne
has an unusually low energy threshold (~2.5 MeV), this effect may be due
to large fluxes of low-energy ions with a total energy content perhaps
comparable to that in accelerated electrons, rather than to an overabundance
of neon (Ramaty et al. 1995; Emslie et al. 1997). HESSI will provide the
first high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of the
<sup>20</sup>Ne line.
The ratio of the flux in this line to other lines will probe the ion energy
spectrum (and total ion energy content) down to ~1 MeV.</DFN>
<p><DFN>If DC electric fields accelerate the hard-X-ray-producing electrons,
then they may also accelerate many 100-keV protons (Holman 1995). Optical
H-alpha polarization is highly sensitive to low-energy (100 keV) protons.
Positive detections of H-alpha polarization in a few flares have been made
(Henoux et al. 1990), but their interpretation is uncertain. With simultaneous
HESSI ion and electron images and H-alpha polarization maps, the partition
of energy between accelerated electrons (derived from hard X-ray measurements)
and ions may be measured for the first time.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A very important discovery during Cycle 22 was that of long-duration
gamma -ray emission. GeV gamma -rays from pion decay were observed with
EGRET on CGRO for up to 8 hours after the impulsive phase of the 11 June
1991 flare (Kanbach et al. 1993). Nuclear line emission at 2.223 MeV was
also observed with essentially the same time profile (Rank 1996). This
strongly suggests that acceleration to GeV energies was ongoing for a very
long time. With its sensitivity, HESSI will observe the 2.223-MeV line
for several hours after a flare similar to the 11 June flare. These observations
will address the issue of particle trapping vs. continuous acceleration
in flares.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Time variation of the 2.223-MeV line can also be used to determine
the unknown <sup>3</sup>He abundance in the photosphere. <sup>3</sup>He
has a very high cross section for neutron capture and removes neutrons
from the population which produces the 2.223 MeV line. Not only is the
line flux reduced, but its time profile is changed in a way that can be
compared to models (Hua &amp; Lingenfelter 1987). The solar <sup>3</sup>He
abundance is essential for studies of galactic abundance evolution and
may have cosmological implications. Even though the coronal <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He
ratio is measured in the solar wind, the gamma -ray observations provide
a direct measure of the photospheric abundance.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Alpha particle interactions with ambient He produce <sup>7</sup>Be
and
<sup>7</sup>Li in excited states leading to line emission at 0.429
and 0.478 MeV. SMM detected larger-than-expected fluences of these lines
(Share &amp; Murphy 1997; Mandzhavidze et al. 1997). Either the abundance
of accelerated alpha-particles is higher than expected from SEP observations
(Reames 1994), or the abundance of ambient helium is much higher than the
photospheric values obtained from both helioseismology (Hernandez &amp;
Christensen-Dalsgaard 1994) and the standard solar model (Bahcall &amp;
Pinsonneault 1995). HESSI can detect a narrow line at 339 keV due to the
bombardment of <sup>56</sup>Fe by energetic alpha-particles leading to
<sup>59</sup>Ni in an excited state (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-4">Fig.
D-4</a>). This will distinguish between enhanced alpha-abundance in accelerated
particles or in the ambient medium.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Acceleration due to gyroresonant interactions with plasma turbulence
in impulsive flares is hypothesized to be responsible for the large e/p
ratios and <sup>3</sup>He enrichments (Temerin and Roth 1991). The enrichment
of heavy-element (in particular Fe) abundances in SEPs is another signature
of impulsive flares (Reames et al. 1994). Also, SMM observations (Share
&amp; Murphy 1995) have shown that the abundance ratio of low FIP (Mg,
Si, Fe) to high FIP (e.g., Ne) elements is enhanced in the de-excitation
region relative to the photosphere (Ramaty et al. 1995), as is already
is known for the corona from SEP measurements. Comparing HESSI's gamma-ray
determination of e/p and elemental abundances (both in accelerated particles
and in the ambient medium) at the Sun, with IPM measurements of the composition
of SEPs will test the hypothesis that gamma-ray flares and impulsive SEP
events have a common origin (Ramaty et al. 1993).</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="large_sep_events"></a><DFN>Large Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)
Events</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Gradual SEP events (tens per year at solar max) are generally large
(hence also called LSEP) events dominated by protons, with "normal" solar
abundance and ionization states typical of quiet 1-2
<font face="Symbol">&acute;</font>
10<sup>6 </sup>K corona, (e.g. Fe<sup>+13</sup>). These are associated
with large flares and fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CME's) driving shock
waves in the IPM.</DFN>
<p><DFN>In the most intense LSEP events, the fluence of protons sufficiently
energetic (>~50 MeV) to penetrate the walls of manned spacecraft is high
enough to result in a harmful or even fatal radiation dose to astronauts.
Such intense events also degrade electronic components on unmanned spacecraft.
SEPs can also penetrate deep into the atmosphere over the Earth's magnetic
polar regions and produce increased ionization, lowering the ionosphere
and disrupting radio communications.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The >~50 MeV proton flux in classic LSEP events generally shows
a rapid onset within about the particle travel time after a large flare,
indicating that the acceleration occurred close to the Sun at about the
time of the flare. LSEPs are thought to be accelerated by CME shocks close
to the Sun (Reames 1996). In the IPM, however, CME shocks appear to accelerate
particles only up to ~10 MeV, but not to >~50 MeV, unless an energetic
seed population is already present.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Studies by the NOAA Space Environment Center (SEC) show that the
best current predictor of LSEPs is the systematic spectral hardening with
time of the flare hard X-ray burst (Kiplinger 1995). The soft X-ray long-duration
events (LDE) associated with LSEP events appear to have hard X-ray emission
in about the same proportion as in impulsive events (Dennis and Zarro 1993;
Hudson et al. 1994). It is not clear how this LDE hard emission relates
to the impulsive flare burst.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Recently, the SOHO EIT has observed the "Moreton wave" phenomenon
of blast waves radiating directly from a flare site (Thompson et al. 1997).
Shocks in the corona within about 3 solar radii produce metric type II
solar radio bursts. These are flare-related and evidently not related to
fast CMEs (Wagner and McQueen, 1983; Gopalswamy and Kundu, 1995; Gopalswamy
et al. 1997). HESSI hard X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging,
together with observations of coronal shocks, SEPs, and CMEs, are needed
to understand the various ion acceleration processes at the Sun and their
relationship to flare electron acceleration, and for more accurate prediction
of LSEP events.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="context_obs"></a><DFN>Context Observations</DFN></h2>
<DFN>For interpreting HESSI's observations, knowledge of the physical parameters
in the regions of interest is essential. Imaging spectroscopy (down to
3 keV) by HESSI itself will reveal the temperature, density, location,
and temporal evolution of flare thermal plasmas, as well as the characteristics
of the low energy (&lt;20 keV) accelerated electrons that may contain the
bulk of the energy released.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), to be launched in early 2000 on a
GOES spacecraft (and SXT on Yohkoh if still operational), will provide
broad-band (6-60 &Aring;) images to determine the global and local morphology
of coronal features.</DFN>
<p><DFN>SOHO's EIT and CDS will provide EUV images and spectra that give
the temperature, emission measure, density, and velocity of plasma in the
chromosphere, transition region, and corona at temperatures ranging from
~2 x 10<sup>4</sup> K to ~2 x 10<sup>7</sup> K. SOHO/LASCO will provide
evolution, mass, momentum, and energy transport information on any coronal
activity, particularly CMEs, that may result in particle acceleration.
SOHO/MDI and ground-based instruments will provide measurements of magnetic
field strengths in the photosphere.</DFN>
<p><DFN>SEP and solar wind composition measurements will be provided by
Wind, ACE, SOHO, SAMPEX, and Ulysses. Wind and Ulysses also provide IP
radio measurements. For a HESSI launch in mid-2000 the required space context
observations will be available from the spacecraft that will already be
in place.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Microwave and mm-wave imaging/ spectroscopy will provide direct
measurements of preflare coronal magnetic fields plus thermal and nonthermal
electron parameters. Vector magnetograms will show the role of evolving
magnetic fields (e.g., emerging magnetic flux) and provide maps of electric
currents to define their relationship to sites of possible DC electric
field acceleration (Canfield et al. 1993). Optical imaging spectra provide
velocities in the lower atmosphere, a straightforward measure of the energy
that goes into chromospheric evaporation. Multiband optical imaging will
provide information on energy release, since the optical continuum emission
is thought to be the largest component of the radiative energy budget of
flares. Imaging H-alpha polarization measurements may provide a way to
detect ~100 keV accelerated protons. HESSI will provide support to ensure
that key ground context observations of the needed quality are available.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="non_solar_science"></a><DFN>Non-Solar Science</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Although designed as a solar instrument, HESSI provides a combination
of ~keV resolution, ~150 cm<sup>2</sup> collecting area, and wide field
of view (at 60<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font> - 120<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font>
to the solar direction) that makes it complementary to the ESA INTEGRAL
mission, which will have a narrow field of view.</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI will be an effective high spectral resolution hard X-ray/gamma-ray
all-sky monitor, allowing identification of transients (black-hole X-ray
novae, Be/neutron star binary outbursts, etc.) within days using occultation.
It benefits from the spacecraft's rotation, which will produce many detector/detector
occultations per minute, as well as from two brief Earth occultation periods
per orbit (Harmon et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 1993). HESSI will be able to
resolve cyclotron absorption features from bright transients such as A0535+26,
and the line shapes will test models of the neutron star polar region.
HESSI can also search for the line features between 10 and 100 keV reported
by Ginga in gamma-ray bursts but not confirmed by BATSE (Band et al. 1994),
and study the Galactic positron annihilation and
<sup>26</sup>Al decay
lines on angular scales larger than the INTEGRAL field of view.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Once a year a small offset pointing of HESSI (&lt;1<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font>
) would result in imaging of the Crab Nebula with unprecedented spatial
(2 arcsec) and energy (~1 keV) resolution. Although the nebula shows intricate
structure from radio through UV, with a tendency toward smaller sizes at
higher energies, it has been imaged in hard X-rays only once (Pelling et
al. 1987), with only 15 arcsec resolution and two energy bands. One day
of HESSI observation would give ~2 x 10<sup>5</sup> source counts from
25-35 keV, for ~300 sigma of total flux in the map. Maps could be made
up to ~200 keV. Yearly maps can show changes; significant changes in structure
have been seen in the radio and optical bands (Bietenholz &amp; Kronberg
1992).</DFN>
<p><DFN>HESSI will also provide high spectral and temporal resolution measurements
of terrestrial X-ray/gamma-ray emissions from relativistic electron precipitation
(Smith et al. 1995), auroral precipitation, and bursts associated with
lightning (Fishman et al. 1994).</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="expected_results"></a><DFN>Expected Results</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The total HESSI effective photopeak area (foldout Fig. D-11G) and
response to a large flare (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-4">Fig. D-4</a>
and
<a href="Science.html#Table D-1">Table D-1</a>) were obtained with
detailed Monte Carlo calculations, using the GEANT code and taking into
account the grids and all known materials in the cryostat and detector
modules. The orbit-average background (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-4">Fig.
D-4</a>) was similarly computed and is consistent with scaling from balloon-borne
GeD measurements.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The total count rates are shown in <a href="Science.html#Figure D-5">Fig.
D-5 </a>for the front and rear GeD segments. The turnover in the count
rates at high photon fluxes are due to dead-time from the pulse pile-up
rejection used to eliminate resolution degradation. Broadband imaging with
~10 keV resolution for the GeD front segment extends the dynamic range
to a 20 keV X-ray flux of ~3x10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
keV<sup>-1</sup>, while the GeD rear segment can handle flares with three
times higher flux, or up to ~30 to ~100 times larger than the 27 April
1981 gamma -ray line flare. Thus, HESSI is the first solar high energy
instrument to have the dynamic range to both detect microflares and make
quantitative spectral measurements of the largest flares.</DFN>

for the flares and microflares observed in 1980; and corresponding HESSI
total (9 GeDs) counting rates for front and rear segments.</DFN></h5>
<DFN>Assuming HESSI observes the Sun 60% of the time, and with the predicted
HESSI background, ~10<sup>2</sup> microflares per day will be detectable
above a 20-keV photon flux of ~5x10<sup>-3 </sup>photons cm<sup>-2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup> keV<sup>-1</sup>. Since a minimum of about a hundred source
counts is needed to form a simple image, the location and size of microflares
could be determined for ~40 events/day, with fluxes about three times larger
than threshold.</DFN>
<p><DFN>For ~2 events / day with >~10<sup>3 </sup>counts s<sup>-1</sup>
above 15 keV, rapid spatial changes of the hard X-ray sources could be
followed with simple images on time scales of 0.1 s, or full-Sun spectroscopic
studies with no imaging (e.g., Lin and Johns 1993) could be carried out
to obtain N(E,t). Detailed imaging spectroscopy providing N(E,r,t) could
be done with images in each of ten energy intervals with ~2-s time resolution
for one event every ~5 days with >~10<sup>4</sup> counts s<sup>-1</sup>
above 15 keV; crude imaging information could be obtained in tens of milliseconds.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Assuming that every flare accelerates ions with fluxes proportional
to the hard X-ray flux, the calculated 3 sigma sensitivities (<a href="Science.html#Table D-1">Table
D-1</a>) imply that the 2.223-MeV line should be detected, on average,
once every ~4 days, the 0.511-MeV line every ~14 days, and prompt de-excitation
lines every ~21 days.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The source location and size could be obtained every ~13 days for
the 2.223-MeV line, and once every ~60 days for the 0.511-MeV line and
the nuclear continuum from energetic heavy ions. Detailed spectroscopy
revealing many gamma -ray lines will be possible for these flares, allowing
the abundances of many elements to be determined.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Every six months, a flare can be expected that is sufficiently
large to locate the source of emission of narrow prompt de-excitation lines
from energetic protons. Thus, tens of thousands of microflares, thousands
of hard X-ray flares, and of order a hundred gamma -ray line flares will
be detected in the HESSI 2-year operating lifetime.</DFN>

the Instrument Electronics. The Imaging System is made up of nine Rotating
Modulation Collimators (RMCs), each consisting of a pair of widely separated
grids mounted on a rotating spacecraft (Fig. D-11K). Pointing information
is provided by the Solar Aspect System (SAS) and Roll Angle System (RAS)
(Fig. D-11K,M).</DFN>
<p><DFN>The Spectrometer (Fig. D-11N) has nine segmented GeDs, one behind
each RMC, to detect photons from 3 keV to 20 MeV. The GeDs are cooled to
&lt;~75 K by a space-qualified long-life mechanical cryocooler (Fig. D-11Q)
to achieve the highest spectral resolution (Fig. D-11J) of any presently
available gamma -ray detector. As the spacecraft rotates, the RMCs convert
the spatial information from the source into temporal modulation of the
photon counting rates of the GeDs. The Instrument Electronics amplify,
shape, and digitize the GeD signals, provide low-voltage power and GeD
high voltage, format the data, and interface to the spacecraft electronics.
Essentially all of the HESSI instrument components have extensive flight
or life-cycle heritage (<a href="Science.html#Table D-2">Table D-2</a>).</DFN>

<p><DFN>The energy and arrival time of every photon, together with SAS
and RAS data, are recorded in the spacecraft's on-board 2-Gbyte solid-state
memory (sized to hold all the data from the largest flare) and automatically
telemetered within 48 hours. With these data, the X-ray/gamma -ray images
can be reconstructed on the ground (see example, Fig. D-11B,O,P). The instrument's
~1&deg; field of view is much wider than the ~0.5&deg; solar diameter,
so all flares are detected, and pointing can be automated.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="imaging_system"></a><DFN>D.2.a.1. Imaging System</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The only viable method of obtaining arcsecond-class images in hard
X-rays and gamma -rays within the SMEX constraints is to use Fourier-transform
imaging. We use bigrid collimators consisting of a pair of widely separated
grids in front of an X-ray/gamma -ray detector (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-6">Fig.
D-6)</a>. Each grid consists of a planar array of equally-spaced, X-ray-opaque
slats separated by transparent slits. If the slits of each pair of grids
are parallel to each other and if their pitches (<i>p</i>) are identical,
then the transmission through the grid pair depends on the direction of
the incident X-rays. For slits and slats of equal width, the transmission
is modulated from zero to 50% and back to zero for a change in source angle
to collimator axis (orthogonal to the slits) of <i>p/L </i>where<i> L </i>is
the separation between grids (see <a href="Science.html#Figure D-6">Fig.
D-6</a>). The angular resolution is then defined as <i>p/(2L). </i>For
HESSI, the transmission of the source photons through the grids is modulated
by mounting the instrument on a rotating spacecraft. The detector records
the arrival time and energy of individual photons, allowing the modulated
counting rate to be determined as a function of rotation angle. Note that
the detector does not need to have any spatial resolution and hence can
be optimized for high sensitivity and energy resolution.</DFN>

<center>
<h5>
<DFN>Figure D-6. Schematic showing the instrument parameters that define
the imaging capability.</DFN></h5></center>
<DFN></DFN>
<p><DFN>For a parallel incident beam, the modulated waveform generated
by a smoothly rotating spacecraft has a distinctive quasi-triangular shape
(Fig. D-11O) whose amplitude is proportional to the intensity of the beam
and whose phase and frequency depend on the direction of incidence. For
complex sources, and over small rotation angles, the amplitude and phase
of the waveform provide a direct measurement of a single Fourier component
of the angular distribution of the source (e.g., Prince et al. 1988). Different
Fourier components are measured at different rotation angles and with grids
of different pitches.</DFN>
<p><DFN>For HESSI, the separation between grids in each RMC is L = 1.5
m and the grid pitches range from 34 &micro;m to 2.75 mm in steps of the
square root of 3 (see table of grid parameters - Fig. D-11F). This gives
angular resolutions that are spaced logarithmically from 2.3 arcsec to
>~3 arcmin, allowing sources to be imaged over a wide range of angular
scales (Fig. D-11H). Diffuse sources larger than 3 arcmin are not imaged
but full spectroscopic information is still obtained. Multiple smaller
sources are imaged regardless of their separation.</DFN>
<p><DFN>In a half rotation (2 s) the 9 RMCs measure amplitudes and phases
of ~1100 Fourier components for a typical source location, compared to
32 Fourier components for the Yohkoh HXT, so far more complex flare images
can be resolved. Detailed simulations have been made of HESSI's response
using image reconstruction techniques that have decades of heritage from
the mathematically equivalent problem in radio interferometry. These show
that HESSI can obtain accurate images with a dynamic range (defined as
the ratio of the brightest to the dimmest feature reliably seen in an image)
of up to 100:1. <a href="Science.html#Figure D-2">Fig. D-2 </a>shows a
simulation of an X1 flare similar in structure to that detected by Yohkoh,
illustrating that detailed high-resolution X-ray spectra can be obtained
for each location in the image, thus providing true high-resolution imaging
spectroscopy for the first time.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Although one half rotation is required to measure a full set of
Fourier components, the measurement of each component takes only a single
modulation cycle, which is as short as 1.3 ms for the finest grids. Thus,
when count rates are sufficiently high (>1000 c/s per detector), crude
images (from about ten Fourier components) can be obtained on timescales
of tens of milliseconds. The grids are oriented at large angles to each
other to optimize these fast images. If the source changes on these rapid
timescales, space-time confusion can be avoided by using normalization
techniques which exploit the fact that the modulation for each RMC occurs
at a different rate.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The grid material and thicknesses can be chosen to provide modulation
to energies as high as possible consistent with maintaining a ~1<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font>
FOV. We have chosen to have only two such maximum thickness grids, to provide
gamma-ray imaging while minimizing the loss in sensitivity for gamma-ray
line spectroscopy. Thus, with the grid parameters listed in Fig. D-11F,
imaging is possible with 2.3 arcsec resolution to ~40 keV, 7 arcsec to
~400 keV and 36 arcsec to >10 MeV (Fig. D-11H). Even allowing for the grid
absorption, the effective photopeak area for high resolution gamma-ray
spectroscopy is still ~80 cm<sup>2</sup> at 1 MeV (Fig. D-11G).</DFN>
<p><DFN>A detailed error analysis of the imaging performance has been carried
out and the critical engineering requirements shown in
<a href="Science.html#Table D-3">Table
D-3</a> were determined from a preliminary error budget. Changing the separation
(<i>L</i>) between grids or displacing the grids parallel to the slits
has little effect on imaging performance. A relative displacement perpendicular
to the slits affects the phase but not the amplitude of modulation. Any
such displacement will be accurately monitored by the SAS, and can be fully
compensated for in the image reconstruction process.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The critical alignment requirement is associated with the rotation
or
<i>twist</i> of one grid with respect to the other about the line of
sight to the source. A relative twist of <i>p/D</i> (<i>D </i>= diameter
of grid) reduces the modulated amplitude almost to zero. Thus, the grid
pairs must be well aligned in twist throughout the mission. For the finest
grids (2 arcsec resolution) a 1-arcmin alignment is needed. Thus, HESSI
can achieve arcsec-quality images with an instrument having only arcmin
alignment requirements.</DFN>
<p><DFN>It should be noted that Fourier-transform imaging is a relatively
"forgiving" process in that moderate alignment errors, even larger than
the 3 sigma numbers in the error budget (<a href="Science.html#Table D-3">Table
D-3</a>), generally only reduce the sensitivity of specific subcollimators
and do not reduce the angular resolution. In-flight knowledge of these
errors can be derived from the internal redundancy of the X-ray and SAS
data, and applied to the collimator amplitudes and phases to recover most
of the nominal telescope performance.</DFN>

<DFN>In practical terms, both Yohkoh HXT and SMM HXIS were coaligned to
arcsecond precision using similar technology (W&uuml;lser et al<i>.</i>
1995; van Beek et al<i>.</i> 1980). Recent experience with HXT data analysis
has shown how significant improvements in image quality can be achieved
using the self calibration possible with in flight data. HESSI has the
advantage that each RMC measures many Fourier components so that more extensive
self-calibration will be possible, resulting in very high quality images.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="grids"></a><DFN>Grids</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Two different techniques will be used to fabricate the 9-cm diameter
grids. For the finest two grid pairs, we will use photo-etching. Three
full-size, 25-&micro;m thick, gold grids with the finest, 34-&micro;m,
pitch have been made at JPL (Fig. D-11D). The gold grids are supported
on a 200-&micro;m thick silicon substrate with a pattern of holes in it
to allow X-rays down to ~3 keV through. These grids meet all our dimensional
requirements for the two finest grid pairs.</DFN>
<p><DFN>For the coarser seven grid pairs, we will use stacking of tungsten
blades with stainless-steel spacers in precisely machined Invar reference
frames. This technique was developed and patented by Co-I van Beek. He
has produced several test grids, including the over-sized 100-&micro;m
pitch grid (Fig. D-11E) that meets all requirements for Grid #3.</DFN>
<p><DFN>We have characterized both the JPL and the van Beek test grids
using the GSFC Optical Grid Characterization Facility (OGCF), and subjected
some of them to thermal cycling and launch-level vibration loads. As a
result of these tests, we have established that JPL and van Beek can make
the grids we need to meet all of our science objectives. Furthermore, both
JPL and van Beek have committed to meeting our schedule requirements.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="metering_struct"></a><DFN>Metering Structure and Grid Trays</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The critical alignment requirement for the metering structure is to
maintain the relative twist of the finest grid pair to within one arcminute
(<a href="Science.html#Table D-3">Table D-3</a>). The proposed metering
structure is based on the Telescope Demonstration Unit (TDU) built and
tested at GSFC (Fig. D-11C). The TDU's on-orbit alignment performance was
simulated using SINDA thermal models and NASTRAN structural models. The
results of this analysis and the TDU thermal and vibration tests demonstrate
that the proposed design satisfies all the mission requirements.</DFN>
<p><DFN>To maintain alignment following thermal and vibrational stresses,
flexural elements are used to mount the grids to the grid trays and the
telescope tube to the spacecraft. This approach was demonstrated with the
TDU and used successfully by Co-I van Beek in the Hard X-ray Imaging Spectrometer
(HXIS) on SMM, where the alignment requirements were significantly more
stringent. The fine grids will be precision aligned in twist by elastic
deflection of these flexure elements.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="tms"></a><DFN>Twist Monitoring System (TMS)</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Critical twist alignment will be monitored from initial assembly up
to launch by the non-intrusive technique illustrated in Fig. D-11L. This
was used successfully by Co-I van Beek to monitor the alignment of the
X-ray collimators on the HXIS. The basic technique has been demonstrated
at GSFC for digital readout by using a lensless CCD camera to determine
the relative location of diffraction rings from the two alternately illuminated
pin-hole sources. An easily measurable 1-&micro;m change in the relative
position of the diffraction patterns from the two pinhole/annulus combinations
is produced by a 6-arcsec change in twist of one grid with respect to the
other.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="sas"></a><DFN>Solar Aspect System (SAS)</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The SAS provides (1) high-resolution, high-bandwidth aspect information
for image reconstruction, (2) real-time aspect error signals for spacecraft
pointing, (3) monitoring of the relative twist of the two grid trays, and
(4) full-Sun white-light images for coalignment with ground-based images.
The SAS is similar to the aspect system on HEIDI that demonstrated 0.5-arcsec
performance at balloon altitudes. It consists of three identical lens-filter
assemblies mounted on the forward grid tray to form full-Sun images on
three 2048 x 13-&micro;m linear diode arrays mounted on the rear grid tray
(see Fig. D-11K and <a href="Science.html#Figure D-7">Fig. D-7)</a>. Simultaneous
exposures of three chords of the focused solar images are made every 10
ms by each of the arrays. A digital threshold algorithm is used to select
four pixels that span each solar limb for inclusion in the telemetry. These
digitized pixel outputs allow six precise locations of the solar limb to
be obtained on the ground by interpolation, thus providing knowledge of
Sun center in pitch and yaw to 1.5 arcsec (3 sigma ).</DFN>
<p><DFN>When the SAS is pointing to within ~0.2&deg; of Sun center, simple
algorithms using the limb pixel numbers also provide real-time error signals
with ~&lt;10 arcsec precision to the spacecraft Attitude Control System
(ACS). Use of the SAS in this way for both imaging and pointing avoids
problems of coalignment. The SAS is also used as a solar acquisition sensor
with an effective radial field of view of 46 arcmin by the detection of
a single limb in any one of the three diode arrays.</DFN>

<p><DFN>Although the aspect solution itself is independent of twist, the
internal consistency of the three independent solutions possible with the
built-in redundancy provides a continuous, highly sensitive measure of
the relative twist of the upper and lower grid trays during flight. The
SAS aspect requirement of 1.5 arcsec corresponds to a sensitivity to relative
twist of 0.4 arcmin. During prelaunch coalignment tests, this SAS twist
measurement is calibrated against that provided by the TMS discussed above.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="ras"></a><DFN>Roll Angle System (RAS)</DFN></h2>
<DFN>For image reconstruction on the ground (no impact on real-time spacecraft
operations), knowledge of relative roll is required at all times to 3 arcmin
(3 sigma ). Since all sources of torque on the spacecraft are weak, the
required information can be obtained with a star scanner that samples the
roll orientation at least once per rotation. Interpolation between measurements
allows the roll orientation to be determined at intermediate times with
the required accuracy.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The RAS (Fig. D-11M) consists of a 2048-element linear photodiode
array and electronics (nearly identical to those of the SAS) behind an
f/1.0, 50-mm lens. A sunshade limits the FOV so that a 30&deg; band is
swept out across the sky orthogonal to the spin axis. As the spacecraft
rotates, each detected star generates a brief spike in the output of one
or two pixels, whose timing defines the roll orientation. For +2 magnitude
stars, the detection signal-to-noise is 15:1. Allowing for Earth occultation
and the recovery time from anticipated Earthshine saturation, at least
one (and typically seven) such star(s) will be detected each rotation throughout
the mission. Measurements of only one star, averaged over a minute, allow
the roll angle to be determined to 2.7 arcmin (3 sigma).</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="spectrometer"></a><DFN>D.2.a.2. Spectrometer</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The spectrometer consists of the GeDs, front-end electronics, the
cryostat, and cryocooler (Fig. D-11N). We emphasize here that all aspects
of the spectrometer have already been developed.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="ge_det"></a><DFN>Germanium Detectors</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Germanium detectors cover the entire hard X-ray to gamma-ray line
energy range (up to ~20 MeV) with the highest spectral resolution of any
detectors (Fig. D-11J). They have been flown on the HEAO-3, Mars Observer,
and, most recently, Wind spacecraft (UCB designed/fabricated GeD). Internally
segmented GeDs appropriate for HESSI were developed by UCB (Luke 1984),
and since 1988 over twenty have been successfully flown on HEXAGONE, HIREGS,
and other balloon payloads (Smith <i>et al</i>. 1993, 1995; Pelling <i>et
al</i>. 1992, Feffer
<i>et al</i>. 1993). These have proven to be very
robust; the first ones fabricated and flown are still operating.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The HESSI GeD design provides wide energy coverage, from ~3 keV
soft X-rays to ~20 MeV gamma-rays with a single mechanically robust detector.
The largest, readily available, hyperpure (n-type) coaxial Ge material
(~7.1-cm diam x 8.5-cm long) will be used. The inner electrode is segmented
into three contacts that collect charge from three electrically independent
detector segments, defined by the electric field pattern (Fig. D-11R).
This provides the equivalent of a ~1-cm thick planar GeD in front of a
thick ~7-cm coaxial GeD, plus a bottom &lt;~0.5-cm "guard-ring".</DFN>
<p><DFN>The top and curved outer surfaces are implanted with a thin (~0.3-&micro;m)
boron layer to provide a surface transparent down to ~3 keV X-rays. The
front segment's closed-end "pancake" configuration is electrically identical
(with the same low capacitance) to a commercial ORTEC "LO-AX" GeD. Together
with an advanced FET and state-of-the-art electronics, this front segment
will easily achieve the 3 keV energy threshold of a LO-AX GeD. Thus, a
separate detector (and its electronics, etc.) is not required for 3-20
keV measurements.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A window of 20 mils rolled foil beryllium in the cryostat (similar
to HEXAGONE) covers the central ~0.2-cm<sup>2</sup> of each GeD with the
rest covered by 30 mils aluminum (Fig. D-11S), so that low energy photons
are absorbed in the high electric field region over the center contact
for optimal charge collection. This window allows for observations of the
iron line complex and thermal continuum down to 3 keV with ~0.5 keV FWHM
resolution.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The front segment thickness is chosen to stop photons up to ~150
keV, where photoelectric absorption dominates, while minimizing the active
volume for background. Front-incident photons that Compton-scatter, and
background photons or particles entering from the rear, are rejected by
anticoincidence with the rear segment; a passive, graded-Z (Pb, Cu, Sn)
ring around the front segment absorbs hard X-rays incident from the side,
to provide the unusually low background of a phoswich-type scintillation
detector (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-4">Fig. D-4)</a>.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Photons with energies from ~150 keV to ~20 MeV, including all nuclear
gamma-ray lines, stop primarily in the thick rear segment alone, with smaller
fractions stopping in the front segment, depositing energy in both the
front and rear segments, or in two or more GeDs. All these modes contribute
to the total photopeak efficiency (Fig. D-11G).</DFN>
<p><DFN>The intense 3-150 keV X-ray fluxes that usually accompany large
gamma-ray line flares are absorbed by the front segment, so the rear segment
will always count at moderate rates. This is essential for gamma-ray line
measurements with optimal spectral resolution and high throughput.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Photons >~20 keV from non-solar sources can penetrate the thin
aluminum cryostat wall from the side and be detected by the GeD rear segments.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Contamination of the intrinsic (flat rear) surface, leading to
increased surface leakage current and noise, is the most common failure
mode for GeDs. For planar GeDs and silicon detectors, guard rings have
long been used to isolate and drain off the leakage current of the intrinsic
surfaces. Two years ago, we (UCB) developed the first guard-ring coaxial
GeDs, using our segmentation technique to divide the internal electrode
&lt;~0.5 cm above the intrinsic (flat) rear surface (Fig. D-11R). Tests
with a prototype coaxial guard ring GeD showed no degradation for surface
leakage currents of one nanoamp (~ten times higher than usable for non-guard-ring
GeDs), and only a few hundred eV broadening in resolution for currents
of 10 nanoamps. This increased resistance to contamination, by a factor
of ~10<sup>2</sup>, allows the use of a single vacuum enclosure for all
9 GeDs instead of the more complex and expensive hermetic encapsulation
of individual detectors.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="rad_damage"></a><DFN>Radiation Damage Effects</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Reverse electrode (n-type) coaxial GeDs were chosen because of their
relative immunity to radiation damage. In the past few years, UCB has conducted
extensive studies which show that radiation damage is significantly lowered
by maintaining the GeDs at &lt;~75 K instead of the more normal >~85 K,
and avoiding warmups above ~85 K and/or high voltage cycling (R. Pehl,
private comm.). The cryostat/cooler is designed with large margins (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-8">Fig.
D-8</a>) to maintain GeD temperatures well below 75 K. The High Voltage
Power Supplies (HVPS) are on continuously after turn-on.</DFN>
<p><DFN>In two years near solar maximum, the HESSI 600 km circular, 38&deg;
inclination orbit results in a fluence of ~1.5x10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>
of >30 MeV protons at the GeDs, well below the >~3x10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-2
</sup>threshold for significant resolution degradation at 75 K. Thus, neither
shielding nor detector annealing (which can reverse the radiation damage
effects but entails risk and complexity) is required.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="ged"></a><DFN>GeD Modules and Cryostat</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The GeDs are mounted in a module (Fig. D-11S) identical to that for
the HEXAGONE and HIREGS GeDs, which have survived many balloon flights
and recoveries. The GeD in the module has been successfully vibration-tested
and is fully capable of surviving a SELVS II launch.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The GeD modules are mounted on an aluminum coldplate, essentially
identical to that for HIREGS. A thin IR radiation/ contamination shield
encloses and isolates the GeDs. A simple labyrinth seal prevents contamination
inside the shield from reaching unacceptable levels over the life of the
mission. The shielded GeD assembly is surrounded by a thermal blanket to
attenuate the parasitic thermal load on the coldplate. The input FETs are
mounted on the module close to the GeD for noise immunity, but thermally
isolated to provide operating temperatures of ~120-200K (not critical),
as in HEXAGONE and HIREGS.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The shield and coldplate are supported inside the cryostat vacuum
shell by low conductivity thermal mounts. The cryostat's curved side wall
are ribbed thin-wall aluminum near the GeDs to provide ~20 keV threshold
for X-ray/gamma-rays incident on the side. The GeDs are kept cold during
most ground operations by a liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) feed.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="cryocooler"></a><DFN>Cryocooler</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The GeDs are cooled on-orbit by a single electro-mechanical cryocooler.
Recently, under contract to NASA/GSFC, Sunpower Inc. has developed an inexpensive
single stage, integral (counterbalanced) Stirling cycle cooler which can
provide up to 4W of cooling at 77 K, with an input of 100W. This M77 cryocooler
has been designed for operational lifetimes greater than 50,000 hours,
using a gas bearing/flexure system to prevent contact of moving parts.
In extensive studies over the past two years at GSFC, M77 coolers have
been vibrated to the GEVS mandated 14.1 Grms, run under thermal vacuum
conditions from -25C to +30C, and life-tested already (continuing) for
~>10,000 hrs. Monitoring during these tests showed no internal contamination
of the working gas. Units already tested at GSFC are fully qualified for
flight, and will be used for HESSI.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A detailed thermal model of the cryostat (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-8">Fig.
D-8)</a>, taking into account the FETs, wiring, MLI blankets, support structure,
etc., shows that<i> </i>a single Sunpower cooler will cool the GeDs to
67 K with ~60 W of power, well below the 75 K required.</DFN>

<p><DFN>Recently, with NASA SR&amp;T funding we (UCB and GSFC) have conducted
tests for noise in the GeDs due to microphonics and electrical pickup from
the Sunpower cooler. A coaxial GeD in the standard UCB module was mounted
on a coldplate connected with a flexible thermal "S-link" to the cold tip
of the cooler (the configuration for HESSI). The cooler was run open-loop,
without active vibration damping in the tests. Microphonic and electrical
pick-up noise was found to be negligible, with no significant (&lt;0.1
keV) difference in the GeD energy resolution or noise background with the
Sunpower on or off.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The cryocooler electronics provides autonomous startup and shutdown,
efficient DC-AC power, and temperature/piston stroke control. These will
be packaged separately and mounted near the mechanical cooler.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="instr_elec"></a><DFN>D.2.a.3. Instrument Electronics</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Each GeD is biased at between 4 and 5 kV by a separate adjustable
HVPS (developed at UCB for FAST/SMEX and HIREGS). Photons interacting in
a GeD generate charge pulses, which are collected and amplified by a transistor-reset
Charge Sensitive Amplifier (CSA) (developed by UCB for HIREX) (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-9">Fig.
D-9</a>) to provide the best resolution and high-count rate performance,
and to avoid problems associated with pole-zero cancellation. The FET is
an advanced 4-terminal type (developed for UCB and baselined for the ESA
INTEGRAL mission) with 3-4 times the gain and half the capacitance of available
commercial units.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The CSA signal from the GeD front segment goes to two parallel
signal processing chains (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-9">Fig. D-9</a>).
The high resolution "slow" chain consists of a 9-pole quasi-trapezoidal
filter amplifier with a peaking time of 4 &micro;sec (developed by UCB),
a peak stretcher, and a 16-bit successive approximation ADC (flown on HIREGS).
To maintain optimum resolution at high energies >~1 MeV, quasi-trapezoidal
filtering is needed to compensate for ballistic deficit effects of the
charge collection in large GeDs. The upper 13 bits of the ADC provide 8192
channels of spectral measurements from ~3 keV to 2.7 MeV with ~0.33 keV/channel
at rates up to 50,000 c/s.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The high rate "fast" chain (developed for HIREGS) consists of a
delay-line shaper generating a triangular pulse of 0.5 &micro;s duration
(count rate capability >500,000 c/s), which is sent to a 4-channel stacked
discriminator ADC. When the slow chain saturates (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-5">Fig.
D-5</a>), the accumulated output of these four channels will be sampled
at a rate of 16 kHz to provide broad-band (deltaE/E ??1) imaging. The fast
channel LLD signal is used to detect front-rear and GeD-GeD coincidences,
and for pulse pileup rejection.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The GeD rear segment has two amplifiers in the slow chain, a normal
and a low gain (<a href="Science.html#Figure D-9">Fig. D-9</a>), as in
HIREGS. The ULD at 2.7 MeV switches the 16-bit ADC to the low gain amp
to provide ~2.4 keV/channel up to 20 MeV.</DFN>
<p><DFN>Data formatting follows that for HIREGS. For each detected photon,
14-bits of energy and time of arrival (to 60 &micro;s) are encoded together
with detector identification and coincidence flags into a 24-bit event
word. This word is latched and a flag raised to signal the formatter card,
(based on a FAST design) which simultaneously transfers and formats event
data into CCSDS frames. These are sent to the spacecraft mass memory system.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="data_st"></a><DFN>Data Storage</DFN></h2>
<DFN>Normally every photon is stored and then sent down. If an extended
extremely active period occurs, the main limitation is the orbit-averaged
downlink rate. The GeD rear segments' event rate is always low enough to
be stored. When the memory approaches full, the GeD front segments are
subsampled by collecting events for an integral number of half-spins for
full angular coverage to produce an image, and then not sampling until
the input rate matches the expected downlink rate. This method keeps the
mass memory from overflowing, with minimum loss of imaging and no loss
in gamma-ray spectroscopy. Of course, a second ground station could be
used to dump the data more rapidly if needed.</DFN>

<h2>
<a NAME="calib"></a><DFN>D.2.a.4. Calibration and Test</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The GeDs are calibrated with a set of radioactive sources ranging
from soft X-rays to ~2.6 MeV. Energies up to 15 MeV are obtained using
neutron-gamma sources. After integration of the Spectrometer, measurements
with radioactive sources are made over a range of energies and angles to
calibrate a detailed GEANT Monte Carlo model of the Spectrometer with the
precise geometry and all materials, as was done for HIREGS and HEXAGONE.
This model provides a detailed instrument response for data analysis.</DFN>
<p><DFN>After the Imaging System and Spectrometer have been independently
integrated into the spacecraft, radioactive sources are again used to measure
total transmission through the grid pairs, and confirm the GeD calibrations.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A calibration pulse generator injects a precisely generated charge
pulse into the CSA at ~0.3 Hz for GeD electronics calibration and monitoring.
During test mode, this pulser provides a precisely timed pattern of pulses
to mimic imaging. These test images are used to check the entire electronics
chain, onboard software, and imaging software on the ground.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A final test will be conducted prior to launch to provide end-to-end
verification of the performance by determining the modulation amplitude
provided by each grid pair in response to a moving X-ray source. For this
test, a small gold-foil `gridlet' will be used to define the geometry of
an ~100-microcurie source of X-rays (e.g., <sup>109</sup>Cd). For suitable
distances from the front grids (typically 1-2 m), the gridlet geometry
is selected so that PC-controlled motion of the gridlet/source assembly
produces strong and calculable modulation in the transmitted photon flux
through each grid pair in turn. Data on the X-rays detected with the germanium
detectors are recorded and pass through the complete flight data system.
The measured modulation as compared to the expected modulation for each
grid pair gives an accurate indication of overall performance of the Imaging
System.</DFN>
<p><DFN>In-flight, systematic studies of many solar bursts can provide
excellent self-calibration, as shown by Yohkoh HXT, and separating out
the pulsed emission from the Crab provides a point-source calibration.
Ge background lines provide excellent absolute gain calibration.</DFN>
<p><DFN></DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="mission"></a><DFN>D.2.b.Mission</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The requirements imposed by HESSI on the spacecraft (Table F-2) can
be met by a simple Sun-pointed, spin-stabilized spacecraft. The instrument
field of view (>~&deg; ) is much larger than the Sun (0.5&deg; ) so spacecraft
pointing is relaxed and can be automated. The instrument is on continuously.
All of the photon data for the largest flare can be stored in the spacecraft
memory and downlinked in &lt;~48 hours, so flare data will rarely, if ever,
be lost. Consequently, HESSI is planned for an automated store-and-dump
operation, and normally no real-time access is required.</DFN>
<p><DFN>The 600 km circular, 38&deg; inclination orbit can be provided
by a standard SELVS II launch. A single LEO-T ground station at UCB provides
the required data downlink rate (~1 Gbyte/day), and minimizes tracking,
data transmission, and operation costs while allowing the involvement of
many students (as in EUVE and FAST). Both the instrument and spacecraft
are designed to operate autonomously for weeks at a time, so a single-shift,
5-day-a-week staffing is sufficient.</DFN>
<h2>
<a NAME="launch"></a><DFN>Launch Date</DFN></h2>
<DFN><a href="Science.html#Figure D-10">Figure D-10 </a>shows the predictions
of the integrated total number of solar hard (>20 keV) X-ray and gamma-ray
(>300 keV) flares occurring in a two-year nominal HESSI mission, based
on the observations of the previous two cycles and the mean period for
the last seven cycles of 10.5 years. Even with the uncertainty of &plusmn;
1 year in the predictions, a HESSI launch in mid 2000 as the first of the
two SMEX missions selected by this AO, would be ideal. A launch in 2001
would still be acceptable.</DFN>

<h2>
<a NAME="data_anal"></a><DFN>D.2.c. Data Analysis and Archiving</DFN></h2>
<DFN>HESSI differs from many imagers in that, instead of transmitting a
preselected subset of images, the telemetry includes all of the information
about each detected photon. Thus, the data analyst can make tradeoffs among
time resolution, spectral range and resolution, spatial resolution, image
quality, etc., on the ground. These decisions can be made on a case-by-case
basis to match the unique characteristics of the event under study and
the relevant scientific objective. A key driver of our data analysis approach
is the preservation of this flexibility so as to extract the maximum scientific
return from the observations. This means that all detailed scientific analysis
will use the same primary database with the most current calibration information.</DFN>
<p><DFN>In implementing this approach for HESSI data reduction and analysis,
we plan for: 1) the complete data output of the HESSI mission to be made
available promptly to the scientific community, without restriction; and
2) a fully documented analysis package, supported by a range of platforms,
to be available to the scientific community, with the same toolbox of software
used by the PI team. A promptly-generated catalog of summary data products
will be distributed with the HESSI data base, to serve as a multi-parameter
index and overview of the data base and to provide data products to users
not requiring custom analyses. <a href="Science.html#Table D-4">Table D-4

<h2>
<a NAME="data_flow"></a><DFN>Data Flow and Distribution</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The data flow will follow the FAST model that was designed to minimize
interfaces and the production of extensive secondary data bases. Data will
be telemetered directly from the spacecraft to the MOC/SOC at UCB, where
the raw telemetry files will be reformatted into the primary data base.
This includes the following principal elements: time-tagged photons, SAS
and RAS data, and housekeeping data. Health, safety, and status are confirmed
using automated algorithms at this stage. As with FAST, to ensure prompt
preparation, the primary data base is generated without routine operator
intervention and with no value added except for the addition of "catalog"
information. This will include pointers to make the primary data base appear
as a sequence of time-ordered, non-duplicated, and quality-flagged data,
a summary of spacecraft/instrument status, detector rates above representative
energy thresholds, and orbital averages of full-resolution spectra.</DFN>
<p><DFN>For solar events, sets of representative images and spatially integrated
spectra will be generated using robust algorithms for inclusion in the
catalog. The primary data base and catalog will be made available by network
access using a CD-ROM jukebox, and will be shipped to GSFC and ETH on CD-ROMs
daily.</DFN>
<p><DFN>At GSFC, the HESSI solar data analysis, distribution, and archiving
tasks will be conducted under the auspices of the Solar Data Analysis Center
(SDAC). We will take full advantage of the SDAC facilities and experienced
personnel developed through the coordinated analysis of data from SMM,
Yohkoh, CGRO, and SOHO. In addition to HESSI data, the SDAC will also maintain
a database of other relevant spacecraft and ground-based observations.</DFN>
<p><DFN>A detailed data time line is given in
<a href="Science.html#Table D-5">Table
D-5</a>. The primary data base and the quick-look data products will be
available on line, typically within 24 hours of receipt at UCB. All data
products, including the latest analysis software and calibration data,
will be shipped to the NSSDC on high-density magnetic tape for archiving
within 2 months of real time.</DFN>

<h2>
<a NAME="s/w"></a><DFN>Software Development</DFN></h2>
<DFN>The overall HESSI ground software development task can be divided
into three areas:</DFN>
<ol>
<li>
<DFN>Software for prelaunch system-level testing and post-launch operations.
Its purpose is primarily command generation, status display, and generation
of the primary data base. This software will be developed at UCB based
on FAST.</DFN></li>

<li>
<DFN>Prelaunch software associated with subsystem testing and calibration,
developed by the group responsible for the corresponding subsystem.</DFN></li>

<li>
<DFN>Post-launch analysis software will be coordinated at GSFC, where careful
attention will be paid to optimizing user and data interfaces across the
different elements.</DFN></li>
</ol>
<DFN>A software toolbox will be developed to carry out all aspects of the
data analysis including the generation of the data products listed in
<a href="Science.html#Table D-4">Table
D-4</a>. For the most "interesting" computational task, namely image formation
from the list of photons, there are several options, all of which have
been developed or demonstrated. Each technique has its advantages, with
the optimum choice in any situation depending on such issues as photon
statistics, computing time restrictions, and map parameters. These techniques
include direct Fourier inversion, back projection, maximum entropy, pixon
methods, and model fitting.</DFN>
<p><DFN>We have allocated substantial resources to the software development
effort to ensure that the data analysis tools will be fully debugged, documented,
and tested prior to launch. Our language of choice is IDL. It is easily
maintained, well suited to rapid development, can operate seamlessly on
many different platforms, and is widely used throughout the solar and astrophysical
communities (e.g., Yohkoh and CGRO), allowing us to take advantage of the
significant investment in a large body of pre-existing software.</DFN>
