SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
This disc is readable on any computing platform that has standard DVD driver software installed. The minimum software requirements are a Web browser, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and a text editor. A GIS or image processing software program (such as Arc Map) will allow user to open and view Derived Temperature Anomalies and Color Infrared Imagery GeoTIFF files.

PROJECT SUMMARY

Temperature anomalies in coastal waters were detected with Thermal Infrared imagery of the Lower Suwannee River (LSR) and nearshore tidal marshes on Florida Gulf Coast. Imagery included 1.5-m-resolution day and night Thermal Infrared (TIR) and 0.75-m-resolution Color Infrared (CIR) imagery acquired on 2-3 March 2005. Coincident temperature readings were collected on the ground and used to calibrate the imagery. The Floridan aquifer is at or near the land surface in this area and bears a constant temperature signature of ~ 22 degrees Celsius. This consistent temperature contrasts sharply with ambient temperatures during winter and summer months. Temperature anomalies identified in the imagery during a late-winter cold spell may be correlated with aquifer seeps. Hot spots were identified as those areas exceeding ambient water temperature by 4 degrees Celsius or more. Warm-water plumes were also mapped for both day and night imagery. The plume from Manatee Spring, a first-order magnitude spring, influenced water temperature in the lower river. Numerous temperature anomalies were identified in small tributaries and tidal creeks from Shired Island to Cedar Key and were confirmed with field reconnaissance. Abundant warm-water features were identified along tidal creeks south of the Suwannee River and near Waccasassa Bay. Features were mapped in the tidal creeks north of the river but appear to be less common or have lower associated discharge. The imagery shows considerable promise in mapping coastal-aquifer seeps and understanding the underlying geology of the region. Detection of seep locations may aid research in groundwater/surface-water interactions and water quality, and in the management of coastal habitats.

DVD ORGANIZATION
There are five top-level directory and two top-level files contained on this DVD-ROM. The top-level files are:

1.) index.html - This file is intended to be the starting point for DVD-ROM access.

2.) readme.txt - This file contains a description of this DVD-ROM.

The top-level directories are:

1.) Directory html\ - This directory contains html files needed to properly display the content of the disk. One subdirectory contains all images used to create the display (for example: the USGS logo, study area). 

2.) Directory OFR-2007-1311\ - This directory contains Open-File Report stored as an interactive pdf and 508 compliant file. User should start from OFR-2007-1311 and move between the figures, photos and text. Figure 2 is an interactive map at 1:50000 scale, and 33.11/46.8 inches printable size.
Hints to use the interactive map: use hand tool to move and zoom to the area of interest.  Explore location of hot spots and warm-water plumes. Suggested maximum zoom is 200%.
 
 
3.) Directory Derived_Features\ - This directory contains the features derived from TIR as five separate georeferenced raster files.
Derived Temperature Anomalies section contains five single-band GeoTIFF files (suw_am_hot.tif, suw_pm_hot.tif, suw_ampm_warm.tif, suw_am_plume.tif, suw_pm_plume.tif) at 3m resolution.
To view derived temperature anomalies in Arc Map follow these steps: [This is an example for “suw_am_hot.tif” layer, but all other layers can be treated the same way.] 
1: Open Arc Map, 2: Add Suw_am_hot.tif layer, 3: Double click on suw_am_hot.tif in table of contents and go to PROPERTIES, 4: Go to SYMBOLOGY, change display to CLASSFIED, 5: Change color for zero to no color and change zero-ten to desired color 6: View layers simultaneously by loading the five images as layers in Arc Map and changing the display to ~30-50% transparency under properties for each image, 7:Use the values in parentheses for each layer: suw_am_hot.tif (value 10), suw_pm_hot.tif (values 20 and 70), suw_pm_plume.tif (value 30), suw_am_plume.tif (40), suw_ampm_warm.tif (value 50).

4.) Directory CIR\ - This directory contains CIR images for study area.

4a.) Subdirectory 12_CIR\ - This subdirectory contains 12 CIR images at 0.75 m resolution.

4b.) Subdirectory Mosaic\ - This subdirectory contains two mosaic images of the study area at 3 m resolution: 3-band color infrared and single layer black-and-white image.

5.) Directory Metadata\ - This directory contains metadata files in XML and txt formats for TIR derived feature and CIR.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Imagery was acquired in cooperation with Sarah Kruse (University of South Florida). Lower Suwannee NWR personnel and Jeff DiMaggio (Park Manager, Waccasassa Bay Preserve State Park) provided field and ground support. David Stonehouse (VeriMap) provided the initial ‘proof-of-concept’ flight and expert advice.
