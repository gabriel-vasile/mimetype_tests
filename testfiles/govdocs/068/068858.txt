                        NEA/RSIC Personnel Exchange
                                       
   Enrico Sartori, of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Data Bank
  in Paris, arrived on Monday, January 10, 1994, for an 8-week
  assignment with the Radiation Shielding Information Center.
  Enrico is in charge of the computer program services for the NEA
  Data Bank, which serves western European countries, and Japan.
  RSIC has had a long and beneficial collaboration with Data Bank
  staff over the years. The NEA and the U.S. Department of Energy
  (DOE) have an arrangement for the exchange of technical software
  and data between the NEA Data Bank and RSIC, which includes the
  exchange of personnel. We have had few chances for extended
  exchanges in the past, but hope that these can be done more
  frequently in the future. Since the two Centers have similar
  missions and programs, the visit will offer an opportunity to
  coordinate shared procedures. 
   The objectives of this exchange are: (1) to improve
  implementation of the cooperative arrangement through discussion,
  identification, and implementation of common standards in the
  computer program exchange and; (2) to work with Engineering
  Physics and Mathematics Division personnel on the Radiation
  Shielding Experiment Data Base, a program of the Nuclear Science
  Committee to coordinate the collection and preservation of
  essential and comprehensive data sets from experiments carried
  out on radiation shielding facilities. The data will be stored in
  a computerized data base for easy retrieval by the radiation
  shielding community for validating shield design and analysis
  tools.
   Sartori will use this period to finalize the plans for
  meetings being jointly organized with RSIC. He will also
  participate with members of the Computing Applications Division
  in studies of the NEA Criticality Safety Working Group.

  This code system for neutron flux spectra determination by
  multiple foil activation using the iterative method has been
  updated by RSIC. The SAND-II executable file was recreated to
  bind the runtime modules with the Phar Lap DOS extender.  The
  release for personal computers, contributed by Experimental and
  Mathematical Physics Consultants, Gaithersburg, Maryland, is a
  conversion of RSIC's C00112/I3675/00 SAND-II release, which was
  last modified in August 1977. The Lahey F77L-EM/32 compiler,
  Version 5.01, was used to create the executables included in the
  package, which run on 80386 or 80486 personal computers equipped
  with a math coprocessor. The package is transmitted on one DS/HD
  5.25-in. (1.2 MB) diskette in self-extracting compressed DOS
  files. References: AFWL-TR-67-41 (Sept. 1967), BNWL-855 (Aug.

  Format: tar, DOS
  
  
  This general purpose Monte Carlo code system developed at Los
  Alamos National Laboratory for calculating the time-dependent
  continuous-energy transport of neutrons, photons, and/or
  electrons in three-dimensional geometries has been updated to
  include the ENDF/B-IV derived cross sections which were included
  in previous distributions of MCNP.  These data libraries were
  omitted from the initial RSIC release of MCNP4A; and users who
  have already received this new release and need these files may
  contact RSIC to obtain the data, which are unchanged from the
  MCNP 4.2 release.  MCNP4A is designed for MS-DOS PCs, Unix (Sun,
  HP, IBM RS/6000, SGI, DEC), Cray (UNICOS, COS, CTSS), and DEC
  (VMS).  The DLC-105 package to which no changes have been made
  since the release of MCNP 4.2 includes ENDF/B-V derived libraries
  and is available upon request to users within the US.  
   MCNP4A is available in UNIX tar format on cartridge tape or
  on 29 3.5-in. DS/HD (1.44 MB) diskettes in self-extracting
  compressed DOS files.  In addition to the source files, MCNP4A
  executables are included for personal computer users. These were
  created on a PC/486 under DOS 6.0 using the Lahey Fortran F77L3-
  EM/32 Version 5.10 compiler.  Reference: LA-12625 (1993). Fortran

  Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, has
  notified RSIC of a correction which should be made to this
  integrated TIGER series of coupled electron/photon Monte Carlo
  transport codes, Version 3. In labeled common TEMP, the array
  MTAX(15) is specified.  This array should be specified as
  MTAX(INTAB).  INTAB is the maximum number of tables allowed to
  specify the photon cross sections for a given material.  If there
  are more than 14 edge energies in a material, this array will be
  referenced out of range and can lead to a fatal error that may be
  difficult to debug.  Users should contact RSIC for a copy of the
  letter for additional information.  References:  SAND91-1634

  Oak Ridge National Laboratory contributed a newly frozen version
  of this two- and three-dimensional discrete ordinates transport
  code system.  The new release, designated TORT 2.8.14, includes
  many small improvements and corrections and now runs on Sun, Dec,
  and HP workstations in addition to Cray and IBM RISC 6000
  computers.  New codes TORSED and TORSET have been added to
  construct TORT boundary sources from external DORT or TORT flux
  files. The PC version was not updated and is version 2.7.3. The
  code system is transmitted either on tape cartridge in tar format
  or on four DS/HD 3.5-in. (1.44 MB) diskettes in self-extracting
  compressed DOS files.  References:  ORNL-6268 (Nov. 1987), ORNL-

  CHANGES TO THE DATA LIBRARY COLLECTION
                  
   Two changes were made to the data library collection during
  the month. A new data library was added to the collection and an
  existing data library was replaced with a newly frozen version.
  One changed resulted from a foreign contribution.

  The International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria,
  contributed a newly frozen version of this International Reactor
  Dosimetry File, Version 2, for reactor neutron dosimetry by foil
  activation.  It also contains selected recommended values for
  benchmark neutron spectra and radiation damage cross sections. 
  This supersedes all earlier versions of IRDF and includes
  corrections and additions to covariance files and dosimetry
  reactions.  The data in the original ENDF-6 format were processed
  to 640-group extended SANDII format in the Nuclear Data Section
  of the IAEA using the processing codes LINEAR, RECENT, and
  GROUPIE by D. E. Cullen. The covariance information is not
  processed by these codes and is contained in IRDF-90 in the
  original ENDF-6 format. The data are transmitted on one DS/HD
  diskette in self-extracting compressed DOS files.  References:

  DLC-167/FGR-DOSE
  OP SYS: DOS     
  Language:   Fortran  
  Computers: All  
  Format: DOS
  
  
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory contributed this data library of
  dose coefficients for both intakes and external exposures to
  radionuclides from Federal Guidance Reports 11 and 12.  Dose
  coefficients for radionuclide intake (dose per unit activity
  inhaled or ingested) in FGR 11 were abstracted from the ICRP and
  the ORNL dosimetric data files assembled during the preparation
  of Publication 30 of the ICRP.  The dose coefficients for
  external exposure (dose per unit radionuclide concentration) in
  FGR 12 are based on new calculations of the radiation field for
  nuclides distributed in environment.  A data retrieval program
  READEM illustrates the manner the dose coefficient files might be
  accessed by other software.  This program was compiled and linked
  using MS Fortran 5.0 under DOS 6.2.  The package is transmitted
  on one DS/HD 5.25-in. (1.2 MB) diskette in self-extracting
  compressed DOS files.  References:  EPA 402-R-93-081 (Sept. 1993)
