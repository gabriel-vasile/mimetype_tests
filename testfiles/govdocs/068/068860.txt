NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE 
Adopted: February 29, 2008 Released: February 29, 2008 
By the Commission: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture (“NAL”),1 we find that Horizon Telecom, 
Inc. (“Horizon” or “Company”) apparently willfully or repeatedly violated sections 201(b) and 258 of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended2 (“Communications Act” or “Act”), and sections 1.717, 
64.1120, and 64.1130 of the Commission’s rules.3 As discussed in more detail herein, Horizon has 
apparently willfully or repeatedly failed to respond on a timely basis to twenty-one (21) informal 
complaints served on it by the Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau (“CGB”). In addition, it 
apparently changed the preferred carriers of one hundred twenty-five (125) consumers without proper 
authorization, a practice commonly known as “slamming.”4 Based upon our review of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding these apparent violations, we propose a monetary forfeiture of $5,084,000 
against Horizon for the apparent violations described herein. 
2. Horizon’s apparent violations are discussed individually in detail below. However, we 
provide a brief background to the investigation. Horizon is a Las Vegas-based company that provides 
long distance calling services. The Commission has been monitoring Horizon’s activities due to the 
quantity and nature of informal complaints received by CGB and state public utility commissions and 
Attorneys General offices. The Enforcement Bureau (“EB”) sent Horizon a Letter of Inquiry (“LOI”) 
on June 28, 2007, directing the company to answer a number of inquiries regarding its business 
1 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1). The Commission has the authority under this section of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended to assess a forfeiture against any person who has “willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any of 
the provisions of this Act or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission under this Act ….”

practices and compliance with various Commission rules. 5 Horizon provided a partial response on July 
27, 2007 (“response”) 6 and supplemented its response on September 19, 2007 (“supplemental 
response”).7 
II. DISCUSSION 
A. Failure to Respond to Commission Directive 
1. Background 
3. CGB’s informal complaint process provides an avenue for consumers to have their 
complaints and inquiries addressed through informal mediation and resolution by CGB with the carrier. 
CGB addresses informal complaints against carriers by serving the complaint on the carrier and 
requiring from the carrier within thirty days a written response discussing the satisfaction of the 
complaint or the carrier’s refusal or inability to satisfy the complaint. Specifically, pursuant to section 
1.717: 
The Commission will forward informal complaints to the appropriate carrier for 
investigation. The carrier will, within such time as may be prescribed, advise the 
Commission in writing, with a copy to the complainant, of its satisfaction of the 
complaint or its refusal or inability to do so. Where there are clear indications from the 
carrier’s report or from other communications with the parties that the complaint has 
been satisfied the Commission may in its discretion, consider a complaint proceeding to 
be closed, without response to the complainant. In all other cases, the Commission will 
contact the complainant regarding its review and disposition of the matters raised. If the 
complainant is not satisfied by the carrier’s response and the Commission’s disposition, it 
may file a formal complaint in accordance with §1.721 of this part.8 
4. Pursuant to this process, CGB served on Horizon twenty-one (21) informal complaints.9 
Further, the Commission on March 2, 2007, reminded carriers of the importance of responding to

informal complaints, and the seriousness of the penalties for failure to do so.10 Horizon has failed to 
respond in a timely manner to these twenty-one informal complaints. To date, Horizon has not 
responded to twelve of the complaints,11and responded at least two months late to the remaining nine 
complaints.12 
2. Discussion 
5. Sections 4(i), 4(j), 218, and 403 of the Act afford the Commission broad authority to 
investigate the entities it regulates.13 Section 4(i) authorizes the Commission to “issue such orders, not 
inconsistent with this Act, as may be necessary in the execution of its functions,” and section 4(j) states 
that “the Commission may conduct its proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper 
dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.”14 Section 218 of the Act specifically authorizes the 
Commission to “obtain from . . . carriers . . . full and complete information necessary to enable the 
Commission to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created.”15 Section 403 of 
the Act grants the Commission “full authority and power at any time to institute an inquiry, on its own 
motion . . . relating to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act.”16 Finally, section 1.717 of 
our rules requires the Commission to forward informal complaints to the appropriate carriers and 
requires a written response from the carrier within thirty days.17 
6. We find that Horizon apparently violated section 1.717 of the Commission’s rules by 
failing to timely respond to the above-referenced twenty-one informal complaints served by CGB. The 
Commission on March 2, 2007, expressly reminded carriers of their regulatory obligations to respond to

Timely Respond to Informal Complaints, DA 07-989 (March 2, 2007).

12 See IC#s 07-S001530 (sent to Horizon 3/9/07, response received 6/29/07), 07-S0267711 (sent to Horizon 3/6/07, 
response received 6/29/07), 07-S0270717 (sent to Horizon 3/30/07, response received 6/29/07), 07-S0270921 (sent 
to Horizon 3/29/07, response received 6/29/07), 07-S001517 (sent to Horizon 2/2/07, response received 6/29/07), 
07-S0263454 (sent to Horizon 2/2/07, response received 6/29/07), 07-S0257121 (sent to Horizon 2/8/07, response 
received 6/29/07), 07-S0262341 (sent to Horizon 1/26/07, response received 6/29/07), 07-S0266294 (sent to 
Horizon 2/21/07, response received 6/11/07). We note that, although CGB has served other complaints on Horizon 
that the Company has not responded to in a timely fashion, we exercise our discretion not to assess a forfeiture for 
those late-filed responses because we only recently made clear our intent to enforce more strictly our response time 
frame as set forth by section 1.717 of the Commission’s rules, and because those late-filed responses were not filed 
as far beyond the filing time frame as those for which we do assess a forfeiture. We caution Horizon and other 
carriers that, as we made clear in our March 2, 2007 Public Notice, we expect timely responses to informal 
complaints, and we will take a hard look at late-filed responses in subsequent actions.

informal complaints in a timely fashion, and the seriousness of the penalties for failure to do so.18 
Nevertheless, Horizon has not timely responded to the informal complaints referenced herein. Of the 
twenty-one complaints at issue, Horizon failed to respond to twelve. Moreover, Horizon’s responses to 
the nine remaining complaints were filed not only beyond thirty days of service, the time frame in 
which Horizon was given to respond in all of these informal responses, but also beyond that March 
2007 Public Notice. We conclude that Horizon apparently willfully or repeatedly violated a 
Commission rule by failing to timely provide a written response in response to twenty-one informal 
complaints. Accordingly, a proposed forfeiture is warranted against Horizon for this apparent willful or 
repeated violation. 
B. Slamming Violations 
1. Background 
7. Section 258 of the Act prohibits the practice of “slamming,” the submission or execution of 
an unauthorized change in a subscriber’s selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or 
telephone toll service (“preferred carrier”).19 Section 258 of the Act makes it unlawful for any 
telecommunications carrier to “submit or execute a change in a subscriber's selection of a provider of 
telephone exchange service or telephone toll service except in accordance with such procedures as the 
Commission shall prescribe.”20 In December 1998, the Commission released the Section 258 Order in 
which it adopted rules to implement Section 258.21 In the Section 258 Order, the Commission adopted 
aggressive rules designed to take the profit out of slamming, broadened the scope of the slamming rules 
to encompass all carriers, and modified its existing requirements for the authorization and verification 
of preferred carrier changes. 
8. The rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent 
before a carrier change may occur.22 Section 64.1120 of the Commission’s rules prescribes that no 
carrier “shall submit a change on the behalf of a subscriber . . . prior to obtaining: (i) Authorization 
from the subscriber, and (ii) Verification of that authorization in accordance with the procedures

slamming problem. See, e.g., Policies and Rules Concerning Unauthorized Changes of Consumers' Long Distance 
Carriers, CC Docket No. 94-129, Report and Order, 10 FCC Rcd 9560 (1995), stayed in part, 11 FCC Rcd 856

prescribed in this section.”23 Specifically, a carrier must: (1) obtain the subscriber's written or 
electronically signed authorization in a format that meets the requirements of section 64.1130; (2) 
obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of 
confirming orders electronically; or (3) utilize an independent third party to verify the subscriber's 
order.24 
9. Of particular relevance here is section 64.1130 which details the requirements for the letter 
of agency (“LOA”) form and content for written or electronically signed authorizations.25 Section 
64.1130(b) requires that the LOA “be a separate document (or an easily separable document) or located 
on a separate screen or webpage containing only the authorizing language described in paragraph (e) of 
[section 64.1130] having the sole purpose of authorizing a telecommunications carrier to initiate a 
preferred carrier change. The letter of agency must be signed and dated by the subscriber to the 
telephone line(s) requesting the preferred carrier change.”26 The rule further mandates that the LOA 
“shall not be combined on the same document, screen, or webpage with inducements of any kind.”27 
The rule details the basic requirements for the LOA, including the size and readability of type, and 
certain minimum content requirements.28 
a. Discussion 
10. Each of the one hundred twenty-five (125) consumers who filed complaints that form the 
basis of this NAL maintain that they did not authorize Horizon to change their preferred carriers, but 
that Horizon nevertheless changed their preferred carriers to Horizon.29 Horizon states that 
authorization was received and confirmed when a letter of agency was signed and processed.30 We find 
that Horizon has failed to produce a preponderance of evidence that the complainants authorized a 
carrier change.31 Therefore, we find that Horizon’s actions apparently resulted in an unauthorized 
change in each complainant’s telecommunications service provider. 
11. In its response to the LOI, Horizon states that it markets through an “Internet marketing 
campaign” and telemarketing, and that it terminated both marketing programs prior to its receipt of the 
LOI.32 The Company submitted copies of its Internet LOA, and its telemarketing script and verification 
23 Id. § 64.1120(a)(1). 
24 See 47 C.F.R. § 64.1120(c). For those carriers that use an independent third party for verification, our rules 
require that the verification method confirm at least six things: the identity of the subscriber; confirmation that the 
person on the call is authorized to make the carrier change; confirmation that the person on the call wants to make 
the change; the names of the carriers affected by the change; the telephone numbers to be switched; and the types of 
service involved. Our rules also require that carriers keep audio records of the verification for a minimum of two 
years. 47 C.F.R. § 64.1120. Finally, the Commission's rules require that when a carrier "is selling more than one 
type of telecommunications service … that carrier must obtain separate authorization from the subscriber for each 
service sold … Each authorization must be verified separately from any other authorizations obtained in the same 
solicitation.” 47 C.F.R. § 21.1120(b).

script. We have reviewed the LOA submitted by Horizon, and find that Horizon’s LOA contains an 
inducement in apparent violation of our rules,33 despite Horizon’s claim that its LOA “ensures that 
customers are properly solicited…the Letter of Authorization contains no marketing materials.”34 In 
particular, every LOA provided by Horizon contains not only acceptable authorizing language and 
disclosures, but also the following inducement: “[a]nd as an added BONUS, you will receive 2 FREE 
Roundtrip Airline Tickets Certificate from Executive Tour and Travel!” (emphasis in original).35 As 
noted above, our rules specifically prohibit LOAs from being combined with any inducements on the 
same “document, screen, or webpage.”36 Further, the LOA appears to lack a means or location for 
consumers to provide their electronic signature, as required by our rules.37 Accordingly, any preferred 
carrier change submitted by Horizon pursuant to the LOA it provided in response to the LOI apparently 
violates our rules on its face and thus constitutes a slam. We conclude that Horizon apparently willfully 
or repeatedly violated a Commission rule by submitting carrier change orders without proper 
authorization in accordance with our rules and section 258 of the Act of every consumer listed in 
Appendix I. Accordingly, a proposed forfeiture is warranted against Horizon for this apparent willful 
or repeated violation. 
III. FORFEITURE AMOUNT 
12. Under section 503(b)(1) of the Act, any person who is determined by the Commission to 
have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or 
order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty.38 Section 
312(f)(1) of the Act defines “willful” as “the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of [any] 
act, irrespective of any intent to violate” the law.39 The legislative history to section 312(f)(1) of the 
Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both sections 312 and 503(b) of the Act,40 and the 
Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503(b) context.41 The Commission also may 
assess a forfeiture for violations that are merely repeated, and not willful.42 “Repeated” means that the 
act was committed or omitted more than once, or lasts more than one day.43 To impose such a 
33 See 47 C.F.R. § 64.1130(c). 
34 See supplemental response at 2. 
35 The LOA also includes the following language: “Horizon Telecom, Inc. is not owned or affiliated with Executive 
Tour and Travel, who is solely responsible for the fulfillment of the 2 free roundtrip airline tickets…TRAVELER IS 
ENTITLED TO TWO COMPLIMENTARY ROUND TRIP AIRLINE TICKETS, WHEN STAYING AT ONE OF 
THE PARTIPATING HOTELS OR CONDOS FOR A MINIMUM NUMBER OF NIGHTS AND PAYING 
STANDARD RATES. TRAVELER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOTEL AND AIR DEPARTURE TAXES. AIR,

forfeiture penalty, the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability and the person against 
whom the notice has been issued must have an opportunity to show, in writing, why no such forfeiture 
penalty should be imposed.44 The Commission will then issue a forfeiture if it finds by a preponderance 
of the evidence that the person has willfully or repeatedly violated the Act or a Commission order or 
rule.45 
13. Section 503(b)(2)(B) of the Act authorizes the Commission to assess a forfeiture of up to 
$130,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, up to a statutory maximum of 
$1,325,000 for a single act or failure to act.46 In determining the appropriate forfeiture amount, we 
consider the factors enumerated in section 503(b)(2)(D) of the Act, including “the nature, 
circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the degree of 
culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may 
require.”47 As provided by the Commission’s rules, the Commission and its staff retain the discretion to 
issue a higher or lower forfeiture, as permitted by statute.48 
14. Horizon will have an opportunity to submit further evidence and arguments in response to 
this NAL to show that no forfeiture should be imposed or that some lesser amount should be assessed.49 
A. Proposed Forfeiture for Horizon’s Failures to Respond 
15. Section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules and the Commission’s Forfeiture Policy 
Statement establish a base forfeiture amount of and $4,000 for failure to respond to a Commission 
communication.50 Horizon’s failure to timely respond to the twenty-one (21) informal complaints 
served by CGB warrants the base forfeiture amount of $4,000 for each apparent violation, for a 
proposed forfeiture of eighty-four thousand dollar ($84,000). 
16. We also direct Horizon to respond to the remaining twelve informal complaints within 
thirty (30) days of the release of this order. Failure to do so may constitute an additional violation 
potentially subjecting Horizon to further penalties, including potentially higher monetary forfeitures, 
the revocation of operating authority, and the disqualification of any Horizon principal from the 
provision of any common carrier services without the prior consent of the Commission.51

B. Proposed Forfeiture for Horizon’s Slamming Violations 
17. The Commission's forfeiture guidelines currently establish a standard forfeiture amount of 
$40,000 for violations of our rules and orders regarding unauthorized changes of preferred 
interexchange carriers.52 On several occasions, the Commission has sternly warned carriers that it 
would take swift and decisive enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary 
forfeitures, against any carrier found to have engaged in slamming.53 We therefore find that Horizon is 
apparently liable for a forfeiture of $40,000 for each of the one hundred and twenty-five (125) 
unauthorized preferred carrier changes, for a total forfeiture of five million dollars ($5,000,000). 
IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDERING CLAUSES 
18. We have determined that Horizon Telecom, Inc. has apparently willfully or repeatedly 
violated sections 201(b) and 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,54 and sections 1.717, 
64.1120, and 64.1130 of the Commission’s rules.55 Horizon has apparently willfully and repeatedly 
failed to timely respond to twenty-one (21) informal complaints served on it by CGB and submitted 
changes of the preferred carriers of one hundred twenty-five (125) consumers without their proper 
authorization, for a total propose forfeiture of $5,084,000 dollars. 
19. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to section 503(b) of Communications Act of 
1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 503(b), section 1.80 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.80, that 
Horizon Telecom. Inc. IS HEREBY NOTIFIED of an Apparent Liability for Forfeiture in the amount 
of $5,084,000 for willful or repeated violations of sections 201(b) and 258 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. §§ 201 
and 258, and sections 1.717, 64.1120, and 64.1130 of the Commission’s rules and orders as described 
above.56
20. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to section 1.80 of the Commission’s Rules, 
within thirty days of the release date of this NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY, Horizon Telecom, 
Inc. SHALL PAY the full amount of the proposed forfeiture or SHALL FILE a written statement

D.C. 20554, ATTN: Enforcement Bureau –Telecommunications Consumers Division, and must include 
the NAL/Acct. No. referenced in the caption. 
21. The Commission will not consider reducing or canceling a forfeiture in response to a claim 
of inability to pay unless the petitioner submits: (1) federal tax returns for the most recent three-year 
period; (2) financial statements prepared according to generally accepted accounting practices 
(“GAAP”); or (3) some other reliable and objective documentation that accurately reflects the 
petitioner’s current financial status. Any claim of inability to pay must specifically identify the basis 
for the claim by reference to the financial documentation submitted.
