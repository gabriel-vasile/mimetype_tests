Current ENE Stock Positions of

Little Value to Enron

• Equity transaction below the line.

• Book up of equity does not increase debt capacity; Enron is funds flow constrained.

• Debt to buy back shares would hurt Enron's credit profile / rating.

• Sale of shares would depress stock price.

• Best scenario: Net settle option increases EPS approximately $0.015.

DEAL DESCRIPTION
El proposes to invest $20.8 MM for 50% of the common equity in Palestine Electric Company PLC ("PEC"), a public
shareholding company registered in and organized pursuant to the laws of the Palestinian National Authority ("PNA"). PEC
will build, own and operate a 136 MW combined-cycle power plant in Gaza, Palestine. PEC has entered into a power
purchase agreement with the Palestinian Energy Authority ("PEA"). PEA is the public authority responsible for the purchase,
transmission, distribution, dispatch, and sale of electricity in the PNA Territories of Gaza and the West Bank. PEA is an
agency of the PNA.

The PPA term is 20 years starting from the commercial operations date. PEA has the option to extend the PPA for two
additional 5-year terms. Currently, PEA is importing all of Gaza's power needs from Israel. The PEC plant will be the first
IPP in Gaza and will displace imported power from Israel. PEC will have an exclusive right for 20 years to all future Gaza
power generation. All the payments under the PPA will be made in US Dollars.

The power plant will consist of four ABB GT10-B2 gas turbines and two steam turbines that will run on distillate fuel. Both
the plant and the PPA provide the flexibility to switch to natural gas, if it becomes available in the future. The construction of
the plant will be done by ABB on a fixed price turnkey basis. The anticipated commercial operation dates ("COD") are July
2000 for the simple-cycle gas turbine and July 2001 for the whole combined-cycle plant.

The total project cost is estimated to be $138.5 MM, and is expected to be financed at a 70/30 debt to equity ratio. The model
assumes a bridge loan will be in place at the time construction begins. EI has had preliminary discussions with Arab Bank
regarding the bridge loan. Permanent, non-recourse financing is likely to come from the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation ("OPIC") with a term of 12 years from COD. EI is pursuing other permanent financing alternatives as well. It is
expected that OPIC also will provide political risk insurance for EI's equity that will cover contract frustration, expropriation,
currency inconvertibility, and political violence risks. OPIC brought and enthusiastically recommended the project to Enron.
The partner in PEC is PEC Holdings, a partnership between various Palestinian-Arab interests including Consolidated
Contractors Company, Arab Bank, Al Akkad Group, Arab Palestinian Investment Holding Co. ("APIC"), the Palestinian
Government, and Palestinian Development and Investment Ltd ("PADICO"). PEC intends to sell equity via an IPO or private
placement at par value in the local Nablus Stock Exchange in the near term. After the IPO, El, PEC Holdings, and the public
shareholders will each own 33.3% of the economic interest in PEC. Control of the PEC will be shared equally between El and
PEC Holdings.

Palestine Overview: Please see attachment

ASSOCIATED GUARANTEES
None. However, the bridge loan is likely to necessitate parent guarantees, in which case El or Enron Corp. may need to
provide a guarantee for the financing needed until the closing of non-recourse permanent financing. In the event the project is
unable to obtain bridge financing, El is requesting that the Office of the Chairman be delegated the authority to approve an
Enron Corp. bridge financing and/or credit enhancement (including guarantees of bridge financing) for up to 50% of the total
project costs.

HEDGEABLE OR MARKET RISKS
Following are market-based risks that should be monitored and for which hedges should be considered:

Foreign Exchange Risk	All revenues are in USD. Enron is indirectly taking currency risk in that PNA has limited
ability to generate USD. Business transactions in Palestine are conducted using the New
Israeli Shekel (NIS), US Dollar, or the Jordanian Dinar. In the event that the PNA does not
have enough USD, Enron will be faced with the decision of accepting a foreign currency or
declaring an event of default.
A portion of the EPC contract and the major maintenance costs are in Swedish kroners and a
portion of the operating costs are in NIS. ECT's currency desk has provided forward curves
for the shekel and the kroner. No currency hedges are in place.
Credit Risk	PEC ultimately is exposed to PNA's credit since PNA is guaranteeing all of PEA's payment
	obligations under the PPA. Neither PEA nor PNA have public credit ratings. PEA does not
	have a long credit history. PEA's only alternative for electricity is from Israel, which is
	interruptible, likely more expensive, and politically unpopular. PEA has a good recent credit
	history of payment to Israel for comparable amounts of electricity. PNA has the right to levy
	and collect taxes.
	PNA currently is fighting an order by the Federal District Court in Washington to pay $18.7
	million in damages for canceling a 1993 contract with International Technologies Integration, a
	Virginia-based communications firm, to set up the first Palestinian phone company. ITI
	initially was awarded the concession, but Yasser Arafat cancelled the deal and awarded it to
	PADICO (Palestine Development and Investment Company).
	Under the PPA, PEA will provide PEC a $20 MM letter of credit, which covers approximately
	7 months of capacity payments. PEA also will provide an escrow arrangement for PEC where
	PEC (via an escrow bank) effectively will collect all payments directly from the end user.
	The OPIC insurance is expected to included contract frustration, which covers PNA non-
	payment. However, Enron would have to win an arbitration award before it could collect on
	the insurance.
	No credit derivatives market exists which could be used to hedge the credit risk in this
	transaction.
Interest Rate Risk	Enrpn is exposed to interest rate movements before financial close to the extent that they would
	affect the determination of the interest rate on debt. For model purposes an all-in fixed interest
	rate is assumed to apply to the $104MM of 12-year project debt. Preliminary financing terms

	indicate pricing at a fixed rate based on a spread above Treasuries at financial close.
Equity Risk	The equity risk is captured in the discount rate. This transaction is strategic. Therefore, market
	comparables are not applicable.
Inflation Risk	Inflation will impact future SGA and O&M expenses. The equity holders are exposed if the
	rate of inflation is greater than the 3% escalation used in determining fixed future capacity
	payments. The inflation of CAPEX costs will be covered by ABB in accordance with the EPC
	contract.
Commodity Risk	PEC is not assuming any commodity exposure/risk.

Country Report

PALESTINE (GAZA & WEST BANK)

The following paper presents an overview of Palestine's history as well as its political and economic
environment.

I. Introduction

Palestine is located in the heart of the Middle
East, on the Eastern Shore of the Mediterranean
Sea. Areas currently under the political control
of the Palestinian National Authority include
portions of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

In the first years after the Oslo Accords (1993),
expectations for massive investment in the
Palestinian controlled areas were enormous. And
following the 1995 Paris Accords on economic
relations, people believed the legal environment
would improve, risks would diminish and donor
countries would extend their aid.

After the 1996 assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and the subsequent election of
Benjamin Netanyahu, the international
community lost confidence in the progress of the
peace process and the likelihood of increased
stability in the area. Israeli-imposed border
closures froze the movement of people and
goods and halted the Palestinian economy.
6,000 companies have registered with the
Palestinian Authority for business licenses but
few of them are actually operating. Public funds
have also been slow to arrive; to date the
Palestinian Authority has only received about
50% of $2.4 billion in aid originally pledged by
some 40 countries.

Since 1993, the Palestinian economy has
degenerated rather than improved. A decline in
household income, a sharp increase in
unemployment, and the general broadening of
poverty poses serious challenges for economic

II. Historical Background

sustainability. In November 1998, there were
still 184 villages in the West Bank and Gaza
without drinking water and 88 without
electricity.

Israel still has total control of Palestine's borders
with Egypt and Jordan, and imposes strict
controls on what Palestinians may import or
export. However, it is expected that the recently
elected Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, will
foster the peace process in the near future.

Functioning as a Palestinian government, though not yet recognized as a nation, the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964 as a political body representing the Palestinians in their efforts to
reclaim their country from the Israelis (Yasser Arafat has been the head of the PLO since 1968).

During the war of 1966-67, Israel gained control of Egypt's the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, Syria's
Golan Heights, and West Bank of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem.

In November 1988, at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council in Algiers, Arafat announced the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. One month later, the United
States agreed to begin direct contact with the PLO.

On September 13, 1993, Israel and the PLO signed a Declaration of Principles (DOP) in Washington. The
DOP established an ambitious set of objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim
Palestinian authority. It also established May 1999 as the date by which a permanent status agreement for
the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect.

In 1994, the Palestinian National Authority was established after the signing of the Cairo Agreement.
One year later Prime Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman Arafat signed the Israeli-Palestinian Interim
Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in Washington. The agreement, witnessed by the US
President and by Russia, Egypt, Norway, and the European Union, broadened Palestinian self-
government by means of a popularly elected legislative council. It provided for the election and
establishment of that body, the transfer of civil authority, Israeli redeployment from major population
centers in the West Bank, security arrangements, and cooperation in a variety of areas.

In October 1998, Israel and the Palestinians signed the Wye River agreement. The Wye agreement is based
on the principle of reciprocity and meets the essential requirements of both the parties, including
unprecedented security measures on the part of the Palestinians and the further redeployment of Israeli
troops in the West Bank. This agreement set May 99 as the date by which a permanent status agreement
should have been reached. Due to the recent Israeli elections, the peace process was put on hold.

III. Economic Outlook

The Palestinian Economy is increasingly unable to sustain jobs and income for its people. In
contrast to the initial economic scenarios that were projected early in the peace process and despite the
assistance of the international donor community, the standard of living has continued to fall due to
massive unemployment and rising poverty. These have been directly provoked by recurrent and
unpredictable border closures imposed by the Israeli government (in 1996, the borders remained closed
for 130 days).

Poverty Rate (1995) 19.1%
Unemployment Rate (1996) 28.4%
Decline in Palestinian employment in Israel 76%
Decline in per capita real consumption (1992-96) 15%

• The private sector has sustained the greatest losses from the labor and trade interruptions resulting
from permit and closure policies. At the same time, the public sector has grown dramatically, with
growth dominated by personnel rather than investments in infrastructure projects, which account for
less than 2% of GDP (in 1997, Palestine GDP was estimated to be $3.5 bn).

• In addition to the negative shocks of permit and closure policies, the Palestinian economy faces
important physical infrastructure weaknesses (i.e: transportation, electricity, and
telecommunications).

• Palestine is heavily dependent on Israel for infrastructure, services and trade. Additionally, a large
share of revenues comes from Israel in the form of tax clearances (over 60% of 1996 fiscal revenue).

• The development of the financial system has been limited by economic and political uncertainties.
However, the banking system has expanded substantially in the last three years. Deposits increased
from $220 million in 1993 to $1.7 billion in 1996.

• The Palestinian economy is operating far below its potential. It has some important assets that are
only partially used and that, under the right circumstances, could foster the region's economy. It has:
(i) a high-quality human resource base; (ii) private capital resources ready to be invested if the business
environment and policy framework are conducive; (iii) international networks; (iv) no debt burden and
a "good" tax system.

• The Palestinian finance minister, Mohammed Nashashibi, presented a draft budget for 1999 in early
April. It highlights the above mentioned weaknesses of Palestine's economy, including excessive
public sector spending on wages and salaries, dependence on foreign aid, and high budget deficit.

• Power Industry

- The West Bank and Gaza Strip has access to about 300MW of power, almost exclusively through the
Israel Electric Company. (The 136 MW plant, when completed, will initially supply only the Gaza
Strip.)
- The Palestinian Authority is eager to reduce dependence on this external source. Further supporting
the need for in-country power production is the apparent suppressed demand in the region.
- The European Investment Bank has agreed to lend the Palestinian Authority $39M toward upgrading
and refurbishing the electricity sector in the West Bank. Additionally, international donors have
pledged a total of $80M toward rehabilitating this sector by 2001, with the World Bank to provide
$15M and the Italian government to furnish $26M. [Sweden has committed $40M to infrastructure
development.]

Macroeconomic Indicators

PADICO was founded by the Arab Bank and the Cairo Amman Bank in 1993. It reported $10
million in working capital in 1997 and has already invested $500 million in the Palestinian economy,
whose entire GDP is a mere $3.5 billion. It has planned another $500 million investments in the next
two years.

PADICO, whose operations include tourism, real state, poultry farming, plastics, pharmaceuticals,
electronics and communications companies, is underwriting several large real-state schemes
including new housing projects in Gaza. PADICO was also responsible for developing the Palestine
Securities Exchange in Nablus. The exchange trades on Sundays and Tuesdays and lists 23
companies.

IV. PADICO, APIC

The organizations that have provided the most money for projects in the Palestinian-controlled areas, in
addition to the donor countries, are: (i) the Palestine Development and Investment Company (PADICO),
and (ii) the Arab Palestinian Investment Company. Both organizations are partners in the project.

ii. APIC's bankers include both Palestinian expatriates and Arab Investors. APIC's strategy is to enter
into partnerships with existing companies, supply them with capital and bring in experienced
technicians, managers and marketing experts to turn the companies around.

CONCLUSION

Despite the Oslo and Paris Accords and the efforts to reach a definitive peace agreement, political risk
and social turmoil have severely hindered the Palestinian economy.

Several private initiatives from the likes of PADICO and APIC, along with the aid of donor countries,
the UN and the European Union, have been trying to boost the Palestinian private sector.

With strong assets but equally burdensome liabilities, the Palestinian economy is on a knife's edge
between take-off and collapse. Much will depend on the evolution of the peace process. Even with the
$3.3 billion in donor support assumed for the next five years, the Palestinian economy will perform
well only under exceptional conditions involving an open economy and the complete removal of
Israeli constraints in effect since March 1993. This is highly uncertain and unpredictable.
