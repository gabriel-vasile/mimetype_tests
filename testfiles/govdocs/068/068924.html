TOUR OPTION # 1:<br> Santuario de Chimayo with lunch at Rancho de 
Chimayo</p>
<p>
The guests will board their luxury motor coach with their expert guides as 
they drive through some of the most beautiful scenery Northern New Mexico 
has to offer.  Winding up through the high desert plateau, the guests will 
get a glimpse into the ancient, villages along the way that were settled by 
the Spaniards in the mid 1700's.
<p>
Upon arrival to the town of Chimayo, we will make our first stop at the 
historic adobe restaurant, Rancho de Chimayo. Known internationally for its 
unique Mexican cuisine and beautiful atmosphere, the guests will enjoy 
traditionally prepared dishes using locally grown products and recipes that 
have been in the Jaramillo family for centuries. 
<p>
Afterwards, you will enjoy a guided walk through the historic town Plaza and 
the miraculous santuario.   In 1810, a Chimayo friar was performing penances 
when he saw a light bursting from a hillside. Digging, he found a crucifix, 
and so a small chapel was built on the site. Then the miraculous healings 
began. 
<p>
Believed to be built on sacred earth with miraculous healing powers, the 
legendary shrine El Santuario de Chimayo, is one of the most visited in the 
United States. The crucifix which began the original shrine still resides on 
the chapel alter, but its curative powers have been overshadowed by the 
"sacred sand pit" from which it sprang.  Each year during Holy Week 
thousands of people make a pilgrimage to Chimayo to visit the Santuario and 
take away a bit of the sacred dirt.
<p>
Also included in the tour will be visits to the famous weaver's studios of 
Chimayo for a glimpse at this centuries old art form.  This is an 
exceptional tour that really gives an insider's view into the culture, 
history and legends of New Mexico.

TOUR OPTION # 2: <br>Bandelier National Monument with Picnic Lunch</p>
<p>
Over 10,000 years ago, Pueblo Indians began to migrate south into the canyon 
and mesa country of the Southwest. They came first following the herds of 
migratory animals which they hunted for food. Later, after receiving corn 
in trade from Mesoamerica, they began to search for places to live which 
would provide them with all of the resources they needed to farm this 
difficult land. 
<p>
An abundant water source, trees for use in building and for firewood, and 
rich volcanic soil were among the reasons these prehistoric Pueblo Indians 
settled in the area which is now part of Bandelier National Monument. Best 
known for mesas, sheer-walled canyons, and the ancestral Pueblo dwellings 
found among them, Bandelier was named for Adolph Bandelier, a 19th-century 
anthropologist who was brought to the canyon by Native Americans from 
Cochiti Pueblo in October 1880.
<p>
The guests will board their deluxe motor coach which will include coolers of 
iced waters and as they depart on their adventure, they will be given a very 
informative, witty talk by their expert, native guides to prepare them for 
what they will be seeing at the monument.
<p>
Upon arrival, the guests will be taken to a private area, alongside a stream 
where they will enjoy a leisurely, boxed, picnic lunch beneath the 
cottonwood trees.   Afterwards, the guests will be led on a private, guided 
hike through Frijoles Canyon.   Ruins of the ancient village still stand on 
the floor of this beautiful canyon. On the cliff walls above are the remains 
of the dwellings which were also home to these extraordinary people. 
Visitors can glimpse into the cliff dwellings by climbing ladders and 
actually entering these pre-historic homes, for an unforgettable experience.
<p>
The sheer beauty of the canyon and possibility of seeing native wildlife, 
combined with a streamside, picnic lunch make this trip truly a spectacular 
experience that may prove to be the highlight of the group's visit to New 
Mexico! 
<p>

TOUR OPTION # 3:<br> Walking Tour of Los Alamos, Museums and lunch at 
    Gabriel's</p>
<p>
Los Alamos is located on the Pajarito Plateau at the foot of the majestic 
Jemez Mountains. This small Northern New Mexico town offers both 
spectacular scenery and intriguing history. From its beginnings as the site 
of the secret scientific Manhattan Project, it continues as the home of Los 
Alamos National Laboratory.
<p>
As guests board their deluxe motor coach, they will be enthralled with the 
informative talk given by their native guides regarding the secretive and 
interesting history surrounding the Los Alamos National Laboratories.  Our 
first stop will be for a delicious lunch at the renowned restaurant 
Gabriel's, located 20 minutes outside of Santa Fe on our way to Los Alamos.  
Perhaps the best homemade guacamole and margaritas this side of the border, 
the guests will enjoy a traditional, authentic Mexican lunch. 
<p>
Upon arrival to Los Alamos, the tour will begin with a short walking tour 
followed by a guided tour of the Bradbury Museum.  Professionally designed 
exhibits include: videotapes, videodisks, interactive computer programs as 
well as a Mark 12A warhead, models of Vela and Navistar verification and 
communication satellites, and an air-launched cruise missile.
<p>
Also available to the public are many unclassified exhibits, World War II 
era documents and photographs tracing the development of the town and the 
Laboratory.  We will also be including a visit to the Los Alamos historical 
Museum to include the Fuller Lodge, and the Ice house Museum that was 
originally used to store classified exhibits. 
<p>
This is truly a fascinating look at American history and science that will 
be an exciting experience for any visitor to New Mexico.

TOUR OPTION # 4: <br>Guided Hike of Tent Rocks Monument and Picnic Lunch</p>
<p>
This tour will give the guests an excellent opportunity to get out into some 
of our spectacular scenery and hike through amazing rock formations, 
scientifically known as hoo-doos.  Comprised of volcanic tuff, these 
formations appear as if they were from the moon's surface and offer the 
casual hiker a wonderful way to spend a day outside the city of Santa Fe. 
<p>
Tent Rock Canyon is a narrow slice through some tuff ejected from small 
volcanoes at the edge of the massive Jemez Volcano. In places the walls of 
the canyon are 200 feet high.  The canyon takes its name from the 
surrounding weird towers of tuff capped by harder, more erosion-resistant 
rocks.   Two trails wind into this wonderland filled with conical spires 
roughly shaped like tepees. 
<p>
After a brief hike into the canyon, the guests will drop into a broad 
amphitheater surrounded by banded cliffs. The trail follows the base of the 
cliffs, passing a cave that shows signs of use by ancient Anasazi/Pueblo 
people. 
<p>
Our expert guides will accompany the group for the duration of the hike 
pointing out various petroglyphs, and geological points of interest.  After 
hiking a bit down the trail, the group will stop for a gourmet, boxed picnic 
lunch.
<p>
This tour is a wonderful way to get outdoors and enjoy the crisp blue skies 
and sunshine while appreciating this incredible geological site located on 
an existing Native American pueblo.
