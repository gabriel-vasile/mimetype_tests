        Do not play in it</p>
      <p align=center>Sign on the wall of El Santuario de Chimayo, New Mexico</p>
      <p>This place feels old beyond human recollection. The carvings and paintings 
        were surely done by human hands, but no one remembers whose hands those 
        were. The work is striking, especially in the apse behind the altar. There, 
        the colors of surrounding hills have been transferred onto nearly luminous 
        wooden reredos full of Catholic symbolism. Above the altar hangs a most 
        intricate ancient Christ crucified on a green cross. Overhead, the roof 
        is held in place by massive carved wooden beams, big around as human bodies 
        and blackened by nearly two centuries of incense and candle smoke. The 
        air is rich with the memory of thousands of benedictions and baptisms. 
        Threadbare trousers have polished the pews to a high varnish that this 
        afternoon ripples with a low orange glow from dozens of votive candles 
        burning purposefully in back of the church.</p>
      <p>This is El Santuario de Chimayo, an old adobe-brick and stucco structure 
        in the hills of northern New Mexico. This chapel was built in 1816, but 
        a sanctuary has been at this site for much longer. The locals offer many 
        legends about its origins, fanciful tales of miraculous crucifixes and 
        Santo Niños. But the truth is buried beneath the murk of time. One thing 
        is clear though, as beautiful as the sanctuary is and as striking as the 
        crucifix (El Sefior de Esquipalas) above the altar is, nearly none of 
        those in the pews today have come to see the sanctuary or the crucifix. 
        Instead, they have come from all over the world to this place in New Mexico 
        to eat the dirt that lies beneath the adobe floor.</p>
      <p>According to legend, that dirt is sacred, consecrated by Christ himself. 
        Crutches cast off by the newly healed fill the anteroom, and on some days, 
        the line of pilgrims stretches for blocks. Some call this place the Lourdes 
        of America, but in Chimayo the miracle can be seen each day by anyone 
        who peers into a low-ceilinged room off the main entrance. There, a hole 
        (the <i>posito</i>), half a meter across, pierces the floor. Beside it, 
        someone has left a plastic spoon to aid the faithful. Beyond the spoon, 
        beneath the opening, lies only dirt, only the deep-red dirt of Chimayo.</p>
      <p>Most of the faithful here today have come to eat that dirt. This religious 
        tradition is practiced, as far as I know, only at one other place—a Catholic 
        shrine in Esquipalas, Guatemala. But pilgrims to these shrines are not 
        the only humans who eat dirt. Nor are religious reasons the only reasons 
        to imagine that dirt may have special powers.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="geo"></a>Geophagy 
        (Eating Dirt) and Its Reasons</font></h3>
      <p>Other than water, what little stuff we humans have inside us is largely 
        dirt. Admittedly, this dirt is sometimes highly processed before we receive 
        it, but most solids that make up humans and other creatures either are 
        now or recently were dirt (the simple stuff that stripes the outer surface 
        of our world, the thin paste that raises us above rocks) transformed by 
        sunlight into plants or animals. Most of us prefer the dirt we eat in 
        the form of cows and sheep and carrots and squash and bison and sorghum. 
        Other dirt we’d just as soon scrape from our feet and leave at the door.</p>
      <p>But not everyone wishes to be so far removed from the stuff of mud pies 
        and mucilage. On every continent (except, possibly, Antarctica), some 
        of us intentionally eat dirt, and we are joined in this practice by a 
        myriad of rats, mice, mule deer, birds, elephants, African buffalo, cattle, 
        tapirs, pacas, and several species of primates (<a href="#1">1</a>). Most 
        scientists consider animal geophagy “normal,” probably because most soil 
        consumption by animals has no obvious adverse effects and is sometimes 
        beneficial (<a href="#1">2</a>); however, some of these same scientists 
        consider most (or all) human geophagy “abnormal.”</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abnormal Behavior</font></h4>
      <p>In the United States, many of us believe that humans should only eat 
        food. We consider the consumption of nonfood items pathological, even 
        though we know that what people define as “food” varies dramatically by 
        region and ethnicity. We call the pathological act of eating nonfood items 
        pica. Pica is a disease, but a disease different from polio or smallpox. 
        No infectious agent is obviously associated with pica. Pica is a disease 
        only because we believe normal “undiseased” persons would not eat anything 
        but traditional human foods; some of those who do, some of the time, are 
        at considerable risk because of their unusual appetites.</p>
      <p>Pathological consumption of soil, “soil pica,” is associated with several 
        psychological abnormalities. But all ingestion of soil is not soil pica. 
        How much soil a person has to eat to be considered ill is not known. One 
        report described soil pica in a developmentally disabled person who regularly 
        consumed more than 50 g of soil per day (<a href="#1">3</a>). Most of 
        us would consider that level of geophagy at least potentially pathological, 
        although I am not sure why.</p>
      <p>In June 2000, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
        appointed a committee to review soil pica. The committee settled on pathological 
        levels as consumption of more than 500 mg of soil per day but conceded 
        that the amount selected was arbitrary (<a href="#1">3</a>). Soil consumption 
        is defined as pathological according to the amount eaten (no normal person 
        could possibly eat that much dirt) and the severity of health consequences 
        (lead poisoning, parasites). Because underlying psychological or biologic 
        abnormalities are not easy to establish, I explore only what appears to 
        be nonpathological dirt eating in pregnant women (especially in sub-Saharan 
        Africa), migrants from sub-Saharan cultures to other parts of the world 
        (notably the United States), and children worldwide.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inadvertent Exposure</font></h4>
      <p>Why is it, that in spite of all the times we’ve been told not to, we 
        still eat dirt? This is a very complex question with many possible answers. 
        And while each proposed answer has its advocates, no single answer seems 
        satisfactory to all—except one. Almost everyone agrees on one cause of 
        geophagy, inadvertent consumption of air-, water-, and foodborne dirt. 
        Contaminated food, soiled hands, and inhaled dust add soil to our diets. 
        Children ingest considerable amounts of soil in these ways. My children 
        did. Of course, my children also ate dirt on purpose. But child or adult, 
        each of us inadvertently eats a little dirt every day. This dirt can pose 
        a health threat, especially near sites of industrial contamination, but 
        dirt we eat intentionally poses a greater challenge. Intention may indicate 
        something biologic that drives some of us (sometimes regularly, sometimes 
        religiously, sometimes ritually) to eat dirt.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tradition and Culture</font></h4>
      <p>For centuries, indigenous peoples have routinely used clays (decomposed 
        rock, silica and aluminum or magnesium salts, absorbed organic materials) 
        in food preparation. The clays were used to remove toxins (e.g., in aboriginal 
        acorn breads); as condiments or spices (in the Philippines, New Guinea, 
        Costa Rica, Guatemala, the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America); 
        and as food during famine (<a href="#1">4</a>). Clays were also often 
        used in medications (e.g., kaolin clay in Kaopectate). But the most common 
        occasion for eating dirt in many societies (the only occasion in some 
        societies) is pregnancy. When sperm and egg collide, the world changes. 
        That is obvious. But why pregnant women eat dirt is not.</p>
      <p>Wiley and Katz (<a href="#1">5</a>) have proposed that eating clay serves 
        different purposes during different periods of pregnancy, soothing stomach 
        upset during morning sickness in the first trimester and supplementing 
        nutrients (especially calcium) during the second and third trimesters, 
        when the fetal skeleton is forming. This type of geophagy occurs most 
        commonly in cultures of sub-Saharan Africa and their descendants (<a href="#1">5</a>). 
        The timing of dirt ingestion and amounts consumed vary with tribes and 
        individual persons, but soil comes consistently from certain sites. In 
        some cultures, well-established trade routes and clay traders make rural 
        clays available for geophagy even in urban settings. Clays from termite 
        mounds are especially popular among traded clays, perhaps because they 
        are rich in calcium (<a href="#1">5</a>). Whatever the underlying reason, 
        geophagy in Africa does not appear to be a recent cultural development; 
        it may predate <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
      <p>Women eat dirt during the first, second, or third trimester or throughout 
        pregnancy (<a href="#1">5</a>), often throughout the day, as a supplement 
        rather than a meal. Most commonly consumed are subsurface clays, especially 
        kaolin and montmorillonite (<a href="#1">5</a>), 30 g to 50 g a day (sometimes 
        much more) (<a href="#1">3</a>). However, eating dirt is not always confined 
        to pregnant women, even among the cultures of sub-Saharan Africa (<a href="#1">4</a>), 
        nor is it limited to tribes with little or no access to dairy-derived 
        calcium (<a href="#1">5</a>), so these hypotheses do not adequately explain 
        local tastes for dirt.</p>
      <p>Soil, including kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays, contains considerable 
        amounts of organic material, including many live microorganisms. The human 
        gut is the largest area of direct contact between a person and the world. 
        Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a major site of T-cell differentiation 
        and selection in adults and of intense immunologic activity (including 
        T lymphopoiesis) in children and adults (<a href="#1">6–9</a>). And while 
        it is not entirely clear why some gut-introduced antigens promote tolerance 
        of microorganisms and others immunize against them (<a href="#1">10</a>), 
        it is clear that immunization via the gut is a major source of immunoglobulin 
        (Ig) A, both locally and systemically (<a href="#1">6–10</a>).</p>
      <p>Regular consumption of soil might boost the mother’s secretory immune 
        system. Monkeys that regularly eat dirt have lower parasite loads (<a href="#1">1</a>). 
        In some cultures, clays are baked before they are eaten, which could boost 
        immunity from previous exposures. For decades we have used aluminum salts, 
        like those found in clays, as adjuvants in human and animal vaccines. 
        Adjuvants are compounds that nonspecifically amplify immune response, 
        probably because of their effects on innate defenses such as macrophages, 
        dendritic cells, and the inflammatory response. Aluminum compounds make 
        effective adjuvants because they are relatively nontoxic, the charged 
        surfaces of aluminum salts absorb large numbers of organic molecules, 
        and macrophages and dendritic cells readily phagocytose the particulates 
        produced by the combination of the adjuvants and the organic compounds 
        (<a href="#11">11</a>). The clays that pregnant women and others consume, 
        which are rich in aluminum compounds, likely make at least passable immunologic 
        adjuvants. For all these reasons, clays might act as vaccines. And the 
        IgA antibodies produced against the associated organic antigens may appear 
        in breast milk and have a major role in mucosal protection of newborns.</p>
      <p>In pregnant women, this type of gut immunization might produce high levels 
        of IgA against endemic pathogens and other antigens. All this IgA would 
        appear shortly before birth in the breast milk and would provide protection 
        for infants against precisely the pathogens encountered immediately after 
        birth. Furthermore, IgA antibodies prevent attachment of bacteria and 
        some viruses at mucosal surfaces (<a href="#11">12</a>), the major contact 
        between the infant and the infectious world. In humans, mucosal surfaces 
        offer the only routes of natural immunization short of wounding, and dirt 
        would seem to offer a potent vaccine containing many endemic pathogens—no 
        needles, no sugar-cube, no gene gun.</p>
      <p>Eating dirt, then, rather than being abnormal, may be an evolutionary 
        adaptation acquired over millennia of productive and not-so-productive 
        interactions with bacteria—an adaptation that enhances fetal immunity 
        and increases calcium, eliminates gastric upset, detoxifies some plant 
        and animal toxins, and perhaps boosts mothers’ immunity at times when 
        the hormones of pregnancy (<a href="#11">13</a>), factors produced by 
        the fetus (<a href="#11">14</a>), changes in the complement system, replacement 
        of MHC class I antigens in the trophoblast (<a href="#11">15</a>), and 
        who knows what else suppress the mother’s natural immunologic desire to 
        destroy her fetus—a miracle, nearly.</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Innate Tendency</font></h4>
      <p>My children ate dirt with surprising gusto, garden soil, road soil, leaf-mush 
        soil, sod soil, bug-body soil—even gutter soil. As usual with my children, 
        before I could talk them out of this behavior, they gave it up on their 
        own—their behavior depending more on personal likes and dislikes than 
        on my paternal concerns. I was pleased when they quit. Later I was reassured 
        to discover from other parents that their children were just as taken 
        with dirt as mine, some even more so. I felt less like the parent of a 
        couple of dirt-eating, psychosis-ridden, nutritionally deprived children, 
        even if my children were never quite “normal.”</p>
      <p>Eating dirt appears nearly universal among children under 2 years of 
        age. When I asked my 2-year-old daughter why she ate dirt, she just stared 
        at me, her eyes wide open, a thick moustache of loam limning her lips. 
        She must have decided that either what I had asked was unfathomably abstract 
        or her answer would be far beyond my comprehension.</p>
      <p>Soil pica has been defined as eating 500 mg to &gt;50 g of soil per day 
        (<a href="#1">3</a>). But the general applicability of these numbers is 
        widely disputed (pregnant women in Africa eat far more soil than this). 
        By inference, however, normal soil consumption must fall into the range 
        of 0 mg to 500 mg per day per small mouth. Soils consumed by children 
        may differ from those consumed by adults. Generally, children consume 
        topsoils and not the deep (60 cm- to 90-cm deep) clays adults regularly 
        consume (<a href="#1">5</a>). And children are considerably less selective 
        in the sites they choose for dirt to eat. But why children eat dirt remains 
        largely obscure to all but children.</p>
      <p>Children may eat soil for the same reasons pregnant women and some animals 
        do (<a href="#1">2,4</a>,<a href="#11">16–18</a>). Because of their rapid 
        growth, they have special nutritional needs and surface soils may serve 
        as supplemental nutrients; detoxification of plant or animal toxins might 
        be accelerated by geophagy— particularly in some parts of the world; or 
        soil components, especially clays, may relieve gastric distress. But topsoils 
        are probably not as effective as deep clays at gastric soothing.</p>
      <p>Among children, too, it seems eating dirt might have immunologic consequences. 
        Maternal immunoglobulins are secreted in breast milk shortly before birth 
        and for 1 year or more afterwards. Children often begin eating dirt a 
        year or two after birth. As maternal immunity wanes, eating dirt might 
        “vaccinate” children who are losing their maternal IgA, which could stimulate 
        production of nascent immunoglobulins, especially IgA. Eating dirt might 
        also help populate intestinal flora.</p>
      <p>But all of this remains speculative. No clear evidence supports a biologic 
        benefit to geophagy among children. Its frequency and distribution, though, 
        suggest a greater biologic involvement than the simple oral obsessions 
        of children.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="ris"></a>Risks of 
        Eating Dirt</font></h3>
      <p>How dangerous is eating dirt? My mother was pretty certain about this—damn 
        dangerous. Soils contaminated by industrial or human pollutants pose considerable 
        threat to anyone who eats them. Reports abound of lead poisoning and other 
        toxicities in children eating contaminated soils. Similarly, we do not 
        have to look farther than the last refugee camp or the slums of Calcutta 
        or Tijuana or Basra to find the dangers of soils contaminated with untreated 
        human waste. But the inherent biologic danger of soil is difficult to 
        assess. Soil unaffected by the pressures of overpopulation, industry, 
        and agriculture may be vastly different from the soil most of us encounter 
        routinely.</p>
      <p>Using DNA-hybridization analyses, Torsvik et al. (<a href="#11">19,20</a>) 
        found an estimated 4,600 species of prokaryotic microorganisms per gram 
        of natural soil. Subsequent investigations, using more sophisticated techniques, 
        found even more species (<a href="#11">20</a>), 700–7,000 g of biomass 
        per cubic meter of soil. Soil is a considerable biologic sink, and certainly 
        some organisms found in it are pathogenic in humans. Yet evidence of soil 
        as a major cause of disease in humans and other animals is limited. And 
        many reported diseases are the result of an abnormal situation, e.g., 
        industrial pollution or untreated sewage.</p>
      <p>Most infectious diseases acquired through eating dirt are associated 
        with childhood geophagy, which routinely involves topsoils rather than 
        deep clays. One recent report describes infection of two children at separate 
        sites with raccoon roundworm (<i>Baylisascaris procyonis</i> ) (<a href="#21">21</a>). 
        The infection resulted in severe neurologic damage to both children, and 
        one died. The roundworm was ingested along with soil in both cases. Eating 
        dirt can have dire consequences.</p>
      <p>In the United States, the most common parasitic infection associated 
        with geophagy is toxocariasis, most often caused by the worm <i>Toxocara 
        canis</i>. Seroprevalence is 4% to 8% depending on the region, but incidence 
        of antibodies to <i>T. canis</i> is as high as 16%–30% among blacks and 
        Hispanics. The most common route of infection is ingestion of soil contaminated 
        with dog or cat feces (<a href="#21">22</a>). Even though, humans are 
        only paratenic hosts of <i>T. canis</i>, under some circumstances (though 
        severe cases are rare), the worm can cause considerable damage (visceral 
        larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, urticaria, pulmonary nodules, hepatic 
        and lymphatic visceral larva migrans, arthralgias) (<a href="#21">22–24</a>). 
        Toxocara eggs persist in soil for years. As with soils contaminated by 
        human wastes, soil consumption itself does not cause toxocariasis. And 
        studies of seroprevalence do not distinguish between infection and immunization.</p>
      <p>Among children in Nigeria, the most common parasitic infection associated 
        with eating dirt is ascariasis (<a href="#21">25</a>). Ascarid worms infect 
        as many as 25% of the world’s population (more than 1.25 billion). <i>A 
        scaris lumbricoides</i> is the most common worm. Asymptomatic in many 
        adults, infection is much more serious in children; intestinal obstruction 
        is the most common symptom. Because the worms do not replicate in humans, 
        reexposure is required to maintain infection beyond 2 years. The correlation 
        between geophagy and helminth infection varies with different helminthes. 
        Geissler et al. reported correlation between geophagy and ascariasis (especially 
        caused by <i>A. lumbricoides</i>) and possibly trichuriasis but none between 
        geophagy and reinfection with <i>Schistosoma mansoni, Trichuris trichiura</i>, 
        or hookworm (<a href="#21">26</a>). All parasites that infest soil do 
        not uniformly infect people who consume dirt. Nor do all who eat dirt 
        routinely contract disease.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="imm"></a>Immunologic 
        Development and Infectious Disease</font></h3>
      <p>Many nonhuman animals regularly eat dirt, generally without ill effects 
        and in many cases with some benefits. Even in humans, there are few reports 
        of infections routinely associated with geophagy by pregnant women in 
        sub-Saharan Africa, probably because women take clays from 60 cm to 90 
        cm below the soil surface and, at least some of the time, they bake the 
        clays. But these factors seem inadequate to fully account for the frequent 
        absence of overt ill effects.</p>
      <p>Helminth infections associated with geophagy appear to affect the frequency 
        of inflammatory bowel diseases, which occur most often in industrialized 
        nations. The underlying cause of these diseases may be abnormal immune 
        response to the contents of the gut or perhaps to the gut itself (<a href="#21">27</a>). 
        Inflammatory bowel diseases occur at much lower rates in regions where 
        helminth infections are common. Development of normal gut-associated immune 
        response may be aided by the presence of worms.</p>
      <p>In studies of healthy mice, <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> prevented colitis 
        induced with tri-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid by redirecting a primarily 
        Th-1 response to a Th-2 response (<a href="#21">28</a>). Preliminary studies 
        indicate that helminth infection may also alter the course of inflammatory 
        bowel disease in humans (<a href="#21">29</a>). Soil is a rich source 
        of parasitic worms. Studies using a number of other animals have also, 
        at least indirectly, associated dirt and microorganisms with normal immunity.</p>
      <p>The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that children in the United 
        States consume, on average, 200–800 mg of dirt per day. Some children 
        regularly consume more than their allotment. Still, that doesn’t seem 
        like a lot of dirt. We parents have tried for years to put a stop to it. 
        I don’t know of an instance in which anybody has succeeded in keeping 
        children away from dirt. But animals have been successfully raised in 
        absolutely sterile environments. Rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, and rats 
        have been raised under such conditions (<a href="#21">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>). 
        In each case, the immune system failed to develop normally. Lymph nodes 
        and GALT did not achieve the right shape or composition and could not 
        initiate normal immune response. Reexposure to infection later in life 
        does not work, at least not fully. There is a window when infection drives 
        the immune system toward its proper end. After that, mice, rats, rabbits, 
        and guinea pigs are at the mercy of the microbial world.</p>
      <p>Evidence suggests that the results would be the same in children. In 
        large families, children with many older brothers and sisters are less 
        likely to have asthma, hay fever, or eczema. West African children who 
        have had measles are half as likely to have allergies as children who 
        never had measles. Italian students who recovered from infection with 
        hepatitis A had fewer and less severe allergies than fellow students who 
        were never infected. Children with Type I diabetes (an autoimmune disease) 
        are less likely to have had infections before their fifth birthdays than 
        healthy children of the same age. Children raised in rural areas, especially 
        on farms, have fewer allergies and autoimmune diseases than children raised 
        in cities. All of these notions have been referred to as the “hygiene 
        hypothesis” (<a href="#31">32</a>).</p>
      <p>Children exposed a little more to the infectious face of this world seem 
        to fare better as adults. I do not mean to say that vaccination is inappropriate. 
        Vaccination is, most often, infection, and vaccinations have done more 
        to improve childhood survival rates that any other single bit of modern 
        medicine. Nor are water purification and sewage treatment inappropriate. 
        Water and sewage treatment have done even more than vaccination to eliminate 
        disease in areas where human populations have exceeded the ability of 
        the local environment to deal with human waste and the pathogens associated 
        with it. But, evidence indicates that infection early in life is critical 
        for the development of normal immune systems.</p>
      <p>Exposure-dependent development is not limited to the immune system. Animals, 
        humans included, must be exposed to the sights, sounds, feels tastes, 
        and smells of this septic world. When we are not, our nervous systems 
        do not develop normally, do not rewire, expand, and contract as they must 
        to survive (<a href="#31">33</a>). For humans, as for rabbits, there is 
        a window in childhood when our experiences, our infections, change everything, 
        once and for all. Inside that window, infection causes lymph nodes and 
        GALT to enlarge and reorganize, to separate into cortices and medullae, 
        into primary lymphoid follicles, and develop T- and B-lymphocyte–rich 
        regions of immune competence destined to someday be germinal centers, 
        where our defenses will muster and the real battle will be fought. This 
        window is a defining moment, when the simplest and lowest forms of life—the 
        dirty, the infectious, the parasitic, and the septic—alter who we are.</p>
      <p>We do not know which childhood infections are most important, but several 
        studies implicate mycobacterial infections. A large group of bacteria 
        most of which cause no apparent disease, the mycobacteria, have strains 
        that cause serious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, leprosy). Mice injected 
        with ovalbumin (the major protein in egg white) become allergic to ovalbumin. 
        But mice first infected with mycobacteria and then injected with ovalbumin 
        do not become allergic (<a href="#31">34</a>).</p>
      <p>Early infection of children with some mycobacteria may promote strong 
        immune systems, a normal sense of self, and a normal defense of that self. 
        Mycobacteria are found in large numbers in dirt. And animals (probably 
        including humans) kept from this dirt may lose the ability to recognize 
        certain dangerous organisms as a threat, lose the ability to discriminate 
        between self and not self, and lose the ability to distinguish the fatal 
        from the innocuous.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="age"></a>The “Age 
        of Bacteria”</font></h3>
      <p>For more than 3 billion years, microorganisms, especially bacteria, have 
        ruled earth. As Stephen Jay Gould said, “We live now in the ‘Age of Bacteria.’ 
        Our planet has always been in the ‘Age of Bacteria’ ever since the first 
        fossils, bacteria of course, were entombed in rocks more than three and 
        a half billion years ago” (<a href="#31">35</a>). And bacteria have done 
        more than any other living group to alter the character of this earth 
        (<a href="#31">36</a>). It has been estimated that more than 10<sup>29</sup> 
        bacteria live on this planet and as many as 10<sup>14</sup> live on each 
        one of us. Through all of history, we humans have waltzed with bacteria 
        and the rest of the microscopic world. We had no choice. Bacteria outnumber, 
        outweigh, out-travel, and outevolve us.</p>
      <p>That bacteria cause so many human diseases is not astounding. It is astounding 
        that so few bacteria cause human disease. Pathogenic bacteria are merely 
        the microscopic tip of the largest of all biologic icebergs. How fortunate, 
        we imagine. But fortune may have little or nothing to do with our survival. 
        Billions of years of confrontation rather than luck were likely our benefactor. 
        Through those confrontations and those eons, nearly all of us learned 
        to coexist peacefully. Neither humans nor microorganisms benefit from 
        fully destroying the other. Fatal infections seem, biologically at least, 
        shortsighted. And even a brief course of antibiotics is enough to remind 
        us that a world without bacteria would be a poorer world. This is not 
        a war, as it has often been described, even though we have mustered an 
        impressive array of weapons—bactericidal cribs and mattresses, toilet 
        cleaners and counter tops, blankets, deodorants, shampoos, hand soaps, 
        mouthwashes, toothpastes. This is not a war at all. If it were, we would 
        have lost long ago, overpowered by sheer numbers and evolutionary speed. 
        This is something else, something like a lichen, something like a waltz. 
        This waltz will last for all of human history. We must hold our partners 
        carefully and dance well.</p>
