	AURORAL ANNOTATIONS

Data are arranged as year, month, day, place and source. Notes, 
if any, are on the following line.

B.C.E. approximately 2600-2200
Wang and Siscoe (1995)
From Chinese records.

B.C.E. ca. 340		Byzantium
Brodribb and Besant (1879)
During the siege of the city by Philip of Macedon it is said that 
a sudden radiance in the form of a crescent streamed across the 
sky. Stothers rejects this as an aurora.

B.C.E. 208		China
Biot (1844)

B.C.E. 113		Italy?
Clerke (1886)

65, 66 			Jerusalem
Botley (1964)

c. 85			Britain
Britton (1937) p. 11
"Boece gives a list of prodigies supposed to have been seen just 
before the departure from Britain of Julius Agricola. Amongst 
these is an account of a 'battle in the air,' a term frequently 
used by old writers for vivid auroral displays. Tacitus, however, 
is silent as to these phenomena in his De Vita Agricolae.

112				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 11
"Battles in the air (i.e., auroral appearances. No mention before 
Short."  Thus, very doubtful.

119				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 12
"Auroral appearances. No reference before Short. In another place 
he says they were followed by famine." Thus, very doubtful.

c. 230			London, England
Britton (1937) p. 13
"In hist time, Armies of Footmen and Horsemen were seen in the 
Air over London and divers others places, Fighting: together with 
great Blasts, Thunders and Lightnings, followed by mighty Storms 
of Hail and Tempestes, that did much Dammage." Britton comments: 
"Seller allocates these events to the reign of Alexander Severus, 
without specific year. They appear to be imaginary."

249				Britain

Britton (1937) p. 13
"At his coming to the Throne it Rained Blood in divers parts of 
this Kingdom, and a Terrible Bloody Sword was seen in the Air for 
Three Nights, a little after Sunset." Britton comments: "The 
emperor in question is Decius. These prodigies are probably 
imaginary."

303 January 1		Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)
Location taken as Lo-Yang, capital of the Western Chin, 
approximately 34.43 N, 113.30 E. here and in following 4th 
century dates taken from Schove and Ho (1983).

303 September 25	Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)
Doubtful aurora. " ... the heavens divided at the centre into two 
parts, accompanied three times by sounds resembling thunder."

303 December 27	Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)
Doubtful aurora. " ... a red vapour appeared across the heavens 
accompanied by a crashing sound."

304 				Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)
"At night a light like fire."

305 June 20		Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)

305 November 21	Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)
"... a red vapour appeared in the north stretching across the 
heavens from west to east."

306 June			Lo-Yang, China
Schove and Ho (1983)

445				England
Britton (1937) p. 16
Before the Britons beat the Saxons, and the king of the Scots was 
slain, apparitions were seen in the air in England and burning 
spears at Rome ... " Britton comments: "Probably quite mythical."

450 April 4		Europe
Newton (1972)
Year inferred from weekday.

450				Italy?
Clerke (1886)

450 				Hungary
Hedervari (1981)


454				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 17
"Short allocates auroral appearances to this year. No earlier 
record found."  Thus, very doubtful.

455				Europe
Hellman (1921) p. 56
Cited by author of ephemeral pamphlet on aurora of December 28, 
1561. No other information.

502				Edessa
Botley (1964)

512				Europe
Newton (1972)

c. 523			Britain
Britton (1937)
"In his time strange sights were seen of Dragons, Lions and other 
furious wild Beasts Fighting in the Air. In the West of Kent it 
Rained Wheat, and soon after great Drops of Blood, upon which 
ensued extream Dearth ... " Britton comments: "Vaguely allocated 
to the reigh of Octa (c. 513-533). Legendary."

525				Europe
Newton (1972)
Year uncertain.

540				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 19
"Battles in the Air (i.e., auroral appearances)" [citing Short]. 
Britton comments: "The reference is probably to aurorae seen in 
France. Roger of Wendover has an account of this: In the year of 
grace 541, there appeared a comet in Gaul, so vast that the whole 
sky seemed on fire. In the same year there dropped real blood 
from the clouds ... and a dreadful mortality ensued.

An aurora on such a grand scale visible in France was probably 
seen in this country also. Short quotes the alleged rain of blood 
as in 535. The mortality referred to was very extensive and is 
mentioned by Tighernac and other Irish chroniclers." 

Britton does not comment on the one year discrepancy in dates 
with Roger of Wendover.

552 July 25		Europe
Newton (1972)
Year uncertain.

555				England
Pensey (1817)

Citing appearance of lances in the air described by Matthew of 
Westminster. Link appears to attribute this to a comet in 556. 
See also Lowe (1870): In England a brilliant display. See also 
Johnson (1880); Clerke (1886).

555				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 19
"In the year of grace 555 there was seen the appearance of lances 
in the north-west quarter of the heavens." Britton comments: 
"This account of an aurora is derived from Sigebert and may not 
apply to this country."

556				Europe
Newton (1972)
Year uncertain.

560 November 11	Europe
Newton (1972)

562				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 19
"Short refers to a number of phenomena in this year all of which 
seem to be devoid of historical foundation. He has an appearance 
of parhelia, an appearance which might refer to an aurora, and 'a 
very dark day'." Thus, very doubtful.

563				Europe
Newton (1972)

567				British Isles
Lowe (1870)
Brilliant display.

567				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 20
"The same year were seen in the air fiery spears, portending the 
irruption of the Lombards into Italy." Britton comments: "This 
account is again from Sigebertus Gemblacensis. If the aurora was 
visible as far south as Italy it was probably seen here as well. 
Short includes this aurora as in 568.

"Perhaps this is the original source of the mythical events which 
Howie allocates to 570: The fountains ran blood at York in 
England; the trees also seemed on fire at London ... "

580				Europe
Newton (1972)
Year uncertain.

580				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 20
"In the year of grace 580 fiery meteors were seen traversing the 
heavens." Britton comments: "This account derives from Sigebert. 
Probably an aurora but possibly meteoric showers. Short gives the 
date as 579."

582 Easter night.	Europe

Newton (1972)

583 to 1751
Earwaker, 3 Nature 46 (1870)
Citing 1441 auroras noted by Mairan. Cf. R.G., 3 Nature 105: the 
Mairan data are mostly taken from Frobes, and are not reliable 
for displays prior to 1707.

584				Europe
Newton (1972)
Many this year.

585 Twice			Europe
Newton (1972)

585				France
Clerke (1886)
Citing description by Gregory of Tours.

590				Europe
Newton (1972)
The accompanying Easter date indicates 591.

596				England
Britton (1937) p. 20
" ... at which time divers terrible and amazing Sights appeared 
in the Air, of Armies in Rout, with great noises of Thunder and 
flashes of Lightening, many drops of the colour of Blood falling 
at the same time in divers parts of Surry." Britton comments: 
"Quite legendary."

600				Europe
Newton (1872)

616 October 20		China
Biot (1844)
Biot discusses the orientation of the magnetic meridian in China 
based on ancient records. Biot finds 40 descriptions which can be 
classified as aurora, cites only two here.

654				Europe
Newton (1972)

655				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 22
"Fire fell from heaven and great fear came upon men." Britton 
comments: "This account appears to derive from Sigebert."

659 or 660
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"sky was seen to burn"

660				Great Britain
Johnson (1880)

"In the summer the sky was seen to burn.": Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

663 Summer		Ireland
O'Reilly (1902)
The sky seemed to be on fire. Possible aurora.

664 Summer		Europe
Newton (1972)

670				Scotland
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
Fifth day before Easter Sunday. Cloud in the form of a rainbow 
stretching from east to west in a clear sky. The moon turned into 
blood.

670				Great Britain
Johnson (1880)
"A thin and tremulous cloud in the form of a rainbow appeared at 
the fourth watch of the night of the fifth day before Easter 
Sunday (stretching) from east to west in a clear sky." Scottish 
Chronicle.

674				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 23
"In this year a thin and tremulous cloud, a kind of rainbow, 
appeared at the fourth watch of the night on the fifth day before 
Easter, proceeding from the east, and turned into the colour of 
blood." Britton's comments: "If 674 is the correct year the time 
was about 3 a.m. on March 28. Other chroniclers mention that 'the 
moon was turned into blood' and vary the year slightly. This 
phrase usually indicates in the old writers an eclipse of the 
moon but there was no total eclipse shortly before Easter round 
about this year. More probably an aurora is meant.
Short says aurora appeared in March and October of this year but 
adduces no authority as usual." Clearly the same event as that 
mentioned by Johnson, above, as occurring in 670.

680				Scotland
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
Loch turned into blood. Jeremiah says this may be a reflection of 
the color of aurora. Doubtful aurora.

688 November 11	Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
The moon turned into the color of blood. Blood rain was also 
noted for this year and 685; also for 689 and 714. Milk and 
butter turned to blood noted for 690.

688				Scotland
Mottelay (1922)
Purple aurora, citing the Annals of Clan-mac-noise.

688? 690? 693?		Ireland
Kinahan, 3 Nature 105 (1870)

Shower of blood. Kinahan says that scarlet aurora were often 
considered to be a shower of blood. Occurs in annals in 
connection with great battles or the murder of a great chief. 
Annals differ on the date of battle. Cf. Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 
(1870), on the difficulty of associating "blood" with the aurora.

690				Ireland
Clerke (1886)
"In Ireland, such [heavenly] fires turn to streams of blood." 
Shower of blood at battle of 690 between septs of Leinster and 
Ossory.

692				Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"... moon turned of a bloody colour."

710 or 714		Europe
Newton (1972)

710 Autumn		Great Britain
Johnson (1880)
"A bright night in autumn." Scottish Chronicle. This appears to 
be very questionable as an aurora.

715				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 24
"In his Second Year on Midsummer day at Sunseting, dark Clouds 
overspread the Skies, and then withdrawing, the Element seemed to 
be on Fire; after that, many fearful sights appeared in the Air, 
of Armies and Monsterous Creatures; upon which followed so great 
a Storm that many Ships were broken to pieces in the Havens, 
mighty Oaks rent up, and Houses overturned." Britton's comment: 
"Probably quite mythical." 

734				Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"... moon was as if it had been sprinkled with blood."

744				Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"... a red crucifix appeared in the heaven after sunset." The 
Anglo-Saxon Chronicles give the date as 743.

744				Ireland
O'Reilly (1902)
A terrible and frightening sign seen among the stars. 

745				Ireland
O'Reilly (1902)
Dragons were seen during the night.

745 January 1		Britain
Britton (1937) p. 25

"Fiery strokes were beheld in the air, such as no men of that 
generation had ever seen before and were visible throughout 
almost all the night of the first of January." Britton's 
comments: "Simeon of Durham appears to be the first native writer 
to mention this aurora. Tighernac, writing in Ireland a century 
later, is evidently alluding to it, as he has in 745 'In the 
night a marvellous and dreadful sign was seen in the stars.' Some 
later English and Irish writers date it 743. This event appears 
in Seller as 'great flashes of fire rising out of the Earth'.
There seems to have been other notable aurorae about this time. 
Tighernac has in 746 'Dragons were seen in the heavens' and in 
748 'Ships were seen in the air with their men'. In Fritz' list 
of dates of notable auroral activity all the years 740 to 745 are 
included. (Washington, D.C., Mon. Weath. Rev., 56, 1928, p.403."

"In the year 765 fiery strokes appeared in the air ..." Britton's 
comment: "Also mentioned by Tighernac."

773				Great Britain
Johnson (1880)
"In this year a red cross appeared in the heavens after sunset."

773				Britain
Britton (1937)
"In this year a red cross appeared in the heavens after sunset." 
Britton's comment: Several early writers mention this aurora with 
dates varying from 773 to 776." Clearly the same event and source 
as that mentioned by Johnson above.

776				British Isles
Lowe (1870)
Brilliant.

793				Northumbria, Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"... fiery dragons were seen flying in the air." Jeremiah says 
this is the earliest direct mention of an aurora in England.

793 				Europe

Newton (1972)
Dragon flames seen.

793				Great Britain
Johnson (1880)
"Fiery dragons were seen flying in the air." Saxon Chronicle.

793				Britain
Britton (1937)
"Very remarkable aurorae were seen in this year as the following 
accounts will shew:--
In this year dire forewarnings came over the land of the 
Northumbrians, and miserably terrified the people: these were 
excessive whirlwinds and lightnings, and fiery dragons were seen 
flying in the air. A great famine soon followed these tokens. 
[citing Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]
In the year 793, being the fourth year of the reign of king 
Ethelred, dreadful prodigies alarmed the wretched nation of the 
English, for terrific lightnings, and dragons in the air, and 
strokes of fire were seen hovering on high and shooting to and 
fro; which were ominous signs of the great famine ... [citing 
Roger of Howden]
In the tenth year of king Brithric, there were seen fiery dragons 
flying through the air which tokens were followed by two plagues; 
first, a dreadful famine, and then the pagan nations coming from 
Norway and Denmark. [citing Roger of Howden]
In this time of which I am speaking, there appeared signs in the 
country. First they were red, such as no man living had seen 
before; then spreading, they became as scarlet, and seemed near 
the earth. Then came great whirlwinds; then fiery flying dragons. 
And no one knew how to explain the storms and lightnings which 
men saw; some said that in their opinion they signified dear 
times; they did not speak a great untruth. [citing Geoffrey 
Gaimar]"
Britton's comment: "Fiery dragons is a usual term in early 
writers for phenomena which are clearly aurorae boreales."

Possibly 878.

879				Britain
Britton (1937) p. 33
Some phenomena (possibly auroral) noted by Short in this year. No 
earlier record found." Very doubtful.

889				Ireland
O'Reilly (1902)
The sky seemed to be on fire the night of the calends of January.
[This appears to be the same as the following one. The difference 
in year may be due to the year starting in March, with Jeremiah 
making the correction to the year starting on January 1.]

890 January		Britain
Jeremiah, 3 Nature 174 (1870)
"The heavens appeared to be on fire at night on the Kalends of 
January." Jeremiah also cites columns of light in 819, 850, 
probably not auroral, blood rains in 878, and the Loch changed 
into blood in 866. Also blood rain in 898.

890 January		Great Britain

"The heavens appeared to be on fire at night on the Kalends of 
January." Scottish Chronicle.

Scotland and fiery torches in the air." Britton comment: "No 
original reference for these phenomena found."

916				Ireland
O'Reilly (1902)
Terrible signs. A mass of fire, accompanied by thunder, in the 
sky went from west to east across Ireland. [May not be aurora, 
description reads like lightning storm.]

917				Ireland
Britton (1937) p. 70
" Annals of Ulster ... Burning comets were seen in the sky." 
Britton comment: "Their date is 916 or 917. Later they refer to 
these 'burning comets' as 'burning flames' and they may possibly 
intend an aurora." Compare with O'Reilly above.

919 Winter		Russia

"... a bloody cloud, oftentimes in the likeness of fire; and it 
was mostly apparent at midnight, and so in various beams was 
coloured. When it began to dawn, then it glided away." Florence 
of Worcester gives the date as 14 April 978. The Anglo-Saxon 
Chronicle gives the year as 979.

Very brilliant.

979				England

"Simeon of Durham: After this, a cloud appeared at midnight 
throughout all England, at one time of a bloody, at another of a 
fiery, appearance, which afterwards changed to various hues and 
colours: it disappeared towards dawn." Britton comment: "Several 
early writers note this, the years varying from 978 to 979. The 
Annals of Waverley quote an exact date, October 28, 979, 
apparently from Siegbert, which evidently refers to the same 
appearance."

Britton (1937) p. 44
"Gaimar records: But in coming from Normandy some of his people 
perished in the sea. In this year, truly, several people saw a 
sign; in appearance it was fire: it flamed and burned fiercely in 
the air; it came near to the earth, and for a little time quite 
illuminated it; afterwards it revolved and ascended up on high, 
then descended into the bottom of the sea; in several places it 
burned woods and plains. There was no man who knew with certainty 
what this divined, nor what this sign signified. In the country 
of the Northumbrians this fire showed itself; and in two seasons 
of one year were these demonstrations." Britton comment: "Anglo-
Saxon Chronicle gives the date of the return from Normandy as

"Simeon of Durham records on September 29, 1907: A star called a 
comet appeared on the third of the kalends of October for fifteen 
days: some affirmed that at that time they saw in the heavens a 
wonderful sign like a burning cross.

"On September 27, 1908, he records: An unusual light shone 
throughout almost the whole night on the fifth of the kalends of 
October." Britton comments: "Other early writers refer to both of 
these phenomena and it is quite possible that there was a bright 
auroral display in both years. The almost exact coincidence of 
dates, however, involves the possibility that the same event has 
been entered to both years.

fought against it as if it would quench it; but the fire

death, viz., the dark night became bright from dusk till morning, 
and it appeared to the inhabitants that the adjacent parts of the 
globe were illuminated; and a large body of fire moved over the 
town and remained in the south east; and all the people rose from 
their beds, for they thought it was the day; and it continued so 
eastward along the sea.

"This aurora was also seen in England. Gervase of Canterbury 
records: On the 4th of the ides of February there appeared some 
time after midnight a wonderful sign in the sky. For a certain 
red color was seen in the air in the northerly regions between 
east and west. White rays also were traversing this redness, now 
slender like spears, now broad like tables, and now here and now 
there as if erected upwards from earth to heaven. The aforesaid 
white rays were like beams of the sun penetrating the thickest 
clouds." Britton comment: "The Scottish annalist Fordun mentions 
the phenomenon but he is probably deriving it from the English 
writers.

the whole of England."

Botley terms this a sporadic aurora. Based on some late

Britton (1937) p. 73

"William of Newburgh: For in the month of January, in the year in 
which the king fell into the hands of the enemy, we beheld a 
terrible portent in the sky, no doubt indicative of the 
affliction which was coming upon us. For about the first watch of 
the night, the intermediate region of the air between north and 
east grew so red that it appeared to blaze, as it were; though 
there was not the slightest cloud, and the stars were brightly 
shining; and these, too, were so tinged with fiery redness, and 
streaked with white stripes, that they seemed to twinkle with a 
kind of blood-stained light. After this dreadful appearance had 
possessed the minds and eyes of the beholders with astonishment 
throughout all the borders of England, for nearly the space of 
two hours, by degrees gently vanishing, it disappeared, leaving 
much conjecture concerning it." Britton comments: "Some early 
writers give 1193 and Holinshed cites it in 1194, but 1192 would 
appear to be the correct year." 

1193 February		England
Britton (1937) p. 74
William of Newburgh: And in the month of February in the 
following year, while the king of England was yet detained in 
Germany, and the news of his captivity was not generally known in 
England, a portent very similar appeared throughout England, in 
the same region of the sky soon after midnight, when the 
religious orders were chanting their customary praises to God. We 
know that persons in different provinces were so terrified by the 
reflection of this tremendous redness on their glass windows, 
that many of them, supposing that some accidental fire had 
happened in the adjoining houses, left their chanting, and, 
marking the dreadful portent, returned to their psalmody. While 
many conjectures were formed on this repeated portent, the news 
of the king's captivity became suddenly rife."

1193 November 2	England
Britton (1937) p. 74
"William of Newburgh: And, indeed, in that same year, when the 
king's detention had now become prolonged in Germany, and his 
speedy release was expected, on the fourth of the nones of 
November, before daybreak, the selfsame token appearing for the 
third time in the same region of the sky, terrified (but in a 
less degree) the minds of the beholders; for now they were 
accustomed to it, though it was the cause of increased conjecture 
and suspicion."

"de Taxter: There was red light in the sky like fire on the

aurora.

"Roger of Wendover has a fantastic account of two immense snakes 
fighting in the air, and one overcoming the other. This is

serpents fighting in the air is a very usual term in old writers 
to describe auroral appearances." Britton lists this as a 
questionable aurora.

1236 May 1		Yorkshire, England

"Short refers to a prodigy which was seen at 'Rochabbay' in

might be an aurora borealis."

"Matthew Paris: Indeed, in the night of the Lord's Circumcision, 
at midnight, the air being most serene, and the sky covered with 
stars, the moon being eight days old, there appeared in the air, 
marvellous to relate, a kind of large ship, elegantly shaped, 
equipped and of marvellous color. Certan monks of St. Albans saw 
this appearance, being at St. Amphibalus' to commemorate the 
festival, and looking at the stars to see if it was yet the hour 
for singing mattins, and they called together all of their 
familiar friends who were in the house to see the marvel. It 
appeared for a long time as if it were painted and in truth a 
ship made of planks, but finally it began to disappear: whence it 
was believed to be a cloud but a marvellous and prodigious one."

early in the morning of January 1."

very doubtful.

many beholders a wonderful sign. For a certain pile of fire of 
the size and shape of a small boat, pallid, but of a livid 
colour, rising up from the south and crossing the firmament with 
a slow and grave motion, set its course towards the north. Out of 
the front of this pile another very fervent fire of a red colour 
and of greater quantity, similar in shape to the former, burst 
forth immediately with bright beams and great speed, flying 
through the air, which were seen quickly meeting against each 
other by many beholders. And by turns frequently approaching with 
collisions and engaging in fearful combat, the blows of which 
conflict and the sounds of the crashes were heard at a distance 
from the beholders ... "

went out, one of which was crowned with a warlike sign, and the 
other was clothed in black. And a second time the warriors 
overcame the blacks, and returned to their tower, and the whole 
vanished." Britton comment: "Some later writers have this in 1361 
or 1362."
"Eulogium Historiarum, a later chronicle, has under date February 
25, 1361, the following note: In this year on the 25th February

luminous cloud like fire, and in the brightness of it were seen 
men ... ." Britton comment: "Whether the undoubted aurora 
described in the later extract is the same as the one referred to

as questionable.

the shape of a head in the south part of the heavens, stretching 
out to the northern quarter, which flew away, dividing itself 
into three parts, and travelled in the air like a bird of the 
woods in flight. At length they joined in one and suddenly 
disappeared." Britton considers aurora questionable.

various places, throughout the months of November and December. 
... And some appeared in the form of a burning revolving wheel, 
others again in the form of a round barrel of flame emitting fire

From the description I consider this very probable.

Hellman (1921) p. 16, 48

Woodcut shows the sun with a blood red horizontal stripe. 
Underneath this two groups of horsemen assaulting each other. At 
sunrise bloody streaks, then battling horsemen. This may be a
