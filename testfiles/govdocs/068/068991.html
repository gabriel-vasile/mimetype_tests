        <p><b><cite>Freud</cite></b> (Universal, 1962). Director: John Huston. 
          Writers: Charles Kaufman, Wolfgang Reinhardt. Cast: Montgomery Clift, 
          Larry Parks, Susannah York, Eileen Herlie. (120 min., sd., b&w, 35mm; 
          LC Collection, courtesy Universal), <i>preceded by</i><br>
          <b><cite>Let There Be Light</cite></b> (U.S. Army, 1946). Director: 
          John Huston. Writers: John Huston, Charles Kaufman. Narrator: Walter 
          Huston. (58 min., sd., b&w, 16mm; print courtesy of the National Archives) 
        </p>
        <blockquote>John Huston’s film is a clear, well structured, though somewhat 
          expurgated overview of Freud’s early theories and the resistance of 
          his contemporaries to some of his ground breaking ideas, particularly 
          regarding the existence of sexual impulses in infancy. Clift’s serious, 
          respectful portrayal of Sigmund Freud avoids caricature and Susannah 
          York artfully plays his attractive guinea pig, a fictional amalgam of 
          several of Freud’s female patients. Jean-Paul Sartre contributed two 
          early drafts of the screenplay, some of which even ends up on screen. 
          Huston saw first hand how neurotic symptoms can be triggered by a traumatic 
          event while making the documentary Let There Be Light (about WWII veterans 
          recovering from what was then called "shell shock") and that understanding 
          is clearly evident here. </blockquote>

        <p><b>Tuesday, October 20 (7:00 p.m.)</b> </p>
        <p><b><cite>Secrets of the Soul</cite></b> (Neumann Film/UFA, 1926). Director: 
          G.W. Pabst. Writers: Colin Ross and Hans Neumann. Cast: Werner Krauss, 
          Ruth Weyher, Pawel Pawlow, Jack Trevor. (95 min., si., b&w, 16mm; LC 
          Collection). </p>
        <blockquote>It has often been argued that psychoanalysis and expressionism 
          have the same roots in the cultural explosion in central Europe at the 
          end of the nineteenth century, and the works of Robert Wiene, Robert 
          Siodmak, and Alfred Hitchcock (trained in Germany), are deeply influenced 
          by the subjectivism that is central to both movements. How deeply this 
          tradition runs in German film is shown in Secrets of the Soul. Pabst 
          is usually considered as an upholder of a realistic tradition in German 
          films, yet he puts into brilliant narrative form this story of the analysis 
          of a man's neurosis. Pabst's film is still one the few real attempts 
          to use cinema to explicate Freudian psychology honestly and intelligently 
          without resorting the hokum usually found in later Hollywood films. 
          The optical effects in the dream sequences, photographed by Guido Seeber 
          and Kurt Oertel, and their use of Ernö Metzner's sets, are marvelous. 
          Werner Krauss's portrayal of the protagonist Fellman is still fresh 
          and sympathetic. For a wonderful contrast of German idealism (Freud) 
          and Soviet materialism (Pavlov), compare this film to Pudhovkin's Mechanics 
          of the Brain. </blockquote>
        <p><b>Wednesday, October 21 (7:00 p.m.)</b> </p>
        <p><b><cite>King of Hearts</cite></b> (United Artists, 1966). Director: 
          Philippe de Broca. Writer: Daniel Boulanger. Cast: Alan Bates, Genevi&egrave;ve 
          Bujold, Jean-Claude Brialy, Fran&ccedil;ois Christophe. (102 min., sd., 
          color, 35mm; LC Collection), <i>preceded by</i><br>
          <b><cite>The Escaped Lunatic</cite></b> (American Mutoscope & Biograph, 
          1904). Camera: A.E. Weed. (7 min., si., b&w, 16mm; LC Paper Print Collection). 
        </p>
        <blockquote>Though it was a commercial failure and received mixed notices 
          when it was released, <cite>King of Hearts</cite> has become a cult 
          classic, playing revival theaters, the college circuit, and for years 
          at a theater in Cambridge, MA. The antiwar sentiments certainly contribute 
          to the enduring popularity of the film, but doubtless there are other 
          reasons. Shot in Senlis, France and set in the latter part of World 
          War I, the fleeing Germans in an attempt to slow their pursuers set 
          a booby trap in the center of the village square -- triggered to explode 
          when an armored knight on the church steeple clock strikes the midnight 
          hour with his mace. The townspeople, hearing the news, flee, leaving 
          behind the inmates of the local insane asylum. And so it goes... the 
          inmates take over the asylum, though in this case it's the village. 
          There follows an enchanting carnival of events -- marked by unreality, 
          delusion, and exhibitionism acted out by charming lunatics. And finally, 
          in the midst of the horror and carnage of war, we are helplessly drawn 
          to those who seem to have consciously chosen their "vagrant lunacy."

        <p><b>Thursday, October 22 (7:00 p.m.)</b> </p>
        <p><b><cite>Spellbound</cite></b> (Selznick Productions, 1945). Director: 
          Alfred Hitchcock. Writer: Ben Hecht, based on the novel "The House of 
          Dr. Edwardes" by Francis Beeding. Cast: Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, 
          Leo G. Carroll, John Emery, Michael Chekhov. (111 min., sd., b&w, 35mm; 
          LC Collection). </p>
        <blockquote>Although Hitchcock dealt with psychological themes in many 
          of his films, <cite>Spellbound</cite> was the most overtly Freudian 
          of his work. A psychiatrist at a mental hospital (Ingrid Bergman) falls 
          in love with the newly-arrived director, only to discover that he is, 
          in reality, a mental patient suffering from amnesia who has assumed 
          the role of the director and who may have killed him. The doctor seeks 
          to cure him by using dream analysis as she helps him elude the police. 
          While not Hitchcock's best work, Spellbound does offer a stellar performance 
          by Bergman, who is transformed by love from being rational and aloof 
          to being a fully integrated person. The film is also worth seeing for 
          the famous dream sequence by Salvador Dali, which depicted the dream 
          world in a wholly unique way from previous films. </blockquote>

          courtesy BBC). </p>
        <blockquote>Tonight's program features two radically different takes on 
          the oedipal story, and a further indication of how central that narrative 
          has become to our storytelling. In <cite>Oedipus Wrecks</cite> -- the 
          only watchable installment of the <cite>New York Stories</cite> trilogy 
          -- Woody Allen is literally haunted by Great Jewish Mother in the Sky 
          Mae Questel. Broadly comic in the manner of his "earlier, funnier" films, 
          this vignette is still deeply rooted in myth, as Woody can't shake the 
          spectral mother until he falls in love with a woman just like her.<br>
          <cite>Schmoedipus</cite>is a BBC teleplay from the late, lamented Dennis 
          Potter (<cite>The Singing Detective, Pennies From Heaven</cite>). Anna 
          Cropper is trapped in an bitter, childless marriage to man obsessed 
          with toy trains. Tim Curry mysteriously appears at her door, claiming 
          to be her long lost baby; he now wants to claim the idyllic English 
          childhood he never had. Rewritten by Potter as the film <cite>Track 
          29</cite>, this is a caustic tale of emotional repression and the chasm 
          between childish wonder and infantile delusion. </blockquote>

        </p>
        <blockquote>Private eye Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is hired by recently widowed 
          Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway) to find out who murdered her husband, the former 
          business partner of her father, the insatiable capitalist Noah Cross 
          (Huston). As he is drawn into the mystery, Gittes gets further and further 
          out of his depth, dogged by a past he is compelled to repeat. This is 
          a Chandleresque variant of the Oedipus myth transplanted to 1930s Los 
          Angeles. In a city blighted by drought, incest is punished by a bullet 
          in the eye, prefigured by a broken tail light and a flaw in the iris. 
          Robert Towne’s literate script investigating political and personal 
          corruption is infused with Polanski’s keen attention to detail and fatalistic 
          sense of the absurd. <cite>Chinatown</cite> is preceded by <cite>Mia 
          and Roman</cite>, a short featurette shot during the making of Polanski’s 
          first Hollywood film, <cite>Rosemary’s Baby</cite>. </blockquote>

          b&w, 35mm; LC Collection, courtesy Universal). </p>
        <blockquote>Laurence Olivier’s assured adaption of Shakespeare’s tragedy 
          of the Danish prince who is driven to avenge his father’s murder. The 
          dead king and the usurper become positive and negative aspects of the 
          father figure. Olivier amplifies the Oedipal nature of the troubled 
          Dane’s predicament by dwelling on the carnal kisses which Hamlet exchanges 
          with his mother, making the film a clear example of how Freud has influenced 
          our reading of familiar texts. </blockquote>

        <p><b><cite>The Seventh Veil</cite></b> (Universal, 1945). Director: Compton 
          Bennett. Writers: Muriel and Sydney Box. Cast: James Mason, Ann Todd,

          Judd Hirsch, Andy Kaufman, Danny DeVito, Marilu Henner, Tony Danza, 
          Christopher Lloyd, Barry Nelson. Telecast: ABC, October 22, 1981. (24 
          min., sd., color, 16mm; LC Collection, courtesy Paramount). </p>
        <blockquote>A young woman is raised by a misogynistic, Svengali-like guardian 
          (James Mason), who fashions her into a concert pianist. An accident 
          which burns her hands leaves her suicidal, convinced that she will never 
          play the piano again. Certain that her wounds are more psychological 
          than physical, a psychiatrist uses hypnosis to help her discover her 
          real feelings about the men in her life, including her guardian, which 
          is the key to her being able to play music again. This British film 
          contains several Freudian elements: psychoanalysis, unresolved oedipal 
          conflicts, and the ongoing struggle between love and aggression. "The 
          seventh veil" refers to the part of one's psyche that one does not show 
          to anyone, except the psychoanalyst. In <cite>Taxi: Mr. Personalities</cite>, 
          the late, lamented Andy Kaufman stars as garage mechanic Latka Gravas, 
          who in this episode is afflicted with multiple personalities, including 
          Arlo the cowboy, ultra-smooth Vic Ferrari, and -- most amusingly -- 
          Alex Reiger, the character played by Judd Hirsch. Both Alexes seek the 
          help of psychiatrist Barry Nelson, but Latka/Alex seems to have more 
          personal insight than does the real version. </blockquote>

        <blockquote> 
          <p><cite>Deluxe Annie</cite> is a dark tale of crime and fraud in which 
            a young wife and mother loses her identity after suffering a head 
            injury. Mrs Kendall (Norma Talmadge) develops anxiety over her husband’s 
            fascination with criminology and dreams that he has been shot while 
            pursuing <cite>Deluxe Annie</cite>, a black-mailing book agent, and 
            her accomplice Jimmy Fitzgerald. Unable to shake off her fears, Mrs. 
            Kendall leaves her country residence to warn her husband, who has 
            gone to their city home in order to frame the criminals in the act.</p>
          <p>As Mrs. Kendall enters the basement of her city home, the crooks 
            knock her out and beat her violently till she looses consciousness. 
            With no recollection of the past, she wanders into the world of darkness 
            and fog. Ironically, the crook Jimmy Fitzgerald discovers Kendall, 
            now under the assumed identity of Nan, in a Chicago boardinghouse. 
            When the sly Nan pleads mercy after being accused of stealing Jimmy’s 
            watch and money, he admires her keen knack for lying and makes her 
            his new partner in the “deluxe book game.”</p>
          <p>Produced by Lewis J. Selznick during the early years of The Classical 
            Hollywood Cinema, <cite>Deluxe Annie</cite> features expressive lighting 
            effects in a range of interior and exterior locations, which set the 
            tone for the film’s images of violence and crime. Actress Norma Talmadge, 
            often overlooked by film historians despite her status as a major 
            star in 1917, offers her unique brand of the brave, tragic, and sacrificing 
            heroine who eventually attains redemption at the end.</p>
          <p>Like the stage magician, the hypnotist featured in traveling medicine 
            shows and vaudeville acts became the subject of early motion picture 
            narratives. As a figure aligned with both science and magic, the hypnotist 
            publicly displayed his power to manipulate the will and actions of 
            innocent individuals. In <cite>The Hypnotist's Revenge</cite>, Professor 
            Stillman, a stage hypnotist, disguises himself in order to put Chappy, 
            an innocent non-believer, in a trance. In a series of diverse social 
            settings -- a church wedding, a fancy dinner party, and at a dance 
            hall -- Chappy makes a fool of himself with his unconventional and 
            unruly behavior.<br>
            In <cite>Hypnotic Hick</cite>, Woody Woodpecker breaks the law when 
            he discovers the power of hypnotism and uses it to out-smart arch-rival 
            Buzz Buzzard. </p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p>The Pickford embraces surrealism in tonight's double feature. Inspired 
            by Freud’s <cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite>, the Surrealists 
            set out to explore the new aesthetic language of the subconscious, 
            most directly accessible through dream. In <cite>Un Chien Andalou</cite>, 
            the most notorious Surrealist film, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and collaborator 
            Salvador Dali realized that here was a perfect medium to convey the 
            transient imagery of dreams. Heeding Andr&eacute;s Breton’s call to 
            fuse 'dream and reality into an absolute or 'super reality’”, they 
            introduced a powerful new way to organize film images. The film caused 
            a riot during its initial screening and it has lost none of its capacity 
            to startle.</p>
          <p>David Lynch reinvented Surrealism with <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, a 
            weird, otherworldly primer on parenting which follows Henry (Jack 
            Nance) and his spastic wife’s struggle to care for their deformed 
            baby. Lynch has imagined a nightmare landscape of primordial progenitive 
            expulsion and industrial decay. Heaven is represented by a baby faced 
            lady in the radiator who giggles like Betty Boop while squashing oversized 
            spermatozoa under her heel. An impressive first feature by any standard.

        <blockquote>Swedish director Ingmar Bergman spent a significant portion 
          of his career exploring psychoanalytic themes in a far more explicit 
          manner than had hitherto been seen on the world screen. Beginning his 
          career with such dramas of social realism as <cite>Summer with Monica</cite>, 
          in the late 1950s he turned toward spiritual themes with such films 
          as <cite>The Seventh Seal</cite>, before finally reaching a point of 
          disillusionment in such pictures as <cite>Winter Light</cite>. Then, 
          during the 1960s, he began an intensive examination of the world of 
          the mind, treated in a simultaneously realistic and symbolic manner, 
          as in <cite>Persona</cite> and <cite>Cries and Whispers</cite>. Bergman 
          became internationally acclaimed for having created a new existential 
          cinema of the mind, although since the 1980s his reputation has been 
          in eclipse. Face to Face was originally filmed as a four-part Swedish 
          television series of 50 min. segments, following the pattern of Bergman's 
          previous <cite>Scenes From a Marriage</cite>. When it proved impossible 
          to broadcast on American television, Bergman cut it into feature form 
          for theatrical distribution. Psychiatrist Liv Ullmann spends her vacation 
          away from her husband and daughter at the home of her grandparents, 
          where, haunted by a chimera of an old woman, she suffers a breakdown 
          and attempts suicide through a drug overdose. During her hallucinogenic 
          recovery, she relives portions of her childhood and realizes that family 
          disputes formed much of her rigid character, a recognition that allows 
          her to begin her own recovery. </blockquote>

          <p>In the popular mind, somnambulism became associated with hypnotism 
            and came to refer not just to a sleepwalker, but also to a person 
            in a trance under the control of another individual. Freud was intrigued 
            by the possibilities of hypnosis, but ultimately abandoned it as an 
            ineffective treatment. It did, however, point Freud to the concept 
            of an unconscious state where one could do things which were impossible

            hypnotism by showing a professor who attempts to hypnotize a young 
            woman into stealing money for him. In <cite>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</cite>, 
            an evil doctor displays a somnambulist as a carnival attraction. It 
            soon becomes apparent to the young man narrating the story that the

        </p>
        <blockquote><cite>Peeping Tom</cite> critically examines the role of the 
          artist and the inner demons that both torment him and which he tries 
          to extend to others. The protagonist is a victim of child abuse, the 
          object of his father's bizarre experiments to induce fear in his son 
          through terrifying him in various ways, clinically recording the results 
          on film. In turn, the son is compulsively repeating, in modified form, 
          what was inflicted on him, through his work as a cameraman and fulfilling 
          a scopophiliac obsession with photographing the gruesome. By night his 
          obsessive compulsion is continued by impaling prostitutes with the spiked 
          leg of his camera, filming their death and allowing them to simultaneously 
          see it through a mirror. Through making the very instrument of filmmaking 
          into a murder weapon, director Michael Powell speculates on the voyeuristic 
          role of the filmmaker and its psychological effects on both himself 
          and spectators. Seldom has a filmmaker so harshly examined the terrifying 
          potential of his own art or the degree to which he is responsible for 
          its consequences (Powell also plays the psychotic father). Although 
          misunderstood upon its limited original release as a slasher film of 
          virtually pornographic content, today Peeping Tom is regarded as a classic 
          of referentiality and an exposé of the patriarchal gaze which forms 
          the basis of narrative filmmaking. </blockquote>

          Seberg, Peter Fonda, Kim Hunter, Gene Hackman. (114 min., sd., b&w, 
          35mm; LC Collection, courtesy Columbia). </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Lilith is one of those rare films that has worn well. Madness, obsession, 
            nymphomania, implied incest, schizophrenia and narcissism are vividly 
            yet artfully presented in a film that made audiences and critics, 
            even during the socially awakening early sixties, extremely uncomfortable. 
            Today, it is difficult to understand why the public reacted so violently 
            against this extraordinarily beautiful and intelligent film. But it 
            is interesting to consider that the critical response to this film 
            was in many ways strikingly similar to the public reaction, in rigid 
            turn-of-the-century Vienna, to the theories and public discourses 
            of Sigmund Freud, who sought to shed a rational and compassionate 
            light on many of the dark obsessions explored here. For many, Lilith 
            is a lot more engaging than Freud's discourses. Shot in Rockville 
            and Great Falls, Maryland, Lilith is set in a posh asylum for wealthy 
            schizophrenics where beautifully cultivated gardens, fountains, rolling 
            lawns, and people strolling in the sun or sitting quietly reading, 
            create an illusion of absolute peace. This serene backdrop illuminates 
            the profound complexities and sometimes savage intensities of the 
            inmates and the staff -- and the central argument that madness is 
            a two-way mirror, depending on whether you are examining what it looks 
            like or what it feels like. A fabulous original jazz score by Kenyon 
            Hopkins is a stunning compliment companion to Gene Shufftan's hypnotic 
            and lyrical imagery. </p>
          <p>This was the final film in Robert Rossen's thirty-year career -- 
            he died a little over a year after its release. Regrettably, Rossen 
            received only derision and harsh criticism for Lilith -- a film which 
            stands alone in his cannon not only for it's beauty, but also as a 
            remarkable departure from his earlier work. One wonders what he might 
            have done next. </p>

          Peyton Place in a sanitarium, the film deals less with the patients 
          and more with the staff's personal problems. Widmark is the prototypical 
          psychiatrist who can cure others, yet is distracted by a crumbling marriage, 
          while Boyer is the washed-up analyst who masks his womanizing behind 
          a fog of therapeutic jargon. In fact, it's rather difficult to distinguish 
          inmate from staff for the first thirty minutes of the film, which is 
          precisely the way director Minnelli intended. Please note that this

          <p>Oedipal obsession figures prominently in <cite>Blind Alley</cite>, 
            one of Hollywood's first attempts to illustrate psychoanalytic practice. 
            Fugitive Morris and his gang hide out in the home of psychology professor

            in an attempt to understand the meaning of a disturbing dream. Bellamy's 
            character is a pipe-smoking, godlike figure, preternaturally calm 
            in the face of mayhem, confident in his ability to expose the source 
            of criminal pathology (he tells his wife, "I'm going to destroy him, 
            take his brain apart and show him the pieces"). If Hollywood tended

          psychiatrist who tells an unhappy wife she is an "intuitive introvert" 
          while her husband is an "infantile extrovert;" this prompts her to immediately

          <p>It’s a doppelg&auml;nger doppel feature at the Mary Pickford Theater. 
            Tonight’s first film, <cite>The Case of Becky</cite>, stars Blanche 
            Sweet as a young woman suffering from dual personality. Sweet, featured 
            in such D.W. Griffith classics as <cite>The Lonesdale Operator</cite> 
            (1911) and <cite>Judith of Bethulia</cite> (1913), here displays the 
            breadth and spontaneity of her acting ability, moving in and out of 
            character -- from Dorothy, a medium in The Great Balzamo’s hypnotism 
            act, to Becky, her dark, unruly, other self. As time increases Becky’s 
            strength, her demonic personality dominates Dorothy, who looses control 
            over her thoughts and actions. When a stroke of fate delivers Dorothy 
            into the hands of medical specialists, a young doctor with powers 
            to hypnotize measures his will against Balzamo’s, in a climatic dual 
            of good vs evil. In <cite>The Case of Becky</cite> hypnotism functions 
            as both a positive and negative form of power through its association 
            with stage magic, and as a cure for mental disease.</p>
          <p>The concept of the doppelg&auml;nger, a classic staple of German 
            literature and cinema, found a perfect outlet in the fatalistic dramas 
            of German expressionist filmmakers. As with other German emigres, 
            Robert Siodmak drew from the expressionist tradition to contribute 
            to the style and substance of Hollywood’s film noir genre. In <cite>The 
            Dark Mirror</cite>, the doppelgänger is literally a double -- a physically 
            identical but psychologically aberrant twin. When two eyewitnesses 
            identify Miss Collins (Olivia de Havilland) as the woman accompanying 
            Dr. Peralta shortly before he was murdered the previous evening, Detective 
            Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) thinks he has an open and shut case. However, 
            during questioning Miss Collins is able to provide a airtight alibi. 
            The conundrum is explained when Stevenson discovers that Terry Collins 
            has an identical twin -- Ruth. Without a confession, both are free 
            from prosecution. However, the adverse publicity costs them their 
            jobs. Twin expert, Dr. Scott Elliott (Lew Ayres) offers the sisters 
            a small fee to submit to psychological tests for his case studies 
            on twins and soon concludes that one of the sisters is insane.<br>
            Tonight's screenings will be introduced by Dr. John Flowers, professor 
            of psychology and director of the doctoral program at Chapman University. 
            A noted expert in group psychotherapy, his present scholarly focus 
            is on psychotherapists in the cinema, with special emphasis of the 
            changing portrayals over time. </p>

          <p>Psychiatrist George Brent falls in love with Hedy Lamarr, and must 
            rescue her and her son from the apparently kindly philanthropist husband 
            played by Paul Lukas, who is in fact a murderer insanely plotting 
            to drive her mad and kill her. Director Jacques Tourneur -- the son 
            of noted silent film director Maurice Tourneur -- was born in Paris 
            but largely reared and trained in Hollywood. He became one of the 
            leading directors of thrillers during the 1940s. Before directing 
            <cite>Experiment Perilous</cite>, he turned such horror films as <cite>Cat 
            People</cite> and <cite>The Leopard Man</cite> into explorations of 
            the terror of the mind as much as the supernatural. Afterward, Tourneur 
            shifted toward film noir with Out of the Past, even taking the swashbuckler 
            in a noir direction with <cite>The Flame and the Arrow</cite> and 
            <cite>Anne of the Indies</cite>. By the 1950s, Tourneur's career prematurely 
            fizzled, as he proved unable to adjust to changes in the industry, 
            but he had played a key role in bringing psychological themes to a

        <blockquote>Sidney Poitier stars as the movies' first African-American 
          psychiatrist in <cite>Pressure Point</cite>, which perhaps marks the 
          apogee of the "Golden Age" of psychiatric films, at least in its portrayal 
          of the therapist whose unquestioned professionalism is matched only 
          by his nobility as a human being. Poitier overcomes institutional and 
          personal hostility to uncover the root of patient Bobby Darin's racism, 
          yet bears the subsequent disapproval of his colleagues with grace. The 
          film blazes no new trails in its depiction of racist attitudes (producer 
          Stanley Kramer's Home of the Brave covered much the same ground in 1949), 
          but it is very well acted and beautifully photographed by Ernest Haller.<br>
          Allan Arbus guest stars in his recurring role as Army psychiatrist Sidney 
          Freedman, this time seeking to rejuvenate his spirits by writing a letter 
          to Freud about the "inmates" of the 4077th MASH. This episode of <cite>M*A*S*H</cite> 
          is a fine example of what made the show so watchable: humor mixed with 
          pathos and a dollop of heavy-handed moralizing. As Sidney notes, the 
          4077th has "an interesting defense against the carnage: insanity in 
          the service of health." </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Since the death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock 
          Holmes, writers have undertaken Holmesian pastiches at an exponentially 
          increasing rate. Screenwriter Nicholas Meyer, the son of a psychoanalyst, 
          began his own career as a filmmaker at age 9, making his own 8 mm movies. 
          He had the unique idea of pairing fiction's most individualistic cocaine-addicted 
          creation with the one man who might have been able to psychoanalyze 
          such an unusual character, his contemporary Sigmund Freud. The 32 year-old 
          Meyer received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay from 
          another medium for <cite>The Seven Per Cent Solution</cite>, basing 
          it on his own best-selling novel which also inspired two sequels. In 
          the story, a number of Holmes's eccentricities are revealed by Freud 
          to have a basis in childhood trauma, but the beloved detective retains 
          his magnetism through his continued unrivaled sleuthing ability. Not 
          only did Meyer's popular original sequel launch him on an important 
          filmmaking career which continues to this day, but it has influenced 
          a whole school of literary pastiches, Holmesian and otherwise, matching 
          fictional characters and real people in new fictional exploits. </blockquote>

            astonishingly original animation. Alice’s dream world is populated 
            by a surreal menagerie of invented creatures pieced together with 
            alchemic skill from everyday objects. Bones, buttons and taxidermied 
            animals are reassembled and brought vividly to life with the help 
            of heightened naturalistic sounds. The effect is at once fascinating 
            and unsettling. By adamantly refusing to romanticize childhood, Svankmajer’s 
            film adaption come the closest yet to capturing the contrary dream-logic 
            of the original.</p>

        <blockquote> Cannibalism, lobotomies, and the nature of God: who but Tennessee 
          Williams could weave such a tale, creating two bravura female roles 
          in the process, and all in one act? <cite>Suddenly, Last Summer</cite> 
          began as a monologue -- Catherine's climactic description of her cousin's 
          unusual demise -- called "And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens." 
          It was expanded into a one-act play and presented off-Broadway in 1958, 
          along with the curtain-raiser "Something Unspoken," under the title 
          "Garden District." Hortense Alden and Anne Meacham played Mrs. Venable 
          and Catherine, respectively; in a tour the following year, Cathleen 
          Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore assumed the roles. When Hollywood called, 
          Gore Vidal was hired to expand the play into a feature-length script. 
          To everyone's surprise, the film version, shot in England and released 
          late in 1959, was not condemned by the <cite>Legion of Decency</cite>, 
          even though Cousin Sebastian had been obviously gay (The Legion felt 
          he got his desserts). Variety, however, called the film "a weirdo by 
          any standard."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The lobotomy -- cutting nerves in the brain in an attempt 
          to cure mental illness -- was an experimental procedure in vogue from 
          the mid-1930s until the mid-1950s. Williams' beloved sister Rose was 
          lobotomized for schizophrenia, and spent the rest of her life in institutions. 
          Williams supported her until his death in 1983, and left the bulk of 
          his estate in trust for her. She died in 1996. </blockquote>

          Cast: Jennifer Jones, Jason Robards, Joan Fontaine, Tom Ewell. (146 
          min., sd., color, 35mm; LC Collection, courtesy 20th Century-Fox). </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><cite>Tender Is the Night</cite> is best appreciated less as an adaptation 
            of the Fitzgerald novel than as an original work. At the time it was 
            made (1962) many of Fitzgerald's themes were still considered beyond 
            what would be allowed on the screen. Instead, producer David O. Selznick 
            sought a vehicle to showcase his wife, actress Jennifer Jones, and 
            other stars were cast who were not ideal representations of the characters 
            Fitzgerald had imagined. Veteran director Henry King, whose career 
            dated back to the 1910s, had a long tenure as the leading house director 
            at 20th Century-Fox. With this film King had for the first time a 
            producer who attempted to dictate how shooting should be done; predictably, 
            he and Selznick clashed. The resulting long film satisfied neither 
            man, and it was the last film of both.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, <cite>Tender Is the Night</cite> memorably depicts the 
            crumbling of a talented man of promising future, played by Jason Robards 
            as therapist to wealthy Jones in a sanitarium. Against his better 
            judgement, the two fall in love and he agrees to marry her, despite 
            the breach of professional standards. Over the course of their marriage, 
            Robards loses his intellectual drive and becomes increasingly dependent 
            on Jones, who, although she had begun desperately needing his guidance 
            and love, gradually transforms. Jones becomes a strong, independent 
            woman, and ultimately leaves behind the man who began as her mentor 
            but who has lost the very qualities which attracted her to him. Yet 
            Jones's full recovery from sanitarium to be capable of life on her 
            own is a result of the same marriage that proved disastrous for Robards, 
            and the complex, shifting nature of power and ambition in their union, 
            and its personal outcome, provides an absorbing, cautionary romantic 
            parable. </p>

          <p>Obsessive love night at the Pickford Theater. After authorities banned 
            his anti-Stalinist film <cite>Hands UP!</cite> in 1967, director Jerzy 
            Skolimowski left his native Poland for a career in the West. Literally 
            awash in Freudian shadings and symbolism, the tragi-comic thriller 
            <cite>Deep End</cite> was Skolimowski's breakthrough English-language 
            feature. The deceptively simple story of two attendants in a decaying 
            London bathhouse is told in a style both relaxed and tense. Fifteen 
            year old Mike (John Moulder Brown) exudes a dangerous innocence in 
            his obsessive desire for Sue (Jane Asher), his older and more worldly 
            co-worker. Intensely dreamlike in its use of color and atmosphere, 
            Deep End's bathhouse becomes a hothouse for its characters' projections 
            and fantasies. As in Hitchcock and Powell, the color red is given 
            heightened importance, with all its deep-seated cultural and psychological 
            associations. The literal and metaphorical meanings of the film's 
            title inexorably come together in a shattering climax.</p>
          <p><cite>The Bob Newhart Show</cite> was designed especially for the 
            stand-up comedian because -- in the words of co-creator Lorenzo Davis 
            -- he "listens funny," but what made the program work was the delicate 
            balance it struck between Newhart's utterly grounded home life and 
            professional work with his quirky, albeit endearing, clients. In this 
            episode, the two worlds converge as Newhart is the object of unwanted 
            affection from one of his patients. Although "transference" is the 
            diagnosis, wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) is not convinced. </p>

            his ancestors. A misogynistic psychiatrist, Dr. Lytton (C. Aubrey 
            Smith) suggests Cesare exorcize his internal demons by writing a play 
            on the Borgias, but no sooner has he done so, and fallen in love with 
            leading lady Florence Ballau (Margaret Lindsay), than it appears she 
            is becoming her role--Lucretia Borgia. Florence is accused of murdering 
            her father, theatrical producer Victor Ballau, but in investigating 
            on her behalf, Cesare (in conjunction with psychiatrist Lytton) discovers 
            he is hardly alone in experiencing a deep psychological turmoil, uncovering 
            a maelstrom of revenge and bitterness stretching back over two decades.</p>
          <p>The consistently strange, unnatural behavior of each of the performers 
            is augmented by Florey's expressionistic treatment, with painterly 
            camerawork by Arthur Todd, full of oblique angles, dark lighting, 
            shadow effects, and composition in depth, heightening moments of drama 
            and character revelation. Many objets d'art from director Florey's 
            own collection enrich the set design and enhance the chilling mood 
            it creates. In a move seldom allowed contract directors, Warner Bros. 
            allowed Florey to oversee the editing of the film, so that pace, choice 
            of shots, and narrative all combine together to memorably explore 
            the psyche of its characters in a manner decades ahead of its time.<br>
            <cite>The Florentine Dagger</cite> will be introduced by Motion Picture, 
            Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division staff member Brian Taves, 
            author of Robert Florey, the French Expressionist (Scarecrow, 1987).</p>

        <blockquote>A bravura performance from Bea Arthur is featured in a wonderful 
          episode from the Norman Lear sitcom <cite>Maude</cite>. Maude Findlay 
          talks to an unseen (and unheard) therapist about her marriage, her father, 
          and her intense self-doubt. The husband-as-father parallel might be 
          a bit pat, but Arthur's serio-comic delivery more than compensates for 
          the predictability of the script. </blockquote>
