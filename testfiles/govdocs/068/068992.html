        <h3>About the Film Series</h3>
        <p> The film series to accompany the Library of Congress exhibition <cite>Sigmund 
          Freud: Conflict and Culture</cite> is an attempt to at least touch upon 
          the vast array of cinematic interpretations of Freudian thought. In 
          a sense, every film does this (as Christian Metz points out by likening 
          the language of cinema to Freud's notions of dreamwork), but we've taken 
          a more literal approach: almost all our presentations deal in some way 
          with the actual work of psychoanalysis as practiced by Freud. At its 
          most fundamental level, this includes such techniques as the "talking 
          cure" and free association, but also addresses central concepts like 
          the Oedipal myth and the interpretation of dreams. </p>
        <p>The series includes some obvious choices such as the John Huston <cite>Freud</cite> 
          biopic that opens the schedule on October 15, <cite>Spellbound</cite> 
          on October 22 (indeed, we could have chosen at least a dozen more Hitchcocks), 
          the great German expressionist masterpiece <cite>The Cabinet of Dr. 
          Caligari</cite> (November 17), and the highly amusing <cite>Seven Percent 
          Solution</cite> (December 15). Along the way, however, are some rarely 
          seen films from the Library's vast holdings: <cite>Deluxe Annie</cite> 
          (November 4) and <cite>The Case of Becky</cite> (December 3), two silent 
          era films about split personalities, <cite>Blind Alley</cite> (December 
          1), an important early work in which the psychiatrist is portrayed as 
          a godlike figure, as well as an assortment of shorts from the Paper 
          Print collection, home movies of Freud himself, cartoons, and television 
          episodes. </p>
        <p>In addition, we are delighted to debut two new prints from our Motion 
          Picture Preservation Lab. <cite>Free Love</cite> (December 2) marks 
          one of the very first appearances of a psychiatrist in an American film 
          (although, admittedly, he dispenses some awful advice), while <cite>The 
          Florentine Dagger</cite>, which closes the series on January 14, is 
          a striking explication of psychological turmoil reflected both in the 
          acting and set design. We will also feature a continuation of Friday 
          night National Film Registry screenings this season in addition to a 
          small series mounted in conjunction with the<cite> Israel at 50</cite> 
          exhibition. </p>
        <p> <b>RESERVATIONS</b> may be made by phone, beginning one week before 
          any given show. Call (202) 707-5677 during business hours (Monday-Friday,

          minutes before showtime, after which standbys will be admitted to unclaimed
