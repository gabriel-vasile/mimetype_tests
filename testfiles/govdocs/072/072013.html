            <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
    <p>Oak savanna covered some 11,000,000 to
    13,000,000 hectares of the Midwest at the time of settlement, extending over portions of
    Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.&nbsp;
    Definitions for the community vary between the states, due in part to different concepts
    of the presettlement appearance and structure of the community, a general lack of
    phytosociological data about oak savanna, and difficulty in interpreting historical
    data.&nbsp; Community definitions, a map of the real or potential distribution of
    presettlement oak savanna<b><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>,</b> and
    description and location of high quality savanna remnants, are presented for each
    state.&nbsp; In 1985, 113 sites totaling more than 2,607 hectares of relatively
    high-quality oak savanna were located in the Midwest, approximately 0.02 percent of the presettlement extent of the community.</p>
            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>The term savanna embraces a
    variety of related plant communities with world-wide distribution, occurring across the
    temperate and tropical regions, usually in association with grasslands (Eyre 1963, James
    and Kline 1949, Van Riper 1962).&nbsp; This community is generally defined as consisting
    of open-grown trees, growing as scattered individuals or in small groves, with an
    herbaceous, primarily grassy understory (Bray 1955).&nbsp; Bray emphasized that the
    community is neither a degraded forest nor an ecotone between taiga and tundra, as the two
    conditions necessary to meet the general definition for savanna (open-grown trees and
    grassy understory) do not occur in these situations.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Oak savanna is wide-spread in North
    America.&nbsp; A number of vegetation maps indicate the range of oak savanna throughout
    the United States (Bailey 1976; Carpenter 1940; Kuchler 1975; Lindsay 1953; Shreve 1917;
    Transeau 1935).&nbsp; Great variation in the extent of oak savanna occurs between the maps
    for similar areas. </p>
    <p>In general, oak savanna is distributed
    along the west coast and through the central portion of the United States. In both
    regions, savanna is essentially (not always) a transitional community located between
    areas of forest and grassland.&nbsp; In California and Oregon this is frequently a
    vertical transition, with savanna occurring from sea level to 900 meters, between valley
    grassland and mountain forests (Griffin 1977; Kagan 1983; Kuchler 1977; Thilenius
    1968).&nbsp; In the central part of the country the transition zone occurs between western
    prairie and eastern deciduous forest (Anderson 1983; Carpenter 1940; Daubenmire 1978;
    Dyksterhuis 1957; Kuchler 1975; Vankat 1979).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Midwest savanna is considered here to
    occur in the northern half of the central United States, a region encompassing Minnesota,
    Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.&nbsp; This paper reviews
    presettlement (prior to 1840) distribution of oak savanna in the Midwest and occurrences
    of high-quality or pristine remnants as of 1985.&nbsp; This paper presents published and
    unpublished information provided by individuals, agencies, and organizations within each
    state. As a result, there is a noticeable variation between the states in terms of
    definitions, classifications, and quality ranking systems.</p>
            <h4>PROBLEMS IN DEFINING SAVANNAS</h4>
    <p>Many definitions of Midwest oak
    savanna have been proposed, based on varying concepts of the community's presettlement
    distribution and composition.&nbsp; In the eastern prairie-forest transition zone, the
    presence of prairie, forest, or savanna communities was determined by local environmental
    factors, including fire, climate, topography and soil (Anderson 1983).&nbsp; Other factors
    may have included a relationship between savanna and &quot;coarse&quot; soil types
    (Whitford 1970) and frequent droughts (Drew 1973), and possibly browsing or grazing by
    large herbivores.&nbsp; Letters and journals of early settlers and explorers
    differentiated between prairie, barrens, and oak openings on the basis of physical
    appearance, the response of the communities to fire, and their geographical locations
    (Williams 1981).</p>
    <p>No single definition of Midwest oak
    savanna is universally accepted, and a multitude of terms have been applied including oak
    savanna, oak opening, oak barrens, scrub prairie, brush prairie, and brush savanna. In
    some states, most or all of these terms are used to indicate different aspects of a
    variable community.&nbsp; In other states, each is considered to be a separate community,
    or to be part of a forest or a prairie community.</p>
    <p>Factors that contribute to the lack of
    a unifying savanna include: 1) the variable physiognomy of the savanna community; 2) the
    transitional nature of oak savanna; 3) the difficulty in interpreting historical
    information; and 4) the general lack of phytosociological information concerning oak
    savanna.</p>
            <h4><i>Savanna Physiognomy</i></h4>
    <p><u><b>Variable appearance</b></u>. There
    appear to be two basic concepts of savanna appearance: open savanna and scrub
    savanna.&nbsp; Open savanna is a park-like community with widely-spaced trees, an
    herbaceous groundlayer, and virtually no shrub layer (Curtis 1959; Dyksterhuis 1957; Stout
    1944).&nbsp; Scrub savanna is composed of moderate to dense thickets of oak sprouts within
    a prairie matrix, with a few fairly dwarfed open-grown trees (Bray 1955; Grimm 1981,
    1984). The appearance of scrub savanna varies through both time and space, particularly as
    influenced by fire (Anderson 1983; Bray 1955; Curtis 1959; Grimm 1981, 1984).&nbsp; The
    same site, over a period of years, may resemble a brush prairie (grasses hiding the oak
    sprouts), a brush savanna (woody sprouts taller than the prairie grasses and forbs), or
    open savanna (a few large trees and the majority of sprouts shorter than the associated
    prairie vegetation).&nbsp; </p>
    <p><u><b>Origins.</b></u> Bray (1955), in a phytosociological study of Wisconsin savannas, attributed the difference between open and
    scrub savanna to their origins. &nbsp; He hypothesized that open savannas, usually
    dominated by bur oak (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>), evolved on sites where the original
    deciduous forests contained few or no sprout-forming oak species.&nbsp; These mesic
    forests were located primarily on rolling and well-drained flatlands.&nbsp; Following fire
    degradation of these forests during the second Xerothermic period, circa 400 to
    1000 A.D., prairie invaded from adjacent areas and, simultaneously or subsequently, bur
    oak invaded the prairie.&nbsp; The grub-forming ability of bur oak permitted the
    production of numerous sprouts, which occasionally developed into mature fire-resistant
    trees.&nbsp;The findings of Cottam (1949), Daubenmire (1978) and Gleason (1923) lend
    support to this hypothesis.&nbsp; A similar appearing savanna evolved when bur oak invaded
    sites that were historically dry prairie rather than forest.&nbsp; This process is
    currently being observed in Iowa along the Missouri River bluffs (Schennum 1984
    pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Scrub savanna also evolved during the
    second Xerothermic period, but on sites with oak species capable of resprouting,
    particularly <i>Quercus velutina, Q. ellipsoidalis,</i> and <i>Q. alba</i>.&nbsp; These
    forests developed primarily on hillsides and in areas of abrupt topography, where soil and
    light conditions hindered development of more mesic forests.&nbsp; The numerous grubs and
    stump sprouts from the fire-killed oaks formed a permanent brushland within the prairie
    matrix, with occasional trees attaining adult size.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In contrast to Bray's time frame for
    establishment of savanna in Wisconsin, around 400 to 1,000 A.D., Grimm (1981, 1983)
    presented evidence that in Minnesota oak savanna had existed as a community type since
    approximately 3000 to 400 B.C.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Support for Bray's theory concerning
    the occurrence of open and scrub savannas on different topographies can be found on many
    large-scale presettlement vegetation maps.&nbsp; Open savannas (generally dominated by bur
    oak) are usually depicted on the flatter, frequently mesic areas, and scrub savannas
    (usually characterized by white oak, black oak and hill's oak) are generally located on
    the dry to dry-mesic areas of steeper topography, particularly hillsides, dunes, and
    ridges (AuClair 1976; Bebb 1860; Bray 1955; Curtis 1959; Ewing 1924; Liegel 1982; Nee
    1969; Pepoon 1911; Sears 1926; Stout 1944; Tans 1976).</p>
    <p><u><b>Influence of fire.</b></u> Fire
    significantly influenced the development and appearance of both open and scrub savannas,
    but did not eliminate the oaks (Curtis 1959; Grimm 1984; Irving 1981). Depending on fire
    intensity and frequency, scrub savanna presented the appearance of prairie, brush prairie,
    brush savanna, or open savanna. &nbsp; Curtis (1959) described brush prairie remnants in
    southern Wisconsin, which were burned annually for more than 100 years with no observed
    reduction in the number of oak grubs present.&nbsp; Henderson (1982) documented that fire
    frequency influenced the appearance and structure of a <i>Quercus velutina</i> savanna in
    Indiana; frequent fires were usually of low intensity, rarely killed the overstory trees,
    and maintained an open understory, while infrequent fires were of high intensity, killed
    the large trees and stimulated dense sprouting, thus promoting the appearance of a thicket
    rather than an open savanna.&nbsp; Grimm (1981) pointed out that the number of oak sprouts
    from oak grubs generally increased with more frequent burning, creating denser
    thickets.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Numerous historical references have
    been made to the rapid conversion of savanna to oak forest following the cessation of
    prairie fires.&nbsp; Twenty to 40 years after settlement, both open and scrub savanna
    appeared as closed oak forests, a fact attributed to the presence of numerous grubs and
    sprouts in the originally open-appearing savannas (Bourne 1820 (cited in Grimm 1981);
    Cottam 1949; Curtis 1959; Grimm 1981; Muir 1913; Schroeder 1981; Stout 1944; Trewartha
    1940).</p>
            <h4><i>Transitional Community</i></h4>
    <p>Savanna is a transitional community
    between oak forest and prairie, usually arbitrarily separated from these communities by
    canopy cover and species composition.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p><u><b>Canopy Cover.</b></u> Tree density is
    the major variable used to distinguish savanna from prairie and forest
    communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Wisconsin, savanna is considered to occur where there is more
    than one tree per acre (2.5 trees per hectare) and less than 50 per cent canopy (Curtis
    1959), while in Missouri canopy levels of 10 per cent to 50 per cent are accepted (Nelson
    1985).&nbsp; In other states canopies of 10 to 80 percent are accepted as representing
    savannas (Wendt 1983, White and Madany 1978), while in Ohio a stand with nearly 100
    percent cover maybe considered a savanna (Anderson 1982). &nbsp; Above these cut-off
    points a stand is considered to be forest; below them the stand is regarded as
    prairie.&nbsp; However, other plant communities are included within this broad range, and
    canopy cover alone is insufficient to separate savanna from prairie or forest.</p>
    <p><u><b>Species Composition.</b></u> The understory vegetation of savanna is a mixture of both prairie and woodland species, with
    prairie forbs and grasses more abundant in areas of high light, and forest forbs and woody
    species in areas of low light (Bray 1958, 1960).&nbsp; In Wisconsin, oak savanna has a
    similarity index of 0.50 to 0.58 with prairie, and 0.53 with dry oak forest (Curtis 1959).
    In general, the savanna understory contains less grass and more forbs and shrubs than a
    prairie, but more grass and fewer forbs, vines, and shrubs than an oak forest (Bray 1960,
    Curtis 1959).&nbsp; No species is known to be endemic to oak savannas, and relatively few
    species are modal.&nbsp; In Wisconsin, only six species are considered modal in oak
    savanna: <i>Heliopsis helianthoides, Besseya bullii, Orobanche uniflora, Phlox glabberima,
    Ranunculus fascicularis,</i> and <i>Zygadenus elegans</i> (Curtis 1959). An additional
    four species, <i>Symphoricarpus occidentalis, Convolvulus americanus, Ceanothus americanus</i>
    and <i>Tephrosia virginiana</i> are &quot;almost limited in amplitude to savanna&quot;
    (Bray 1960).&nbsp; Packard (in press) suggests that oak savanna has a distinct herbaceous
    community characterized by species adapted to frequent large-scale disturbances, including
    species not generally considered to be part of a stable prairie or forest community.</p>
    <p>As a result, while prairie and forest
    can be separated from savanna, no definition that clearly separates savanna from prairie
    and forest has been developed. &nbsp; Community definitions accepted by the eight Midwest
    states are presented in a following section of this paper.</p>
            <h4><i>Historical Information</i></h4>
    <p>A third factor contributing to the
    confusion about savanna is the lack of historical records.&nbsp;&nbsp;No detailed accounts
    nor scientific studies of oak savanna prior to or near the time of settlement are
    known.&nbsp; The majority of historical information occurs in two forms--casual accounts
    of travelers and settlers, and reports made by the General Land Office (GLO) surveyors.</p>
    <p>Traveler accounts of the oak savanna
    region described the park-like setting of open savannas (Curtis 1959; Stout 1944; Chapman
    1984; Williams 1981). &nbsp; Curtis and Stout implied that this open character was
    representative of the presettlement landscape.&nbsp; However, as Grimm (1981) pointed out,
    these descriptions did not necessarily represent the vegetation of the region accurately,
    due to biases of the authors: 1)&nbsp;they may have selectively described only those
    regions considered &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;'unusual&quot;, and omitted mention of less
    noticeable landscapes, thus leading to a misrepresentation of the extent and character of
    oak savanna;&nbsp; 2) travel routes may have been selectively located in open savannas for
    ease of travel, and the writers assumed that the landscape along the travel route was
    representative of the region as a whole; 3) travelers may not have differentiated between
    similar appearing vegetation types, for example, scrub savanna, in which the grasses hid
    the oak sprouts, may have been described as prairie.</p>
    <p>Land survey records have been
    considered relatively accurate sources of information about presettlement vegetation, in
    part because the surveyors were required to travel straight lines without avoiding
    less-negotiable portions of a region (Grimm 1981). &nbsp; Difficulties in interpreting
    land survey records (Bourdo 1956; Cottam 1949; Grimm 1981' 1984; Noss 1985) include three
    sources of error of particular significance in relation to oak savanna:&nbsp; 1) due to a
    lack of a standardized terminology different surveyors used different terms for the same
    community and, conversely, used the same term to describe different vegetation types,
    including oak opening, oak barrens, oak scrub, brush prairie, scattered timber, open
    woodland, and prairie with scattered trees.&nbsp; 2) preferential selection of particular
    species and sizes of witness trees for longevity produced some bias in witness tree
    selection.&nbsp; Thus, witness trees did not necessarily represent the largest or nearest
    trees to the survey point, and may not have been representative of the actual tree
    composition of the landscape.&nbsp; 3) no standardized format existed for recording tree
    species.&nbsp; For example, &quot;b.&nbsp;oak&quot; may have referred to black oak (<i>Q. veultina</i>) or to bur oak (<i>Q. macrocarpa</i>), and &quot;yellow oak&quot; may have
    signified white oak (<i>Q. alba</i>), black oak (<i>Q. velutina</i>), hill's oak (<i>Q. ellipsoidalis</i>) or other species.</p>
    <p>A further problem in interpreting
    historical records occurs when the interpreter is biased.&nbsp; For example, if savanna is
    considered to be a prairie with widely spaced trees, then only descriptions matching this
    definition are recorded as savanna; descriptions of scrub savanna would be considered to
    refer to a different community (Curtis 1959).&nbsp; Additionally, when savanna is not
    recognized as a community type, it is not included on maps drawn from historical
    sources.&nbsp; This is noticeable in presettlement vegetation maps of Illinois (Anderson
    1970) and Missouri (Kucera 1961) which recorded only the presence of prairie and forest.</p>
    <p>In all cases, historical references
    are records only of what was observed at a certain place and time.&nbsp; Depending on
    local conditions, including fire regime, climatic factors, and settlement patterns, widely
    divergent descriptions of the same area could be (and sometimes were) recorded within a
    few years. </p>
            <h4><i>Phytosociological Data</i></h4>
    <p>Little scientific information exists
    about oak savanna.&nbsp; Bray (1955, 1958, 1960) conducted one of the few, and perhaps
    only, phytosociological studies of the Midwestern savanna, using data gathered in
    Wisconsin during the 1950's.&nbsp; Few high-quality stands remain to provide baseline
    data.&nbsp; Recent studies tend to document the condition of disturbed or altered savanna
    remnants, particularly as influenced by various management practices.</p>
            <h4><i>General Definition</i></h4>
    <p>Agencies, organizations and
    researchers in each state have adopted different criteria for oak savanna, resulting in a
    variety of definitions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In general, the various definitions
    for oak savanna agree that savanna is a community dominated by oaks having between 10 and
    80 percent canopy, with or without a shrub layer, with an herbaceous predominantly grassy
    groundlayer composed of species associated with both prairie and forest communities, and
    with the appearance of open and/or scrub savanna.&nbsp; Savanna is generally considered to
    be a fire-dependent community (Curtis 1959; Iffrig and Nelson 1983) and in the absence of
    fire (Grimm 1981; Curtis 1959), extreme drought conditions (Bray 1955; Drew 1973) or other
    unusual combination of factors (Whitford and Whitford 1971) rapidly converts to a forest
    or related community.</p>
            <h4>DEMISE AND 1985 EXTENT OF OAK
    SAVANNA</h4>
    <p>Although widespread at the time of
    settlement, oak savanna virtually disappeared within 20 to 40 years, a result of fire
    cessation and settler landuse patterns (Anderson 1982; Anderson 1983; Bacone and Campbell
    1980; Cottam 1949; Curtis 1959; DeForest 1922; Gleason 1923; Schroeder 1978; Smith 1975).</p>
    <p>Auclair (1976) documented the impact
    of settlement on oak savanna in south-central Wisconsin.&nbsp;In 1833 oak savanna occupied
    74 percent of the two-county study area, but by 1934 had essentially disappeared.&nbsp;
    Forty-two percent of the savannas (primarily <i>Quercus veultina</i> savannas, associated
    with sandy soil) were converted to cleared cropland; 36 percent (predominantly 
    <i>Quercus
    macrocarpa</i> savannas) were converted to permanent or temporary pasture; and the
    remaining 23 percent (primarily <i>Quercus alba</i> savannas, associated with driftless
    forest soil) developed into oak-hickory forests.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Fire was eliminated by plowing and
    grazing of savannas and prairies, and by construction of roads and railroads, all of which
    produced functional firebreaks. &nbsp; Johnson (1983, pers.&nbsp;comm.) determined by tree
    ring count that black oaks (<i>Quercus velutnia</i>) in a Northern Illinois black
    oak-white oak sand savanna began to grow two to three years after construction of roads in
    the area.</p>
    <p>Today very few high quality savannas
    remain in the Midwest.&nbsp; At the time of settlement oak savanna probably covered some
    11,000,000 to 13,000,000 hectares.&nbsp; In 1985 113 sites totaling 2,607 hectares of
    relatively high quality oak savanna remained, approximately 0.02 percent of the original
    extent. All but 40 hectares were on sandy, rocky or similarly droughty substrates.&nbsp;
    Information provided by each state indicated that no intact, high quality deep soil
    savanna had been located as of 1985.</p>
    <p>The survival of the dry and dry-mesic
    savannas is presumably related to their droughty soils. Some savannas, in particular those
    located on thin soil or rocky substrates, have been able to survive moderate grazing,
    exclusion of fire, and competition with alien and woody species.&nbsp; In some savannas
    light grazing has apparently helped to preserve the savanna by inhibiting woody invasion
    without eliminating the groundlayer. Other stands, particularly large sand savannas,
    survive because they have been burned relatively frequently by sparks from adjacent
    railroads, accidental fires, and prescribed fires.&nbsp; Thin and/or sterile soils limited
    agricultural use primarily to grazing. </p>
            <h4><i>State Definitions of Oak Savanna</i></h4>
    <p>For each of the eight Midwest states,
    a map indicating the location of savanna remnants is superimposed over the known or
    theorized extent of presettlement oak savanna, accompanied by accepted definitions for oak
    savanna, and a listing of savanna remnants indicating savanna type, quality rank, size and
    ownership. </p>
    <p>State maps of the presettlement range
    of oak savanna were developed primarily from published material.&nbsp; The majority of map
    makers located savanna by relating soil type, existing vegetation, and historical
    information (primarily GLO notes). &nbsp; The maps range from relatively accurate
    (Minnesota, Wisconsin, the northern counties of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan) to presumably
    inaccurate (Iowa).&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Community definitions within each
    state were drawn from both published and unpublished material, and reflect the definitions
    accepted by various agencies and organizations within each state.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Information about extant high quality
    remnant savannas was derived almost entirely from unpublished data provided by state
    agencies and natural heritage programs. Quality ranking systems vary from state to state,
    and are frequently subjective (Chapman 1984, pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp; In Illinois, the
    grade given to a savanna is heavily weighted towards the groundlayer regardless of
    overstory appearances (Madany 1977).&nbsp; In Indiana the herbaceous layer is similarly
    important in classifying the quality of the community: classification of a stand as a
    savanna is based on tree composition, and the quality rank is based on the herbaceous
    layer and woody structure (Homoya, 1984 pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp; No correlation of quality
    rank can be made between the states, as a site designated in one state as grade A or NA 1
    or high quality might be given an entirely different rank in another state, based on the
    criteria employed.&nbsp; </p>
            <h4><i>Minnesota</i></h4>
    <p>Marschner's detailed map &quot;The
    Original Vegetation of Minnesota&quot; (1974; &quot;Brushland&quot; region) is the most
    widely accepted source of information about the presettlement range of oak savanna in the
    state.&nbsp; Using GLO surveys, Marschner separately located &quot;oak openings and
    barrens&quot; and &quot;brush prairie&quot;, and included both in the general category of
    &quot;brushland&quot;. &nbsp; Marschner defined brush prairie as &quot;grass and brush
    with aspen, balm of gilead, and little oak and hazel in the north but mainly oak and hazel
    in the south&quot;. &nbsp; Heinselman (on the reverse of the 1974 edition of Marschner's
    map) interpreted this to be a &quot;fire maintained mosaic of low shrub thickets, patches
    of small trees, and bits of prairie, located between the true prairies and the forest
    region&quot;. &nbsp; Marschner defined &quot;oak openings and barrens&quot; as
    &quot;scattered trees and groves of oaks (mostly bur oaks) of scrubby form with some
    brush, thickets and occasionally with pine&quot;.&nbsp; Heinselmann considered that this
    community &quot;usually occurred as a buffer between prairie and big woods&quot;, often in
    association with sandy, droughty soils, and was closely analogous to the Oak Openings and
    Oak Barrens of Wisconsin:&nbsp; &quot;It consisted of oak groves or single trees (mostly
    bur oak-<i>Quercus macrocaprpa</i>) in a matrix of xeric tall-grass prairie.&quot;</p>
    <p>Using Marschner's map, Kratz and
    Jensen (1983) divided the state of Minnesota into eighteen natural divisions.&nbsp; Oak
    savanna occurred primarily in five of these regions and may have covered 1,829,750
    hectares at the time of settlement (Anon.&nbsp;table, in Wendt 1985).&nbsp; The 719,000
    hectare Mississippi River Sand Plains section had more than 75 percent cover of oak
    barrens and openings. Oak openings and barrens accounted for 25 to 75 percent of the
    1,659,000 hectare Southern Oak Barrens section in southeastern Minnesota. The adjacent
    274,000 hectare Blufflands section, the 1,113,000 hectare Leaf Hills section in western
    Minnesota, and the 457,000 hectare Blue Hills section in the central part of the state
    each had less than 25 percent cover of oak openings. The Minnesota Natural Heritage
    Program estimates that approximately 10 percent of the state, or some 2,200,000 hectares,
    was covered by oak savanna at the time of settlement (Wendt 1983, pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp;
    A higher figure of 2.4 million hectares is derived from Kuchler's (1975) map which
    included 202,350 hectares of aspen parkland and an unknown extent of pine barrens, as well
    as oak savanna.</p>
    <p>The Minnesota Natural Heritage Program
    within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources considers savanna to be any grassland
    community with trees occurring singly or in small groves, with canopy cover of 10 to 80
    percent, and recognizes the occurrence of three types of oak savanna in presettlement
    Minnesota (Wendt 1983). &nbsp; The bur oak-northern pin oak (<i>Quercus macrocarpa-Quercus
    ellipsoidalis</i>) savanna was most extensive and occurred on sandy soils in the central
    Mississippi River Sand Plains.&nbsp; Black oak-white oak savanna (<i>Quercus
    velutina-Quercus alba</i>) extended along the outwash terraces of the Mississippi River
    below Lake Pepin, in the Blufflands Region.&nbsp; Black soil savanna (characterized by Q.
    macrocarpa and other species) was confined to silt soils of the till plains of
    southern Minnesota. &nbsp; The community descriptions are in general agreement with, and
    in part based upon, Grimm's (1981) description of the presettlement savanna character:
    &quot;the prevailing physiognomy of the oak woodland was. scrub-a dense thicket of scrub
    oak and brush resembling chapparal.&nbsp; In many places patches or clumps of oak-scrub
    occurred in a parkland or groveland mosaic with grassland, but true savanna-widely
    scattered trees with an understory of grassland-was not widespread.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In January 1985 nine sites totaling
    more than 500 hectares of Grade A or B sand savanna had been located in Minnesota.&nbsp;
    No example of an intact black soil savanna is known to occur in the state.</p>
            <h4><i>Wisconsin</i></h4>
    <p>There are two state-wide presettlement
    vegetation maps for Wisconsin, both based on GLO records.&nbsp; Curtis's map &quot;The
    Original Vegetation of Wisconsin&quot; (1959) is the most widely referenced source of
    information concerning the presettlement location of savanna.&nbsp; To facilitate
    reduction of his map to a small scale, Curtis omitted areas of a community that covered
    less than a township (9324 hectares).</p>
    <p>Curtis indicated that open savanna was
    the characteristic landscape of much of southern Wisconsin, as did Stout (1944).&nbsp;
    Both are frequently cited sources that have strongly influenced the concept of how
    presettlement savanna appeared. &nbsp; Curtis differentiated 2,200,000 hectares of oak
    opening (chiefly <i>Quercus macrocarpa, Q. alba, Q. velutina,</i> and <i>Q. bicolor</i>)
    from 728,000 hectares of oak barrens (primarily Q. ellipsoidales and Q. velutina)
    and stated that &quot;all of these savannas are related to brush prairie rather than true
    prairie&quot;. &nbsp; Brush prairie, &quot;in which grasses hid the oaks&quot; was
    equivalent to Bray's (1955) scrub savanna and Grimm's (1981) oak-scrub, but was classified
    as prairie &quot;which was devoid of all true tree species&quot; for the purposes of
    Curtis's map. &nbsp; Brush prairie, with <i>Q. macrocarpa, Q. velutina, </i>and 
    <i>Q. ellipsoidalis</i> dominant, occurred on hillsides, glacial moraines, and other areas of
    uneven ground.</p>
    <p>Both the Wisconsin State Scientific
    Areas Council and the Wisconsin Chapter of the Nature Conservancy use Curtis's definition
    of oak opening as the basis for their determinations of current examples of oak savanna,
    specifically: stands of open-grown oaks with densities ranging from one tree per acre up
    to a maximum of 50 percent canopy cover, with a predominantly herbaceous groundlayer of
    native forbs and grasses.</p>
    <p>Curtis recognized four types of oak
    savanna in Wisconsin. Bur oak opening, dominated by <i>Q. macrocarpa</i>, was the most
    extensive and occurred primarily on level ground.&nbsp; White oak-black oak savanna
    (dominated by Q. alba and/or <i>Q. velutina</i>) occurred on more hilly sites.
    Swamp white oak savanna (dominated by Q. bicolor) was located on wet-mesic and wet
    sites, and oak barrens or scrub oak savanna (dominated by <i>Q. ellipsoidalis</i> and
    occasionally by <i>Q. velutina</i>) was confined primarily to the sandy soils of central
    and northwestern Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>Finley's (1976) larger and more
    detailed presettlement vegetation map separately located oak openings, scrub oak and jack
    pine barrens, and upland brush. &nbsp; Finley used a definition of oak savanna similar to
    Curtis's-&quot;trees growing as individuals or in loose clumps within the open
    grasslands&quot; but mapped oak openings only &quot;where clearly designated by the
    surveyors as such.&nbsp; Thus, much of the area mapped as oak forest may well have really
    been oak openings.&quot;&nbsp; Oak barrens were defined as &quot;thin stands of scrubby
    dwarf oaks on sandy soils&quot;, again similar to Curtis's definition. &quot;Upland
    brush&quot; was defined as &quot;small growth, not underbrush&quot; which developed after
    a forested area was destroyed, generally by fire.</p>
    <p>At least eleven counties in Wisconsin
    have been individually mapped, in whole or in part, for presettlement vegetation using the
    GLO records as primary data sources (Auclair 1976, Barnes 1974, Dorney 1981, Ellarson
    1949, Goder 1956, Gould 1941, Liegel 1982, Nee 1969, Neuenschwander 1956, Schwarzmeier and
    Johnson 1975, Stroessner and Habeck 1966, Tans 1976, Whitford and Salamun 1954, Zicker
    1955).&nbsp; These maps frequently show considerable differences from those by Curtis and
    Finley, due in part to the larger scale of the maps, and in part to individual
    interpretations of the survey records and definitions of the plant communities.</p>
    <p>In 1985 the Wisconsin Scientific Areas
    Council (within the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources) had identified seventeen
    oak openings and twelve oak barrens of state, county, or local significance.&nbsp; Eight
    of the oak openings, totaling 57.4 hectares, were considered to be of state
    significance.&nbsp; An additional four savannas, totaling approximately 34 hectares, were
    ranked as having county significance. &nbsp; None of the sites occur on deep soil,
    although the Careyville savanna is located on alluvial deposits.&nbsp; The remaining
    stands are located on sand, glacial deposits, or similarly droughty locations.&nbsp; </p>
            <h4><i>Ohio</i></h4>
    <p>Gordon (1966) mapped the &quot;Natural
    Vegetation of Ohio at the Time of the Earliest Land Surveys&quot; using GLO notes, and
    located oak savanna in two areas in the northern part of the state.&nbsp; In an
    accompanying publication, Gordon (1969) described oak savannas based on Sears' (1926)
    definition of oak openings: &quot;The oak forming thin groves, or being present as
    scattered clumps of individuals, with the (generally lower) ground between occupied by
    grasses and other herbaceous vegetation&quot;.</p>
    <p>Anderson (1982), in a comprehensive
    overview of Ohio vegetation, defined oak savanna as a community in which oaks and
    occasionally other tree species &quot;comprise a prominent yet partial overstory&quot;
    with canopy levels of 10 to 100 percent &quot;above a prairie understory&quot;.&nbsp;
    Anderson distinguished two major types of oak savanna.&nbsp; Bur oak savanna was
    especially characterized by <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> on mesic to wet soils of Wisconsin
    till plain of west-central Ohio. &nbsp; Gordon (1966) mapped the region as prairie, but
    indicated that scattered 'savanna groves' occurred through the area (Gordon 1969).
    Anderson believed that much of the prairie surrounding the savannas was analogous to the
    &quot;brush prairie&quot; in Wisconsin described by Curtis (1959).&nbsp; White oak-black
    oak savanna occurred on gravel deposits in the same area, and also on sandy soil in the
    &quot;Oak Openings&quot; region on the Lake Plains of northwestern Ohio.&nbsp; For
    functional purposes, Anderson's concept of savanna in the Oak Openings region differed
    from Gordon's: Gordon (1969) considered the entire region, composed of alternating patches
    of prairie, forest and wetland, to collectively comprise oak openings, whereas Anderson
    considered savanna to occur only in those areas where oaks intermingled with prairie
    vegetation.&nbsp; Anderson referred to Beatley (1959) to suggest that a third type of
    savanna may have occurred on lacustrine deposits in Jackson County.</p>
    <p>Estimates of the extent of oak savanna
    in Ohio at the time of settlement ranged from 45,000 hectares (Gordon 1966) to less than
    259,000 hectares (Anderson 1984, pers.&nbsp;comm).</p>
    <p>Gordon (1966) mentioned that
    &quot;barrens&quot; were similar to oak savannas but were frequently burned, and composed
    of short hazel brush, oak sprouts, grasses and forbs.&nbsp; Sears (1926) defined barrens
    as &quot;an habitat in which tree growth is scrubby, defective, or even absent; used alike
    in cases of deficient and excessive soil moisture.&quot;&nbsp; Sears also stated that
    prairies were &quot;generally grassy, but sometimes covered with low shrubs or
    brush.&quot;&nbsp; Barrens may have been a form of oak opening: Anderson (1982) stated
    that on some sites, particularly dry areas, &quot;good distinctions between oak openings
    and barrens could not always be made&quot;.</p>
    <p>The Division of Natural Areas and
    Preserves in the Ohio Department of Natural Resources accepts the definition and
    classification of oak savanna developed by Anderson.</p>
    <p>Three small oak savannas were
    identified in Ohio in 1985. &nbsp;Number 1 is a 5.6 hectare bur oak
    savanna.&nbsp;&nbsp;This privately owned tract has been variously termed an oak savanna, a
    prairie, and a prairie with scattered oaks. &nbsp; Long-term grazing has reduced the
    diversity of this site, which is believed to be the only example of a mesic or bur oak
    savanna in the state with a partially native ground layer. Small tracts of black oak
    savanna occur in the Oak Openings region.&nbsp; Number 2 indicates two sites, each of less
    than one-half hectare, which have fairly undisturbed ground layers.&nbsp; One of these
    sites is protected within the 36-hectare Schwamberger Prairie, an area of alternating
    swell and swale ridges, managed by the Ohio Chapter of The Nature Conservancy.</p>
            <h4><i>Indiana</i></h4>
    <p>State-wide presettlement vegetation
    maps based on GLO records have been developed for Indiana by Lindsey et al.&nbsp;(1965)
    and Potzger et al.&nbsp;(1956). &nbsp; Lindsey did not include oak savanna; Potzger mapped
    the community without defining it.</p>
    <p>The map of presettlement oak savanna
    in Indiana was adapted from Bacone and Campbell (1980), Bacone et al. (1980), Rohr and
    Potzger (1950), Finley and Potzger (1952), and Potzger et al. (1956), all based on GLO
    data.</p>
    <p>Four oak savanna types were identified
    by Bacone and Campbell (1980) and Bacone et al.&nbsp;(1980). Black oak savanna (dominated
    by <i>Q. velutina</i>) was located on sandy soil primarily in northwest Indiana, in
    association with dry sand prairie species.&nbsp; The community type also occurred in
    northeast Indiana (Bacone 1985, pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp; This community was often referred
    to as &quot;barrens&quot; by the early surveyors. </p>
    <p>White oak-black oak savanna occurred
    on more mesic soils. Bur oak savanna occurred exclusively on silt loam soils and was most
    highly developed in Lake County (Bacone and Campbell, 1980).&nbsp; A hypothesized bur
    oak-black oak savanna varient was confined to silt loam soils of the Valparaiso moraine,
    and a hypothesized white oak-bur oak savanna varient was located on the same soils but
    farther south. &nbsp; Oak-hickory savanna (<i>Q. alba-Q. velutina-Q. rubra-Carya sp.</i>)
    occurred on sandy and silty soils &quot;on the south edge of the Valparaiso moraine&quot;
    in Lake County, and south of the Dunes Complex along Lake Michigan in Porter and LaPorte
    Counties.</p>
    <p>The term &quot;barrens&quot; was used
    by land surveyors throughout the state.&nbsp; In northern Indiana it was interpreted to
    mean oak savanna (Bacone and Campbell 1980).&nbsp; In southern Indiana &quot;barrens&quot;
    has been considered to indicate extensive prairie communities within the deciduous forest
    region (Braun 1950); communities dominated by <i>Q. alba, Q. velutina, </i>and
    <i>Carya</i>
    species with prairie grasses, confined to areas of sinkhole topography (Keith 1983); and
    &quot;extensive treeless and semi-treeless areas&quot; in southern Indiana south of the
    glacial till plain (Hutchison 1982).&nbsp; These areas have not been included in the map
    of Indiana oak savanna.</p>
    <p>A very rough estimate of the
    pre-settlement coverage of oak savanna is 514,000 hectares, derived from Potzger et
    al.&nbsp;(1956) by Homoya (1984 pers.&nbsp;comm.).&nbsp; Betz (1978) stated that 7.5
    percent of Indiana, or 647,500 hectares, was a combination of &quot;sand prairie and black
    oak savanna&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Division of Nature Preserves in
    the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Indiana Natural Heritage Program, and the
    Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore accept the definitions of oak savanna developed by
    Bacone, Campbell and Wilhelm (1980).</p>
    <p>Fifteen savannas totaling 617 hectares
    have been identified in Indiana following inventory efforts of the Division of Nature
    Preserves and the Indiana Natural Heritage Program.&nbsp; All are sand savannas, dominated
    primarily by black oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>) and classified as dry, dry-mesic or
    mesic.&nbsp; No deep-soil savannas have been identified in the state.</p>
            <h4><i>Michigan</i></h4>
    <p>The only state-wide pre-settlement
    vegetation map developed for Michigan correlated presettlement forest types, soil types,
    and historical data (Veatch 1959).&nbsp; Veatch classified dry prairie, marsh (including
    wet prairie) and oak opening as a single vegetation type.</p>
    <p>Nine counties in southwestern Michigan
    were mapped by Kenoyer (1928, 1933, 1939) from data in the GLO records.&nbsp; The accuracy
    of these maps is affected by Kenoyer's assumption that the frequency of witness trees
    cited in the records was proportional to the actual frequency of these trees at the time
    of settlement.&nbsp; Four vegetation types were indicated on each map, one of which
    included both prairie and 'scattered oaks'.</p>
    <p>A detailed map of the presettlement
    vegetation of Kalamazoo County was developed by Hodler et al.(1981) based on GLO
    notes.&nbsp; Fifteen vegetation types were defined, including bur oak openings (<i>Quercus
    macrocarpa</i>) and oak savanna (<i>Quercus alba</i>), each with one to fifteen trees per
    acre.&nbsp; Areas with oak densities greater than fifteen trees per acre were mapped as
    oak forest.</p>
    <p>Chapman (1984, pers.&nbsp;comm.)
    mapped the presettlement extent of oak savanna in Michigan based on Hodler et
    al.&nbsp;(1981, Kalamazoo County) and Brewer et al.&nbsp;(1984, Allegan, Berrien, Berry,
    Branch, Calhoun, Cass, Eaton, Kalamazoo, St.&nbsp;Joseph, Van Buren Counties) and
    hypothesized the extent of savanna in the remainder of the state on the basis of
    &quot;glacial deposits--outwash plains and coarse-textured glacial moraines and till plus
    sandy glacial lakebeds, as detailed in a quaternary geology map (Farrand and Bell, 1982),
    correlated with historical data and literature&quot;.</p>
    <p>The Michigan Natural Features
    Inventory (Chapman 1985) recognizes four types of oak savanna: oak openings dominated by 
    <i>Quercus
    alba</i> occurred on rolling topography on well-drained outwash plains in the eastern and
    southwestern parts of the state; bur oak plains, dominated by <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>
    occurred on level sites on loam and silt loam soils, usually in the southwestern part of
    the state; lakeplain oak openings, a savanna-wet prairie complex characterized by 
    <i>Quercus
    palustris, Quercus velutina</i> and <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> occurred on sandy
    ridges of former glacial lake beds in the eastern part of the state near Lake Huron; and
    oak barrens, dominated by <i>Quercus velutina</i>, developed on level to rolling
    topography on sandy outwash plains or old sandy lakebeds.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Chapman (1984
    pers.&nbsp;comm.)&nbsp;estimated that approximately 194,000 hectares of oak savanna were
    present at the time of settlement.&nbsp; Bur oak plains accounted for 10 to 15 percent of
    this area, lakeplain oak openings covered some 44,000 hectares and the remainder was
    primarily oak openings.&nbsp; Oak barrens covered an additional 73,000 hectares.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>No high quality savannas have been
    located in Michigan during field studies conducted by the Michigan Natural Features
    Inventory through September 1985. &nbsp; The Inventory identified 15 savanna remnants
    ranging in quality from grade AB to D.</p>
    <p>Black Road Savanna represents the best
    example of lakeplain oak openings located in the state.&nbsp; Highland Park is the highest
    quality example of oak openings in Michigan, while Allegan and Indian Mound are considered
    to be the finest remaining examples of oak barrens within Michigan.&nbsp; Allegan Oak
    Barrens is a former pine-oak savanna owned by the Michigan Department of Natural
    Resources, Wildlife Division, and burned once by the agency in 1978 to encourage the
    development of a black oak savanna or barrens.</p>
    <p>The other savanna sites have been
    degraded to a greater degree. &nbsp; Lawton is a dry savanna or oak barrens, which occurs
    in a strip approximately 800 meters long by twenty-five meters wide along a railroad
    track.&nbsp; Marlborough and Norway were formerly part of the pine-oak savanna, and are
    now considered to be oak barrens. &nbsp; Dickinson Island has been grazed and mowed, while
    Sebewaing has a dense understory of woody shrubs and saplings.&nbsp; </p>
            <h4><i>Missouri</i></h4>
    <p>Maps of presettlement vegetation of
    Missouri by Steyermark (1969) and Kucera (1961) indicated the extent of forest and prairie
    communities, but did not include oak savanna.&nbsp; Schroeder (1981) frequently mentioned
    barrens, savannas, and glades but chose to exclude them from his map &quot;Presettlement
    Prairies of Missouri&quot;. &nbsp; However, he commented that &quot;According to the
    surveyor's notes much of the Ozarks could have been called Brush Prairie&quot;.&nbsp;
    Interpreting GLO notes to determine presettlement character of the state is difficult, as
    parts of Missouri were settled up to 100 years prior to land survey: in these regions the
    GLO notes may indicate the influence of settlement on the landscape, rather than the
    presettlement condition (Chaplain 1984, pers.&nbsp;comm.). </p>
    <p>Thom and Wilson (1983) indicated that
    extensive savanna occurred in the Springfield Plateau Section of the Ozark Natural
    Division and in the Osage Plains Natural Division of Missouri. Howell and Kucera (1956)
    mapped the occurrence of prairie, forest, and barrens in three counties from GLO
    notes.&nbsp; They interpreted barrens as widely-spaced trees with forb and grass
    cover.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The map of presettlement oak savanna
    of Missouri, derived from Iffrig and Nelson (1983), indicates the potential range of
    savanna at the time of settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson (1985) estimated that savanna covered
    approximately one third of the state or some 5,261,000 hectares. </p>
    <p>Nelson (1985) defined savanna as
    having 10 to 50 percent canopy cover, little or no shrub layer, and a ground layer
    dominated by prairie grasses and herbs. He classified nine types of savanna by soil
    moisture and substrate.&nbsp; Each savanna type includes one or more oaks as dominant
    species, but is not necessarily an oak savanna. The understory is typically open, except
    in igneous savanna. The ground layer is generally dominated by herbaceous species of the
    corresponding prairie community, although sandstone savanna, sand savanna and igneous
    savanna ground layers are characterized by non-specific grasses, herbs, mosses and/or
    lichens. All of Missouri was potential habitat for one or more of the nine savanna
    communities.&nbsp; The nine savanna types are dry savanna, dry-mesic savanna, mesic
    savanna, wet-mesic savanna, limestone/dolomite savanna, chert savanna, sandstone savanna,
    sand savanna, and igneous savanna.</p>
    <p>Nelson's savanna types are recognized
    by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the Missouri Department of
    Conservation.</p>
    <p>No intact example of a deep soil
    savanna had been identified in the state by 1985.&nbsp; Four remnant high- to mid-quality
    oak savannas located on droughty substrates have been identified by the Missouri
    Department of Natural Resources. </p>
            <h4><i>Illinois</i></h4>
    <p>Presettlement vegetation maps for
    Illinois have not distinguished savanna as a vegetation type (Anderson 1970, Fehrenbacher
    and Alexander 1958, Vestal 1931).&nbsp; Anderson (1970) included barrens, which were
    established on forest soils and lacked characteristic prairie species such as Silphium
    species, as part of the prairie community.&nbsp; Fehrenbacher and Alexander (1958) mapped
    three vegetation types in relation to soil associations.&nbsp; In addition to prairie and
    forest, mixed forest and prairie occurred primarily on terraces and bottomlands along many
    of the major streams and in narrow bands between true prairie and true forest
    soils.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vestal (1931) mapped &quot;prairie expanses, post oak forests, and other
    areas chiefly forest&quot; and mentioned the presence of black oak on sand ridges and
    dunes near Chicago, blackjack oak (<i>Quercus marilandica</i>) forest alternating with
    sand prairie in western Illinois, and prairie &quot;with open oak forest and scattered
    individual trees&quot; in northwestern Illinois.</p>
    <p>Presettlement savanna has been mapped
    for Lake County (Moran 1978), DeKalb, Kane and DuPage Counties (Moran 1980), eastern Cook
    County (Hanson 1981), Kane County (Kilburn 1959: &quot;bur oak type forest&quot;),
    Williamson County (Anderson and Anderson, 1975) and northwestern Illinois (Pepoon 1911).</p>
    <p>The map of presettlement oak savanna
    in Illinois was based on the potential for the community to occur on soils associated with
    savanna vegetation, in particular mollic halpludalfs and udollic ochraqualfs.&nbsp; Lake,
    Kane and Cook Counties were drawn from the maps developed by Moran (1978), Kilburn (1959)
    and Hanson (1981) respectively.&nbsp; The remainder of the map should not be considered an
    accurate depiction of presettlement savanna distribution in the state.</p>
    <p>Oak savanna is defined by the Illinois
    Natural History Survey (White and Madany 1978) as a community with a grassy groundcover
    and an average tree canopy cover of less than 80 percent but greater than 10
    percent.&nbsp; Within a savanna, shrubby areas may occur, and the tree canopy may locally
    be greater than 80 percent or less than 10 percent. Three savanna subclasses are
    recognized in Illinois: dry-mesic and mesic savanna on fine-textured soil on till plains
    and lowlands; dry and dry-mesic sand savanna on very sandy soils containing little humus;
    dry, dry-mesic and mesic barren, &quot;local inclusions of prairie flora, mixed with forest, in
    forested land mainly in southern and western Illinois and along major rivers&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>As in other states, the term
    &quot;barren&quot; in Illinois is considered ambiguous (White and Madany 1978) because it
    has been applied to several different types of vegetation, including &quot;treeless areas,
    shrubby areas, and forested areas with grassy groundcovers&quot;.&nbsp; Hutchison (1982)
    proposed a six-part definition for the community.&nbsp; Anderson and Schwegman (1971)
    stated that barrens are &quot;prairie-forest transitions&quot; that &quot;occurred south
    of the Illinoisan glacial limit and beyond the major area of prairies&quot;.&nbsp; As with
    savanna, the community is so little known that no complete definition has yet been
    developed.</p>
    <p>No estimate of the presettlement
    extent of oak savanna has been developed for Illinois.</p>
    <p>Thirty-five high- to mid-quality
    (grade A, B or C) oak savannas and barrens were located in Illinois as of January 1985 by
    the Illinois Natural Heritage Survey.&nbsp; Despite the large number of individual
    savannas, only a few are of high quality grade A condition.&nbsp; No sizable example of an
    intact deep-soil mesic savanna was located within the state, and only one high-quality
    dry-mesic savanna covering 0.1 hectare was identified (Number 15).&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority
    of high quality savannas remaining in the state are sand savannas, with six sites
    (totaling 69.3 hectares) of grade A dry and dry-mesic sand savanna. Most of the savannas
    are small isolated tracts of less than ten hectares, with eleven stands each covering less
    than one hectare.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4><i>Iowa</i></h4>
    <p>In a presettlement vegetation map for
    the state, Weller (1969) located oak savanna, but provided no definition for the
    community, nor any indication of how the map was made.&nbsp; It is presented as a general
    indication of where oak savanna may have occurred in the state.</p>
    <p>Literature references to oak savanna
    in Iowa are rare, and no ecological studies have been published.&nbsp; The majority of
    papers refer to the vegetation of presettlement Iowa as consisting of either forest or
    prairie, although in a few papers brief references are made to what may be oak
    savanna.&nbsp; Dick-Peddie (1953) remarked that &quot;a wide ecotone, often referred to in
    the GLO notes as oak barrens, was found in some areas...these areas of oak barrens could
    be recognized [by the author] when a witness tree was recorded from an area which the
    surveyor had called prairie&quot;. &nbsp; Clark (1926) described a bur oak-black oak
    woodland with open spaces &quot;in which prairie species are found&quot;.&nbsp; Shimek
    (1948) stated that &quot;a scant sprinkling of trees, usually stunted hard-wood species
    such as oaks, etc., encroaches upon the prairie border producing the typical
    'oak-openings' or 'oak barrens'.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Iowa Natural Areas Inventory
    determined that three types of oak savanna occurred in Iowa near the time of settlement
    (Schennum 1984, pers.&nbsp;comm.). &nbsp; Loess hills savanna, dominated by 
    <i>Quercus
    macrocarpa, Andropogon scoparius,</i> and <i>Bouteloua curtipendula,</i> was restricted to
    the loess hills landform of the Missouri River valley in western Iowa.&nbsp; Sand savanna
    was dominated by a variety of oaks and sand prairie species, and occurred in a few river
    valleys and the Lake Calvin Basin landform region (Prior 1976) in eastern Iowa.&nbsp; Tallgrass savanna, found throughout most of the state in association with tallgrass
    prairie, was dominated by <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> and a variety of prairie grasses, with
    specific herbaceous composition dependent upon soil moisture.</p>
    <p>No estimate is available for the
    presettlement extent of oak savanna in Iowa.</p>
    <p>The Iowa Natural Areas Inventory
    (Schennum 1984, pers.&nbsp;comm.) has located three oak savanna remnants.&nbsp; Site 1 (4
    hectares), dominated by white oak on loessal sand, is in a private cemetery which is mowed
    three times a year, with a resultant decline in species diversity.&nbsp; Site 2 (2.5
    hectares) is a privately owned and non-managed sand prairie-savanna complex, with black
    oak and hill's oak dominant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Site 3 (14.2 hectares), the only extensive
    tallgrass savanna remnant located in Iowa, is a prairie opening with scattered bur oaks on
    silty clay loam, owned by the Clay County Conservation Board and assigned a quality rank
    of &quot;A&quot; (on a scale of A=highest to D=lowest quality). </p>
    <p>As the Iowa Natural Areas Inventory
    continues, additional sites are expected to be found, particularly in the Little Sioux
    River drainage system of northwest Iowa and in the Loess Hills.&nbsp; In this latter area
    some of the savannas may represent the recent invasion of young bur oaks into prairies
    (Schennum 1984, pers. comm.).</p>
