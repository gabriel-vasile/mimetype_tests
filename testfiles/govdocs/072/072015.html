regional savanna burning and the seasonality of the atmospheric circulation must be considered simultaneously. Here we describe the temporal and spatial distribution of savanna fires over the entire African continent, as determined from night-time satellite imagery. We find that, contrary to expectations, most fires are left to burn uncontrolled, so that there is no strong diurnal cycle in the fire frequency. The knowledge gained from this study regarding the distribution and variability of fires will aid monitoring of the climatically important trace gases emitted from burning <a href="glossary.html#biomass">biomass</a>.<p>

The night-time low-light satellite imagery used here was acquired by 
	the <a href="glossary.html#dmsp">Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)</a> Block 5 satellites 
	during 1986 and 1987. The satellites provide imagery primarily for use 
	in weather forecasting, in snow and ice boundary observation, and in 
	<a href="glossary.html#clouds">cloud</a> studies<sup>7,8</sup>. But night-time imaging of the Earth also records 
	man-made and natural lighting such as cities, fires, lightning and 
	auroras8. We used local midnight imagery to observe light sources on 
	the Earth's surface in the region of Africa shown in Fig. 1. The 
	upwelling terrestrial light is measured in the 0.4-1.1 micro-m range at a 
	resolution of 2.7 km. One problem with the use of DMSP imagery is that 
	variations in intensity cannot be quantitatively interpreted, as the 
	images are archived in photographic form, rather than in digital form, 
	and calibration after processing is impossible. Even so, because of 
	the high contrast between the background and the light sources, the 
	light sources can easily be distinguished qualitatively and mapped. 
	Cities are isolated and removed, as their location does not vary from 
	month to month, leaving only the time-varying light sources. 
	Throughout the study years, visible imagery was obtained for every 
	fourth day on average. Although these images are not spread out 
	evenly, the temporal distribution through most months is good. We 
	produced mosaic images showing light from the time-varying sources 
	averaged over each month. We also examined the daily spatial 
	distribution of fires for<p>

each month to check that each mosaic is representative of the actual burning throughout the month.<p>
	Analysis of monthly DMSP imagery during 1986 and 1987 indicates that January is the peak season for African savanna burning north of the Equator. The January precipitation analysis shows nearly all of the savannas north of the Equator receiving less than 25 mm of precipitation. The Northern Hemisphere savannas burn extensively during this time of year and have been widely studied on the regional scale<sup>9-11</sup>. In the January DMSP composite images (Fig. 2a), a wide band of fires can be seen stretching across the savannas south of the Sahara desert. The 'speckled' light sources represent the locations of active fires sweeping across the continent. The northern edge of this active fire band has been reported previously<sup>8</sup>. The majority of these fires are initiated by human activities.<sup>5,6</sup><p>
During the first half of the year, the dry season shifts from the 
	Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. In February and 
	March, precipitation increases gradually from south to north across 
	the Northern Hemisphere African savannas, and there is a noticeable 
	drop in the frequency of fire activity. By April, few lights exist 
	across the entire African continent except in populated and industrial 
	areas, and savanna burning in both hemispheres is at a minimum. From 
	March to June, drier conditions spread over the Southern Hemisphere 
	savannas from Namibia eastward towards the interior of southern 
	Africa, and fire activity increases rapidly over the interior 
	southern Africa savannas. By May, burning activity is widespread in 
	Angola, Zambia, southern Zaire and Zimbabwe. In June, burning is at a 
	peak in southern Zaire (Fig. 2b and c) with a sinusoidal pattern 
	defining the northern edge of the fires. This pattern follows the 
	<a href="glossary.html#ecosystem">ecosystem</a> boundary between subhumid forest and the equatorial topical 
	<a href="glossary.html#rain_forest">rainforest</a> in north and central Zaire, and also appeared in 1979 DMSP 
	imagery. Some fire activity is also apparent in eastern Africa in the 
	nation of Tanzania, but little activity is identifiable in Mozambique 
	to the south.<p>
	From July to October, savanna burning increases in the eastern 
	countries and wanes in some western and interior nations south of the 
	Equator. During July and August, the fire activity slowly drops off in 
	Zaire due to increasing precipitation, there is little change in fire 
	activity over Angola, and fires increase in Tanzania. Through the 
	months of August and September, drier conditions extend to the eastern 
	coast of southern Africa, and fire activity increases in Tanzania and 
	Mozambique (Fig. 2d). In 1987 burning activity in Angola dropped off 
	substantially by September, but in 1986 it required a few more weeks 
	because precipitation increased more slowly in that region. In October,
	 the greatest fire activity across the southern African savannas 
	 occurs in the southeastern nations. During October, moist conditions 
	 return to most of the interior nations south of the Equator,

and dry conditions remain along a path from the coast of Namibia to Lake 
Malawi in the east. Fire activity seems most widespread in Tanzania, and i
s decreasing in neighbouring countries. This observation is consistent with 
results from the 1984 measurement of <a href="glossary.html#air_poll">air pollution</a> from satellites (MAPS) 
shuttle experiment which flew in early October and measured the highest middle 
tropospheric carbon monoxide concentrations over the southeast African 
nations<sup>12</sup>. Photographs taken during the 1984 MAPS shuttle flight also showed 
many active fires burning in Mozambique<sup>3,12</sup>.<p>
	Satellite coverage was scarce or unavailable for the remaining months
	 in the year, so that the demise of the Southern Hemisphere African 
	 savanna burning cycle and onset of the Northern Hemisphere African 
	 savanna burning cycle could not be analysed. November 1986 imagery 
	 was available (but limited) and showed no fire activity in the west 
	 and central nations in the southern African continent. From the 
	 actual and mean precipitation patterns and the previous observations, 
	 it is expected that fire activity south of the Equator will continue 
	 along the east coast nations into November but will cease by December. At the same time, fire activity will return to the interior African savannas north of the Equator first, and spread to the far west later in December. Hence, the annual burning cycle of the African savannas continues.<p>
	All of the monthly composites for each year were combined (Fig. 3) to 
	illustrate the extremity of savanna burning in Africa. From the annual 
	mosaics it is immediately obvious that a large percentage of African 
	savanna is affected annually by fire and that the overall patterns are 
	the same. The regions that show the highest fire frequency are southern 
	Zaire, Angola, northern Mozambique, southern Tanzania, eastern Central 
	African Republic and southwestern Sudan. In areas such as southern 
	Zaire (in June) where the fire frequency is extremely high, the burned 
	areas are more likely to be homogeneous in coverage. The spatial 
	distribution of Northern Hemisphere African fires is consistent with 
	the work of Goldammer<sup>13</sup> (based on the spatial extent of the northern 
	savannas). From our multiyear study (including some 1979 DMSP imagery), 
	the examination of the mean<sup>14</sup> and actual precipitation patterns, the 
	knowledge that the burning is the result of enhancing agricultural 
	productivity and is tied to a seasonal cycle, and the consistency with 
	the MAPS mission data and photography, it seems that the overall tire 
	distribution does not vary much from year to year. This can probably 
	be attributed to the distribution of the human population, which, in 
	an agricultural society, is not likely to shift rapidly on a year-to-
	year basis. Any interannual variability is most probably attributable 
	to variations in the precipitation patterns.<p>
	Two other observations are made from the DMSP imagery. There is a 
	great deal of fire activity well into the night, and the night-time 
	frequency and distribution of fires resemble those mapped during the 
	daytime in some regional studies. Once the fires are started, in most 
	cases they are left to burn uncontrolled, and as the satellite imagery 
	shows, fire frequency may not be as strongly diurnal as is commonly 
	believed. The DMSP imagery occasionally shows random fires in the 
	rainy areas. Although random burning may take place throughout the <p>

year, the fires are most frequent during the dry period when the herbaceous material has completely withered.<p>
	It is readily apparent that to study African savanna burning 
	thoroughly, an extensive portion of the African continent must 
	be examined and, for <a href="glossary.html#remote_sens">remote sensing</a> investigations, a substantial 
	volume of imagery must be acquired. Because of the extent of the 
	savannas and the difficulty of working with such a volume of satellite 
	imagery, the continental distribution of African burning has remained 
	largely unstudied. Previous remote sensing investigations of African 
	savanna fires have been regional in scope, not recognizing the 
	shifting distribution of the fires such as the eastward progression 
	of fire activity across the Southern Hemisphere savannas, or 
	establishing its relations'hip with atmospheric circulation. Emission 
	estimates from savanna burning have been based largely on statistical 
	reports, which contain a great deal of uncertainty. Knowledge of the 
	temporal and spatial variability of the African savanna fires, as 
	shown here, can greatly reduce the extent of satellite coverage 
	required to determine and monitor the total area burned throughout 
	the year. The reduction in required satellite coverage makes it 
	feasible to monitor and estimate the extent of the burned savanna, 
	and, from the area estimates, the atmospheric trace gas emissions 
	can be derived.<p>
	The transport of African savanna fire emissions depends on time, 
	geographical location, altitude and winds. Given the expected 
	geographical location of the fires in the Southern Hemisphere, 
	fire emissions are more likely to be transported towards the 
	mid-Atlantic Ocean. Emissions from savanna fires that burn in 
	September and October around Tanzania are more likely to be 
	transported westward towards the Atlantic Ocean rather than 
	the Indian Ocean. Emissions from Northern Hemisphere fires are 
	almost always transported to the west, but cross-hemispheric 
	transport largely depends on the time of year. The wind flow also 
	varies with altitude, and emissions at higher altitudes are more 
	likely to be transported to the west by the trade winds. Atmospheric 
	instability is a primary mechanism for carrying savanna fire emissions 
	to higher altitudes, but under some atmospheric conditions, large and 
	intense fires can inject the emissions to higher altitudes as well. 
	Knowledge of the savanna fire location relative to the wind flow and 
	zones of instability is extremely important in evaluating savanna fire 
	emission export off the African continent.<p>
	Savanna burning predates the presence of humans in Africa, the 
	result of lightning-initiated fires, but human population pressures 
	have greatly increased its extent and frequency<sup>13</sup>. With
the increase in fires comes the increased environmental and climatic impact 
of trace gas cycling and photochemistry, <a href="glossary.html#green_gas">greenhouse gas</a> production, <a href="glossary.html#acid_rain">acid 
rain </a>deposition, and the influence of fire-produced <a href="glossary.html#aerosol">aerosols </a>on tropical 
cloud behaviour. Only through the combined knowledge of the distribution 
of African savanna fires, fire emission estimates and atmospheric circulation 
can we further our understanding of how the fire emissions affect both the 
<a href="glossary.html#biosphere">biosphere</a> and the <a href="glossary.html#atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. As a step towards that understanding, this 
study demonstrates the spatial and temporal (seasonal and daily) shifts in 
African savanna burning and should help satellite coverage to be tailored to 
maximize its efficiency for estimating burned savanna.          <p>
