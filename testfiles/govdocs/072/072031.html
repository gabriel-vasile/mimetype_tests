	<b>Communication Plan</b>: Results of projects will be communicated via peer reviewed publications.<br><b>Objectives</b>: (1) Describe the relationships among fire history, current woody vegetation structure, and animal and plant populations (amphibian, bird, bees, butterfly, herbaceous vegetation, and reptile populations) in historic oak savannas.  
(2) Assess the effects of fire seasonality on herbaceous vegetation communities in oak savannas.  
(3) Describe the relationships between habitat, land-use history and disturbance on the distribution and abundance on non-native plants in National Parks.<br><b>Statement of Problem</b>: Oak savannas were the dominant terrestrial ecosystem in the upper Midwest at the time of European settlement of the region.  Today less than one percent of historic savanna acreage remains intact.  Although very little of the savanna landscape remains as savanna, a small percent of this historic landscape is available for restoration.  A major impediment to restoration is that oak savanna is scientifically ill defined.  This lack of clarity arises because oak savanna has ecotonal characteristics.  Little is known about what species are truly depend on the savanna and how these resident species might respond to the main management tool for savanna restoration - fire.  Further complicating the restoration issue is non-native invasives.  

A number of questions related to characterization of Midwest oak savannas therefore remain unanswered and often unexplored.  Fundamental among these questions is whether there is a unique biota, separate from forest and grassland flora and fauna, that reaches peak abundance in oak savannas or is dependent upon savannas for survival.  In the absence of answers to this question, savanna restoration goals will remain poorly delineated and the conservation priority for restoring savannas will be unclear.

Towards the goals of better understanding the dependency of Midwest animal and plant populations on oak savannas and to better understanding how fire can be used to restore savannas, studies are being conducted under the Ecology of Public Lands/Terrestrial Systems, Indiana task project.  First, are studies examining twenty-five historical oak savanna sites in Northwest Indiana.  The fire history and current woody vegetation structure of these sites is under investigation to determine the affects of fire on the animal and plant species residing there.  The sites represent a spectrum of anthropogenic changes the savannas have undergone, ranging from farming, sand mining, and fire suppression to very frequent fire.  A study of amphibians, reptiles, birds, bees, butterflies, and herbaceous vegetation responses to past management practices is under way.  Second, is an experimental examination of the effects of fire seasonality on woody and herbaceous vegetation in savannas.  Fire suppression has significantly changed many savanna remnants.  The return of prescribed burning has helped to restore some of these remnants.  Nonetheless, prescribed burns usually occurs in a very stereotypical manner during the dormant season, which does not necessarily mimic historic patterns of lightning induced fires during the growing season.  Examining the response of herbaceous vegetation to prescribed fires occurring at different times during the vegetation growth cycle is critical to managing the oak savanna.  Understanding the effect of growing season versus dormant season fires on vegetation is necessary to increase the sophistication of our fire management strategies. 

The restoration of ecological terrestrial systems includes the ongoing identification and monitoring of invasive non-native plants and animals.  These invasive species can preempt habitat, reduce the abundance of native species and alter ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling.  Understanding the factors contributing to the invasion, distribution and abundance of invasive plants is a high priority for wild land management.  Comprehension of the distribution and abundance of invasive plants relative to habitat, past land use, and disturbance will aid in the restoration.  Invasive plant studies are ongoing at National Parks in the Great Lakes Region.<br><b>2003 Statement of Work</b>: Continue surveying animal and plant populations at sites involved in study of relationships of these populations to fire history and vegetation structure.  Analyze and report results of previous surveys in these studies.  Sample the vegetation in plots after experimental fires to study of the effects of fire seasonality on savanna vegetation communities.  {SpSciName:Lycaeides melissa samuelis;$8000}  {SpSciName:Cirsium pitcheri;$2000}<br><b>2004 Statement of Work</b>: As part of an ongoing study examining animal community relationships to fire history and vegetation structure, FY04 will add to previous studies of amphibians, birds, butterflies and reptiles, by examining how a major pollinator community, bees, responds to vegetation structure.  Data from the previous studies will be analyzed and prepared for publication.  Studies of the effects of dormant and growing season fire on savanna vegetation will continue.  In addition, data from previous studies concerning wild lupine establishment, fire effects on savanna/woodland vegetation and relationships between fire history, woody pland structure and understory vegetation will be analyzed and prepared for publication.<br>
