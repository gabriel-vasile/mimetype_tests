      <P>EXPRESSO was an international and multidisciplinary program,
      conducted by European, American, and African scientists, to quantify
      and better understand the processes controlling surface fluxes
      of photochemical precursors along a tropical forest to savanna
      gradient in central Africa, and to evaluate and improve understanding
      of the production and loss of tropospheric oxidants within this
      region.</P>

      <P>This experiment associated ground-based, aircraft, and remote
      sensing measurements, allowing investigation of surface fluxes
      of energy and trace gases from both savanna and forest ecosystems
      on one hand, and photochemical and dynamical processes in the
      lower atmosphere on the other hand</P>

      <P>The EXPRESSO domain extended from the savannas of the Central
      African Republic (CAR) in the north (8&deg; N) to the tropical
      forests of the Republic of Congo (2&deg; N) in the south. A research
      aircraft (the French Fokker 27-ARAT), instrumented for dynamics
      and chemistry measurements flew 11 missions out of Bangui, CAR,
      that covered a gradient from savanna to tropical forest. A 60-m
      walkup tower was installed at a nearly undisturbed tropical forest
      site. The tower provided access to the 45-m high canopy and the
      surface layer just above it. A detailed database of the extent
      of biomass burning in Central Africa during the EXPRESSO experiment
      was compiled using NOAA-AVHRR data (3 acquisitions per day).
      In addition, a detailed vegetation map was built for the EXPRESSO
      region with an evaluation of net primary production per type
      of ecosystem based on long term records of NDVI data. Finally
      a landscape VOC emission potential database was developed based
      on NOAA-AVHRR data, ground surveys of vegetation type, and a
      vegetation emission rate database</P>

      <H3><FONT COLOR="#000099">Outline of the main results</FONT></H3>

      <P>The importance of the tropics on the chemical composition
      of the global atmosphere has been recognized for more than 15
      years. The EXPRESSO field campaigns provide an original data
      set allowing to describe and better understand the atmospheric
      chemistry in the northern African tropics. It complements the
      experiments conducted since the middle of the 1980's such as
      GTE/ABLE 2A (1985) and 2B (1987) in the Amazon, DECAFE (1998,
      1991) and STARE/SAFARI (1992) in Africa. The results gained from
      EXPRESSO allow us not only to document and parameterize biogenic
      and biomass burning sources, but also to study exchange processes
      of energy and trace compounds in the region of the ITCZ. The
      main results can be summarized as follows&nbsp;:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>The energy balance of savanna and forest ecosystems is primarily
        determined by evaporation (latent heat flux) with Bowen ratios
        of the order of 0.2 and 0.45 over forest and savanna respectively.
        The kinetic energy budget in the boundary layer is dominated
        by thermal (versus dynamic) production. This can be due to very
        weak horizontal winds in the vicinity of the intertropical converge
        zone (ITCZ), in spite of the strong roughness of both ecosystems.
        The location of the experimental domain, at the interface between
        savanna and forest ecosystems and in the middle of the ITCZ,
        results in a great complexity of dynamical fields.Vertical exchanges
        between the boundary layer and the free troposphere (monsoon
        and Harmattan flows) result from a diversity of processes occurring
        at various scales. They include (i) small scale processes such
        as entrainment, penetrative dry convection, waves and wave breaking,
        boundary layer clouds, and shear wind turbulence, (ii) mesocale
        processes such as organized cloud coverage, local divergence-convergence
        fields, penetrative cloudy convection and, (iii) synoptic scale
        processes linked to subsidence and ascendance.<BR>
        <LI>A high density of fires was observed in savanna areas and,
        as a consequence, a high level of pollution was observed at regional
        scale. For instance regional concentration fields of CO and NO<SUB>y</SUB>
        in the ranges 250'400 ppb and 4'10 ppb, respectively, and high
        concentrations of benzene (0.5 ppb) and black carbon (10 <I>&micro;</I>g
        m<SUP>-3</SUP>) illustrate the overwhelming influence of biomass
        burning on the chemical composition of the lower troposphere.
        Biomass burning occurs in savanna areas where the average number
        of fires detected every day in the &quot;EXPRESSO window&quot;
        is about 5000 with corresponding burned areas of 20 000 km<SUP>2</SUP>/day.
        However aircraft data taken over the forest and ground based
        measurements taken at the forest site showed that biomass burning
        pollution widely contaminates the forest atmosphere. Biomass
        burning emissions were determined from (i) direct estimates of
        burned areas and above ground biomass density derived from remote
        sensing, and (ii) burning efficiency and emission factors. All
        these parameters present rather large uncertainties. To better
        constrain this dominant source, the redistribution of carbon
        monoxide, considered as an inert tracer of biomass burning, has
        been simulated using a 3-D non-hydrostatic mesoscale model coupled
        with an inert tracer emission module. The objective was to compare
        the CO distribution in the lower troposphere produced by the
        model with vertical profiles of CO concentration obtained from
        aircraft measurements, in order to assess the sensitivity to
        the magnitude and location of sources in redistribution of an
        inert tracer like CO and to constrain flux estimates. Estimated
        fluxes have to be divided by a factor of 2 to retrieve CO concentration
        fields consistent with aircraft observations&nbsp;; estimates
        of burned biomass in open fires is actually a difficult exercise.<BR>
        <LI>Biogenic hydrocarbon emissions were investigated on a variety
        of scales along an ecological transect extending from the dry
        woodland savanna of northern CAR to moist tropical forest in
        the Congo. Above-canopy flux measurements at the forest site
        characterized diurnal and seasonal flux variations that were
        complemented by a regional spatial integration over the forest
        and the savanna provided by flux measurements using an airborne
        REA system. Mean isoprene fluxes observed with the aircraft system
        were approximately 1200 &micro;g(C) m<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP>
        over the forest and 500 &micro;g(C) m<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP>
        over the savanna. In comparison, isoprene fluxes measured with
        the tower based REA system over the forest ranged from nearly
        zero at night to over 1000 &micro;g(C) m<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP>
        in the middle of the day. Seasonal variations in isoprene fluxes
        observed at the tower site were greater than expected. A qualitative
        emission characterization was obtained for over 200 dominant
        vegetation species along the savanna to forest gradient and quantitative
        rates of the major biogenic VOC were estimated for about 60 plant
        species. Enclosure methods were also used to determine the relationships
        between emissions and environmental conditions. These data were
        used to develop a regional emission model which is in better
        agreement with the aircraft measurements than are previous estimates
        which were based on fluxes reported for a tropical forest in
        the Amazon basin.<BR>
        <LI>Ozone and nitrogen oxide data allow study of photochemical
        characteristics of air masses in relation to ozone production
        efficiency (OPE). In the planetary boundary layer (PBL), high
        values of OPE are observed. concentrations increase with photochemical
        age of the air mass so that OPE is lower in the Harmattan layer.
        To complement the ozone budget of the PBL, ozone fluxes were
        measured from the aircraft flying at low altitude over the savanna
        and the forest. Average deposition velocities are equal to 0.7
        and 1.5 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> respectively on both ecosystems.

      <H3><FONT COLOR="#000099">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

      <P>The results gained from EXPRESSO allow us not only to document
      and parameterize biogenic and biomass burning sources, but also
      to study exchange processes of energy and trace compounds in
      the region of the ITCZ. Because of experimental constraints linked
      to the capabilities of the aircraft used, investigations were
      limited to 4 km altitude&nbsp;; however model components can
      be evaluated using the experimental results. Based on the understanding
      gained from this work, improved sub-models will be developed
      and implemented in regional and global scale chemistry and transport
      models. This modeling effort will help us better understand the
      chemistry of the upper tropical troposphere which is essential
      to assess the oxidation capacity of the global atmosphere. The
      tropical troposphere is strongly affected by cloud convection
      which favors fast vertical transfers of ozone precursors (CO,
      NMHCs, and NO<SUB>x</SUB>, produced by the continental biosphere)
      within the rising branches of the Walker cells. These compounds
      drive O<SUB>3</SUB>production in the middle and upper troposphere.
      A significant impact on the stratosphere is also expected. Finally,
      in these regions, heterogeneous phase chemistry within convective
      clouds, assumed to be important, is almost unknown. Following
      EXPRESSO, future experimental projects in the tropics will focus
      on the impact of deep convection on the chemistry of the upper
      troposphere and lower stratosphere.
