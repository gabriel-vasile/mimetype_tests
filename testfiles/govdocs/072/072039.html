<H1>NPP Grassland: Lamto, Ivory Coast, 1965-1987</H1>

<H2>Summary:</H2>

Productivity of a humid grass savanna was determined at the Lamto
Research Station, Cote Ivoire, operated in collaboration with
CNRS (Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique) - Ecole Normale
Superieure, Paris, France. Measurement of monthly dynamics of
above-ground plant matter (live biomass and dead matter for some
years, total biomass in other years), and total roots (live +
dead), were monitored from 1969 to 1987. Net primary production
has been estimated for both above and below-ground, although more
data is available on the former.

<H2><A NAME="1.">1. Data Set Overview:</A></H2>

<H3>Data Set Identification:</H3>
NPP Grassland: Lamto, Ivory Coast, 1965-1987

<H3>Introduction:</H3>
The 2500-hectare Lamto Research Station (6.22 N 5.03 W) 
is situated near the edge of the rain
forest domain, 200 km north of Abidjan near the town of Divo, 
at the southern edge of the humid savanna belt bordering the forest.
The savanna is characterized by annual burning during the dry
season in February, and by its high efficiency of nitrogen utilization.
Nitrogen is remobilized from senescing leaves, and is very rapidly
assimilated from decomposing plant residues without entering the
soil pool of mineral nitrogen. There is little potential for denitrification
(as NO2, N2 or N2O) due to the low level of soil mineral/organic
N (Abbadie <I>et al.</I>, 1992).
<P>
The grass savanna occurs within a mosaic of grass, shrub and tree
savannas distributed according to drainage, slope and micro-topology
(Menaut and Cesar, 1979; Abbadie <I>et al.</I>, 1992). <I>Loudetia
spp.</I> predominate in the grass savanna, whilst Andropogoneae
(<I>Hyperrhenia spp.</I>) provide the main grasses in the shrub
and tree savannas. Grasses make up the majority of NPP, even in
the tree savanna, where tree root turnover seems to contribute
little to NPP. Total net primary production (NPP) of the grass savanna 
has been estimated at 2150 g m-2, of which 1320 g m-2 (61%) is 
below-ground production. Normally 50-90% of above-ground grass biomass is burned annually, i.e. more than half of above ground grass production.

<H3>Objective/Purpose:</H3>
Net primary productivity was determined initially as part of a
general study of the Lamto savanna region. Lamto is part of the
SALT (Savannas in the Long-Term) transect running from Cote Ivoire
across Burkina Faso to Niger. Later data synthesis took place
with the support of CNRS, under a collaborative SCOPE Project
on modeling of grassland productivity and soil organic matter
worldwide (Parton <I>et al.</I>, 1993).

<H2><A NAME="3.">3. Theory of Measurements:</A></H2>

Net primary production (NPP), sensu stricto, is the total photosynthetic
gain (less respiratory losses) of vegetation per unit ground area.
For a given period, this is equal to the change in plant mass
plus any losses due to death and decomposition, measured for both
above ground and below ground plant parts. Earlier estimates of
grassland NPP were based on peak standing dry matter only, and
the studies of the International Biological Programme (IBP) in
the late 1960s and early 1970s were based mainly on above-ground
biomass changes, with few estimates of below-ground production.
<P>
Peak above-ground live biomass (or in some cases, the difference
between maximum and minimum biomass) has been used as an estimate
of net primary production - usually where only one or two measurements
per year are available. Sometimes a conversion factor has been
applied to take account of estimated turnover and the estimated
ratio of above-ground to below-ground dry matter.
<P>
The &quot;IBP Standard Method&quot; of Milner and Hughes (1968)
assumes that where live biomass increases between successive samples,
production equals this increase; where biomass decreases or remains
the same, production is assumed to be zero. Annual production
is then obtained by summing the estimates for each sample interval.
<P>
Essentially, this method was used for the IBP synthesis by Singh
and Joshi (1979), in particular for their estimates of below-ground
production. A modified method was used for above-ground production,
determined by a decision matrix (Singh et al., 1975); where increments
in live biomass coincided with increases in standing dead matter,
the latter were added to the monthly production.
<P>
The limitations of the above methods are discussed in detail by
Long et al. (1989). In particular, the peak biomass method and
variations on the IBP method underestimate production by not accounting
for simultaneous growth and death. This may be significant in
temperate grasslands with a long growing season, and is particularly
a problem in tropical grasslands where the growing season may
extend over much of the year. Some limited overestimation may
occur by not accounting for periods of negative NPP (due to stress,
or translocation between above and below ground plant parts) but
underestimation of root turnover is probably the largest source
of error. Long et al. (1989) estimated NPP for three terrestrial
tropical grassland sites by summing monthly changes in live biomass
plus losses due to death and decomposition for above and below
ground vegetation. Monthly losses were determined as the change
in dead matter plus the estimated disappearance of dead matter
through decomposition. Dead matter disappearance was calculated
each month as the product of relative decomposition rate and mean
amount of dead matter.
<P>
Although some correlation between estimates obtained using different
methods has been reported (Singh et al., 1975), the degree of
underestimation may be strongly site-specific (Linthurst and Reimold,
1978; Long and Mason, 1983). Where sufficient data are available
for a given grassland site, it may be possible to estimate NPP
according to the different methods for the purposes of comparison.
This may involve entry of data into algorithms or a spreadsheet
containing these algorithms.

<H2><A NAME="5.">5. Data Acquisition Methods:</A></H2>

Changes in live biomass and dead matter, above and below ground,
were measured at monthly intervals (Menaut and Cesar, 1979).
<P>
Dry weight of each above ground category was determined each month
by clipping to ground level within 16 quadrats of 1.0 m2, selected
randomly from a total of 192 potential quadrat locations. Clipped
material was immediately sorted into live and standing dead, and
litter (fallen dead matter) was harvested from the ground. Samples
were weighed fresh before drying.
<P>
Below-ground plant matter was sampled by extracting blocks of
soil, 20 cm x 20 cm, in successive 10 cm layers to 1.0 m depth.
The soil was considered too gravely and too hard in the dry season
to permit use of soil augers or corers (gouges). Only four soil
blocks were sampled per month. 80% of root biomass was found in
the top 30 cm. Soil cores were washed over a 2 mm sieve, and live
and dead roots were separated from only one soil block per month.
<P>
All sorted plant matter was weighed fresh before oven drying to
constant weight at 95 C.
<P>
Decomposition above-ground was accounted for by estimating a mean
monthly disappearance rate for leaf litter (7.6% for <I>Loudetia</I>
savanna) according to the methods of Weigert and Evans (1964)
and Lomnicki <I>et al.</I> (1968).

<H3>Limitations of the Data:</H3>
Net primary production of grasslands is subject to a number of
different methods of estimation from biomass data, some of which
may be inappropriate for particular biome types. Methodology of
estimation/calculation needs to be taken into account, as well
as methodology of measurement, when making comparisons between
different regions. Errors in biomass measurement may also occur
between different study sites. For short time series of data it
may be assumed that measurement methodology remains consistent;
however, over very long time series changes in staff, tools, etc.
may lead to &quot;calibration&quot; errors.
