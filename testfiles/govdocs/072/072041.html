<p>

<font face="helvetica,arial">
The OzFACE facility is now fully operational at our tropical savanna site at Yabulu, 
about 20km north of Townsville. Construction commenced in December 2000 and was 
completed in April 2001. Campbell Scientific Australia, with some assistance from 
Campbell Scientific in the US, designed and constructed the system. The FACE system 
consists of six rings, each 15 m in diameter. The vegetation enclosed by two rings 
is exposed to ambient CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> (370ppm), two rings are exposed to a CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> level of 450 ppm 
and the remaining two rings are exposed to CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> concentrations of 550 ppm. Within 
these plot areas, one third of the area is left intact, one third is clipped to 
simulate grazing and one third has nutrients added to simulate higher fertility 
savanna locations. Local eucalypt and acacia seedlings have been planted to study 
woody-grass dynamics, which is a critical issue in savannas, in terms of current 
land management practices and the impacts of future climate. It was not possible to 
include mature eucalypts or acacias within the FACE rings. 
<p>

Measurements include net primary productivity and species abundances, plant basal 
area, forage quality, a range of plant physiological measures, plant defence 
compounds, plant phenology, litter decomposition, soil respiration, soil moisture 
(NMM and TDR monthly), soil fauna, soil organic carbon. Through collaboration we 
hope to look at root turnover using mini-rhizotrons.
<p>

The FACE design is an octagonal system with small blowers attached to each of the 
eight 100mm PVC pipes in each ring. We have a two stage CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> control process. For 
each ring we have four solenoids of different capacities controlling overall release 
of CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> to the ring and finer level control is provided for each segment with 2 
solenoids (the segment most perpendicular to the wind releases at proportionately 
1.0 and the two side segments at 0.7). CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> is injected into the plenums immediately 
in front of the blowers. We have the IRGAs in the middle of each ring to reduce 
delay time in CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> sampling.
<p>

We have been testing the system for the last month or so and at this stage we are 
within 10% of the setpoint 80% of the time (one minute averages) during the day. 
However, at night we are within 10% of the setpoint only about 65% of the time 
because of almost zero wind. We expect further improvements as we fine tune the PID 
algorithm. Currently our CO<font size=-1><sub>2</sub></font> use is about 1.5 tonnes from 6am to 6pm and about 
0.7 tonnes between 6pm and 6am. Wind gusts in the afternoon can reach 15 m/s and 
often average 6 m/s. We have constructed a portable spatial sampling system and 
spatial control looks pretty good so far though we can only test one ring at a time.
