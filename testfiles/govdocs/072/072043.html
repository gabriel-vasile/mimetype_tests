<p>August 24, 1999</p>

<p>Atlanta -- The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a public
health agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, announced today the
availability of the draft results of its public health assessment for the <b>Savanna Army
Depot in Savanna, Illinois.</b></p>

<p>Public health assessments report information about hazardous substances in the
environment and evaluate whether exposure to those substances in the past, present or
future could harm people in the area. They identify health studies or other activities
that might be needed and make recommendations to other government agencies, such as the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and state and local health and
environmental departments, concerning actions to protect public health.</p>

<p>In preparing public health assessments, ATSDR health assessors rely on various sources
of information. These sources may include: environmental data, health data, and reports of
community concerns. Environmental data detail the chemicals at a site and indicate their
potential pathways to reach humans. Health data include reports of injury, disease or
death in the community, as well as information on the known human effects of chemicals at
the site. Reports of community concerns document the public&#146;s descriptions of how the
site affects their health and quality of life.</p>

<p>The health assessment will be made available for public review and comment on or about <b>August
27, 1999, </b>at the following repositories:</p>

<p><b>Savanna Public Library<br>
326 Third Street<br>
Savanna, IL 61074<br>
Telephone: (815) 273-3714</p>

<p>Hanover Public Library<br>
204 Jefferson Street<br>
Hanover, IL 61041<br>
Telephone: (815) 591-3517</p>
</b>

<p>The public comment period for the health assessment will run from <b>August 27, 1999,
until September 26, 1999.</b></p>

<p>Please send written comments to:</p>

<p><strong>Chief, Program Evaluation, Records and Information Services Branch<br>
ATSDR<br>
1600 Clifton Road, NE, Mailstop E-56<br>
Atlanta, Georgia 30333</strong></p>

<p>Comments received during the public comment period will be logged and become part of
the administrative record for the health assessment. Comments (without indication of who
made them) and responses will be included in an appendix to the final health assessment.
Although names of those who have submitted comments will not be included in the final
health assessment, they are subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>Community members seeking information on the procedures or content of the health
assessment should contact ATSDR Health Assessor Mark Weber, toll free, at </p>

<p>1-888-42-ATSDR (1-888-422-8737). Callers should refer to the &quot;Savanna Army Depot
