 REPORT  AND  ORDER  (Proceeding  Terminated) 
 Adopted:  July  26,  2006  Released:  July  28,  2006 
 By  the  Assistant  Chief,  Audio  Division,  Media  Bureau: 
 1.  The  Audio  Division  has  before  it  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  issued  at  the  request  of  Charles  Crawford  (“  Petitioner”),  proposing  the  allotment  of  Channel  275A  at  Savanna,  Oklahoma,  as 
 the  community’s  first  local  aural  transmission  service.  Petitioner  has  stated  that  he  will  file  an  application  to  operate  a  FM  station  at  Savanna  if  the  requested  channel  is  allotted.  A  later  filed  minor  change 
 application  1  filed  by  JDC  Radio,  Inc.,  licensee  of  Station  KQIB(  FM),  Channel  275C3,  Idabel,  Oklahoma,  conflicts  with  the  proposed  Savanna  allotment.  This  application  has  been  treated  as  a  counterproposal  in 
 this  proceeding.  2  Petitioner  filed  comments  reiterating  his  interest  in  the  allotment  and  pledging  to  file  an  application  if  the  channel  is  allotted.  No  other  comments  or  counterproposals  were  filed. 


 2.  In  evaluating  mutually  exclusive  allotment  proposals,  we  compare  the  proposed  arrangements  of  allotments  using  the  FM  allotment  priorities  set  forth  in  Revision  of  FM  Assignment 
 Policies  and  Procedures.  3  We  will  allot  Channel  275A  at  Savanna  because  it  would  satisfy  the  third  allotment  priority,  first  local  service,  as  compared  to  Station  KQIB(  FM)  ’s  application,  which  proposes  a 
 modification  of  an  existing  station,  which  would  satisfy  the  fourth  allotment  priority,  other  public  interest  matters. 


 3.  We  will  allot  Channel  275A  at  Savanna,  Oklahoma,  as  the  community’s  first  local  aural  transmission  service.  Savanna  is  an  incorporated  community  with  a  2000  U.  S.  Census  population  of  730 
 persons.  Savanna  has  its  own  mayor,  post  office,  volunteer  fire  department,  city  offices  and  a  number  of  local  churches. 


 4.  Channel  275A  is  allotted  to  Savanna  in  compliance  with  the  Commission’s  rules  provided  there  is  a  site  restriction  of  7.0  kilometers  (4.3  miles)  south  at  coordinates  34-  46-  00  NL  and  95-

 denied,  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order,  56  RR  2d  448  (1983).  The  FM  allotment  priorities  are:  (1)  first  full-  time  aural  service;  (2)  second  full-  time  aural  service;  (3)  first  local  service;  and  (4)  other  public  interest  matters.  Co-  equal 


 weight  is  given  to  priorities  (2)  and  (3).
