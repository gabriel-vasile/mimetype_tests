ABSTRACT

Brown, S, and Greg Gaston.  1996. Tropical Africa:  Land Use, Biomass, and 
Carbon Estimates for 1980.  NDP-055, Carbon Dioxide Information Center, Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

This document describes the contents of a digital database containing 
maximum potential aboveground biomass, land use, and estimated biomass and 
carbon data for 1980.  The biomass data and carbon estimates are associated 
with woody vegetation in Tropical Africa. These data were collected to reduce 
the uncertainty associated with estimating historical releases of carbon from 
land use change. Tropical Africa is defined here as encompassing 22.7 x 10E6 
km2 of the earth's land surface and is comprised of countries that are located 
in tropical Africa (Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central 
African Republic, Chad, Congo, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, 
Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, 
Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe 
(Rhodesia), Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo,
Uganda, Burkina Faso (Upper Volta), Zaire, and Zambia).

The database was developed using the GRID module in the ARC/INFO (TM
geographic information system. Source data were obtained from the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center, and 
a limited number of biomass-carbon density case studies. These data were used 
to derive the maximum potential and actual (ca. 1980) aboveground biomass 
values at regional and country levels. The land-use data provided were derived 
from a vegetation map originally produced for the FAO by the International 
Institute of Vegetation Mapping, Toulouse, France.

Analyses conducted with this database found that 18% of Tropical Africa was 
classified as closed forest and 36% was classified as open forest in 1980. 
Forested lands contained over 138E+09 Mg of aboveground live 
biomass, which is equivalent to 69E+09 Mg of carbon. Closed forests and open 
forests had mean aboveground biomass values of 209 Mg/ha and 67 Mg/ha, 
respectively, in 1980. These values are down from maximum potential 
aboveground live biomass values of 296 Mg/ha for closed forest and 108 Mg/ha 
for open forest.

Keywords:  Carbon release, climate change, deforestation, forestry, population.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
-------------------------

This database was developed by Sandra Brown, Louis Iverson, Ariel
Lugo, Anantha Prasad, Greg Gaston, and others between 1990 and 1994.
The primary contract that supported the collection of the data was the U.S. 
Department of Energy, Office of Health and Environmental Research, contract 
DEFG02-90ER61081. Additional support was obtained from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency through its post doctoral fellowship program, which is 
administered by the National Research Council.

Human-induced changes in the Earth's land cover may influence ecological and
climatic systems.  The potential for these changes to have regional or global
implications makes the task of developing an all-inclusive general circulation
model (GCM) with predictive capabilities essential.  However, to accurately
predict the effects of long-term increases in the number and concentration of
greenhouse gases on climate, GCMs require information on the timing and 
magnitude of past releases of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, water 
vapor, and a host of other anthropogenic gases. An understanding of all of the
major processes leading to the release (sources) and storage (sinks) of these 
gases over time is also essential.

The prediction of regional trends in climate will be problematic until a 
well- documented understanding of the past, present, and possible future usage 
of fossil fuels and land is reached.  Such an understanding is possible only 
with the concerted effort of many investigators from a diverse set of 
disciplines.  The perspectives of ecologists, biologists, historians, 
geographers, foresters, mathematicians, physicists, and others are needed if 
a multifaceted examination of the causes and consequences of land-cover change 
and human population growth on the world's climate is to be conducted.

Reductions in the amount of carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems are 
partially responsible for the increase in the concentration of atmospheric 
CO2 that has occurred since 1850 (Houghton 1993).  For example, live
vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems is estimated to have contained over 900 Pg
of carbon, with 90% of this being in forests, prior to any intentional land 
clearing on Earth (Olson et al. 1985, Dale et al. 1991).

A decline in the amount of carbon sequestered in vegetation has been 
associated with the rapid increase of human population that began during the 
industrial revolution.  This population growth created demands for food and 
forest products that were fulfilled through the clearing and conversion of 
large tracts of forest to agriculture and other uses.  This land-cover change 
has direct impacts on the concentration of atmospheric CO2.  For example, a 1% 
change in the total amount of carbon stored in living vegetation would release 
about 21 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere, almost four times the present annual 
emission from fossil fuels (Houghton 1993).

2. SOURCE AND SCOPE OF THE DATA
-------------------------------

This numeric data package (NDP-055) describes a land-use and biomass
database for Tropical Africa that contains 1980 land cover, maximum potential
aboveground biomass, and biomass estimates for woody vegetation in 1980. In
addition, the database includes information on human populations in each
nation and sub-national political unit in Tropical Africa for the years 1960,
1970, 1980, and 1990. These data were collected to reduce the uncertainty
associated with the possible magnitude and time course of historical releases
of carbon from land-cover change and may be used by demographers, historians,
geographers, and other researchers interested in the relationship between land
cover change, land degradation, climate, and anthropogenic activities.

For purposes of this NDP, Tropical Africa is defined as encompassing
nearly 22.7 x 1E6 km2 of the world's surface and includes the following 
countries: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African 
Republic, Chad, Congo, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Gabon, 
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, 
Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe 
(Rhodesia), Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, 
Uganda, Burkina Faso (Upper Volta), Zaire, and Zambia. As defined here 
Tropical Africa does not include countries in Mediterranean and southern 
Africa (i.e., Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Western Sahara, South 
Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland).

The major effort in the compilation of this database involved the acquisition
and processing of the source data sets.  Most of these data sets were acquired 
from the United Nations Environmental Program's (UNEP) Global Resources 
Information Database (Jaakkola 1990) or from the United Nation's Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO 1993).  These data, in turn, were input, 
georeferenced, and converted into a raster format as needed using an 
ARC/INFO (TM) geographic information system (GIS).  The spatial data sets used 
in the development of this NDP are as follows:

1.  National boundaries were derived from the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency's
    Digital Chart of the World at a scale of 1:1,000,000.  Boundaries for
    subnational political units were derived from The New International 
    Atlas, the Encyclopedia of the Nations, and the FAO's Tropical Forest 
    Resources Assessment Program 1990 population data (Worldmark Press 1984,
    Rand McNally 1980).  Boundaries for large water bodies (e.g. Lake Victoria) 
    were copied from the Digital Chart of the World; moderate-size dlakes 
    (>20 km in length in any direction) were digitized from the UNESCO 
    Vegetation Map of Africa, scale 1:5,000,000 (UNESCO/AETFAT/UNSO 1981, 
    White 1983).

2.  Population density data for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 for national and
    subnational political units were provided by M. Lorenzini and K.D. Singh,
    FAO, Tropical Forest Resources Assessment Program 1990 (FAO 1993).

3.  Elevation data were derived from a global digital elevation database
    originally developed by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency (ETOPO5).  The 
    elevation data were reclassified into 15-m increments, and all bathymetry
    data were set to zero.

4.  Soils data were derived from the FAO Soils Map of the World (FAO 1971-81).      The soils data were reclassified into five soil texture classes, five 
    slope classes, and two soil depth classes and were used in calculating 
    the maximum potential biomass values included with this database.  These 
    soil data are not included with this NDP.

5.  Climatic data were obtained from the FAO agro-meteorology database and two
    maps were developed using the spatial coordinates for each station and the 
    mean monthly precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, 
    day-night temperature differential, evapotranspiration rate, and vapor 
    pressure.  The first map is a isopleth map of annual precipitation and the 
    second is of an integrated climate index that provides a measure of the 
    growing season length based on five climatic variables (Weck 1970).

6.  Vegetation data represent conditions in 1980 (approximate date) from the 
    FAO Vegetation Map of Africa (Lavenu 1987).


3. DATA MANIPULATION AND INTERPOLATION
--------------------------------------

The methodology described in Iverson et al. (1994) and Brown and Gaston 
(1995) (reprinted in Appendix B) was used to compute degradation ratios.  
These degradation ratios were applied to a map of maximum potential 
aboveground biomass density to develop a map of current (ca. 1980) aboveground 
biomass. Since the linear regression models used to estimate the degradation 
ratios were calibrated for woody vegetation only, this map was masked using 
a land cover map (1980).  All areas not in a forested or wooded class were 
deleted.  This process resulted in a map showing the amount of aboveground 
biomass in woody vegetation for 1980.  The change (emission) of carbon 
resulting from land use change and land degradation between the 1880s and 1980 
can be estimated for closed and open forests by comparing the aboveground 
biomass map with the maximum potential aboveground biomass density map.

Two of the data sources used in calculating the maximum potential aboveground 
biomass values needed additional processing before they could be used in the 
biomass estimation model.  First, the meteorology data were used to calculate 
a climatological index for each station based on a modified version of Weck's 
(1970) methodology.  Second, these climatological indices (point data) were 
interpolated into a thematic map using a thin-plate spline technique (Iverson 
et al. 1994).  Lastly, the FAO vegetation map used (Lavenu 1987) was 
reclassified from over 64 ecosystem types into a map showing closed forest, 
open forest, grassland savanna, and other non forested lands.  See Appendix C
for a description of the reclassification scheme used.

The source data were then projected into a cylindrical equal-area projection
using a central meridian of 15 degrees east and a standard parallel of 
0 degrees.  This equal-area versions of the source data were then converted 
into grids (cellsize 5km)  using the ARC/INFO (TM) POLYGRID command.


4. MODELING BIOMASS
-------------------
The maximum potential biomass density of woody vegetation is assumed to be 
the product of a combination of the prevailing climatic and geomorphic 
conditions in an area.  To estimate the maximum potential biomass for each grid
cell, each input layer (i.e., mean annual precipitation, climate index, 
elevation/slope, and soil quality/texture) was recoded and assigned values
ranging from 1 to 25 based on the perceived importance of the layer to the 
growth of woody vegetation.  A weighted overlay of the four layers was then 
performed to create a biomass index with a minimum possible value of 4 and a 
maximum value of 100 (in Tropical Africa the values ranged from 40 to 100).

The climate-related layers (mean annual precipitation and climate index) 
account for 50% of the possible index value.  The soil layer accounts for 25% 
and the elevation and slope layer [formed by combining the elevation data 
(maximum value 13) with the slope data (maximum value 12)] accounts for the 
remaining 25%.  Iverson et al. (1994) used the same weighting scheme for 
Tropical Asia.  This scheme was found to give satisfactory results for Africa 
when compared to available literature for the region (Graham et al. 1990, 
Martin 1991, Lavenu 1987).

Potential biomass density (PBD) indices for forests, woodlands, and woody 
savannas were calibrated by assigning aboveground biomass density estimates 
(obtained from the literature) to the range of index values.  This task posed a 
challenge because few measurements of mature forest biomass have been taken in 
this region (Brown and Lugo 1982).  The highest reported biomass densities 
were about 500 Mg/ha (Huttel and Bernhard-Reversat 1975, Huttel 1975) for 
tropical moist forests in western Africa.  Western Africa is also associated
with the highest range of PBD indices (>96).  A PBD index value of 51 
was assumed to represent the lower limit for tree or shrub savannas and was 
assigned a biomass density of 15 Mg/ha based on data in Lamotte (1975), 
Lamotte and Bourliere (1983), and Menaut et al. (1991).  It was then assumed 
that biomass density exhibited a logistic-shaped function between the PBD 
index and biomass.  Biomass values (in Mg/ha) were assigned to the PBD values 
as shown in Table 2.  The lower index value (i.e., ~40) and upper index value 
(i.e., 100) for Tropical Africa were equated with 1Mg/ha and with 500 Mg/ha, 
respectively.  Between these two bounds the potential biomass index was divided
into twelve ranges.  Intermediate values of biomass density were obtained or 
estimated from Greenland and Kowal (1960), Pierlot (1966), Feson et al. (1974),
and Brown et al. (1994).

The remainder of this methodology is designed for woody vegetation only.  
Thus, the next step in determining the actual biomass in forests for 1980 was 
to remove non-woody vegetation associations from the map of maximum potential 
biomass density that is distributed with this database.  This was done by 
taking the reclassified FAO vegetation map for 1980 (Lavenu 1987) [i.e., with 
four classes:  closed forest, open forest (woodland/wooded savanna), grassland 
savanna, and other] and setting those grid cells with closed forest or open 
forest to a value of 1.  All other cells were set to NODATA.  This temporary 
map was multiplied by the potential biomass density map.  This process set or
masked most grid cells that were not classified as woody vegetation (as of 1980)
to NODATA.  The resulting maximum potential biomass density map, therefore, is
of forested areas only.  The only non-wooded areas remaining in this map are 
grid cells located within lakes.

To estimate the actual biomass remaining in live woody vegetation in 1980,
researchers developed degradation ratios based on population data and applied 
them to the maximum potential biomass density map for forested lands.  The 
degradation ratios were based on the assumption that the degree to which 
forests are reduced from their potential biomass is a function of the 
population density and forest type or ecofloristic zone.  For example, high 
population densities will result in low degradation ratios (i.e., highly 
degraded forests), and drier regions will be degraded more severely than 
moist regions because of the ability of moist forests to replace biomass faster
(Brown and Lugo 1982).

Other socioeconomic factors such as the ratio of rural to urban population, 
the importance of subsistence versus export-oriented agriculture, and the state
of industrialization affects the rate of biomass reduction.  In developed 
countries a population density and a stage of industrial development 
have been reached at which no further biomass loss occurs and other factors 
come into play, which may actually lead to increases in biomass (Flint 
and Richards 1994).

In most of Tropical Africa this threshold has not been reached, as 
exemplified by the fact that 90% of the population in Africa still uses wood 
for cooking.  The average amount of wood used for cooking per family is 
equivalent to about 1.5 tons of fuel oil per year.  It has been estimated that 
the annual addition to the fuelwood supply through the growth of biomass was 
less than consumption in 1980 and that the half-life of tree stocks (the time 
it would take for stocks to decline by 50%) averaged about 25 years in 1980.  
Furthermore, tree stocks are declining at accelerating rates because 
consumption is increasing exponentially with population growth (Anderson and 
Fishwick 1984).

Degradation equations have been estimated for two forest types (closed 
forest and woodland/wooded savanna) by comparing the potential biomass 
density in 1980 with biomass densities obtained from forest inventories for 
the same location.  This process produced unitless factors that indicate the 
reduction from potential biomass to actual biomass as a function of population 
density.  Eight reliable forest inventories for Tropical Africa were used to 
develop the degradation equations (Clement and Nouvellet 1978, Development 
and Resources Corporation 1967, Republique de Cote d'Ivoire 1975, United 
Nations 1972, FAO 1989). Due to the limited number of suitable forest 
inventories of tropical Africa, 27 additional inventories from tropical South 
and Southeast Asia were also included in the analysis (Iverson et al. 1994).

The data for the closed forest zone of Tropical Africa were combined with 
the moist forest data from South and Southeast Asia, while data for the 
woodland/wooded savanna zone were combined with the dry forest data from South 
and Southeast Asia.  A least-squares regression was conducted for each zone, 
and the following degradation equations were produced.

The equations, sample sizes, and correlation results for closed forest are:

PD >  12:   DR = 0.847 - 0.091 ln (PD), (n = 25, r2 = 0.72),   (1a)
PD <= 12:   DR = 1 - 0.032 PD,                                 (1b)

where DR is the degradation ratio and PD is the population density in people 
per km2. 

The equations, sample sizes, and correlation results for open forest 
(woodland/wooded savanna) are:

PD >  7:    DR = 0.866 - 0.118 ln (PD), (n = 10, r2 = 0.54),      (2a)
PD <= 7:    DR = 1 - 0.050 PD,                                    (2b)

where DR is the degradation ratio and PD is the population density in people 
per km2.

Equation 1a and 2a for each forest type is based on the range of available 
data, and the minimum PD for which it is applicable.  For PDs less than these 
minimums, simple linear equations (Eq. 1b and 2b) were developed between the DR
at zero PD (assumed to be one), and the value of DR from equation 1a and 2a at 
the minimum PD.  A linear function of PD was then calculated for each land 
cover class between these DR values.

Use of the natural logarithm in equations 1a and 2a allows negative DR 
values to occur for PDs greater than 11,022 for closed forest and 1,539 for 
the open forest (woodland/wooded savanna) land cover classes.  This was not a 
problem in most cases, however, since forest lands tend to have lower 
population densities.  For this reason,  calculated DR values less than 0.1 
were reset to 0.1.

The actual-biomass-density map for 1980 is the product of the 
potential-biomass- density map for woody vegetation, the population density map
for 1980 stratified by land cover type (closed forest and open forest), and 
the calculated degradation ratios.  The map of actual biomass densities for 
1980 was calculated on a cell-by-cell basis.  All cells within a political 
unit were assigned the same population density value.  The forest strata, 
however, may vary within a political unit causing the degradation equation 
used to vary.  Thus, the map of actual biomass density for woody vegetation 
in 1980 reflects the predicted maximum potential biomass, the forest type 
stratification, and the population density in 1980.

Due to the coarse scale of the input data used in generating the potential 
biomass density map, some large water bodies within Africa were not 
represented.  Boundaries for large water bodies (e.g., Lake Victoria) and 
moderate-sized lakes (>20 km in length in any direction) were digitized and 
entered into a lake coverage (map).  Following a process similar to that used 
for the land cover data, those grid cells within a lake (i.e., > 50%) were 
given a value of NODATA, and the remainder were set to one.  This coverage was 
multiplied by the grid cells in the map of actual biomass density for 1980
to set all "wet" grid cells to NODATA.

This final map of actual live aboveground biomass density only contains 
lands that were in closed forest (moist forest and seasonal forest) or open 
forest (woodland/wooded savanna) in 1980 (per Lavenu 1987).  The final map 
contains 4,025,275 km2 of closed forest land with a mean biomass 
density of 208.7 Mg/ha and 8,156,575 km2 of open forest land (woodland/ wooded 
savanna) with a mean biomass density of 67.1 Mg/ha.  As expected, the minimum 
biomass densities were located in lowland dry zones to the north and south, 
maximum values were located in the humid lowlands in southwest and south
central Africa (i.e., Congo, Gabon, Zaire), and highland areas had slightly 
less biomass than their lowland counterparts.  The presence of these known 
patterns increased our confidence in this methodology and its ability to 
generate reasonable estimates of biomass density for Tropical Africa.

The primary product of this GIS methodology is the actual biomass density
information for woody vegetation in 1980. Actual biomass density in year X 
may be determined (as described for 1980) using a land-cover map and population
data for year X (e.g., 1990). The results may then be compared to determine 
the change in biomass (carbon) of woody vegetation in the intervening years.  

The biomass for 1980 may also be compared to the maximum potential aboveground 
biomass for the region.  The difference between the mean maximum potential 
biomass density for closed forest lands and the mean actual biomass density 
in 1980 is 86.9 Mg/ha (40.5 Mg/ha for open forest).  On the basis of the 
average biomass to carbon conversion factor of 1 kg of wood to 0.5 kg of 
carbon (Smith 1991), and the assumption that the removed wood was eventually 
burned, the amount of CO2, CO, CH4, and other gases emitted from this per ha 
reduction in biomass may be estimated for closed and open forests.  Table 3
shows the estimated emission of CO2, CO, and CH4 that would have occurred if 
86.9  (40.5) Mg of dry biomass were burned using traditional West African 
stoves, based on emission factors calculated by Brocard et al. (1995).  (If 
forest fire based emission factors were used the emission of CO2 and CO would 
increase while the amount of CH4 and carbon in the "other" category 
would decrease.)

Africa had an estimated total population of 100 million people in 1650 (density
of 0.03 people per km2).  Two hundred years later (1850) the population
was still around 100 million (Udo 1982).  Thus, it may be assumed that prior to 
the colonial period, which began in the mid to late 1800s, the amount of land 
in forests had remained relatively stable for over two hundred years.  Since 
the land in the closed forest and open forest (woodland/wooded savanna) 
land-cover classes in 1980 were located in the interior of larger forests in 
1880, it can be assumed that they were at or near their maximum potential 
biomass density at the beginning of the colonial period.  If this was the case,
the emission of CO2 due to the degradation of these forested lands (i.e., 
reduction of biomass from the maximum potential to the "actual" biomass in 
1980) would total 27.21E+12 kg/C.  If this CO2 had been emitted at a 
constant rate since 1880, 272.1E+06 Mg C per year would have been released 
into the atmosphere.  To put this figure into perspective, Houghton and Hackler
(1995) calculated that the regional net flux of carbon in Tropical Africa from 
all land-use changes was 238.69E+06 Mg C in 1980 and had increased to 
341.5E+06 Mg C by 1990.


5. LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE DATA
-------------------------------------------

The following paragraphs list the limitations and caveats that should be
considered when using this database.  Failure to consider these limitations 
could result in erroneous interpretations of the data.

1.  All data coverages (maps) in this database have been resampled into 5 x 5 km
    grid cells.  This cell size and the small cartographic scale of most of the
    input data used preclude the use of these data for site-specific studies.

2.  The soil texture, slope, and elevation data used in the development of the
    map of maximum potential aboveground biomass densities were based on 
    small-scale data sources (1:1,000,000 to 1:5,000,000).

3.  The climate data were extrapolated into areas with little or no data.  
    Consequently, effects of local topography on precipitation and temperature 
    patterns are not considered in the map of maximum potential aboveground 
    biomass.

4.  The population data used to calculate the degradation ratios are based on
    national internal political subdivisions as of 1980.  The population data 
    provided with this database (i.e., for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990) are 
    keyed to these 1980 divisions.

5.  The limited number of forest inventories in Tropical Africa makes 
    verification of the final map of actual biomass density for woody 
    vegetation in 1980 difficult.  However, average biomass densities were 
    obtained for Guinea, Gambia, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso from national 
    level forest inventories and compared to those calculated here.  The 
    values for Guinea, Gambia, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso were within 3%, 
    19%, 3%, and 38%, respectively, of the inventory values (Brown and Gaston 
    1995).


6. DATA CHECKS PERFORMED BY CDIAC
---------------------------------

An important part of the data packaging process at the Carbon Dioxide 
Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) is the quality assurance (QA) of the data 
before its distribution.  The QA process is an important component of the 
value-added concept of ensuring accurate, usable information.  The complete QA 
of a data set can be a time- consuming process, since data received by CDIAC 
are rarely in condition for immediate distribution, regardless of source.  The 
following summarizes the QA checks performed on the various data groups 
presented in this document.

1.  The map of maximum potential aboveground biomass density is derived from an 
index calculated from six climatic and geomorphic variables.  The index values 
were associated with the known upper and lower limits of biomass density in 
Africa, and the range was divided into 12 density groupings (See Table 2).  
The maximum potential aboveground biomass density map (5x5 km grid cells) was 
correlated with a 1x1 degree map of carbon in live vegetation (Olson et al. 
1983).  The analysis obtained an r<sup>2</sup> value of 0.4, n = 1195611, 
and alpha  =  0.0001.  Because of cell size differences, a higher correlation 
value should not be expected;  however, the significance of the correlation 
(>99%) implies that the two independently derived data sources are measures of 
the same variable.

2.  The map of maximum potential aboveground biomass (5x5 km grid cells) and 
the Olson et al. (1983) 1 x 1 degree map of carbon in live vegetation were 
printed and visually compared to ensure that the location of low and high 
carbon/biomass densities matched.

3.  The land-use map for 1980 derived from Lavenu (1987) was printed and 
compared to a similar map prepared by the United Nations (White 1983).

4.  On the basis of QA steps 2 and 3, it was determined that neither the land 
cover nor potential-biomass-density map had accounted for internal water bodies
in Tropical Africa.  A new map was created for use with this database that 
contains all permanent (versus seasonal) lakes larger than 20 km in length in 
any direction.

5.  The population data for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990, were aggregated by 
country and compared to secondary data sources (e.g., WorldMark Press 1984, Udo 
1982, and Goode 1992).

6.  The final actual-biomass-density map for 1980 was aggregated on a 
cell-by-cell basis to obtain the mean biomass density by country (see 
Appendix A).  These mean values were compared with national level forest 
inventories available for Guinea, Gambia, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso to 
ensure that the calculated values were within accepted ranges for tropical 
regions of the world.


5. DESCRIPTION OF DATA PROCESSING ROUTINE 
-----------------------------------------

The data distributed with this NDP were initially received as ARC/INFO GRIDs 
and the base map used was derived from the 1:1,000,000- scale Digital Chart of 
the World developed by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency with additional 
information digitized from a 1:5,000,000 scale land use map of Africa 
(White 1983).  The data contained in this NDP are available as flat ASCII 
files and as ARC/INFO export files (*.e00).

The ARC/INFO GRID data is provided in two formats. This data was exported
using both the ARC/INFO EXPORT command and the ARC/INFO GRIDASCII command.
The ARC/INFO coverages were exported using the ARC/INFO EXPORT command and the
attribute information is provided in ASCII format. The biomass density values
are expressed in Mg per ha (i.e., 2 Mg of dry biomass = 1 Mg/C or 1 metric ton
of carbon).

The degradation ratio equations used in calculating BIO1980.ASC are described 
below. For a detailed description of these equations see Part 1, Section 8.2, 
of the documentation. (The documentation for NDP-055 is available free-of-charge
from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge, Tennessee).

Degradation equations were estimated for two ecofloristic zones [closed
forest and open forest (woodland/wooded savanna)] by comparing the potential
biomass density with current biomass and population densities obtained for the
same location. This process produced unitless factors that indicate the
reduction from potential biomass to "current" biomass as a function of
population density. A least-squares regression was then conducted for each
zone and the following degradation equations were produced. The equations,
sample size (n), and correlation coefficient for closed forest are:

PD  > 12:  DR = 0.847   0.091 ln (PD), (n = 25, r^2 = 0.72),   (1a)
PD <= 12:  DR = 1 - 0.032 PD .                                 (1b)

The equations, sample size, and correlation coefficient for open forest
(woodland/wooded savanna) are:

PD  > 7:    DR = 0.866   0.118 ln (PD), (n = 10, r^2 = 0.54),  (2a)
PD <= 7:    DR = 1 - 0.050 PD .                                (2b)

Where DR is the degradation ratio and PD is the population density in people
per km2.

The ndp055.txt (File 1) file is an ASCII text file (this document).


10. DESCRIPTION, FORMAT, AND PARTIAL LISTINGS OF THE DATA FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------

Table 1 lists and describes the files included in this numeric data package.

FLAT ASCII DATA FILES:

Eight flat ASCII data files are provided with this data package. These files
contain the same information as the ARC INFO grids and coverages included in 
this NDP.  The ASCII files were either created directly from the ARC/INFO grids
of the same name using the GRIDASCII command or are ASCII versions of ARC/INFO 
attribute tables associated with polygon coverages included in this NDP.  SAS 
and FORTRAN programs designed to read and print the contents of each ASCII 
data file are also provided. The information within these files will allow the 
user to ascertain population densities, the amount of land remaining in forests
in 1980, the maximum potential aboveground biomass densities within Africa, and
the biomass in aboveground woody vegetation in Tropical Africa in 1980. What 
follows is a description of the contents and formats (e.g., variable names, 
widths) of the eight flat ASCII data files distributed with this data package.

The flat ASCII files BIOMAX.ASC (File 4), LAKES.ASC (File 6), and LAND.ASC 
(File 8) are formatted as shown in the following FORTRAN code and may 
be read using the input/output programs INTGRID.FOR (File 9) or INTGRID.SAS 
(File 10).

BIOMAX.ASC contains maximum potential biomass density data in Mg/ha; LAND.ASC 
contains land-use information classified into four land-use categories; and 
LAKES.ASC contains the location of all non-seasonal lakes >20 km in any 
direction in Tropical Africa.  Each file of these three files contains header 
information containing a set of key words followed by cell (i.e., data) values 
in row-major order.  The first six lines of BIOMAX.ASC, LAKES.ASC, and LAND.ASC

The data are in a normal (type 1) cylindrical equal-area projection with
a central meridian of 15 degrees East longitude and a standard parallel of 0
degrees latitude. Data are provided for 1,502 rows and 1,534 columns, with the
first cell being located in the upper-left corner. Each data cell covers a 25
km2 square area, 5,000 m per side. The area covered by the data is bounded by 
a box with the following coordinates: lower-left -3616156.500, -3644063.04465;

ARC/INFO (Version 7.2.1) EXPORT FILES
Seven ARC/INFO export files (*.e00) are provided with this NDP. These files 
contain the same data as the flat ASCII data files described previously. The 
ARC/INFO export (*.e00) files were produced using the EXPORT command with the 
NONE option in ARC/INFO Version 7.2.1.  These files are in an uncompressed, 
fixed-block format that may be moved across computer systems. The coverages 
are in a normal (type 1) cylindrical equal-area projection with a central 
meridian of 15 degrees East longitude and a standard parallel of 0 degrees 
latitude. All units are in meters and the spheroid is a sphere with a radius 
of 6,370,997 meters (vs. the Clark 1866 spheroid).

The following files (BIOMAX.E00, LAND.E00, PD80.E00, LAKES.E00 and BIO1980.E00)
should be imported with the GRID option and contain 1,502 rows and 1,534 
columns, with each data cell covering a square area with 5,000m per side. The 
remaining files (T_AFR.E00 and  AFRICA.E00) are ARC/INFO polygon coverages and 
should be imported using the COVER option.  The polygon coverage AFRICA 
contains regions.  The region subclass within AFRICA is named SUM1980.  These 
regions were built using countries within Tropical Africa as unique 
identifiers.  The AFRICA.PAT.SUM1980 INFO file contains summary information by 
country for the amount of land and biomass in open and closed forests in 1980. 
The area covered by the data is bounded by a box with the following 
coordinates: lower-left -3616156.500, -3644063.04465; upper-right 4053843.500, 
3865936.955. A listing of the variable names and data formats for these last 
two export (E00) files are shown in Tables 6, and 7.

ABSTRACT
--------

One of the most important databases needed for estimating emissions of carbon
dioxide resulting from changes in the cover, use, and management of tropical
forests is the total quantity of biomass per unit area, referred to as biomass
density.  Forest inventories have been shown to be valuable sources of data for
estimating biomass density, but inventories for the tropics are few in number
and their quality is poor.  This lack of reliable data has been overcome by use
of a promising approach that produces geographically referenced estimates by
modeling in a geographic information system (GIS).  This approach has been
used to produce geographically referenced, spatial distributions of potential
and actual (circa 1980) aboveground biomass density of all forest types in
tropical Africa.  Potential and actual biomass density estimates ranged from
33 to 412 Mg/ha (10E06 g/ha) and 20 to 299 Mg/ha, respectively, for
very dry lowland to moist lowland forests and from 78 to 197 Mg/ha and 37
to 105 Mg/ha, respectively,  for montane-seasonal to montane-moist forests.
Of the 37 countries included in this study, more than half (51%) contained
forest that had less than 60% of their potential biomass.  Actual biomass
density for forest vegetation was lowest in Botswana, Niger, Somalia, and
Zimbabwe (about 10 to 15 Mg/ha).  Highest estimates for actual biomass
density were found in Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Liberia (305 to
344 Mg/ha).  Results from this research effort can contribute to reducing
uncertainty in the inventory of country-level emission by providing consistent
estimates of biomass density at subnational scales that can be used with other
similarly scaled databases on change in land cover and use.

APPENDIX C - RECLASSIFICATION SCHEME USED TO OBTAIN THE FOUR LAND USE
             CATEGORIES USED IN THIS NUMERIC DATA PACKAGE.

	The 64 land cover classes in the original FAO land cover map
(Lavenu 1987) were combined using the reclassification scheme shown here to
obtain the 4 land use categories used in this numeric data package.
