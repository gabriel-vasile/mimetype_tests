SAVANNA  LA MAR.                       201
Savanna la Mar, a little farther east, is a small settle-
ment of about a hundred houses, originally peopled by per-
sons from the Canaries, at the same time as its opposite
neighbour Samana. It is quite a small place, with a
scattered population of about 300 souls. In order to get
ashore, the same process is necessary as at Puerto Plata,
by boat and negro-back, or wading.
This village is, however, situated at the end of a plain
of great extent, being more than thirty miles long from
east to west, and extending some twelve miles to the
south, where the southern range of hills separates it from
the great plains of Seybo. All the land of this plain is
capable of extended agriculture, though now devoted
principally to grazing purposes, for which it is well
adapted, being well supplied with water from some nine
streams. This is, in fact, the only extent of land on
this side of, and adjacent to, the Bay of Samana capable of
culture.
The country round Samana is comparatively unsettled.
One sees here and there the huts of the natives, who are
engaged principally in " killing time," varied by a slight
stroke of manual labour in the small gardens or farms,
upon which grows most everything of its own accord that
can grow in a tropical country.
The women, with precious little apparel on themselves,
occupy their time gaining a livelihood washing for Others ;
but as household expenses are light with them, owing to
the fact that the principal sustenance is the plantain,
roasted or boiled, and the clothing and schooling of the
children costs nothing, since they have neither, they (the
people) do not need to earn a great deal, and therefore do not
make the effort. One meets them on the borders of the
shore with huge baskets on their heads filled with clothes,
the only garment worn by them being a loose semi-gown,
whilst following are members of the rising generation in
a happy state of nature.
