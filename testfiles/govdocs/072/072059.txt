2.0  Read Software Files
There are three sets of sample read programs for the Biomass Burning data set. These codes are written in the C language. These C programs have been tested on the Sun, SGI, Dec Alpha and HP UNIX-based workstations. All library functions in the C source codes are tested for ANSI C conformance. These files and their purposes are listed as follows:

bio_burn_res_fuel_read.c - reads the Biomass Burning 5 by 5 degree grid boxes residues and fuel 
                           data collected by Dr. Wei Min Hao and Mei-Huey Liu formatted ASCII 
                           files. This code is written in the C language.
bio_burn_sav_for_read.c -  reads the Biomass Burning 5 by 5 degree grid boxes savanna and forest 
                           data collected by Dr. Wei Min Hao and Mei-Huey Liu formatted ASCII 
                           files. This code is written in the C language.
bio_burn_total_read.c -    reads the Biomass Burning 5 by 5 degree grid boxes total biomass burned 
                           data collected by Dr. Wei Min Hao and Mei-Huey Liu formatted ASCII 
                           files. This code is written in the C language.


3.0  Creating C Executable Files

To build the executables for this data set from the command line, type out the following command:
	% cc -o read_5x5_hao_res_fuel bio_burn_res_fuel_read.c
	% cc -o read_5x5_hao_sav_for bio_burn_sav_for_read.c
	% cc -o read_5x5_hao_total bio_burn_total_read.c


4.0  Invoking Read Software
This section illustrates the invocation of the executable files. Section 4.1 describes how to run the read programs for the 5 by 5 grid boxes data set, BIO_BURN_5X5_HAO_NAT.

4.1  Running the Read Program for the BIO_BURN_5X5_HAO_NAT Data Set

There are three sample read software programs to read this data set. All of the read software are written in C. The read programs do not accept command line arguments. When these programs are executed, they request an input filename. The output file name is automatically created by appending ".rpt" to the input file name. This code assumes that the data and code are located in the same area. The report file generated will also be included in the local working area. After entering the file name, the user is presented with a parameter selection list. At this point, the program generates the report file and exits. Each read software is able to read particular files of the 
granules of data. 

The following line will begin program execution for the data files that contain 
residue and fuel data:

		% read_5x5_hao_res_fuel

The following line will begin program execution for the data files that contain savanna and forest data:
		% read_5x5_hao_sav_for

The following line will begin program execution for the data files that contain total data:
		% read_5x5_hao_total

A sample of the interactive program executions are provided in Section 6.0.


5.0  Data Sets Information

The following subsections provide information for the Biomass Burning data sets on-line at the Langley DAAC.

Data Set Name	                      Section
-------------                         -------
BIO_BURN_5X5_HAO_NAT	                5.1

 
Each set of the data set's information was obtained from the data files, documents, or directly from the data producer/provider. The high-level data set descriptions, the data files, the variables in the data files, and the contacts for data production are given under each data set. Some data sets contain the data producer's/provider's responses to questions on the data contents. These questions and/or responses are collected under the "NOTES ON DATA" section.

5.1  BIO_BURN_5X5_HAO_HDF Data Set

This data set is written in ASCII format. The data files are organized by study.

LONG NAME FOR THIS DATA SET:  Biomass Burning 5 degree by 5 degree grid data by Dr. Wei Min Hao 
                              and Dr. Mei-Huey Liu in Native Format (BIO_BURN_5X5_HAO_NAT)

FILE NAMING CONVENTION:       All three granules have the same naming convention. All three 
                              granules have the prefix "bio_burn_hao_" to indicate that they belong 
                              to this data set. The last two letters in each granule name represent 
                              location, "as" for Asia, "af" for Africa, and "am" for South America. 
                              Each granule consists of five data files. There are data for the 
                              forest, fuel, residue, savanna, and total data values.

VARIABLES:                    This section will provide a list of variables for each of the data 
                              files that make up a granule for this data set.
