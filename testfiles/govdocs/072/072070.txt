Brian,

Raytheon will have a crew at Savanna 11/4-6/2004.  They are sending me a
ship-to address for the tech's hotel and I'll pass it on to you as soon
as I get it.  Please ask Kirk to check out and prepare a T/RH sensor,
and send it to the hotel.  Please be sure to include a return FedEx
label and a hard copy of the O&M document in the package.

Thanks,
Seth

FYI,

The temperature/RH sensor at SAV1 has failed.  The controller can
communicate with the sensor, but even after a reset the sensor continues
to report 0.0C and 100% RH.
