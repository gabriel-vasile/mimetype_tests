	Description:
		Abstract: Open savanna-like coniferous forests are uncommon in western Washington except for a few areas, including the San Juan Islands and the southern edge of the Puget Lowlands. The south face of Mount Constitution, on one of the San Juan Islands (Orcas Island), contains a closed-canopy forest. The USGS, in collaboration with the University of Missouri, quantified the current structure of undisturbed closed canopy Douglas-fir forest on Orcas Island and compared it to reconstructed forest structure of the 19th century. The research documented a large increase in Douglas-fir tree density over the last century. A fire-history analysis conducted on relict (old, remaining trees) trees indicates that at least seven fires occurred on Mount Constitution since 1736, but only one fire has occurred since 1893. This suggests that fire exclusion is the primary cause of the recent increase in tree density. It is likely that high fire intensities with a high probability of crown fires, will kill the relict Douglas-fir in the future, given the current distribution of fuels in the understory on Orcas Island. The researchers suggest that manual thinning and repeated prescribed burns may be necessary to preserve the relict trees and to restore an open, Douglas-fir forest on Mount Constitution
