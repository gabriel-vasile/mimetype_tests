Title: Ennedi Plateau, Chad/Sudan Border, Africa

Description:

This view of the Ennedi Plateau (18.0N, 24.0E) shows the effects of severe 
wind erosion on this desert landscape in the far eastern portion of the 
Sahara Desert.  The dark areas are lava flows, the calderas have long ago 
been eroded by the desert winds.  The red toned surrounding surfaces are 
thick tropical soils, remnants of much earlier times when this region was a 
much greener savanna landscape that have also been severly eroded.
