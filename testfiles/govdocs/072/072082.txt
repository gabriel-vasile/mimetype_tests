We have documented red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) nesting activity at 45
locations along a 400-mile stretch of the Upper Mississippi River from Wabasha,
Minnesota to Keokuk, Iowa.  Only 5 active nesting territories have been found to
date in the 182-mile stretch of river south of Savanna, Illinois.  Among these, 3
are located in the Milan Bottoms Complex.  This site is on the Illinois side of the
river, immediately downstream of the Quad Cities metropolitan area
(approximately river miles 475.0 to 478.0).  Currently, red-shouldered hawks
(RSH) are classified as endangered species in Iowa and Illinois.  Due to the
presence of breeding RSH within Milan Bottoms during 1993, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Mississippi River Natural Resources Management Section
postponed four timber harvests (31 total acres) scheduled to occur in this area. 
Eventually, two of the proposed cuts were canceled and two cuts of 11 and 7 acres
were completed during the 1994-1995 winter.  Only the 11 acre harvest occurred
within the Milan Bottoms study area, while the 7 acre cut was carried out on an
adjacent island.  In order to better understand the response of RSH to small clear-cuts near their nesting territory, we monitored RSH reproductive success, foraging
habits, and habitat use during the 1995 and 1996 breeding seasons.  During both
field seasons we observed RSH foraging throughout the study area, including in
and near the 11 acre clear-cut.  In 1995, we located 3 active nest sites.  Three RSH
fledged from the Mill Creek nest, while two fledged from the Long Pond site. 
This nest was located in one of the originally proposed but canceled cuts.  The
Powerline nest, which was nearest the completed 11 acre harvest, failed to
produce any young.  In 1996, we were only able to relocate 2 of the active nests
from the previous year.  Two nestlings at the Mill Creek site reached an age of 10
to 14 days, but apparently died before fledging.  The Powerline nest once again
failed to produce any young.  Due to the extended period of high water in 1996,
we were unable to locate or determine the outcome at the Long Pond site. 
However, RSH territorial behavior seemed to indicate that the territory was indeed
still active.  Our results are extremely preliminary and more research is necessary
before definitive conclusions regarding the influence of small-sized clear-cuts on
RSH reproductive success can be stated.
