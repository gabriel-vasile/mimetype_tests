    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer is commonly called Bailey’s ecoregions and shows
        ecosystems of regional extent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the
        U.S. Virgin Islands.  Four levels of detail are included to show a
        hierarchy of ecosystems.  The largest ecosystems are domains, which are
        groups of related climates and which are differentiated based on
        precipitation and temperature.  Divisions represent the climates within
        domains and are differentiated based on precipitation levels and patterns
        as well as temperature.  Divisions are subdivided into provinces, which
        are differentiated based on vegetation or other natural land covers.  The
        finest level of detail is described by subregions, called sections, which
        are subdivisions of provinces based on terrain features.  Also identified
        are mountainous areas that exhibit different ecological zones based on
        elevation.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:7,500,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in
        the use of these data.
      Supplemental_Information:
        The same data are available from both the National Atlas of the United
        States and from the USDA Forest Service Inventory and Monitoring
        Institute.

        Detailed descriptions of the domains, divisions, and provinces represented
        in this map layer are available at:
        <http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/ecoregions/ecoreg1_home.html>.  Detailed
        descriptions of the sections represented in this map layer are available
        at: <http://www.fs.fed.us/land/pubs/ecoregions/>.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The USDA Forest Service ecoregions shapefile for the 48 conterminous
          States and the export file for Alaska were downloaded and reprojected to
          a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using ArcInfo.  The
          shorelines were removed and replaced with shorelines from the National
          Atlas States map layer.  Linework was cleaned and adjusted.  USDS Forest
          Service ecoregions attribution for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.
          Virgin Islands was added to the polygons for those areas defined by the
          National Atlas shorelines.

          The polygon attribution was checked and the following corrections were
          made: For Ecocode = -263A the Province field was blank; this was
          corrected to California Coastal Steppe-Mixed Forest-Redwood Forest
          Province.  For Ecocode = M242A, Ecocode = M242B, and Ecocode = M242C
          the Division was corrected from Marine Regime Mountains Redwood Forest
          Province to Marine Regime Mountains.

        Attribute_Definition:
          A subdivision of a division.  A province represents variations in

          areas that exhibit different ecological zones based on elevation
          (elevational zonation) are distinguished according to the character of
          the zonation by listing the elevational zones from lower to upper.  This
          is the third level in the hierarchy of ecoregions.
