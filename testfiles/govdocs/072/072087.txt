Title: STS-56 Earth observation of Perth in Western Australia

Description:

STS-56 Earth observation taken aboard Discovery, Orbiter Vehicle (OV) 103, 
is probably the best view of Perth in Western Australia.  (For orientation 
purposes, note that the coastline runs north and south).  The major feature 
on the coast is the large estuary of the Swan River.  The large port city
of  Perth is situated on the north bank and the smaller city of Freemantle
on the  south bank by the sea.  Smaller seaside towns trail off north and
south of  this center of urban life.  Inland lies a prominent escarpment,
more than 600  feet high, seen running down the middle of the view and
dividing the  lighter-colored coastal lowlands from the highlands where
dark-colored tree  savanna and desert scrub dominates the land.  The Moore
River can be seen  entering the sea at the top of the frame.  Rottnest
Island is visible in the  sea and Garden Island near bottom edge of the
frame.  Perth is the largest  economic center in Western Australia.  It
receives natural gas from an  offshore field hundreds of miles to the
north.  It lies 3,400 kilometers west  of Sydney on the opposite side of
this island continent.
