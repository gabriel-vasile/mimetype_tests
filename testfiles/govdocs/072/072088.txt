    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer is an Arc/INFO grid map of land cover characteristics for
        North America, excluding Hawaii, and including the Caribbean and most of
        Mexico.  The nominal spatial resolution is 1 km and the map layer is
        based on 1-km AVHRR data.  The data were compiled by staff at the National
        Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science as part of the Global
        Land Cover Characterization Project.  The land cover classes were produced
        using 1-km AVHRR data from April 1992 to March 1993.  Documentation and
        the original data are available at <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/>.
        The data available through the National Atlas of the United States are in
        GeoTIFF format.  This is a revised version of the May 2002 map layer, with
        a corrected shoreline for Greenland.

      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        continental level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of
        these data.
      Supplemental_Information:
        The following table describes the display of land cover characteristics
        classes in the TIFF image:

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The Land Cover image was downloaded from the EROS site
          <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/glcc_version1.html#NorthAmerica>.
          A header file was created from the information provided in the North
          America Documentation file located at
          <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/nadoc1_2.html>
          The header file consisted of the following parameters:
          >nrows 8996
          >ncols 9223
          >nbands 1

          >ulxmap -4487000.0
          >ulymap 4480000.0
          The data were converted from image format to ESRI GRID format using
          the command IMAGEGRID.  The file was then reprojected to change the
          latitude of projection center from 50 degress to 45 degrees.  A
          shoreline mask was created using the file shorelp020l.  It was used to
          add land areas not included in the Land Cover map, including some
          Aleutian islands, Hawaii, eastern Russia, Iceland, and half of
          Greenland.  These land areas were given a code of 255.  The image was
          truncated to cover the same area as shorelp020l, and the resulting
          file was converted to TIFF format using the RGB colors listed in the
          Supplemental_Information section.

          geometric distortion in the northwest part of the island between the
          Robeson Channel and Cape Morris Jesup, and to improve registration with
          a new, corrected coastline derived from World Vector Shoreline (WVS).

          A link coverage was created in ArcEdit containing links between the
          original Greenland data and the new coastline.  The link coverage was
          used in the Arc Adjust command to perform a linear transformation with
          nearest neighbor resampling on the original image, stored as an Arc/INFO
          grid dataset.  The resulting image is geometrically correct and fits the
          WVS coastline.  This correction was applied to data for Greenland only;
          the rest of the image was left unchanged.
