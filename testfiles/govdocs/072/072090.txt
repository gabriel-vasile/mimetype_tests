DATABASE OF TROPICAL BIOMASS BURNING
     

     This diskette contains 30 data files.  Each file contains
monthly and annual total biomass burned from each source.  All the
data are in 5ø x 5ø resolution.  The coordinate represents the left
upper corner of the grid cell.  Please notice that the data are the
amount of biomass burned, not the amount of CO2 produced. 

     Fifteen data files are compiled in SYMPHONY spreadsheet format
(with WR1 extension).  All the SYMPHONY files  can also be read in
LOTUS.  In addition, all those 15 symphony data files are also
converted to ASCII formats.  The format for each record in the
ASCII data files is described as followed:
