Question -   People in Puerto Rico use a plant for hypoglusemic
purposes. As a scientist I am looking for information regarding this
plant. the common name of it, is "planta de insulina" which translate in
english as the insuline plant. As a diabetic I been using it and it is
funtinal. Do you have some information about this plant? What is the
scientific name for it?

Hi Luis!
Diabetic people many times need to take insulin in order that his(or her)
body  work properly. Since the taking of insulin is tiring and sometimes
has  side-effects, many medical doctors and researchers in the world
look all the time for alternatives.
Science, 1999 May 7; 284: 974-977  has a paper about the discovery
of a new molecule that could possibly be used as an insuline alternative.
By other hand many specialists in Phytochemistry work looking for
medicinal applications for  the thousands (millions) vegetable species.
Many of them are found already used by the people  in the so-called
"common-sense medicine". And many times they work!
Sorry, i don't  know  of the plant used by the Puerto Rico people,
but i know of  a brazilian one, used for the same purpose.
It is a "leguminoseae" that  has the scientific name of Bauhinia
variegata.
I cannot affirm the results of its use. But i am glad to know that
you are taking this field of research. Good luck!
