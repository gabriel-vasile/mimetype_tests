BOREAS TE-09 NSA Photosynthetic Capacity and Foliage Nitrogen Data

Summary

The BOREAS TE-09 team collected several data sets related to chemical and 
photosynthetic properties of leaves in boreal forest tree species. This data set 
describes the spatial and temporal relationship between foliage nitrogen 
concentration and photosynthetic capacity in the canopies of black spruce, jack 
pine, and aspen.  The data were collected from June to September 1994 and are 
useful for modeling the vertical distribution of carbon fixation for different 
forest types in the boreal forest.  The data are available in tabular ASCII 
files.

1. Data Set Overview

This data set describes the relationship between foliage nitrogen concentration 
and photosynthetic capacity in the canopies of the BOReal Ecosystem Atmosphere 
Study (BOREAS) Northern Study Area (NSA)-Old Black Spruce (OBS), NSA-Upland 
Black Spruce (UBS), NSA-Old Jack Pine (OJP), NSA-Young Jack Pine (YJP) and NSA-
Old Aspen (OA).

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-09 NSA Photosynthetic Capacity and Foliage Nitrogen Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The canopy profiles of nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacity
were examined as part of an effort to characterize the spatial and temporal 
variations in photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen allocation in the boreal 
forest. This information will be useful for modeling the vertical distribution 
of carbon fixation for different forest types in the boreal forest. Samples were 
taken from five forest types in the NSA: NSA-OBS, NSA-UBS, NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP, and 
NSA-OA during each of the three Intensive Field Campaigns (IFCs) in 1994. 

Measurements were taken under controlled environmental conditions in the 
laboratory. An open gas exchange system in differential mode was used for 
measuring the photosynthetic capacity.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

This data set was collected and prepared to provide the profile of 
photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen concentration in the forest canopy of NSA-
OBS (Picea mariana Mill.),  NSA-UBS, NSA-OJP (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), NSA-YJP, 
and NSA-OA (Populus tremuloides Michx.).  This information will also be useful 
for modeling the vertical distribution of carbon fixation for different forest 
types in the boreal forest. 

1.4 Summary of Parameters

Light-saturated net photosynthesis, nitrogen concentration.

3. Theory of Measurements

During the process of photosynthesis, CO2 is assimilated by the green leaves 
while H2O is released into the atmosphere. The amount of water released and the 
amount of CO2 absorbed are determined by comparing the concentrations of water 
vapor and CO2 in the air moving into the leaf cuvette and those in  the air 
moving out of the cuvette at a certain flow rate. The concentration  of CO2 and 
water vapor in both incoming and outgoing air streams is measured using an 
infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). 

The total nitrogen concentration of foliage was determined by the Kjeldahl 
method. This consists of two main steps: (1) The nitrogen in the sample is 
converted to NH4+ by digestion with concentrated H2SO4 containing substances 
that promote this conversion. (2) The NH4+ is determined from the amount of NH3 
liberated by distillation of the digest with alkali.  This is a common procedure 
for total nitrogen determination for plant 
materials. 

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

4.1.1 Collection Environment

The vertical profile of the canopy was divided into three layers; top, middle, 
and bottom. For OBS, UBS, and OJP, all three layers were of the same species. 
For YJP, the bottom layer was the understory black spruce seedlings, while the 
top and middle layers were jack pine. For OA, the bottom layer was alder, while 
the top and middle layers were aspen. Branch samples were harvested from each 
layer and were immediately recut under water. The samples were then transported 
back to the laboratory for gas exchange measurements. The cut surface of the 
branch was submerged in water during transport and in the laboratory. 

Samples were cut in the dark. The samples that were about to be measured, 
however, were exposed to saturated light for 2 hours prior to measurement to 
induce stomatal opening and photosynthetic activity.  To keep a continual supply 
of water to the branch, the cut surface was kept in contact with water during 
the entire period. The light source was two 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium 
lamps. Different levels of light were achieved by using different neutral 
density filters. The environmental conditions inside the leaf cuvette were as 
follows: temperature 20 +/- 0.5 C; vapor pressure deficit 0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 
360  +/- 20 ppm.

Photosynthesis and related parameters all are expressed on a hemisurface
area basis. The shape factors for the leaf area calculation were 4 and 4.59,
respectively, for black spruce and jack pine.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Branch samples were taken using a shotgun and were recut under water.
Photosynthesis was measured in the laboratory under a controlled environment. 

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

1. To obtain the canopy profile of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen
concentration.

2. To examine interspecific and interseasonal differences in these 
canopy profiles. 

4.1.4 Key Variables

Rate of light-saturated net photosynthesis, foliar nitrogen concentration.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

A LI-COR-6262 IRGA, thermocouples, balance, Decagon AgVision root and leaf 
analysis system, and LI-COR quantum Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) 
sensor were used in the data collection process.

Eight samples were measured from each canopy level.  Two samples were measured 
at a time, and measurements were alternated between different canopy levels.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

All samples were taken from the upper third of the forest canopy.  Efforts were 
made to keep the amount of foliage relatively consistent from sample to sample.  
The leaf chamber for the measurement is about 1,300 in.

4.2 Calibration

The gas analyzer was calibrated against standard gas that was calibrated against 
the prime CO2 standard in the NSA lab in Thompson. Calibration was done at the 
beginning of each field campaign. 

4.2.1 Specifications

The weighing balance was accurate to within 0.0001 g.

The leaf area system was accurate to within 1%.

The gas exchange system was accurate to 1 ppm CO2.

The shape factor used for black spruce was 4, in accordance with the BOREAS 
Experiment Plan, Appendix K, Version 3.0. Based on observations of two cross-
sections of two needles per fascicle for five fascicles for six jack pine trees 
from Thompson, Manitoba, an average shape factor of 4.59 (+/- 0.07) was 
calculated.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

No tolerance level was set for these measurements.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

LI-COR 6262 IRGA was calibrated at the beginning of each IFC.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

None.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

The vertical profile of the canopy was divided into three layers: top, middle, 
and bottom. For OBS, UBS, and OJP, all three layers were of the same species. 
For YJP, the bottom layer was the understory black spruce seedlings,while the 
top and middle layers were jack pine. For OA, the bottom-layer was alder, while 
the top and middle layers were aspen. Branch sampleswere harvested from each 
layer and were immediately recut under water.  The samples were then transported 
back to the laboratory for gas exchange measurements. The cut surface of the 
branch was submerged in water during

entire period. The light source was two 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps. 
Different levels of light were achieved by using different neutral density 
filters. The environmental conditions inside the leaf cuvette were as follows: 
temperature 20 +/- 0.5 8C; vapor pressure deficit 0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 360 +/- 
20 ppm.

Photosynthesis and related parameters all are expressed on a hemisurface area 
basis. The shape factors for the leaf area calculation were 4 and 4.59, 
respectively, for black spruce and jack pine.
