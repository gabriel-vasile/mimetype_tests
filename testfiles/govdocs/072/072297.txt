1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-09 NSA Photosynthetic Response Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The response of photosynthesis to ambient CO2 concentration, temperature, light 
(Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), vapor pressure difference, and shoot 
water potential was investigated as part of an effort to construct the response 
surfaces of photosynthesis to different environmental factors.  Samples were 
taken from three forest types:  jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), black spruce 
(Picea mariana Mill. B.S.J.P), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the 
BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Northern Study Area (NSA) during each 
of the three Intensive Field Campaigns (IFCs) in 1994.  

Measurements were taken under controlled environmental conditions in the 
laboratory using an open gas exchange system in differential mode. 

Photosynthesis and related parameters all are expressed on a hemisurface area 
basis.  The shape factors for leaf area calculation are 4 and 4.59, 
respectively, for black spruce and jack pine.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

This data set was collected and prepared to provide the response curves of 
photosynthesis to (1)  ambient and intercellular CO2 concentration, (2) 
temperature, and (3) PAR in jack pine, black spruce, and aspen in the NSA using 
a cut-branch technique.

Additional data sets were collected and prepared to provide the response curves 
of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to water vapor pressure difference 
for jack pine and black spruce to provide the response of photosynthesis to 
shoot water potential in jack pine and black spruce in the NSA.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

Net photosynthesis, ambient and intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration, 
stomatal conductance, temperature, PAR, vapor pressure difference (VPD), water 
potential.

1.5 Discussion

The response of photosynthesis to ambient CO2 concentration, temperature, and 
light (PAR), the response of stomatal conductance to VPD; and the response of 
photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to shoot water potential were 
investigated as part of an effort to construct the response surfaces of 
photosynthesis to different environmental factors.  Samples were taken in the 
NSA during each of the three IFCs in 1994 from three forest types: old jack pine 
(OJP), old black spruce (OBS), and old aspen (OA).  

Measurements were taken under controlled environmental conditions in the 
laboratory using an open gas exchange system in differential mode. 

Photosynthesis and related parameters all are expressed on a hemisurface area 
basis.  The shape factors for leaf area calculation are 4 and 4.59, 
respectively, for black spruce and jack pine.

3. Theory of Measurements

During the process of photosynthesis, CO2 is assimilated by green leaves 
(photosynthesis) while H2O is released into the atmosphere (transpiration).  The 
amount of water released and the amount of CO2 absorbed can be determined by 
comparing the concentrations of watervapor and CO2 in the air moving into the 
leaf cuvette and those in the air moving out of the cuvette at a known flow 
rate.  The concentrations of CO2 and watervapor in both incoming and outgoing 
air streams can be measured using an infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA).   The rates 
of net photosynthesis and transpiration are calculated from the difference in 
the concentrations of CO2 and water vapor between the input and the output from 
the leaf cuvette.  Stomatal conductance is calculated from transpiration rate 
and the water vapor gradient between the intercellular space and the bulk air in 
the cuvette.

The water in the xylem is under tension.  When the stem of the branch is cut, 
the water will retreat from the cut surface.  When the cut-branch is enclosed in 
the pressure chamber with the cut surface extruding and pressurized gradually, 
the xylem water will come back to the cut surface when the pressure is equal to 
the water potential of the shoot.   The pressure inside the pressure chamber, 
and thus the water potential of the shoot, can be read  from a pressure gauge.

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

LI-COR 6262IRGA, thermocouples, balance, Decagon 
AgVision root and leaf analysis system, PMS Model 610 pressure chamber. 

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Values of major environmental variables are given in the data set for each 
individual measurement.

Upper-canopy branch samples were harvested using a shotgun and were immediately 
recut under water. The samples were then transported to the laboratory for gas 
exchange measurement.  The cut surfaces of the branches were submerged in water 
during transport (30 to 50 min) and in the laboratory.  Measurements for each 
species generally took 6 to 10 hours.

All samples were kept in the dark but prior to measurement, samples were exposed 
to saturated light for 2 hours to induce stomatal opening and photosynthetic 
activity. To test photosynthetic response to CO2 concentration changes, steady-
state readings were taken at each CO2 level. An independent set of two samples 
was used for each two CO2 levels.  Ambient CO2 varied from 50 to 900 ppm.

To keep a continued supply of water to the branch, the cut surface was kept in 
contact with water during the entire course of measurement.   Saturated light 
was supplied using two 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps.   When ambient CO2 
was varied, other environmental conditions were as follows: temperature = 20 +/- 
0.58 C; VPD = 0.7 +/- 0.1  kPa; CO2 = 360 +/- 20 ppm.

To test photosynthetic response of varied temperature, the air temperature 
inside the leaf cuvette was controlled using a radiator that was driven by a 
temperature-controlled water bath.  The vapor pressure inside the cuvette was 
controlled by passing watervapor saturated air through a condenser whose 
temperature was controlled using another water bath.

A independent set of two branches was used for each temperature.  The branches 
were from four different trees and were mixed randomly. 

Saturated light for the measurement was supplied using two 1,000-watt high- 
pressure sodium lamps. VPD of the air was controlled at a relatively constant 
level except at temperatures below 108 C, when there were some technical 
difficulties in getting a low enough vapor pressure to maintain the desired VPD. 
Input CO2 concentration was controlled at 360 (+/- 15 ppm). 

To test photosynthetic response of varied PAR, the measurements started  from 
the highest PAR level and proceeded to darkness.  Steady-state readings were 
taken at each light level. The light source was  two 1,000-watt high-pressure 
sodium lamps.  Different levels of light were achieved  by using different 
neutral density filters.  The environmental conditions inside the leaf cuvette 
were as follows:  temperature  20 +/- 0.58 C; VPD 0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 360 +/- 
15 ppm.

To test stomatal conductance of varied VPD, all samples were kept in the dark.  
The samples to be measured, however, were exposed to saturated light for 2 hours 
prior to measurement to induce stomatal opening and photosynthetic activity.  

The stability and reliability of the cut-branch technique were tested.  Stable 
measurements for at least 24 hours are possible.  Steady-state readings were 
taken at  each VPD level. 

An independent set of two samples was used for each VPD level. To keep a 
continued supply of water to the branch, the cut surface was kept in contact 
with water during the entire course of measurement.

Different VPD levels were achieved by regulating the water vapor pressure of the 
input air stream to the leaf cuvette.  Saturated light was supplied using two 
1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps.  The CO2 concentration in the input air 
was 360 (+/- 15 ppm).  Measurements were taken at three temperatures (15, 25, 
and 358 C) in IFC-1, two temperatures (25, and 358 C) in IFC-2, and at 258 C 
only in IFC-3.

In the laboratory, the branches were taken out of the water, the cut surfaces of 
the branches were dried and sealed using silicon grease.  The branches were then 
exposed to light and let transpire freely.  At certain time intervals, the gas 
exchange of  the branches (two at a time) was measured.  The water potential of 
the branches was measured immediately after the gas exchange measurement.

Gas exchange was measured at saturated light conditions.   Other environmental 
conditions in the leaf cuvette were as follows: temperature 20  +/- 0.58 C;  VPD 
0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 of input air 360 +/-15 ppm.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Branch samples were harvested in the early morning using a shotgun and 
transported to the laboratory in Thompson for gas exchange measurement. 

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

1. To obtain the response curves of photosynthesis to ambient and intercellular 
CO2 concentration, temperature, PAR, leaf-to-airVPD, and shoot water potential.                                     

2. To examine interspecific differences in photosynthetic response to CO2, 
temperature, PAR, leaf-to-air VPD and shoot water potential.

3. To examine seasonal variations in photosynthetic response to CO2, 
temperature, PAR, leaf-to-air VPD, and shoot water potential.


4.1.4 Key Variables

Net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, ambient and 
intercellular CO2 concentration, temperature,PAR flux density, VPD, water 
potential.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The stems of samples were connected to a water reservoir during the measurement 
to keep a continuous supply of water to the foliage.  Independent samples were 
used for each temperature level and each sample was measured for two CO2 levels.  
Samples were exposed to saturated light for 2 hours prior to measurement to 
induce photosynthetic activity and stomatal opening.

Upper-canopy branch samples were harvested using a shotgun and were immediately 
recut under water. The samples were then transported to the laboratory for gas 
exchange measurement.  The cut surfaces of the branches were submerged in water 
during transportation (30 to 50 min).

In the laboratory, the branches were taken out of the water and the cut surfaces 
were dried and sealed using silicon grease.  The branches were then exposed to 
light and let transpire freely.  At certain time intervals, the gas exchange of  
the branches (two at a time) was measured.  The water potential of the branches 
was measured immediately after the gas exchange measurement.

Gas exchange was measured at saturated light conditions.   Other environmental 
conditions in the leaf cuvette were as follows: temperature 20  +/- 0.58 C; VPD 
0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 of input air 360 +/-15 ppm.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

All samples were taken from the upper third of the forest canopy.  Efforts were 
made to keep the amount of foliage relatively consistent from sample to sample.  
The leaf chamber for the measurement is about 1,300 c in3.

4.2 Calibration

The LI-COR 6262 gas analyzer was calibrated using a standard gas at the 
beginning of each field campaign.  The standard gas had been calibrated against 
the prime CO2 standard in the NSA laboratory in Thompson, Manitoba, using gas 
chromatography technique.  The stability of gas exchange and the reliability of 
the cut branch technique were also tested (see Dang et al., 1997a, for details).

4.2.1 Specifications

The weighing balance was accurate to within 0.0001 g.

The leaf area system was accurate to within 1%.

The gas exchange system was accurate to 1 ppm CO2.

The shape factor used for black spruce was 4, in accordance with the BOREAS 
Experiment Plan, Appendix K, Version 3.0. Based on observations of two cross- 
sections of two needles per fascicle for five fascicles for six jack pine trees 
from Thompson, Manitoba, an average shape factor of 4.59 (+/- 0.07) was 
calculated.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

No tolerance level was set for these measurements.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

The LI-COR 6262 IRGA was calibrated at the beginning of each IFC.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

Calibrations were performed according to each manufacturer's instructions.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Upper-canopy branch samples were harvested using a shotgun and were immediately 
recut under water. The samples were then transported to the laboratory for gas 
exchange measurement.  The cut surfaces of the branches were submerged in water 
during transport (30 to 50 min) and in the laboratory.  Measurements for each 
species generally took 6 to 10 hours.

CO2 concentration variation

All samples were kept in the dark, but prior to measurement, samples were 
exposed to saturated light for 2 hours to induce stomatal opening and 
photosynthetic activity. Steady-state readings were taken at each CO2 level and 
an independent set of two samples was used for each two CO2 levels.  Ambient CO2 
varied from 50 to 900 ppm.

To keep a continued supply of water to the branch, the cut surface was kept in 
contact with water during the entire course of measurement.   Saturated light 
was supplied using two 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps.   Other 
environmental conditions were as follows: temperature = 20 +/- 0.58 C; VPD = 0.7 
+/- 0.1  kPa; CO2 = 360 +/- 20 ppm.

Temperature variation:

The air temperature inside the leaf cuvette was controlled using a radiator that 
was driven by a temperature-controlled water bath.  The vapor pressure inside 
the cuvette was controlled by passing water vapor-saturated air through a 
condenser whose temperature was controlled using another water bath.

Saturated light for the measurement was supplied using two 1,000-watt high-
pressure sodium lamps. VPD of the air was controlled at a relatively constant 
level except at temperatures below 108 C, when there were some technical 
difficulties in getting a low enough vapor pressure to maintain the desired VPD. 
Input CO2 concentration was controlled at 360 (+/- 15 ppm). 

An independent set of two branches was used for each temperature.  The branches 
were from four different trees and were mixed randomly. 

PAR variations:

The measurements started from the highest PAR level and proceeded to darkness.  
Steady-state readings were taken at each light level. The light source was two 
1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps.  Different levels of light were achieved  
by using different neutral density filters.  The environmental conditions inside 
the leaf cuvette were as follows: temperature  20 +/- 0.58 C; VPD 0.7 +/- 0.2 
kPa; CO2 360 +/- 15 ppm.

Vapor pressure variation:

All samples were kept in dark but prior to measurement, samples were exposed to 
saturated light for 2 hours to induce stomatal opening and photosynthetic 
activity. The stability and reliability of the cut-branch technique were tested.   
Stable measurements for at least 24 hours are possible.  Steady-state readings 
were taken at each VPD level. 

An independent set of two samples was used for each VPD level. To keep a 
continued supply of water to the branch, the cut surface was kept in contact 
with water during the entire course of measurement.

Different VPD levels were achieved by regulating the water vapor pressure of the 
input air stream to the leaf cuvette.  Saturated light was supplied using two 
1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamps.  The CO2 concentration in the input air 
was 360 (+/- 15 ppm).  Measurements were taken at three temperatures (15, 25, 
and 358 C) in IFC-1, two temperatures (25 and 358 C) in IFC-2, and at 258 C only 
in IFC-3.

Shoot water potential variations:

In the laboratory, the branches were taken out of the water and the cut surfaces 
were dried and sealed using silicon grease.  The branches were then exposed to 
light and let transpire freely.  At certain time intervals, the gas exchange of  
the branches (two at a time) was measured.  The water potential of the branches 
was measured immediately after the gas exchange measurement.

Gas exchange was measured at saturated light conditions.   Other environmental 
conditions in the leaf cuvette were as follows: temperature 20  +/- 0.58 C VPD  
0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO2 of input air 360 +/-15 ppm.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

During photosynthetic response to temperature differences, condensation 
sometimes formed on the radiator inside the cuvette when the temperature went 
below 108 C.

Possible genetic differences between trees and possible differences in 
physiological conditions between branches could cause inconsisencies in the 
data.

There are no other known sources of error.

10.2 Quality Assessment

Please contact Dr. Hank Margolis and Dr. Qinglai Dang if these data are used for 
publication.   (See Section 2.3 Contact Information).

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

After each measurement, the sample was removed from the leaf cuvette and a base 
measurement (i.e., when cuvette contains no sample) was taken. The previous 
measurement was adjusted by this base value, if necessary.

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

No statistical confidence level is yet available.  However, the investigators 
are very confident that these data are reliable.  Results are consistent with 
field measurements.
