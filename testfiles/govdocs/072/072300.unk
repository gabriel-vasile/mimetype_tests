     In many developing countries, agriculture and forestry have yet to coexist sustainably. The world's remaining
     forested lands continue to dwindle under pressures of growing populations and their need for land to farm and
     for fuelwood and construction material. With the help of USAID some developing countries are finding that land
     cleared for cultivation or pasture can be equally or more profitable and better preserved if planted again in
     trees. In increasing numbers, developing-country farmers and ranchers are returning a share of the lands to
     trees. In return, they are gaining both economic and environmental dividends. Farm forestry has emerged both
     as a source of commercial timber and fuelwood and as a means for reducing the pressures on remaining
     natural forests for tree products.


The Problem

     Runaway deforestation, particularly the
destruction of tropical forests, is resulting in
the loss of watersheds, wildlife habitats, and
recreational areas in developing countries.
Developing-country governments have few
resources to undertake reforestation and to
manage remaining natural forests, despite
increasing demands of their growing
populations for forest services and products.
Much land that was once forested has been
converted to private ownership and is used for
agriculture or livestock grazing. A share of
this farmland is too fragile to sustain
cultivation and is rapidly eroding.


The Win Win Solution

     A recent USAID evaluation has identified
private farm forestry, by small and large
landowners alike, to be a promising
arrangement for getting trees back into the
ground and for reducing pressures on
remaining natural forests. (See Synthesis
Report Forestry and the Environment: An As-
sessment of USAID Support for Farm and
Community Forestry, September 1995).
Although the number of experiments with
farm forestry are limited, preliminary findings
suggest the approach warrants consideration
as a useful tool for fostering environmentally
sustainable development in a range of
developing-country settings.
     
     The clouds of declining global forest cover
have a silver lining in the growing scarcity and
rising value of timber products. Trees are
becoming more valuable as a renewable cash
crop than as a depletable resource. In
developing countries with supportive
economic and regulatory policies, a growing
share of forest products is coming from trees
planted on farmland. The climate of the tropics
and subtropics enables farmers to harvest a
"crop" of trees within a few years after putting
seedlings in the ground. Tree cuttings for
fodder and fencing can come sooner. In 8 to
10 years, trees are large enough for
construction timber used in rural houses.

     Commercial tree seedling nurseries and
custom planting and harvesting enterprises
have sprung up to support farm forestry. These
ventures are easily undertaken by small
entrepreneurs with limited capital. Women are
important participants and income-earners in
seedling cultivation and tree planting. In addi-
tion, farm forestry has demonstrated the
capacity to produce environmental dividends-
 stabilizing hillsides, restoring waterlogged
and saline soils, and providing watersheds and
wildlife habitats.


The Role of USAID

     USAID projects have fostered farm
forestry as a strategy for restoring tree cover
on fragile farmlands and for increasing the pri-
vate supply of timber products as an
alternative to cutting down natural forests.
Many of these projects have aimed at meeting
the growing demand for fuelwood from
commercially grown trees rather than from
remaining natural forests.

     In Pakistan a USAID forestry project
introduced farm forestry to meet increased
demand for fuelwood, the principle source of
energy for rural households. As a result, a new
farm-based timber products industry has been
spawned. Tree nurseries supply tens of
millions of seedlings annually to a growing
number of cultivators seeking to put the most
marginal areas of their farmlands into cash-earning tree production. A new forestry
extension training curriculum, recently
graduated tree production agents, and a new
government's social forestry wing support
these ventures. 

     In Costa Rica the Agency helped launch
a program to encourage commercial plan-
tations of native tree species on lands that had
been cleared of forest for pasture. Working
with landowners willing and able to make the
investments and assume the risks, a regional
environmental nongovernmental organization
(NGO) is monitoring the performance under
plantation management of eight species of
native trees with promising production and
timber market value.

     In the Philippines, government and NGO
extension workers have introduced and
adopted an agroforestry system for hillside
farmers. The system both stabilizes the soil
and captures enough moisture to allow crop
cultivation in rain-fed conditions. It system
involves planting cash crops in alleys between
rows of leguminous trees along contoured hill-
sides. It has been picked up and applied in
Nepal and Sri Lanka.
 
     Farm forestry may hold particular promise
in countries where wood for fuel, construction,
and other uses is in short supply. Specifically,
USAID, other donors, NGOs, and developing
country governments can work together to

     þ    Identify, design, and develop farm
          forestry projects

     þ    Introduce economic and land and
          tree tenure policies that promote
          farm forestry and the marketing and
          trade of forest products

     þ    Promote private investments in tree
          seedling nurseries and custom tree
          planting and harvesting services

     þ    Provide technical and financial sup-
          port to training, recruiting, and
          curriculum reform for forestry exten-
          sion activities 

     þ    Encourage local commercial funding
          sources to cover the financial
          requirements of establishing farm
          forestry enterprises

þ    Fund research into farm forestry tech-
     nologies and wood products markets, and
     aid networking and exchange of
     information among forestry extension
     agents and researchers


Outstanding Issues

     Regulation and control. In some countries
farmers fear that in planting trees they lose
control of their land since permits are required
by government bureaucracies before the trees
can be cut or harvested. Public forestry
services have traditionally viewed their role
as policing public forestlands, not working as
partners to promote tree planting on private
farms. Government foresters must evolve from
enforcers to extension agents.

     Financial constraints. Tree farming is a
long-term commitment that requires up-front
investment of land, labor, and some capital for
planting and tree management. Without
arrangements for quick income, many
farmers particularly poor farmers on
marginal lands where trees might be
particularly suitable environmentally  might
be unable to participate. Tree nurseries are one
mechanism that can generate some immediate
income. Other arrangements may also be
required if farm forestry is to spread.

     Technical support. Like any other crop
production activity, farm forestry requires
know-how, capital investment, and quality
planting materials. Government agencies can
play a role in providing credit, extension
advice, and, seed for seedling production. Still,
promotion of tree farming has no institutional
home in some government settings. Trees fall
outside the responsibility of agriculture
ministries, and forest departments are
mandated to protect public forests, not provide
extension and seed to commercial farmers.
Banks often have no lending programs for tree
cultivation and are reluctant to lend for the
medium- to long- term periods required for
establishing and managing tree plantations till
harvest.

     Tree species performance. A number of
critical questions remain to be answered about
the performance of many tree species when
planted commercially and about their
environmental impact. Species such as
eucalyptus have been criticized for lowering
water tables in areas where moisture is in short
supply but praised for their contribution to im-
proved growing conditions in waterlogged
areas. Some native tree species introduced to
farmers have yet to be studied to determine
their growth performance and their disease and
pest resistance when grown in block planta-
tions. Markets for timber products from these
trees are also not well defined. Farmers
encouraged to cultivate these species are as-
suming production and marketing risks. The
risks are acceptable, perhaps, for larger land-
owners but probably too high for smaller
cultivators.
