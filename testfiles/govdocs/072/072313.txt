Does anyone have a working version of a Zilog z85230 ESCC serial device
driver? I have an old version (1993) of one from Wind River, but it was
given to us untested, and I am having a lot of trouble getting it working.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Martin -

You may be SOL. I suspect that the best you can do is order the items
in your struct from largest to smallest and hope that the compiler will
order them the same way. The struct itself will probably be the same
size, but the padding might be at the end rather than in the middle.

To see exactly what the compiler DID do, compile the source file that
defines the struct to assembly language instead of object and see what
the compiler really did give you. See your gnu manual for the switch,
I think it's "-s".

Good Luck! - Glenn

We padded our structures out to 32 bits because we are passing data 
through sockets to a labview application on a Win '95 PC.  Just group 
your short ints together, bits, etc. and add the appropriate pad to make 
it a full word boundary.  This way the structure definitions on both 
machines is identical, you don't have to figure out what the compiler is 
doing.  In your example you would have:

What about using bit fields?  You will still have padding, but it will
be at the end.  You will have to play games with type conversions
though.

typedef struct {
   unsigned
      shortVal : 16,
      longVal : 32;
} myStruct;

myStruct
   aStruct;

short
   aShort;

float
   aFloat;

   aStruct.shortVal = aShort;
   aStruct.longVal = *((unsigned *) &aFloat);

This should work.  You can then write the necessary number of bytes
starting at the beginning of the structure.
(I could not get it to work under Visual C++, but I am sure it is due to
some MS setting.  Check your compiler for specifics on bit fields.)

The GNU compiler has an extension which allows you to specify that a
certain structure field should be byte-aligned.  Define your structure like
this:

typedef struct mystruct
{
  short test;
  float ftest __attribute__ ((packed));
} mystruct;

You should find that sizeof(mystruct) returns 6 in this case.  Of course,
__attribute__ ((packed)) is not ANSI-compliant-- you might want to do
#define PACKED __attribute__ ((packed)) in a .h file and define your
structure this way:

typedef struct mystruct
{
  short test;
  float ftest PACKED;
} mystruct;

That way if you change compilers you could redefine PACKED.

When Tornado 1.0.1 came with the gnu 2.7.2 compiler I was
hoping to be able to do some tests of the exception support.

(Unfortunately the exception support was rejected by WindRiver
so any user wanting to try it has to do it on his own.)

We are using the cpu32 (68k) compiler for VxWorks 5.3.

The shipped compiler includes the support for exception
compilation using "-fhandle-exceptions" and "-frtti", and, it
compiles c++ code with exception handling without any
complaints.

But, when loading binaries compiled with exceptions I get
warnings on the following:

   warning: object module contains undefined symbols:
   ___register_exceptions, ___find_first_exception_table_match,
   ___unwind_function, _terminate__Fv

Anyone who knows how to get around this? What should/can
I rebuild in order resolve those symbols?

As I understand it use of exceptions under g++ 2.7.2
also precludes use of the -O option. Does anyone know
if there is any work underway at GNU to resolve this
problem? Does anyone know of any good articles on the
performance cost of placing C++ code inside a catch block?
I am interested only in the impact on the normal(no 
exception present) path through the C++ source code.

Subject: Uninitialized Interrupt 2
--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain

"Does anyone happen to know ....?"

We have written a driver for an mv2603 and mv3604 that uses a PMC card
generating PMC interrupts . The driver runs fine, but occasionally we
get the message "uninitialized interrupt 2" while the driver is running.
The driver never hangs and appears to be working correctly otherwise.
Is this a similar situation which occurred in the BSP back when the 1603
boards printed out "uninitialized interrupt 7" back in the earlier days?
If I remember, this was due to noisy interrupt lines.  The fix was to
simply add in a handler which simply returned.

Or is this a different type of problem?

Thanx for any Help.

  I saw nothing in the locale.h that support timezone, so I used the
environment variable method described above.

  I followed these examples and always set time_in_minutes_from_UTC to
be positive. 

For example:
GMT-1 means time_in_minutes_from_UTC = 60
GMT+1 means time_in_minutes_from_UTC = 12*60+1*60 = 780 (this keeps it
positive)

  This didn't respond like I thought it would and once I set
time_in_minutes_from_UTC to -60 for the GMT+1 Timezone everything worked
correctly. 
 Any ideas what my the manual states that time_in_minutes_from_UTC must
be positive?

 Thank you!

Subject: SM_MAX_TRIES set to 100, yet smObjShow reports 5001
--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

All,

  We're in the popular cycle of evaluating the current VME PowerPC offerings.

  The current problem is affecting multiple vendor's cards, so I'm
wondering if I am running into a more general VxWorks SM_NET and/or vxMP
issue.

  The smObjShow output (below) shows a bizarre number for the Maximum Tries
to Take Lock field, even though the various config.h files set this upper
limit to 100.  Similarly, the smNetShow output is showing a large number of
packet errors that may be attributed to this.

  I've been able to trace this number down to a consecutive number of
'false' return values from each vendor's sysBusTas routines.  That is, at
some point, the sysBusTas routine said it could not TAS the backplane 5001
times in a row.

  I'm discussing with the vendors what the BSP issues may or may not be.  I
thought I'd open it up and see if any general users may have already
seen/fixed this issue.  I have a hard time believing that my bus is *that*
heavily loaded when this condition occurs (although I have 6 to 8 CPUs on
the backplane at the time).

  We're on Tornado 1.0.1 with the Jumbo Patch 3.  We have many, many
INCLUDE_ options set, but I'm not convinced they relate to this problem
(i.e. INCLUDE_SCSI, INCLUDE_POSIX, etc).

  Comments?

Hi all,

I am using transparent file access with FTP to transfer files generated
on my x86 BSP embedded system (Tornado 1.0, VxWorks 5.3) to another
computer. This works fine most of the time but sooner or later there
seems to be a problem during data transmission to the FTP server and the
whole embedded system hangs. The task that is using the transparent FTP
file access has one of the lowest priorities in the system so something
strange is going on. This is an excerpt from the FTP server log:

16:01:02 Connection accepted from 147.11.72.100
16:01:02 Command "USER target" received
16:01:02 PASSword accepted
16:01:02 User target logged in
16:01:02 Command "TYPE I" received
16:01:02 TYPE set to I N
16:01:02 Command "CWD c:/pr/mm5" received
16:01:02 Command "PORT 147,11,72,100,4,69" received
16:01:02 Port set to 147.11.72.100 - 1093 (4,69)
16:01:02 Command "STOR as05_05.dat" received
16:01:02 STORe started on file as05_05.dat

- -> so far this is o.k. but here comes the error :

16:02:38 Transfer aborted                             -> (usually only
takes about a second)
16:02:38 Put file c:/pr/mm5/as05_05.dat unsuccessfully
16:02:38 QUIT or close. User target logged out

Any idea what the problem could be?

thanks in advance 
Martin

P.S.: Just had a couple of other errors during ftp transfer to the
embedded systems. The first time I got the following error message:
"Socket error 10054" and the second time the ftp server said "Received
data signal FD_Write on socket 6 which I can't find". Both times the
embedded system hung afterwards...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Anyone who can help,

I am tying to make a bootable application by using your
taskSpawn command.  The problem is, I don't wish to build it
into the vxworks image due to its large size.  Is it possible
to spawn a task that is outside the vxworks image, even though
it is being loaded PRIOR to the taskSpawn call as follows in
usrRoot():

usrRoot()
{
        .
        .
        .

#ifdef INCLUDE_USER_APPL
    /* Startup the user's application */

    USER_APPL_INIT;     /* must be a valid C statement or block */
#endif

    /* Load module containing hostinit() 
     */
    env_id = loadModule(fd_env, LOAD_ALL_SYMBOLS);

    taskSpawn ("HostInit", 100, 0, 20000, (FUNCPTR)
hostinit,                                                                                             
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);

}

I can declare the task as external, so the "C" file builds, but
the link fails with:

ld386 -X -N -e _sysInit -Ttext 00108000  \
    -o vxWorks dataSegPad.o vxWorks.tmp ctdt.o
vxWorks.tmp(.text+0x5a87): undefined reference to `hostinit'


I also tried to add the -r option to the vxworks makefile, but upon
loading the image, I received an error and nothing loaded.

Is there a solution to this problem, or do I have to build an
incredibly large vxworks image with everything linked ahead of
time?

Thanks in advance!

  Try using the select function to test for read/write or exception for
each FD in use, It may help you detect when your socket is closed.

Hello,

   I am running Tornado 1.0.1 on a Win95 host with a PPC 603e target
(a MVME 2600-2 board in a VME chassie).  I would like to be able to 
read/capture keyboard input.  In a DOS environment, I would use the functions
in <conio.h>, and, in a unix environment, I would use functions in <termios.h>
to set up the console so I could read the keyboard.  Does anyone know how I do
this in the VxWorks environment?

Thanks,
Jim

Hi Dan,

What you're trying to do is interesting but tricky; you have to
do a little more than what you're doing now. Starting a task involves
optionally loading the code in memory and then creating a task with
one function from that code. You can keep the code external and load it
into memory as you're doing but how do you know the function to start
the task with? Specifically, in your taskSpawn call:

    taskSpawn ("HostInit", 100, 0, 20000, (FUNCPTR)hostinit,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);

Where is the function hostinit()? It is in the code you load, so vxWorks
will know it's address at load time but does not know its address at
compile/link time. So the compiler flags it as an external function and
the linker barfs because it doesn't find it.

What you have to do is to find the address of the hostinit function
at runtime and then call taskSpawn with that address. The only way I can
think of is using the symLib to find the address.
Try this piece of code:

{
     FUNCTPTR	pFunc;

    env_id = loadModule(fd_env, LOAD_ALL_SYMBOLS);

    if (ERROR == (symFindByName(sysSymTbl, "hostinit",
                    &pFunc, &symbolType))) {
          /* handle function not found error */
    }

     taskSpawn ("HostInit", 100, 0, 20000, pFunc,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);
}

That should do the work for you. I haven't tested it out so I'd be
interested in knowing your results.

Oh, btw, check all errors. I will save you a lot of grief one day.

HTH

Keywords: x86 mmx coff a.out

I have a need to execute a fairly sizeable chunk of mmx code on a
vxworks hosted system.  My target is x86 and my host is windows nt.
I currently have compiled and tested this code using visual c++.
Is there a relatively straight-forward way to convert this code to
run on vxWorks.  The basic problem seems to be that there is no
coff support in the x86 tool set.  I have considered the following
alternatives:
	(1) create a custom version of objcopy that supports both a.out
	    and coff.  Any thoughts on how difficult this task would be?
            (BFD supports both formats).
	(2) Generate an assembly language file and assemble it with
	    NASM.
	(3) Rewriting the code in gas and using intel mmx macros.
Am I missing something obvious?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
The simpler the solution, the better. TIA

Yup, correct analysis.

Oh yeah, very often.

On the target side, we simply use a macro to convert the integers:

#define ConvertEndian(x) ((x&0xFF)<<24 | (x&0xFF00)<<8 | (x&0xFF000000)>>8 | (x&0xFF00000000)>>24)

I wrote this from memory, so double check my coding.

Yes, I have has some problems with TCP sockets under VxWorks. Overcame
our problems by enabling the TCP_KEEPALIVE option on our sockets and
messing with the timers that control the keepalive function. The
timers are initialized with the default values specified in
tcp_timer.h (TCPTV_KEEP_INIT, TCPTV_KEEP_IDLE, TCPTV_KEEPINTVL, and
TCPTV_KEEPCNT determine the defaults). These default values are
extremely long in duration. Rather than changing the values in
tcp_timer.h and recompiling the socket libraries I changed the global
variables tcp_keepinit, tcp_keepidle, tcp_keepintvl and tcp_keepcnt
(which are initialized with the values specified in tcp_timer.h).
Maybe this would help you.

Subject: Problems upgrading to Tornado
--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

vxWorkers:

I am upgrading some S/W from 5.2 to Tornado and I have run into some 
problems.  

The code seems to work fine under 5.2.  I took this same code and 
recompiled it with the compilers shipped with 5.3.1.  It compiles fine, 
loads fine, and seems to run fine--except, it doesn't handle interrupts 
anymore.  The device that generates the interrupts is a non-vxWorks device 
and shouldn't be effected by the upgrade.  I did stick a VMETRO bus 
analyser board in to verify this and sure enough, interrupts are being 
generated (as expected) ... my code just isn't handling them under Tornado.
This *exact* same code did handle them under 5.2!  Just to make sure, I 
switched back to my 5.2 PROMs, recompiled the code again ... and it still 
works under 5.2.

The only thing unusual that I am doing is that I built my 5.3 vxWorks with 
5.2 support using the following includes:

#define INCLUDE_LOADER          /* object module loading */ 
#define INCLUDE_NET_SYM_TBL     /* load symbol table from network */ 
#define INCLUDE_RLOGIN          /* remote login */ 
#define INCLUDE_SHELL           /* interactive c-expression interpreter */ 
#define INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES   /* show routines for system facilities*/ 
#define INCLUDE_SPY             /* spyLib for task monitoring */ 
#define INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT  /* execute start-up script */ 
#define INCLUDE_STAT_SYM_TBL    /* create user-readable error status */ 
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL         /* symbol table package */ 
#define INCLUDE_TELNET          /* telnet-style remote login */ 
#define INCLUDE_UNLOADER        /* object module unloading */ 
#define INCLUDE_DEBUG           /* native debugging */ 


Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks,

Matthew

Hello,

I did some basic timing performance tests on our VxWorks target
(Motorola 68360 25 Mhz).
These tests included semaphorecreate, delete, take, give and the
spawning of tasks...

In the VxW FAQ, I found figures in the order of a few, to a few hundred
MICROseconds... 
My tests resulted in much much faster performance figures (In the order
of picoseconds :-/
(e.g. to create 1000 Mutual Exclusion Semaphores : 15 nanoseconds...)

What am I doing wrong, or are the FAQ performance figures outdated (FAQ
tests were done on a mv167 25Mhz)?
I'm using POSIX 'clock_gettime()' method to do the timing...

Can anyone help me with this? I've put part of the program below.

Thnx,
Sam.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is part of the test program:

#include <vxWorks.h>
#include <timers.h>
#include <semLib.h>

SEM_ID SemPrio[1000];

void semTakeTiming( void )
{
    int s;
    struct timespec start, end;

    printf("** Timing of Semaphore TAKE **\n\n");

    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &start);
    for(s=0 ; s<1000 ; s++){
      semTake( SemPrio[s], WAIT_FOREVER);
    }
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &end);
    printf("Delay to TAKE 1000 Mutual Exclusion Semaphores (Priority 		
Queueing) : %ld nsecs\n", end.tv_nsec - start.tv_nsec);
}

Reply-To: Thomas.Eriksson@lu.erisoft.se

Need a "Power Off" function on a
SPARC CPU-5V  ( in a Teraforce/Target-32 rack ) 
with Tornado 1.0.1 and
BSP CPU-5V/-5VT/-7V/-8VT Rel. 1.1/3   

Got this information:
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The software controlled down logic works as follows:

The power down program starts a write access to the VME
address $FCFFFFFE Hex. The specially designed decoding
logic on the MOTH-32 responds with the DTACK signal on
the VMEbus and this signal remains low. After this
action, the logic generates the shutdown signal to the
power supply. After detecting the shutdown signal, the
power supply powers off the DC voltage.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need an example for it, or more information.

Have anyone done this or seen it somewhere ?

Thanks   /  TE

Sam,

I do not see semCreate in your source. If this is really missing all your
semaphores are uninitialised.

Hello,

We are using an mv-2603 board and Tornado 1.01.

Does anyone have any experience writing to a PMC card ?

Im curious what kind of data rates you have seen writing
from CPU DRAM to PMC space.

How does one achieve the 132Mbyte / second figure ?


Thanks.

Mike,


What do you mean by "Ram Disks Don't work", we have been using a 2meg
ram disk in our system for quite some time, we use it as a place to
FTP a file when we update the FLASH memory.

We have not had problems with the Ram Disk, yet...


So, Id like to hear what problems you have had, to
know what to look for.


Thanks.




Mike.

Subject: Re:  VxWorks Timing
Sam,

I'm not sure what your clock source on a 68360 is, but, typically, the POSIX timing routines use the
resolution of the system clock, which is, by default, 16.67 ms (60 Hz).  That being the case, it
would be impossible to get a smaller delta time than 16.67 ms.

If you want to get finer resolution with your timings, you will need to use the timestamp clock.  I
don't know whether this is available by default with the BSP for your board.  If it is, and assuming
your timestamp clock runs as fast as the processor clock (which is doubtful), your tick resolution
will be 40 ns.

I don't see anything wrong with your code, assuming you are initializing your semaphores
elsewhere.  You might want to make a call to clock_getres() to determine the resolution of the
POSIX clock.  I think I can say with great certainty, however, that Wind River currently supports no
processor that can complete 1000 calls to semTake in 15 ns.

Subject: 486 RAM disk

--------------17BDB2E9551636B996C8994B
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi.
  I am starting a new project using a I486 system.  I need to use a RAM
disk.
I was able to set up the RAM disk but I am not sure how to access it.

Here is the code I used to create the RAM disk:
STATUS setramdrive(int size)
{
 BLK_DEV   *pBlkDev;
 DOS_VOL_DESC *pVolDesc;

 if(size == 0)
  size = 512;

 pBlkDev = ramDevCreate(0,size,400,400,0) ;

 if( pBlkDev == NULL )
 {
  printf("Creation of RAM Drive failed\n");
  return(ERROR);
 }

 pVolDesc = dosFsMkfs("DEV1:", pBlkDev );
 if( pVolDesc == NULL )
 {
  printf("Creation of RAM Drive File System failed\n");
  return(ERROR);
 }

 printf("Creation of RAM disk complete!\n");
 return (OK);
}

This works fine because I can see the device when I issue the "devs"
command from the shell.

However, I cannot access it.
How do I access this drive?

Thanks.
Jim Bucciferro

You can force the shell to give the command to the target by typing 
@command e.g. @ls

It just depends on how you configured your BSP. I think it s 
INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES.

Subject: scsiLib interface for scsi adapter driver???
--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

VxWorks Gurus,

I'm writing a driver for a scsi host bus vme adapter card. This scsi
initiator board has some board specific functionality for acquiring
status/identification data. It also has scsi command "pass through"
capability for interfacing to disk arrays. I'm trying to find out how to
interface to the scsi library in order to do scsi transactions under the
"pass through" functionality of the adapter board. I need some help with
the scsiLib's data structures in order to use them correctly in my
xxScsiTransact() function. I've talked to Tech Support (Vinh Du - TSR
#47581) at Wind River and they sent me some top level info from the
device driver training notes. This info was somewhat vague and
generalized. I asked Vinh Du if there were any source code templates or
example code for writing this type of driver. He responded that there is
but it is not available to me - WindRiver proprietary. Does anyone have
any sample code or even template code for this type of driver? If not,
does anyone know the details of the scsiLib data structure interface.

Thanks,
David

You will be able to access it programatically.  You cannot access it from
the WindShell command line.  Tornado intercepts all file system related
commands and executes some of them on the development host.  The last time
I tried it, Tornado could not tell that RAM disk commands had to be
executed on the target.

Hi,

I am guessing, that you can't read or write files.

I ran into the same problem and I had to start the dos filesystem.

Hope that helps.

We use a Ram disk on a PowerPC (mv2603) and we access it from the Windshell
as follows.

@cd "/ramdisk/"

@ls


Here is how you do it, this comes from a TSR that I had with WRS,
this is a "workaround" that we have found to work very well in our
application.


Include the following at the end of usrConfig.c

#ifdef INCLUDE_USRLIB

#include "usrLib.h"

/***************************************************************************
****
*
* usrLibInit - pull in usrLib.o finctions
*
* This dummy routine references cd () in usrLib.c so that all usrLib
* functions can be pulled into vxWorks.
*/

void usrLibInit (void)

{
cd (""); /* never actually called */
}

#endif /* INCLUDE_USRLIB */


Now define INCLUDE_USRLIB in config.h

This will allow you to do the following from windsh:

-> @ls "DISKA:"
-> @cd "DISKA:
-> @pwd
etc

The "@" sign is important, as it passes the command to the target instead
of interpreting it on the host side.

You can access it from WindShell, see my last message :-)

I have written several drivers for both the `old' (pre-Tornado) and current 
scsiLib interfaces, and I'm very familiar with what goes on in and around 
the data structures used by scsiLib and the drivers underneath it.

I can't supply any source code unless you purchase a source licence for 
scsiLib and/or a SCSI driver from WRS.  However, if you'd like to call or 
e-mail me with your queries I'd be happy to help.

BTW I will be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday next week.

Ian

Is it better to use the raw I/O, open(),creat(),read(),write() for a RAM
disk or can I use the stdio
functions - fopen(), fread(), fwrite()?

Consumers have been helpless to stop the harassment of these predators, UNTIL NOW!

Our hard-hitting report 'Stop Collection Agencies Cold (C 1996)' will show you how to put an end to those telephone calls and letters, INSTANTLY! At the same time, the collectors will be forbidden to EVER call or write you again!!

'Stop Collectors Cold (C 1996)' is a brief, concise report that will tell you everything you need to know to stop the harrassment forever and comes to you with a 100% money-back guarantee! This report is normally $49.95, but if you act WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, you will pay only $18.00 plus $1.95 S&H.

I don't think so either...
I attached the complete file with this mail... I did initialize the
semaphores, and I read the clock resolution too :
  (Clock resolution = 0 seconds  16666666 nanoseconds)

Is it ok to say then that the result I got was the number of
clock ticks...so when I multiply this by 16.67 msec
(= time/tick), I get the time it took (approximately of course)?

Thanks again for your help!

Sam.

Hello fellow VxWorkers,

The new application I am working on is to be written in C++ hosted on an HP 
workstation targeted for the 604e PowerPC.  I am currently evaluating Rational 
Rose/C++ and Apex.  Has anyone developed under this environment with Rational?  
If so, then can you address the pros and cons of using their tools.  If Rational
was not used, then can anyone recommend a set of tools that they did use.  I do 
not want to use the gnu tools that are supplied with VxWorks.


TIA,

Anyone kindly point me to a list of the linker error numbers?

We are using a 68060 target from a Sun host VxWorks 5.3. and I can't
find any reference to the error numbers in the WindRiver documentation
set and didn't particularly want to search the GNU sources (our
installation of info does not have the numbers).

My specific problem is that when I enable the -M map option I get a core
dump (about 15Mbytes) with a numeric error message part way through the
link. The output binary is something over 4Mbyte and compiles ok without
the -M option.

Maybe it's just too big ...

A couple of things:
  Did you do the NIOT command first in order to set up the server and
client IP addresses?  These do not come from the same place as the ones
used by VxWorks (apparently).
  Did you start up the system clock?  162's are shipped with the clock turned
off in order to save the battery, but you must start them in order for the
ethernet communication to work under 162bug.

I hope this helps,

--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I need to use FTP.  However, ftpXfer doesn't work for some remote
servers so I have to resort to using the lower level FTP commands.  I
got the current chain of commands from the VxWorks Manual but I'm not
sure if I need all of them.
Here is my code:

 int ctrlSock;
 int dataSock;
 int status = OK;
...

if( (ctrlSock = ftpHookup( server )) == ERROR )  {...}

 if( ftpLogin( ctrlSock, username, password,"") == ERROR ) {...}

 if( ftpCommand(ctrlSock, "TYPE I", 0,0,0,0,0,0 ) != FTP_COMPLETE )
{...}

 if( ( dataSock = ftpDataConnInit( ctrlSock )) == ERROR ) {...}

 if( ftpCommand( ctrlSock, "RETR %s/%s",serverpath, serverfile,0,0,0,0 )
!= FTP_PRELIM ) {...}

 if( (dataSock = ftpDataConnGet( dataSock )) == ERROR ) {...}
....
If all of these commands pass, then I retrieve the file and copy it to a
ram disk, which works fine.

The question is whether I need all of these commands, and is the order
correct.

Thanks.

No, You aren't. However, as You did not include very much information
(which versions do You use, how do You see the error), I only can guess
that it is the same error as occured here.

I had this problem with Tornado 1.0. In the meantime, I changed to
1.0.1, and everything is allright.

What experiences have people had with the 1.0,1.0.1 releases of 
Tornado on Win95 or NT hosts?

I am particularly interested in the host debugger, crosswind, which 
is giving us a lot of problems which WRS seem not to be able to give 
us solutions on at this time.

We run on NT 4.0 hosts to PC based targets, using ethernet connection 
between host and target. So far we have removed all of the anti virus 
software, rebuilt NT 4.0 from scratch and reinstalled from scratch 
the Tornado tools, oh and we got rid of all the NT 4.0 service packs 
as well. Still however we see lots of lock ups in the debugger.

I am interested to know if we are alone in this problem or not and 
solutions if anyone has been here and overcome it.

Thanks in advance

Tony

Subject: VME Interrupts on a 2604
Hi, fellow "VxWorkers"

I am having trouble connecting the VME interrupts to a 2604 based handler.
I have done this in both the 68k and 1604 PPC families (but both use the VMEchip2)
but in the Universe/Raven chipset, I am having a little trouble.

Could someone offer a code fragment to connect a VME generated interrupt to a 
handler on a 2604(3)??? (including any needed enabling)

I must be missing some crucial because the VMEbus analyser shows the IACK occurred,
but I never get the interrupt...

F.Y.I.

As it happens, the vxWorks exploder is manually maintained by a (sub?)human.

There are three ways to read postings to the exploder and news group:

    1) Subscribe to the immediate mailing list.  This will get the messages
       mailed to you "as they happen."  New subscribers are placed on this
       list by default.

    2) Subscribe to the digest.  This will get all of the messages that were
       posted to the list within the last 24 hours mailed to you each morning
       as one message.

    3) Read the news group "comp.os.vxworks".  This contains all of the
       messages that are sent to the mailing list as well as messages posted
       to the news group.  In addition, all messages posted to the news group
       are automagically mailed to the immediate mailing list subscribers once
       each day, and are included in the next edition of the digest.

Messages to the list should be either emailed to vxwexplo@lbl.gov or posted
to the "comp.os.vxworks" news group.  When responding to messages, please
minimize the quoted section of the original message.  Messages which contain
the "trailer" added by the exploder are deleted in an attempt to avoid
"storms" of bounce messages.

Requests for subscriptions, removal from the list, address changes, etc.
should be sent to "vxwexplo-request@lbl.gov".  While requests can be sent
to me directly, sending them to "vxwexplo-request@lbl.gov" insures that
someone will receive and deal with them when I am not available.  Please
be sure to include the address that you used when you subscribed and note
which list (immediate list or digest) you receive when requesting service.

DO NOT SEND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUESTS TO "vxwexplo@lbl.gov."  Since these
request are of little interest to the rest of the world, filters in the
exploder will send these messages to some file that we'll probably forget
to check.  The correct addresses for posting and for administrative matters
are appended to each message mailed by the exploder.

Also - PLEASE - when "bounce" messages start to appear on the list, DON'T
SEND COMPLAINTS TO THE WHOLE LIST!!!  That just makes things worse!  If you
must complain, send a message to me at "vxwexplo-request@lbl.gov".  While
it may not result in my fixing the problem any sooner, at least it will
not make things worse.

Several sites maintain their own "sub-exploders" which redistribute postings
within the supporting orginization.  We do not maintain these lists.

The WRS web-site URL is www.wrs.com

Information on the vxWorks archive is available by sending e-mail to

here is an example used on a 2603, the hardware doc for the board tells us
the vector

I've been in business for a long time.  While many businesses have good earnings potential, they are laden down with high costs of inventory, shrinking margins, risk factors, employees, overhead and marketing burdens...not to mention the owner's ball and chain..  I went on a search for two years to find the perfect HOME based business.  I finally found it!

We GIVE AWAY a wireless, two way state-of-the-art voice  technology home security system to homeowners and businesses.  The system is portable so it can be moved with the customer.  It is even available to renters.  NO other security company offers this option.  The customer signs a mandatory monitoring contract with a UL listed company at a competitive rate.  My compensation works similar to the cellular phone industry.  Each time I give away a system, I make at least $300.  Combine this with the ability to do network marketing, no risk, no employees, no overhead.... I've got a gold mine.

 We have code running under VxWorks 5.3 (x86) and I have just rebuilt
evrything for version 5.3.1. All is OK apart from the fact that the FTP
server will not let me log in. The documentation states that there is no
username or password checking but the error I get from the FTP client on the
host indicates that my password is invalid. Any ideas?

[Julian Day]  

FROM SPR 8602:

The reason is that Tornado 1.0.1 (VxWorks 5.3.1) is deliverd with an
ftpdLib.o compiled with INCLUDE_SECURITY enabled. Therefore the ftp deamon
always asks for a valid username and password.


RESOLUTION:

1. In target/config/all/configAll.h

   Place the following defines in the 'Included Software Facilities':

#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL (or INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2)
#define INCLUDE_SECURITY

   You can see the default user name ("target") and password ("password")
   under
 
#define LOGIN_USER_NAME ...
#define LOGIN_PASSWORD ...

2. The option INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2 will give a target shell, plus
   target-based tools, whereas INCLUDE_SYM_TBL simply includes the symbol
   table facilities.

   If you use the INCLUDE_SYM_TBL option, then you will need to make an
   additional change. In the file target/config/all/usrConfig.c, there is
   the following block of code:

    /* initialize interactive shell */

#ifdef  INCLUDE_SHELL
#ifdef  INCLUDE_SECURITY                      /* include shell security */
   if ((sysFlags & SYSFLG_NO_SECURITY) == 0)
      {
      loginInit ();                           /* initialize login table */
      shellLoginInstall (loginPrompt, NULL);  /* install security program */

      /* add additional users here as required */

      loginUserAdd (LOGIN_USER_NAME, LOGIN_PASSWORD);
   }
#endif  /* INCLUDE_SECURITY */
...

You need to copy the code bracketed by INCLUDE_SECURITY to a position
outside the INCLUDE_SHELL brackets.

...After a bit more looking around and suggestions from people here
is what I have come up with on my problem:

I figured out the hanging part can be corrected by also adjusting
the PCI to ISA interrupt routing as I suspected. These are hard-coded(!)
in the sysPciExtIbcInit() routine in sl82565IntrCtl.c:

    pciConfigOutWord (pciBusNo, pciDevNo, pciFuncNo, PCI_CFG_IBC_INTR_ROUTE,
                      0xabef);

I generalized this to the following and everything works:

    pciConfigOutWord (pciBusNo, pciDevNo, pciFuncNo, PCI_CFG_IBC_INTR_ROUTE,
                      (LN_INT_LVL << 12) |
                      (UNIV_INT_LVL <<  8) |
                      (SCSI_INT_LVL <<  4) |
                      0x000f );

The ISA interrupt lines do have an implicit priority, although what I'm after
is priorities along with actual interrupt nesting, and I'm not sure how/if
that's possible. Unfortuntately I was wrong about the priority order, as 
shipped the VxWorks assignments do make the Universe higher priority than
SCSI, although lower than the LAN. I have switched the universe to be higher
priority than the LAN, but with no obvious effect. I think the priority may
simply apply to simultaneous interrupts, not nested ones.

I've realized just what a hack the VxWorks mv2604 BSP is. Simple stuff like
the above should not need to be patched by users. The following comment 
says it all:

sl82565IntrCtl.c:
   INTERNAL
   ** HELP **
   The sysPciExtIbcInit function does not belong in this driver module.
   The excIntConnect function in sysIbcInit does not belong in this module.
   These should be removed and the change in initialization sequence should
   be updated.


No wonder there are so many problems...

You can redirect stdio to a windsh by placing the following in a windsh.tcl
file in your .wind dir:
                   if{[shParse {tstz = open ("/vio/0",2,0)}] !=-1} {
                       shParse {vf0 = tstz};
                       shParse {ioGlobalStdSet (0,vf0)};
                       shParse {ioGlobalStdSet (1,vf0)};
                       shParse {ioGlobalStdSet (2,vf0)};
                       shParse {logFdAdd (vf0) ;

Does anyone know why VxWorks is unable to send an ip packet to
255.255.255.255?

The broadcast address on my ethernet port (using ifShow) comes up as
net.255 where net is the network part of my class C address.  If I call
ifBroadcastSet() with 255.255.255.255, I get a -1 error.

I have an application (DHCP Server) that needs to send to the all 255
address and not the subnet broadcast.  I'm using VxWorks 5.3.

At runtime, dynamically download the object containing the flash code.
This will place the flash code in ram.  This assumes you have at least
a serial port.

I've figured out a way to resolve this.  Target symbol table
seems to be available to telnet (Windsh uses a symbol
table maintained by target server on the host.  So if
application image is loaded without going through tgt
svr, this host symbol table would not have the symbols).

Hi,

   Does the VxWorks 5.3 supports disconnect feature, i.e. in case I have
multiple tape drives attached to one MVME167, can I send data block
through SCSI bus to one tape drive, disconnect it and go to the next one
before it finishes?

I had to do exactly this and ended up by having the flash programming 
routines copy themselves on-demand (i.e. the first time they're called) 
into dynamically-allocated RAM and executing from there, with interrupts 
disabled.  Whether this satisfies the `semi-clean' criterion is debatable, 
but it works and does not require the flash programming code to be loaded 
at run-time.

Let me know if you want to see the code I used, George.

Does anyone have any experiences that they can share with regards to using
RPC on VxWorks?  Has anyone attempted to use RPC on VxWorks to talk to an
NT-based RPC client/server?  Is it possible to use the VxWorks NT-based
portmapper as a general purpose portmapper?
------------- End Included Message -------------

We have been using RPC on VxWorks for almost three years now. It works fairly 
well, allowing for its task-specific nature in Vx. We have had some problems 
with using TCP as the transport between two Vx hosts; WRS is aware of the 
problems and had a patch or two. But we just use the UDP transport and avoid the 
question.

We have not used an NT-based server with a Vx box over RPC, but have used SunOS 
and Windows 95 and 3.x. For the latter we used FTP Software's portmapper and RPC 
library.

Any more questions for me, let me know.

Subject: Basic VxWorks Ethernet Questions

Hello,

We are late in our project and now need to add a new, separate ethernet   
network to our system to connect our CPU board to a single subsystem.  We   
are using a Radstone CPU-46 with an MXES-1 daughter card in our VMEBUS   
target.  This configuration comes with ethernet on both boards with   
separate connections to the backplane.  However, they share hardware on   
the board.  Since I don't have the schematics, it is not clear exactly   
what is shared.  What we would like to do is to use the MXES ethernet   
(SN) for our download, shut this off, and then use the CPU-46 (SN) during   
execution.  WRS provides documentation for setting up many types of   
networks (SLIP, SM, etc.) but I haven't found anything that describes how   
I would configure a standard ethernet interface (SN) beyond them telling   
me to #INCLUDE_SN, or if VxWorks supports multiple ethernet connections   
of the same type from one VxWorks image.  Also, since the boot SN   
ethernet setup is done by VxWorks as a part of boot, how do I shut down,   
or close this connection?

Thanks for your help,

Joe B.

Seaweed Systems has a written-from-scratch memLib replacement. It
has all the functionality which Wind River's memLib has...and more!

It has memory leak detection, sanity checks at malloc/realloc/free
time, user-callable memory arena sanity checker, constant-time allocation,
better fragmentation behavior, callbacks for various low-memory
conditions, and more! A real ginzu knife of an app.

NobleNet sells ONC/RPC tools that support NT/95 and VxWorks platforms.
We support VxWorks Host environments: Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, ... , and
NT.  VxWorks Target environments: 68k, x86, Sparc, i960, alpha, mips.

Wind River Systems is our customer, and NobleNet is the supplier of the
ONC/RPC for the VxWorks NT Tornado environment.

NobleNet has also developed RPC server execution environment in VxWorks
that can launch server tasks on demand. This functionality can also
launch a server task per client.

The purchase of NobleNet RPC 3.0 allows redistribution of ONC/RPC DLL's
and portmapper executables for NT/95 without runtime fees. These
re-distributable components also include install tools which install
Portmapper as NT/Service or 95/Tray-Device to make your product
installation easy.

Hi,  I am new to VME as well as to VxWorks. 

I don't have the answer for this question, but I do have some related
questions. 

We have a MVME2604 board and a I/O board with dual port RAM 
which we need to map to CPU's VME A24 memory window. How am I supposed to it??

What is the difference in term of the purpose between mv2600.h
and confgi.h?

What is the difference between the Options: ???
config.h: VME_A24_MSTR_BUS
and
mv2600.h: VME_A24_MSTR_LOCAL

Any response is highly appreciated!!

Yipu

     Hi,
     
     Could someone be so kind to tell me how to attach a custom driver to 
     the TCP/IP stach in Tornado?  In Version 5.1 there is a function 
     "if_attach", but this function seems to disappear in 5.3.x.
     
     Your email response is greatly appreciated.
     
     Thank you very much in advance.

Subject: ioTaskStdSet( )
Hi, Folks,

Does ioTaskStdSet() act as a "tee" or should it move all I/O?
It my problem the fact I am running this thru windsh?

My ~/.wind/windsh.tcl contains:

        if { [shParse {tstz = open ("/vio/0",2,0)}] != -1 } {
              shParse {vf0 = tstz};
              shParse {ioTaskStdSet(0x17fc1a0, 0, vf0)};
              shParse {ioTaskStdSet(0x17fc1a0, 1, vf0)};
              shParse {ioTaskStdSet(0x17fc1a0, 2, vf0)};
              shParse {logFdAdd (vf0)};
              shParse {printf("Std I/O redirected for tLogTask\n")};
	}

where 0x17fc1a0 is the TID for tLogMsg...

Any help is greatly appreciated...

Question submitted by "Cunningham, John S (NM75)"   
<john.cunningham@das.honeywell.com>

As far as I have discovered you can not set some global initialization   
data for items like the
floating point registers in VxWorks. We ran in to a similar problem and   
had to add code for each
task to disable underflow and overflow errors. There is a couple of   
usefull functions and macros
defined in /h/arch/ppc/archPpc.h and /h/arch/ppc/vxPpcLib.h that   
simpifies the code writing.

John,

We ran into the same problem.  You can write your own floating-point initialization routine and
have it run at the creation of each new task by setting the fppCreateHookRtn global variable to that
routine.  Following is a short example of how you might do that:


#include "usrConfig.h"


LOCAL void usrFppCreateHook(FAST WIND_TCB *pTcb)
{

/*
**  Modify the the floating-point status and control register in the floating-
**  point context of the new task.
*/
    pTcb->pFpContext->fpcsr &= ~_PPC_FPSCR_UE;
}


void usrStartup(void)
{
    .
    .
    .
/*
**  Install a hook to modify the floating-point environment of all new tasks.
*/
    fppCreateHookRtn = (FUNCPTR)usrFppCreateHook;
    .
    .
    .
}

Hope this helps.

I am getting floating-point underflow errors on a MVME2603 target using
VxWorks.  I would like to disable the floating-point underflow error.
Will I have to manually edit code to write to the PC603e registers in my
>tasks to achive this or can I disable the underflow error in VxWorks?  Does
anyone know how I might do this in VxWorks?

Subject: Exception Handlers needed for CPU46

Hello out there,

I am looking for some generic exception handlers for use with the   
Radstone CPU-46 board that I could implement in place of the VxWorks   
exception handlers.  Specifically, the exception during an exception   
which causes the target to reboot.  In our application this would be   
utter (no, I do not work for Gateway) disaster, if it were ever to occur.   
 The other exception handler I need is for the less disasterous   
exceptions (bus error, etc) that causes VxWorks to suspend the offending   
Task.  Searching their literature has turned up what looks like a viable   
solution using setjmp/longjmp functions that need to be embedded into   
each of the Tasks.  Has anyone used this to try and keep things limping   
along after such a failure or is there a better way?

Thanks for the help.

Hey Guys,

The product I'm working on has the requirement to support multiple
telnet sessions.  TelnetLib, as provided by WRS, can not support
multiple telnetd sessions.

Has anyone gone through the process of modifying telnetLib to support
multiple sessions?

Any input would be greatly appreciated?

Thanks,

JDB

Georg,


We are using MPIC interrupts on a 2603 board, we have not had any
problems with Jumbo patch #2 installed, we are running 8000+ VME
interrupts / second, +Mouse, Keyboard, and SCSI and LAN interrupts.


When we installed Jumbo Patch #3, we couldn't run SCSI any more, so we
had to drop back to jumbo patch #2.

Other than that, we have been running the MPIC interrupts since early
Febuary (before they we included in the BSP), and we have been very
happy with the MPIC.


*** Don't blame the "604" lockups on the MPIC ***


Changing priority levels with the MPIC/RAVEN is very easy, and I would
reccomend changing it from the way it comes in the BSP, with
interrupts set to the same level.



Mike.

  Dear All,
  I am trying to program the flash memory of an mvme162, but I receive an
access fault every time it begins to write.
  Before starting to write to the flash, I read the address 0xfffcc000 to
a dummy variable which I hope gives me the write access to the flash, but
it does not. Is there another thing to do to provide a write access?
  I wonder if someone can find what I'm doing wrong or canv provide me
with a C routine that performs this.
  Thanks to all.

We've made changes to the "telnetLib" and "rlogLib" source code
to ensure we could have multple concurrent sessions.

The problem (Im sure you've figure out too) is the target-resident
vxWorks shell-paser which is NOT reentrant. Since the telnet session
brings up the shell, there could be only one session at a time.

We've modified the source code to "listen/accept" connections and
spawn a task associated with each connection that handshakes with
an "User Interface" task that has the menu options. In gist, we've
modified code to have a session-specific task be the server-side
Interface task (as opposed to the Shell). 

Feel freee to email me if you have any more questions.

Hi John,

We have a simple reentrant shell called "rshell" that ships with RTILib.  It
will support multiple connections, although you do it through a host terminal
program, not telnet.  See www.rti.com for details.

I have used PPP to connect not to the Internet but to a small internet
comprising up to 16 data acquisition systems running vxWorks on a LAN.
These machines send data to a 32-bit Windows machine for processing
and viewing.
With a patch applied to LCP.C, the vxWorks implementation appears to
connect to Win95 or Unix machines with no problems, and maintain a
solid connection.
Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Windows NT machines. The
problem is that Microsoft use two new authentication methods (CHAP80
which is also known as MSCHAP and Shiva PAP). When vxWorks attempts to
make a connection to Windows NT, the NT machine tries to negotiate for
these two authentication methods, even if the "use any authentication
method including clear text" option is selected. The vxWorks PPP
implementation can authenticate using CHAP MD5 or PAP but not CHAP80
or SPAP. Ideally, vxWorks should send a request for CHAP or PAP with
each configure NAK sent in response to requests for CHAP80 or SPAP,
but instead it sends only one configure request for an authentication
method near the start of negotiation. The result is that the
negotiation does not converge and the session is terminated.
This problem does not occur if the NT machine initiates the connection
to vxWorks.
I have reported the problem to Microsoft and WindRiver, but so far
have not got a solution.
I have not used PSOS and so cannot compare it with vxWorks.

Regards,
	Pete

Assuming you are using a network driver, the payload (data) will be in
the wrong byte order for the receiving processor.  Check out "man
htonl" family of functions for host-to-network byte order conversion.

I'm not sure about such things as socket headers.  An application must
offer up a sockaddr struct when calling socket().  I assume the app
would have to "htonl" (or whatever) any data it puts in the struct.

I've been sloppy about this, having only worked on big endian systems
to-date.  If (when?) I need to port my apps to a little endian
machine, I'm sure I'll learn the answer...:-)

Cheers, Bob

This was originally "C++ cout output disappeared."
I'm providing a code sample here and combination
of things that I tried.  One (desired) combination
led to the problem, while the other two has no
problem.  I hope someone can shed some light
here.  Thanks,
Raymond

C++ Code
========
void Dbg (int dbg_lvl, char * str1, int data1, int data2, int data3) {
   if (DEBUG_LEVEL >= dbg_lvl) {
      if (semTake (output_sema, sema_tmo) == ERROR)
         return;

      cout << "[" << taskName ( taskIdSelf () ) << "]: ";
      cout << str1 << " " << data1 << " " << data2 << " " << data3 << endl;

      semGive (output_sema);
   }
}
void CP_DISPATCHER_CLASS::ShowCpTaskStat (void) {
   int  inst_id;

   for (inst_id=0; inst_id < CP_MAX_NUM_OF_CALLS; inst_id++) {
      Dbg (LOW_DBG_LVL, "Inst ", inst_id, (int) cp_task [inst_id].state,
(int) cp_task [inst_id].call_id);
   }
}

Expected output is, for instance,   [CpDispatch]: Inst 1 0 45
Instead, actual output is,               1045
That is, all strings are missing, including the white space.

Combinations to reproduce the problem
=============================
I've tried 3 combinations, one of them (the desired combination) has the
problem:

#1. Set CONSOLE_TTY=NONE and INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT   => problem
#2. Set CONSOLE_TTY=0         and don't INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT => no
problem
#3. Set CONSOLE_TTY=NONE and don't INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT => no problem

When STARTUP script is used, C/C++ application is brought up vi script by
target shell.
When STARTUP script is not used, C/C++ application is brought up manually
via WindSh.

You might try looking in $WIND_HOME/target/src/drv/mem, on my system 
there is a file called flashMem.c which has some routines for reading and 
writing to FLASH.  Reading from FLASH can be done with a pointer, but 
writing involves some extra steps.  Hope this helps.

I'm not sure if this will help, but we transfer data between a 68040
vxWorks client and a PC running NT4.0.  We use Winsock for the TCP/IP end
on the PC side and the (psuedo?) standard Berkeley Sockets on the vxWorks
side.  The appropriate sockaddr structures must be set up appropriately on
both sides, and there is a host of documentation for this.  We mainly
transfer data TO the PC.  The following code snippits are a couple of
routines at the vxWorks end that rearrange the bytes for both an integer
array and a long integer array to a form readily useable on the PC side.
We don't do the reverse, but this should give you a feel for the byte
ordering.  It's not elegant, but it works.  It is possible that the canned
routines (htonl, etc.) may also work, but I haven't used them except in
conversion of internet addresses, etc.

Good luck -- Eli Wittner -- CTI Cyclotron Systems, Inc.

Subject: mv2603/4 and PCI bursting
--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"



We are working with an mv-2603 board, I have a Vmetro PCI analyzer
on eval, one thing that Im curious about is PCI burst transactions,
I don't see _ANY_ on this system.

We have a PMC video board on the mv2603, in addition to the DEC21140,
and the SCSI chip on the PCI bus.


I have enabled burst transfers in the video chip, and the Raven
chip has write posting on, yet no write bursts.


Does anyone know if its possible to do PCI burst transactions ?


OR do write bursts only occur when you have "WriteBack" cache ?


Thanks


Mike.
